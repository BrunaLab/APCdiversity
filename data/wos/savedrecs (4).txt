AB Stereotactic radiosurgery is a modern discipline that emerged after World War II. It represents a synthesis of an approach to patient care that was not immediately embraced by either neurosurgeons or radiation oncologists, but which has been shown, time and again, to be advantageous for the treatment of intracranial pathology. Indeed, stereotactic radiosurgical techniques are now being rapidly adapted and adopted for the treatment of extracranial malignant and benign disease. Any examination of the individuals, devices, and technological advances that permitted stereotactic radiosurgery to become a preferred approach for patient care cannot be absolutely comprehensive but can provide insights into the evolution of the specialty and potential future prospects for further improvements in patient care. As Shakespeare wrote in The Tempest, "What's past is prologue."

AB Stereotactic radiosurgery is a safe and effective technology that can address a variety of neurosurgical conditions, but in many parts of the world, access remains an issue. Although the technology is increasingly available in the United States, Canada, Europe, and parts of Asia, poor access to central nervous system (CNS) imaging and inadequate treatment equipment in other parts of the world limit the availability of radiosurgery as a treatment option. In addition, epidemiologic data about cancer and CNS metastases in low-income countries are sparse and much less complete than in more developed countries, and the need for radiosurgery may be underestimated as a result , Current radiosurgical platforms can be expensive to install and require a substantial amount of personnel training for safe operation. Socioeconomic and political forces are relevant to limitations to and opportunities for improving access to care. Here we examine the current barriers to access and propose areas for future efforts to improve global availability of radiosurgery for neurosurgical conditions.

AB Radiation therapy represents a mainstay of treatment for patients with brain metastases. Recently, the widespread adoption of immune checkpoint blockade has led to keen interest in treating cancers with checkpoint inhibitors in place of, or as an adjunct to, traditional chemotherapy. However, with the exception of melanoma, immune checkpoint blockade in solid tumors has failed to achieve significant brain control in patients with brain metastases. The possibility of combining immune checkpoint blockade with radiation for the treatment of brain and other metastases represents an exciting new strategy that is in its early stages of investigation. Success with this combinatorial strategy has the potential to result in enhanced rates of brain control, less brain exposure to radiation, and improved cognitive outcomes. In this review, we discuss the mechanisms behind this synergy, describe its limitations, and suggest ways to move the field forward.

AB OBJECTIVE: We used magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to assess the radiological status of the multifidus muscles (MFMs) after biportal endoscopic spinal surgery (BESS) and evaluated the extent of MFM injury and atrophy.
   METHODS: A total of 88 patients who had met the inclusion and exclusion criteria were enrolled in the present study. T2-weighted signal intensity MRI was performed 3 times: preoperatively, immediately postoperatively, and at the final follow-up examination. We measured the cross-sectional area of the MFM on both sides (ipsilaterally and contralaterally) and recorded the operative times. The association between the interval from surgery to the final follow-up MRI and changes in the MFMs and between the operative time and changes in the MFMs were analyzed. For the group comparisons, the patients were divided into 3 groups according to the follow-up interval. Group 1 was followed up within 2 weeks, group 2 within 2-4 weeks, and group 3 after 4 weeks. The MFM changes were recorded.
   RESULTS: The operative time correlated significantly with the percentage of change in the T2-weighted signal intensity ratio (SIR) for both sides (P < 0.01). At the final follow-up examination, the SIR of the ipsilateral side had decreased in group 3 (P = 0.002). The percentage of change in the SIR was smallest in group 3 (P = 0.004).
   CONCLUSIONS: The MFM change on MRI after BESS became significant on both sides as the operative time increased. However, the change showed a tendency to reverse within several months, and no substantial change in the MFM cross-sectional area was found. We have concluded that MFM changes after BESS might correlate with an increased operative time but will resolve over time.

AB INTRODUCTION: Postlaminectomy syndrome (PLS) or failed back surgery syndrome is a condition characterized by persistent pain following a back surgery. Degenerative processes may result in foramina' stenosis development over time, even after a successful surgery. Percutaneous endoscopic lumbar foraminotomy (PELF) offers a minimally invasive means of treating foraminal stenosis after a back surgery. The objective of this study was to evaluate the outcomes of PELF for foraminal stenosis with PLS in geriatric patients.
   METHODS: Two-year follow-up data were collected from 21 consecutive patients aged 65 years or older (mean age, 72.4 years) who underwent PELF for foraminal stenosis with PLS. Transforaminal endoscopic foraminal decompression was performed under local anesthesia. Outcomes were assessed using visual analog scale pain score, Oswestry Disability Index, and modified Macnab criteria.
   RESULTS: Mean visual analog scale for leg pain improved from 8.48 at baseline to 3.33 at 6 weeks, 2.10 at 1 year, and 2.19 at 2 years after PELF (P < 0.01). Mean Oswestry Disability Index Unproved from 67.29 at baseline to 30.69 at 6 weeks, 22.50 at 1 year, and 20.81 at 2 years after PELF (P < 0.01). Based on the modified Macnab criteria, excellent or good results were obtained in 81.0% of patients and symptomatic improvements were obtained in 95.2% of patients.
   CONCLUSIONS: The transforaminal endoscopic approach can provide a better access angle to achieve a sophisticated foraminal decompression with less facet and dural injury. Therefore, PELF under local anesthesia can be useful for PLS or postoperative foraminal stenosis in elderly patients.

ID DURAL ARTERIOVENOUS-FISTULAS; CLINICAL-FEATURES; SURGICAL-TREATMENT
AB BACKGROUND: Vascular malformations of the spinal cord are a rare and complex clinical entity and can lead to severe morbidity with progressive spinal cord symptoms if not treated properly. In early stages, the disease is characterized by slowly progressive, nonspecific symptoms, such as gait disturbance, paresthesia, diffuse sensory symptoms, and radicular pain; in the late stages, bowel and bladder incontinence, erectile dysfunction, and urinary retention may develop. In recent decades, understanding and treatment of spinal vascular malformations have improved with the evolution of diagnostic tools and treatment modalities; however, it is still difficult to manage these cases because of the complexity of the pathology. The aims of this study were to present the long-term outcomes of our patients and to discuss the optimal management strategies.
   METHODS: We reviewed the records of 78 patients with spinal vascular malformations and performed a retrospective, single-center case series evaluating initial occlusion, recanalization, retreatment, and neurologic status of patients with dural arteriovenous fistulas, perimedullary arteriovenous fistulas, arteriovenous malformations, and extradural arteriovenous fistulas who had undergone embolization and/or surgery.
   RESULTS: No mortality was observed. Complete obliteration was achieved in 76 patients (97.4%).
   CONCLUSIONS: Both endovascular and surgical treatment of spinal vascular malformations resulted in significant long-term recovery from myelopathic symptoms and improvement in quality of life for most patients.

AB BACKGROUND: Poorly understood cranial fluid accumulations are frequently observed after decompressive craniectomy and often termed "external hydrocephalus." These findings are difficult to explain using traditional models of hydrocephalus.
   METHODS: Representative cases, clinical management, and literature overview are presented.
   RESULTS: We present a hypothesis that abnormal cranial fluid accumulations develop after decompressive craniectomy in a vulnerable subset of patients as a result of 1) the large compliant cranial defect with durotomy causing reduced internal brain expansion, ventricular squeezing, and pulsatile cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) circulation; 2) impaired pulsatile CSF flow along major cerebral arteries and the adjoining perivascular spaces (Virchow-Robin spaces); 3) reduced clearance of interstitial fluid by the glymphatic system; and 4) redistribution of CSF from the subarachnoid space into the subdural and subgaleal compartments and the ventricles.
   CONCLUSION: Closure of the cranial defect with cranioplasty improves cerebral blood flow and CSF pulsatile circulation and is frequently sufficient to resolve the external hydrocephalus.

AB BACKGROUND: Cervical spine trauma (CST) may result in vertebral artery injury (VAI), increasing the risk of developing stroke. Stroke risk following CST is poorly reported.
   METHODS: In total, 729 patients with CST were retrospectively analyzed, including rates of VAI, age at injury, cause of injury, cardiovascular history, smoking history, substance abuse history, embolization therapy, and antiplatelet or anticoagulant therapy prior or after injury. VAIs were identified and graded following the Modified Denver Criteria for Blunt Cerebrovascular Injury using magnetic resonance angiography and computed tomography angiography. Brain scans were reviewed for stroke rates and statistically significant variations.
   RESULTS: Thirty-three patients suffered penetrating trauma, whereas 696 patients experienced blunt trauma. In total, 81 patients met the criteria for analysis with confirmed VAI. VAI was more common in penetrating injury group compared with blunt injury group (64% vs. 9%, P < 0.0005). However, low-grade VAI (less than grade III) was more common in blunt injury group versus penetrating group (37% vs. 14%, P < 0.05). The frequency of posterior circulation strokes did not vary significantly between groups (26.3% vs. 13.8%, P = 0.21). Cardiovascular comorbidities were significantly more common in the blunt group (50%, P = 0.0001) compared with the penetrating group (0%).
   CONCLUSIONS: VAI occurs with a high incidence in penetrating CST. Although stroke risk following penetrating and blunt CST did not vary significantly, they resulted in serious complications in a group of patients. Further study of this patient population is required to provide high-level, evidence-based preventions for VAI complications.

AB BACKGROUND: Patients with chronic renal failure undergoing hemodialysis have been shown to have poor overall health, osteoporosis, and altered bone metabolism. However, the impact of hemodialysis on patient outcomes after spinal fusion remains unknown. We sought to assess the effect of dialysis on 30-day perioperative and postoperative outcomes after cervical and lumbar fusion for pathologic compression fractures.
   METHODS: We queried the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program from 2009 to 2016 for patients undergoing cervical or lumbar fusion for compression fractures. Three-to-one propensity score matching using sex, age, body mass index, and number of operated levels was used to match patients not undergoing dialysis with those undergoing dialysis. Multivariable conditional regression was used to identify the association between dialysis and 30-day clinical outcomes, after adjusting for confounders.
   RESULTS: A total of 48,492 patients undergoing cervical fusion were identified; 156 (0.32%) of these were on dialysis. On multivariable regression, dialysis dependency was associated with increased operative time (regression coefficient [coef.], 15.93; 95% CI, 0.4-31.5; P = 0.045), length of stay (coef. 6.06; 95% CI, 4.64-7.48; P < 0.001), 30-day readmissions (odds ratio [OR], 1.07; 95% CI, 1.02-1.12; P = 0.009), any complications (OR 1.08; 95% CI, 1.03-1.13; P = 0.002), and serious complications (OR, 1.08; 95% CI, 1.02-1.14; P = 0.012). A total of 25,417 patients undergoing lumbar fusion were identified; 51 of these (0.2%) were on dialysis. On multivariable regression, dialysis dependency was associated with significantly higher length of stay (coef. 2.98; 95% CI, 1.28-468; P < 0.001).
   CONCLUSIONS: Our analyses indicated that dialysis dependency is associated with poor perioperative and postoperative outcomes after cervical/lumbar fusion for pathologic compression fractures.

TI Unexpectedly Smaller Artifacts of 3.0-T Magnetic Resonance Imaging than
   1.5 T: Recommendation of 3.0-T Scanners for Patients with
   Magnet-Resistant Adjustable Ventriculoperitoneal Shunt Devices
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY

ID SUSCEPTIBILITY ARTIFACTS
AB BACKGROUND: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) artifacts of adjustable shunt devices are thought to be similar to metal clip artifacts, in that they are larger with higher field strength scanners. We have published several reports about the artifacts of new MRI-resistant adjustable shunt devices, and we found a case in which a 3.0-T scanner showed smaller artifacts than the 1.5-T scanner. We aimed to clarify whether this claim is true or not.
   METHODS: Under permission of our institutional Ethical Committee, 2 volunteers underwent imaging studies using 3.0-T and 1.5-T scanners from GE, Siemens, and Philips. Four MRI-resistant adjustable shunt devices-proGAV2.0 (Miethke), Codman Certas Plus (Johnson & Johnson), Polaris (Sophysa), and Strata MR valve (Medtronic)-were fixed on the left temporal scalp. Routine MRI images, including T1-and T2-weighted imaging, fluid-attenuated inversion recovery, diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), and magnetic resonance angiography (MRA), were obtained. We also compared artifacts between a 3.0-T scanner and a-1.5 T scanner in 4 patients.
   RESULTS: The 3.0 T-scanners showed smaller artifacts than the 1.5-T scanners on DWI and MRA images for all shunt devices and scanners. In the other sequences, the results depended on the MRI scanner manufacturer; however, the GE 3.0-T scanner showed smaller artifacts in every sequence. This was also true in the 4 clinical cases.
   CONCLUSIONS: A 3.0-T scanner is recommended over a 1.5-T scanner for patients with MRI-resistant adjustable shunt devices in the diagnosis of acute ischemic condition or when using GE scanners.

AB BACKGROUND: Lateral interbody fusion (LW) is an effective adjuvant for circumferential minimally invasive surgery (CMIS) treatment of adult spinal deformity (ASD). Accessing L5-S1 via an oblique LIF (OLIF) approach (OLIF 5-1) allows for anterior LIF (ALIF) at the lumbosacral junction without repositioning the patient. We review the early outcomes and complications of OLIF 5-1 at the bottom of a long construct for an MIS approach to treat ASD.
   METHODS: We queried a prospectively collected registry of 111 consecutive patients with ASD (Cobb angle >20 degrees, sagittal vertical alignment [SVA] >50, or pelvic inci- dence [PO-lumbar lordosis [LL] mismatch>10) patients who underwent CMIS correction between January 2015 and January 2019. Sixty patients had >= 4 levels fused and OLIF 5-1. Multilevel pre-psoas LIF + OLIF 5-1 were performed in the first stage. Three days later, stage 2 involved MIS installation of pedicle screws with aggressive rod contouring and derotation/translation.
   RESULTS: The mean patient age was 66.8 years (range, 48-79 years), and the mean duration of follow-up was 24 months (range, 3-60 months). A mean of 7 levels were fused (range, 4-9). Significant improvements in L5-S1 segmental lordosis (SL), LL, SVA, PI-LL mismatch, and pelvic tilt were seen following the first stage (P < 0.05). There was no intraoperative vascular, ureteral, or sympathetic chain injury, and no transient or permanent lumbar plexopathy. In 2 patients, OLIF 5-1 was abandoned due to difficult access, and transforaminal LIF was done at L5-S1 at the second stage. Five patients required intraoperative transfusion. No patient experienced postoperative ileus or L5-S1 pseudarthrosis. Significant improvements in visual analog scale pain score, Oswestry Disability Index, 36-Item Short Form Health Survey, and Scoliosis Research Society Outcomes Questionnaire were found.
   CONCLUSIONS: A single-position MIS OLIF 5-1 at the bottom of a long construct in conjunction with multilevel pre-psoas LIF seems to be a safe and effective technique for improving SL, global LL, and SVA with a low risk of perioperative and postoperative complications.

AB OBJECTIVE: Plurihormonal pituitary adenomas (PPAs) have recently been divided into 2 subtypes: pituitary specific transcription factor 1-positive plurihormonal pituitary adenomas (PIT-1 + PPAs) and plurihormonal adenomas with unusual immunohistochemical combinations (PAwUIC). The purpose of this study was to review patients with PPAs, elucidate their clinicopathologic characteristics, and present the surgical results.
   METHODS: Records were analyzed for 665 patients who underwent endoscopic endonasal transsphenoidal surgery for pituitary adenomas between 2007 and 2018. Data were reviewed for 27 patients who met the definition of PPAs and delineated regarding clinical, radiologic, pathologic features, and surgical outcomes.
   RESULTS: Of the 27 patients, 18 had PAwUIC, and 9 patients were diagnosed with PIT-1 + PPAs. Twenty-four patients (88.8%) had macroadenomas, including 6 giant adenomas (>= 4 cm) (22.2%). Cavernous sinus invasion was found in 12 patients (44.4%). Pathologic examinations showed high aggressivity in nearly half of the patients. Most patients with PAwUIC (77.8%) had features of nonfunctioning pituitary adenomas, and only 4 had features of hormone-secreting pituitary adenomas. Gross total resection rates were 57.1% for PAwUIC and 771% for PIT-1 + PPAs. The remission rate for hormone-secreting pituitary adenomas was 100% in this case series. Mean follow-up was 74.4 +/- 33 months (range, 6-121 months) for overall groups.
   CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the first study to describe the clinicopathologic features of newly classified PPAs, which are characterized by aggressive behavior with higher values of percentage of cavernous sinus invasion. Relevant pathologic diagnosis of PPAs is crucial for appropriate management and follow-up.

AB OBJECTIVES: To identify predictors of atherosclerotic change in aneurysms and parent arteries, and to retrospectively analyze outcomes from clipped aneurysms that showed atherosclerotic changes.
   METHODS: Between May 2017 and April 2018, we collected a total of 151 clipping cases and reviewed records of operation videos to classify atherosclerosis by location (dome, neck of aneurysm, or parent artery). To identify predictors of atherosclerotic change in aneurysms, we analyzed baseline demographic characteristics, preoperative images, and Framingham Risk Scores (FRS). We also analyzed incomplete clipping cases according to atherosclerosis presence and location.
   RESULT: This study cohort included 110 women (mean age, 59.3 +/- 7.1 years) and 41 men (mean age, 55.9 +/- 9.6 years). Atherosclerotic change was seen in 77 cases. FRS, diabetes mellitus, and aneurysm size were identified as independent risk factors for atherosclerotic change in multivariate logistic regression analysis. There were 11 incomplete clipping cases (7.2%). Among the 30 cases with atherosclerotic change in the neck were 10 cases of incomplete clipping (P < 0.001).
   CONCLUSIONS: FRS, diabetes mellitus, and aneurysm size as predictors of atherosclerosis in patients undergoing aneurysm surgery can help guide surgical decisions and performance.

AB BACKGROUND: Multimodality monitoring is used frequently to guide care of patients with severe acute brain injury. The aim of this study was to examine the safety and reliability of multimodality monitoring.
   METHODS: From a prospective observational database at a Level I trauma center, 501 patients, including 300 men and 201 women (mean age 58 +/- 39 years) were identified retrospectively. Each patient received a triple-lumen bolt and 3 monitors: intracranial pressure, brain temperature, and brain oxygen. Intensive care unit and hospital records were examined to identify complications, reasons for device replacement, malfunction and infection. Head computed tomography (CT) scans performed before and after the monitors were inserted were examined for evidence of monitor-related adverse effects.
   RESULTS: A total of 696 triple-lumen bolts were placed. Median duration of monitoring was 78.88 hours (interquartile range, 33.0-133.2 hours). Bilateral monitors were inserted in 22 (3.16%) patients. Ten (1.43%) monitors were replaced to allow magnetic resonance imaging, and 40 (5.74%) monitors were replaced to facilitate additional cranial surgery. Of 35 (5.02%) monitors that were replaced because they were thought to not be functioning properly, 19 (54.29%) were subsequently found to be functioning normally. Follow-up CT scans were compared with CT scans obtained before insertion of monitors; 9 (2.13%) small contusions and 10 (2.36%) extra-axial hematomas associated with the devices were identified. Based on the CT findings, the hematomas were thought to be associated with the insertion technique rather than the device; 4 hematomas required treatment. Twenty-two (3.16%) devices were incorrectly placed (e.g., the probe was in an infarct or an already existing contusion). Only 1 associated infection was identified.
   CONCLUSIONS: Placement of intracranial monitors for multimodality neuromonitoring using a triple-lumen bolt appears to be safe. The complication rate is similar to published complication rates for single-lumen bolts and single monitors.

AB BACKGROUND: The central retinal artery (CRA) has -on described as one of the first branches of the ophthalmic artery. It arises medial to the ciliary ganglion and after a sinuous path within the orbital cavity it penetrates the lower surface of the dura mater that covers the optic nerve, approximately 1 cm behind the eyeball. However, the numerous anatomic descriptions that were made of the CRA have been insufficient or unclear in relation to certain characteristics that are analyzed in the present study.
   METHODS: An electronic literature search was made in the PubMed database and a cadaver dissection was performed on 11 orbits fixed in formaldehyde.
   RESULTS: Results were obtained regarding the source, collateral branches, curves, direction, length of the optic nerve, dural perforation site, distance, path and relations, diameter, and area of the central artery of the retina.
   CONCLUSIONS: Our anatomic study innovates in 2 as-pects of the CRA: area and curves. Not only was there a simple count of the number of curves, but it also analyzed the angle presented by each of the curves based on photos obtained in high definition, with a digital program to reduce the margin of error. These curvatures of the CRA were classified according to their spatial disposition within the orbital cavity based on a pattern that was easy to understand, Data were obtained from the area of the CRA on the penetration of the CRA into the dural sheath of the optic nerve.

ID OPERATING MICROSCOPE; VITOM; EXPERIENCE; GUIDANCE; REMOVAL; SYSTEM
AB BACKGROUND: Anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF) remains one of the most commonly taught procedures during residency and one of the most frequently performed by neurosurgeons. Neurosurgeons use microscopes to perform surgery and to train other surgeons. Although the microscope provides excellent illumination and magnification, its use will be limited to 2 people: the surgeon and the assistant. Consequently, the scrub nurse and residents watching 2-dimensional images on monitors will have a reduced perception of the surgical field depth and anatomical details. The exoscope has been introduced as an alternative to microscopes and endoscopes. We used a 3-dimensional (3D), high-definition exoscope (30 Vitom [Karl Storz, Tuttlingen, Germany]) in 2 patients undergoing 2-level ACDF for cervical myeloradiculopathy.
   METHODS: The exoscope was used during soft tissue dissection, discectomy, osteophytectomy, and cage insertion. Microsurgical drilling of the posterior osteophytes, which will usually require adequate magnification and proper microscope angulation, was also performed using the exoscope.
   RESULTS: The exoscope provided a 3D view of the surgical field similar to that provided by a microscope and allowed us to effectively and safely perform the required surgical steps. The main advantage of 3D exoscopeassisted surgery, compared with microscope-assisted surgery, is the possibility to generate videos with a similar view and image quality as perceived by the surgeon. Therefore, the didactic capabilities of exoscopic videos are greater than those provided by microscopic videos. Exoscopes are also smaller compared with microscopes, allowing for comfortable use from the early surgical steps to device implantation.
   CONCLUSION: We believe that exoscope-assisted surgery could become a safe and effective alternative to microscope-assisted surgery in ACDF.

AB OBJECTIVE: We sought to assess the impact of 5-aminolevulinic acid (5-ALA) and low-field intraoperative magnetic resonance imaging (iMRI) on the extent of resection of high-grade gliomas (HGGs). Results are compared with those obtained when using 5-ALA and iMRI separately.
   METHODS: We retrospectively included patients with an HGG eligible for gross total resection (GTR) from January 2013 to January 2018. Patients were included according to 5-ALA surgical guidance (5A-group), iMRI (iMRI-group), or both (5A-iMRI-group). Surgical variables were registered, and presurgical and postsurgical radiologic and clinical variables were analyzed. Extent of resection >= 90%, complications, and new permanent neurologic deficit were compared using the chi-squared and analysis of variance tests. Other variables studied were mortality, average hospital stay, surgical time, and Karnofsky Performance Scale status before and after surgery.
   RESULTS: Most of the 118 procedures carried out were in men (59.2%). The mean age was 58 years. Sixty patients (50.8%) were operated on using exclusively 5-ALA assistance (5A-group), 19 (16.1%) using iMRI (iMRI-group), and 39 (33%) combining both techniques (5A-IMRI-group). There were no statistically significant differences among 3 groups regarding extent of resection 90 >= (73% 5A, 73.7% iMRI, 71.8% 5A-iMRI, P = 0.94); complication rates (18.3% 5A, 5.3% iMRI, 7.7% 5A-iMRI, P = 0.17); new or worsening of preexisting neurologic deficit at 1-month follow-up (13.3% 5A, 10.5% iMRI, 15.4% 5A-iMRI, P = 0.26); average hospital stay in days (9.5 5A, 6.4 iMRI, 7.6 5A-iMRI, P = 0.18); Karnofsky Performance Scale; nor surgical time in minutes (212.4 5A, 187.9 iMRI, 201.4 5A-iMRI, P = 0.13).
   CONCLUSIONS: In our experience, combined use of iMRI and 5-ALA does not improve the studied variables when compared with those technologies when used separately, even though a slight tendency of a superior effectiveness is observed when using iMRI individually.

AB BACKGROUND: Acute subdural hemorrhage often occurs in those >= 65 years of age after trauma and tends to yield poor clinical outcomes. Previous studies have demonstrated a propensity toward high in-hospital mortality rates in this population; however, postdischarge mortality data are limited. The objective of the present study was to analyze short- and long-term mortality data after acute traumatic subdural hemorrhage in the geriatric population as well as review the impact of associated clinical variables including mechanism of injury, pre-morbid antithrombotic use, and need for surgical decompression on mortality rates.
   METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 455 patients who presented with an isolated traumatic acute subdural hemorrhage to our level-1 trauma center over a 5 year period using our data registry. Patients were then cross-referenced in the National Social Security Death Index for postdischarge mortality rates. United States life tables were used for peer-controlled actuarial comparisons.
   RESULTS: Acute traumatic subdural hemorrhage is often a fatal injury in the geriatric population, especially if taking antithrombotics or requiring surgical decompression. Specifically, they have greater in-hospital mortality rates than adults with similar injuries and have significantly lower survival rates for several years following discharge compared with their peer-matched controls.
   CONCLUSIONS: Here, we found that age is a significant predictor of both short- and long-term survival after acute traumatic subdural hemorrhage. Moreover, the present study corroborates that the need for surgical decompression or the use of pre-morbid antithrombotic medications is associated with increased overall mortality.

AB BACKGROUND: Chiari I malformation (CMI) and the topics concerning it have been the subject of numerous discussions and polarizing controversies over the course of the last 20 years.
   METHODS: The opinions of 63 recognized international CMI experts from 4 continents, with a collective surgical experience of >15,000 CMI cases, were gathered through a detailed questionnaire.
   RESULTS: Three facts emerged from the analysis of the results.
   1) Most of the replies showed a high level of consensus on most CMI-related topics.
   2) Several topics, which had been considered controversial as recently as 10 years ago, are now more widely accepted.
   3) The so-called 5-mm rule was rejected by 88.5% of the CMI experts who responded to the questionnaire.
   CONCLUSIONS: Sixty three recognized international CMI experts from 4 continents, with a collective surgical experience of >15,000 CMI cases were polled about a number of CMI topics. The results showed a high level of consensus, as well as a paradigm shift.

   MANAGEMENT; SURVIVAL; EXTENT
AB BACKGROUND: it basal ganglia and thalamus are uncommon locations for infiltrating gliomas. Tumors here are usually managed with biopsy and adjuvant therapy, with relatively poor results. Rarely do patients undergo extensive surgical intervention. It seems reasonable to suggest that successful cytoreduction may help these patients. However, this hypothesis has not been studied because of the general view that it is not possible to remove deep-seated brain tumors with acceptable outcomes.
   METHODS: Through retrospective data collection, we describe a small case series of patients undergoing awake contralateral, transcallosal surgery for deep-seated brain tumors affecting the basal ganglia. We describe our patient cohort, report on patient outcomes, and describe our surgical technique.
   RESULTS: Four patients underwent awake contralateral, transcallosal surgery for glioblastoma invading the basal ganglia. All 4 patients demonstrated hemibody weakness contralateral to the side of their tumors, with 3 patients confined to wheelchairs at presentation. Their ages ranged from 25 to 64 years. Tumor volumes ranged from 14 to 93 cm(3). More than 50% resection of each tumor was achieved during surgery. In 2 cases, approximately 90% resection was achieved. Motor strength improved in 1 patient who presented with hemiplegia. Two patients required ventriculoperitoneal shunting for complications related to hydrocephalus. At the writing of this article, 2 of our patients were still alive, functional, and free of tumor progression.
   CONCLUSIONS: We present the results of our attempts to resect large gliomas infiltrating the basal ganglia in 4 patients. Our technique combined a contralateral, transcallosal approach with awake neuromonitoring. Our results suggest it is possible to remove these tumors with reasonable outcomes.

AB BACKGROUND: The development of venous outflow stenosis in cerebral arteriovenous malformation (AVM) is poorly understood. The location of stenosis within the AVM draining vein in relation to the adjacent venous sinus and the hypothesis that the ratio of draining vein to adjacent sinus diameter might predict the development of venous stenosis were explored.
   METHODS: Patients with supratentorial AVMs (1997-2018) were reviewed (N = 290). AVM draining vein and adjacent venous sinus diameters, degree of draining vein stenosis, and distance from the maximal stenotic point to the junction of the adjacent draining sinus were recorded. Correlation between percentage of AVM draining vein stenosis and the ratio of AVM draining vein to venous sinus diameters was analyzed.
   RESULTS: A total of 360 draining veins in 243 AVMs with complete angiographic data were measured. Venous stenosis (in 131 draining veins) was observed within 20 mm of the junction to the adjacent draining sinus in 85% of our sample. The ratio of draining vein to adjacent sinus diameter correlated positively with the percentage of venous stenosis (P < 0.01, r = 0.21). The ratio between 0.51-1.0 and >1.0 showed significant tighter stenosis compared with the ratio <= 0.5 (25.9% and 28.9% vs. 10.0%, respectively; P < 0.01).
   CONCLUSIONS: AVM venous outflow stenosis is observed close to the adjacent venous sinus junction. The degree of venous stenosis is greater when the ratio of AVM draining vein/adjacent venous sinus diameter is >0.5. This may be related to more turbulent flow at the junction of the draining vein and venous sinus, especially in larger draining veins, which causes venous stenosis to develop over time.

AB BACKGROUND: Encephaloduroarteriosynangiosis (EDAS) is a commonly used indirect revascularization operation method to treat pediatric patients with Moyamoya disease (MMD). Arachnoid dissection frequently has been performed during the EDAS operation to promote better revascularization. However, no studies have yet proven its surgical benefits. In this study, we investigated the impact of arachnoid preservation on the surgical outcome and postoperative complication by comparing pediatric patients with MMD who had the arachnoid membrane preserved during EDAS operation with those who had it dissected.
   METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study based on a single surgeon's experience at a single institution. A total of 206 pediatric patients with MMD who underwent EDAS operation at Seoul National University Children's Hospital were recruited for the study. We compared the surgical outcome and the postoperation complication rate of these 2 groups. Furthermore, risk factors for postoperative complication were analyzed.
   RESULTS: The overall clinical outcome (P = 0.342) and the extent of revascularization of middle cerebral artery territories (P = 0.736) were not different between the arachnoid dissection group and the arachnoid preservation group. However, the postoperative infarction/hemorrhage rate was significantly greater in the arachnoid dissection group (P = 0.005). Arachnoid dissection (P = 0.011) and young age (<3 years old, P = 0.012) were significantly associated with increased risk of postoperative complications.
   CONCLUSIONS: Arachnoid preservation may help to reduce postoperative complications without decreasing the surgical outcome of EDAS. Furthermore, factors such as the patient's age should be taken into account when treating pediatric patients with MMD.

AB BACKGROUND: A considerable propotion of patients with cancer got thoracolumbar vertebral metastatic epidural spinal cord compression, which affected their quality of life. Traditional surgical management involves early decompression with concomitant spine stabilization with long instrumentation. However, complications are caused by massive blood loss and long operation time. This study aimed to compare the safety and efficacy of short posterior instrumentation with kyphoplasty and the traditional method for thoracolumbar metastatic epidural spinal cord compression.
   METHODS: Between January 2004 and December 2015, a retrospective study was conducted on 120 patients with metastatic epidural spinal cord compression from T6 to L5 and divided into 2 groups: short posterior instrumentation with the balloon kyphoplasty group (group I, n = 50) and the long posterior instrumentation group (group II, n = 70). The clinical and radiographic parameters of patients in the 2 groups were compared with a nonrandomized cohort method. Patients were followed up from 3 to 40 months after surgery according to survival time.
   RESULTS: In group I, the surgery had a mean blood loss of 650 mL and a survival time of 19.1 months. In group II, the surgery had a mean blood loss of 2100 mL and a survival time of 14.14 months. A significant difference in blood loss amount (P = 0.002) was observed. Complications, including deep wound infection, durotomy, and uncontrolled bleeding, were observed in both groups. No postoperative cement-induced neurologic deterioration, implant failure occurred.
   CONCLUSIONS: Kyphoplasty with short posterior instrumentation is a novel technique that can be performed safely and effectively for the treatment of thoracolumbar metastatic epidural spinal cord compression. Rigid stability, reduced blood loss, and short fixation decrease surgical morbidity of spinal metastasis.

AB OBJECTIVE: Secreted phosphoprotein 1 (SPP1) is an important extracellular glycoprotein that is associated with immune regulation, tumorigenesis, and cell signaling. However, the prognostic value of SPP1 in patients with glioma has not yet been clarified, especially in lower-grade gliomas. The objective of this study is to evaluate the prognostic merit of SPP1 in lower-grade gliomas.
   METHODS: The messenger RNA (mRNA) expression of SPP1 in about 1000 cancer cell lines was explored by using the data from the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia database. The Oncomine database was mined to evaluate the mRNA expression of SPP1 in lower-grade glioma, glioblastoma, and normal brain tissues. The correlation between SPP1 mRNA expression and overall survival of patients with glioma from The Cancer Genome Atlas database was analyzed.
   RESULTS: SPP1 mRNA expression of glioma was ranked as the eighth highest of all cancer cell lines in the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia database. The data from the Oncomine database suggested that SPP1 expression was significantly high in glioblastoma compared with normal brain tissues but was not significantly high in lower-grade glioma compared with normal brain tissue. Analysis of the RNA-Seq data from The Cancer Genome Atlas database showed that the increased SPP1 mRNA expression in lower-grade glioma was significantly associated with poor survival outcomes in patients with lower-grade glioma. Multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that SPP1 might be considered as an independent prognostic factor in lower-grade gliomas.
   CONCLUSIONS: The present study showed that SPP1 overexpression is related to worse overall survival in patients with lower-grade glioma. Moreover, SPP1 could be considered as an independent factor in lower-grade gliomas.

AB BACKGROUND: Idiopathic scoliosis is the most common spinal disorder in the pediatric population. The goals of treatment for pediatric idiopathic scoliosis are to correct deformity, prevent curve progression, restore trunk symmetry and balance, and minimize pain and morbidity. Surgical treatment has advanced significantly, from the advent of segmental pedicle screw instrumentation several decades ago to the recent development of robotic-assisted surgery and growth-modulating fusionless surgery. The objective of the present study was to review the reported data on emerging techniques in the surgical treatment of idiopathic scoliosis in children and adolescents.
   METHODS: The PubMed and Google Scholar electronic databases were used to identify studies that had examined new emerging techniques in the surgical treatment of idiopathic scoliosis in children and adolescents.
   RESULTS: Major developments in the surgical techniques for pediatric idiopathic scoliosis have included robotic-assisted pedicle screw placement, vertebral body stapling, vertebral body tethering, magnetically controlled growing rods, ApiFix (not currently approved for use in the United States by the Food and Drug Administration), and sublaminar polyester bands. Such growth-modulating fusionless surgical techniques have received increasing attention in recent years, especially for the younger pediatric scoliosis population with significant growth potential remaining.
   CONCLUSIONS: Various emerging techniques in the surgical treatment of idiopathic scoliosis in children and adolescents have demonstrated promising results in the reported data thus far. However, longer term prospective studies with larger cohorts are necessary to better evaluate their safety and efficacy.

ID SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA; CORD-INJURY; NEUROSURGERY; DISEASE
AB BACKGROUND: Spine conditions are common and the surgery is evolving even in developed economies. This study aims to review the changing trends and challenges of spine surgery, particularly from a low-income country.
   METHODS: This is a retrospective study of patients who were surgically treated for spine conditions in Enugu, Nigeria. Patient records from 2006 to 2016 were reviewed. Relevant clinical information was extracted from the operation theater logbooks and patient case files.
   RESULTS: A total of 463 spine surgical procedures were carried out on the same number of patients. The number of treated patients has been on the increase and shows a male predominance. Pediatric spine cases accounted for 1.5%, adult/middle aged patients accounted for 77.8%. Degenerative conditions, trauma, and neoplasms were the most frequent indications for operation, accounting for 52.3%, 30.5%, and 11.4%, respectively. The most commonly operated region was cervical and lumbar regions among male (49.3%) and female (51.8%) patients, respectively. Spine fixation was required in 137 patients (29.6%). A paradigm shift from trauma to degenerative conditions among patients was noted after 2010. Prior to 2009, spine wiring techniques were the most common spine stabilizing method, but from 2011 to 2013 anterior cervical discectomy and anterior cervical discectomy and fusion predominated, and thereafter pedicle screws predominated. Cost implications, lack of trained personnel, and lack of and basic equipment pose significant challenges to spine care.
   CONCLUSIONS: The trend in spinal surgery has improved rapidly and consistently in Nigeria over the 10 years of the study and is related to increasing expertise, more available facilities, and implant availability.

AB OBJECTIVE: To present values for the dose parameters predictive of alopecia as an adverse effect induced by neuroembolization using a biplane fluoroscopy.
   METHODS: This study included a total of 151 patients (52 men, mean age of 55.1 +/- 12.2 years) treated for intracranial neuroembolization between 2014 to 2018 with the following criteria: 1) obtainable dose report with digital subtraction angiographic image records, 2) no history of radiation exposure 6 months prior to the first procedure, and 3) and clinical follow-up performed through 12 months following the procedure. Patients were divided into 2 groups according to their presentation of alopecia during the follow-up period.
   RESULTS: Eighteen (11.9%) patients developed alopecia 10 to 30 days after the procedure (average: 18.5 +/- 5.3 days). Sixteen (88.9%) patients in the alopecia group were affected by projection of the A-plane fluoroscopy. Area under the receiver operating characteristic analysis curves of 0.865 (P = 0.000) and 0.831 (P = 0.000) were used to compute the optimal A-plane dose area product (255.4 Gy-cm(2); sensitivity: 0.875; specificity: 0.805; Youden J = 0.682) and cumulative dose (4437.5 mGy; sensitivity, 0.750; specificity, 0.805; Youden J = 0.556) cutoff values, respectively, capable of distinguishing patients with alopecia (n = 16) from subtotal patients (n = 149).
   CONCLUSIONS: The dose area product and the cumulative dose may be useful, intuitive factors for predicting the adverse effects of the neurointerventional radiation. Further multicenter research should be performed to confirm the efficacy and utility of the reference values of dose area product and cumulative dose for preventing excessive irradiation during neurointerventional procedures.

AB OBJECTIVE: The pathogenesis of Chiari malformation type 1 (CM-1)-associated Valsalva headache is unknown, but it may be caused by abnormal cerebellar tonsil tissue strain. Advances in cardiac-gated magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques such as balanced fast-field echo (bFFE) allow quantification of the motion of anatomic structures and can be used to measure tissue strain. The current study investigated the relationship between Valsalva heachache and tonsillar motion in patients with CM-1.
   METHODS: A retrospective review of patients with CM-1 who had undergone cardiac-gated bFFE MRI was performed. Headache symptoms were retrieved from the medical records. Anatomic landmarks were manually selected on the tine bFFE, and a validated motion-tracking software was used to assess motion over the cardiac cycle in patients at rest. For each patient, displacement, strain, and strain rate were calculated for 3 anatomic segments. Patients undergoing surgery were examined before and after surgery.
   RESULTS: From 88 patients, a total of 108 bFFE sequences were analyzed. Valsalva headache was present in 50% of patients. Cerebellar tonsil displacement (P = 0.003), strain (P = 0.012), and maximum strain rate (P = 0.04) were reduced after surgery (n = 20). There was no statistically significant association between tissue motion and headache symptoms.
   CONCLUSION: The results of this study do not support a relationship between cardiac cycle cerebellar strain and Valsalva headache in patients with CM-1. It is possible that cerebellar strain related to respiratory maneuvers is associated with headache in Chiari patients. Further investigation of tissue strain is warranted because it represents a potential biomarker for outcomes after surgery.

AB BACKGROUND: Bevacizumab plus irinotecan is a new beneficial chemotherapy strategy for patients with malignant glioma. The purpose of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to comprehensively assess the risk of adverse vascular events in adults with malignant glioma treated with bevacizumab plus irinotecan.
   METHODS: The Cochrane Library, Embase and PubMed were searched, and relevant trials were identified up to June 2018. Two investigators screened all titles and abstracts for possible inclusion and extracted data independently. Six studies were included, and 5 of them in the control group using bevacizumab alone or bevacizumab with temozolomide. Three systems were used to assess the quality of evidence and the level of recommendation. The Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine Levels of Evidence (2009) system was used to classify the evidence into 5 levels (classes I-V). The star system from the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale was used to assess methodological quality. The GRADE profiler was used to evaluate the overall body of evidence.
   RESULTS: Our data show that bevacizumab plus irinotecan therapy does not significantly affect the risk of systemic adverse events (odds ratio [OR] 1.17; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.43-3.18). Patients treated with bevacizumab plus irinotecan had a similar risk of hematotoxicity (OR, 1.06; 95% CI, 0.26-4.38), thrombocytopenia (OR, 1.07; 95% CI, 0.25-4.63), and hypertension (OR, 1.34; 95% CI, 0.28-6.36) compared with the control group (those treated without irinotecan). Thrombosis occurred more frequently in patients treated with bevacizumab plus irinotecan compared with the control group (OR, 3.23; 95% CI, 1.47-7.12).
   CONCLUSIONS: The risk of systemic adverse events was not significantly different between patients with malignant glioma treated with bevacizumab plus irinotecan and the control group. The risks of hematotoxicity, thrombocytopenia, and hypertension were similar in the 2 groups. The risk of thrombosis was higher in patients treated with bevacizumab plus irinotecan. Monitoring for thrombosis and administering anticoagulant therapy as necessary merit promotion for patients with malignant glioma receiving treatment with bevacizumab plus irinotecan.

AB BACKGROUND: Vitamin D deficiency is a well-known cause of postoperative complications in patients undergoing orthopedic surgery. Orthopedic complications seen in vitamin D deficiency include nonunion, pseudarthrosis, and hardware failure. We seek to investigate the relationship between vitamin D deficiency and outcomes after lumbar spinal fusions.
   METHODS: A retrospective patient chart review was conducted at a single center for all patients who underwent lumbar spinal fusions from January 2015 to September 2017 with preoperative or postoperative vitamin D laboratory values. We recorded demographics, social history, medications, pre-existing medical conditions, bone density (dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry) T-scores, procedural details, 1-year postoperative Visual Analog Score (VAS), documented pseudarthrosis, revisions, and hardware failure. A total of 150 patients were initially included in the cohort for analysis.
   RESULTS: Overall, preoperative and postoperative vitamin D levels were not significantly associated with a vast majority of the patient characteristics studied, including comorbidities, medications, or surgical diagnoses (P> 0.05). Age at surgery was significantly associated with vitamin D levels; older patients had higher serum levels of vitamin D both preoperatively (P = 0.03) and postoperatively (P = 0.01). Those with a higher average body mass index had lower vitamin D in both groups (P = 0.02). Vitamin D levels were not significantly associated with rates of postoperative pseudarthrosis, revision, or hardware complications (P> 0.05). VAS pain score at 1 year and smoking status preoperatively or postoperatively were not associated with vitamin D levels (P> 0.05).
   CONCLUSIONS: Both preoperative and postoperative vitamin D levels were not significantly associated with an increased or decreased risk of pseudarthrosis, revision surgery, hardware failure, or 1-year VAS pain score after lumbar spine fusion surgery.

   SURGERY
AB BACKGROUND: Most meningiomas are classified as World Health Organization (WHO) grade I. Adjuvant radiation therapy (RT) is commonly recommended for subtotal resections with documented progressive regrowth of lesions with venous sinus involvement. We investigated if recurrence of WHO grade I meningiomas was influenced by adjuvant RT.
   METHODS: From 2000 to 2014, patients with grade I meningiomas with at least one venous sinus involvement and at least 4 years of follow-up were included. Demographics, venous sinus involvement, histology, and extent of resection (EOR) were characterized. Because patients undergoing RT tend to differ from those for whom adjuvant therapy was not prescribed, we used propensity scores to adjust for confounding variables.
   RESULTS: Sixty-two patients were included; of these, 18 (29.0%) had recurrences. The mean age was 52.8 +/- 12.3 years, and 79.0% were women. A total of 34 cases (54.8%) were submitted to adjuvant RT. Adjuvant RT was more frequent in those who had tumor recurrence (77.8% vs. 45.5%, P = 0.020). RT was more frequent in superior sagittal sinus (SSS) invasion (76.5% vs. 50.0%, P = 0.030) and less prevalent after gross total resection (GTR) (32.4% vs. 67.9%, P = 0.005). Propensity score adjusted analysis suggested no adjuvant RT benefit (odds ratio [OR], 2.51; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.68-9.28; P = 0.167), independent of the EOR. SSS involvement increased recurrence risk (OR, 12.69; 95% CI, 1.46-110.27; P = 0.021), whereas GTR tended to decrease it (OR, 0.26; 95% CI, 0.06-1.09; P = 0.065).
   CONCLUSIONS: Adjuvant RT does not seem to be a pivotal criterion to reduce the recurrence rate in patients with grade I meningioma, even when venous sinuses are involved.

AB BACKGROUND: Dysphagia is one of the most common complications of anterior cervical spine surgery, and there is a need to establish that the means of testing for it are reliable and valid. The objective of this study was to measure observer variability of the fiberoptic endoscopic evaluation of swallowing (FEES) test, specifically when used for evaluation of dysphagia in patients undergoing revisionary anterior cervical decompression and fusion (ACDF).
   METHODS: Images from patients undergoing revision ACDF at a single institution were collected from May 1, 2010, through July 1, 2014. Two senior certified speech pathologists independently evaluated the swallowing function of patients preoperatively and at 2 weeks postoperatively. Their numeric evaluations of the Rosenbeck Penetration-Aspiration Scale and the Swallowing Performance Scale during the FEES were then compared for interrater reliability.
   RESULTS: Positive agreement between raters was 94% for the preoperative Penetration-Aspiration Scale (prevalence-adjusted bias-adjusted kappa, 0.77). The postoperative Penetration-Aspiration Scale showed reliability coefficients for kappa, Kendall's W, and intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) of 0.34 (fair agreement), 0.70 (extremely strong agreement), and 0.35 (poor agreement), respectively. The preoperative Swallowing Performance Scale showed strong agreement, with a Kendall's W coefficient of 0.68, and fair reliability, with an ICC of 0.40. The postoperative Swallowing Performance Scale indicated extremely strong agreement between raters, with a Kendall's W of 0.82, and good agreement, with an ICC of 0.53.
   CONCLUSIONS: The FEES test appears to be a reliable assessor of dysphagia in patients undergoing ACDF and may be a useful measure for exploring outcomes in this population.

AB OBJECTIVE: To determine whether cranial metrics consistently differed between patients with moyamoya and age-, sex-, and race-matched controls.
   METHODS: Patients diagnosed with moyamoya disease by cerebral angiogram were obtained from a prospectively collected database through the Department of Neurosurgery at the University of Kansas Medical Center. Control patients matched by decade of age, sex, and race were collected through a deidentified hospital database by International Classification of Diseases-9 and 10 codes for ischemic stroke to identify patients with computed tomography angiograms. Imaging studies for both groups were analyzed to obtain 6 skull metrics: maximum anterior to posterior distance, maximum biparietal distance, bregma to occiput distance, right carotid canal diameter (CCD), left CCD, and cephalic index.
   RESULTS: Forty-five patients were identified in each cohort. Measurements of mean anterior to posterior skull diameter, mean biparietal skull diameter, bregma to occiput distances, and calculated cephalic index did not demonstrate a statistically significant difference between patients with moyamoya and control patients. Right carotid canal mean diameter was 4.8 mm for the moyamoya group and 5.4 mm for the control group, with a significant raw mean difference of -0.61 mm (95% confidence interval, -0.95 to -0.27). Left CCD was 4.7 mm for the moyamoya group and 5.5 mm for the control group, resulting in a significant raw mean difference of -0.76 mm (95% confidence interval, -1.09 to -0.43).
   CONCLUSIONS: This study identified 2 skull parameters as statistically different in patients with moyamoya compared with a matched control group of patients with ischemic stroke: right CCD and left CCD.

AB INTRODUCTION: Analysis of safety and effectiveness of stent angioplasty for failure of thrombectomy in patients with acute intracranial atherosclerotic occlusion.
   METHODS: Retrospective continuous analysis of the clinical data of 458 patients with acute stroke undergoing endovascular artery thrombectomy in Changhai Hospital of Second Military Medical University from May 2013 to February 2018. Patients with acute intracranial atherosclerotic occlusion treating with stent implantation were included and the safety and effectiveness of stent angioplasty was evaluated.
   RESULTS: There was successful stent release in 55 patients. There were 36 cases (65.5%) with occlusion located in the anterior circulation and 19 cases (34.5%) in the posterior circulation. Twenty patients underwent intravenous thrombolysis before surgery, and the time of admission to intravenous thrombolysis was (39.9 +/- 13.2) minutes. Fifty-four patients (98.2%) achieved modified thrombolysis in cerebral infarction 2b-3 recanalization. The National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score 2.0 (0.0,6.0) 7 days after surgery was significantly improved compared with the preoperative National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score 12.5 (6.0-20.0) (Z = -4.073, P < 0.05). Intracranial hemorrhage occurred in 7 patients (12.7%) after surgery, among them, symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage occurred in 2 cases (3.6%). CTP examination of the skull 3-5 days after operation showed: Among 39 cases (70.9%): 33 cases (84.6%) were patency, 4 cases (10.3%) were occlusion, 2 cases (5.1%) were moderate stenosis, and 16 cases (29.1%) were not examined by computed tomography perfusion. Ninety-day follow-up showed that a total of 43 cases were followed up, and 12 cases were lost to followup. Thirty-four patients (79.1%) had a good prognosis 90 days after surgery (modified Rankin scale score 0-2) and 9 patients died (20.9%).
   CONCLUSION: When thrombectomy in patients with acute intracranial atherosclerotic occlusion fails, stent angioplasty is safe and effective; however, short-term stent reocclusion after surgery cannot be ignored. Because of the small sample size, larger multicenter clinical studies are needed to confirm this result.

AB BACKGROUND: Interleaving stimulation (ILS) is a stim-ulation strategy that can help the physician manage more challenging cases of patients with deep brain stimulation (DBS) for Parkinson disease (PD). It consists of altering 2 different programs on the electrode with the same frequency.
   OBJECTIVES: Our objective was to overview our patients experience with ILS and explore clinical scenarios in which ILS should be considered when programming DBS in patients with PD.
   METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed medical charts from 120 patients with PD treated with DBS between 2011 and 2018.
   RESULTS: Eighteen patients received ILS. One was excluded because of the medical chart was incomplete. The remaining 17 patients had subthalamic nucleus DBS (n = 14) and globus pallidus internus DBS (n = 3). Eight patients (47%) received ILS to improve rigidity and bradykinesia, 4 to improve dyskinesias, 4 because of refractory tremor, and 1 for gait management. Until the end of data collection, 13 of 17 patients (70%) were still on ILS, with a mean duration time of 28.8 months (range, 2-44 months) Four patients reported no benefit from ILS and had their program changed.
   CONCLUSIONS: Overall, ILS is useful 1) to use 2 contacts optimally improve 2 specific symptoms but have different therapeutic windows; 2) to avoid side effects related to current spreading to nearby areas; 3) to increase frequency in a small region; or 4) to stimulate a larger target area.

AB OBJECTIVE: Recently, microRNAs (miRs) have been reported to be novel regulators in ischemic stroke. In this study, we investigated the pattern of miR-451 expression along with its clinical application in human ischemic stroke and in an in vivo mouse model.
   METHODS: The level of miR-451 was evaluated in patients and mice after ischemic stroke. National Institute of Health Stroke Scale scores and brain infarct volume were analyzed to the correlation of miR-451 expression and clinical information. In addition, blood samples and brain tissues were collected from an established middle cerebral artery occlusion model consisting of 12 adult male mice at 24 hours after the middle cerebral artery occlusion.
   RESULTS: The results showed that miR-451 levels in the circulating blood of ischemic stroke patients were greatly decreased compared with the control. Further correlation analysis revealed a negative association between miR-451 and National Institute of Health Stroke Scale scores (r = -0.6104, P < 0.001) and infarct volume (r = -0.5442, P < 0.001). Moreover, miR-451 was downregulated in response to middle cerebral artery occlusion in vivo, along with a negative correlation between miR-451 in brain and blood (r = 0.9240, P < 0.01). In addition, forced expression of miR-451 weakened ischemic brain infarction and apoptosis levels in focal ischemia-stroked mice, while downregulation of miR-451 significantly augmented ischemic injury.
   CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, miR-451 displays the neuroprotective effect in ischemic stroke and might serve as a novel therapeutic target of ischemic stroke.

AB BACKGROUND: Xanthogranuloma is a chronic inflammatory mass characterized by cholesterol crystal deposition, which is rarely seen in the sellar region. The objective of this study is to identify the clinical features and cause of sellar xanthogranulomas.
   METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed manifestation, radiographic, and endocrinologic presentation in 9 patients (7 women and 2 men) whom we had previously treated.
   RESULTS: The patients were between 26 and 73 years of age (median, 56 years). The chief symptoms were visual symptoms in 3, polyuria in 3, headache in 4, and tiredness in 4 patients. Perimetry found visual field deficit in 6 patients. Anterior pituitary provocation tests disclosed impairment of >= 1 hormone in all patients: growth hormone in 8 patients and adrenocorticotropic hormone-cortisol axis in 8 patients. The lesions were suprasellar in 2 patients, intrasellar in 2 patients, and intrasuprasellar region in 5 patients. Three of the lesions were solid and 6 were single cystic to multicystic. Very low intensity area on T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging was observed in 4 lesions. Postcontrast study performed in 7 lesions showed enhancement in solid parts or cyst walls. Surgical decompression improved visual disturbance in half of the patients but rarely improved hormonal deficits. Follow-up (median, 47 months) found no recurrence of the lesion. In addition to these 9 cases, we found 2 xanthogranulomatous lesions pathologically associated with ciliated epithelia, which also presented with severe hypopituitarism.
   CONCLUSIONS: Xanthogranuloma seems to be the last stage of the chronic inflammation affecting Rathke cleft cyst or craniopharyngioma presenting with severe anterior pituitary insufficiency.

AB BACKGROUND: Anterior column realignment (ACR) was developed as a minimally invasive method for treating sagittal imbalance. However, rod fracture (RF) rates associated with ACR are not known. Our objective was to assess the rate of and risk factors for RF following ACR in deformity correction surgery.
   METHODS: We conducted a retrospective multicenter review of patients with adult spinal deformity (ASD) who underwent ACR for deformity correction. ASD was defined as coronal Cobb angle >= 20 degrees, pelvic incidence-lumbar lordosis >10 degrees, sagittal vertical axis >= 5 cm, pelvic tilt >= 25 degrees, or thoracic kyphosis . Inclusion criteria were ASD, age >18 years, use of ACR, and development of RF or full radiographs obtained at least 1 year after surgery that did not demonstrate RF.
   RESULTS: Ninety patients were identified, with mean follow-up of 2.3 +/- 1.4 years (age, 64.1 +/- 9.4; 54 [60%] women). The most common ACR location was L3/4 (42 cases; 47%). Mean fusion length was 7.5 +/- 3.6 levels. Four (4.4%) of 90 patients developed RF within 12 months of surgery. RF occurred adjacent to ACR in all cases; RF was not associated with focal correction (P = 0.49), rod material (P = 0.8), degree of correction (P> 0.07), or interbody at L5/S1 (P = 0.06). RF was associated with longer fusion constructs in univariate (P = 0.002) and multivariate (P = 0.03) analyses.
   CONCLUSIONS: RF occurred in 4.4% of patients with ASD who underwent ACR with a minimum of 1-year follow-up. RF was not associated with focal correction but appears to be associated with global correction and extent of fixation.

AB BACKGROUND: The short-term neurologic outcome of infants undergoing brain tumor surgery depends on various perioperative factors. This study was undertaken to analyze the effects of perioperative variables on the postoperative neurologic outcome in infants undergoing brain tumor surgery.
   METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the chart of infants undergoing craniotomy for brain tumor removal from 2000 to 2017. The data related to preoperative variables, intraoperative management details, and postoperative factors were collected and analyzed. The primary outcome measure was occurrence of new postoperative neurologic deficit (POND) and the secondary outcome measure was length of hospital stay (LOHS).
   RESULTS: Complete data were available for 40 infants undergoing craniotomy for excision of intracranial tumor. New-onset POND was found in 14 infants (35%). Based on logistic regression analysis, POND was associated with use of mannitol and massive blood transfusion (MBT) trended toward significance. Based on linear regression analysis, the risk factor associated with prolonged LOHS was reintubation and POND trended toward significance.
   CONCLUSIONS: In this study, factors associated with new POND were mannitol use and to a certain extent MBT. The variables associated with prolonged LOHS were reintubation and to a certain extent POND. The anesthetic technique, location of tumor, tumor histology, and extent of tumor resection did not influence the occurrence of new POND or prolonged LOHS in infantile intracranial tumor surgery. Further prospective studies with larger samples are required for confirmation of these findings and identification of new perioperative risk factors.

ID CEREBRAL ANEURYSMS; MULTICENTER; COMPLICATIONS
AB BACKGROUND: Flow-diverting stents have revolutionized the endovascular treatment of intracranial aneurysms. The purpose of this study is to identify predictors of adverse outcomes associated with the pipeline embolization device (PED).
   METHODS: A retrospective analysis of all patients treated with PED at a single high-volume center from January 2014 to September 2018. Patient outcomes, neurologic morbidity/mortality, and other clinical variables were analyzed.
   RESULTS: We treated 204 aneurysms in 170 patients with PED. Mean length of follow-up was 11 months. Most (181) aneurysms (89%) were located in the anterior circulation, and 23 (11%) were found in the posterior circulation. Most aneurysms were saccular (82%), followed by fusiform (11%), blister (4%), and dissecting pseudoaneurysms (3%). Mean aneurysm size was 8.2 + 5.7 mm with 145 (71%) small aneurysms (<= 10 mm), 53 (26%) large aneurysms (between 10 and 25 mm), and 6 (3%) giant aneurysms (>= 25 mm). Ninety-two percent of aneurysms were unruptured, and 8% were ruptured. The overall major neurologic morbidity/mortality was 4.7% and 1.8%, respectively. The all-cause mortality was 2.9%. Predictors of neurologic morbidity/mortality included the baseline modified Rankin Scale (P = 0.001), aneurysm neck size (P = 0.003), aneurysm size (P = 0.006), anterior versus posterior location (P = 0.02), and rupture at presentation (0.006). The P2Y12 Reactivity Unit, parent vessel diameter, and patient age did not correlate with adverse events.
   CONCLUSIONS: The PED has a satisfactory safety profile in both on- and off-label indications. A poor clinical patient baseline, wider aneurysm neck or larger size, and rupture predict an increased risk of an unfavorable outcome.

AB OBJECTIVE: Thyrotropin (TSH)-secreting pituitary tumors are rare and typically present with hyperthyroidism. Here we report the diagnosis, treatment, and surgical outcomes in a series of patients with TSH-secreting pituitary tumors in a tertiary referral center.
   METHODS: Descriptive retrospective study that included all patients with TSH-secreting pituitary tumors who underwent transsphenoidal surgery in the endocrinology and nutrition unit of the Virgen del Rocio University Hospital (Seville, Spain) between 2004 and 2016.
   RESULTS: The mean age at diagnosis was 42.8 +/- 17 years. The mean time from onset of symptoms to diagnosis was 13 +/- 10 months. Four patients displayed symptoms indicating hyperthyroidism (1 suffered from tachycardia); 3 patients showed symptoms because of mass effect (visual impairment and headache) and 3 patients were diagnosed based on incidental findings after routine blood tests (high free thyroxine levels). Eight patients had macroadenomas, and 2 patients had microadenomas. Five patients underwent conventional pituitary surgery, and 5 patients underwent expanded endoscopic transsphenoidal surgery. Six patients achieved cure after surgery. The other patients received radiotherapy and/or treatment with somatostatin analogs. Analysis of somatostatin receptor (SSTR) expression by immunohistochemistry could be performed in 6 tumors.
   CONCLUSIONS: Our results confirm the clinical and hormonal heterogeneity caused by TSH-secreting pituitary adenomas. Surgery is considered the first choice of treatment for these tumors. We observed surgical cure rates similar to those reported in recent published series. SSTR2 and SSTR3 are highly expressed in TSH-secreting pituitary adenomas. Our results suggest that somatostatin analog treatment may be also helpful in the treatment of TSH-secreting pituitary adenomas.

DE Aspiration; Catheter; Stroke; Thrombectomy
AB INTRODUCTION: Three new 0.071-inch and 0.072-inch aspiration catheters have been introduced for stroke thrombectomy. Their comparative efficacy has not been clinically evaluated.
   METHODS: We reviewed a prospectively maintained thrombectomy database for cases using 1 of these 3 catheters for proximal large vessel occlusion from September 2018 to February 2019. Clinical and angiographic information was extracted.
   RESULTS: Of 145 thrombectomies performed over the time period, 49 utilized 1 of the 3 new large-bore catheters (React 71, n = 21; Vecta 71, n = 19; Jet 7, n = 9) on the first pass. Mean patient age was 73 years (SD: 15). Mean presenting National Institute of Health Stroke Scale score was 19 (SD: 6, range: 5-33). Clot location was middle cerebral artery first segment in 59% of cases, internal carotid artery in 31%, and basilar in 10%. With or without a stentriever, clot access with the initially selected aspiration catheter was achieved in 47 of 49 (96%) cases. Excluding empiric stentriever usage, the aspiration catheter could be delivered to the clot without needing a stentriever in 87% of cases: 100% with React 71, 93% with Vecta 71, and 43% with Jet 7 (P = 0.002). Final Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction score 2b/3 was achieved in 92% of cases overall: 95% with React 71, 89% with Jet 7, and 89% with Vecta 71. Median procedure time was 28 minutes; mean total number of passes was 2.4 (SD: 1.6) with 39% of cases being single-pass cases. These rates did not significantly differ between aspiration catheters.
   CONCLUSIONS: In comparing the newest large bore aspiration catheters, similar angiographic efficacy is achieved.

AB OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the relationship between degenerative lumbar spondylolisthesis (DLS) and the L4 inclination angle (IA) and evaluate the risk factors of DLS.
   METHODS: Ninety patients with L4- L5 DLS and 90 with L4- L5 lumbar disc herniation or spinal stenosis (control group) were compared. Parameters including L4 IA, facet joint angle (FJA), cross-sectional area of paraspinal muscle, Pfirrmann grading of intervertebral disc, and degeneration grading of facet joint (FJ) were evaluated. The Student t tests and logistic regression analysis were used to analyze the risk factors of DLS.
   RESULTS: Statistical differences were found in L4 IA, -ass-sectional area of multifidus muscle, FJA, and degeneration grading of FJ between 2 groups (P < 0.001, P = 0.07, P < 0.001, and P < 0.001, respectively). The logistic regression analysis demonstrated that greater L4 IA (beta: -0.186, P < 0.001), more sagittal FJ (beta: -0.117, P < 0.001), and more severe degeneration of FJ (beta: -1.033, P < 0.001) were both significant predictors of DLS.
   CONCLUSIONS: Patients with L4 IA greater than 11.15 degrees greater than 60.19 degrees are more likely to occur DLS.

AB OBJECTIVE: To study clinical significance of augmentation of intraoperative motor evoked potentials (MVPs) during direct open surgery for middle cerebral artery (MCA) aneurysms.
   METHODS: Between 2009 and 2017, 134 MCA aneurysm surgeries were performed with intraoperative MEP monitoring. The frequency and cause of augmentation with >50% increase of MEP amplitude from baseline were studied. Factors associated with MEP augmentation were investigated.
   RESULTS: MEP augmentation was demonstrated in 9 patients. All 9 events were observed just after application of the temporary clip to the parent artery. The ratio of the maximum amplitude to baseline was 2.6 +/- 1.1 at an mean of 2.4 +/- 1.1 minutes after parent artery occlusion. Ten patients who did not show MEP augmentation after parent artery occlusion were compared with the patients showing MEP augmentation. The distance of the temporary clip point from the midline was smaller in patients with MEP augmentation compared with patients without MEP augmentation (P = 0.033).
   CONCLUSIONS: MEP augmentation was thought to be an early ischumic sign preceding a significant decrease in MEPs during MCA aneurysm surgery. Transient augmentation of MEPs was more frequently observed in cases with a temporary clip applied to the more proximal part of the MCA.

AB OBJECTIVE: To determine the effect of vitamin D supplementation on postoperative pain and analgesic requirement in brain tumor surgery.
   METHODS: A total of 60 patients with vitamin D serum levels <= 20 ng/dL were randomly assigned to 2 groups equally. The study group (n = 30) received intramuscular injection of 300,000 IU vitamin D before surgery.
   RESULTS: Preoperative serum level of vitamin D was 15.9 +/- ng/dL and 14.5 +/- 3.6 ng/dL in the study and control groups, respectively (P = 0.13). Serum level of vitamin D on day 5 of surgery was 22.5 +/- 4.3 and 13.7 +/- 3.8 in the study and control groups, respectively (P < 0.001). A percentage of 50% had pain scores >4 on the first postoperative day, which decreased with time. The median (interquartile range) of the visual analogue scale score during the 3 postoperative days was 3(5), 3(5), 1(3), and 5(7), 2(5), 1(3) in the study and control groups, respectively, with no significant difference. There was no difference in analgesic consumption between the 2 groups. Analysis through the generalized estimating equation model indicated that patients who had received vitamin D for a longer time before the operative time had an insignificantly less pain score.
   CONCLUSIONS: On the basis of the study results, one of our patients reported moderate-to-severe pain scores on the first day after surgery. The pain in the study group was insignificantly less than that in the control group, but it seems that chronic high level of vitamin D may lead to promising results.

AB OBJECTIVE: To investigate the characteristics of materials used as prostheses for microvascular decompression surgery (MVDs) in Japan and their possible adverse events (AEs) to determine preferable materials for MVDs.
   METHODS: A questionnaire was sent to all members of the Japanese Society for MVDs, and answers were obtained from 59 institutions.
   RESULTS: Among a total of 2789 MVDs, 1088 operations for trigeminal neuralgia, 1670 for hemifacial spasm, and 31 others, including 117 reoperations, were performed between April 2011 and March 2014. Nonabsorbable material was used in 96.5% of MVDs, including polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) (80.5%), polyurethane (11.9%), expanded PTFE (21%), and silk thread (t47%). The use of absorbable materials, including fibrin glue (87.5%), cellulose (13.5%), gelatin (4,77%), and collagen (136%), was reported. The major combinations were PTFE with fibrin glue (58.7%) followed by PTFE alone (7.60%). Eighty-eight AEs in 85 (32%) cases were reported among 2672 first operations. AEs included 51 central nervous system dysfunctions, 15 wound infections/dehiscence, and 10 others, which were presumed to be related to the intraoperative procedure. Among relatively high-, moderate-, and low-volume centers, there were no significant differences in the frequency of AEs (P = 0.077). Tissue-prosthesis adhesion and/or granuloma formation were reported in 13 cases of 117 reoperations. The incidence of adhesion-related recurrence was 11.1% of all reoperations.
   CONCLUSIONS: The number of AEs was quite low in this survey, and intradural use of any prosthesis reported in this paper might be justified; however, further development of easily handled and less-adhesive prosthesis materials is awaited.

AB OBJECTIVE: To investigate the influence of modified clivoaxial angle (MCAA) on the surgical planning and outcome in adult patients with Chiari malformation type I.
   METHODS: Clinical data of 268 adult patients undergoing posterior fossa decompression without (PFD) or with duraplasty (PFDD) or with resection of tonsils (RT) for Chiari malformation type I over 10 years were reviewed retrospectively, with outcome evaluated by Chicago Chiari Outcome Scale (CCOS) score. By means of receiver operating characteristic curve, the threshold of MCAA was calculated to stratify the patients.
   RESULTS: MCAA was positively correlated with CCOS score. In the MCAA <= 127 degrees group (n = 57) with severe ventral cervicomedullary compression (VCMC), CCOS score of PFD, PFDD, and RT was 11.00, 11.06, and 12.42 (P < 0.05), respectively. In the 127 degrees < MCAA <= 138 degrees group (n = 87) with moderate VCMC, CCOS score of PFD, PFDD, and RT was 11.71, 12.72, and 13.00 (P < 0.01), respectively. In the MCAA > 138 degrees group (n = 124) with mild or no VCMC, CCOS score of PFD, PFDD, and RT was 13.19, 13.90, and 13.67 (P < 0.05), respectively. The mean MCAA increased by 4.4 degrees postoperatively (P < 0.05), which was positively associated with syringomyelia shrinkage.
   CONCLUSIONS: MCAA may play a role in guiding the surgical treatment and predicting the prognosis in adult CMI patients. The larger the MCAA, the less invasive surgery is preferred with higher CCOS. PFDD should be the first choice in patients with mild or no VCMC (MCAA >138 degrees) and RT in patients with moderate VCMC (127 < MCAA <= 138 degrees). For patients with severe VCMC (MCAA <= 127 degrees), RT could be considered as the primary surgery with awareness of the possible insufficiency of posterior decompression alone.

AB BACKGROUND: Undesirable events in the neurosurgery operating theater have less often been the result of a technical error than of a dysfunction linked to nontechnical skills (NTSs). The essential aim of our study was to perform a systematic review of the reported data on NTS in neurosurgery. Our secondary objective was to identify the NTSs more specific to neurosurgery to define the training needs of neurosurgery trainees.
   METHODS: The MEDLINE and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews were searched according to the PRISMA (preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analysis) guidelines. The search initially identified 2132 reports, of which 21 were eligible for systematic study. Data were extracted from the report regarding study design, sample size, NTSs assessed, and assessment tools, and the key results were collected.
   RESULTS: Interpersonal skills (communication, teamwork), cognitive skills (decision making, situational awareness), and personal resource factors (coping with stress or fatigue) were specifically identified. No study had used assessment tools such as NOTECHS (nontechnical skills), NOTSS (nontechnical skills for surgeons), or OTAS (observational teamwork assessment for surgery). They were performed in a real environment in 11 cases, in a simulated environment in 9, and during theoretical teaching in 1 case.
   CONCLUSIONS: Very few studies have been performed concerning neurosurgical NTSs, despite the increasing the number of studies during the past few years on NTSs in other domains of surgery. Society has been concentrating more and more on the quality and safety of medical care. The development and application of NTS assessment tools is, therefore, essential to provide assistance in the training of future neurosurgeons.

AB INTRODUCTION: Genome-wide association studies have reported an association between the EDNRA gene and intracranial aneurysm (IA) in European and Japanese populations; however, there is no study on this polymorphism in other Asian populations. Therefore, we performed an extensive large-scale meta-analysis for association of the rs6841581 variant of EDNRA with IA susceptibility in East Asian population.
   METHODS: We conducted a systemic review via electronic search for papers published between January 2002 and February 2019. We used fixed and random effect models and applied the inverse variance method. The statistical power of the result was estimated in the genome-wide significant threshold under an additive inheritance model.
   RESULTS: Our meta-analysis included 5873 patients with IA and 14,736 non-IA controls from 6 independent populations: 4 Japanese, 1 Chinese, and 1 Korean. The risk (major) G allele of rs6841581 showed the highest significant association with the increased risk of IA under the fixed effect model in the East-Asian population (odds ratio = 1.244, 95% confidence interval: 1,174-1.318, P = 1.36E-13). The rs6841581 variant showed sufficient statistical power (80.3%) in this meta-analysis under the additive model. In subsequent analysis, the frequencies of the risk G allele showed similar pattern in all of the Japanese, Chinese, and Korean populations (69%, 80%, and 78%, respectively). In the in silico functional analysis, none of the functional variants was correlated with rs6841581.
   CONCLUSIONS: The genetic variant of EDNRA, rs6841581, was significantly associated with increased risk of IA. Our findings indicate that it could be used as an IA-predicting variant in East Asian populations.

AB BACKGROUND: The transfemoral approach is a common technique for carotid artery stenting (CAS) but is sometimes limited by aortic or peripheral arterial conditions. The purpose of this study is to report the initial experiences with CAS using a novel sheath guide for transradial carotid cannulation.
   METHODS: A sheath guide designed specifically for transradial carotid cannulation was developed. The transradial approach for CAS was started in April 2016, and data were collected prospectively. Patients who underwent transradial elective CAS from April 2016 to June 2018 were included in the analysis. Every CAS procedure was started through the right radial route with a 6-French (internal diameter) sheath guide specifically designed for the radial approach under local anesthesia. Technical success, periprocedural complications, and 30-day major vascular events (stroke, myocardial infarction, and/or death) were investigated.
   RESULTS: Twenty-six patients underwent transradial CAS. Procedures performed via the radial route were successful in every case. A periprocedural complication (transient ischemic attack after CAS) occurred in 1 patient. The patient returned to the preoperative state within a few days and had no neurologic deficits. No access site-related complications occurred. Patients who underwent transradial CAS could walk immediately after CAS, even during hemostasis. No major cardiovascular events occurred within 30 days after CAS.
   CONCLUSIONS: The herein-described sheath guide specifically designed for transradial carotid cannulation was useful for CAS.

AB OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to discuss the relationship between Ki-67 values and the degree to which chordoma invade the clivus and to certify that the prognosis of chordoma is worse when it invades the middle and lower clivus than when it does not.
   METHODS: We collected 56 cases of first-time chordoma illness in which patients received no treatment before surgery. Patients underwent craniocerebral magnetic resonance imaging and skull-base 3-dimensional computed tomography scans before the operation. We divided patients into 2 groups depending on the extent to which the middle and lower clivus were invaded. We classified patients with chordoma that did not significantly invade the middle and lower clivuses into a noninvasive" group and the others into an "invasive" group. Ki-67 values were extracted from the pathological report after surgery. We use an independent chi(2) test to indicate that Ki-67 values for the invasive group were higher than those for the noninvasive group.
   RESULTS: We grouped the data and did a statistical analysis. We found that the Ki-67 values are >5% for most patients in whom chordoma have eroded the middle-lower clivus, whereas it is <= 5% for patients in whom the middle-lower clivus region has not been invaded. Therefore, there is a correlation between Ki-67 value and the region of chordoma invading the clivus.
   CONCLUSIONS: Statistical analysis revealed that Ki-67 values when the chordoma invaded the middle and lower clivus were significantly higher than when it did not. Thus, we can conclude that the prognosis is worse when chordoma invade the middle and lower clivus.

AB OBJECTIVE: To identify the domains of recovery, as determined by the Quality of Recovery-15 (QoR-15) score, that needed improvement to develop initial interventions for an enhanced recovery after surgery protocol for patients undergoing elective intracranial surgery under general anesthesia.
   METHODS: A paired-availability design was used to assess 2 groups of 41 patients undergoing elective intracranial surgery. The baseline QoR-15 score and scores 0, 6, 12, and 24 hours after arrival in the intensive care unit characterized the postoperative recovery trajectory. The lowest scoring domains of the QoR-15 score were identified in the preimplementation group, and pharmacologic interventions were initiated in the postimplementation group.
   RESULTS: Postoperative analgesia and postoperative nausea and vomiting were identified as the lowest scoring domains. The pharmacologic interventions implemented were chosen because they produced minimal sedation and were easy to administer-1 40-mg oral preoperative dose of aprepitant to target postoperative nausea and vomiting and 2 perioperative 1-g doses of intravenous acetaminophen to improve analgesia. We observed a clinically significant as well as statistically significant improvement in analgesia on arrival in the intensive care unit and at the 6-hour postoperative time point. The total QoR-15 score was improved through the 12-hour time point.
   CONCLUSIONS: In this quality improvement project, the QoR-15 score allowed us to identify domains that slowed the recovery course in this patient population. Two 1-g doses of intravenous acetaminophen improved patients' well-being and analgesia after elective intracranial surgery.

AB BACKGROUND: We are inevitably faced with the need to perform coil embolization immediately after diagnostic cerebral digital subtraction angiography (DSA) for economic reasons, patient convenience, fear of rupture, and other reasons. Here we report the advantages of coil embolization performed immediately after diagnostic cerebral DSA for unruptured intracranial aneurysms (UIAs) from the patients' perspective.
   METHODS: Between January 2017 and October 2018, 145 patients were treated for UIAs with endovascular coil embolization at the Yeungnam University Medical Center. There were 87 patients in the group in which coil embolization was to be performed at least 1 week after diagnostic cerebral DSA (regular [R] group) and 58 patients in the group in which coil embolization was to be performed immediately after diagnostic cerebral DSA (immediate [I] group).
   RESULTS: There were no statistically significant between group differences in any factor analyzed expect for medical expenses (out-of-pocket costs), 2,218,416 KRW (1963 USD) for the R group and 1,128,906 KRW (999 USD) for the I group (P < 0.001). There were no statistically significant differences in the rate of complications between the 2 groups, with 4 minor complications and 1 death in the R group and 3 minor complications and 1 death in the I group.
   CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that coil embolization performed immediately after diagnostic cerebral DSA can be a relatively safe alternative approach to treating patients with UIAs.

AB OBJECTIVE: Patient blood management (PBM) is defined as treatment of a patient who is at risk of transfusion to minimize the need for transfusion and improve the probability of an optimal clinical outcome. We performed the present study to examine the effects of PBM in spinal fusion surgery.
   METHODS: A total of 154 patients who had undergone 1-and 2-level posterior lumbar interbody fusion for degenerative lumbar disease were included. We retrospectively reviewed the data from 101 patients from 2012 to 2016 as the pre-PBM group. We recruited 53 patients from 2017 to 2018 for the post-PBM group. Intravenous iron was administered 2-4 weeks before surgery, and intravenous tranexamic acid was administered intraoperatively in the post-PBM group. The primary outcome was the reduction of hemoglobin (Fib). The secondary outcomes included perioperative blood loss, Hemovac drain output, postoperative transfusion, complications, and length of hospital stay.
   RESULTS: Intravenous iron was administered 17.4 days before surgery in the post-PBM group. The reduction in Fib was not significantly different statistically between the 2 groups (3.06 vs. 3.33 g/dL; P > 0.05). Of the 101 patients in the pre-PBM group, 24 (24%) underwent transfusion. In contrast, no patient in the post-PBM group had required a transfusion (P < 0.001). The average hospital stay was 10.15 days in the pre-PBM group and 8.33 days in the post-PBM group (P = 0.02). The average operative time was 146 minutes in the pre-PBM group and 133 minutes in the post-PBM group (P = 0.03). The Fib decrease and total Hemovac drain output did not differ significantly between the 2 groups.
   CONCLUSIONS: Implementation of PBM is an effective strategy for reducing the rate of transfusion in patients undergoing lumbar spinal fusion surgery without significant complications.

ID PRESTIGE; VALUES; LIFE
AB BACKGROUND: Textual analysis of obituaries provides insight into the shared values of a profession or community. Neurosurgeon obituaries are frequently published in both the medical literature and the lay press, but the content of these works has never been analyzed.
   METHODS: Using obituary pieces from Neurosurgery, Journal of Neurosurgery, and the New York Times, frequent terms were quantified through preliminary text analysis to derive the relative importance of concepts such as innovation, research, training and family. The sentiment of these obituaries was qualitatively reviewed to approximate perceptions of neurosurgical legacy within the profession and the general public.
   RESULTS: Thirty relevant obituaries with full text available were identified in the Journal of Neurosurgery, 14 were identified in Neurosurgery, and 23 were identified in the New York Times. Both neurosurgical journals and lay press articles relied on linear narratives, with greater emphasis on professional leadership and residency training in neurosurgical journals and proportionally greater mention of family in the lay press.
   CONCLUSIONS: Our preliminary text analysis of neurosurgeon obituaries suggest what values are shared among the professional community and general public regarding the legacy of a neurosurgeon.

ID PRACTICE MANAGEMENT EDUCATION; INFORMED-CONSENT; SURGERY; CURRICULUM
AB INTRODUCTION: Socioeconomic topics such as federal mandates/regulations, conflict of interest, and practice management have become increasingly important for all neurosurgeons. Graduating residents immediately need a host of skills to successfully navigate neurosurgical practice. Surgical and medical skills are closely evaluated through the American Board of Neurological Surgery, and a formal socioeconomic curriculum has been developed with defined milestones. Nevertheless, little has been done to evaluate neurosurgery resident competence in socioeconomic and medicolegal principles. The purpose of this study was to assess the competence of Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education neurosurgical residents in socioeconomic knowledge.
   METHODS: Neurosurgery resident members of the American Association of Neurological Surgeons (N = 1385) were sent a Survey Monkey of 10 questions. The survey covered the most basic of socioeconomic principles. Initial survey responses were collected across a 1-month period from April to May 2018.
   RESULTS: The response rate was 14% (194/1385). Overall, neurosurgery residents would have received a grade of D, with an average score of 67% on the survey. For 7 of the 10 questions, the majority (>50%) of neurosurgery residents answered correctly. Furthermore, for 3 questions, more than 90% of residents selected the correct answer. However, for one-half of all questions, residents averaged a score of less than 65%. Residents tended to answer questions correctly for physician compensation and compensation models, but incorrectly for topics of informed consent, Controlled Substances Act, and conflicts of interest.
   CONCLUSION: With the increasing complexity of neurosurgery practice, solid knowledge of socioeconomic topics is essential. The study confirms suspected deficiencies in socioeconomic proficiency among neurosurgery residents, despite the availability of a validated curriculum. This knowledge gap will likely affect career success and satisfaction. Nevertheless, this survey had a significantly low response rate, and it may be an incomplete representation of the neurosurgical resident mind. Focused educational initiatives through the neurosurgical Residency Review Committee and individual training programs must facilitate an action plan that ensures the effective implementation of socioeconomic curricula.

AB BACKGROUND: Delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI) is related to the major causes of morbidity and mortality in patients following subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH); however, little is known about the role of epigenetics in the pathogenesis of DCI. We investigated the specific DNA methylation profile that may affect the expression of inositol 1-,4-,5-trisphosphate receptor (ITPR3) responsible for cerebral vasospasm following SAH.
   METHODS: We prospectively studied patients with SAH between March 2015 and October 2018. The degree of methylation in the distal intergenic region (IGR) located on ITPR3 and gene expression were measured using methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction (MSP) and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). To investigate the regulatory mechanims of DNA hypermethylation, we further analyzed the mRNA expression of DNA methyltransferase (DNMT1) and ten-eleven translocation enzymes (TET1, TET2, and TET3).
   RESULTS: A total of 42 patients were included in our analysis. Patients with SAH and DCI had significantly higher levels of methylation intensity of distal IGR upstream of ITPR3 than those without DCI (median, 0.941 [interquartile range (IQR), 0.857-0.984] versus (0.670 [IQR, 0.543-0.761]; P < 0.001). In addition, patients with DCI showed decreased mRNA expression of ITPR3 compared with patients without DCI (median, 0.039 [IQR, 0.0300.045] vs. 0.047 [IQR, 0.038-0.064]; P = 0.0328). Patients with DCI had higher DNMT1 expression (P < 0.001) and lower TET1 expression (P = 0.040) than those without DCI; however, differences in TET2 and TET3 levels between the 2 groups were not statistically significant.
   CONCLUSIONS: Hypermethylation of the distal IGR located upstream of ITPR3 is related to greater DCI development in patients with SAH. Further studies of the precise mechanisms of methylation degree and DCI development using in vitro and in vivo models are needed.

TI Stereotactic Radiosurgery for Brainstem Cavernous Malformations: An
   Updated Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis

AB OBJECTIVE: This study was conducted to achieve more conclusive evidence for the efficacy of stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) for brainstem cavernous malformations (BSCMs).
   METHODS: A literature search of PubMed, EMBASE, and Web of Science was performed and studies reporting the outcomes of SRS for BSCMs were included. The primary outcome was the pre-SRS and post-SRS hemorrhage rates; the pooled incidence rate ratio (IRR) with 95% confidence interval was chosen as effect size. Lesion control, symptom change, and radiation-related complications were evaluated.
   RESULTS: A total of 576 patients across 14 studies were included in this meta-analysis. The post-SRS hemorrhage rate was significantly decreased compared with the pre-SRS rate (IRR, 0.123; P < 0.001), and the hemorrhage rate 2 years after SRS was significantly lower than that within 2 years after SRS (IRR, 0.317; P< 0.001). Ten among 14 studies have shown that the symptoms were improved or stationary after SRS. Lesion volume was reduced in 47.3% of the patients and was stationary in 49.4% on the last follow-up images. Symptomatic adverse radiation effects (AREs) developed in 7.3% and permanent AREs were observed in 2.2%. In subgroup analysis, studies having mean marginal dose of <= 13 Gy showed statistically significantly lower development of symptomatic AREs than those having mean marginal dose of >13Gy (2.0% vs. 10.8%; P = 0.008).
   CONCLUSIONS: SRS using a relatively low marginal dose can be a safe and effective treatment for BSCM. Further prospective studies are necessary to confirm the optimal radiation dose and efficacy of SRS for BSCMs.

AB BACKGROUND: Anterior cervical diskectomy and fusion(ACDF) is a standard surgical procedure used widely in the treatment of degenerative cervical spine conditions. Although the safety and effectiveness of single-level ACDF is well supported in the literature, reports of multilevel ACDF are sparse and present mixed results. There is concern for greater complications with increasing levels of fusion given the increased complexity, procedure duration, and invasiveness of multilevel ACDF.
   METHODS: In this retrospective review, we report complications data for 105 adult neurosurgical patients who underwent elective multilevel ACDF at a single institution by a single surgeon between 2004 and 2016.
   RESULTS: Fifty-four patients underwent 3-level ACDF Di patients underwent 4-level ACDF with a mean follow-up of 2.7 +/- 1.9 years. Although patients with 4-level fusion were more likely than those with 3-level fusion to have estimated blood loss >= 100 mL (P = 0.04), we found no significant differences in other peri- and postoperative complications, need for revision, and presence of symptoms at the time of last follow-up between groups.
   CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that 4-level ACDF is necessarily associated with a greater number of or more severe complications than 3-level ACDF.

AB OBJECTIVE: To determine whether presence of a honeanchored annular closure device (ACD) impacts reoperation strategies and subsequent outcomes.
   METHODS: Patients with large annular defects after single-level limited lumbar discectomy were randomly allocated to receive an ACD or discectomy alone (controls) and were followed for at least 3 years.
   RESULTS: Among 550 patients, reoperation risk was lower with ACD (11.0% vs. 19.3%). The types of reoperations and operative time were similar in each group, and the ACD did not interfere with surgical planning or operative technique. Fusion success was 87% with ACD versus 85% for controls. Perioperative complications occurred in 22% and 19% of reoperations, respectively. Leg pain and back function were improved with ACD versus controls after fusion procedures, and no group differences were observed after non-fusion reoperations.
   CONCLUSIONS: In patients undergoing post- discectomy reoperation, patients with an ACD were treated with similar operative techniques, were not exposed to additional surgical risks, and reported comparable clinical outcomes versus those without an ACD.

   FOLLOW-UP; BYPASS
AB BACKGROUND: Hie management of cavernous carotid aneurysms (CCAs) poses a significant dilemma to the treating surgeon. Asymptomatic CCAs usually are managed conservatively with clinical and radiologic follow-up. Large size, intradural extension, sphenoid bone erosion, and increasing size on follow-up are usual indications for treating asymptomatic CCAs. However, there are no clear-cut guidelines in literature. We share our experience of 40 asymptomatic CCAs treated by endovascular and surgical methods.
   METHODS: All the asymptomatic CCAs treated between January 2014 and December 2018 were analyzed retrospectively. Patient demographics, aneurysm characteristics, postprocedural complications, and clinical and radiologic follow-up data were obtained from records. Outcome was evaluated in terms of aneurysm obliteration and maintained cerebral perfusion, postoperative complications, recurrence, and clinically significant complications during follow-up.
   RESULTS: Endovascular coiling, balloon-assisted coiling, and stent-assisted coiling were performed in 27 (75%), 5 (13.9%), and 4 (11.1%), respectively. Raymond-Roy occlusion classification grade I occlusion was achieved in 88.9% of cases. No immediate or delayed complications were noted. Coil compaction was seen in 4 (11.1%) patients. In the surgery group, all patient underwent high-flow bypass with radial artery graft. Aneurysm exclusion with good graft patency was achieved in all 4 cases without any permanent morbidity or mortality.
   CONCLUSIONS: The current study demonstrates excellent outcomes of asymptomatic CCAs after treatment. In view of the technical advancements of both surgical and endovascular methods, consideration for treatment should be given to asymptomatic CCAs. Each aneurysm should be individually assessed by experts for choosing the best endovascular or surgical treatment option.

AB BACKGROUND: Risk factors for infection after vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) device implantation represent an important issue but remain unclear. We hypothesized that specific risk factors for infection would be associated with VNS device implantation. This study reviewed patients with epilepsy who underwent VNS device implantation and undertook a statistical analysis of risk factors for surgical site infection (SSI).
   METHODS: We reviewed all medical records for patients who underwent VNS therapy in our facility between August 2011 and May 2018. Age, sex, height, body weight, body mass index (BMI), intelligence quotient (IQ), surgical incision opening time, blood loss, epilepsy classification, activities of daily living, and generator replacement were statistically compared between cases with and without SSI.
   RESULTS: We performed 208 VNS device implantation surgeries at our facility during the study period. Among these, 150 patients underwent initial implantation, 56 patients underwent first generator replacement, and 2 patients underwent second replacement. Six patients (2.7%) with initial implantation and 3 patients (5.4%) with first replacement showed SSI. Low BMI was a risk factor for infection at initial implantation (P < 0.0012) using a BMI within 1.78 kg/m(2) of the cutoff for being underweight (100% sensitivity, 25% specificity). Low IQ (P = 0.0015) was also a risk factor for SSI.
   CONCLUSIONS: This study identified low BMI and low IQ at initial implantation as risk factors for infection.

AB OBJECTIVE: Recent literature suggests there are sex differences in delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI) after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH). Our study serves to compare sex differences in radiographic vasospasm, DCI, and clinical outcome after aSAH, and to determine whether there are age-dependent differences.
   METHODS: A total of 328 patients with ruptured cerebral aneurysms were evaluated for radiographic vasospasm, clinical deterioration, cerebral infarction, and modified Rankin Scale-determined clinical outcome at 6 months to 1 year after rupture. Multivariate regression analyses were performed to evaluate the associations between these outcome measures and sex, adjusting for age, hypertension, aneurysm location, admission Hunt and Hess grade, and modified Fisher grade.
   RESULTS: After multivariate adjustment, women had higher rates of radiographic vasospasm (beta= 0.35; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.068-0.63; P = 0.015), clinical deterioration (odds ratio [OR], 2.8; 95% CI, 1.3-6.0; P = 0.008) and cerebral infarction (OR, 2.4; 95% CI, 1.0-5.5; P = 0.039), but no difference was observed in follow-up modified Rankin Scale (mRS) outcome score at 6 months to 1 year (P = 0.96). Older women (age >55 years) have a higher rate of clinical deterioration than men in the same age group (OR, 3.5; 95% CI, 1.0-12; P = 0.043). In contrast, younger women (age <= 55 years) had increased radiographic vasospasm (beta = 0.55; 95% CI, 0.17-0.93; P = 0.005) and worse mRS outcome score (beta = 0.042; 95% CI, -0.021 to 1.1; P = 0.042) compared with men.
   CONCLUSIONS: Female sex is associated with a higher risk of radiographic vasospasm, clinical deterioration, and cerebral infarction. Furthermore, this association appears to be age-dependent. This study further supports the unique role of sex, and highlights the need to better understand the possible role of female hormones in the development of complications of subarachnoid hemorrhage.

AB BACKGROUND: The ability to achieve hemostasis after spontaneous subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) plays a pivotal role in outcome. Changes in coagulation in the early hours after SAH have been only sparsely investigated.
   OBJECTIVE: To investigate changes in coagulation after SAH and illuminate underlying mechanisms.
   METHODS: We enrolled 46 patients with spontaneous aneurysmal SAH. Blood samples were collected at admission and 24 hours after symptom onset. Thromboelastometry (ROTEM) was performed using the standard assays EXTEM, INTEM, and FIBTEM. Platelet maximum clot elasticity was calculated based on ROTEM results. Thrombin generation, levels of thrombin-antithrombin complex, fibrinogen, and coagulation factor XIII were measured. All data were compared with a gender-matched healthy control group.
   RESULTS: At admission (median, 3 hours 39 minutes from symptom onset), maximum clot firmness (EXTEM, P < 0.0001; INTEM, P = 0.08; FIBTEM, P < 0.0001) and platelet maximum clot elasticity (P < 0.0001) were higher in patients with SAH than in healthy controls. Thrombin generation showed higher, although nonsignificant, endogenous thrombin potential in patients with SAH than in healthy controls (P = 0.06), and thrombin-antithrombin complex levels were above the reference interval. Median fibrinogen and coagulation factor XIII levels were both within the reference parameters and remained increased 24 hours after symptom onset, whereas endogenous thrombin potential (P = 0.01) and thrombin-antithrombin complex levels decreased (P < 0.0001).
   CONCLUSIONS: Patients with SAH were in a hypercoagulable state at admission and remained so 24 hours after SAH. Increased clot firmness could be caused by increased platelet function, because platelet maximum clot elasticity was increased despite normal fibrinogen and coagulation factor XIII levels.

AB OBJECTIVE: Vasospasm (VSP)-related ischemic complications have been associated with poor outcomes in patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage due to ruptured blood blister-like aneurysms (BBAs) in the communicating segment of the internal carotid artery (ICA). The purpose of the present study was to investigate the incidence of, and factors related to, VSP-related cerebral infarction (VSP-CI) in patients with surgically treated BBAs in the communicating segment of the ICA.
   METHODS: The medical records of 25 consecutive patients with surgically treated BBAs in the communicating segment of the ICA were reviewed. The preoperative angiographic findings, surgical methods, and patient outcomes, including VSP-CI, were evaluated.
   RESULTS: Of the 25 patients, 10 had undergone extracranial-intracranial (EC-IC) bypass with trapping and 15 had undergone clipping surgery. VSP-CI occurred in the ipsilateral hemisphere to the aneurysm in 4 patients with EC-IC bypass with trapping and in 6 patients who had undergone received clipping. Positive balloon test occlusion findings did not affect the occurrence of VSP-CI in the EC-IC bypass and trapping group. The occurrence of VSP-CI was significantly greater in the patients with a dominant anterior cerebral artery ipsilateral to the aneurysm on preoperative angiogram (P = 0.023), with a hazard ratio of 14.14 (95% confidence interval, 1.57-127.68).
   CONCLUSIONS: The results of preoperative balloon test occlusion were less reliable for predicting postoperative ischemic complications of EC-IC bypass with trapping in patients with ruptured BBAs in the communicating segment of the ICA. However, anterior cerebral artery dominance ipsilateral to the ruptured aneurysm could be predictive for postoperative VSP-CI.

AB BACKGROUND: Vascular complications in posterior fossa surgery, even in microvascular decompression (MVD) involving a small cranial opening, can have catastrophic consequences. We analyzed these complications to determine the incidence, risk factors, prognosis, and preventive measures involved.
   METHODS: Between April 1997 and March 2018, 4000 consecutive patients with neurovascular compression syndrome were admitted and underwent MVD. We reviewed the medical records of patients who developed vascular complications after MVD, focusing on their past medical history, perioperative laboratory findings and images, surgical findings, and postoperative progress.
   RESULTS: Vascular complications developed in 28 patients (0.7%), including 24 with hemifacial spasm and 4 with trigeminal neuralgia. Twenty-two hemorrhagic (78.6%) and 6 ischemic (21.4%) complications occurred, with epidural hematoma the most frequent type identified. Ten patients (35.7%) patients were asymptomatic and 18 (64.3%) were symptomatic. Six patients (21.4%) underwent revision surgery, such as hematoma removal, craniectomy, or extraventricular drainage insertion. At the last follow-up, dizziness was the most commonly reported sequela from vascular complications. No deaths had occurred.
   CONCLUSIONS: Vascular complications are rare, but can be the most devastating adverse outcome of MVD surgery. Unusual signs and symptoms after MVD should prompt special attention to early management and patient safety.

AB OBJECTIVE: The effective treatment of giant cerebral arteriovenous malformations (gAVMs) is challenging. The aim of this study was to determine the risk factors for 1-stage resection of gAVM and develop a reliable indicator for patient selection.
   METHODS: A prospectively maintained database of patients with AVM in our hospital was reviewed. The neuroradiological findings and clinical characteristics of the patients and lesions were analyzed with respect to postoperative functional deficits (FD). A novel blood oxygen level-dependent functional magnetic resonance imaging score and a diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) score were created to predict surgical outcomes. Furthermore, the long-term outcomes of gAVMs treated by other methods in the literature were reviewed.
   RESULTS: A total of 35 patients with 35 gAVMs were included. The mean diameter of the gAVMs was 64.8 +/- 4.9 mm. In the univariate analysis, the functional magnetic resonance imaging score (P = 0.022) and DTI score (P = 0.003) were both significantly associated with longterm FD. The Spetzler-Martin score (P = 0.092) trended toward significance. Multivariate analysis revealed that a high DTI score (odds ratio, 2.19; 95% confidence interval, 1.08-4.46; P = 0.030) was the only independent risk factor that was correlated with long-term FD. The predictive effect of the DTI score (area under the curve = 0.822) is superior to that of the Spetzler-Martin score (area under the curve = 0.640) according to the receiver operating characteristic analysis, and the cutoff point was 2.5 (sensitivity = 0.860 and specificity = 0.867).
   CONCLUSIONS: One-stage surgical resection of gAVMs in patients with a low DTI score (0-2) seems to be feasible. The DTI score could be a reliable indicator for patient selection.

ID FIXATION; FUSION
AB INTRODUCTION: To compare radiological and clinical outcomes between partial and radical hemivertebra (HV) resection in congenital scoliosis (CS) patients with single nonincarcerated HV.
   METHODS: CS patients with single HV undergoing partial HV resection from February 2011 to May 2016 were retrospectively reviewed and included in the P group; those undergoing radical HV resection were included in the R group. Patients in R group were age-, sex-, curve magnitude-, and apex location-matched with those in P group. Comparisons were performed in terms of radiological results, clinical outcomes, and complications pre-operation, postoperation, and at the last follow-up between the P and R groups.
   RESULTS: Both P and R groups included 25 CS patients, and the mean age at surgery was 10.1 +/- 5.2 years. Compared with the R group, the P group had a similar correction of the Cobb angle at postoperation (38.6 +/- 6.7 degrees vs. 35.2 +/- 5.6 degrees, P = 0.057) and at the last follow-up (38.4 +/- 7.0 degrees vs. 34.7 +/- 6.7 degrees, P = 0.062). The estimated blood loss was 690.9 +/- 291.3 mL in the R group and 502.2 +/- 223.8 ml in the P group (P = 0.023), and the operating time was 259.4 +/- 70.2 minutes in the R group and 206.9 +/- 61.2 minutes in the P group (P = 0.007). During followup, no significant correction loss and major complication were observed in the P group, whereas 1 patient in the R group had rod breakage with pseudarthrosis at 24-month follow-up.
   CONCLUSIONS: Partial HV resection is a safe, effective, and less invasive procedure and achieved comparable correction with radical HV resection in the treatment of CS patients with single nonincarcerated HV.

AB BACKGROUND: As the prevalence of chronic liver disease continues to rise in the United States, understanding the effects of liver dysfunction on surgical outcomes has become increasingly important. The objective of this study was to assess the effects of chronic liver disease on 30-day complications following adult spinal deformity (ASD) surgery.
   METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort study of 2337 patients in the 2008-2015 American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program database who underwent corrective ASD surgery. Patients with liver disease were identified based on a Model for End-Stage Liver Disease-Na score >= 10. A univariate analysis was performed to compare 30-day postoperative complications between patients with and without liver disease. A multivariate regression analysis adjusting for differences in baseline patient characteristics was performed to identify complications that were associated with liver disease.
   RESULTS: Patients with liver disease had a significantly greater incidence of postoperative pulmonary complications (6.3% vs. 2.9%; P< 0.001), blood transfusion (34.6% vs. 24.0%; P < 0.001), sepsis (2.2% vs. 0.9%; P = 0.011), prolonged hospitalization (19.0% vs. 8.0%; P < 0.001), as well as any 30-day complication (45.4% vs. 29.4%; P < 0.001). The multivariate regression analysis identified liver disease as a risk factor for prolonged hospitalization (odds ratio [OR] 216; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.64-2.84; P < 0.001), pulmonary complications (OR 1.78; 95% CI 1.16-2.74; P = 0.009), blood transfusion (OR 1.67; 95% CI 1.36-2.05; P < 0.001), and any 30-day complication (OR 1.43; 95% CI 1.15-137; P = 0.001).
   CONCLUSIONS: The multisystem pathophysiology of liver dysfunction predisposes patients to postoperative complications following ASD surgery. A multidisciplinary approach in surgical planning and preoperative optimization is needed to minimize liver disease-related complications and improve patient outcomes.

AB OBJECTIVE: To understand cost distribution in a 90-day episode of care following posterior spinal fusions (PSFs) for adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS).
   METHODS: The 2007-2016 Humana PearlDiver dataset was queried using Current Procedural Terminology codes (22800, 22802, 22804, 22842, 22843, and 22844) to identify patients with AIS, aged 10-19 years, receiving PSFs. The following categories were used to define distribution in 90-day costs: 1) facility costs, 2) surgeon costs, 3) anesthesia costs, 4) intraoperative neuromonitoring, 5) hospital services and investigations, 6) intensive care unit stay, 7) radiology, 8) physical therapy/rehabilitation, 9) office visits, and 10) readmissions.
   RESULTS: A total of 455 patients with AIS received PSFs, of whom 381 (83.7%) were commercial insurance beneficiaries and 74 (16.3%) were Medicaid beneficiaries. The overall average 90-day cost of surgery was $124,360 with the 90-day stipulated bundled prices being $136,302 and $62,871 for commercial and Medicaid beneficiaries, respectively. Facility costs comprised 85% - 92% of the 90-day cost, followed by surgeon costs (5.2% - 5.7%). Post-acute care (physical therapy/rehab and office visits) was not a major driver of the 90-day cost (0.2% - 0.3%). Significant independent predictors of increased 90-day costs were-increased co-morbidity burden (+$11,284), >= 7 levels fusion (+$65,330), and length of stay (+$5298/day). Medicaid (-$81,957) payer type was associated with lower 90-day costs.
   CONCLUSIONS: Facility costs are a major determinant of overall 90-day costs following PSFs in AIS. Providers should aim at optimizing the co-morbidity burden and constructing accelerated care-pathways to decrease the length of stay and reduce the cost of the entire episode of care.

AB BACKGROUND: Cortical bone trajectory (CBT) screw is an attractive technique in terms of fixation strength and less invasiveness. However, the insertion of a pedicle screw penetrating cortical bone on the ideal trajectory is technically demanding. The use of 3-dimensional (3D) patient-matched guides may facilitate the use of this technique. In this technical note and case series, the use of a patient-matched 3D targeting guide for a circumferential fixation with CBT screws is described.
   METHODS: Eleven patients with a mean age of 49 years were treated. The MySpine MC (Medacta International SA, Castel San Pietro, Switzerland) technology was used to place CBT screws. A computed tomography (CT) scan- derived 3D model of the patient vertebra was created after the surgeons planned the best custom CBT screw trajectory. Then, scaffolds were printed and used during surgery to guide the screw through the patient pedicle. An intersomatic arthrodesis was also performed.
   RESULTS: The images of the planned trajectory were superimposed on the postoperative CT scan, confirming the accuracy of the trajectory. The mean deviation from the planned pedicle midpoint was 0.91 mm; 85.2% of the screws were placed within 2 degrees from the planned trajectory. There were 2 grade A (<2 mm) and no grade B or C perforations. The actual entry point was always within 2 mm from the planned entry point.
   CONCLUSIONS: This technical note and case series is the first clinical description on the use of a patient-matched guide for posterior CBT screw placement. The use of these devices could also improve placement accuracy and decrease the risk of nerve damage.

AB BACKGROUND: Advances in medical care and technology have dramatically improved outcomes in patients undergoing neurosurgical intervention; however, certain patient subgroups (e.g., older adults) may encounter greater rates of morbidity and mortality in the perioperative period. The objective of this study was to determine the effects of patient and hospital characteristics, including age, on in-hospital mortality, and complication rates of 3 routine neurosurgical operations: subdural hematoma evacuation, brain tumor resection, and degenerative spine procedures.
   METHODS: A retrospective multivariable analysis of the 2014 National Inpatient Sample was performed. The setting was a national sample of hospitalized inpatient stays occurring in 2014 in the United States. Patients (N = 48,963) included those undergoing subdural hematoma evacuation, brain tumor resection, or degenerative spine procedures, stratified according to age group (<65, 65-74, 75-84, 85+ years). Mortality and complication rate were measured.
   RESULTS: Age >= 85 years was found to increase the odds of mortality (odds ratio 11.32) and complications (odds ratio 2.64) in patients undergoing degenerative spine procedures, whereas age had no significant effect on mortality and complication rate in subdural hematoma evacuation and brain tumor resection. Multiple comorbidities and nonelective status were predictors of increased mortality and complication rate in all procedure groups.
   CONCLUSIONS: Overall, our data would suggest that increased age does not universally predict worse outcome and that, for many procedures, surgical decision-making in older patients should instead consider other pertinent factors, such as comorbidities and elective status.

   cervical internal carotid artery stenosis; Staged angioplasty; Tissue

ID CEREBRAL HYPERPERFUSION SYNDROME; ENDARTERECTOMY; ANGIOPLASTY
AB BACKGROUND: Acute ischemic stroke caused by cervical internal carotid artery stenosis (ICS) with altered consciousness and progressive paralysis leads to a poor neurologic prognosis. When such a patient is brought to the hospital in the hyperacute phase, intravenous tissue plasminogen activator is first administered. However, when an indwelling carotid artery stent is required after administration, physicians often hesitate to use antithrombotic drugs. In this report, we propose performing staged angioplasty (SAP) for such cases.
   METHODS: Four patients were retrospectively investigated. In all 4 patients, we immediately performed only percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) without antiplatelet drugs. If both cerebral perfusion on angiography and neurologic findings improved, no additional treatment was provided; otherwise, emergency carotid artery stenting (eCAS) was performed. In PTA-successful cases, eCAS or carotid endarterectomy (CEA) was performed with single or dual antiplatelet drugs at a later date.
   RESULTS: The success rate of PTA was 50% (2 of 4), and the overall treatment success rate was 100% (4 of 4). Three patients had favorable outcomes (modified Rankin Scale [mRS] score 0-2), but unfortunately, 1 patient had severe disability (mRS score >3) on discharge. The PTA-successful patients had no perioperative complications. On the other hand, 1 of the 2 patients who underwent eCAS experienced embolic complications, including distal embolization.
   CONCLUSIONS: In this investigation, both eCAS and SAP could be performed safety. However, performing SAP first without antiplatelet drugs to avoid hemorrhagic complications and cerebral hyperperfusion syndrome appears to have considerable validity.

ID EXPERIENCE; OPERATIONS; SERIES; HEAD
AB OBJECTIVE: Overlapping surgery, performed by the same primary attending surgeon asynchronously, has gained significant attention from the government and media as potentially harmful to patients. Therefore, the goal of this study was to evaluate the outcomes and safety of overlapping versus nonoverlapping microvascular decompression (MVD) operations.
   METHODS: Patients who underwent MVD operations were retrospectively reviewed: 1153 with hemifacial spasm (HFS), 694 (60.2%) of whom underwent overlapping procedures, and 935 with trigeminal neuralgia (TN), 612 (65.5%) of whom underwent overlapping procedures. Collected variables included patient age, sex, side, disease duration, clinical characteristic, comorbidity, affected vessel, intraoperative neuroelectrophysiology, operation time under microscope, total surgical procedure times, mean length of stay (LOS), efficacy (at discharge, 6 months, 1 year), short-term complications, and long-term complications. chi(2) and t tests were performed to compare overlapping versus nonoverlapping cases, and then multivariate analysis were conducted to adjust for patient demographics, clinical characteristics, and comorbidity between the 2 groups.
   RESULTS: Patient variables (age, sex, side, disease duration, clinical characteristic, and comorbidity), affected vessel, and intraoperative neuroelectrophysiology were similar between the 2 groups. After adjustment for patient demographics, clinical characteristics, and comorbidity, overlapping surgeries had longer total surgical procedure times (HFS: standardized coefficient = 0.066, P < 0.05; TN: standardized coefficient = 0.086, P < 0.05). Overlapping surgery was not associated with a significant difference in operation time under microscope, mean LOS, efficacy (at discharge, 6 months, 1 year), short-term complications, and long-term complications.
   CONCLUSIONS: Overlapping MVD operations may be performed safely at our institution. Further prospective studies are needed to understand the association of overlapping surgery among MVD operations.

ID ENDOVASCULAR TREATMENT; ANEURYSMS
AB BACKGROUND: Medullary infarction (MI) occasionally _urs after treatment of ruptured vertebral artery dissection (VAD). The aim of this study was to validate whether flow reduction for ruptured unilateral VAD by proximal clipping prevents rebleeding and MI in comparison with trapping.
   METHODS: Thirty-one patients who underwent direct surgery or endovascular procedures for unilateral ruptured VAD and postoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), including 9 patients treated with trapping and 22 patients treated with proximal clipping, were enrolled. For posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA) -involved type VAD, occipital artery to PICA anastomosis was added as needed to isolate the rupture point. The rate of rebleeding and the occurrence of MI on MRI were compared between the 2 groups.
   RESULTS: There was no rebleeding after treatment in all 31 patients. However, 5 patients had MI on postoperative MRI (16.1%, kappa = 0.903). In 5 of the 9 patients treated with trapping, MI was seen on MRI after treatment (55.6%). On the other hand, 0 of the 22 patients treated with proximal clipping developed MI (P < 0.01).
   CONCLUSIONS: Appropriate flow reduction for ruptured unilateral VAD by proximal clipping is thought to be effective for preventing rebleeding and avoiding MI.

ID MANAGEMENT; GUIDELINES; IMPACT; CARE
AB OBJECTIVE: Intracranial pressure (ICP)-guided therapy has been the mainstay of treatment of patients with severe traumatic brain injury (TBI), but recent data have questioned its efficacy. The aim of this study was to demonstrate trends in compliance to TBI guidelines and use of ICP-guided care in a mature trauma system.
   METHODS: A retrospective analysis was conducted of 36,915 patients with severe TBI collected by the Pennsylvania Trauma Systems Foundation. The registry includes all patients >18 years old with a diagnosis of TBI with a Glasgow Coma Scale score <= 8 who were admitted from January 2000 to December 2017.
   RESULTS: Of 36,915 patients, 73.6% were men with a median age of 43.0 +/- 21.3 years. An ICP monitor was placed in 16.3% of all patients. The rate of ICP monitoring ranged from 17.8% of patients in 2000-2004 to 16.7% in 2005-2009, 16.4% in 2010-2014, and 12.8% in 2015-2017 (P< 0.001). The most statistically significant decrease was noted from 2014 (16.4%) to 2015 (14.1%, P = 0.042). The percent decrease in ICP monitoring from 2000-2014 to 2015-2017 was equivalent for patients with Glasgow Coma Scale scores of 3-5 ( - 4.0%) and 6-8 ( - 4.5%).
   CONCLUSIONS: As studies emerged that demonstrated unclear benefit of ICP monitoring in improving care in patients with severe TBI, there was a significant statewide decline in the use of ICP monitoring after 2014 among all TBI subpopulations despite noteworthy limitations in the aforementioned studies and clear recommendations recommendations from the Brain Trauma Foundation guidelines.

AB OBJECTIVE: The AOSpine Subaxial Cervical Spine Injury Classification System was introduced to improve communication, clinical management, and research. Here, the system was studied in relation to injury severity along with admission and long term neurologic follow-up.
   METHODS: A retrospective study was performed in subaxial cervical spine injury patients. Morphology was classified using the AOSpine Subaxial Cervical Spine Injury Classification System. Six major morphology subtypes were selected for analysis. The American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) motor and Abbreviated Injury Severity (AIS) scores were recorded at admission and at follow-up >6 months. Admission intramedullary lesion length (IMLL) on MRI was recorded.
   RESULTS: In all, 82 patients met criteria for analysis. The mean follow-up time was 11 months (range, 6-33 months). The were 36 patients with morphology subtypes A0, 4 with A1/A2, 9 with A3/A4, 8 with B2, 11 with B3, and 14 with C. The A1/2 subtype had the least severe injuries on admission. The C and A3/A4 subtypes had the most severe injuries. The subtype C had the lowest ASIA Motor Score (AMS) and second highest percentage of complete injuries. A3/A4 patients had the highest percentage of complete injuries on admission. At follow-up, A3/A4 patients had the lowest AMS, and 33% of patients continued to have complete injuries. C subtype injuries all converted to AIS incomplete injuries on follow-up (P = 0.04). IMLL was found to be significantly different compared across multiple morphologic subtypes. Surgical management for each morphology subtype was reported.
   CONCLUSION: The AOSpine Subaxial Cervical Spine Injury Classification System successfully associated injury morphology with IMLL along with admission and long-term neurologic function and recovery.

AB OBJECTIVE: Durotomy is a necessary procedure for resection of spinal intradural-extramedullary (IDEM) tumor. The purpose of this study was to investigate the prevalence and clinical implications of pneumocephalus after spinal IDEM tumor surgery and also the association between pneumocephalus and postoperative headache.
   METHODS: This prospective study was conducted in a cohort of 20 patients who were diagnosed with a spinal IDEM tumor and underwent surgical resection. The mean patient age was 53.6 years (range, 29-75 years). Histological findings revealed schwannoma in 16 cases (80.0%) and meningioma in 4 cases (20.0%). Brain computed tomography scan was performed immediately after surgery. The prevalence and severity were analyzed based on the classification into 4 groups according to the extension of pneumocephalus: absence, mild, moderate, and severe. A visual analog scale (VAS; range 0-10) for headache was reported daily for the first postoperative week. Headache-related pneumocephalus was defined as a VAS score of >= 5 points at least once in that 1-week period.
   RESULTS: The prevalence of pneumocephalus was 90.0% (18 patients). Five patients (25.0%) had severe pneumocephalus extending to the extra-axial space. Seven of the 20 patients (38.9%) complained of significant headache. Five of these patients had severe pneumocephalus, 1 patient had moderate pneumocephalus, and 1 patient had moderate pneumocephalus. A statistically significant association was observed between the severity of pneumocephalus and headache (P = 0.001).
   CONCLUSIONS: Pneumocephalus is a common complication after spinal IDEM tumor surgery. This report is the first study to investigate the prevalence of pneumocephalus and analyze its association with headache after spine surgery. The severity of pneumocephalus was significantly related to postoperative headache.

AB OBJECTIVE: To analyze a consecutive series of patients with middle cerebral artery (MCA) aneurysms who needed an adjunctive cerebral revascularization procedure to achieve aneurysm occlusion with preservation of flow through all MCA branches.
   METHODS: A total of 42 patients with 43 MCA aneurysms underwent 52 bypass procedures over 13 years. The location of the aneurysm were M1 trunk, M1 bifurcation, M2 and beyond. The bypasses performed included intracranial bypasses (resection with end to end anastomosis, end to side implantation, side to side anastomosis, and short interposition graft), extraintracranial bypasses (superficial temporal to middle cerebral artery anastomosis, and radial artery bypass graft, or saphenous vein graft), double bypasses, Y-grafts, and combined techniques.
   RESULTS: Forty-two of 43 aneurysms (98%) had patent bypasses at long-term follow-up. All 43 aneurysms were completely occluded at last follow-up. Six patients (14%) developed strokes related to the surgical treatment. At last follow-up, 36 patients had a modified Rankin score of 0-2, 5 patients had modified Rankin score 3-5, and 1 died. In this series, 31 (73.8%) patients improved, 8 (19%) patients had same functional status, and 3 (7.2%) patients deteriorated, including 1 patient who expired due to sepsis. The mean clinical follow-up duration was 39.3 months (0.4-124 months) and the mean radiological follow-up was 37 months (0.4-134 months).
   CONCLUSIONS: Cerebral revascularization is an important adjunct for treating MCA aneurysms and can be done safely. The article provides the insights we gained by rising through the learning curve.

AB BACKGROUND: In patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI), whether sleep disorder is associated with disturbances in molecular rhythmicity is unclear. This study aimed to investigate the relationship between abnormal sleep and regulation by circadian rhythms in patients with TBI.
   METHODS: We sampled buccal cells and human blood samples from patients with TBI diagnosed with sleep disorders and those with normal sleep and investigated differences in the expression levels of Clock, Per2, and Bmal1 between the 2 groups.
   RESULTS: The expression peaks of Clock, Per2, and Bmal1 were at 12:00. There was a statistically significant difference between the sleep disorder group and the normal sleep group in the level of Clock mRNA expression (P = 0.0003 in oral mucosa and P < 0.0001 in mononuclear cells). There was no significant between-group difference in Small mRNA expression level (P = 0.1187 in oral mucosa and P = 0.2094 in mononuclear cells). There were significant between-group differences in Per2 mRNA expression levels at 12:00 (P = 0.0102 in oral mucosa and P = 0.0006 in mononuclear cells) and 18:00 (P = 0.0004 in oral mucosa and P = 0.0015 in mononuclear cells) but no significant difference at 24:00 (P = 0.7838 in oral mucosa and P = 0.2808 in mononuclear cells).
   CONCLUSIONS: Abnormal expression levels of Per2, Clock, and Bmal1 were detected in patients with TBI-related sleep disorders. These novel findings demonstrate disturbances in the molecular clock in TBI patients and have important implications for our understanding of the aberrant rhythms reported in this disease.

DT Article
DE Edema; Gamma knife; Local failure; Meningioma; Predictive factors
ID STEREOTACTIC RADIOSURGERY; PERITUMORAL EDEMA; TUMOR-CONTROL; PREDICTORS
AB BACKGROUND: Before the advent of radiosurgery, neurosurgical treatment of meningiomas typically involved gross total resection of the mass whenever surgery was deemed possible. Over the past 4 decades, though, Gamma Knife radiosurgery (GKRS) has proved to be an effective, minimally invasive means to control the growth of these tumors. However, the variables associated with treatment failure (regrowth or clinical progression) after GKRS and GKRS-related complications, such as cerebral edema, are less well understood.
   METHODS: We retrospectively collected data between 2009 and 2018 for patients who underwent GKRS for meningiomas. After data collection, we performed univariate and multivariable modeling of the factors that predict treatment failure and cerebral edema after GKRS. Hazard ratios (HR) and P values were determined for these variables.
   RESULTS: Fifty-two patients were included our analysis. The majority of patients were female (38/52,73%), and nearly all patients presented with a suspected or confirmed World Health Organization grade 1 meningioma (48/52, 92%). The median tumor volume was 3.49 cc (range, 0.22-20.11 cc). Evidence of meningioma progression after treatment developed in 5 patients (10%), with a median time to continued tumor growth of 5.9 months (range, 2.7-18.3 months). In multivariable analysis, patients in whom treatment failed were more likely to be male (HR = 8.42, P = 0.045) and to present with larger tumor volumes (HR = 1.27, P = 0.011). In addition, 5 patients (10%) experienced treatment-related cerebral edema. On univariate analysis, patients who experienced cerebral edema were more likely present with larger tumors (HR = 1.16, P = 0.028).
   CONCLUSIONS: Increasing meningioma size and male gender predispose to meningioma progression after treatment with GKRS. Increasing tumor size also predicts the development of postradiosurgery cerebral edema.

AB OBJECTIVE: Solitary fibrous tumor/hemangiopericytoma (SFT/HPC) and meningioma exhibit similar radiographic features; however, they differ in their prognoses. Preoperative differentiation between them is important for determining the treatment and follow-up plan. The aim of this study was to determine the factors that can be used to differentiate SFT/HPC from meningioma and World Health Organization (WHO) grade I from grade II meningioma.
   METHODS: The analysis included 84 cases: 5 of SFT/HPC, 72 of WHO grade I meningioma, and 7 of WHO grade II meningioma. Clinical characteristics and conventional magnetic resonance imaging, perfusion magnetic resonance imaging, and magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) LCModel parameters were evaluated via multivariate logistic regression analysis to identify the factors that distinguish SFT/HPC from meningioma.
   RESULTS: Patients with SFT/HPC were mostly men and were younger than those with meningioma. The percentage of T2-weighted images in meningioma was greater than that in SFT/HPC. There were significant differences between SFT/HPC and meningioma in levels of glutamate, phosphocholine, myo-inositol, or glycerophosphocholine + phosphocholine derived from long echo-time MRS, and myoinositol derived from short echo-time MRS. Stepwise logistic regression analysis revealed that the age of <45 years and myo-inositol in short echo-time MRS of >= 6.347 were associated with a diagnosis of SFT/HPC with high sensitivity and specificity. However, no factors were found that differentiated WHO grade I meningioma from WHO grade II meningioma.
   CONCLUSIONS: Age and myo-inositol level calculated from MRS are useful factors for distinguishing SFT/HPC from meningioma preoperatively.

AB INTRODUCTION: Quality assurance (QA) is a way to prevent mistakes in advance. Although it has been previously reported for surgical setup, there is no effective approach for minimizing microsurgical technical errors before an operation is done. Neurosurgery resident operative errors during brain aneurysm surgery could be foreseen by practicing in an ex vivo hybrid simulator with microscopic fluorescein vessel flow image.
   METHODS: Five vascular neurosurgeons and 8 junior/senior neurosurgical residents voluntarily joined this research initiative. The following methodology was adopted: 1) Identification of the 7 most-common resident operative performance errors during brain aneurysm surgery; 2) Design of exercises to prevent common mistakes in brain aneurysm microsurgery using a placenta simulator; and 3) Blinded staff neurosurgeon evaluation of resident performance during real brain aneurysm microsurgery.
   RESULTS: All key steps to perform such intervention were accomplished with a simulator that uses 2 placentas, a synthetic cranium, and microscopic fluorescein vessel flow image. Neurosurgery residents trained in this model had better surgical performance with fewer perioperative mistakes (P < 0.05). Fine microsurgical dissection of the arachnoid membrane and aneurysm sac were the most commonly improved tasks among the 7 common operative mistakes. Brain parenchyma traction with secondary bleeding was the only error not prevented after previous simulator training.
   CONCLUSIONS: There was a left-shift on the quality assurance line with residents who practiced brain aneurysm microsurgical errors in an ex vivo model. A multicentric prospective study is necessary to confirm the hypothesis that real operative error could be reduced after training in a realistic simulator.

AB OBJECTIVE: The number of citations an article receives is an important measure of impact for published research. There are limited published data on predictors of citations in neurosurgery research. We aimed to analyze predictors of citations for neurosurgical articles.
   METHODS: All articles published in 14 neurosurgical journals in the year 2015 were examined and data collected about their features. The number of citations for each article was tallied using both Web of Science (WoS) and Google Scholar (GS) 2.5 years after their publication in print. Negative binomial regression was then performed to determine the relationship between article features and citation counts for scientific articles.
   RESULTS: A total of 3923 articles were analyzed, comprising 2867 scientific articles (72.6%) and 1056 nonscientific (editorial, commentary, etc.) articles (27.4%). At 2.5 years, scientific articles had a median [interquartile range] number of citations per article of 3.0 [6.0] and 7.0 [9.0] found in WoS and GS, respectively; nonscientific articles had accumulated median 0.0 [2.0] in both WOS and GS. Articles with the study topic "Spine" had the highest citation count at 4.0 [5.0] and 8.0 [10.0] in WoS and GS, respectively. Significant predictors of citation count in scientific articles were level of evidence, number of centers, number of authors, and impact factor.
   CONCLUSIONS: This is the largest investigation analyzing predictors of citations in the neurosurgical literature. Factors found to be most influential on citation rates in scientific articles included the study's level of evidence, number of participating centers, number of authors, and the publishing journal's impact factor.

AB BACKGROUND: Maffucci syndrome (MS) and Oilier disease (OD) are rare diseases characterized by multiple benign enchondromas. The incidence of skull base (SB) enchondromas and the risk of malignant transformation remain unknown. Most SB lesions are asymptomatic, and surgical resection carries significant morbidity. Observation may be a reasonable strategy. We report our experience with observation of probable SB enchondromas in MS/OD patients.
   METHODS: Retrospective review of OD/MS patients with cranial imaging between 1995 and 2018 at 1 institution.
   RESULTS: 14 patients were included: 3 with MS (21.4%) and 11 with OD (78.6%). The median age was 28 years (range, 11-74 years) and 57.1% were female. Extracranial chondrosarcoma was reported in 3 (21.4%) patients. Seven (50%) patients with SB enchondroma or chondrosarcoma were identified on initial imaging. In patients with SB lesions, the indications for imaging were headache (n =3), seizure (n =1), and diplopia (n =1); 2 cases were incidental findings. The most commonly involved structures were petroclival fissure (86%) and clivus (71%). Treatment included observation (6/7) and resection (1/7). Follow-up imaging was available for all SB lesions, with a mean interval of 50.7 months (range, 5-225 months) and was negative for progression in all patients.
   CONCLUSIONS: Primary SB lesions in OD/MS patients frequently present in the petroclival junction. Cranial screening and close observation should be considered in MS/OD patients, given the increased risk of intra-axial intracranial tumors, de novo chondrosarcomas, or malignant degeneration of previously known lesions. In asymptomatic patients, observation appears to be a safe strategy in this cohort. Further case accumulation and follow-up are required to better understand the long-term outcomes.

AB OBJECTIVE: Pituitary apoplexy is associated with visual, cranial nerve, and endocrine dysfunction. In this article, the results of surgical and conservative management of pituitary apoplexy in a single center are evaluated and a review of the literature is presented.
   METHODS: A retrospective analysis was made of patients with pituitary apoplexy who underwent surgery or conservative management at our center between January 2007 and June 2017. Surgery was typically selected for patients who presented with acute deterioration of visual status and/or level of consciousness. Patients with no visual field deficit and those who had medical contraindications to undergo a surgical procedure because of previous comorbidities typically had conservative treatment. Baseline characteristics and clinical and radiologic outcomes were reviewed. A review of the literature (1990-2018) was performed according to PRISMA guidelines. Studies comparing the results of conservative and surgical management were identified. Visual, cranial nerve, and endocrine outcomes and tumor recurrence were analyzed.
   RESULTS: Forty-nine patients (73.1%) were managed surgically and 18 (26.9%) conservatively. After careful case selection, patients underwent surgical or conservative treatment. Patients who underwent conservative treatment had fewer visual deficits. At diagnosis, visual deficit (38.8% vs. 75.5%; P = 0.008) and cranial nerve palsy (27.7% vs. 51%; P = 0.058) were less common in the conservative group. Conservative and surgical treatments had similar visual and cranial nerve improvement rates (75% vs. 58.3%, P = 0.63 and 75% vs. 692%, P = 1.0, respectively). In the conservative group, tumor shrinkage was observed in 76.4% of cases. The systematic review retrieved 11 studies. No significant difference between conservative and surgical treatment for clinical outcomes (visual field recovery, odds ratio [OR], 1.45; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.72-2.92; cranial nerve recovery, OR, 2.30; 95% CI, 0.93-5.65; and hypopituitarism, OR, 1.05; 95% CI, 0.64-1.74) or tumor recurrence (OR, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.20-2.34) was observed.
   CONCLUSIONS: A tailored approach to pituitary apoplexy, one that does not include an absolute need for surgery, is appropriate. Conservative management is appropriate in selected patients presenting without visual deficits.

AB OBJECTIVE: Surgical site infections (SSIs) complicate 1% to 9% of elective spine surgeries. Previously identified risk factors include diabetes mellitus type 2, obesity, and chronic kidney disease. We sought to determine whether the use of postoperative surgical site drains is associated with deep SSIs.
   METHODS: We retrospectively identified patients operated for deep SSIs after surgery for degenerative spine pathologies between July 2016 and December 2018. Patients were excluded if the reason for operation was other than deep SSI or if their primary operation was for infection or tumor. Using their index procedure and the electronic medical record, patients were matched to controls based on age, surgical invasiveness, International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification code, race, and sex. Our main outcome of interest was whether drain retention time, total output, or daily output differed significantly between cases and controls.
   RESULTS: We identified 38 patients who met inclusion criteria. Infected patients had a higher body mass index (34.2 vs. 29.9 kg/m(2); P = 0.001), higher odds of having diabetes mellitus type 2 (55.3% vs. 18.4%; P = 0.002), longer drain retention time (5.5 vs. 3.5 days; P = 0.02), and longer inpatient stay (9.5 vs. 4.3 days; P = 0.005). Multivariable logistic regression demonstrated that even after controlling for the other risk factors, drain retention time independently predicted postoperative surgical site infection (odds ratio: 1.36; P = 0.02).
   CONCLUSIONS: Prolonged surgical drain retention correlates with risk of deep SSI after surgery for degenerative spine disease independent of surgical invasiveness, diabetes mellitus type 2 status, and total drain output. Our data suggest early postoperative drain removal may potentially decrease the risk of SSI and shorten duration of hospital stay.

TI Role of Klotho Protein in Tumor Genesis, Cancer Progression, and

DT Article
DE Glioblastoma; Klotho
ID SUPPRESSOR; GLIOBLASTOMA; APOPTOSIS; MUTATION; HORMONE; GROWTH; BRAIN;
   CELLS; RISK; MICE
AB BACKGROUND: Klotho, a single-pass transmembrane protein associated with premature aging, acts as a tumor suppressor gene by inhibiting insulin/insulin-like growth factor-1 and fibroblast growth factor pathways. Downregulated Klotho expression is reported in melanoma, mesothelioma, bladder, breast, gastric, cervix, lung, and kidney cancers and is associated with a poor prognosis. Klotho expression and Klotho promoter hypermethylation are predictive factors for patient prognosis.
   METHODS: To investigate the potential role of Klotho in glioblastoma-multiforme (GBM), 22 GBM samples were collected from the Sheba Tumor Bank and examined.
   RESULTS: We found that increased Klotho messenger ribonucleic acid (RNA) expression predicted longer survival (P = 0.03) of GBM patients. Methylation analysis was performed on bisulfite-treated deoxyribonucleic acid from the GBM patient samples using ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry according to the Sequenom EpiTYPER protocols. Klotho promoter hypermethylation was detected in 65% of the GBM samples and correlated significantly with improved survival (P < 0.04). We found 3 major Klotho promotor hypermethylation sites located 585-579 bp, 540-533 bp, and 537-534 bp upstream of the transcription start site. Methylated deoxyribonucleic acid immunoprecipitation studies confirmed these results. Notably, the messenger RNA expression in these GBM samples revealed an unexpected linear correlation with methylation of these 3 hypermethylation sites identified in the Klotho promotor. Thus Klotho expression and methylation could predict prognosis in patients with GBM.
   CONCLUSIONS: Epigenetic regulation in GBM appears to be complicated. Specific CpG islands affect genes or micro RNAs that interact to control Klotho expression. The diverse effects of these islands may be due to unique factors of GBM.

TI Minimally Invasive Resection of Brain Metastases
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
LA English
DT Article
DE Brain metastasis; Minimally invasive
ID RANDOMIZED-TRIAL; SINGLE; SURGERY
AB BACKGROUND: Minimally invasive resection of brain metastases aims to maximize resection while minimizing brain trauma.
   METHODS: Patients with 1 or more metastases that underwent resection following neuro-oncology multidisciplinary meeting discussion from September 2014 to October 2018, with pre- and postoperative magnetic resonance imaging, were included. All patients including posterior fossa metastases or multiple metastases were positioned supine. Hair was not shaved. Volumetric post-contrast T1 magnetic resonance imaging was used for incision planning and neuronavigation. The craniotomy site was tailored to tumor depth according to keyhole principles and ranged between 2 and 5 cm. Intraoperative monitoring and awake mapping were carried out in selected cases.
   RESULTS: Out of 320 consecutive patients with brain metastases, 44 patients were identified as suitable for minimally invasive resection. Nine patients had no postoperative imaging and were excluded. There were 38 metastases in 35 patients. There were 18 cerebellar metastases, 10 frontal, 3 parietal, 3 occipital, 2 temporal, 1 intraventricular, and 1 basal ganglia. Median length of stay was 3 days (range, 1-24). Average tumor volume was 54.7 cm(3) (range, 10-240 cm(3)). Endoscopic assistance was used in 4 patients. Median performance status improved from 2 to 1 (range, preoperative: 0-4; postoperative: 0-2). Median survival was 14.7 months.
   CONCLUSIONS: Minimally invasive resection of brain metastasis is safe and effective, and in selected cases confers advantages compared with standard techniques.

AB BACKGROUND: Primary melanocytic neoplasms of the central nervous system (CNS) are rare and account for 1% of all melanomas. This study used the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database to evaluate the epidemiology of primary CNS melanoma and further characterize their treatment.
   METHODS: Data from the National Cancer Institute SEER program, collected from 1973-2015, were retrospectively analyzed. A total of 86 records of malignant melanoma cases with CNS as the primary site were identified, and 54 patients were studied based on the inclusion criteria. Demographic, tumor, and treatment regimen effectiveness were studied.
   RESULTS: A total of 54 patients were included in this study. Tumors were distributed evenly in size and localized primarily to the cerebral meninges and spinal cord. A total of 13% of patients underwent biopsy, 40.7% gross total resection (GTR), 7.4% subtotal resection (STR), 46.3% radiation therapy (RT), and 27.3% chemotherapy (CT) in a variety of treatment combinations. GTR alone and STR + RT resulted in increased disease-specific survival compared to biopsy alone, but no survival benefit was found with biopsy with RT and/or CT as well as STR alone.
   CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the largest single database study completed for primary malignant melanoma of the CNS. The study identified the need for tumor resection for the proper treatment of these lesions, particularly GTR. GTR could be paired with adjuvant RT or RT + CT providing survival benefit as well. In cases when GTR is unable to be completed, STR + RT provides significant improvement in survival compared to biopsy alone.

AB BACKGROUND: Most Americans consult the Internet to address their health concerns. Limited health literacy among the public highlights the need for patient education Web sites to deliver understandable health information. We assessed the understandability and actionability of online neurosurgical patient education materials (PEMs) provided by the American Association of Neurological Surgeons (AANS) and MedlinePlus.
   METHODS: Articles on neurosurgical conditions and treatments listed on both the AANS site and MedlinePlus were analyzed. Two reviewers scored articles using 2 validated health literacy tools, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Clear Communication Index (CCI) and the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) Patient Education Materials Assessment Tool (PEMAT). These tools evaluate the quality of written health information and assess for content, organization, and actionability of PEMs.
   RESULTS: One hundred and thirty-eight articles were evaluated from the AANS (n = 61) and MedlinePlus (n = 77). The median CCI score for MedlinePlus and AANS articles was 68.9 {interquartile range [IQR], 62.5-81.3) and 56.3 [IQR, 46.7-73.7], respectively (P < 0.001). Only 1 article scored >= 90%, which is the CCI threshold for PEMs to be considered easy to read. Although the AANS and Medline performed similarly on the understandability component of the PEMAT (66.7 [IQR, 53.8-69.2] vs. 69.2 [IQR, 66.7-83.3], respectively; P < 0.001), significant differences were observed for the actionability section of the PEMAT (Medline 60 [IQR, 60-60] vs. AANS 0 [IQR, 0-60]; P < 0.001). Less than 13% of articles provided summaries, visual aids, and tangible tools to aid patient action.
   CONCLUSIONS: Neurosurgical online PEMs may be difficult to understand and potentially act as barriers for patients' engagement with health systems. There is a need to deliver patient-centered health information that effectively informs patients, aiding in meaningful health decision making.

AB OBJECTIVE: To assess whether preoperative T1 slope and cervical lordosis mismatching affect the surgical outcomes of patients with cervical spondylotic myelopathy (CSM) after laminoplasty.
   METHODS: A total of 85 patients with CSM who underwent unilateral open-door laminoplasty between January 2013 and May 2017 were retrospectively reviewed. Based on preoperative T1 slope and C2-C7 lordosis matching, the patients were divided into 2 groups: the match group and the mismatch group. The T1 slope minus C2-C7 lordosis (T1S-CL) <20 was defined as matching. Radiographic parameters included T1 slope, C2-C7 lordosis, C2-C7 sagittal vertical axis (SVA), and T1S-CL. Clinical outcomes were based on the Neck Disability Index (NDI) and Japanese Orthopedic Association (JOA) scores.
   RESULTS: The preoperative T1S-CL had significant correlation with T1 slope (r = 0.283), C2-C7 lordosis (r = -0.611), and C2-C7 SVA (r = 0.331). At the final follow-up, patients in the mismatch group had a higher incidence of postoperative cervical kyphosis (P = 0.007) and C2-C7 SVA >40 mm (P = 0.043). The mismatch group also had greater Delta C2-C7 lordosis (P = 0.028), Delta C2-C7 SVA (P = 0.042), and Delta T1S-CL = 0.044). Comparison of clinical outcomes revealed that patients in the match group had better NDI and JOA recovery (P < 0.05).
   CONCLUSIONS: T1S-CL is a clinically relevant parameter for surgical decision making because patients with T1S-CL mismatching are more likely to have postoperative kyphotic alignment changes and cervical sagittal imbalance. Laminoplasty might not be a suitable option for patients with T1S-CL mismatching.

AB OBJECTIVE: Middle cerebral artery (MCA) aneurysms have continued to be primarily managed microsurgically. In cases of complex MCA aneurysms, revascularization could facilitate effective aneurysm treatment. The MCA candelabra provides excellent candidates for in situ side-to-side bypass. In the present case series, we have described applications of MCA in situ side-to-side bypass for the management of complex MCA aneurysms, along with a review of the pertinent data.
   METHODS: A retrospective review of a prospectively maintained neurosurgical patient database was performed to identify all patients treated with MCA side-to-side in situ bypass. Six consecutive patients were identified and included in the present series, representing a single-surgeon experience from February 2016 to November 2018.
   RESULTS: Of the 6 complex MCA aneurysms, all were unruptured, and one half had been treated via a minipterional approach that also allowed for simultaneous anterior communicating artery aneurysm clipping in 1 case. The median temporary occlusion time for anastomosis was 33 minutes (interquartile range [IQR], 30.3-35 minutes). Bypass patency was confirmed in all cases both intraoperatively and postoperatively. The median hospitalization time was 4.5 days (IQR, 2-8 days). The median follow-up period was 5.5 months (IQR, 2.8-22.3 months). All patients had achieved excellent or good (<= 1) modified Rankin scale scores at discharge and during the follow-up period. No mortalities occurred, and no technical, bypass-related, or ischemic morbidities had developed.
   CONCLUSIONS: Our experience with MCA side-to-side in situ bypass has demonstrated its safety and utility in complex MCA aneurysm management. The favorable anatomy of the MCA branches allows for minimally invasive revascularization and clipping that can potentially reduce the hospitalization time and incidence of perioperative morbidity.

AB OBJECTIVE: The treatment of spinal metastasis carries significant surgical morbidity, and decompression and stabilization are often necessary. Less invasive techniques may reduce risks and postoperative pain. This study describes the differences between a mini-open (MO) procedure and a traditional open surgery (OS) for symptomatic spinal metastasis, and reports differences in outcome for similar patients undergoing each procedure.
   METHODS: We describe a MO technique and retrospective analysis of 20 OS patients who were matched to 20 MO patients by histology, spinal region, and levels instrumented. MO surgery combined a traditional midline exposure for tumor resection with transfascial pedicle screw fixation. Outcome measures included estimated blood loss (EBL), operative time (OT), length of stay (LOS), transfusion rate, complication rate, ASIA Impairment Scale motor score (AMS), and pain scores. Statistical analysis used unpaired t tests and Fisher exact test.
   RESULTS: Average age of the patients was 58.3 years. Forty-eight percent of patients were women. Average number of levels treated was 5.9. Both groups had similar LOS (P = 0.98), OT (P = 0.30), perioperative complication rates (P = 0.51), transfusion rates (P = 0.33), and AMS (P = 0.17). EBL was found to be significantly lower in the MO group than the open group (805 +/- 138 mL vs. 1732 +/- 359 mL, respectively; P = 0.019). The MO group had a significant reduction in postoperative pain (-1.71 +/- 0.5 vs. 0.33 +/- 0.7, P = 0.018).
   CONCLUSIONS: Although further studies are needed, the MO approach appears to result in decreased blood loss and postoperative pain, without compromising neural element decompression or spinal stability. These findings are consistent with the use of muscle sparing, minimally invasive pedicle screw fixation.

AB OBJECTIVE: Posterior circulation strokes account for over one quarter of all ischemic strokes. The frequency of vertebral artery origin stenosis (VAOS) in patients with vertebrobasilar insufficiency (VBI) has been estimated to be as high 26%-32%, and VAOS is the direct cause of posterior circulation strokes in 9% of patients. This association could have a significant genetic component. This study examines the feasibility of the internal thoracic artery (ITA) as a donor vessel for revascularization in patients with VACS.
   METHODS: Ten sides from 5 fresh-frozen white cadaveric necks derived from 3 women and 2 men were used in this study. The mean age of the cadavers at death was 77.2 years (range, 68-88 years). The subclavian artery, vertebral artery, and ITA were dissected. The length and diameter (proximal and distal) of the V1 segment and the length and diameter of the ITA were recorded. Finally, the ITA was transposed to the V1 segment of the vertebral artery (VA1).
   RESULTS: The mean length of the VA1 and its diameter at the proximal and distal parts were 35.51 and 3.69 mm, respectively. The mean length and diameter of the ITA were 26.53 and 3.27 mm, respectively. Rerouting the ITA to the VA1 was feasible without tension on all sides.
   CONCLUSIONS: This study indicates that the ITA is anatomically and hemodynamically an excellent option for bypass surgery in a VACS scenario. We present convincing and reproducible data to aid neurosurgeons in choosing the procedure best suited to their patients.

AB BACKGROUND: With only 4 active certified neurosurgeons for a population of 50 million, neurosurgical care was seriously underdeveloped in Myanmar in 2012. Together with the local neurosurgical community, Swiss Neurosurgeons International started a program of assisted education with the aim of increasing the neurosurgical capacity to 60 active neurosurgeons by 2023.
   METHODS: Our program included a fully sponsored fellowship at an academic hospital in Switzerland for every Myanmar neurosurgeon in training to observe contemporary neurosurgery and the organization of regular workshops, lectures, and educational surgeries in Myanmar. Halfway through the program, we performed a survey to assess its benefits and shortcomings.
   RESULTS: In 2019, the number of active neurosurgeons in Myanmar had increased to 20, with 50 more in training. Intracranial pressure monitoring, cervical spine surgery, transsphenoidal surgery, and intraoperative electrophysiology have become established procedures. Our survey showed an increased interest by the residents in tumor and vascular surgery and a new interest in spinal surgery. The overall rating of the fellowship was "very good," with language barriers, cultural differences, and coping with inclement weather reported as the greatest difficulties.
   CONCLUSIONS: Since the start of our project in 2013, a series of contemporary neurosurgical technologies and procedures have been introduced to Myanmar with the help of Swiss Neurosurgeons International. Our survey results have shown the strong points of the ongoing educational program and the weaknesses to be addressed. Midway through our 10-year project, with an expanded and improved education program, our goal of 60 active neurosurgeons in Myanmar by 2023 seems well within reach.

TI One and Done: Multimodal Treatment of Pediatric Cerbral Arteriovenous

   EXPERIENCE; RESECTION; MICROSURGERY; MANAGEMENT; INCREASE
AB BACKGROUND: Brain arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) are complex vascular lesions composed of abnormal arteries directly connected to veins without the typical intervening angioarchitecture. Rupture rates range from 2% to 4%, with that risk increasing to 4.5% per year for those presenting with hemorrhage. Mortality ranges from 12% to 66.7% after rupture, and up to 40% of survivors suffer from permanent neurologic sequelae. Treatment commonly includes a multimodality approach consisting of a combination of microsurgery, embolization, and radiosurgery. Typically, preoperative embolization is undertaken in a staged manner several days to weeks prior to microsurgical resection.
   METHODS: We describe a series of 5 pediatric patients harboring intracranial AVMs who underwent embolization and resection in the same anesthetic event, an approach that has not yet been described in the literature.
   RESULTS: Three patients presented symptomatically, whereas 2 AVMs were discovered incidentally, and average Spetzler -Martin grade was 1.6. Average anesthesia length was 580.8 minutes, and intraoperative angiography revealed complete resection in all cases. All patients were extubated at the end of the case and were discharged and followed up with a modified Rankin Scale score of 0.
   CONCLUSIONS: We describe a novel approach to treatment of pediatric intracranial AVMs that is shown to be safe and feasible. A single anesthesia event allows for aggressive preoperative embolization without increasing the risk of hemorrhage in the waiting period until resection. A single anesthesia event also prevents the patients from undergoing another intubation and anesthesia and decreases the risk associated with another anesthesia in a relatively short time frame.

AB OBJECTIVE: In 2015, the Lancet Commission on Global Surgery highlighted the disparities in surgical care worldwide. The aim of the present study was to investigate the research productivity of low-income countries (LICs) and low- to middle-income countries (LMICs) in selected journals representing the worldwide neurosurgical data and their ability to report and communicate globally the existing differences between high-income countries (HICs) and LMICs.
   METHODS: We performed a retrospective bibliometric analysis using PubMed and Scopus databases to record all the reports from 2015 to 2017 by investigators affiliated with neurosurgical departments in LICs and LMICs.
   RESULTS: A total of 8459 reports by investigators self-identified as members of neurosurgery departments worldwide were identified. Of these, 6708 reports were included in accordance with our method in the final analysis. The systematic search resulted in 459 studies reported by LICs and LMICs. Of these, 334 reports were included for the full text evaluation. Of the 6708 reports, 303 (4.52%) had been reported with an LMIC affiliation and only 31 (0.46%) with an LIC. The leading countries were India with 182 (54.5% among LMICs and LICs; 2.71% overall), followed by Egypt at 66 (19.76% among the LMICs and LICs; 0.98% overall), with a large difference compared with other countries such as Uganda at 9 (2.69% among the LMICs and LICs) and Tunisia and Pakistan at 8 each (2.4% among the LMICs and LICs). A few reports studies had been generated by collaboration with HIC neurosurgeons.
   CONCLUSIONS: Our results have shown that research studies from LMICs are underrepresented. Understanding and discussing the reasons for this underrepresentation are necessary to start addressing the disparities in neurosurgical research and care capacity. Future engagements from international journals, more partnership collaboration from HICs, and tailored funding to support investigators, collaborations, and networks could be of help.

ID INDEPENDENT PREDICTORS; MANAGEMENT; REOPERATION; SURGERY
AB BACKGROUND: Most patients with bilateral chronic subdural hematomas (bCSDH) undergo initial bilateral evacuation. Risk factors associated with the recurrence of bCSDH after initial bilateral evacuation have not been published to date. In this study, we aimed to identify risk factors related to recurrence of bCSDH after initial bilateral evacuation, and to develop a prognostic grading system for clinical reference.
   METHODS: This study included 102 patients with bCSDH who underwent initial bilateral evacuation. Predictors of recurrence were identified via univariate analysis and multivariate logistic regression analysis. A prognostic grading system was created based on the independent predictors combined with a cutoff value. All cases were scored according to the prognostic grading system, and the recurrence rates of the different scores were reanalyzed.
   RESULTS: Anticoagulant use (odds ratio [OR], 84.266; 95% confidence interval [Cl], 13.113-541.522; P < 0.001), severe brain atrophy (OR, 11.551; 95% CI, 2.558-52.163; P = 0.001), and postoperative pneumocephalus volume (PostPV) (OR, 0.978; 95% CI, 0.957-1.000; P = 0.049) were independent risk factors for the recurrence of bCSDH after initial bilateral evacuation. The cutoff value of PostPV was >20.9484 cm(3). A prognostic grading system was then developed, and the recurrence rates based on score were determined. Rates were 2.8% for a score of 0-1, 28.1% for a score of 2-3, and 100% for a score of 4-5, showing a significant increase in risk with increasing score (P < 0.001).
   CONCLUSIONS: Anticoagulant use, severe brain atrophy, and PostPV were identified as independent risk factors for recurrence of bCSDH after initial bilateral evacuation. The prognostic grading system for recurrence of bCSDH after initial bilateral evacuation is reliable and applicable for clinical reference.

AB OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the clinical and radiographic outcomes of an anterior-only approach for the correction of severe cervical kyphotic deformities.
   METHODS: We performed a retrospective study of 33 consecutive patients with severe cervical kyphosis treated with an anterior cervical operation and preoperative and intraoperative skull traction. Cobb angle, kyphosis index (KI), kyphosis level, C2-7 sagittal vertical axis (SVA), and T1 slope were measured. The preoperative and postoperative Japanese Orthopedic Association (JOA) scores, visual analog scale (VAS) score for neck pain, Neck Disability Index (NDI) scores, and cervical alignment were compared.
   RESULTS: The mean angle of the kyphosis was 83.2 +/- 20 degrees. The mean Cobb angle of the operative region was 71.7 +/- 18.5 degrees preoperation, which was reduced to 10.6 +/- 5.7 degrees postoperation (mean correction, 85.2%). The mean KI was 75.1 +/- 18.2 preoperation, which was reduced to 14.4 +/- 9.1 postoperation (mean correction, 80.8%). The preoperative and postoperative mean C2-7 Cobb angle was 53.8 +/- 16.5 degrees and 14.7 +/- 7.6 degrees, respectively. The preoperative and postoperative mean C2-7 SVA was 3.9 + 14.5 mm and 12.8 +/- 7.3 mm, respectively. The preoperative and postoperative mean T1 slope was -9.4 +/- 15.7 degrees and 7.31 +/- 13.1 degrees, respectively. The average postoperative C2-7 Cobb angle, Cobb angle of the operative region, KI, C2-7 SVA, and T1 slope changed significantly compared with preoperative values (P < 0.05). The average postoperative JOA, VAS, and NDI scores improved significantly compared with preoperative scores (P < 0.05).
   CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative and intraoperative skull traction combined with anterior-only cervical operation may be a safe and effective technique for treating severe cervical kyphosis. If the postoperative correction is >80%, sufficient decompression could be achieved.

AB OBJECTIVE: Maximal safe resection prolongs the survival of patients with glioblastoma (GB). However, whether total resection of the enhanced lesion is pursued or abandoned depends on preoperative judgments based on the findings of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Anatomically, medial temporal tumor tends to invade toward the temporal stem, insula, and basal ganglia, representing tumor with high surgical risk. In the present study, we describe the key radiologic features of medial temporal GB to achieve extent of resection.
   METHODS: We reviewed all GB cases located in the temporal lobe (tGB) treated between April 2013 and March 2018 at Kitasato University Hospital. On the basis of MRI, tGB was simply classified into 3 groups: medial tGB and nonmedial tGB, and medial tGB was further subdivided into invading type and mimicking type. We focused on the resectability of medial tGB.
   RESULTS: Twenty-seven patients with tGB were identified. Twenty were included in the nonmedial tGB, and 7 were in the medial tGB. All medial tGB seemed to invade into the basal ganglia and/or the lenticulostriate arteries, but detailed examination revealed 2 types of tumor, invading type (3 cases) and mimicking type (4 cases). The invading type had true involvement of the basal ganglia and/or lenticulostriate arteries, whereas the mimicking type had no involvement of these structures. This new classification is highly effective, as the former is unresectable, but the latter is totally resectable.
   CONCLUSIONS: Medial tGB is a challenging tumor for maximal safe resection, so our classification will help to identify cases of removable medial tGB.

LA English
DT Article
DE Learning curve; Residency training; Robot-assisted spine surgery; Spinal
   navigation
AB OBJECTIVES: To describe the learning curve of pedicle screw placement using robot-assisted spine surgery of an experienced neurosurgeon and 2 supervised neurosurgical fellows.
   METHODS: The first 120 cases of robot-assisted spine surgery at our institution were assessed. Patient variables included age, body mass index, and indication for surgery. lntraoperative variables included the vertebral level of screw placement, number of screws placed by each operator, intraoperative blood loss, and operative time. Postoperative variables included length of stay, discharge disposition, 30-day readmissions, wound complications, and hardware revisions. Screw accuracy was determined with image overlay analysis comparing planned screw trajectory on the navigation software with the intraoperative computed tomography scan with final screw placement. Two-dimensional accuracy was determined for the tip of the screw, tail of the screw, and angle at the screw was placed. The supervising physician and first fellow began utilizing the robot concurrently upon its arrival, and the second fellow began using the robot after the system had been in place for 7 months.
   RESULTS: Both experienced surgeon and first fellow displayed a learning curve and achieved statistically significant improvement of accuracy after 30 screws. The second fellow had significantly better accuracy than the experienced surgeon in his first 30 screws. There were no complications from hardware placement in either group. There were no returns to the operating room for hardware issues.
   CONCLUSIONS: Robot-assisted spine surgery is a safe, accurate method of pedicle screw instrumentation. Our data show similar learning adaptation rates for the first fellow and the experienced surgeon. Techniques learned by the attending surgeon were immediately transferable to a new learner, who was able to achieve a faster learning curve than both the first fellow and the experienced surgeon.

AB OBJECTIVE: We investigated the ability of early alteration of cerebral perfusion-computed tomography (PCT) parameters to predict the risk of vasospasm, delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI), and clinical outcome in patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH).
   METHODS: A retrospective cohort study of 38 aSAH patients investigated with PCT within 48 hours after hemorrhage. Cerebral blood flow (CBF), cerebral blood volume, and mean transit time (MIT) values were recorded. Mean values were compared with clinical data. Vasospasm and DCI were determined by imaging and clinical criteria. Neurologic outcome was assessed by the modified Rankin Scale at discharge and 1-year follow-up visit.
   RESULTS: More than a third (39.5%) of patients developed DCI, of whom 86.7% presented moderate-severe vasospasm. There was a significant correlation between perfusion parameters in the early phase and occurrence of DCI and vasospasm. The occurrence of DCI and vasospasm correlated significantly with lower mean early PCT values. DCI was correlated with lower mean early CBF values (P = 0.049) and vasospasm with lower mean CBF (P = 0.01) and MTT (P< 0.00001) values. MIT values of 5.5s were shown to have 94% specificity and 100% sensitivity for predicting the risk of developing vasospasm.
   The severity of the SAH according to the Barrow Neurological Institute scale correlated significantly with the risk of developing DCI and vasospasm, both significantly associated with unfavorable neurologic outcome (modified Rankin Scale score 3-6) (P = 0.0002 and P = 0.02, respectively).
   CONCLUSIONS: Early alterations in PCT parameters and high Barrow Neurological Institute grade may identify a subgroup of patients at high risk of developing DCI and vasospasm after aSAH, thus prompting more robust preventative measures and treatment in this subgroup.

AB OBJECTIVE: To assess outcomes in obese patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) who sustained an osteoporotic vertebral compression fracture (OVCF) treated by percutaneous vertebroplasty (PVP) in the improved prone position and right lateral position.
   METHODS: Between January 2015 and May 2016, a total of 60 patients were enrolled in this randomized controlled study. Patients in group A were placed in the improved prone position for a bilateral transpedicular technique, and those in group B were placed in the right lateral position for a left transverse process-pedicle approach. Clinical and radiologic outcomes were assessed and compared between the 2 groups during the 12-month follow-up period.
   RESULTS: All operations were successfully completed without any serious sequelae. The operation time, fluoroscopic time, scores for respiratory condition during the operation, intravertebral cement volume, and incidence of cement leakage were significantly greater in group A compared with group B (P < 0.01). During the follow-up period, all patients in both groups experienced significant improvement in pain relief. Satisfactory functional improvement was obtained at 3 months postoperatively.
   CONCLUSIONS: Treatment of obese patients with COPD suffering from painful OVCF by PUP in both the improved prone position with a bilateral technique and the right lateral position with a unilateral technique was relatively safe and effective. However, unilateral PVP in the right lateral position was associated with a shorter operation time, limited fluoroscopic time, and minimal cement leakage.

AB OBJECTIVE: Endovascular treatment (EVT) is a promising clinical technology. However, some patients with posterior circulation stroke might not experience neurological function recovery after EVT. We reviewed the recent experience with EVT to clarify the clinical and radiographic factors that contribute to optimal neurological outcomes.
   METHODS: We analyzed the data from 108 consecutive patients with acute posterior circulation stroke who had undergone EVT from January 2016 to December 2018. A favorable outcome was defined as a modified Rankin scale score of 0-3 at 3 months. We evaluated the association and predictive value of the clinical and radiographic factors that contribute to good neurological outcomes.
   RESULTS: Of the 108 included patients, 43 had a favorable clinical outcome at day 90. Univariate analysis revealed a significant association between the 90-day favorable outcome and the baseline values of systolic blood pressure, time of stroke onset, contrast extravasation, symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage, general anesthesia, Alberta stroke program early computed tomography score for the posterior circulation, and the National Institutes of Health stroke scale (NIHSS) score. Contrast extravasation (odds ratio [OR], 5.094; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.22-21.261), symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (OR, 11.24; 95% CI, 1.309-96.517), general anesthesia (OR, 5.094; 95% CI, 1.22-21.26), and baseline NIHSS score (OR, 1.087; 95% CI, 1.023-1.309) were found to be independent predictors of a favorable outcome at day 90. Contrast extravasation alone predicted for unfavorable clinical outcomes and mortality with high specificity.
   CONCLUSION: In the present retrospective case series, contrast extravasation, symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage, the use of general anesthesia, and baseline NIHSS score were related to a favorable prognosis for patients with posterior circulation stroke after EVT. Contrast extravasation was an independent and strong predictor of unfavorable clinical outcomes.

AB OBJECTIVE: To compare and evaluate the efficacy and safety of nonstructural versus structural interbody fusion, using a combination of autograft and allograft bone for treatment of single segment thoracic and lumbar spinal tuberculosis (TB) via a posterior-only approach.
   METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 37 patients who were surgically treated in our department for thoracic and lumbar spinal TB between March 2015 and March 2018 and met our inclusion criteria. Eighteen of these 37 patients underwent nonstructural interbody fusion (group A), whereas the other 19 underwent structural interbody fusion with the aid of titanium mesh cages (group B). We compared and analyzed visual analog scale scores, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, blood loss, operation time, bone fusion rates, and correction angles.
   RESULTS: The average duration of follow-up was 20.33 +/- 4.73 months (range, 12-26 months) in group A and 19.63 +/- 4.63 months (range, 12-26 months), in group B. All patients showed significant improvement in neurologic function by 1 or 2 grades. Bone fusion was achieved in all patients, with no statistically significant difference between the 2 groups (P > 0.05). However, there were significant between-group differences in operation time (mean, 196.28 +/- 43.49 minutes [range, 128-300 minutes] in group A vs. 223.26 +/- 46.34 minutes [range, 150-300 minutes] in group B; P < 0.05) and estimated blood loss (mean, 474.44 +/- 224.37 mL [range, 200-900 mL] in group A vs. 585.79 +/- 378.82 mL [range, 200-1500] in group B; P < 0.05).
   CONCLUSION: The 2 surgical techniques may well have achieved similar results in terms of decreasing bone fusion time, improving neurologic function, and correcting kyphotic angles. However, the nonstructural interbody fusion technique exhibited less blood loss and faster operation time, and thus could serve as an alternative surgical technique for treatment of single-segment thoracic and lumbar spinal TB.

AB BACKGROUND: Nearly 20% of individuals with an aneurysm will have multiple aneurysms-these individuals are at increased risk of subarachnoid hemorrhage. Treatment of bilateral aneurysms with flow diverters (FDs), or Pipeline embolization device, has not yet been established as an effective therapy. We evaluated the safety and efficacy of a 2-stage treatment of bilateral aneurysms with Pipeline embolization devices placed 6 months apart.
   METHODS: We performed a retrospective review to analyze the clinical and angiographic outcomes of 16 individuals with bilateral aneurysms treated with 2-stage flow diversion at a tertiary referral center from January 2010 to July 2018.
   RESULTS: Of the 16 patients with 33 aneurysms treated with bilateral flow diversion, 1 had 2 aneurysms treated with a single FD on the contralateral side. The aneurysms treated were ophthalmic, superior hypophyseal, posterior communicating, or cavernous segment aneurysms, with an average size of 6.5 mm. No major complications, such as in-stent stenosis, thromboembolic events, distal intraparenchymal hemorrhage, rerupture, stent migration, or neurological death, were recorded. All the patients had good functional outcomes. At the 24-month follow-up examination, 81% of aneurysms showed complete occlusion. No aneurysm required repeat treatment.
   CONCLUSIONS: The results from the present study have demonstrated that 2-stage treatment of bilateral aneurysms with FDs is both safe and efficacious. The timing of contralateral FD stent placement is critical. We found that 6 months allows for adequate neurological recovery and stent endothelialization.

AB INTRODUCTION: Pivotal trials have shown the tremendous efficacy of mechanical thrombectomy in proximal occlusions. However distal occlusions involving second-order branches of the middle cerebral artery and beyond, anterior cerebral and posterior cerebral arteries were not represented. In this study, we investigated the feasibility and safety of distal circulation mechanical thrombectomy.
   METHODS: A retrospective review of patients presenting with distal circulation acute ischemic stroke who underwent mechanical thrombectomy 2010 and 2018.
   RESULTS: Of 453 patients who underwent mechanical thrombectomy for acute ischemic stroke, 76 had a distal occlusion. The mean National Institute Health Stroke Scale on admission was 12. Vessels involved included second-order branches of the middle cerebral artery (89%), third-and fourth-order branches of the middle cerebral artery (5%), second-order branch of the anterior cerebral artery (3%), and posterior cerebral artery (3%). Most procedures required 1 pass to recanalize the vessel (55%, n = 42). Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction score >= Ilb was achieved in 89% of subjects. Mortality rate was 8% and independent functional outcome of m Rankin score <= 2 at 3 months was seen in 643% with clinical follow-up. On multivariate analysis, distal circulation had a significantly shorter length of stay by about 2 days, compared with proximal circulation. Subjects with proximal occlusion were more than 5 times more likely to have a good Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction score compared with the distal group. There was no significant difference in periprocedural and postprocedural complications, good functional outcome at 3 months, and mortality between both groups.
   CONCLUSIONS: Mechanical thrombectomy procedure for distal circulation strokes is as effective and safe as a proximal group. Though distal vessels supply smaller brain area; however, when symptoms are pronounced, the benefit of the procedure outweighs the risks.

AB BACKGROUND: There has been no effective method to predict ischemic intolerance to temporary internal carotid artery (ICA) occlusion during carotid artery reconstruction. Pencil beam presaturation (BeamSAT) pulse suppresses the flow signal of the target vessel in magnetic resonance angiography (MRA). Applying this method, we constructed ICA-selective MRA images. The aim of this study was to identify patients at risk for ischemic intolerance by ICA-selective MRA.
   METHODS: By evaluating flow of anterior communicating artery (Acom) and A1 portion of anterior cerebral artery with ICA-selective MRA and posterior communicating artery (Pcom) with conventional MRA, we investigated associations of these collateral flow patterns with ischemic intolerance and decrease of regional cerebral oxygen saturation.
   RESULTS: The study included 58 patients who underwent carotid endarterectomy or carotid artery stenting. Six of 7 patients without Acorn flow and Pcom flow demonstrated ischemic intolerance, whereas all patients (n = 51) with Acom and/or Pcom flow demonstrated tolerance. The accuracy of this prediction model according to Acom and Pcom flow patterns for ischemic intolerance was 0.98 (P = 0.01, binomial test). Regional cerebral oxygen saturation decrease after ICA occlusion was significantly larger in patients without Acom flow and Pcom flow (12.0% +/- 6.0%) than in patients with Acom flow and Pcom flow (3.0% +/- 3.1%, P< 0.01) and in patients with Acorn flow but no Pcom flow (2.4% +/- 5.2%, P< 0.01).
   CONCLUSIONS: These findings support the importance of Acorn flow as a collateral route. ICA-selective MRA enables prediction of ischemic intolerance to temporary ICA occlusion during carotid endarterectomy or carotid artery stenting. This method provides valuable information regarding probability of an ischemic complication.

   CARE; GUIDELINES; CONTINUITY
AB BACKGROUND: Aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH) requires complex multidisciplinary care. After initial treatment (index hospital), readmission to a different hospital (nonindex) can compromise quality of care, resulting in increased morbidity. We aimed to evaluate factors associated with nonindex readmission and evaluate association of nonindex hospital readmission on outcomes in patients with ruptured aneurysm.
   METHODS: Readmissions within 90 days after aSAH treatment were identified in the 2010-2014 Nationwide Readmissions Database. Multivariable logistic regression identified patient and hospital characteristics associated with nonindex readmission. Separate multivariable models determined increased morbidity or risk of second readmission for nonindex readmissions.
   RESULTS: A total of 9254 patients who underwent treatment of ruptured aneurysms from 2010 to 2014 were identified. Of these, 1985 (21.5%) were readmitted within 90 days. Three hundred and fifty-five of these readmissions (17.9%) occurred to nonindex hospitals. Patients that were discharged to a skilled nursing or other facility (odds ratio [OR] 1.70; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.27-2.28]) had higher odds of nonindex readmission, whereas patients with private insurance were associated with lower odds of nonindex readmission (OR, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.46-0.92). Patients readmitted to a nonindex (vs. index) hospital were associated with increased likelihood of major complications (OR, 1.71; 95% CI, 1.18-2.48) and second readmissions (OR, 1.51; 95% CI, 1.17-1.96).
   CONCLUSIONS: After treatment of a ruptured cerebral aneurysm, 17.9% of readmissions occurred at a nonindex hospital. These patients were at increased risk for major complications or subsequent readmissions, which may be because of care fragmentation. Interventions aimed at improving continuity of care may reduce higher morbidity associated with nonindex readmission.

ID GROWTH; CANCER; MANAGEMENT; INHIBITOR; CARCINOMA; INVASION
AB BACKGROUND: We previously found that AFAP1-AS1 regulates the cell growth of pituitary tumor cells; however, the mechanism still remains unclear. Here, we investigated whether AFAP1-AS1 acts as a competing endogenous RNA of miR-103a-3p to regulate pituitary adenoma growth via the PI3K/AKT pathway.
   METHODS: The bind between AFAP1-AS1 and rno-miR-103a-3p was measured by luciferase reporter assay, and rno-miR-103a-3p expression was measured by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Proliferation, cell cycle, and apoptosis were measured by cell counting kit 8 and flow cytometry. Rat growth hormone (GH) and prolactin (PRL) levels in culture supernatant of GH3 and MMQ cells were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.
   RESULTS: AFAP1-AS1 binds to rno-miR-103a-3p in rat pituitary adenoma cells. Additionally, rno-miR-103a-3p overexpression suppressed rat pituitary adenoma cell proliferation, induced cell apoptosis, arrested cell cycle in the G/S phase, reduced GH and PLR secretion, and inhibited the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. Activated PI3K/AKT signaling pathway revised the effect of rno-miR-103a-3p overexpression on proliferation and GH and PLR secretion. Coexpression of both si-AFAP1-AS1 and rno-miR-103a-3p inhibitor promoted cell proliferation and cell cycle progression, reduced cell apoptosis, enhanced GH and PLR secretion, and activated the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway in rat pituitary adenoma cells.
   CONCLUSION: We found that AFAP1-AS1 and miR-103a-3p could be a potential therapeutic target for pituitary adenoma.

ID ASSISTED BRAIN SURGERY; TRIAL ISAT; SYSTEM
AB OBJECTIVE: Considerable effort has been made in order to reduce surgical invasiveness while maintaining optimal exploiting of the operative space in aneurysm surgery. One aspect of this evolution is represented by the Lazic (Peter Lazic GmbH, Tuttlingen, Germany) aneurysm clip system. The purpose of this study was to illustrate the new generation clip system in practiced aneurysm surgery.
   METHODS: A retrospective analysis of all aneurysm surgeries in our departments between December 2015 and January 2018 using the new D-Clip system was performed. Evaluation included standardized retrospective review of the main surgeon, the nursing staff, as well as an analysis of surgical video documentation by objective reviewers.
   RESULTS: Forty-five patients with 50 intracranial aneurysms underwent surgical clipping using the D-Clip system. A total of 64 permanent and 19 temporary D-Clips were applied. Nine clips needed to be replaced. All aneurysms could be occluded totally. Surgeons considered handling and manoeuvrability of clip application as feasible and good in all cases (100%), even under impaired visibility circumstances (14%). Objective video analysis revealed comparable results. Nursing staff scored handling and practicability of D-Clips equivalent to the preceding L-Clip generation. There were no intra-operative complications. Surgery-related postoperative morbidity was 6.7%.
   CONCLUSIONS: The new D-Clip system combines an attenuated design for minimally invasive clipping procedures with traditional mechanisms of common clip systems. It therefore appears to be highly versatile in the context of variable different aneurysm morphologies and locations while maintaining high standard surgical safety and efficacy.

AB OBJECTIVE: To analyze the safety and efficacy of skipping instrumentation at the C7 vertebra during posterior cervicothoracic fusions.
   METHODS: This is a retrospective chart review of 53 patients who underwent multilevel posterior cervical fusion between 2010 and 2015. of 53 patients, 7 patients were instrumented at C7, serving as the control group, whereas the remaining 46 patients were not. Evaluation of efficacy was based on intraoperative complications, operative time, estimated blood loss, significant long-term complications, and radiographic evidence of fusion.
   RESULTS: Skipping the C7 level resulted in a significant reduction in estimated blood loss (321 +/- 214 mL in the C7 bridge group vs. 531 +/- 365 mL in the control group) and an insignificant, but decreased, reduction in operative time (155 +/- 70 minutes in the C7 bridge group vs. 194 +/- 66 minutes in the control group). Two intraoperative complications were noted in the C7 group, and 1 intraoperative complication was noted in the control group. In addition, patients skipped at C7 maintained sagittal balance with fusion rates similar to control patients at follow-up. No significant long-term complications were found in both groups.
   CONCLUSIONS: Skipping C7 in a multilevel posterior cervicothoracic fusion demonstrates significantly reduced estimated blood loss and faster operative times compared with the control group. In addition, postoperative assessment yielded similar rates of fusion in both groups. Serious negative outcomes of skipping C7 were not found in this retrospective study. Our study results illustrate the clinical benefits of skipping instrumentation at C7 to minimize surgical risk in patients undergoing posterior cervical fusion across the cervicothoracic junction.

AB BACKGROUND: In endovascular treatment for cerebral aneurysms, the appearance of asymptomatic thromboembolic lesions detected by postprocedural diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) can be a surrogate marker for estimating the potential risk of symptomatic thromboembolism. The aim of this study was to clarify factors associated with postprocedural DWI-positive lesions in endovascular treatment for unruptured cerebral aneurysms.
   METHODS: Patients with untreated unruptured cerebral aneurysms undergoing endovascular treatment were consecutively enrolled. Treatment techniques were classified into simple coiling, balloon-assisted coiling, stent-assisted coiling, and flow-diverter placement. Head magnetic resonance imaging was performed within 3 months before and 24 hours after the procedure to assess the appearance of DWI-positive lesions.
   RESULTS: Among 376 aneurysms in 355 patients that were analyzed, 232 (61.7%) had postprocedural DWI-positive lesions. In univariate analyses, age (P = 0.001), dome size (P < 0.001), neck size (P < 0.001), treatment technique (P = 0.029), and total procedural time (P < 0.001) were significantly associated with postprocedural DWI-positive lesions. In the multiple logistic regression model, older age (odds ratio, 1.33; 95% confidence interval, 1.10-1.60; P = 0.003; per decade), flow-diverter placement (odds ratio, 4.93; 95% confidence interval, 1.33-20.92; P = 0.016; compared with simple coiling), and longer procedural time (odds ratio, 1.66; 95% confidence interval, 1.26-2.21; P < 0.001; per hour) were associated with postprocedural DWI-positive lesions.
   CONCLUSIONS: Older age, flow-diverter placement, and longer procedural time were associated with postprocedural DWI-positive lesions in endovascular treatment for unruptured cerebral aneurysms.

AB BACKGROUND: The development of endovascular techniques has offered extraordinary therapeutic opportunities to treat intracranial aneurysms. However, mainly for anterior circulation aneurysms, no clear superiority of these techniques compared with microsurgical clipping has been shown in terms of morbidity, mortality, aneurysm occlusion rate, and long-term protection from recanalization and rebleeding. We reviewed the data from a retrospective case series to determine the clinical and radiological outcomes of clipped ruptured and unruptured aneurysm to analyze the relationship between increasing surgical experience and operative time, recovery time, and clinical outcomes.
   METHODS: A total of 250 consecutive aneurysms in 221 patients had been treated from June 2009 to June 2015. The postoperative complications, recovery time (only for the unruptured group), operative time, clinical outcomes, and aneurysm occlusion rate at 3 months were analyzed for both ruptured and unruptured aneurysms. Linear regression was used to analyze the relationship between surgical experience and the operative time, recovery time, and clinical outcomes.
   RESULTS: The complication rate was very low in the unruptured cases (117 patients), with 100% of patients in good clinical status at 3 months. In the ruptured cases (104 patients), the presenting neurological status significantly influenced the postoperative outcomes. Complete obliteration found on the 3-month digital subtraction angiogram was obtained for 96.6% of the treated aneurysms in both groups. A significant correlation was found between surgical experience and both the operative time and recovery time.
   CONCLUSIONS: In a subset of patients (aneurysm located in the anterior circulation and <12 mm), microsurgical clipping appeared to be as safe as endovascular treatment and can obtain a very high complete occlusion rate. Increasing surgical experience improved the operative time and recovery time, with a trend toward improvement of the clinical outcomes.

ID BRAIN-TUMORS; DIAGNOSIS
AB BACKGROUND: Brain tumors are frequent in clinical practice and associated with high morbidity and mortality. However, many diseases can present as tumefactive lesions and mimic neoplastic lesions. We aimed to determine the frequency of pseudotumoral central nervous system lesions referred to an oncology center and the frequency of the tumor mimickers.
   METHODS: This was a retrospective study at the National Institute of Cancer, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Medical charts of patients admitted to the Neurosurgery and Pediatrics services from 2007 to 2011 were reviewed. Clinical and radiologic features of cases initially diagnosed with primary central nervous system tumors but received a final diagnosis of pseudotumoral disease were recorded.
   RESULTS: Among 891 patients referred as primary brain tumors, 38 cases had pseudotumoral lesions (4.3%). Most were adults (63%), with mean age of 29.4 years, and women (60.5%). Most frequent symptoms were headache (28.9%), motor signs (23.7%), and seizures (15.8%). Mean time from initial symptoms to diagnosis was 12.2 months. Lesions were single in 84.2% of patients, had contrast enhancement in 45.6%, and surrounding edema in 17.4%. Twenty patients (52,6%) underwent biopsy. Systemic autoimmune diseases were the most frequent etiologies (28.9%), followed by idiopathic inflammatory demyelinating diseases, infections, and vascular abnormalities (15.8% each). Good outcome with no major deficits was observed in 60.5% cases.
   CONCLUSIONS: The frequency of pseudotumoral lesions in an oncology reference center was low. Young women were most affected, and lesions were associated more frequently with systemic autoimmune diseases. Prompt recognition is important to avoid unnecessary treatment, because most patients had a good outcome.

AB OBJECTIVE: To report the outcomes of severe kyphoscoliosis secondary to ankylosing spondylitis (AS) corrected with 3D-printed individualized guiding templates.
   METHODS: Computed tomography (CT) data of patients with severe kyphoscoliosis secondary to AS were used to reconstruct 3D models of the spine and to develop a surgical plan. An asymmetric wedge pedicle subtraction osteotomy (PSO) was simulated using medical computer design software. Before the actual surgery, continual surgical simulations were performed until the most suitable one was obtained, and personalized guiding templates were manufactured for the anticipated PSO. During operation, the osteotomy plane and trajectories for the pedicle screws were positioned by the designed patient-specific 3D-printed guiding templates.
   RESULTS: In this study, we reviewed 9 patients who underwent correction of kyphoscoliosis using a 3D-printed individualized guiding template and were followed for a median of 21.4 months (range, 9-36 months). The average correction at the site of osteotomy was 65.9 degrees. No patient experienced severe complications, such as misplaced pedicle screws or neurologic complications. At the last follow-up, no patient exhibited implant dysfunction on radiography.
   CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative surgical simulation using 3D-printed templates is a viable technique that enables surgery to meet both patient- and surgeon-specific requirements for correction of severe thoracolumbar kyphoscoliosis. These 3D-printed templates can guide the performance of planned PSO to provide functional restoration of severe kyphoscoliosis secondary to AS.

AB BACKGROUND: This study was aimed at evaluating the gene expression levels of 4 genes in the intracranial aneurysm wall and comparing them with extracranial arteries. The analysis was done using real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and immunohistochemistry (IHC). Also, a correlation of the differential genetic expression was done with various patient clinical and radiologic factors.
   METHODS: The quantitative assessment of ribonucleic acid levels was done with RT-PCR and was validated with IHC. The genes studied were collagen 1A2 (COL1A2), tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 4 (TIMP4), cathepsin B (CTSB), and alpha-1 antitrypsin (alpha-1 AT). The analysis was done on 24 aneurysm sacs and superficial temporal/occipital artery samples from patients undergoing surgical clipping.
   RESULTS: The mean fold change of COL1A2 in the aneurysm sample was 8.89, that of TIMP4 was 10.16, that of CTSB was 1.02, and that of alpha-1 ATwas 1.46 when compared with normal control vessel on PCR. On semiquantitative IHC, COL1A2 was 94.44%, alpha-1 AT was 77.8% overexpressed, CTSB was positive in 50%, and the expression of TIMP4 was 94.4% underexpressed in aneurysmal walls. There was no statistically significant correlation between patient profile and gene expression.
   CONCLUSIONS: On RT-PCR and IHC analysis, COL1A2and alpha-1 AT were overexpressed, CTSB was marginally overexpressed, and TIMP4 had equivocal expression in the aneurysmal sac when compared with the normal extracranial vessel. This is the first study of its kind in the Indian population with the largest sample size on live human patients.

   Total blood volume
ID HEMORRHAGE; VASOSPASM; ASSOCIATION; SCALES
AB BACKGROUND: The amount of blood detected on brain computed tomography scan is frequently used in prediction models for delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI) in patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH). These models, which include coarse grading scales to assess the amount of blood, have only moderate predictive value. Therefore, we aimed to develop a predictive model for DCI including automatically quantified total blood volume (TBV).
   METHODS: We included patients from a prospective aSAH registry. TBV was assessed with an automatic hemorrhage quantification algorithm. The outcome measure was clinical deterioration due to DCI. Clinical and radiologic variables were included in a logistic regression model The final model was selected by bootstrapped backward selection and internally validated by assessing the optimism-corrected R-2 value, c-statistic, and calibration plot. The c-statistic of the TBV model was compared with models that used the (modified) Fisher scale instead.
   RESULTS: We included 369 patients. After backward selection, only TBV was included in the final model. The internally validated R-2 value was 6%, and the c-statistic was 0.64. The c-statistic of the TBV model was higher than both the Fisher scale model (0.56; P < 0.001) and the modified Fisher scale model (0.58; P < 0.05).
   CONCLUSIONS: In our registry, only TBV independently predicted DCI. TBV discriminated better than the (modified) Fisher scale, but still had only moderate value for predicting DCI. Our findings suggest that other factors need to be identified to achieve better accuracy for predicting DCI.

   SURGERY
AB BACKGROUND: Ventriculoperitoneal shunt (VPS) placement is one of the most common neurosurgical procedures. VPSs are associated with high costs, which predominantly arise from relatively high complication and revision rates. It is reasonable to assume that revision rates in developing countries would be higher. In this study we report the single-institution revision rates and costs from a high-volume department in sub-Saharan Africa.
   METHODS: A pediatric neurosurgical database was studied in the extent of 5 years. The 30-day shunt failure rate, overall revision rate, and costs were calculated, and results were compared with previously published studies from developed countries.
   RESULTS: In the selected time period 1840 VPS surgeries were performed, of which 592 were shunt revisions (32.14%). The majority of revision surgeries was performed in the first year- 501 (representing 84.63%); second year, 64; third year, 21; fourth year, 6; and fifth year, 2. The overall shunt revision rate was 28.94% with a 30-day revision rate of 14.58%. During the course of the study, costs of VPS surgery, the shunt, and daily ward charges did not change significantly. The average total charge for VPS insertion was 60,000 KES (586 USD), VPS removal 30,000 KES (293 USD), and VPS revision 50,000 KES (489 USD).
   CONCLUSIONS: This retrospective study proves that VPSs, with their known complication risks, can be performed in a sub-Saharan missionary hospital with acceptable costs and results that are comparable with those achieved in some Western hospitals. Keys to those outcomes include high volume and a highly experienced team.

AB INTRODUCTION: Percutaneous kyphoplasty can offer pain relief and restoration of vertebral height immediately after the procedure; however, little is known about how many vertebrae recollapse during follow-up or why recollapse occurs. In the present study, we define recollapse of a treated vertebra, assess how common it is following percutaneous kyphoplasty, and investigate risk factors for the condition.
   METHODS: In total, 203 consecutive patients who underwent percutaneous kyphoplasty were reviewed after an average 12.7 months to assess what proportion of cementaugmented vertebrae had recollapsed. Potential risk factors for recollapse included age, gender, body weight, body height, body mass index, treated level, duration of symptoms, follow-up duration, preoperative T-scores, surgical approach, the intravertebral cleft, contact of polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) with endplates, cement volume, cement leakage, and midline vertebral body height. Stepwise multivariate linear regression was conducted to predict recollapse as quantified by midline vertebral height loss.
   RESULTS: Overall, 38.9% of the augmented vertebrae recollapsed. In the recollapse group, the average midline vertebral height ratio and kyphotic angles statistically significantly changed during follow-up (P < 0.05). Pain scores decreased immediately after percutaneous kyphoplasty and generally remained low at follow-up. Significant predictors of midline vertebral height loss at follow-up included presence of an intravertebral cleft, postoperative vertebral height, and non-PMMA-endplate-contact. Together, these factors accounted for 28% of the variability in midline height loss.
   CONCLUSIONS: Benefits of percutaneous kyphoplasty are partly offset by subsequent recollapse. Recollapse is greater if there is an intravertebral cleft, non-PMMAendplate-contact and an increase in the post vertebral height.

AB INTRODUCTION: The occipitalization of the atlas (OA) is always associated with multiplanar dislocation and olisthy of the C1 over C2 facets, which may change the anatomical relationship between the internal carotid artery (ICA) and the atlas. The purpose of this current study is to identify the location of the ICA relative to the anterior aspect of the atlas in patients with OA and define the clinical implications for screw placement.
   METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the computed tomography angiography data of 86 patients with OA and 86 control subjects. Several parameters were also measured to quantitatively evaluate the mutual relationship.
   RESULTS: In the OA group, 25.6% of ICAs were located in area 3 and 74.4% in area 2, whereas the percentages were 57.4% and 42.6%, respectively, in the control group. There were 73 (42.4%) ICAs in which the shortest distance between the dorsal surface of the ICA and the ventral cortex of the atlas was less than 4 mm in the OA group and only 50 (29.1%) in the control group. The ideal angulation of C1 screw trajectory was about 5 degrees more medial in the OA group than that in the control group (P < 0.01).
   CONCLUSIONS: The risk of ICA injury is much higher in OA patients than in non-OA patients during the C1 screw placement. A mean medial angulation about 20 degrees will permit a long and safe screw purchase, but should be individualized. We recommend careful preoperative computed tomography angiography evaluation in all patients before surgery.

AB OBJECTIVE: The purpose of the present study was to construct a nomogram for postoperative delirium (POD) after deep brain stimulation (DBS) surgery in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD).
   METHODS: The present study retrospectively enrolled 165 patients with PD who had undergone DBS surgery. The patients were assessed using the Confusion Assessment Method for the Intensive Care Unit and were divided into 2 groups: the delirium group and nondelirium group. The nomogram for POD after DBS surgery was constructed from the results of univariate analysis and multivariate logistic analysis of the influencing factors for POD after DBS surgery.
   RESULTS: Univariate analysis revealed that the preoperative length of stay and the presence of preoperative brain atrophy, preoperative pulmonary inflammation, and postoperative cerebral edema were statistically significant. The results from the nonmotor symptoms scale for PD, mini-mental state examination, PD sleep scale, and unified PD rating scale III were also statistically significant (P < 0.05). Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that the unified PD rating scale III (odds ratio [OR], 2.284; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.614-3.232), nonmotor symptoms scale for PD (OR, 8.191; 95% CI, 5.629-11.917), PD sleep scale (OR, 0.058; 95% CI, 0.05-0.067), preoperative length of stay (OR, 1.230; 95% CI, 1.053-1.437), and preoperative brain atrophy (OR, 3.912; 95% CI, 3.5-4.255) were independent factors that influenced the occurrence of POD after DBS surgery. A nomogram model was constructed using these indicators. The model predicted an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve after DBS surgery of 0.870 (95% CI, 0.808-0.918), sensitivity of 74.19%, and specificity of 91.54%.
   CONCLUSIONS: The present study has presented a reliable and useful nomogram that can accurately predict the occurrence of POD after DBS surgery in patients with PD. This tool is easy to use and could assist physicians during the therapeutic decision-making process.

DE DISCERN; Most viewed; Neurosurgery; Quality; Relevance; YouTube
ID INFORMATION
AB BACKGROUND: YouTube has rapidly become one of the most widely accessed educational platforms of our time. Over 1 billion hours of YouTube content are viewed every day, including neurosurgical videos. To date, there has never been a qualitative analysis of neurosurgical content on YouTube.
   METHODS: By evaluating the search interest of neurosurgical terms via Google Trends, we selected 8 search terms to assess on YouTube. For each term, we selected the top 20 videos, 10 when sorting by view count and 10 when sorting by relevance. Using the DISCERN criteria, we evaluated 131 unique YouTube videos to assess bias and overall educational quality. In addition, we categorized each video based on its intended utility and the credentials of the video's commentator. The number of views, average DISCERN scores, and bias scores were compared between search terms and between video categories.
   RESULTS: There were 131 unique and 29 duplicate videos. The videos received 143,538,363 combined views (1,104,141 average). The average video age was 4.6 years (range, 66 days to 12.5 years). The term "brain surgery" received the most total views (62,339,885), with an average DISCERN score of 1.65 overall and 2 for bias. The average DISCERN score was 2.02 overall and 2.39 for bias. There were 45 advertisements for either hospitals, physicians, or companies, totaling 18,052,873 views and averaging a DISCERN score of 2.04.
   CONCLUSIONS: YouTube is a frequently viewed but biased source for neurosurgical information. Advertisements are frequently disguised as educational material, and few videos provide references or sources for their information.

AB BACKGROUND: Low-grade gliomas (LGGs) are known to progress to glioblastoma (GBM), decreasing the chances of survival. The tumor necrosis factor receptor CD40 and its ligand CD40L have shown value as biomarkers for GBM. The present study evaluated the role of CD40/CD40L in LGG and GBM in differentiating isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) wild-type and IDH-mutant GBM.
   METHODS: The present study was based on patient-derived samples (74 grade II gliomas, 36 grade III gliomas, and 40 cases of GBM) and expression analysis using real-time polymerase chain reaction. Open-access data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and the strong cohorts of TCGA data sets "brain lower grade glioma" and "glioblastoma" were used to run the analysis on mRNA expression as a validation data set.
   RESULTS: We found that patients with LGG and CD40 overexpression experienced shorter progression-free survival (43 vs. 29 months; hazard ratio, 0.5715; P = 0.0262) and overall survival (116 vs. 54 months; hazard ratio, 0.3431; P < 0.0001). Consistently, relapsed grade II glioma showed greater CD40 expression compared with primary grade II glioma (P = 0.0028). Just as with LGG, CD40 was a negative marker for overall survival in GBM (12 vs. 10 months; hazard ratio, 0.5178; P = 0.0491). In this context, we found greater CD40 expression in IDH wild-type GBM than in IDH-mutant GBM. The data obtained from TCGA supported our findings, with similar results for PFS and OS in LGG and GBM. CD40L expression showed no correlation with the survival data.
   CONCLUSION: High CD40 expression showed a significant correlation with poor outcomes for both LGG and GBM and was overexpressed in IDH wild-type GBM.

AB BACKGROUND: Patients with hematologic disorders who present with subdural hematomas (SDH) present a surgical decision-making challenge. Because of intrinsic coagulopathy, platelet dysfunction, and immunosuppression, surgical intervention poses a unique set of risks.
   OBJECTIVE: To describe a clinical sample of patients with hematologic disorders and concurrent SDH, to compare baseline and outcome variables, including complication rates and survival, in surgical versus nonsurgical management, and to identify clinical variables that may predict outcomes.
   METHODS: A 12-year retrospective case-control study was carried out of 50 adult patients with hematologic malignancies and SDH. Patients underwent surgical evacuation for SDH. Controls did not. Outcomes included discharge disposition, Glasgow Outcome Scale score, 30-day mortality, and overall survival. Complications included seizure, reoperation, and readmission. A Fisher exact test or chi(2) analysis compared categorical variables; continuous outcomes were compared with a Student t test. A Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was performed and multivariable Cox logistic regression evaluated variables associated with overall mortality.
   RESULTS: Surgical and nonsurgical groups differed only by Glasgow Coma Scale score, with slightly lower Glasgow Coma Scale scores in the surgical group. Complication rates did not differ; however, the 30-day reoperation rate was 35% for the surgical cohort. Overall, seizure incidence was 18%, readmission was 30%, 30-day mortality was 38%, median survival was 140.5 days, and 75% had a Glasgow Outcome Scale score of 1-3 at censorship. Increased age, low hemoglobin levels, and low platelet levels were associated with increased risk of mortality.
   CONCLUSIONS: Low platelet and hemoglobin levels are consistent markers of poor prognosis and surgical intervention, either as a proxy of or as a cause for clinical deterioration, is associated with increased mortality risk.

AB OBJECTIVE: To create an available thoracic ossification of the ligamentum flavum (TOLF) score as a rudimentary predictor for the postoperative prognosis of TOLF.
   METHODS: A retrospective review was conducted for all patients with TOLF who received surgical decompression from April 2012 to February 2019. The TOLF score consists of 5 components, namely, the age at surgery (1-3 points), diabetes mellitus (1 point), preoperative duration of symptoms (1-2 points), spinal canal axial remnant area ratio (0-2 points), and intramedullary signal change on magnetic resonance imaging (1 point). The scores of all patients were calculated and analyzed for their correlation with the postoperative recovery ratio. In addition, intraoperative blood loss, urinary catheter indwelling time, cerebrospinal fluid leakage, and postoperative neurologic deterioration were also measured.
   RESULTS: A total of 64 patients were included. The mean TOLF score at the final follow-up was 4.6 points in the excellent group (20 patients), 5.0 points in the good group (29 patients), and 7.3 points in the poor group (15 patients). A higher TOLF score predicts lower postoperative recovery ratio (P = 0.000), longer urinary catheter indwelling time (P = 0.023), and higher incidence of postoperative neurologic deterioration (P = 0.000). However, no correlation was identified between the TOLF score and intraoperative blood loss (P = 0.755) or cerebrospinal fluid leakage (P = 0.911).
   CONCLUSIONS: The TOLF score is a novel and rudimentary scoring system that describes the predictive factors that indicate the postoperative prognosis of TOLF.

AB BACKGROUND: Juxtafacet cysts (JFCs) include both synovial and ganglion cysts adjacent to a spinal facet joint or arising from the ligamentum flavum of the spinal facet joints. Various treatments have been proposed; however, a surgical approach appears to be most effective. The aim of this study was to review patients with lumbar JFCs treated using a full endoscopic approach and elaborate the details of the surgical routes and techniques and their merits and pitfalls.
   METHODS: All patients with lumbar JFCs underwent complete endoscopic cyst removal. Muscle power, visual analog scale score, modified MacNab criteria score, and magnetic resonance imaging were assessed during follow-up.
   RESULTS: The study enrolled 8 patients. Five patients received an interlaminar approach, 2 patients received a transforaminal approach, and 1 patient received a transfacet approach. Visual analog scale scores decreased from a mean of 7.75 (range, 5-10) before surgery to 0.625 (range, 0-2) after surgery, and modified MacNab criteria score ranged from good to excellent after surgery. No neurologic injuries were observed.
   CONCLUSIONS: JFCs could be effectively treated by full endoscopic surgery. The type of approach should be based on the anatomic site of the lesion and the condition of the patient. The interlaminar approach is appropriate for cysts located in the lower segment with larger interlaminar space. The transforaminal or transfacet approach is preferred for patients for whom general anesthesia is a high risk.

AB BACKGROUND: Postinterventional sedation is commonly used in clinical practice to ensure patient safety and comfort. Although sedation or anesthesia during thrombectomy has been well studied, the association between postinterventional sedation and functional outcomes in endovascularly treated patients with acute ischemic stroke (AIS) has yet to be investigated. We describe the association between postinterventional sedation and functional outcomes in patients with AIS treated with endovascular therapy (EVT).
   METHODS: This observational study was based on a prospective registry. Patients with AIS treated with EVT from January 2013 to August 2017 at Xuanwu Hospital, Capital Medical University were included. Patients receiving postinterventional sedation were compared with patients not receiving sedation. The primary outcome was the 3 months modified Rankin Scale score.
   RESULTS: A total of 268 patients were eligible for study: 112 patients (41.8%) receiving postinterventional sedation and 156 patients (58.2%) without sedation. At 3 months follow-up, the median modified Rankin Scale score was 4 (interquartile range, 3-6) in the sedation group and 2 (interquartile range, 1-4) in the nonsedation group (P < 0.001). Multivariable regression analysis suggested that the need for postinterventional sedation was associated with unfavorable outcomes, with an odds ratio of 0.20 for functional independence (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.078-0.487; P < 0.901), 0.06 for freedom from disability (95% CI, 0.017 0/28, P < 0.001), and 8.37 for death (95% CI, 2.196-31.889; P = 0.002).
   CONCLUSIONS: Postinterventional sedation worsens functional outcomes in patients with AIS with large-vessel occlusions treated with EVT. Whether the sedation is a causative factor or a surrogate for poor functional outcomes remains to be determined.

AB BACKGROUND: Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), which visualizes white matter tracts, can be integrated to optimize intracranial radiation therapy (RT) and radiosurgery (RS) treatment planning. This study aimed to systematically review the integration of DTI for dose optimization in terms of evidence of dose improvement, clinical parameter changes, and clinical outcome in RT/RS treatment planning.
   METHODS: PubMed and Scopus electronic databases were searched based on the guidelines established by PRISMA to obtain studies investigating the integration of DTI in intracranial RT/RS treatment planning. References and citations from Google Scholar were also extracted. Eligible studies were extracted for information on changes in dose distribution, treatment parameters, and outcome after DTI integration.
   RESULTS: Eighteen studies were selected for inclusion with 406 patients (median study size, 19; range: 2-144). Dose distribution, with or without DTI integration, described changes of treatment parameters, and the reported outcome of treatment were compared in 12, 7, and 10 studies, respectively. Dose distributions after DTI integration improved in all studies. Delivery time or monitor unit was higher after integration. In studies with long-term follow-up (median, >12 months), neurologic deficits were significantly fewer in patients with DTI integration.
   CONCLUSIONS: Integrating DTI into RT/RS treatment planning improved dose distribution, with higher treatment delivery time or monitor unit as a potential drawback. Fewer neurologic deficits were found with DTI integration.

AB BACKGROUND: The epidemiology of patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI) has changed dramatically over recent decades as a result of rapid advances in aging societies. We assessed the influence of age on outcomes of patients with TBI and sought to identify prognostic factors for in-hospital mortality of TBI among elderly patients.
   METHODS: Using a nationwide database, we analyzed data from 5651 patients with TBI. Univariate analysis was conducted to compare patient demographics, neurologic status on admission, radiologic findings, systemic complication rates, length of hospital stay, in-hospital mortality, and home discharge rates between elderly and nonelderly groups. Multivariable analysis was conducted to determine prognostic factors for in-hospital mortality among elderly patients.
   RESULTS: Overall in-hospital mortality was significantly higher in elderly patients (12.8% vs. 19.3%; P < 0.001). Inhospital mortality of elderly patients with mild TBI increased significantly at >7 days after admission, whereas that of elderly patients with moderate or severe TBI was significantly higher immediately after admission. Age (odds ratio [OR], 1.62; P = 0.024), male sex (OR, 1.30; P = 0.004), Japan Coma Scale score on admission (OR, 5.95, P < 0.001), and incidence of acute subdural hematoma (OR, 1.89; P < 0.001) were associated with in-hospital mortality in elderly patients with TBI.
   CONCLUSIONS: Elderly patients with TBI showed significantly higher in-hospital mortality. Delayed increases in in-hospital mortality were observed among elderly patients with mild TBI. Level of consciousness on admission was the strongest predictor of in-hospital mortality among elderly patients.

TI Cauda Equina Occupation Ratio as a New Imaging Parameter for the

SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
LA English
DT Article
DE Cauda equina; Diagnosis; Magnetic resonance imaging; Occupation ratio;
   Spinal dural arteriovenous fistulae
ID CLINICAL-FEATURES; MALFORMATIONS; MRI; SURGERY
AB BACKGROUND: Because spinal dural arteriovenous fistulae (SDAVF) are rare and their clinical presentation is nonspecific, they are often overlooked during diagnostic evaluations. Typical magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings are intramedullary T2-weighted signal hyper-intensity and perimedullary flow voids. There are few reports on the characteristic signs of the cauda equina. We assessed the significance of a new imaging parameter, the cauda equina occupation ratio (CEOR), for the evaluation of SDAVF.
   METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the clinical charts and radiological findings of 20 SDAVF patients treated at our institutions. We evaluated sagittal T2-weighted MRI scans and assessed the CEOR, the occupation ratio of the cauda equina compared to the sagittal diameter of the corresponding lumbar spinal canal. The controls were 21 age- and sex-matched subjects.
   RESULTS: Of the 20 SDAVF, 10 were at the thoracic and 10 at the lumbar spine. There was no significant difference between the preoperative CEOR and the spinal level of the fistulae or the neurological signs. On preoperative MRI scans, the mean CEOR was 56.0 +/- 7.8; postoperatively, it was 37.1 +/- 7.4 (P = 0.000). The preoperative CEOR was significantly larger in SDAVF patients than in the controls (P = 0.000); postoperatively, it was smaller than in the controls (P = 0.14).
   CONCLUSIONS: The preoperative CEOR was larger in patients with SDAVF than in the controls. It normalized after successful occlusion of the fistula. Our findings indicate that the CEOR is a useful parameter for the pre-and postoperative evaluation of SDAVF.

AB OBJECTIVE: To screen ideal lead compounds from a drug library (ZINC15 database) with potential inhibition effect against O-6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) to contribute to medication design and refinement.
   METHODS: A series of computer-aided virtual screening techniques were used to identify potential inhibitors of MGMT. Structure-based virtual screening by LibDock was carried out to calculate LibDock scores, followed by absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion and toxicity predictions. Molecule docking was employed to demonstrate binding affinity and mechanism between the selected ligands and MGMT protein. Molecular dynamics simulation was performed to evaluate stability of the ligand-MGMT complex under natural circumstances.
   RESULTS: Two novel natural compounds, ZINC000008220033 and ZINC000001529323, from the ZINC15 database were found to bind with MGMT with a higher binding affinity together with more favorable interaction energy. Also, they were predicted to have less rodent carcinogenicity, Ames mutagenicity, and developmental toxicity potential as well as noninhibition with cytochrome P-450 2D6. Molecular dynamics simulation analysis demonstrated that the 2 complexes ZINC000008220033-MGMT and ZINC000001529323-MGMT had more favorable potential energy compared with reference ligand O-6-benzylguanine, and they could exist stably in the natural environment.
   CONCLUSIONS: This study elucidated that ZINC000008220033 and ZINC000001529323 were ideal lead compounds with potential inhibition targeting to MGMT protein. These compounds were selected as safe drug candidates and may contribute a solid basis for MGMT target medication design and improvement.

AB OBJECTIVE: Few studies have addressed the causes of poor expansion of the spinal canal after open-door laminoplasty (ODL) that require revision surgery. The aim of this study is to identify the reasons of poor expansion of the spinal canal after ODL and to discuss the surgical methods and clinical outcomes of the posterior revision surgery.
   METHODS: All patients who underwent posterior revision surgery because of poor expansion of the spinal canal after ODL were retrospectively reviewed at our spine center. Clinical data, radiologic findings, method of surgical revision, interval between surgeries, Japanese Orthopaedic Association (JOA) score, and complications were analyzed.
   RESULTS: We identified 16 patients that underwent posterior revision surgery because of poor expansion of the spinal canal after ODL. The main causes of poor expansion of the spinal canal included inadequate expansion degree of the spinal canal (75%, 12/16) and improper expansion range of the spinal canal (25%, 4/16). Revision surgery was performed with posterior ODL, laminectomy and fusion (LCF), or laminectomy of responsible lamina. The interval between the initial procedure and revision surgery was 72.2 months (range, 0.5-168 months). The mean JOA score was restored from 10.6 (range, 8-13) to 14.3 (range, 13-17) after the revision surgery.
   CONCLUSIONS: The main causes of poor expansion of the spinal canal after ODL were inadequate expansion degree of the spinal canal and improper expanded range of the spinal canal. Posterior revision surgeries, such as ODL, LCF, and laminectomy of responsible lamina, could guarantee fine clinical results.

AB OBJECTIVE: We sought to investigate the relationship nen cervical cord compression and factors related to whole-spine sagittal balance.
   METHODS: This retrospective single-center study Aided patients who visited our clinic for the evaluation of lumbar pathology including trauma and degeneration. Patients aged 60- 89 years who underwent whole-spine sagittal T2 scout magnetic resonance imaging and whole-spine radiograph between 2014 and 2018 were included in our study. We consecutively enrolled 100 patients for our study without any prejudice. We collected data on patient characteristics, diagnosis, cervical cord compression index (CCI), sagittal vertical axis (C7-81, C2-7), and other parameters related to sagittal balance such as pelvic incidence minus lumbar lordosis. Pearson correlation coefficients were calculated to compare CCI with each whole-spine sagittal balance parameter.
   RESULTS: Of the 100 patients, 44 were men. The mean u s e was 74.21 years. On the basis of Pearson correlation coefficients, CCI showed the strongest positive linear correlation with C7-S1 sagittal vertical axis (r = 0.688; P < 0.01), followed by the C2-7 sagittal vertical axis (r = 0.563; P < 0.01).
   CONCLUSIONS: Cervical cord compression is more likely to develop in patients with sagittal imbalance. It is important to use whole-spine T2 scout magnetic resonance imaging to analyze CCI in these patients.

AB BACKGROUND: The Michigan Spine Surgery improvement Collaborative is a statewide multicenter quality improvement registry. Because missing data can affect registry results, we used MSSIC to find demographic and surgical characteristics that affect the completion of patient-reported outcomes (PROs) at 90 days and 1 year.
   METHODS: A total of 24,404 patients who had lumbar surgery (17,813 patients) or cervical surgery (6591 patients) were included. Multivariate logistic regression models of patient disease were constructed to identify risk factors for failure to complete scheduled PRO surveys.
   RESULTS: Patients >= 65 years old and female patients were both more likely to respond at 90 days and 1 year. Increasing education was associated with greater response rate at 90 days and 1 year. Whites and African Americans had no differences in response rates. Calling provided the highest response rate at 90 days and 1 year. For cervical spine patients, only discharge to rehabilitation increased completion rates, at 90 days but not 1 year. For lumbar spine patients, spondylolisthesis or stenosis (vs. herniated disc) had a greater response rate at 1 year. Patients with leg (vs. back) pain had a greater response only at 1 year. Patients with multilevel surgery had an increased response at 1 year. Patients who underwent fusion were more likely to respond at 90 days, but not 1 year. Discharge to rehabilitation increased response at 90 days and 1 year.
   CONCLUSIONS: A multivariate analysis from a multi-center prospective database identified surgical factors that affect PRO follow-up, up to 1 year. This information can be helpful for imputing missing PRO data and could be used to strengthen data derived from large prospective databases.

ID IMPROVE; BRAIN
AB OBJECTIVE: To identify the potent metabolic biomarkers of cauda equina injury (CEI).
   METHODS: A total of 50 Sprague-Dawley rats were used to establish the CEI model in this study. The serum was collected at 12 hours, 1 day, 2 days, and 7 days after surgery. Ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry was performed to analyze metabolic changes in the serum of the CEI rats from different groups. The differences between the metabolic profiles of the rats in 5 groups were analyzed using partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA).
   RESULTS: Metabolic profiling revealed significant differences between the sham operated and other groups. A total of 57 potential CEI metabolite biomarkers were identified between the sham operated group and the model groups at the different time points. Principal component analysis and PLS-DA analyses revealed clear segregation between CEI versus sham operation group. These potential biomarkers appear in 15 metabolic pathways.
   CONCLUSIONS: Using metabolomic analysis, we were able to identify the novel serum biomarkers of CEI that may be relevant to the diagnosis and prognosis of CEI. In addition, our pathway analysis provides important insights into the etiology of CEI and a basis for clinical diagnosis, locating biomarkers in the early stages of the pathological process.

AB OBJECTIVE: Extradural subtemporal keyhole approach could provide adequate removal for some specific middle skull base tumors. The combination of endoscopy and keyhole technique might further help to minimize the complications and provide optimal surgical visualization , Here, a series of attempts with endoscopy by mini-invasive subtemporal extradural approach for 5 middle skull base tumors were successfully achieved.
   METHODS: From November 2015 to November 2018, resetions of 5 cases of middle cranial fossa tumors were performed with pure endoscopy via subtemporal extradural keyhole approach. Patient medical records, imaging data, surgical procedures, pathology results, and follow-up outcomes were collected and analyzed.
   RESULTS: Adequate extradural subtemporal space was successfully established for endoscopy, and tumor resection was performed. Postoperative pathology confirmed cholesteatoma, cholesterol granuloma, schwannoma, granuloma, and osteoblastoma, respectively. Two patients with osteoblastoma and granuloma received subtotal resection, and the other 3 achieved total resection. One patient suffered from brain edema and was relieved after systematic mannitol treatment. No other complications were observed, and no progression was found during follow-up.
   CONCLUSIONS: This exploratory series demonstrated safety and effectiveness of pure endoscopic surgery via subtemporal extradural route for satisfactory middle cranial base tumor resection.

AB OBJECTIVE: The present study aimed to develop and evaluate a nomogram for predicting the overall survival (OS) of patients with low-grade glioma (LGG).
   METHODS: Patients with LGG diagnosed from 1973 to 2013 were identified using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database. A total of 3732 patients were randomly divided into a training set (n = 2612) and a validation set (n = 1120). Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses of the clinical variables were performed to screen for significant prognostic factors. Next, a nomogram that included significant prognostic variables was formulated to predict for LGG. Harrell's concordance index (C-index) and calibration plots were formulated to evaluate the reliability and accuracy of the nomogram using bootstrapping according to the internal (training set) and external (validation set) validity.
   RESULTS: A nomogram was developed to predict the 5-and 9-year OS rates using 7 variables in the training set: age, tumor site, sex, marital status, histological type, tumor size, and surgery (P < 0.05). The C-index for internal validation, which the nomogram used to predict OS according to the training set, was 0.777 (range, 0.763-0.791), and the C-index for external validation (validation set) was 0.776 (range, 0.754-0.797). The results of the calibration plots showed that the actual observation and prediction values obtained by the nomogram had good consistency between the 2 sets.
   CONCLUSIONS: We have developed a ready-to-use nomogram model that includes clinical characteristics to predict OS. The nomogram might provide consultation and risk assessments for subsequent treatment of patients with LGG.

TI A Preliminary Investigation Report on Using Probabilistic Fiber

   REGION; IDENTIFICATION; ORGANIZATION; VALIDATION; CORTEX; NERVE
AB BACKGROUND: Diffusion tensor imaging is currently the only noninvasive way to map subcortical white matter tractography. Radiologists and neurologists often fail to reconstruct the complex auditory pathways when applying the most commonly used approach, deterministic fiber tracking, as this method is limited in spatial and angular resolution. A different fiber-tracking method involving a probabilistic approach could partly compensate for these limitations. We investigated efficiency and potential usefulness of probabilistic fiber tracking in depicting human auditory pathways in healthy individuals and patients with unilateral vestibular schwannoma (VS).
   METHODS: Eight healthy volunteers and 14 patients with unilateral VS underwent diffusion tensor imaging. Probabilistic fiber tracking of the auditory pathways for each subject was carried out using FSL software. Tracking rate, reliability of results, fiber volume, fiber length, and fractional anisotropy values were considered in assessing reliability and sensitivity of this method. Fiber length and fiber volume were analyzed separately for the healthy group and VS group.
   RESULTS: Good tracking sensitivity and consistency were shown in healthy subjects and patients with VS. For fiber length, the 8 healthy subjects exhibited significant between-sides differences, whereas the 14 patients with VS showed no such difference. For fiber volume, there was a statistically significant difference between groups, as the patients with VS displayed a smaller fiber volume on the nontumor side. Fractional anisotropy values revealed no significant autologous or between-group differences. These results match results of previous anatomic and neurologic studies.
   CONCLUSIONS: The auditory pathway can be depicted well by probabilistic fiber tracking. This method can compensate in part for weaknesses of the widely used deterministic tractography approach in depicting fine and complicated subcortical fibers.

AB OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of end plate morphology on cage subsidence and to compare the surgical outcomes among patients with different vertebral end plate morphologies.
   METHODS: We reviewed a series of consecutive patients from January 2009 to January 2016 who had undergone monosegment L4/5 transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion (TLIF) with a follow-up >2 years. The enrolled patients were divided into 3 groups based on the preoperative vertebral end plate morphology on T1-weighed sagittal magnetic resonance scans: concave group (C group), flat group (F group), and irregular group (Ir group). Lumbar lordosis (LL), segmental lordosis (SL), and disc height (DH) were measured on the plain image at each follow-up, and three-dimensional computed tomography (3D-CT) was obtained at 1 year follow-up to evaluate the cage subsidence and solid fusion.
   RESULTS: A total of 145 consecutive patients (41 males and 104 females) were included in this study, with a mean follow-up of 33.8 +/- 12.3 months. The age was significantly older in the Ir group than in the C group or F group (P < 0.05). Cage subsidence was detected in 23 patients (15.9%) at 1 year follow-up through 3D-CT. The incidence of cage subsidence was significantly higher in the Ir group than in the F group or C group (P < 0.05). Patients in the Ir group had significant loss of DH, SL, and LL at the latest follow-up, compared with those in the C group and F group (P < 0.05). Patients with cage subsidence had a significantly older age (P < 0.05). The presence of cage subsidence was associated with end plate morphology as shown by logistic regression analysis (P < 0.05). Before surgery, Oswestry Disability Index and visual analog scale back pain scores were significantly higher in the Ir group than in the C and F groups (P < 0.05). After surgery and until the latest follow-up, each group experienced significant improvement in contrast to preoperative scores regardless of end plate morphology (P < 0.05).
   CONCLUSIONS: Morphology of the end plate plays an important role in the development of cage subsidence after TLIF surgery. Fused segments with irregular end plates are prone to cage subsidence. Although cage subsidence does not affect short-term clinical outcomes, measures should be taken to prevent cage subsidence-related loss of SL and total LL.

AB Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) is becoming a method of choice for describing native conformations of biomolecular complexes at high resolution. The rapid growth of cryo-EM in recent years has created a high demand for automated solutions, both in hardware and software. Flexible fitting of atomic models to three-dimensional (3D) cryo-EM reconstructions by molecular dynamics (MD) simulation is a popular technique but often requires technical expertise in computer simulation. This work introduces cryo_fit, a package for the automatic flexible fitting of atomic models in cryo-EM maps using MD simulation. The package is integrated with the Phenix software suite. The module was designed to automate the multiple steps of MD simulation in a reproducible manner, as well as facilitate refinement and validation through Phenix. Through the use of cryo_fit, scientists with little experience in MD simulation can produce high quality atomic models automatically and better exploit the potential of cryo-EM.

They display a common protein fold and the same catalytic mechanism, yet have a stringent capacity to discriminate between their respective substrates.
   The MalDH/LDH superfamily is divided into several phylogenetically related groups. It has been shown that the canonical LDHs and LDH-like group of MalDHs are primarily tetrameric enzymes that diverged from a common ancestor. In order to gain understanding of the evolutionary history of the LDHs and MalDHs, the biochemical properties and crystallographic structure of the LDH-like MalDH from the hyperthermophilic archaeon Ignicoccus islandicus (I. isl) were determined. I. isl MalDH recognizes oxaloacetate as main substrate, but it is also able to use pyruvate. Surprisingly, with pyruvate, the enzymatic activity profile looks like that of allosteric LDHs, suggesting a hidden allosteric capacity in a MalDH. The I. isl MalDH tetrameric structure in the apo state is considerably different from those of canonical LDH-like MalDHs and LDHs, representing an alternative oligomeric organization. A comparison with MalDH and LDH counterparts provides strong evidence that the divergence between allosteric and non-allosteric members of the superfamily involves homologs with intermediate, atypical properties.

AB VEK50 is a truncated peptide from a Streptococcal pyogenes surface human plasminogen (hPg) binding M-protein (PAM). VEK50 contains the full A-domain of PAM, which is responsible for its low nanomolar binding to hPg. The interaction of VEK50 with kringle 2, the PAM-binding domain in hPg (K2(hPg)), has been studied by high-resolution NMR spectroscopy. The data show that each VEK50 monomer in solution contains two tight binding sites for K2(hPg), one each in the a1- (RH1; (RH18)-H-17) and a2- (RH2; (RH31)-H-30) repeats within the A-domain of VEK50. Two mutant forms of VEK50, viz., VEK50[RH1/AA] (VEK50(Delta RH1)) and VEK50[RH2/AA] (VEK50(Delta RH2)), were designed by replacing each RH with AA, thus eliminating one of the K2(hPg) binding sites within VEK50, and allowing separate study of each binding site. Using C-13- and N-15-labeled peptides, NMR-derived solution structures of VEK50 in its complex with K2(hPg) were solved. We conclude that the A-domain of PAM can accommodate two molecules of K2(hPg) docked within a short distance of each other, and the strength of the binding is slightly different for each site. The solution structure of the VEK50/K2(hPg), complex, which is a reductionist model of the PAM/hPg complex, provides insights for the binding mechanism of PAM to a host protein, a process that is critical to S. pyogenes virulence.

AB Sticholysin I (StI) is a toxin produced by the sea anemone Stichodactyla helianthus and belonging to the actinoporins family. Upon binding to sphingomyelin-containing membranes StI forms oligomeric pores, thereby leading to cell death. According to recent controversial experimental evidences, the pore architecture of actinoporins is a debated topic. Here, we investigated the StI topology in membranes by site-directed spin labeling and electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy. The results reveal that StI in membrane exhibits an oligomeric architecture with heterogeneous stoichiometry of predominantly eight or nine protomers, according to the available structural models. The StI topology resembles the conic pore structure reported for the actinoporin fragaceatoxin C. Our data show that StI coexists in two membrane-associated conformations, with the N-terminal segment either attached to the protein core or inserted in the membrane forming the pore. This finding suggests a 'pre-pore' to 'pore' transition determined by a conformational change that detaches the N-terminal segment.

AB Gram-negative bacteria evade the attack of cationic antimicrobial peptides through modifying their lipid A structure in their outer membranes with 4-amino-4-deoxy-L-arabinose (Ara4N). ArnA is a crucial enzyme in the lipid A modification pathway and its deletion abolishes the polymyxin resistance of gram-negative bacteria. Previous studies by X-ray crystallography have shown that full-length ArnA forms a three-bladed propeller-shaped hexamer. Here, the structures of ArnA determined by cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) reveal that ArnA exists in two 3D architectures, hexamer and tetramer. This is the first observation of a tetrameric ArnA. The hexameric cryo-EM structure is similar to previous crystal structures but shows differences in domain movements and conformational changes. We propose that ArnA oligomeric states are in a dynamic equilibrium, where the hexamer state is energetically more favorable, and its domain movements are important for cooperating with downstream enzymes in the lipid A-Ara4N modification pathway. The results provide us with new possibilities to explore inhibitors targeting ArnA.

AB Zinc metallopeptidases of the M1 family (M1 peptidases) with unique metal binding motif HEXXH(X)(18)E regulate many important biological processes such as tumor growth, angiogenesis, hormone regulation, and immune cell development. Typically, these enzymes exist in three-domain [N-terminal domain (N-domain), catalytic domain, and C-terminal domain (C-domain)] or four-domain (N-domain, catalytic domain, middle domain, and C-domain) format in which N-domain and catalytic domain are more conserved. The C-domain plays important roles in substrate binding and gating. In this study we report the first structure of a two-domain (N-domain and catalytic domain) M1 peptidase at 2.05 angstrom resolution. Despite the lack of C-domain, the enzyme is active and prefers peptide substrates with large hydrophobic N-terminal residues. Its substrate-bound structure was determined at 1.9 angstrom resolution. Structural analyses supported by site directed mutagenesis and molecular dynamics simulations reveal structural features that could compensate for the lack of C-domain. A unique loop insertion (loop A) in the N-domain has important roles in gating and desolvation of active site. Three Arg residues of the catalytic domain are involved in substrate-binding roles typically played by positively charged residues of C-domain in other M1 peptidases. Further, its unique exopeptidase sequence motif, LALET, creates a more hydrophobic environment at the S1 subsite (which binds N-terminal residue of the substrate in aminopeptidases) than the more common GXMEN motif in the family. This leads to high affinity for large hydrophobic residues in the S1 subsite, which contributes towards efficient substrate binding in absence of C-domain.

AB The beta-carbonic anhydrases (beta-CAs) are widely distributed zinc-metalloenzymes that play essential roles in growth, survival, development and virulence in fungi. The majority of filamentous ascomycetes possess multiple beta-CA isoforms among which major and minor forms have been characterized. We examined the catalytic behavior of the two minor beta-CAs, CafC and CafD, of Aspergillus fumigates, and found that both enzymes exhibited low CO2 hydration activities. To understand the structural basis of their low activities, we performed X-ray crystallographic and site-directed mutagenesis studies. Both enzymes exist as homodimers. Like other Type-I beta-CAs, the CafC active site has an "open" conformation in which the zinc ion is tetrahedrally coordinated by three residues (C36, H88 and C91) and a water molecule. However, L25 and L78 on the rim of the catalytic entry site protrude into the active site cleft, partially occluding access to it. Single (L25G or L78G) and double mutants provided evidence that widening the entrance to the active site greatly accelerates catalytic activity. By contrast, Cam has a typical Type-II "closed" conformation in which the zinc-bound water molecule is replaced by aspartic acid (D36). The most likely explanation for this result is that an arginine that is largely conserved within the beta-CA family is replaced by glycine (G38), so that D36 cannot undergo a conformational change by forming a D-R pair that creates the space for a zinc-bound water molecule and switches the enzyme to the active form. The CafD structure also reveals the presence of a "non-catalytic" zinc ion in the dimer interface, which may contribute to stabilizing the dimeric assembly.

Despite advances in understanding the structural basis for CK perception by the sensor AHK4 in Arabidopsis, the molecular mechanism of CK binding by other sensors is unclear. Here, we report the crystal structure of the CHASE domain in the histidine kinase PcrK of the bacterial plant pathogen Xanthomonas campestris pathovar campestris, which senses plant CK, determined at 2.55 angstrom resolution. The structure reveals that the PcrK has an AHK4-like overall topology and assembles into a homodimer. Strikingly, detailed structural analysis unveils two unique features of the PcrK ligand binding pocket: the size of the pocket is restricted for CK binding, and the PcrK applies a positively charged arginine but not a negatively charged aspartate to recognize the ligand. We propose a model to explain how the PcrK accommodates CK-sized compounds through conformational changes, providing a potential mechanistic framework for understanding ligand recognition by the PcrK.

AB This work presents an energy and financial analysis of an energy trigeneration system, in which electricity, steam and chilled water are produced simultaneously using natural gas as source of input. The system consists of an internal combustion engine, a domestic heat recovery unit, a LiBr/H2O absorption chiller to produce chilled water and a recovery boiler to produce steam. In this system, the exhaust gases produced by the engine are used to drive an absorption chiller through a heat exchanger and can also drive a recovery boiler. According to the final results, and considering total engine load, the overall system of trigeneration presented an energy utilization factor of 74%, with average electricity, cooling and heating production of 214.1 kW, 35.7 kW and 162.1 kW, respectively. A case study based on the energy demands of an ice cream industry is presented in this article for the financial analysis of the system. In order to determine the best configuration for the company, the one that presented a higher financial return, three scenarios were developed for the application of cogeneration or trigeneration in the company. They were analyzed on the financial methodology of calculation of return on investment, using as parameters the net present value (NPV), the internal rate of return (IRR) and the simple payback, based on an interest rate of 6.4% and a project period of 10 years. The first two scenarios created were not economically viable, presenting a negative NPV. However, scenario 3 presented good financial return result, presenting a NPV of $ 269,390.40, a 26.32% IRR and a 3.4 year simple payback, making it the best financial scenario for the company. The results of this work indicate that the configuration proposed in scenario 3 provides several useful results with high efficiency and a good financial return for the company.

AB The spread of wind turbines and photovoltaic modules for green electricity generation is stressing the need of installing large-scale electricity energy storage. Among the in-developing storage technologies, those which store electricity in the form of thermal energy are considered the most promising due to the absence of geological restrictions and long cycle life. In this context, the Authors of the present work, developed a large-scale electricity energy storage unit which uses air as working fluid and stores electrical energy as sensible heat in a man-made tank. As other thermal storage technologies, the proposed one does not suffer of geographical limitations, is characterized by long cycle life and can be assembled with decommissioned devices originally designed for gas turbine plants. In this work, the Authors analyse the plant energetic performance and the construction cost for different storage materials and plant management strategies. Results show that the thermo-physical properties of the storage medium and the charging tolerance affect the plant performance and costs. For these reasons, it is essential selecting the material based on the plant purpose: if the plant works with daily charge/discharge cycle, packed bed made up by limestone or masonry material is suggested while, for weekly charge/discharge cycles, aluminium oxide can be a better storage option.

AB Organic Rankine Cycle is one of the most efficient, profitable and feasible technology for low-to-medium temperature heat recovery. The boost to the development of small-scale systems that could easily enter the market poses challenges in the design and selection of components, and in the choice of the operating conditions. This work deals with a micro-scale Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC) unit that has been designed to be cheap, efficient and compact, and tested to analyze performance and transient response under large variations of the heat source temperature. A dynamic model is also built and validated against two sets of experimental data: the first one refers to maximum power operation of the system and the second one to partial load operation close to the occurrence of two-phase expansion. The goal is to understand the potential of the system to face market applications, for which best design choices, operational limits and response time to variable heat sources must be identified. The choice of scroll expander, volumetric pump and plate heat exchangers has been made according to the lowest cost-to-efficiency ratio to keep the investment cost below 2500 euro/kW, already in the pre-market phase, in the power range of 3-4 kW. Results of the experiments show a fast time response, with a prompt reaction of the system to variations of the heat source temperature. Simulations demonstrated the ability of the model to capture with good accuracy the system dynamics. In particular, the validation process at maximum power operation (expander power output of 3300 W) shows maximum relative errors of about 4% in the prediction of measurements, whereas, the validation process at partial load operation yields slightly higher errors, namely 5.2% and 6.6% in the prediction of the evaporation pressure and the expander power output, respectively.

AB The objective of this work is to propose a hybrid ground source heat pump system integrated with solar energy and investigate its multicriteria performances. A compound parabolic concentrated-photovoltaic thermal solar collector to output electricity and heat is comprehensively integrated with a basic ground source heat pump system. The thermodynamic models of subsystems were established and validated by comparing the simulation results to those from existing studies. The renewable resources were levelized to fossil fuels based on their contributions. The multicriteria performance of the hybrid system was analyzed by using the annual operation conditions of a hotel building. The results indicated that the primary energy ratio and exergy efficiency of the hybrid system are always higher than those of the conventional ground source heat pump system. Various inlet temperatures of solar and thermal tank subsystems in the proposed system was compared and analyzed in terms of the sustainability index, primary energy saving ratio, carbon dioxide emission reduction ratio, and annual cost saving ratio and the results indicated that their appropriate temperatures are 25 degrees C and 60 degrees C, respectively. A sensitivity analysis showed that except for the interest rate, the unit cost of electricity, service life, and maintenance coefficient have positive influences on the economic performance.

AB In this study, thirty of customized bismuth-telluride (Bi2Te3) thermoelectric modules (TEMs) were fabricated for waste heat recovery of a diesel engine using a thermoelectric generator (TEG). By installing a plate-type porous medium whose porosity ranges from 0.121 to 0.516 in the TEG, the effects of the porosity on energy harvesting performance were investigated. Experimental results show that at the highest engine rotation speed of 1400 rpm, a maximum power output of 98.3 W was obtained using the lowest porosity (0.121), and a maximum energy conversion efficiency of 2.83% was obtained using the optimal porosity (0.416). The most significant improvements in the power output and conversion efficiency compared with the base case without porous media were 44.5% and 10.1% with porosities of 0.121 and 0.416, respectively, at the lowest engine speed of 1000 rpm. We concluded that the conversion efficiency and power output of the present TEG can be maximized via application of porous media with porosities of 0.461 and 0.32, respectively. The use of a porous medium with a porosity of < 0.32 in the present TEG configuration should be avoided, as the backpressure would exceed the allowable limit of similar to 3 kPa for a passenger vehicle.

AB Hydrocarbons (HCs) are characterized by extremely low global warming potential (GWP) and are promising working fluid for organic Rankine cycle (ORC). A comprehensive advanced evaluation model is developed to study the energetic, advanced exergy and economic performance of ORC system by using twelve HCs, considering the heat recovery from geothermal, low-temperature solar, engine waste gas heat, and high-temperature solar applications. The results show that cyclohexane obtains the highest value of thermal efficiency for high-temperature solar energy. The exergy efficiency of ORC is improved by about 20% after the system optimization through the advanced exergy analysis. In addition, the recoverable effect for the four major components can be ranked as expander, evaporator, condenser, and pump. Exergetic improvement potential ratio of expander by employing propyne and isopentane obtains the highest value of 12.41% and 12.60% at the heat source temperature of 115 and 140 degrees C, respectively. The lowest value of levelized energy cost are propyne, pentane, cyclohexane, and cyclohexane, which are 1.46, 1.28, 1.05, and 0.95 USD/kWh. Isobutene, isopentane, cyclohexane, and cyclohexane obtain the highest endogenous avoidable cost corresponding to the four heat sources. The endogenous avoidable cost is relatively sensitive to the heat source temperature, and it is reduced by 28% with the heat source temperature increasing from 100 to 150 degrees C, while it is insensitive to the expander efficiency.

AB The dry cooling unit is integrated with a 25 MW recompression super-critical CO2 (sCO(2)) cycle for solar energy application. Based on the optimal operating condition, a natural draft dry cooling tower (NDDCT) is modelled for an ambient temperature of 20 degrees C and sCO(2) inlet condition of 67 degrees C and 7.96 MPa. The Kroger's detailed working principle of NDDCT is adapted in the simulation processes. The sCO(2) property variation with the change of bulk temperature is considered while modelling the heat exchanger unit inside the tower. The draft equation of the tower is solved by including various air-flow resistances at different parts of the tower. The heat input to the cycle is assumed to be supplied by the solar field with sufficient capacity of thermal storage. The seasonal effect on the performance of a dry-cooled sCO(2) recompression cycle is performed in Alice Spring, NT, Australia by using the daily meteorological data. The daily net power generation fluctuates in the range of 2.4% to 22.4% of the design value for the consecutive days. The year-round mean net power generation is 24.66 MW which corresponds to 50.9% cycle efficiency. The weekly and monthly seasonal variation of the plant performance in summer, autumn, winter, and spring is performed based on the mean maximum and minimum temperature data. The mean net power produced in summer and winter is 22.9 MW and 26.4 MW respectively. The fluctuation of heat input to the cycle, heat rejected by the cycle and air mass flow rate in NDDCT are demonstrated. Seven performance indicators (Thermal efficiency, exergetic performance criteria, exergy efficiency, maximum available work, ecological coefficient of performance, cooling efficiency, and ecological function criteria) are determined to evaluate the plant performance for the period of 1941 to 2018 using the mean temperature data.

AB Shipping has been facing significant challenges due to strict limits imposed by the International Maritime Organization (IMO) to become more environmentally sustainable. In this regard, the use of solar energy, as a viable way to deal with the pollutant emissions caused by ships, has been attracted considerable attention. However, considerable investment costs, high area demands, and low performances of ships equipped with the photovoltaic systems have until recently been some of the significant challenges in the use of solar energy in the shipping industry. This paper proposes a novel method for the optimal performance of ships through the simultaneous optimisation of the hull-propulsion-building integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) system. Using the proposed method, the interaction effects among the ship hull, the BIPV system, and the propulsion system, as well as the impact of the wind and ship speeds on the BIPV system efficiency are considered. Ship operational conditions, including the sunshine duration, the clearness index, the ambient temperature, the latitude of the region, the view factor of the sky to ground, the wind and ship speeds, and the ship lifetime hour are also examined. Moreover, a probabilistic speed profile is employed to avoid a suboptimal design at a single ship speed. The performance of the suggested method is evaluated by designing a planing ship equipped with a waterjet propulsion system that operates in the Karun river, Iran. The non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) is used to solve the multi-objective optimisation problem of a planing hull-waterjet-BIPV system. Eight cases are compared to demonstrate the effectiveness and the promise of the proposed approach in different ship design problems with different displacements and BIPV area-to-deck area ratios. The results show the high performance of the adopted approach in cutting operating costs and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Based on the results, the investment costs due to the BIPV system have been recouped within a year in different studied cases and scenarios. It is also found out that the interaction effects among the ship hull, the BIPV system, and the propulsion system are important to ensure the optimal performance of a ship.

AB This paper investigates the nonlinear electromechanical behaviour of a constrained bimorph piezoelectric energy harvester utilising a coupled multi-modal fully nonlinear model, for the first time. The electromechanical system is modelled via using the nonlinear beam theory of Euler-Bernoulli, while assuming an inextensible centreline, and the piezoelectric constitutive equations. The motion constraints are modelled as nonlinear springs, consisting of linear and cubic terms. The coupled electromechanical model, including the electrical circuit equation, is obtained for both parallel and series connections of the piezoelectric layers. The Galerkin scheme is used to discretise the partial differential-type model while retaining a large number of modes to guarantee converged results. Next, the electromechanical model consisting of geometric, inertial, impact, and piezoelectric-type nonlinearities is solved using a well-optimised continuation code. The proposed model and numerical method are verified through comparison to experimental data in the literature. It is shown that adding a tip mass of 50% of the bimorph cantilever mass increase the power output by 263%. Additionally, it is shown that for a power output threshold of 15 mW, the addition of motion constraints results in a 66.8% resonance bandwidth (normalised with respect to first natural frequency) which is almost 10 times the bandwidth of the unconstrained system.

AB To evaluate the performance of a photovoltaic panel, several parameters must be extracted from the photovoltaic. Among the methods developed to extract photovoltaic parameters from current-voltage (I-V) characteristic curve, metaheuristic algorithms are the most used nowadays. The aim of this paper is to present the inaccuracies occurred in the parameter's identification of the photovoltaic cell using metaheuristic technics published in Energy Conversion and Management. The results presented by different authors do not meet the objective function. To prove it, an algorithm is proposed to check the accuracy of the proposed results; a simple tool, General Algebraic Modeling System is also proposed to extract the best values of parameters of a photovoltaic cell.

AB The thermodynamic assessment of a novel multi-generation system producing electrical power, cooling load, potable and sanitary water, and hydrogen is conducted from the viewpoints of energy and exergy analyses. The proposed system consists of a solid oxide fuel cell as the prime mover, a gas turbine, a biomass combustion subsystem, an organic Rankin cycle integrated with an ejector refrigeration cycle, a desalination subsystem, and a proton exchange membrane electrolyser subsystem. The produced fresh water is utilized to produce potable and sanitary water, and hydrogen. Considering the fact that flat plate collectors are employed to raise the water temperature to the operating temperature of the electrolyser, 12 daylight hours of a day are dedicated to sanitary water and hydrogen production by means of the electrolyser and the rest night hours are devoted to potable water production. During the commissioning period of the hydrogen production subsystem, the effect of three crucial parameters including, current density, fuel utilization factor, and solid oxide fuel cell inlet temperature on several variables related to the system has been investigated. It is concluded that under the baseline design conditions, the net electrical power, the cooling load, and the overall energy and exergy efficiencies are correspondingly equal to 4392 kW, 164.2 kW, 77.58%, and 47.14%. Furthermore, the molar rate of the potable and sanitary water, and hydrogen production are 53.27, 52.50, and 0.7695 mol/s, respectively.

AB The object of this paper is to develop and exergetically assess a multi-generation system comprised of a Molten Carbonate Fuel Cell (MCFC) coupled with Steam Methane Reforming (SMR), Methanol Synthesis Process (MSP) with distillation process, and combined heat and power cycle (CHP) including gas turbine, Rankine cycle (RC), Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC) and District Heating (DH) line. The combination of the MCFC, CHP and MSP can be considered as an innovative breakthrough in the field of energy systems, in light of the fact that the reforming compartment can mutually feed both MCFC and MSP, and the whole process can simultaneously produce electricity, pure methanol and hot water. The SMR at 800 kPa and 600 degrees C was applied to produce synthetic gas required by MCFC and MSP. The simulation was performed by Aspen Hysys, considering several operational conditions and the best was selected according to exergetic performance assessment. The structure produced 110,544 kW net electricity (34% MCFC, 33.4% gas turbine, 18.4% RC and 14.2% ORC), pure methanol (99.9%) at 271.7 kgmole/h, and hot water at 80 degrees C and 65398.7 kgmole/h. About 23% and 21% of the overall destructed exergy belonged to combustion chamber and MCFC, respectively. The overall exergy destruction, exergy efficiency and energy efficiency of the integrated system were obtained 116,353 kW, 58.4% and 83.7%, respectively. Finally, the performance of the proposed hybrid system was compared with similar studies and it was found that the hybrid MCFC-MSP-CHP system can outstandingly enhance the overall efficiency and reduce CO2 emissions.

AB Humidification-dehumidification technology is an innovative desalination technology which is promising for small-scale desalination applications. The relative low energy efficiency made the early system less competitive. Multi-stage humidification-dehumidification technology is one of the approaches that effectively improve the system energy efficiency. In this study, an air extraction/injection two-stage humidification-dehumidification system with reflux configuration is proposed. The reflux configuration is introduced into the two-stage system to improve the energy efficiency by eliminating the difference between the air temperatures at the extraction and injection points. A thermodynamic model is developed to investigate the system performance. It is found that the air temperatures at the extraction and injection points are only identical when the pinch point heat capacity rate ratio of first-stage dehumidifier less than unity and that of second-stage dehumidifier greater than unity. The influence of liquid-to-air mass flow rate ratio in the second stage on the energy efficiency of the system is negligible when the pinch point heat capacity rate ratio of first-stage and second-stage dehumidifier both greater than unity. The energy efficiency peaks when the pinch point heat capacity rate ratio of first-stage or second-stage dehumidifier equals unity. Additionally, the reflux configuration can improve the energy efficiency of two-stage system by 30%.

AB A holistic analytical approach is proposed to study the performance of fossil fuel burning integrated energy conversion systems considering energetic, economic, exergetic, environmental and risk (4ER) aspects in a framework. For this, life cycle assessment is conducted to study environmental impacts while other analyses are performed using the algebraic thermo-mathematical programming. The hazardous risks are also investigated using a hazard and operability approach. The external hot and cold utilities are also studied using a novel water-exergy nexus (WExN) analysis. Accordingly, two configurations are developed that integrate a Rankine cycle (RC) and an ejector refrigeration cycle (ERC) for two purposes: power and cooling co-generation (CGS) and power generation (MGS). Water losses in both systems are studied considering three cold utilities and two fossil fuel cycles using the WExN analysis, and the performance of the CGS and the MGS are compared employing several organic fluids. The results showed that the MGS had greater energetic and exergetic efficiencies, better environmental performance, and less hazardous risk impacts compared to the CGS employing almost all working fluids. The smallest exergy loss in the cooling system was 3.90 MW and 7.94 MW in the MGS allocating R123 and the CGS using R718, respectively.

AB The main purpose of this research is to optimize the life cycle cost (LCC) while minimizing the annual irreversibility of the system in three different modes of a vertical ground heat pump (water-to-water) including heating, cooling, and multi-usage. The multi-objective optimization of the LCC and exergy destruction was done by using the multi-objective particle swarm optimization (MOPSO) algorithms and also by considering all involving effective parameters such as the number of boreholes, depth of buried pipes in ground source heat exchanger (GSHX), fan coil setpoint temperature and surface area of condenser and evaporator. In order to reduce energy consumption and meet the building's heat requirement at any time, the compressor was simulated with variable speed drive (VSD) in transient operations. In this study, the investigated refrigerant was R134a, and the shell-and-tube type of heat exchanger was considered for the condenser and evaporator. The obtained results show that the use of the heat pump in single heating mode leads to lower exergy destruction and better performance of the system in terms of exergy efficiency. Also, the economic results indicate that the total initial costs for the multi-usage mode is 27% higher than the single heating mode while it is 8.5% higher than the single cooling mode. The average electricity cost per operation time in multi-usage is 15% higher than single heating and 3% lower than single cooling and equal to 0.139 $/hour.

AB This document deals with waste heat recovery from a natural gas compressor station driven by a set of 7 gas engines. Attention is paid to waste heat from engine exhaust gases. Possible options of energy recovery include: a) direct heat recovery with optional thermal energy storage, b) conversion of waste heat to electricity via an ORC module, or c) integration of gas expanders into the gas supply line in junction with waste heat recovery.
   Options for direct utilization of the recovered waste heat comprise: a) supply of heat for the in-house demand of the CS object, b) supply of heat of a larger residential consumer c) supply of heat for a dedicated consumer, intentionally located next to the CS. For external supplies heat can be supplied by pipeline or via a mobile PCM storage.
   The studied options were related with the possible pilot plant design bottoming 1 or 2 engines with a waste heat recovery system. For the potential pilot plant, the total rate of waste heat recovery from the CS is low, ranging from 3.1% to 11.6% for the studied cases. Effects related only to the given engine represent between 19.3 and 41.4% recovery rate. Simultaneously, these effects are significant for the studied consumers, being able to cover between 33.7 to even 98.1% of their demand from the waste heat recovery source.
   A PCM storage has a weak and non-uniform effect on system performance, depending on the profile of source and consumer.
   Direct heat recovery is recommended for a pilot plant, and the recovered quantity of waste heat may reach 900 MWh/year from a single engine if operated continuously. Electricity generation may reach 530 MWh year (gas expander system) or about 300 MWh/year (ORC system), however, the latter should be recommended for more than one engine as waste heat source.
   Intentional location of a heat consumer near the waste heat source as well as increasing the time of operation of the bottomed engine are two recommendations of this study.

AB Time of use (TOU) rate has been regarded as an effective strategy to associate utility companies to avoid peak time financial risks and make the most profit out of the market, while most programs are not effective as expected to reduce peak time demand of residents. Exploring the impact factors of peak demand reduction (PDR) can help policy makers find reasons that weaken effects of programs and corresponding measures can be carried out to maximize the benefits. However, averaging quantitative indicators for program assessment and incomplete impactor analysis method in existing research show limitations of revealing the complex reasons behind it. In this paper, an association rule mining based quantitative analysis framework is built to explore the impact of household characteristics on PDR under TOU price making up for the deficiencies in current research. Firstly, a probability distribution based customer PDR characterizing model is proposed, in which difference-indifference model is adopted to quantify the effect of PDR and probability distribution fitting method is used to characterize the feature of PDR for households. Then a comprehensive association rule mining analysis using Apriori algorithm is presented to explore the impacts factors of PDR covering four categories of household characteristics including dwelling characteristics, socio-demographic, appliances and heating and attitudes towards energy. Finally, analysis results of a case study based on 2993 household records containing smart metering data and survey data illustrate that PDR level cannot be obtained simply based on the appliance's ownership and its usage habits. Socio-demographic information of households should be taken into consideration together; Internet connection and good house insulation contribute to the increase of PDR level. Moreover, the percentage of renewable generation for households also show a certain relationship with PDR. The proposed analysis framework and findings will associate retailer to improve the benefits of TOU programs and guide policy makers to design more efficient energy saving policies for residents.

AB The maximum power point (MPP) may be not tracked successfully because of the constraint conditions among some circuit parameters. To solve this problem, in this paper, the maximum power point tracking (MPPT) constraint conditions of photovoltaic (PV) system with inverter are found by analyzing its integrated mathematical model. Based on them, a variable-weather-parameter (VWP) MPPT control strategy is proposed. By the use of it, the complex control for the combination of the DC/DC converter and inverter can be avoided, which ensures the lower hardware cost, shorter design period and better MPPT performance. Finally, some simulation experiments show that the proposed MPPT constraint conditions are accurate and reasonable regardless of the varying irradiance, temperature or load, verify that the proposed MPPT control strategy is feasible and available to track the MPP successfully, and illustrate that there is a better MPPT performance than the conventional perturb and observe (P&O) method and fuzzy control method.

AB Supercritical carbon dioxide Brayton cycle is considered one of the most promising systems for waste heat recovery of engines because of its compactness and high energy efficiency. To further improve the fuel utilization ratio and solve the difficulties of waste heat recovery of high temperature exhaust gas, a regenerative supercritical carbon dioxide Brayton cycle/organic Rankine cycle dual loop is proposed for cascade utilization of exhaust heat from a dual-fuel engine. The regenerative supercritical carbon dioxide Brayton cycle of the proposed system is powered by the waste heat contained in the exhaust gas. The working fluid in the organic Rankine cycle is pre-heated by CO2 exiting the regenerator and then further heated by the residual heat of the exhaust gas. The flow rates of the working fluids in both sub cycles are adjusted to match the waste heat recovery system to respond to the changing conditions of the dual-fuel engine. The results revealed that the maximum net power output of this system is up to 40.88 kW, thus improving the dual-fuel engine power output by 6.78%. Therefore, such a regenerative supercritical carbon dioxide Brayton cycle/organic Rankine cycle dual loop system design enables the thorough recovery of high temperature exhaust heat, leading to higher energy efficiency and lower fuel consumption of the engine.

AB The lifetime of vehicular proton exchange membrane fuel cell is one of the key factors restricting the commercialization of fuel cell vehicles. It's well recognized variable load conditions have the greatest impact on fuel cell degradation. Studying dynamic load characteristics is very crucial for fuel cell long-life design and optimal control. Since experiments are not easy to monitor fuel cell internal distribution, the dynamic response studying is commonly implemented in model simulation. The fuel cell system has complicated structures and large differences in length scale, to make up for the insufficient precision and limited research content in existing models, this paper uses an innovative modeling method, Simulink and Fluent co-simulation method to establish a fuel cell system-level model. It can obtain not only response characteristics of auxiliary subsystems and the system dynamic performance, but also the internal physical quantities distribution changes. Multiple simulations and comparisons are made to observe voltage dynamic response and internal concentration distribution. Impacts of subsystem's response characteristics and system's critical operational parameters and mechanism behind them are analyzed. The co-simulation method and obtained results in this paper can be used for future research of fuel cell system-level modeling and provide theoretical basis for dynamic capacity optimization.

AB This paper proposed a novel dual-chilling-source refrigerating system using R407C applied in the temperature and humidity independent control system. The theoretical model was established to analyze the performance of this system regarding the coefficient of performance, exergy loss and exergy efficiency in comparisons with a single-chilling-source refrigerating system. The results showed that the dual-chilling-source refrigerating system had obvious advantages over the single-chilling-source refrigerating system. The dual-chilling-source refrigerating system improved the coefficient of performance and exergy efficiency by about 25% and 30%, respectively, and decreased exergy loss by around 25%. The outdoor relative humidity had the most significant effects on the system exergy loss. With the outdoor relative humidity increasing from 40% to 90%, the exergy loss value was increased by about 43% and 42% for the single-chilling-source refrigerating system and dual-chilling-source refrigerating system, respectively. The effects of low-temperature chilled water temperature on the coefficient of performance, exergy loss and exergy efficiency were more remarkable than those of high-temperature chilled water temperature. Overall, the dual-chilling-source refrigerating system had significant potential in saving energy and improving exergy efficiency, especially for the high humidity load area.

AB With rapid development of artificial intelligence, data-driven prediction models play an important role in energy prediction, fault detection, and diagnosis. This paper proposes an ensemble approach using random forest (RF) for hourly performance predictions of GSHP system. Two years of in situ data were collected in an educational building situated in severe cold area in China. Prediction models were established for performance indicators, and results indicate that the average error for COPs, COPu, EERs and EERu were all controlled within 5%. The model established by small amount of data can accurately predict long-term performance, thereby reducing time and difficulty of data collection. RF models, trained with different parameter settings were compared, results indicate that model accuracy was not very sensitive to variables numbers. The impact of input variables on prediction performance was analyzed, and importance ranking changed with period and performance indicators. By comparing the variable importance list, it was possible to establish which parameters were abnormal and lists of different periods can reflect whether the energy structure of building has changed.
   The overall superiority of RF was verified by comparing with back propagation neural network (BPNN) from robustness, interpretability, and efficiency. First, since GSHP system involving multiple indicators, the robustness, measured by average accuracy, was used to evaluate the accuracy level. According to CV-RMSE, robustness of RF is approximately 3.3% higher than that of BPNN. Second, RF is highly interpretive but BPNN is typical black box model. Finally, modeling complexity and training time of BPNN were much greater than RF.

AB A combined cycle coupling a supercritical power cycle with a transcritical refrigeration cycle with carbon dioxide as working fluid is evaluated and optimized from the exergoeconomic viewpoint. The system is designed to produce power, refrigeration, and heating simultaneously. If no net power is generated, the system can be described as a cogeneration. First, the cogeneration system working with various evaporation temperatures is optimized for having the lowest average cost of the products, which indicates that the system is preferred to operate at the lower evaporation temperature. Then for tri-generation, by increasing the power output and the pressure merging two sub-systems, the cost of the products (average and individual) reduces and the efficiency of the overall system increases. In addition, the cost of the power is the lowest while the cost of the refrigeration is the highest, and the cost of the heating is sensitive to the operation conditions of the overall system.

AB The recovery of waste heat from thermal engines or industrial processes is prerequisite to achieve high efficiencies in the utilization of primary energy resources. When the waste heat is available at high temperatures, the most obvious solution for power production is the multi-pressure steam Rankine cycle, where the staging of the evaporation process is required to reach a good thermal match in the heat transfer process. Different options have been proposed in the search of simpler plant layout and more compact equipment, which include the use of water-ammonia mixtures, high critical temperature organic fluids or the operation at supercritical pressures. The last option is receiving an increasing attention when carbon dioxide is used as working fluid. Supercritical CO2 power cycles have been deeply investigated for nuclear and concentrating solar power, whereas their potential in waste heat recovery (WHR) applications is still largely unexplored. While the plant design for the former applications appears already standardized on only few traditional layouts showing a high cycle thermal efficiency like the recompression cycle, there is much more dynamism in the WHR field where an effective heat extraction from the open loop heat carrier asks for a dedicated plant design. Even though there is still a lack of consensus on the best CO2 power cycle design for WHR, a few layouts are recurrent in the recent literature since their first proposal at the beginning of this decade. This work investigates the potential of two of these novel layouts, namely the single and dual flow split with dual expansion, in the recovery of waste heat in a wide temperature range between 400 and 800 degrees C in comparison to the more traditional single recuperated and recompression layouts. This is evaluated not only in terms of cycle thermal efficiency, but also considering their capability in extracting heat from the heat carrier in a wide domain of the decision variables. The results of the thermodynamic optimization for a 1 MW system show that the total heat recovery efficiency, which is the ratio between net power output and heat available from the heat carrier, for the most advanced layout reaches 17.8%-28.5%, which is 5.8-9.5%-points higher than the traditional layouts, and raises with the heat source temperature. The multi-objective optimization shows that the marked increase in performance is obtained at the expenses of only a limited increase of 5.0-6.2% in specific investment cost compared to the traditional cycles. Thus, the development of s-CO2 power cycle layouts specifically developed for WHR appear mandatory especially for the upper temperature range.

AB Nowadays, a high amount of industrial thermal energy is still lost due to the lack of competitive solutions for energy revalorization. Facing this challenge, this paper presents a novel technology, based on a reversible High-Temperature Heat Pump (HTHP) and Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC). The proposed system recovers low-grade waste heat to generate electricity or useful heat in accordance with consumer demand. Compressor and expander semi-empirical models have been considered for the reversible system computational simulation, being HFC-245fa the working fluid selected. The built-in volume ratio and Internal Heat Exchanger (IHX) effectiveness have been optimized to reach the maximum energy efficiency in each operating condition. Although HFC-245fa exhibits energy performance attributes, its high Global Warming Potential (GWP) is an issue for climate change mitigation. Hence, multi-objective optimisation of the environmentally friendly working fluids Butane, Pentane, HFO-1336mzz(Z), R-514A, HCFO-1233zd(E) and HCFO-1224yd(Z) has been carried out. The results show that the system proposed, working with HFC-245fa, achieves a Coefficient of Performance (COP) of 2.44 for condensing temperature of 140 degrees C, operating in HTHP mode, whereas the ORC mode provides a net electrical efficiency of 8.7% at condensing temperature of 40 degrees C. Besides, HCFO-1233zd(E) and HCFO-1224yd(Z) are both appropriate alternatives for the HFC-245fa replacement. These working fluids provide a COP improvement of 9.7% and 5.8% and electrical net efficiency improvement of 2.1% and 0.8%, respectively, compared to HFC-245fa. This paper provides a reference study for further designs and developments of reversible HTHP-ORC systems used for industrial low-grade waste heat recovery.

AB In the present study, a transcritical refrigeration cycle's performance with dedicated mechanical subcooling (MS) is investigated from the energy, exergy and exergoeconomic viewpoints. Three different refrigerants containing CO2 (R744), N2O (R744A) and ethane (R170) are considered as the transcritical cycle's refrigerant. A thorough parametric study is carried out on the system and finally, the effect of dedicated subcooling system is checked out on the energy, exergy and exergoeconomic perimeters. Based on the results, value of the COP and exergy performance for N2O, unlike the CO2, is the highest. In other words, the CO2 refrigerant shows the best economic performance. By comparing the system with and without subcooling cycle, it can be concluded that utilizing subcooler improves performance of the system and increases the unit product cost. However, the unit product cost increment is much lower than COP improvement which makes the subcooling an effective and economical way to improve the refrigeration system's performance. Application of subcooler leads to an enhancement of 30.74%, 26.48% and 36.1% in COP for CO2, N2O, and ethane, respectively while the unit product cost increment is 9.04%, 8.37% and 10.63% for the mentioned refrigerants, respectively.

AB On offshore platform applications, power and heat are normally supplied by simple open cycle gas turbine (OCGT) and heat recovery steam generators (HRSG) at lower efficiencies if compared to onshore combined cycle systems. Certainly, due to the reduced available space and the weight constraints, combined cycles are not commonly considered as cogeneration systems on conventional offshore petroleum platforms. However, more stringent environmental policies for the natural gas and oil production activities have motivated the integration assessment of advanced technological solutions that aim to mitigate the environmental impact that conventional offshore platforms are responsible for. Accordingly, in this paper, the effect of the integration of a low emission, oxyfuel gas turbine cycle is analyzed and compared against an amines-based post-combustion system and a conventional offshore petroleum platform operation in terms of its exergy efficiency and reduced atmospheric CO2 emissions. Indeed, although the conventional configuration is the most efficient, the oxyfuel powered platform configuration presents close power cycle efficiency of 27.10% and the lowest specific CO2 emissions of 0.014 kg(co2)/t(oil), whereas the amines-based layout provides the best cogeneration efficiency (55.34%) of the advanced configurations. Moreover, an energy integration analysis is performed to identify the heat recovery potential, while the exergy method is used to evaluate and quantify the most critical components that lead to the largest irreversibilities along the primary separation, cogeneration and gas compression systems. As a result, the study points to ways of decarbonizing offshore applications in the oil and gas sector.

AB The present work proposes the design process of a novel dual-core electromagnetic energy harvester (EMEH) for the use in a deicing robot, used on power transmission lines. The EMEH is designed with a dual-core where Silicon (Si) and Nickel (Ni) steels have been used in order to take advantage of both materials characteristics. An analytical model for the EMEH has been proposed in this paper which is compared with the 3D finite element method (FEM) based model of the EMEH under the same design specification. Moreover, considering the magnetic equivalent circuit model of the EMEH, equivalent circuit parameters are determined. Furthermore, to obtain the impedance matching and to extract the maximum real power from the EMEH, power optimization circuit consisting of a capacitor and a buck-boost converter is proposed and the parameters for the power optimization circuit are evaluated. To validate the effectiveness of the EMEH and its power optimization circuit, a co-simulation design platform is developed using the 3D-FEM and MATLAB coupled in a python-based environment. On the co-simulation platform, the charging of a rechargeable battery of 15 V is verified.

AB Thermal performance and pressure drop of TiO2-H2O nanofluids in double-tube heat exchangers are investigated. The influence of the thermal fluid (water) volume flow rates (q(v) = 1-5 L/min), nanoparticle mass frictions (omega = 0.0%, 0.1%, 0.3% and 0.5%), nanofluids locations (shell-side and tube-side), Reynolds numbers of nanofluids (Re = 3000-12000), and the structures of inner tubes (smooth tube and corrugated tube) is analyzed. Results indicate that nanofluids (omega = 0.1%, 0.3% and 0.5%) can improve the heat transfer rate by 10.8%, 13.4% and 14.8% at best compared with deionized water respectively, and the number of transfer units (NTU) and effectiveness are all improved. The pressure drop can be increased by 51.9% (tube-side) and 40.7% (shell-side) at best under the condition of using both nanofluids and corrugated inner tube. When the nanofluids flow in the shell-side of the corrugated double-tube heat exchanger, the comprehensive performance of nanofluids-side is better than that of the smooth double-tube heat exchanger.

AB The aim of this study is to optimize the integrated performance of a hybrid combined cooling, heating, and power system driven by natural gas as well as solar and geothermal energy resources from the energy, economy, and emission perspectives. A basic natural gas system with a prime mover unit, absorption chiller, and electricity and thermal storage components is coupled with solar photovoltaic panels and a ground source heat pump. A multi-objective optimization method is proposed and employed to optimize the configurations of the hybrid system and thereby achieve optimal performances using non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II. Accordingly, the variable output ratio of ground source heat pump is optimized to match the heat to electricity ratios between the system and users. The hybrid system's schemes of a specific case building that operates in different modes are optimized and compared; these schemes include following electric load, following thermal load, and following hybrid load. The impacts of natural gas and grid electricity prices on system performance are investigated. The results demonstrate that the configurations of the hybrid system that operates using the following electric load strategy achieves better performances than other modes. The proposed optimization method herein can be effective in optimizing the configurations of a hybrid system and consequently improve system performances.

AB With the ever increasing power dissipation in electrical devices, new thermal management solutions are in high demand to maintain an optimal operating temperature and efficient performance. In particular, recently developed magnetically-activated thermal switches (MATSs) provide an alternative to existing devices, using the magnetic and thermal properties of superparamagnetic nanofluids to dissipate heat in a controlled manner. However, the presence of moving parts is a major drawback in these systems that must still be addressed. Herein, we present a compact and automatized MATS composed by an encapsulated superparamagnetic nanofluid and an electromagnet allowing to activate the MATS without any moving part. We investigate the effect of different temperature gradients (10, 26 and 40 degrees C) and powers applied to the coil (6.5, 15, 25 and 39 W) on the performance of this novel MATS. The results show that the highest (44.4%) and fastest (0.6 degrees C/s) temperature variation occur for the highest studied temperature gradient. On the other hand, with increasing power, there is also an increase in the efficiency of the heat exchange process between the two surfaces. These results remove one of the main barriers preventing the actual application of magnetic thermal switches and opens new venues for the design of efficient thermal management devices.

AB Over the decades, unremitting efforts have been made to achieve energy conservation and emission reduction throughout the world. While for a vehicle engine, a great deal of the fuel energy is wasted as exhaust heat. Based on a novel exhaust heat recovery system devised and modified on a vehicle exhaust channel, the chief objective of this study is to improve the vehicle economy and emissions under cold start. Therefore, a detailed experimental investigation was conducted on the chassis dynamometer (CD) under cold start NEDC at 25 degrees C and -7 degrees C temperatures. And the method of comparative analyses of the coolant temperature, gasoline fuel consumption and exhaust emissions including total hydrocarbon (THC), carbon monoxide (CO) and nitrogen oxide (NOx) have been obtained to reveal the effects of EHRS on vehicle economy and emissions under cold start. The results show that, since the coolant temperature can be quickly increased with EHRS to shorten engine warm-up time under cold start, vehicle economy is enhanced during NEDC. Moreover, the device of EHRS can effectively alleviate the combustion deterioration and wall frame quenching effect in the cylinders under cold start, which greatly decreases THC emission. Although the excess air coefficient cannot be changed by EHRS, it can improve the combustion environment in cylinders, which contributes to the reduction of CO emission. It is unexpected to find that NOx emission is also decreased with EHRS actuation, which can be explained by a new theory called Fenimore mechanism. All these aims to provide helpful preliminary work for vehicles to meet the upcoming stringent limit of the real driving emission (RDE) of CHINA 6.

AB Thermochemical energy storage based on CaO/CaCO3 cycles is a promising technique used in concentrated solar power plant. The high global efficiency can be achieved under high carbonation pressure and temperature. In this work, limestone and carbide slag were chosen as the representatives of Ca-based natural and waste materials, respectively. The thermochemical energy storage performances of the limestone and the carbide slag under high carbonation pressure condition ( > 1.0 MPa) during CaO/CaCO3 cycles were studied in a pressurized dual fixed-bed reactor. The effects of carbonation temperature, calcination temperature and number of energy storage cycles under high carbonation pressure condition were also researched. The energy storage capacities of two Ca-based materials are enhanced significantly with increasing the carbonation pressure. The carbonation conversion and energy density of the limestone carbonated under 1.3 MPa are about 0.83 and 2626 kJ/kg after 10 cycles, respectively, which are 1.76 times as high as those carbonated under 0.1 MPa. The carbide slag carbonated under high pressure exhibits higher cyclic stability than the limestone during long-term energy storage cycles. In addition, the optimum temperatures for the energy storage of the limestone and the carbide slag carbonated under 1.3 MPa are 850-900 degrees C and 800-850 degrees C, respectively. High carbonation pressure can mitigate the sintering and pore-plugging of CaO. The average grain size of CaO carbonated under higher pressure increases more slowly with the number of energy storage cycles. The microstructure of the Ca-based material carbonated under high pressure appears more porous than that carbonated under atmospheric pressure. Increasing carbonation pressure is an effective method to improve the energy storage capacity of Ca-based material. The carbide slag is also a good candidate for long-term thermochemical energy storage under high pressure.

AB A two degrees of freedom (DOF) vibro-wind galloping energy harvester with a nested structure is proposed to improve wind energy harvesting efficiency. Unlike traditional wind energy harvesters configured in a single bluff body-beam structure, the proposed system comprises outer and inner square cross-sectional bluff bodies in tandem, connected with elastic cantilevered beams to allow separate oscillations. The generated power performance of a conventional single-DOF wind galloping energy harvester and the proposed system is compared through wind tunnel tests. Aerodynamic interactions between the two oscillating bluff bodies are analyzed by varying the gap distances and the coupling mechanism is determined by analyzing their power spectral density (PSD). Experimental results show that the outer bluff body has a dominant influence on the inner bluff body at low wind speed, which is a secondary cause of inner body vibration after the plain galloping directly induced by the incoming wind. The proposed system exhibits excellent performance with a significant power density increase of 27.8%. Moreover, the interference effects between the two bluff bodies can be reinforced by reducing their gap distance. We conclude that the inner bluff body plays a key role in enhancing output power, specifically at relatively high wind speed.

AB There are few available related studies about condensing flow regime in the transonic mixing process of steam ejector due to its extreme complexity, although it is of great importance for improving ejector entrainment performance and broadening its application. In this paper, a visualization experimental platform of desalination-oriented steam ejector is designed, and the condensing flow regimes under various entrainment pressures p(H) are captured from multiple perspectives, by means of direct photography approach. The results reveal that the supersonic jet flow is full with massive amounts of condensation droplets whose particle size distribution is not uniform at various vertical positions, and some easily lose their dynamic equilibrium. There exists a slant reverse condensing flow cross-section at the mixing chamber end, which moves upstream as p(H) rises and where great numbers of condensation droplets constantly generate around. The condensate quantity of each observation surface is different and increases with p(H). The reverse condensing flow regime formed is very complex and accompanied by flexible swirls, clockwise circumferential flow and condensate dynamic accumulation. Then the generated condensate significantly reduces after multiple evaporations downstream the reverse cross-section. It is also found that the flow regime is similar at a same field of view, but diverse at the different fields of view. These meaningful results could serve as a good start point for reducing internal irreversible losses and tailoring ejector design, as well as refining and evaluating physical and mathematical two-phase flow ejector models.

AB Partial shading plays a vital role in reduction of output power from Solar Photo-Voltaic (SPV) array. In SPV arrays, power loss is dependent on shading patterns, shading area and level of irradiation. In this work, Chaotic Baker Map (CBM) technique is proposed, to reduce the mismatch power losses due to partial shading. This technique focuses on reducing the power loss by spreading the partial shading effect across the entire array without changing its electrical connections. The efficacy of the proposed system is analyzed and compared with conventional configurations such as, Series Parallel, Total Cross Tied, Bridge Link and Honey Comb configurations during different uniform and non-uniform shading conditions for 4 x 4 and 6 x 6 SPV Arrays. From the comparative results, it is observed that the proposed image processing based Chaotic Baker Map improves the output power and reduces the power loss under all shading conditions. As the proposed configuration doesn't involve complex algorithms, it is ideally suitable for Building Integrated PV (BIPV) systems and large size solar farms without any complications.

AB The full exploitation of the upper thermal source is the key for enhanced energy performances of ORC-based units for medium and low-grade waste heat recovery. The adoption of a dual evaporation pressure cycle layout has the potential to reduce the heat exchange irreversibility at the evaporation section and to assure a higher net power available at the expander shaft, particularly in small scale units and in presence of upper thermal sources with a highly variable heat release characteristic. The adoption of the dual evaporation pressure technology to small scale recovery units represents a major technological breakthrough and an element of novelty, observing that, at present, the possibility to split the evaporation process in multiple pressure levels is considered mostly with reference to steam generators and boilers. The study investigates the potential energy and exergy advantage of a dual pressure heat recovery vapor generator, with respect to a base-single evaporation pressure layout, for a recovery unit with a mechanical power in the 1-15 kW range, for stationary (100 degrees C-150 degrees C hot source temperature) and on-board (350 degrees C-300 degrees C hot source temperature) applications. A dedicated optimization procedure allows the maximization of either the net power recovered or the cycle energy efficiency, dependently on the final application of the unit. The exergy efficiency of the heat recovery vapor generator is assessed and its dependence on the fluid characteristics and the main cycle variables discussed, along with the relationship between the energy and exergy gain for the enhanced heat exchange. A preliminary economic analysis provides a first indication of the financial merit of the dual evaporation pressure layout with respect to a base single evaporation pressure configuration.

AB To understand the effect of reducibility of transition metal oxides (TMOs) on tar conversion, four TMOs including Fe2O3, MnOx, CuO, and NiO were selected and in-situ oxidative catalytic cracking of coal pyrolysis tar on a two-stage fixed bed reactor at 550 degrees C was performed. The reducibility of TMOs was measured by H-2-temperature programmed reduction (H-2-TPR). The effect of reducibility of TMOs on the pyrolysis products distribution and conversion was investigated. The changes of TMOs before and after reaction were also analyzed by several characterizations. The addition of TMOs results in the decrease of tar yield and heavy tar content, and the increase of gas yield. The reduction temperature of TMOs affects the products distribution and heavy tar conversion. Among these four TMOs, Fe2O3 shows the highest reduction temperature (390-700 degrees C with peak centered on 570 degrees C) and the largest heavy tar conversion (75.3 wt%). CuO shows the lowest reduction temperature (190-470 degrees C with peak centered on 326 degrees C) and heavy tar conversion (45.8 wt%). The main reactions on CuO is complete oxidation with high water yield (12.8 wt%) and CO2 formation (110 mL/g.coal(daf)). The coke formed on the used Fe2O3 is amorphous or disordered carbon, and shows the largest yield being 5.5 wt%.

AB Catalytic conversion of rubber wastes to produce an alternative fuel resource is a promising approach to dispose of solid wastes and address environmental issues. In this study, catalytic fast pyrolysis (CFP) of rubber wastes over acidic zeolites was conducted, and the effect of SiO2/Al2O3 mole ratio of USY zeolites on the formation of aromatic hydrocarbons was explored. Experimental results indicated that alkenes and aromatic hydrocarbons were the main pyrolytic products obtained from fast pyrolysis of rubber wastes, and the pyrolysis temperature played a vital role in the formation of aromatics with the highest concentration achieved at 750 degrees C. Moreover, catalyst types also affected the catalytic degradation of rubber wastes since limonene was completely decomposed in the presence of zeolites. Compared to SAPO-34, zeolites with higher external surface area, stronger Bronsted acid sites, and larger pore size, including USY, HY, and H beta, were more effective in the production of aromatic hydrocarbons with the highest content obtained from USY catalyzed run. Given the observed effect of SiO2/Al2O3 mole ratio of USY zeolites on the formation of aromatic hydrocarbons during the CFP of rubber wastes, USY with low SiO2/Al2O3 ratio of 5.3 was more beneficial to the generation of aromatic hydrocarbons, while that with higher SiO2/Al2O3 mole ratio (11.5) facilitated the formation of alkenes. Simultaneously, the product distribution of aromatic hydrocarbons obtained from CFP of rubber wastes over USY zeolites was dominated by xylenes, alkylbenzenes, and toluene, and USY with SiO2/Al2O3 mole ratio of 5.3 was more active in the production of toluene and xylenes.

AB Dual-pressure and transcritical Organic Rankine Cycles (DORC and TORC) all have advantages of increasing the thermal match between the working fluid and heat source. However, their temperature ranges of applicable heat source are different. This study focuses on the investigation and comparison of subcritical ORC (SORC), TORC and DORC using various working fluids for recovering energy of hot water which temperature is between 120 degrees C and 200 degrees C. Effects of evaporation pressure of SORC, two-stages pressures of DORC, and turbine inlet parameters (temperature and pressure) of TORC on the thermal match and the net power output have been studied. Then the thermal match and net power output comparisons of SORC, DORC and TORC under the optimal conditions for various temperatures of heat source (120-200 degrees C) have been presented. Furthermore, the maximum net powers of threes cycles using various working fluids are also optimized and compared when the heat source tempera. tures are given. The results indicate that for the DORC system, the thermal match improves as high stage pressure rises. And compared with the low stage pressure, the high stage pressure has a greater effect on the system performance. For the TORC system, the slop of temperature rising curve of supercritical working fluid is affected by the factors such as heat source inlet temperature, turbine inlet temperature and turbine inlet pressure of turbine. And it influences the thermal match in the vapor generator. There is a boundary temperature of heat source for the selection of DORC and TORC using various working fluids. If heat source temperature is less than the boundary temperature, DORC shows better system performance, otherwise, TORC possesses better performance. The boundary temperatures of R1234ze(E), R227ea, Isobutane, R245fa are 151.4 degrees C, 125.5 degrees C, 170.8 degrees C and 195.8 degrees C respectively. And the analyzed results also present that there exists suitable cycle layout and appropriate working fluid to achieve best thermal match and produce maximum net power when the heat source temperature is given.

AB The co-processing of bio-oil and vacuum gas oil (VGO) in an existing fluid catalytic cracker (FCC) for productions of gasoline and diesel has been proposed and regarded as a possible technique to realize partial replacement of fossil fuels. A techno-economic analysis (TEA) was conducted to evaluate the economics of two co-processing scenarios, the co-processing of VGO and the fast pyrolysis oil or the catalytic pyrolysis oil. As revealed by the TEA results, the capital cost can be reduced significantly by using the existing refinery infrastructures and the minimum gasoline selling prices under the two scenarios were $2.63 and $2.60 per gallon respectively, which can be competing with that of petroleum-derived gasoline. As shown by the sensitivity analysis, the gasoline price was extremely sensitive to the fluctuations of the fuel yields, VGO and diesel prices, and FCC capability. Therefore, the co-processing technique to produce bio-transportation fuels can be identified as a partial replacement for the petroleum-derived fuels.

AB The present study aimed to evaluate the energy recovery through biodiesel and bioethanol production from Scenedesmus obliquus in a sequential route of lipid extraction followed by fermentation, with recycling of waste glycerol (WG) as a nutrient supplement into the culture. Low WG concentrations significantly enhanced the cellular dry weight over the control, recording the maximum significant value of 3.63 g L-1 using 2.5 g L-1 of WG (WG2.5). In addition, the maximum carbohydrate and lipid contents were recorded in WG2.5, which represented 16.4% and 21.7%, respectively, over the corresponding control, with simultaneous reduction in protein content. Moreover, total fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) recovery from biomass increased after WG2.5 supplementation, recording an increase of 24.6% over the control. Fermentation of lipid-free biomass increased the rate of bioethanol production, reaching its peak of 4.82 g L-1 at the 27th day. However, using of WG2.5 for microalgal growth and the residual lipid-free biomass for fermentation showed the highest bioethanol production peak of 5.58 g L-1 at day 27. Due to the accumulation of carbohydrates under WG, the biomass treated with WG2.5 showed increase in maximum bioethanol productivity up to 0.185 g L(-1)h(-1). However, sequential fermentation after lipid extraction enhanced the maximum bioethanol productivity by 32.3% and 15.1% over the whole cells from synthetic wastewater (WW) and lipid-free biomass from WW, respectively. The highest gross energy output of 21.4 GJ ton(-1) dry microalgae was estimated from the integrated route where S. obliquus was grown in WG-enriched medium and sequential fermentation was applied for the residual biomass after lipid extraction, with the highest recorded energy conversion efficiency of 62.9%. These findings provide an innovative practical integrated approach for waste recycling and high conversion efficiency of microalgal biomass for liquid biofuel production.

AB Attributing to the research on key parameters analysis and working fluid selection, this paper attempted to propose a quantitative method for the performance of zeotropic working fluids used in subcritical organic Rankine cycle. Based on the graphical analysis method in temperature-entropy diagram, the limiting performances, which could be measured using limiting thermal efficiency and limiting thermodynamics perfection, of 4 typical zeotropic working fluids used in simple and regenerative organic Rankine cycle were proposed and calculated. The key affecting parameters and variation mechanism were analyzed as well. The results show that the limiting thermal efficiency of simple organic Rankine cycle increases with the increasing of latent heat of vaporization in both evaporation and condensation process, slope of working fluid saturated liquid line and the decreasing of temperature glide in both evaporation and condensation process, specific heat capacity of liquid working fluid at constant pressure. In addition to the impact of temperature glide in condensation process on limiting thermal efficiency of regenerative organic Rankine cycle, which should be determined according to specific working fluid, the impact of other parameters on limiting thermal efficiency of regenerative organic Rankine cycle is the same as that of simple organic Rankine cycle. The quantitative description of the limiting performance of zeotropic working fluid is of great significance to the analysis and improvement of cycle performance with an in-depth understanding on mechanism and could guide the selection or design of zeotropic working fluid.

AB In this work, exergy and exergoeconomic cost analyses are applied to biomass and natural gas co-firing in a combined cooling, heating, and power (CCHP) system, based on the structural theory of thermoeconomics. The thermoeconomic model for the investigated co-firing CCHP system is defined to quantify the productive relationships among the various components. The unit exergy/exergoeconomic cost of all flows in the productive structure are calculated by solving the characteristic equations and exergy/exergoeconomic cost equations together with the auxiliary cost allocation equations. A comparative analysis between the previous auxiliary cost allocation method and the method based on energy level is presented. Moreover, the production performance of components under summer and winter conditions are evaluated based on the exergy cost analysis. The results show that, compared with the previous method, the exergoeconomic costs of electricity with higher energy level increase 21.10 and 22.90 USD/MWh under summer and winter conditions, respectively, while the costs of other products with lower energy level decrease. Furthermore, a sensitivity analysis is presented to analyze the variation of the unit exergoeconomic cost of products with fuel prices and some non-energy factors. In conclusion, the structural theory of thermoeconomics integrated with auxiliary cost allocation equations based on the energy level can provide reasonable and accurate results for multi-product energy systems.

AB The tandem cooling-compression (TCC) system possesses the potential to reduce the compression work and cooling fuel consumption in fuel indirect precooled engines. Selecting of system branch number and allocating the working fluid flow are key factors to achieve the optimum system performance. On account of this, configuration optimization for the system is carried out from the perspective of compression work minimization, with the optimum system design strategies are proposed, and the necessity of using the multi-segment precooler for efficient air precooling is clarified as well. The strategies reveal that only when the branch number and the total heat capacity ratio of the system are equal, the usual uniform flow distribution (UFD) strategy is meanwhile an optimum design choice. Based on the numerical models developed, the correctness of the proposed strategies is verified by Differential-Evolution algorithm, with the potential advantages of which are evaluated also at both the component and system levels. Compared with the UFD strategy, the results indicate that generally, the compression work and cooling fuel consumption can be further reduced, and also the operational range can be remarkably extended for the system designed with the proposed optimum strategies. Moreover, assisted with the multi-segment precooling scheme, the schemes can bring about even larger extent of fuel savings and air precooling depth, higher working fluid and air side pressure ratios, and ultimately considerable gains in engine performance.

AB For minute time scale solar photovoltaic (PV) power forecasting, the motion of clouds over PV power plant mainly contribute to the fluctuant and intermittent nature of solar PV power output. Therefore, research on cloud motion displacement (CMD) calculation to realize cloud motion prediction is a key sub-process for minute time scale solar PV power forecasting approaches. Fourier phase correlation theory (FPCT) is widely applied in CMD calculation for its superiority of simplicity and less computation, then an improved algorithm based on image-phase-shift-invariance (IPSI) is proposed to reduce the outlier probability of CMD results. However, at present, the current IPSI algorithm still has limitations and cannot avoid the occurrence of outliers altogether. In this paper, we presented a novel method, termed IPSI based multi-transform-fusion (MTF) method, to further improve the effectiveness compared with traditional FPCT and affine transform based IPSI method. First, three image transform methods satisfying IPSI condition, respectively wavelet transform (WT), affine transform (AT), and convolution transform (CT), are explored. Then the information increment of the transformed sky images using the above three methods is analyzed, respectively. Second, we determine the suitable image transform method for IPSI algorithm under specific cloud condition according to the corresponding information increment. Third, an IPSI based MTF method for CMD calculation in sky images is proposed. The original sky images are transformed through WT, AT, and CT to generate multiple images that maintain the same object motion information, then calculate the CMDs in each generated image. Finally, we apply Gaussian distribution to fit the multiple CMD values and taking its mathematical expectation as final CMD result. Various experimental results in 4 different scenarios show that the performance of the proposed approach is better than FPCT, AT based IPSI, and OF method, by reducing plenty of CMD outliers, thus delivering greater accuracy and robustness.

AB In this study, a novel transcritical-subcritical parallel organic Rankine cycle system is proposed to recover the engine exhaust gas and coolant waste heat. Firstly, the proposed system is compared with the dual-loop organic Rankine cycle and parallel organic Rankine cycle systems. According to the results, the proposed system shows more net power output, higher thermal and exergy efficiency, and lower heat transfer requirement. Then the thermodynamic analysis including energy and exergy analysis are carried out, and the effects of design parameters including high-pressure turbine inlet temperature and pressure, low-pressure evaporation temperature on the performance of proposed system based on R601a are investigated. The results indicate that for a given high-pressure turbine inlet temperature, the net power output of system firstly increases and then decreases as high-pressure turbine inlet pressure increases and reaches to the maximum at turbine inlet temperature and pressure of 520 K and 8 MPa, and the net power output also shows a trend of firstly increasing and then decreasing with low-pressure evaporation temperature and reaches to the maximum at 330 K. Furthermore, five low global warming potential fluids are selected as working fluids of proposed system, and the results demonstrate that the R1233zd is the best candidate working fluid for proposed system. The maximum net power output of proposed system based on R1233zd reaches to 119.72 kW at the turbine inlet temperature and pressure of 530 K and 10 MPa, low-pressure evaporation temperature of 330 K, which achieves net power output increment of 12.02% for the engine system. Finally, an exergy destruction analysis demonstrates that the heat transfer processes have less exergy destruction for proposed system based on R1233zd compared with other working fluids.

AB Utilising diversified forms of energy in combination with advanced energy conversions and thermal energy storages is an effective way of developing high energy-efficient renewable systems for green buildings. In this study, a novel hybrid system for the energy cascade utilisation has been proposed, integrating the hybrid ventilations, the active photovoltaic cooling, the radiative cooling and the phase change materials' storages. An enthalpy-based numerical modelling using the finite-difference method, which has been developed earlier, was used to characterize the sophisticated heat transfer process. A generic optimization methodology with competitive computational efficiency was applied by implementing the supervised machine learning and the advanced optimization algorithm. Multivariable optimizations for geometrical and operating parameters have been conducted and contrasted between the teaching-learning-based optimization and the particle swarm optimization. The results illustrate that the developed artificial neural network-based data-driven learning algorithm is more accurate and more computational-efficient than the traditional 'lsqcurvefit' fitting methodology for the characterization of the optimization function. In addition, the optimal case through the teaching-learning-based optimization is more robust than the optimal case through the particle swarm optimization in terms of the equivalent overall energy generation. This study presents a novel hybrid system for the energy cascade utilisation and a new generic optimization methodology, which are important for the promotion of green buildings with high efficiency of renewable energy utilisation.

AB We performed an extensive survey of total organic carbon (OC) and stable OC composition of in the deep South China Sea sediments from the International Ocean Discovery Program (IODP) Expedition 349 Sites U1431, U1433 and Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) Leg 184 Site 1148. Our results reveal dramatic spatial and temporal variations in organic geochemical characteristics among the three Sites. Before similar to 8 Ma, OC deposited at Site U1431 may be predominantly terrigenous, whereas OC deposited at Sites U1433 and 1148 is mainly of marine origin. After similar to 8 Ma, OC accumulation at the three Sites progressively increases, mainly due to enhancement of marine primary productivity and input of terrestrial organic matter; the three sites receive mainly marine OC, whereas Sites U1433 and 1148 receive relatively more terrestrial OC compared with Site 1431. Additionally, methane concentrations vary from similar to 20 to similar to 100,000 ppmv at Site U1433 and from similar to 10 to similar to 600 ppmv at Site 1148 with higher geothermal gradients (78 and 84 degrees C/km, respectively). In contrast, methane concentrations are < 5 ppmv at Site U1431 with lower geothermal gradient (14.8 degrees C/km). Such high methane concentrations and ratios of methane to ethane at Site U1433 suggest that the gaseous hydrocarbons in the southwestern sub basin (deep water depth, > 4000 km) are primarily sourced from microbial production. Our findings suggest that the sources, trajectories, and fates of OC buried in the deep South China Sea since the mid-Miocene are spatially and temporally variable, controlled by sedimentological processes in the sub-basins, and regional tectonic evolution and long-term paleoenvironmental changes.

AB Maastrichtian to Paleocene shallow-water carbonate rocks are common in many parts of Turkey. The occurrence of the Sahinkaya Member limestones in the Cayirbagi-Calkoy (Duzkoy/Trabzon) district of the Sakarya Zone represents the neritic expression in marginal areas of a more extensive back-arc deposition, dominated by the hemipelagic sediments of the Tonya Formation. In this contribution, the larger Foraminifera biostratigraphy of the Sahinkaya Member is revisited in order to define the presence of hiatuses associated with the Eastern Pontides arc-continent collision. The study presented here allows for the definition of an upper Maastrichtian and an overlying Paleocene sequence. They are separated from each other by an unconformity of regional meaning extending between the uppermost Maastrichtian to the lower Danian. Shallow Benthic Zones 1-3 (upper Danian to lower Thanetian) have been recognized. The stratigraphy of the Sahinkaya Member and the paleoenvironmental distribution of some larger Foraminifera suggest that, unlike other areas of the Eastern Pontides, the Paleocene deposition was ongoing but still influenced by regional tectonism.

AB Six plutons of granitic to gabbroic rocks have been recognised in the poorly exposed ground of north and east Singapore using new data from borehole cores and field observations. Five of the plutons were emplaced sequentially during the period 285-230 Ma, and these have been grouped within a single parent unit (Bukit Timah Centre) in a new lithodemic framework for Singapore. These plutons record the development of early Permian to Triassic arc-related magmatism towards the southern end of the Sukhothai Arc system of Thailand, Peninsular Malaysia and Indonesia. Compositional trends in the plutons record decreasing crustal contribution as the arc matured. The volcanosedimentary succession underlying southwest Singapore records contemporaneous deposition in the forearc basin, and includes pyroclastic units of sufficient thickness and extent to be assigned 'member' status in a new lithostratigraphical framework for Singapore. The largest pyroclastic unit, which is > 150 m thick, developed as volcanic activity peaked at c. 242 Ma and is correlated with a large (probably caldera-forming) eruption of one of the Permo-Triassic plutons. The composition, typology and age of the Bukit Timah Centre plutons confirm their affinity with Eastern Belt intrusions of the Eastern Province (one of three granitoid provinces in Southeast Asia), and support a widely accepted model that Eastern Province granitoids formed in an Andean-type setting as Palaeo-Tethys crust descended beneath the Indochina-East Malaya block. Widespread development of hydrothermal-tuffisite in the Permo-Triassic intrusions is correlated tentatively with rapid uplift following slab breakoff, when arc activity ceased in the Singapore region in the interval c. 230-205 Ma. A sixth pluton, much younger than (and unrelated to) the Bukit Timah Centre, was emplaced in northeast Singapore in the Upper Cretaceous.

AB The 2016 M6.2 Hutubi Earthquake is an event occurred on a reverse fault located in the northern Chinese Tien Shan, but it is debatable whether the seismogenic fault is a low-angle thrust fault. The coseismic strain responses have been recorded by nine 4-component RZB borehole strainmeters, locating 11-320 km away from the epi-center. The nearest four stations have recorded resolvable static strain responses. The authors used the theoretic tide to calibrate the strains, and relocated the 10.31 km by 6.85 km fault plane through a grid-search method. Two groups of fault parameters 279 degrees/70 degrees/87 degrees and 103 degrees/28 degrees/85 degrees were obtained, and the predictions for 24/26 channels for both groups are consistent with the offsets observed in the near stations by correcting the azimuths. The seismogenic fault is more likely the high-angle backthrust fault based on the comparison with the selected aftershocks. Furthermore, all strainmeters have recorded the dynamic strain waves. The dynamic strains are sensitive to the seismic wave propagation direction, and the peak dynamic strains decay faster in the N-S direction than that in the E-W direction due to the regional structure features. The absolute static strains are comparable to the dynamic strains in the near field, but the ratios between them decrease remarkably in the intermediate and far field. The difference in the dependence on distance was found to be useful to differentiate static strains from dynamic strains.

TI Constraints of zircon U-Pb and biotite Rb-Sr ages and P-T conditions on

AB The North China Craton underwent exceptional lithospheric thinning. A debate remains as to the mechanism and timing of this thinning partly as a result of the lack of information on the crustal uplift. Mantle-derived mafic rocks can carry key messages of lithospheric thinning and facilitate the determination of the time and mechanism. Gabbroic rocks from the Jinan area in eastern North China were emplaced in the peak period of the thinning and, for this reason, were chosen as the study object. Isotopic ages and P-T conditions of the Jinan gabbro pluton were measured to examine the uplifting and cooling history of the magma. Jinan gabbros were enriched in large ion lithophile elements and large rare earth elements but depleted in high field strength elements without a significant Eu anomaly. Their Sr-Nd-Pb isotopic features suggest that the magma was derived from the partial melting of an enriched lithospheric mantle (EMI). This pluton was emplaced at 130 Ma, and crystallization temperatures of pyroxene and biotite were 909-1116 degrees C and 828-952 degrees C, respectively. The core and rim crystallization pressures of clinopyroxene and plagioclase are similar to 4.45 kbar and similar to 2.56-3.91 kbar, respectively. These might record the pressure changes during the uplift process from similar to 16.5 to similar to 9.5 km. The Rb-Sr isotopic system of biotite was closed at similar to 121-117 Ma, constrained by the single-grain biotite Rb-Sr ages. This shows that the cooling depth of pluton is similar to 8.4 +/- 2.4 km. Consequently, the pluton was rapidly uplifted from the similar to 16.5 km to similar to 8.4 km, at an uplift rate of similar to 0.81 +/- 0.24 km/Ma and/or a cooling rate of approximately 50 degrees C/Ma during 130-120 Ma. This fast uplift was related to the delamination and thinning of the lithosphere that caused activities associated with magmatism and mineralization in eastern North China during the late Mesozoic.

AB We report new apatite fission track (AFT) ages and thermal modeling results from the central Songpan-Ganzi, central and easternmost Lhasa, and eastern Qiangtang blocks to provide robust constraints on the extent and expansion of the Proto-Tibetan Plateau. Our results reveal two main stages of rapid cooling events in different geological units. The central Songpan-Ganzi, central Lhasa and eastern Qiangtang blocks underwent a phase of rapid cooling event during the Paleocene-Early Eocene (similar to 62-40 Ma) followed by extremely slow cooling since then. Such a sharp transition from relatively rapid to very slow cooling in approximately 40 Ma in a large area, suggest the eastern part of the Proto-Tibetan Plateau had formed since 40 Ma. The easternmost Lhasa block experienced a stage of rapid cooling during the Late Eocene-Oligocene (similar to 40-24 Ma). This stage of rapid cooling event was coeval with the first stage of rapid cooling event in the Longmen Shan thrust belt, suggestive of the eastward expansion of the eastern part of the Proto-Tibetan Plateau. Our Paleogene AFT ages and their corresponding rapid exhumation, synthesized with other thermochronological and paleoaltimetry data, are not consistent with those of the predictions from the channel flow model. Instead, these observations favor the outward extrusion model. The eastward expansion of the Proto-Tibetan Plateau improved the previous northward and southward growth model.

AB Crustal extension along north-south graben characterizes active deformation within the central Tibetan Plateau. However, the geodynamic significance of these fault systems remains uncertain, in part reflecting sparse data regarding the onset of extension, rate(s) of slip, and paleoseismic histories along these faults. The Dong Co fault is located to the north of the dextral Beng Co fault in central Tibet. Based on the interpretation of satellite images, we use unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) topographic surveying and C-14 dating of two offset fluvial terraces to characterized active slip along the Dong Co fault of 1.2 +0.3/-0.3 on and 3.7 +0.5/-0.4 m during the past 550-1060 yr BP and 3880-6290 yr BP, respectively. These results indicate that the slip rate of the Dong Co fault during the latter half of the Holocene has been 0.7 +0.3/-0.2 mm/yr. Fault displacement and scaling relationships imply that the most recent earthquake was approximately Mw similar to 7.0. Together with the dextral Beng Co fault system, the Dong Co fault appears to record stretching of a wedge-shaped domain bounded by conjugate strike-slip faults. Our study supports models in which extension along normal faults can accommodate differential stretching between conjugate strike-slip faults.

AB Investigations of geometry and kinematics of foreland fold-and-thrust belts provide key information for understanding how convergence is accommodated in deformed forelands of orogenic belts. Here, we present the structural styles, deformation ages and shortening rates of three en echelon anticlines located at the west end of the Baicheng-Kuqa foreland fold-and-thrust belt. The results indicate that the three anticlines developed above the Eocene evaporites of the Kumugeliemu Group which constitute the decollement level in this typical thin-skinned tectonics. The initial growth of the East Awate and North Kalayuergun anticlines, as indicated by the syn-tectonic growth strata accumulations, occurred at similar to 5.3 Ma with shortening rates of similar to 0.70-0.77 mm/yr and similar to 0.40-0.43 mm/yr, respectively. Whereas, the initial folding time of the Middle Kalayuergun anticline is similar to 2.6-1.7 Ma, resulting in a shortening rate of similar to 0.35-0.65 mm/yr. The shortening rates are lower when compared with foreland deformation in the middle and eastern parts of the Baicheng-Kuqa fold-and-thrust belt. Such differences are mostly related to the strain partitioning caused by the NW-SE dextral strike-slip Kalayuergun fault as well as the influence of a dextral wrenching component in the west end of the Baicheng-Kuqa fold-and-thrust belt. Our study suggests that episodic tectonic deformation in the southern foreland of Tian Shan has been a response to the ongoing India-Asia convergence since the latest Miocene, and the spatial variability of crustal shortening rates has depended on regional tectonic differences.

AB The Upper Triassic Xujiahe Formation is a succession of continental clastic rocks in the western Sichuan Basin, China. This formation has previously been regarded as deposited in a foreland basin linked to the NE-SW-striking Longmen Shan Thrust Belt. However, this hypothesis is questionable due to the presence of faults within the Longmen Shan Thrust Belt. Focusing on the Late Triassic proto-basin, we obtained new data from both outcrops and boreholes, which provide information on the sedimentary facies and provenance in the basin. The results show that the basin was originally striking E-W and that the depocentre migrated southward during the Late Triassic. Palaeocurrent indicators and detrital zircon age data reveal that the Upper Triassic strata were derived mainly from the Qinling Orogenic Belt, with a minor component of detritus derived from the South China Block. Detrital zircon U-Pb ages of similar to 228 Ma, from the bottom of the Xujiahe Formation, constrain the timing of onset of clastic deposition. Our results suggest that the Late Triassic western Sichuan Basin was a foreland basin at the southern front of the Qinling Orogenic Belt.

AB The Cenozoic outward growth of the Tibetan Plateau is traditionally considered to be responsible for the arcuate structures in the northeastern Tibetan Plateau. However, it is still unclear how pre-Cenozoic tectonics contributed to this unique geomorphic setting. To decipher the Meso-Cenozoic tectonic evolution, we systematically summarize the published thermochronological data and perform a low-temperature thermochronology study on Paleozoic-Mesozoic samples from the Haiyuan-Liupanshan region. Apatite fission-track ages from the new samples vary widely, ranging from 158.4 Ma to 34.4 Ma. Apatite fission-track and (U-Th-Sm)/He thermal history modeling, constrained by zircon fission-track data and geological evidence, indicate that this area experienced multiple stages of cooling from the Late Triassic to the Cenozoic. These cooling events include (i) Late Triassic Early Jurassic, (ii) Late Jurassic-Early Cretaceous, (iii) Late Cretaceous-Early Cenozoic, and (iv) Late Cenozoic (similar to 7 Ma). Late Triassic-Early Jurassic cooling was driven by the collision of the Nouth China Plate and the Sorth China Plate. The Late Jurassic-Early Cretaceous tectonothermal event is interpreted as a record of the intracontinental orogeny in East Asia. It is possible that Late Cretaceous-Early Cenozoic exhumation was the far field response to the Neo-Tethyan subduction under the Lhasa terrane. In addition, Late Cenozoic (similar to 7 Ma) rapid cooling in the Yueliangshan Range (southern part of the Haiyuan-Liupanshan region) was a result of the intense activation of the easternmost Haiyuan fault, in response to the outward growth of the Tibetan Plateau. These findings suggest that pre-Cenozoic tectonics played an important role in the growth of the present-day northeastern Tibetan Plateau edifice.

AB North China is located on the N-S seismic belt of mainland China and is characterized by dense faults and intense seismicity. We analyzed the current regional crustal deformation using GPS observations from 1999 to 2007 and 2011-2017. We then established a dynamic finite element model based on the geological structure, geophysical parameters, and GPS velocity constraints to analyze the strain-stress features. Finally, we discuss the rationality of the simulation results, the variations in crustal activity, which may have been caused by the post-earthquake impact of the 2011 Mw 9.0 Tohoku and 2008 Mw 7.9 Wenchuan earthquakes, and the geodynamics of North China. Most parts of North China exhibited extensional stress in an approximately NW SE direction during 2011-2017. In the two study periods, the maximum shear strain rates predominantly occurred in western North China; the central and eastern parts had relatively smaller values in 2011-2017. These characteristics indicate that the post-earthquake impact of the Tohoku earthquake significantly influenced most parts (central and eastern) of North China, whereas the Wenchuan earthquake mainly affected the western part. Our work quantitatively described the variations in current crustal movement velocities, stress-strain fields, and fault activity rates in North China. These characteristics indicate that the unique tectonic environment, intense crustal activity, and earthquake-prone nature of North China require continuous research attention. The results obtained in this study not only portray the current tectonic activity deformations but also reveal recent geodynamic processes in North China.

AB Global geoidal undulations are often used as the constraining parameter to model the mantle convection pattern, while gravity data are typically applied to interpret the lithospheric structure. In more recent studies, especially after launching the Gravity field and steady-state Ocean Circulation Explorer (GOCE) satellite gravity-gradiometry mission, gravity gradient measurements have also been used in various geoscience applications. The main motivation of using gravity gradients is to provide a more conclusive information about a spatial localization of investigated phenomena. In geophysical studies, such implications are particularly related to a probably better detection of investigated lithospheric structures, such as active tectonic margins. In this study, we address this aspect by comparing interpretational characteristics from gravity and gravity gradient information. The Bouguer and mantle gravity gradients are used for this purpose to interpret the lithospheric structure beneath the Indian Ocean as well as the (adjacent) continental lithospheric structures (such as the East African Rift System). Our results confirm that gravity gradient more closely reproduces some tectonic and volcanic features, such as oceanic subductions, volcanic island arcs, and convergent continental tectonic margins. Similarly, mid-oceanic spreading ridges are localized slightly better in the gravity gradient map. Our findings also indicate that the interpretational quality cannot be improved by using directly observed gravity gradients. The reason is that these interpretations require applying gravimetric forward modelling techniques in order to enhance a particular lithospheric structure.

AB The mixture of the Cathaysian and Angaran floras signifies the evolution of the Paleo-Asian Ocean (PAO). In this study, we present new zircon U-Pb-Hf isotope analyses from the Jiefangcun Formation, Sidonggou Formation, Kedao Group, and Kaishantun Formation in the Yanbian area, NE China. The Kaishantun Formation contains the Kaishantun flora, which is dominated by the Cathaysian flora with a few Angaran elements. The Jiefangcun Formation is characterized by the Jiefangcun flora, which is dominated by the Angaran taxa and contains some Cathaysian elements. The ages of these strata are widely accepted as Permian. However, in this study, the youngest zircon ages of the rock samples from the Jiefangcun Formation, Kedao Group and Sidonggou Formation are 243-245 Ma. Only the Kaishantun Formation is assigned to the Late Permian. The Kaishantun Formation has age peaks at 758, 934, 1856, and 2493 Ma with negative epsilon(Hf)(t) values, and this formation is therefore mainly derived from the North China Craton (NCC). In contrast, the Kedao Group and Jiefangcun Formation have zircon age peaks at similar to 260, 338 and similar to 460 Ma with positive and negative epsilon(Hf)(t) values, at 800-1000 Ma with mostly positive epsilon(Hf)(t) values, and at similar to 1800 Ma with positive and negative epsilon(Hf)(t) values, which suggest bidirectional provenances, including the Jiamusi-Mongolia Block and the NCC. Thus, the mixing between the Angaran and Cathaysian floras occurred during the Late Permian-Middle Triassic, suggesting a scissor-like closure model of the PAO, and the Solonker suture zone extends eastward to the Yanbian area with bidirectional subduction of the PAO.

AB Post-collisional magmatism in western Anatolia produced several granitic bodies represented by shallow level intrusions. In this study, we present field, geochronology and geothermo-barometry results of the Solarya Pluton (SP, NW Turkey) in order to better understand its emplacement into the different levels of the crust. The SP consists of three main plutonic members showing different textural properties; the northern part of the plutonic body is represented by K-feldspar megacrystalline granodiorite (KFMG) with distinct porphyritic texture and southern part is made up of microgranite-granodiorite (MGG) displaying microgranular texture whereas haplogranite, which displays graphic/granophyric textures, is represented by a thin aureole between the SP and basement rocks.
   Field relations, petrography and geothermo-barometry studies combined with Ar-40/Ar-39 and U-Pb zircon dating results suggest that different members of the SP were emplaced into different levels of crust with different mechanisms. The KFMG (Ar-40/Ar-39 - 23.2 Ma, U-Pb - 21.8 Ma) began its emplacement forcefully in the relatively deeper levels in the crust (av. 1.65 kbar; av. 797 degrees C; 6.1 km depth). After this stage, MGG (Ar-40/Ar-39 22.6 Ma, U-Pb - 21.2 Ma) was passively emplaced into the shallow levels (av. 0.69 kbar; ay. 745 degrees C; 2.4 km depth) via cauldron subsidence and in the latter stages the sheet intrusive rocks (haplogranite Ar-40/Ar-39 - 21.6 Ma and hypabyssal association) were emplaced into the ring faults at 1.5 km depth. Forceful to passive emplacement of the SP into the upper crust occurred under Aegean extensional tectonics. Our study contributes to examination of the granite ascent and emplacement within other extensional provinces worldwide.

AB Investigation of major unconformities and large-scale palaeo-uplifts that developed during basin deformation is key in determining the geodynamic setting and hydrocarbon accumulation. Based on the integral analysis of seismic, logging, and outcrop data, the distribution and erosion amounts of Mesozoic major unconformities, the uplifts of the Tabei Uplift and the geodynamic setting in the Kuqa-Tabei region of the Tarim Basin are documented in this study. The Tabei Uplift underwent four stages of uplifts, resulting in four regional angular unconformities and significant changes in palaeo-geomorphology. The deformation occurring at the end of the Permian is characterised by the uplift in the Midwest and the development of an angular unconformity (TT) with maximum erosion thickness of 1200 m. Another deformation occurred at the end of the Triassic, leading to significant uplift of the palaeo-uplift and producing an extensive angular unconformity (TJ) with maximum denudation thickness of 400 m. The end-Jurassic deformation resulted in another uplifting along the palaeo-uplift and generated a regional unconformity (TIC) with maximum erosion thickness of 500 m. The Late Cretaceous deformation is characterised mainly by the development of the Wensu Palaeo-uplift in the western margin of the study area. The associated angular unconformity (TE) has a limited distribution mainly along the palaeo-uplift with maximum erosion thickness of 300 m. Four stages of uplifts are attributed to the Palaeo-Tethys oceanic closure; the Qiangtang collision; the Lhasa collision; and the Kohistan collision, respectively. Triangular unconformity belts in the paleo-uplift slope area are favourable for petroleum accumulation.

AB Palaeokarsts contain important information about subaerial exposures due to sea-level regression, which has been considered as a dominant genesis of reservoirs. Herein we describe a typical sedimentary core section of the Middle Ordovician Majiagou Formation that records multi-stage penecontemporaneous karstification in North China. Petrographic observations and stable isotopic data reveal high-frequency penecontemporaneous subaerial exposure and resulting karstification. Evidence for this includes erosional surfaces, gypsum breccias, facies-controlled dissolution vugs and vadose infillings, fabric-selective dissolution, and negative carbon and oxygen isotopic excursions. Karstification generally occurred in the middle and upper parts of an upward-shallowing sequence within a single depositional cycle, leading to meteoric water dissolution of shoals and mounds. This significantly enlarged the primary pores and generated new reservoir space. As such, high-quality hydrocarbon reservoirs became well developed, which are regularly and cyclically stacked at locations a few meters below the multiple exposure surfaces. Reservoir porosity also varies systematically with the high-frequency sedimentary cycles, and is generally at a maximum in the middle and upper parts of a cycle. The multi-stage penecontemporaneous subaerial exposure and resulting karstification reflect high-frequency changes in relative sea level in North China at this time, thereby providing a framework for identifying thin carbonate reservoirs in and around the Ordos Basin.

AB Geochemical data for hydrate gases acquired from the GMGS3 and GMGS4 gas hydrate drilling expeditions conducted by the Guangzhou Marine Geological Survey (GMGS) are used to explore the origin of hydrate gases and their relationship to deep hydrocarbon reservoirs, and to evaluate the contribution of different genetic types of gases to the formation and accumulation of gas hydrates in the Shenhu area of the northern part of the South China Sea (SCS). Compositionally, methane is the dominant gas (> 90%) in the void gas and pressure core gas. In addition, as much as similar to 3% of the gas is composed of C2+ hydrocarbons, including ethane, propane, iso-butane, butane, iso-pentane, and n-pentane. The delta C-13-CH4 and delta D-CH4 values indicate a mixed biogenic-thermogenic origin for the hydrate-forming gas. The methane isotope correlation indicates that the source of the hydrate gas is closely related to the deep conventional gas reservoirs discovered in the Baiyun Sag-Panyu Low Uplift area. Both the hydrate gases and the deep reservoir gases are sourced from the hydrocarbon kitchens in the Baiyun Sag, revealing a paragenetic relationship within the same petroleum system. The composition of the hydrocarbons and the isotopic variation of methane with depth suggest that the thermogenic gas was likely affected by compositional and isotopic fractionation during the long-distance migration from the deep source rocks to the shallow gas hydrate stability zone (GHSZ). The impact of biodegradation on a solely thermogenic gas could also affect the final composition of the hydrate-forming gas. Analysis of the GHSZ based on gas hydrate compositions suggests that the occurrence of thermogenic gas could also indicate the coexistence of structure I (S-I) and structure II (S-II) gas hydrates in the Shenhu area, with the So hydrates accumulating in or below the lower part of the Si GHSZ. The confirmed presence of So hydrates in the Shenhu area relocated the base of the GHSZ deeper than was indicated by the bottom simulating reflector, which warrants further study in future explorations for gas hydrates in the Shenhu area.

AB The occurrence of A-type granites following adakitic granites can provide unique insights into the tectonic evolution of subduction zone. This paper presents a comprehensive study of zircon U-Pb-Hf isotopes and whole rock geochemistry on the Neoproterozoic gabbro-diorites, biotite granites, and K-feldspar granites in the southwestern margin of the Yangtze Block, South China. Zircon U-Pb dating of three distinctive intrusions yield concordant ages of 810 +/- 4 2.0 Ma for gabbro-diorites, 800.3 +/- 2.1 Ma for biotite granites, and 749.1 +/- 2.0 Ma for K-feldspar granites. The gabbro-diorites are sodic and calc-alkaline rocks with low SiO2 (52.62-53.87 wt%), medium MgO (2.67-3.41 wt%), high Fe2O3T (7.18-7.49 wt%) and CaO (5.68-7.50 wt%) contents. They display high Th/Zr and Rb/Y ratios but low Nb/Zr and Nb/Y ratios. Together with their positive whole-rock epsilon Nd(t) (+1.0 to +1.5) and zircon epsilon(Hf)(t) values (+3.66 to +8.18), we suggest that these gabbro-diorites were derived from the partial melting of depleted lithospheric mantle modified by subduction-related fluids. The biotite granites display relatively high Sr contents (335-395 ppm), Sr/Y ratios (38.9-54.3), low Y (7.04-9.71 ppm) and Yb contents (0.78-1.08 ppm), resembling the adakitic granites. Their low Mg-# (36-41) values, Cr (2.94-3.59 ppm) and Ni (1.32-1.55 ppm) contents as well as positive eNd(t) (+0.5 to +0.6) and eHf (t) values (+1.62 to +8.07) indicate that they were formed by partial melting of thickened juvenile mafic lower crust, probably within the existence of garnet. The K-feldspar granites have high SiO2 (76.61-77.14 wt%) and alkalis (Na2O + K2O = 8.55-9.69 wt%) contents, high 10,000* Ga/Al (2.56-2.80) ratios and differentiation index (95.3-96.9), indicating the affinity to highly fractionated A-type granites. We suggest that these A-type granites were mainly generated by the partial melting of felsic crustal rocks under low pressure condition and subsequently extensive fractional crystallization is significant. Taking into account previous studies from the western Yangtze Block, South China, we propose that the gabbro-diorites, adakitic granites and A-type granites in this study were formed in persistent subduction process during the Neoproterozoic.

AB Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a chronic inflammatory disorder with a course that is not uniform for all COPD patients. Although smoking is considered as the major cause of the disease, persistent or recurrent infections seem to play a particular role in the disease establishment and progression. COPD is characterized by dysregulated immunity that has been associated with the bacterial colonization and infections.
   The establishment of culture-independent techniques has shed new light on the relationships between bacterial ecology and health status and expanded our knowledge on the lung microbiome. Interactions between the host and lung microbiome result in inflammation and activation of resident cells. The lung microbiome contains populations of symbionts and pathobionts in balance which lose their equilibrium and disturb the balance of T-helper and regulatory T-cells (Treg) upon infection, or lung disease. In COPD factors such as disease severity, exacerbations, degree of inflammation, and type of treatment used (e.g inhaled or systemic steroids and antibiotics) affect the composition of lung microbiota. Recent data indicate that the presence of specific bacterial taxa in the airways has the potential to influence the host immune response and possibly to interfere with disease phenotype. Although, there is a growing body of evidence for the role of microbiome in COPD several unanswered questions still exist for its clinical relevance.

AB A chylothorax, also known as chylous pleural effusion, is an uncommon cause of pleural effusion with a wide differential diagnosis characterized by the accumulation of bacteriostatic chyle in the pleural space. The pleural fluid will have either or both triglycerides > 110 mg/dL and the presence of chylomicrons. It may be encountered following a surgical intervention, usually in the chest, or underlying disease process. Management of a chylothorax requires a multidisciplinary approach employing medical therapy and possibly surgical intervention for post-operative patients and patients who have failed medical therapy. In this review, we aim to discuss the anatomy, fluid characteristics, etiology, and approach to the diagnosis of a chylothorax.

AB Lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM) is a rare diffuse lung cystic disease (DLCD) that occurs sporadically or in association with Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC). The diagnostic pathway is tracked on the identification of the disease hallmarks on chest High-Resolution Computed Tomography (HRCT).
   Aim of this review is to discuss the thoracic HRCT pathognomonic features, essential to rule out other DLCD. It also examines the new evidences emerging from Computed Tomography (CT) quantitative studies that, by demonstrating a specific cysts distribution and a pathological aspect of the parenchyma near the cysts, could improve our understanding of this rare disorder and supply pulmonologists with a new tool for a more appropriate long-term management. Finally, the contribution of other image techniques as low dose chest CT, Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and Ultrasound (US) is discussed.

AB Background: In adults, measurement of FENO has been recently suggested as a substitute for the methacholine challenge test (MCT) for diagnosis of asthma. This study aimed to evaluate whether FeNO is a substitute for MCH also in children with suspicious asthma.
   Methods: During a single visit steroid naive children (5-17 years) with suspicious asthma underwent skin prick test (SPT), FENO measurement and spirometry prior and during MCT (one concentration procedure). Results of the SPT (atopy/non-atopy) and MCT (asthma/non-asthma) were used for categorization. ROC analysis in atopy non-atopy subgroups yielded sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive value (PPV and NPV) for FENO.
   Results: The SPT revealed atopy in 134 out of 222 children (age 9.7 +/- 3.2 years) investigated and asthma was diagnosed in 114 (77/37 atopy/non-atopy) patients. FENO values in patients with atopic asthma were significantly higher compared to those with either non-atopic asthma or atopia without asthma (18 ppb (5-89) vs 7 ppb (5-36); p < 0.001; 18 ppb (5-89) vs 11 ppb (5-98); p < 0.05). Sensitivity and specificity of FENO for diagnosing atopic asthma (FENO >= 15.5 ppb; AUC = 0.635, p < 0.01) were 61.1% and 64.9% and non-atopic asthma (FENO >= 6.5 ppb; AUC = 0.445, p = 0.382) 54.1% and 39.2%, respectively. The PPV/NPV for FENO were 0.70/0.55 in atopy and 0.39/0.54 in non-atopy patients, respectively.
   Conclusion: In children, FENO is not appropriate to substitute for the MCT. However, in patients with a negative SPT a FENO in the normal range makes the presence of atopic asthma unlikely.

AB Objectives: To evaluate whether elevated levels of cardiac troponin increases the risk of mortality in patients with acute PE.
   Methods: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis with rigorous statistical evaluation using publications (2000-2018) from Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and Google Scholar databases. We searched for retrospective, prospective, and randomized controlled trials (RCT) or quasi-RCT studies that assessed the effect of elevated troponin versus normal levels on the outcomes of PE. The main outcome of interest was all-cause mortality. Extracted data included authors, the origin of studies, source population, study settings and duration, inclusion/exclusion criteria, data sources and measurement, sample size, and mortality. Data heterogeneity was assessed using the Cochrane Q homogeneity test with a significance set at p < 0.10. If the studies were statistically homogeneous, a fixed effect model was selected.
   Results: Out of 1825 references, 46 analytical studies were included with a total of 10842 patients with PE. The effect of elevated troponin on mortality had a pooled odd ratio (OR) of 4.33 for all studies, 3.7 for HsTnT, 14.81 for HsTnI, 7.85 for cTnT, 2.81 for cTnI, 9.02 for low-risk PE and 4.80 for 90-day mortality. The pooled negative likelihood ratios for all-cause mortality using HsTnI, cTnI and cTnT assay were 0.21, 0.33 and 0.65, respectively.
   Conclusion: Regardless of the troponin assay, pooled analysis indicates that elevated troponin is significantly associated with higher mortality in patients with PE.

   Methods: In a retrospective study, we included 28 patients with severe asthma (61.5 +/- 16.2 years, FEV1: 51.4 +/- 17.3%) and 164 matched COPD patients (64.3 +/- 11.6 years, FEV1: 47.7 +/- 15.5%) who had completed a home-based PR program and pursued at least 12 months of follow-up. The number of steps performed during a 6-min stepper test (6MST), the Hospital Anxiety and Depression (HAD) scores, and the Visual Simplified Respiratory Questionnaire score (VSRQ) were compared between baseline, the post-PR period (post-PR) and after 12 months of follow-up (M12) within each group. The evolution of the 6MST, HAD and VSRQ values between baseline, post-PR and M12 was compared between severe asthma and COPD patients.
   Results: In the severe asthma group, the 6MST was higher post-PR (504 +/- 150, p = 0.043) and at M12 (538 +/- 163, p = 0.016) compared with baseline (450 +/- 148). The VSRQ score was higher at M12 (39.0 +/- 18.6, p = 0.049) but not post-PR (38.7 +/- 15.8, p = 0.119) in comparison with baseline (32.2 +/- 12.4). There was no difference in the HAD scores between baseline, post-PR and M12. PR outcome was not significantly different between severe asthma and COPD patients at short and long term (p > 0.05).
   Conclusion: In severe asthma, home-based PR is associated with improved exercise tolerance and quality of life on a long-term basis but does not modify anxiety and depression.

TI Asthma phenotypes in a multi-ethnic Asian cohort
SO RESPIRATORY MEDICINE
LA English
DT Article
DE Ethnicity; Phenotype; Asia; Chinese; Obesity; Race
ID CLUSTER-ANALYSIS; IDENTIFICATION; CHINESE; ADULTS
AB Background: Identification of asthma phenotypes facilitates our understanding of asthma pathobiologies. Phenotypes observed in homogenous Asian cohorts have distinct differences from those described in Caucasian cohorts, suggesting that ethnicity may influence phenotypic expression. Phenotypic clusters in a multi-ethnic Southeast Asian cohort have not been described before, and direct comparisons of these clusters within a single study may reveal how ethnicity affects phenotypic expression.
   Methods: Six hundred and thirty adult asthma patients from two healthcare institutions in Singapore were randomly assigned in a 2:1 fashion to a test and validation cohort. Latent class analysis was performed on both cohorts using age of asthma onset, sex, ethnicity, smoking status, body mass index, lung function, blood eosinophil count, asthma control test score, and exacerbation frequency as input variables. Phenotypic clusters between the test and validation cohorts were compared
   Results: Three clusters were identified in both the test and validation cohorts, with corresponding clusters of each cohort sharing similar characteristics. Ethnic representation and asthma control were significantly different between clusters. Cluster one comprised Chinese females with late-onset asthma and the best asthma control. Cluster two comprised non-Chinese females with obesity and the worst asthma control. Cluster three was multi-ethnic with the greatest proportion of atopic patients.
   Conclusion: We identified three phenotypic clusters in our multi-ethnic Southeast Asian population, with distinct differences in ethnicity which may be attributable to inherent differences in baseline characteristics among ethnic groups.

TI No stone unturned: Nodule Net, an intervention to reduce loss to
   follow-up of lung nodules
SO RESPIRATORY MEDICINE
LA English
DT Article
DE Lung nodules; Lung cancer
ID PULMONARY NODULES; CANCER; MANAGEMENT
AB Objective: Inadequate lung nodule surveillance leads to diagnostic delays. We implemented a retrospective intervention program, Nodule Net, to improve surveillance in our hospital.
   Methods: 9,224 Chest computed tomography (CT) scans between January 1, 2015 and December 31, 2016 were manually reviewed for lung nodules. For patients without follow-up, charts were reviewed to assess follow-up. If follow-up appeared indicated, the clinician or patient was contacted, and follow-up was tracked.
   Results: Lung nodules were identified on 5,101 (55%) of 9,224 scans. Follow-up was potentially indicated and not completed in 1,385 (27%). 183 (13%) were excluded after imaging review. 1,202 received outreach. Of the 801 (66%) with a provider in our system, 225 (27%) returned for follow-up. Nodules were stable in 199 (88%), new or growing in 23 (11%), resolved in 3 (1%), and stage 1 lung cancer in 2 (1%). 90 (11%) had follow-up outside our system and 431 (51%) had no follow-up due to a clinical contraindication. 55 (7%) have imaging pending and 14 (2%) are awaiting pulmonary evaluation. Of the 302 (25%) patients with providers outside our system, 121 (40%) had followed-up elsewhere. 146 (48%) had no follow-up due to a clinical reason. 35 (12%) providers did not respond to outreach.
   Conclusions: We identified 1,202 patients with lung nodules who needed follow-up over a two-year period. Compliance was more successful with providers within our hospital system. We recommend robust surveillance for patients to ensure follow-up is completed and clinical contraindications are well documented.

ID PREVENTIVE THERAPY; HEPATOTOXICITY; RIFAMPIN; TRIAL
AB Introduction: There are insufficient data on the treatment of latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) in elderly patients. We investigated the completion rate of treatment in elderly LTBI patients.
   Methods: A retrospective multicentre study was conducted at five university hospitals in South Korea. We reviewed the electronic medical records of patients aged 65 years and older who were diagnosed with LTBI via positive interferon-gamma release assay results between January 2016 and December 2018. Treatment completion was defined as ingestion of more than 80% of all prescribed medications without loss to follow-up. Results: During the study period, 127 LTBI patients aged 65 years and older visited outpatient department. Among them, 77 patients aged 65-78 years (median age, 69 years [interquartile range, 66-71 years]) who received LTBI treatment were analysed. Common reasons for IGRA testing in elderly patients were health-care worker (n = 33, 42.9%) and household contact with infectious TB patients (n = 18, 23.4%).
   The overall completion rate of LTBI treatment was 83.1% (n = 64), and the completion rate of 3-month isoniazid plus rifampin regimen was 88.4%. Adverse effects were reported in 23 patients (29.9%), and an increase in aminotransferase level was the most common adverse effect (n = 11, 14.3%). Three patients (3.9%) with the adverse effect discontinued treatment and 10 (13.0%) patients were lost to follow-up.
   Conclusions: LTBI treatment in patients aged 65-78 years was relatively well tolerated. In LTBI treatment in elderly patients, the majority of discontinuation of treatment was due to loss to follow-up rather than adverse effects of anti-TB medications.

TI Effects of lung deflation induced by tiotropium/olodaterol on the
   cardiocirculatory responses to exertion in COPD

ID OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY-DISEASE; AIR-FLOW OBSTRUCTION; PERCENT EMPHYSEMA;
   OXYGEN DELIVERY; BLOOD-FLOW; EXERCISE; ATHEROSCLEROSIS; HYPERINFLATION;
   LIMITATION; IMPACT
AB Background: Hyperinflation has been associated with negative cardiocirculatory consequences in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). These abnormalities are likely to worsen when the demands for O-2 increase, e.g., under the stress of exercise. Thus, pharmacologically-induced lung deflation may improve cardiopulmonary interactions and exertional cardiac output leading to higher limb muscle blood flow and oxygenation in hyperinflated patients with COPD.
   Methods: 20 patients (residual volume = 201.6 +/- 63.6% predicted) performed endurance cardiopulmonary exercise tests (75% peak) 1 h after placebo or tiotropium/olodaterol 5/5 mu g via the Respimat (R) inhaler (Boehringer Ingelheim, Ingelheim am Rhein, Germany). Cardiac output was assessed by signal-morphology impedance cardiography. Near-infrared spectroscopy determined quadriceps blood flow (indocyanine green dye) and intra-muscular oxygenation.
   Results: Tiotropium/olodaterol was associated with marked lung deflation (p < 0.01): residual volume decreased by at least 0.4 L in 14/20 patients (70%). The downward shift in the resting static lung volumes was associated with less exertional inspiratory constraints and dyspnoea thereby increasing exercise endurance by similar to 50%. Contrary to our premises, however, neither central and peripheral hemodynamics nor muscle oxygenation improved after active intervention compared to placebo. These results were consistent with those found in a subgroup of patients showing the largest decrements in residual volume (p < 0.05).
   Conclusions: The beneficial effects of tiotropium/olodaterol on resting and operating lung volumes are not translated into enhanced cardiocirculatory responses to exertion in hyperinflated patients with COPD. Improvement in exercise tolerance after dual bronchodilation is unlikely to be mechanistically linked to higher muscle blood flow and/or O-2 delivery.

TI Mortality for sarcoidosis patients on the transplant wait list in the
   Lung Allocation Score era: Experience from a high volume center
SO RESPIRATORY MEDICINE
LA English
DT Article
DE Sarcoidosis; Lung transplantation; Wait list outcomes
ID CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS; POPULATION; OUTCOMES; SYSTEM
AB Rationale: Sarcoidosis progresses to end stage fibrotic lung disease in 10% of patients and may necessitate lung transplantation. Organ allocation is currently determined by the Lung Allocation Score (LAS), but its performance in a sarcoidosis population has not been evaluated.
   Objectives: To determine sarcoidosis-specific wait list mortality and identify predictive factors of death on the transplantation wait list.
   Methods: This was a single-center retrospective study of all sarcoidosis patients listed for lung transplant from March 2012 to February 2019. We compared patients who were transplanted to those who died awaiting organs. We collected baseline listing characteristics, physiologic testing, and outcomes data. Statistical analysis was performed by 2-tailed Student's t-test, Mann-Whitney U test, and Chi-Square analysis (where appropriate). Receiver-operating characteristic curves were constructed for variables reaching statistical significance.
   Results: Twenty eight sarcoidosis patients were included in analysis. Mortality among wait listed patients was 18%, which exceeded the mortality of COPD and IPF. LAS scores did not differ at initial listing (41 vs. 46, p = 0.35) or at transplant/death (41 vs. 41, p = 0.91); wait list times also did not statistically differ (307 days vs. 177 days, p = 0.19). We identified bilirubin (AUC = 0.92), DLCO (AUC = 0.84), FEV1/FVC at transplant/death (AUC = 0.85), and composite physiologic index (AUC = 0.86) as predictors of death on the transplant list. Pulmonary hypertension was not associated with death.
   Conclusion: Unexpected sudden death was common in our cohort and was associated with markers of advanced fibrotic disease, not pulmonary hypertension.

AB Many venom proteins have presumably been convergently recruited by taxa from diverse venomous lineages. These toxic proteins have characteristics that allow them to remain stable in solution and have a high propensity for toxic effects on prey and/or potential predators. Despite this well-established convergent toxin recruitment, some toxins seem to be lineage specific. To further investigate the toxic proteins found throughout venomous lineages, venom proteomics and venom-gland transcriptomics were performed on two individual red bark centipedes (Scolopocryptops sexspinosus). Combining the protein phenotype with the transcript genotype resulted in the first in-depth venom characterization of S. sexspinosus, including 72 venom components that were identified in both the transcriptome and proteome and 1468 nontoxin transcripts identified in the transcriptome. Ten different toxin families were represented in the venom and venom gland with the majority of the toxins belonging to metalloproteases, CAPS (cysteine-rich secretory protein, antigen 5, and pathogenesis-related 1 proteins), and beta-pore-forming toxins. Nine of these toxin families shared a similar proteomic structure to venom proteins previously identified from other centipedes. However, the most highly expressed toxin family, the adamalysin-like metalloproteases, has until now only been observed in the venom of snakes. We confirmed adamalysin-like metalloprotease activity by means of in vivo functional assays. The recruitment of an adamalysin-like metalloprotease into centipede venom represents a striking case of convergent evolution.

AB Prostate cancer (PCa) is one of the most common male cancer types, androgen-independent prostate cancer possesses poor prognosis. Buforin IIb, an attractive antibacterial peptide derived from histone H2A, showed selective cytotoxicity against most cancer cell lines. However, the molecular mechanism of buforin IIb on prostate cancer cell has still not been determined. In this study, we found buforin lIb significantly inhibited the prostate cancer cells proliferation, Furthermore, buforin IIb-induced cell apoptosis through downregulation of pro-caspase 3/8/9, poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase PARP and anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 and upregulation of proapoptotic Bax. In addition, buforin IIb increased the expression of tumor suppressor p53 and its target genes p21, fas, noxa and puma. The cytotoxicity of buforin IIb on PC-3 and Du-145 cells is decreased by p53 knockdown. In conclusion, our results indicated that buforin IIb induced PC-3 and Du-145 cell apoptosis and could be considered as a potential drug for prostate cancer.

AB This study was conducted to examine the cytotoxic effects of Nubein6.8 isolated from the venom of the Egyptian Spitting Cobra Naja nubiae on melanoma (A375) and ovarian carcinoma cell lines and to reveal its mode of action. The size of Nubein6.8 (6801.8 Da) and its N-terminal sequence are similar to cytotoxins purified from the venom of other spitting cobras. Nubein6.8 showed a high significant cytotoxic effect on A375 cell line and moderate effect on A2780. A clonogenic assay showed that Nubein6.8 has a significant long-term potency on A375 cell survival when compared to A2780. The molecular intracellular signaling pathways of Nubein6.8 have been investigated using Western blotting analysis, flow cytometry, and microscale protein labeling. This data revealed that Nubein6.8 has DNA damaging effects and the ability to activate apoptosis in both tumor cell lines. Cellular uptake recordings revealed that the labeled-Nubein6.8 was intracellularly present in A375 cells while A2780 displayed resistance against it. SEM examination showed that Nubein6.8 was found to have high accessibility to malignant melanoma cells. The apoptotic effect of Nubein6.8 was confirmed by TEM examination that revealed many evident characteristics for Nubein6.8 apoptotic efficacy on A375 cell sections. Also, TEM reflected many resistant characteristics that faced Nubein6.8 acquisition through ovarian carcinoma cell sections. Accordingly, the snake venom peptide of Nubein6.8 is a promising template for developing potential cytotoxic agents targeting human melanoma and ovarian carcinoma.

AB The expense of production and distribution of snakebite antivenom, as well as its relatively infrequent use, has caused antivenom to be increasingly difficult to obtain and ultimately producing an alarming global shortage. Unused, expired antivenom may represent a significant, untapped resource to ameliorate this crisis. This study examines the efficacy of expired antivenom over time using in vitro, whole blood clotting, and platelet function statistics. Representatives from three years for four different global brands of polyvalent antivenom were chosen and tested against their corresponding venoms as well as other venoms that could display cross-reactivity. These antivenoms include Wyeth Polyvalent (U.S.; exp. 1997, 2001, 2003), Antivipmyn (R) (Mexico; exp. 2005, 2013, 2017), Biotecfars Polyvalent (Venezuela; exp. 2010, 2014, 2016), and SAIMR (South Africa; exp. 1997, 2005, 2017). Venoms of species tested were Crotalus atrox against Wyeth; C. atrox and Crotalus vegrandis against Antivipmyn (R) ; C. atrox, C. vegrandis and Bothrops colombiensis against Biotecfar; and Bids gabonica and Echis carinatus against South African Institute for Medical Research (SAIMR). Parameters recorded were activated clotting time (ACT), clotting rate (CR), and platelet function (PF). Preliminary results are encouraging as the antivenoms maintained significant efficacy even 20 y after their expiration date. We anticipate these results will motivate further studies and provide hope in the cases of snakebite emergencies when preferable treatments are unavailable.

AB Venoms of spiders and snakes contain toxins extremely active and, thus, provide a natural source for the development of new biotechnological tools. Among the diversity of toxins present in the venom of spiders from genus Loxosceles, the phospholipases D (PLDs) show high hydrolytic activity upon lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) and sphingomyelin (SM), generating bioactive phospholipids such as cyclic phosphatidic acid (cPA). Since this mediator has been shown to play a major role in complex signaling pathways, including inhibition of tumor cells, the PLDs may hold the key to learn how toxins could be used for therapeutic purposes. However, the strong platelet aggregation of PLDs and their lack of selectivity impose a major limitation. On the other hand, disintegrins present in the venoms of Viperidae snakes are a potent inhibitor of platelet aggregation and possess high affinity and specificity to molecules called integrins that are highly expressed in some tumor cells, such as murine melanoma B16F10. Therefore, disintegrins might be suitable molecules to carry the PLDs to the malignant cells, so both toxins may work synergistically to eliminate these cells. Thus, in this work, a recombinant PLD from Loxosceles gaucho spider was recombinantly fused to a disintegrin from Echis carinatus snake to form a hybrid toxin called Rechistatin. This recombinant toxin was successfully expressed in bacteria, showed binding activity in B16F10 murine melanoma cells and exerted a synergistic cytotoxicity effect on these cells. Therefore, the approach presented in this work may represent a new strategy to explore new potential applications for spider PLDs.

AB Ozone plays an increasingly important role in food processing for its antimicrobial ability and degradation effects on mycotoxins. The mycotoxin deoxynivalenol (DON) was treated with saturated aqueous ozone for different amounts of time, and by-products were collected for compounds annotation and cytotoxicity evaluation. To investigate the cytotoxicity of ozone degradation by-products, untargeted GC-TOFMS-based metabolomics were utilized. Caco-2 cells were dosed with 0.1 mu g/mL DON and saturated aqueous ozone-treated DON (treatment time: 1 min, 3 min, 5 min) for 24 h followed by cytotoxicity tests (cell viability assay, ROS assay, and apoptosis assay), and intracellular metabolic analysis. Cytotoxicity test results revealed that ozone treatment could degrade DON structure; however, its degradation products and cellular toxicity existed under different treatment time of ozone. Metabolomics analysis indicated that ozone-treated DON degradation products weakened DON-induced metabolic disorder, such as purines-related nucleotide metabolism; Krebs cycle-related fuel and energy metabolism; and lipid, alkaloid and amino acid metabolism. By contrast, the catecholamine pathway, which is related to latent inflammation and oxidative stress effects, was unaltered in the ozone-treated DON group, indicating that the potential cytotoxicity still existed. These findings provide a comprehensive safety evaluation for ozone-treated DON in vitro and propose a new strategy for studying the effects of ozone-treated food.

AB The indole diterpenoid toxin lolitrem B is a tremorgenic agent found in the common grass species, perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne). The toxin is produced by a symbiotic fungus Epichloe festucae (var. lolii) and ingestion of infested grass with sufficient toxin levels causes a movement disorder in grazing herbivores known as 'ryegrass staggers'. Beside ataxia, lolitrem B intoxicated animals frequently show indicators of cognitive dysfunction or exhibition of erratic and unpredictable behaviours during handling. Evidence from field cases in livestock and controlled feeding studies in horses have indicated that intoxication with lolitrem B may affect higher cortical or subcortical functioning. In order to define the role of lolitrem B in voluntary motor control, spatial learning and memory under controlled conditions, mice were exposed to a known dose of purified lolitrem B toxin and tremor, coordination, voluntary motor activity and spatial learning and memory assessed. Motor activity, coordination and spatial memory were compared to tremor intensity using a novel quantitative piezo-electronic tremor analysis. Peak tremor was observed as frequencies between 15 and 25Hz compared to normal movement at approximately 1.4-10Hz. A single exposure to a known tremorgenic dose of lolitrem B (2 mg/kg IP) induced measureable tremor for up to 72 h in some animals. Initially, intoxication with lolitrem B significantly decreased voluntary movement. By 25 h post exposure a return to normal voluntary movement was observed in this group, despite continuing evidence of tremor. This effect was not observed in animals exposed to the short-acting tremorgenic toxin paxilline. Lolitrem B intoxicated mice demonstrated a random search pattern and delayed latency to escape a 3 h post intoxication, however by 27 h post exposure latency to escape matched controls and mice had returned to normal searching behavior indicating normal spatial learning and memory. Together these data indicate that the tremor exhibited by lolitrem B intoxicated mice does not directly impair spatial learning and memory but that exposure does reduce voluntary motor activity in intoxicated animals. Management of acutely affected livestock suffering toxicosis should be considered in the context of their ability to spatially orientate with severe toxicity.

AB Paralytic shellfish toxins (PSTs) are a group of the most harmful neurotoxins distributed worldwide. Marine organism samples, including mollusks, crustaceans and fish, collected from 11 sites around the coastal water of the South China Sea, were analyzed in terms of the PST and toxicity via high-performance liquid chromatography. The PST geographical distribution, detectable rate for PST and toxin content all increased slightly from 2006 to 2008 to 2015. High PST content with more than 2 nmol g(-1) appeared in Shantou (ST), Shanwei (SW), Zhanjiang (ZJ), Beihai (BH), Xuwen (XW), Haikou (HK), Dongfang (DF), Wanning (WN) and Sanya (SY). Low PST content with less than 2 nmol g(-1) appeared in Shenzhen (SZ) and Yangjiang (YJ). High PST toxicity over the safety limit 800 mu g STXeq/kg appeared in ST, SW, ZJ, BH, DF, SY and XW. PST has significant seasonal characteristics and was mostly detected in spring, early summer (March-June) and autumn (September-November) in the coastal water of the South China Sea. PST was usually detected in some specific species of scallop, mussel, bloody clam, hard clam, razor clam, oyster, crab, shrimp and fish. Toxin profile variation of marine organism samples was influenced greatly by species, sampling time and site.

AB The African elapid snake genus Dendroaspis comprises four species, with D. polylepsis the most dangerous of them. D. viridis is believed to cause stronger neurotoxic symptoms than the potentially least toxic of the genus, D. angusticeps, but seems less toxic compared to either of the D. jamesoni species (D. j. jomesoni(TRAILL 1843) and D. j. kaimosae (Loveridge 1936)). We present three episodes of bites by D. viridis in the same patient, sustained on three different occasions, caused by three different and unrelated snakes. While the first bite remained oligosymptomatic with a slight tightness of the throat and speedy resolution of symptoms without specific therapy, episodes two and three resulted in the patient developing massive local swelling. However, the patient showed only minimal neurologic and systemic symptoms such as tightness of the throat and a tingling sensation of the body. Episode two resolved with fasciotomy after compartment syndrome was diagnosed with a measured intracompartmental pressure of 52 mmHg. In episode three, antivenom was administered with good resolution of symptoms.
   The clinical courses in this patient were remarkable as he displayed mainly local symptoms after three individual bites by a supposedly neurotoxic snake.

AB This study was carried out with a view of understanding the temporal dynamics of microcystin concentrations in both algal seston and water samples and the associated public health risk. All the major MC variants, namely MC-LR, MC-YR, and MC-RR, were detected in both the algal seston and water samples. In the majority of the samples, the most potent variant, MC-LR, constituted the greatest proportion of the total MC concentration suggesting extremely high potential public health risk. The exceptionally high concentrations (mu g L-1) of all the variants, MC-LR (815), MC-YR (466.6) and MC-RR (265.68), were observed in May. Although the extracellular MCs were relatively less concentrated and less frequently detected, concentrations (mu g L-1) of up to 20 of MC-LR, 6.13 of MC-YR, and 1.27 MC-RR were encountered. The strong and significant association between Microcystis abundance and concentration of nitrate (Spearman Rank Order Correlation r = 0.793, p < 0.001) may suggest that nitrate is the key dictating factor in the dynamics of Microcystis, and may have consequently influenced the MC levels in the reservoir.

AB Daboia siamensis monovalent antivenom (DSMAV, Thailand) exhibited comparable immunoreactivity toward the venoms of eastern Russell's vipers from Thailand and Indonesia. It also effectively neutralized the procoagulant and lethal effects of both venoms, showing high potency. The Indonesian heterologous trivalent antivenom SABU (Serum Anti Bisa Ular), however, has very weak immunoreactivity and it failed to neutralize the Russell's viper venoms. DSMAV appears to be the appropriate choice of antivenom to treat Russell's viper envenoming.

AB Sea anemone venoms have long been recognised as a rich source of peptides with interesting pharmacological and structural properties. Our recent transcriptomic studies of the Australian sea anemone Actinia tenebrosa have identified a novel 13-residue peptide, U-AITx-Ate1. U-AITx-Ate1 contains a single disulfide bridge and bears no significant homology to previously reported amino acid sequences of peptides from sea anemones or other species. We have produced U-AITx-Ate1 using solid-phase peptide synthesis, followed by oxidative folding and purification of the folded peptide using reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography. The solution structure of U-AITx-Ate1 was determined based on two-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopic data. Diffusion-ordered NMR spectroscopy revealed that U-AITx-Ate1 was monomeric in solution. Perturbations in the 1D H-1 NMR spectrum of U-AITx-Ate1 in the presence of dodecylphosphocholine micelles together with molecular dynamics simulations indicated an interaction of U-AITx-Ate1 with lipid membranes, although no binding was detected to 100% POPC and 80% POPC: 20% POPG lipid nanodiscs by isothermal titration calorimetry. Functional assays were performed to explore the biological activity profile of U-AITx-Ate1. U-AITx-Ate1 showed no activity in voltage-clamp electrophysiology assays and no change in behaviour and mortality rates in crustacea. Moderate cytotoxic activity was observed against two breast cancer cell lines.

AB Bothrops diporus, previously considered a subspecies of the B. neuwiedi complex, is a medically relevant viperid in Northeastern Argentina. The venom of this species causes local tissue damage characterized by myonecrosis, hemorrhage, blistering, and edema. In the present study, two basic phospholipases A(2) (PLA(2)-I and PLA(2)-II) were isolated from this venom, and their pathological effects upon murine skeletal muscle and myogenic cells in culture were analyzed. Partial amino acid sequencing showed that PLA(2)-I and PLA(2)-II are Asp49 and Lys49 PLA(2)s, respectively. In agreement with this, PLA(2)-I showed PLA(2) activity, whereas PLA(2)-II did not. Functional assays revealed differences in their myotoxicity, cytotoxicity, and anti-adhesion activity, and in the ability to inhibit cell migration, all of which were greater for the Lys49 variant. Native electrophoresis showed that PLA(2)-I was less basic than PLA(2)-II. The two proteins act synergistically to affect the integrity of C2C12 myogenic cells, providing a further example of the concerted action of coexisting snake venom components. PLA(2)-I and PLA(2)-II, together with additional basic PLA(2)s revealed by RP-HPLC, probably play an important role in myonecrosis after envenomation by B. diporus.

AB An outbreak of acute poisoning of horses by Enterolobium contortisiliquum pods is reported in the state of Goias, Brazil. Three horses presented apathy, hyporexia, prostration, jaundice, recumbency and died in 24-48 hours. The main pathological findings were a yellowish liver with an enhanced lobular pattern, multifocal hepatic necrosis mostly in the midzones of lobules and sometimes with a random distribution across the hepatic lobes and swelling of hepatocytes. E. contortisiliquum trees has a wide distribution in South America and cases of poisoning have not been reported in horses.

AB Palicourea marcgravii is the most important toxic plant in Brazil due to its acute toxicity (sudden death), palatability, cumulative effect and broad geographical distribution. The study aimed to evaluate the resistance between cattle of different breeds by experimental intoxication of Palicourea marcgravii. Eighteen males were randomly divided into three groups (Nellore, Curraleiro Pe-Duro and Pantaneiro), six animals in each group. All animals were experimentally intoxicated with P. marcgravii at 0.5 mg/kg of equivalent sodium monofluoracetate acid, receiving one single oral dose. All cattle presented symptoms and the toxic plant caused death in all cattle of the Nellore and Pantaneiro breeds and only three Curraleiro cattle. No changes were observed in the leukogram, fibrinogen, albumin, total protein and bilirubins. Hyperglycemia and increased of aspartate transaminase, creatinine kinase, urea and creatinine were detected in all breeds. Changes in the values of the gamma glutamyl transferase were individualized and did not follow a standard response. Fourteen cattle presented the histopathological findings of renal hydropic degeneration. The lower death rate of Curraleiro cattle indicates a higher resistance than cattle of the Nellore and Pantaneiro breeds.

AB Human dietary exposure to the environmental neurotoxin beta-N-methylamino-L-alanine (BMAA) has been implicated in an increased risk of developing sporadic neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Evidence suggests that humans are exposed to BMAA globally, but very little is known about BMAA metabolism in mammalian systems, let alone in humans. The most plausible, evidence-based mechanisms of BMAA toxicity rely on the metabolic stability of the amino acid and that, following ingestion, it enters the circulatory system unmodified. BMAA crosses from the intestinal lumen into the circulatory system, and the small intestine and liver are the first sites for dietary amino acid metabolism. Both tissues have substantial amino acid metabolic needs, which are largely fulfilled by dietary amino acids. Metabolism of BMAA in these tissues has been largely overlooked, yet is important in gauging the true human exposure risk. Here we investigate the potential for BMAA metabolism by the human liver and small intestine, using in vitro cell systems. Data show that BMAA metabolism via common proteinogenic amino acid metabolic pathways is negligible, and that in the presence of other amino acids cellular uptake of BMAA is substantially reduced. These data suggest that the majority of ingested BMAA remains unmodified following passage through the small intestine and liver. This not only supports oral BMAA exposure as a plausible exposure route to toxic doses of BMAA, but also supports previous notions that protein deficient diets or malnutrition may increase an individual's susceptibility to BMAA absorption and subsequent toxicity.

AB Ochratoxin A (OTA) is a mycotoxin ubiquitous in feeds and foodstuffs. The water-insoluble pentacyclic triterpene bioactive compound, ursolic acid (UA), is widespread in various cuticular waxes of edible fruits, food materials, and medicinal plants. Although studies have reported that oxidative stress was involved in both the nephrotoxicity of OTA and the renoprotective function of UA, the role of stress-responsive Lon protease 1 (Lonp1) in the renoprotection of UA against OTA is still unknown. In this study, cell viability, reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, and several proteins' expressions of human embryonic kidney 293T (HEK293T) cells in response to UA, OTA, and/or Lonp1 inhibitor CDDO-me treatment were detected to reveal the protective mechanism of UA against OTA-induced renal cytotoxicity. Results indicated that a 2 h-treatment of 1 mu M UA could significantly alleviate the ROS production and cell death induced by a 24 h-treatment of 8 mu M OTA in HEK293T cells (P < 0.05). Compared with the control, the protein expressions of Lonp1, Aco2 and Hsp75 were significantly inhibited after 8 mu M OTA treating for 24 h (P < 0.05), which could be notably reversed by the pretreatment and post-treatment of 1 mu M UA (P < 0.05). The protein expressions of Lonp1, Aco2 and Hsp75 were inhibited by the addition of CDDO-me. The three protein expression trends were similar before and after the addition of CDDO-me. In conclusion, OTA could inhibit the expression of Lonp1, suppressing Aco2 and Hsp75 as a result, thereby activating ROS and inducing cell death in HEK293T cells, which could be alleviated by UA pre-treatment.

AB Voltage gated ion channels have become a subject of investigation as possible pharmaceutical targets. Research has linked the activity of ion channels directly to anti-inflammatory pathways, energy homeostasis, cancer proliferation and painful diabetic neuropathy. Sea anemones secrete a diverse array of bioactive compounds including potassium and sodium channel toxins. A putative novel sodium channel agonist (molecular mass of 4619.7 Da) with a predicted sequence: CLCNSDGPSV RGNTLSGILW LAGCPSGWHN CKKHKPTIGW CCK was isolated from Bunodosoma capense using a modified stimulation technique to induce the secretion of the neurotoxin rich mucus confirmed by an Artemia nauplii bio-assay. The peptide purification combined size-exclusion and reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography. A thallium-based ion flux assay confirmed the presence of a sodium channel agonist/inhibitor and purity was determined using a modified tricine SDS-PAGE system. The peptide isolated indicated the presence of multiple disulfide bonds in a tight beta-defensin cystine conformation. An IC50 value of 26 nM was determined for total channel inhibition on MCF-7 cells. The unique putative sodium channel agonist initiating with a cystine bond indicates a divergent evolution to those previously isolated from Bunodosoma species.

AB Botulinum neurotoxin (BoNT) is synthesized as a progenitor toxin complex (PTC) by Clostridium botulinum. This PTC comprises, in addition to the neurotoxin itself, neurotoxin associated proteins (NAPs) which are composed of three hemagglutinins and one non-toxic, non-hemagglutinin protein. After oral ingestion, these NAPs protect the neurotoxin from the low pH and proteases in the gastrointestinal tract and play a role in the entry via the intestinal barrier. Two of the three therapeutically used botulinum neurotoxin serotype A (BoNT/A) products (onabotulinumtoxinA and abobotulinumtoxinA) contain different amounts of NAPs, while incobotulinumtoxinA, lacks these proteins. In addition, human serum albumin (HSA) that is supposed to stabilize BoNT/A is added at different concentrations. Up to now, the function of the NAPs and HSA after parenteral therapeutic application is not completely understood.
   To investigate the influence of NAPs and HSA on potency of BoNT/A, we used the ex vivo mouse phrenic nerve hemidiaphragm assay.
   Increasing doses of HSA resulted dose-dependently in a more pronounced effect of BoNT/A. Though, a plateau was reached with concentrations of 0.8 mg/ml HSA and higher, the accessory addition of NAPs in a relevant amount (4 ng/ml) did not further enhance the effect of BoNT/A.
   In conclusion, in our ex vivo assay an adequate concentration of HSA prevented BoNT/A from loss of effect and supplementary NAPs did not alter this effect. A confirmation of these data in an in vivo assay is still lacking. However, it might be supposed that even in clinically applied BoNT/A products an increase of HSA accompanied by the avoidance of NAPs could potentially reduce the injected dose and, thus, the risk of unwanted side effects, the treatment costs as well as the risk of a secondary therapy failure due to BoNT/A neutralizing antibodies.

AB Five amorphous heavy metal oxide borate glasses have been fabricated by melt quenching method. The density of the fabricated samples changes from 5.411-7.075 (g/cm(3)) whereas molar volume decreases from 33.806-30.198 (cm(3)mol(-1)) as lead concentration increases from 40 to 60 mol%. The FTIR spectra reveals the various structural properties of the samples. The indirect and direct band gap energies have been obtained from the UV spectra. Both values of E-g decrease as the PbO content increases. These indirect band gap energy values are further used for the calculation of the other optical parameters. The gamma shielding features of the prepared samples were evaluated and the results revealed that the mass attenuation coefficient increased with increasing the content of PbO and the sample coded as Pb60B10 has the highest protection efficiency. The effective atomic number values for the samples are high between 0.015 and 0.2 MeV and in order of 78.18-60.11 for Pb40B30.

AB Sm3+/Eu3+ single doped and co-doped zinc-germanate-tellurite glasses were prepared by the glass melting method. Raman and optical spectroscopic properties of Sm3+, Eu3+ and Sm3+/Eu3+ doped TeO2-GeO2-ZnO glasses have been characterized through optical absorption and pulsed/steady fluorescence. Excitation and emission spectra measurements indicated that the energy transfer process Sm -> Eu is active in the samples. The concentration of europium ions was varied to provide red emission for possible control over the chromaticity tuning in the red-orange region. Upon 344 non excitation, the color of the global emission can be adjusted from orange of 2038 K to reddish-orange of 1683 K by increasing the Eu3+ content from 1 up to 2% mol, and co-doped with 0.5% mol Sm3+. Reddish-orange color purity very close to 100% is attained when the phosphors are excited at 406 nm. The time shortening of Sm3+ emission decay in the presence of Eu3+ was attributed to a Sm3+ -> Eu3+ non-radiative energy transfer process. From fitting the Sm3+ emission decay profile with the Inokuti-Hirayama model, it was inferred that the energy transfer process could be dominated by an electric dipole-dipole interaction.

AB In the present work, the radiation shielding proeprties of lithium borophosphtellurite glass system with the composition of (100-x) [0.5Li(2)O-0.1B(2)O(3)-0.4P(2)O(5)]-xTeO(2) (x = 0, 10, 20, 30 and 40 mol%) were reported. The mass attenuation coefficient (mu/rho) of the selected glass system (LiBPTe0, LiBPTe10, LiBPTe20, LiBPTe30 and LiBPTe40) was calculated at 356 keV, 662 keV, 1173 keV and 1330 keV photon energies by using Geant4 and FLUKA codes and the results were compared to the values obtained theoretically using WinXcom software. The correlation theory has been used to calculate the correlation coefficients (R-2) between the results from WinXcom and the both simulations codes (Geant4 and FLUKA) for each sample. Moreover, some other radiation shielding parameters such as effective atomic number, photon transmission, mean free path and half value layer were calculated. The gamma photon transmission results showed that the transmission values of the 356 keV photons are lower than those of energies 662, 1173 and 1330 keV. At 356 keV, the transmission value for LiBPTe0 (at 6 cm thickness) is found to be 0.245 while at the same energy and thickness the transmission value is 0.088 for LiBPTe40. Out of all the glasses considered in present work, LiBPTe40 possesses the highest values of effective atomic number (Z(eff)). The Z(eff) values for the present glasses are 8.02, 9.55, 11.16, 12.85 and 14.64 for LiBPTe0, LiBPTe10, LiBPTe20, LiBPTe30 and LiBPTe40 respectively at 356 keV. The mass attenuation coefficient and effetive atomic number results showed that utilization 40% mol of TeO2 significantly improves the gamma ray shielding properties of the selected glass system. The shielding effectiveness of the selected samples was compared with other reference materials namely two radiation shielding glasses and four concretes used in different shielding purposes in terms of the mean free path (MFP) at 356 keV. The results revealed that the MFP of RS-253-G18 is lower than LiBPTeOsample. Moreover, the MFP of ordinary concrete is higher than the MFP of all glasses under examination, thus the investigated tellurite glasses have better attenuation features than the ordinary concrete.

AB Alkali alumina-borate glass-ceramics doped with different concentration of Cr3+ ions was prepared by conventional melt-quenching technique. Luminescent glass-ceramics was derived by volume crystallization of the precursor glass via two-stage heat treatment. The phase transition temperatures, structure, spectral and luminescent properties of the glass-ceramics were determined by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), X-ray diffraction (XRD), optical absorption, photo- and cathodoluminescent spectroscopy. The XRD studies revealed the LiAl7B4O17: Cr3+ nanocrystals nucleation (mean size of 20-23 nm) during the heat treatment. The photoluminescence spectra consisted of three intense bands in the 685-715 nm region. The maximum quantum yield value under 532 nm excitation was 30%. The difference between photoluminescence (PL) and cathodoluminescence (CL) decay kinetics is presented and possible nature of this phenomenon is discussed.

AB In this study we have investigated the influence of MnO content on electrical characteristics (viz., dielectric properties including impedance spectra over wide ranges of continuous frequencies and temperatures, a.c and d.c. conductivities) of lead zirconium silicate glass ceramic with a view to assess its insulating character. Such assessment is crucial for using the material in different electronic devices, for example, as insulating sheets in the display panels. The variations of epsilon, tan delta (measured at different temperatures and frequencies) observed with the concentration of MnO are analysed in terms of structural transformations taking place in the glass ceramics. Although, the dielectric constant and loss tangent with temperature and frequency have not exhibited any distinct dipolar relaxation effects, the electric moduli (evaluated using real and imaginary parts of dielectric constant) have exhibits such effects clearly. Moreover, the variation of relaxation time (evaluated from electric moduli spectra) indicated multiple relaxation times for dipoles. Relaxation effects were ascribed to the complexes of octahedral Mn2+ ions. The conductivity (both ac and dc) with concentration of MnO exhibited the minima at 0.6 mol% of MnO. This effect is attributed to predominant presence of Mn ions in tetrahedral positions that were assumed to alternate with SiO4 units in the glass network. In the studied samples, both ionic and polaronic components are predicted to contribute to the conductivity. The polaronic component (arises due to exchange of polarons between Mn2+ <-> Mn3+ ions) seemed to be gradually dominating over the ionic component with progressive insertion of MnO content up to 0.6 mol% in the bulk glass ceramic sample. The near temperature invariant part of sigma(ac) behaviour (in the low temperature range) is analysed using both quantum mechanical tunnelling (QMT) model and the concentration of defect energy states near the Fermi level (N(E-F), evaluated in this range of temperatures, was found to be the minimal for the sample M-6. Analysis of dc conductivity results suggested the small polaron hoping (SPH) model holds good in the high temperature region; however, for the low temperature part of dc conductivity variable range hopping (VRH) model seems to be more appropriate. Finally, with the increase of MnO concentration up to 0.6 mol% in the titled glass ceramics, the conductivity decreases and leads to increase in the insulating strength of the material. This unique functionality may also make the investigated glass ceramic material perspective for medical applications in addition to their usage as insulating sheets in the display panels.

AB Femtosecond laser written waveguides have been previously proposed as potential compact photonic devices in multimedia glass covers. The structural modification induced by laser irradiation may however affect the mechanical strength of this protective glass layer. Therefore, the impact of such femtosecond laser radiation on the mechanical strength of toughened multimedia to determine if inclusion of photonics structures into this glass is suitable, is investigated in this work. Inscriptions written using a 250 fs laser center at 515 mu at different writing speeds (1-300 mm/s), pulse energy (0.495 to 1.32 mu J), density (number) of inscriptions (up to 50) and depth of the inscriptions (20 to 200 pm) from the surface, were submitted to Weibull analysis and the two parameters Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) test. No degradation between a set of pristine and fs inscribed samples were observed showing that femtosecond laser inscription inside this type of glass does not alter its mechanical properties significantly.

AB Here we investigated photo-darkening (PD) effect and its influence on laser performance in Yb3+-doped microstructure optical fiber made through the laser sintering technique (LST). Through measuring the temporal evolution of PD excess loss at 633 nm and fiber lasing characteristics, it was found that the home-made fiber has relatively low PD and high slope efficiency. The obtained PD equilibrium loss a(eq) at 633 nm is 1.07 dB/m. After 30 h 976 nm laser irradiation, the fiber presents a quite small power degradation of 0.45 %. Moreover, the laser slope efficiency shows a small decline of 0.26 %, from 81.03 % to 80.77 %. The investigation of optical performance demonstrates that Yb3+-doped fiber fabricated by LST has uniform elements distribution, reasonable absorption, low background loss and a relatively low PD behavior, making it a potential application for effective high-power fiber lasers.

AB In prior work from this lab it was reported that the glass transition temperature (T-g)-fragility (m) or apparent activation (E-g) energy correlation for a series of ambers was similar to the behavior of aromatic synthetic polymers. In the present work we have broadened the range of ambers studied to include three Texas ambers and three Canadian ambers that have only recently been discovered and/or chemically classified. Upon comparison with the prior data, we find that the results for the Texas ambers fall within the same correlation of fragility and activation energy with glass transition temperature as was found previously. On the other hand, the Canadian ambers exhibit a very different behavior as reflected in very high fragility and activation energy at the Tg. We propose that, the observation is related to the unique crosslinking structure or other subtle chemistry differences in the polymer structure of the studied Canadian ambers.

AB In this study, the corrosion resistance of alumino-silicate glass containing Ca, Y and B is assessed against CF4/O-2/Ar plasma, with the results compared to those of poly-crystalline and single-crystalline alumina. All of the alumino-silicate glasses containing Ca, Y and B were more resistant than sintered alumina to a plasma-etching gas. Glass samples with boron oxide were less corroded by plasma than those without B2O3, and their surfaces were contaminated by the CFx generated by the plasma reaction.
   CaO-Y2O3-Al2O3-SiO2 (CYAS) showed a lower etch rate than sapphire and retained a smooth surface microstructure, unlike sintered alumina. The plasma resistance improved with an increase in the calcium oxide content. The improved plasma resistance of CYAS glass is thought to be due to the high sublimation temperature of the calcium fluoride and the strong atomic binding energy of the calcium ions in the glass.

TI Investigation of the short range order structures in sodium

AB The very first detailed structural examination of glasses in the sodium thioborosilicate (NTBS) mixed glass former (MGF) system is reported. As in our previous studies of MGF systems, we have fixed the ratio of the modifier, Na2S, to the total glass former (GF), BS3/2 + SiS2, and varied the ratio of the two base GFs, the pure sodium thiosilicate (NTS) and sodium thioborate (NTB) end member binary glass systems. We have found that the 0.6Na(2)S + 0.4[xBS(3/2) + (1-x)SiS2] series with its relatively high Na2S content is continuously glass forming for all x, 0 <= x <= 1, in large similar to 2 mm thick samples with only modest quenching was observed. Other higher and lower Na2S content glass series were investigated, but were found to be very poor glass formers and for this reason not further studied. Further, and advantageously, but not reported on here, this high Na2S content is also associated with glasses of the highest Na+ ion conductivities in either NTS or NTB binary glasses. Infrared, Raman, and B-11 and Si-29 magic angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance (MAS-NMR) spectroscopies were used to examine the short-range order (SRO) structures present in these glasses as a function of x. As expected from this high modifier content, the predominate finding is that these glasses are comprised mostly of depolymerized SRO units that possess one or at most two bridging sulfurs (BSs). Indeed, the main SRO structures observed in these glasses are the Si-0, B-0, and Si-1 SRO units which contain no BSs and one BS, respectively. The Si-1 and B-0 SRO units are those expected from the composition of the binary series of glasses studied here, namely 3Na/Si for x = 0 and 3 Na/B for x = 1, respectively. However, the Raman spectra shows clear evidence of the disproportionate sharing of the Na+ towards the Si SRO units. This creates significant fractions of Si-0 units for intermediate compositions. Likewise, a very close inspection and deconvolution of the NMR spectra and careful attention to charge balance shows that, as seen in other MGF systems, other SRO units with more BS structures, such as B-1, B-2, and B-4 SRO units are formed from the transfer of the Na2S from the NTB subsystem to the NTS subsystem. The (ESi2)-Si-1 unit appears to be a common SRO unit in NTS (and other alkali) glasses and consists of two Si possessing two non-bridging sulfurs (NBSs) but linked together by two BSs in an edge-sharing motif. Due to the presence of the (ESi2)-Si-1 units (50 mol% Na2S) in a compositional series that is nominally 60 mol% Na2S, we find that the lack of sufficient Si SRO units to account for the extra Na2S necessarily produces a small amount of free, unreacted Na2S, < 10 mol% of the total sodium sulfide in the system. Interestingly, the concentration of this "free" Na2S appears to increase with increasing NTB, x, content. Finally, as in nearly all non-oxide chalcogenide glasses, we do find a small amount of contaminant oxygen, always less than 5 mol%, as a fraction of the total O + S, O/(O + S), in all of the glasses that increases in proportion to the amount of BS3/2 in the glass.
   This result is consistent with our experience that the starting material BS3/2 always contains more impurity O than the SiS2 starting material.

AB This study aims to develop a geopolymer binder, which requires a control of the reactive mixture setting time, viscosity and pH value. A previous study underlines the possibility of controlling the setting time, viscosity and pH value of geopolymer binders by the addition of phosphate-or boron-based compounds. To understand the structural evolutions responsible for these operating property changes, magic angle spinning (MAS) nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) analysis were performed on the different binders. A batch of ten specific samples was studied by B-11 or P-31 (depending on the additive nature), Al-27 and Si-29 MAS NMR. The NMR spectral decomposition results were correlated with the operating properties of the different binders. The setting time increase was associated with the formation of a secondary phase based on boron or phosphorous. The pH variation is connected with both the modified Si/Al ratio and the asymmetric B-III species associated with one non-bridging oxygen (NBO) atom. Thus, determination of the various NMR environments is a useful tool to predict the setting time and pH value evolutions.

AB This work aimed to prepare novel nano-bioactive glass compositions, belonging to the SiO2-CaO system, for local ciprofloxacin administration. As a new approach, drug loading and its release kinetics of glass nanoparticles were optimized by increasing the modifier content at the expense of glass former. Four different Glass samples, of 3.2, 13.8, 24.2, and 34.5 mol% CaO content, were prepared (coded as CS1, CS2, CS3 and CS4, respectively). They were characterized by TEM, DSC, TGA and FTIR. The glass samples exhibited specific surface areas of 299.3, 140.5, 81.59, and 17.58 (m(2).g(-1)), respectively. A strong correlation was established between the modifier contents of the glass samples and drug loading or release doses. Modeling the drug release profiles of all glass samples confirmed that drug was released via a controlled diffusion mean. All glass samples induced hydroxyapatite layer onto their surfaces after immersion in simulated body fluid.

AB The work is dedicated to the investigation of optical, structural, magnetic and magneto-optical properties of an aluminophosphate glass doped with Dy3+ ions, for specific applications as Faraday rotators in the visible spectral domain. The vitreous material belongs to the 16Li(2)O-8Al(2)O(3)-6BaO center dot 60P(2)O(5)-10Dy(2)O(3) system. Optical homogeneity measured by a polariscopic method, as well as by polarimetry and interferometry revealed an optical quality glass. Time dependent electrical conductance measurements have shown a high chemical strength of the glass. Optical absorption of the doped glass in the visible domain evidenced the specific absorption lines of dysprosium ions, whereas structural investigations made by FTIR and Raman spectroscopy put in evidence the vitreous network forming role of phosphorous pentoxide. Magnetic and magneto-optical measurements demonstrated paramagnetic features of the doped glass, as well as a Verdet constant of about -0.05 min/Oe/cm at 600 nm wavelength.

AB Recently we developed a superior V2O5-TeO2 (VT) glass anode for Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) by the disorder/order engineering. In this work, we investigate the effect of Al2O3 doping on the physical, thermal and electrochemical properties of the V2O5-TeO2 glass anode. To do so, we prepared the glass samples with the composition of xAl(2)O(3)-(100-x) (TeO2-V2O5) (x = 3, 5, 8, and 10 mol%) (AVT). The results show that there exists a critical Al2O3 content, i.e., 5 mol% Al2O3, which gave LiBs the highest capacity of 202 mA h g(-1) after 1000 cycles of discharging/charging under the current density of 1 A g(-1) and the lowest charge-transfer resistance before cycling. The disorder-order transition was found to take place in the AVT glass anodes, accompanied by formation of tellurium nanocrystals after 1000 cycles at 1 A g(-1). Both the Te nanocrystals and the glass matrix synergistically enhanced the capacity and the cycling stability of the AVT glass anode. These findings are useful for designing and developing new types of glass anodes with high capacity and long cycling life for LiBs.

AB In the present work, the Pr9Fe65W4B22 magnets in the form of melt-spun ribbons of various thicknesses and suction-cast 1 mm diameter rods were investigated. The crystallization behavior was studied using DSC and XRD. The studies have shown that the as-cast ribbons had amorphous or partially crystalline structure depending on the thickness of the sample. On the other hand XRD pattern of the as-cast 1 mm diameter rod revealed their crystalline structure. The specimens were subjected to annealing at temperatures ranging from 923 K to 1003 K for 5 min. Heat treatment resulted in an evolution of the phase mixture that caused changes in magnetic properties of the samples. In this paper, the comparison of the phase mixture, microstructure and magnetic properties of the annealed ribbon and rod samples is presented.

AB This study describes investigations of continuous casting for the bulk metallic glass-forming alloys Pd43Ni10Cu27P20 and Pt57.3Cu14.6Ni5.3P22.8, respectively. Continuous casting of the Pd-based alloy readily produced fully amorphous rods of 10 mm diameter and > 500 mm length. In contrast, the Pt-based alloy always underwent crystallization during the casting process, even at smaller rod diameters down to 2 mm. In search of the reason for this difference, we simulated the process using ProCAST. Via adapting the heat transfer coefficients for all the relevant interfaces of the continuous casting setup we obtained good agreement between the experimental temperature data and the simulations. The calculations revealed that the maximum cooling rates achievable with this industrial setup ranged from 15 K/s to 17 K/s. This is well above the critical cooling rate for glass formation of the Pd-based alloy, but below that of the Pt-based alloy, as inferred from literature data and corroborated by fast differential scanning calorimetry. These findings illustrate how detailed casting simulations can predict the feasibility of semi-industrial bulk metallic glass production techniques.

AB An organic solvent-saving method of preparing silica aerogel is reported. The silica aerogel was made from water glass (WG) and used as the solvent. Na+ was removed through ion exchange; prior to this ion exchange, concentrated hydrochloric acid (HCl) was added to the WG solution. The sol pH was adjusted to similar to 1 to suppress the condensation to the maximum extent. Ethanol was added to the sol after ion exchange. Surface modification was conducted with the assistance of hexamethyldisiloxane, which was catalyzed by HCl. The entire process can be finished in 6 h. The overall consumption of organic solvent is much lower than that in the previous preparation route. Characterization results indicate that the resulted silica aerogel has a uniform mesoporous structure and low thermal conductivity (0.0237-0.0245 W/m.K at 1 atm).

AB This paper reports the effect of Mn substitution in (Fe1-xMnx)(75)P15C10(0 <= x <= 0.3) amorphous alloys, which is synthesized by rapidly cooled melt spun technique. The magnetic properties of the fabricated ribbons have shown significant changes upon Mn substitution. M-H measurement at room temperature has shown a gradual transition from soft-to-hard magnetic phase with the increase of Mn concentration. The magnetoresistance is found to increase with Mn concentration at room temperature. The ribbons exhibit high effective ac permeability with low magnetic losses in the high frequency regime. The observed magnetic properties suggest that the antiferromagnetic interactions introduced by Mn atoms cause deviations from a pure ferromagnetic structure at low Mn concentrations.

AB There are still some uncertainties in the origin of photo-thermo-induced refractive index change in PTR glass. On one side, according to Nikonorov N.V. it is assumed to be due to difference of refractive indexes of sodium fluoride nanocrystals (n similar to 1.32) and glass (n similar to 1.49). Later Glebov L.B. et al. suggested another mechanism. They assumed that the transformation of Na and F distributed in PTR glass matrix into crystalline NaF (chemical changes) are not the main causes of photo-thermo-induced refractive index change and accounted it for high residual stresses around the NaF crystals. So present experimental research is focused on revealing of the refractive index change origin in fluoride PTR glass. It is shown experimentally that residual stresses have no measurable effect on the refractive index change in PTR glass, that is in agreement with the estimations made using the Maxwell-Garnet theory.

AB The impact of the heat losses, average melting temperature and kinetics of sand dissolution and bubble removal on the character of the melt flow and melting performance was investigated by the mathematical modelling of a glass melting channel. Quantity space utilization was used to evaluate the melt flow competence with respect to the melting process. The relations of the energetic model were applied to elucidate the results of the modelling and to predict the optimum melt flow conditions. The increase of heat losses influenced favourably the character of the longitudinal melt circulations, increased the space utilization and, consequently, the melting performance. The specific heat losses remained almost the same. No obvious tendency to the development of an efficient helical melt flow, supported by an increase of heat losses, was observed. The increasing average melting temperature and increasing rate of both melting phenomena slightly decreased the space utilization in the currently applied interval of the melting conditions.

AB The thermodynamic driving force is used to obtain the initial mixing ratio of binary eutectics to design Cu-based bulk metallic glasses. By adjusting approximately 5% proportionality coefficients from the primary mixing ratios of eutectic units, we directly locate amorphous compositions with critical casting diameter of 5 mm (Cu47.5Zr45.1Al7.4) and 7 mm (Cu47.3Zr45.8Al6.4Sn0.5) in Cu-Zr-Al and Cu-Zr-Al-Sn systems, respectively. Using the Cu-Zr-Al alloys as an example, the improvement of glass-forming ability (GFA) is systematically analyzed based on thermodynamics and atomic-scale structure. A relatively lower driving force for crystallization and larger populations of Cu-centered full icosahedra with the large tendency to form MROs jointly contribute to the stability of liquid. With regard to topology, the closer local atomic size ratio compared with the ideal value for icosahedral packing around the Cu atom may be the dominant factor for the higher number of Cu-centered full icosahedra and enhanced GFA.

AB Technetium-99 (Tc-99) is a major radionuclide of concern in the Hanford low-activity waste (LAW), which will be vitrified into borosilicate glass at the Waste Treatment and Immobilization Plant (WTP). Sulfate in LAW has been known to be a critical factor affecting the volatile loss of Tc-99. We investigated rhenium (a nonradioactive surrogate for Tc-99) incorporation by crucible melting tests of two representative simulated LAW glass feeds, each prepared with varied sulfur concentrations in glass. The slurry feeds were dried and heated to 400-1100 degrees C. Soluble and insoluble phases of heated feeds were analyzed to profile the partitioning of various components during the melting process. The mechanism of how sulfate affects rhenium incorporation during feed-to-glass conversion reactions, and so final retention of rhenium in glass, is proposed based on the two hypotheses that segregated sulfate-rich phase forms during feed conversion reactions and Re preferentially partitions to this sulfate-rich phase.

AB Barium borophosphate glasses doped with dysprosium oxide had been fabricated by conventional melt quenching technique using the chemical composition of: (25BaO: 5B(2)O(3): 70-xP(2)O(5): xDy(2)O(3))), where (x = 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8 and 1.0, mol%) (BaBPDy). The physical, optical and luminescence properties are studied for possibility of using as a white luminescence materials for solid-state light emitting devices. Judd-Ofelt (JO) theory is applied to study the radiative properties of the luminescence level of Dy3+ ions. The effect of the concentration quenching due to increase in Dy3+ ions is discussed in details. The lifetime of all BaBPDy concentration glass is bi-exponential in nature, which is discussed in the present work. This non-exponential nature of the decay curve was fitted by using the well-known Inokuti-Hirayama (IH) model S = 6, indicating that the energy transfer process is dipole-dipole type. The chromaticity co-ordinate(x, y) is evaluated from the luminescence spectra and its possibility for using as a white light application has been analyzed.

AB In the present investigation, the novel glass series xLa(2)O(3)-(10-x)Y2O3-15SrO-15CaO-10B(2)O(3)-10Al(2)O(3)-40SiO(2) (x = 2, 4, 6, 8) has been synthesized by melt quenching technique. The characteristic glass temperatures and the inflection point temperature (T-f) for the glasses have been determined by DTA and differential DTA (DDTA), respectively. The activation energy is calculated using Kissinger, Moynihan and Augis and Benett models. Various kinetic parameters such as fluctuation free volume (f(g)), Hruby parameter (H-r), bulk thermal expansion coefficient (alpha(f)) and k parameters are calculated for studying glass stability with varying La2O3/Y2O3 ratio. The amorphous nature and crystalline phase formation has been studied by X-ray diffraction. Furthermore, the coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) for all the glasses has been calculated. The interaction studies of the diffusion couples of glasses with pre-oxidized Crofer 22APU and 8YSZ have been carried out at 850 degrees C. 2 LaY glass is very stable and promising potential sealant for the SOFCs.

AB Spectroscopic, thermal and structural properties of rare earth (RE) doped zinc borotellurite glasses and nano-glass-ceramics are characterized using UV-Vis-NIR spectroscopy, photoluminescence (PL), decay time measurements, differential thermal analysis (DTA), X-ray diffraction (XRD), field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) and Raman spectroscopy. It is found that there is an increase in thermal stability factor with the increase of dysprosium ion (Dy3+) concentration. XRD results confirm the amorphous character of glasses and the presence of alpha-TeO2 and gamma-TeO2 phases in nano-glass-ceramics. Raman spectroscopy results show the formation of non-bridging oxygens (NBO's) by the addition of Dy2O3 at the expense of Te-O-Te linkages of TeO4 units and there is formation of the crystalline phases in the prepared glasses on heat treatment. A considerable change in the values of Judd-Ofelt parameters of glasses is observed after the heat treatment. The CIE Coordinates of TBZDy(0.5)GC (0.32, 0.34) are closer to that for commercial pc-LED (0.32, 0.33). There is a decrease in the lifetime is observed with the increase in concentration of Dy3+ due to concentration quenching. The high stimulated emission cross-section (sigma(emi)), lifetime and quantum efficiency (eta) values for prepared glasses and nano-glass-ceramics imply their suitability for the fabrication of white light laser.

AB When glasses resist permanent deformations, for applications such as a windshield or the cover of a touch-screen device, it is important to understand how they respond to inelastic energy dissipation processes. Many glasses exhibit the so-called Indentation Size Effect (ISE), where the indentation hardness is dependent on the maximum force exerted on the probe. In this study, we perform microindentation on silica and soda lime silicate glasses over a wide range of maximum forces and extract the Vickers hardness by the Oliver and Pharr method. The inelastic volume responsible for dissipating the inelastic energy is decomposed into densification and plastic flow, using surface topography and annealing. We show that the ISE is intimately linked to these mechanisms. Finally, we hypothesize the cause of the ISE is an increase in plasticity in a zone of material under the indenter probe experiencing reduced viscosity due to high strain rates and shear thinning.

AB The effect of structural water on density, elastic constants and microhardness of water-bearing soda-lime-silica glasses of up to 21.5 mol% total water is studied. It is found that the Poisson ratio and the water content are positively correlated, while density and the elastic moduli decrease with increasing water content. Vickers hardness decreases by approximately 27% from the dry to the most hydrous glass. For water fractions < 3 mol%, the dependencies are non-linear reflecting the non-linear change in the concentrations of OH and H2O molecules dissolved, whereas for water fractions >3 mol% linear dependencies are found. To distinguish the effect of structural water and environmental water, indentations were performed in toluene, nitrogen gas and air. Time dependent softening was evident for testing dry glasses in humid atmospheres as well as for tests of hydrous glasses in dry atmospheres. This indicates that the response times of dissolved water species are effectively equal in both scenarios.

AB This study elucidates the role of Al2O3 in the lithium borovanadate (LBV) system, Li2O-B2O3-V2O5, in improving the glass-forming region of LBV glass. This increased glass-forming tendency is likely due to formation of [AlO4](-) units. B-11, Al-27, and V-51 nuclear magnetic resonance measurements suggest an importance of V-O-Al linkages and distribution of Li for charge compensation of [AlO4](-) and [BO4](-) units. Intense V-51 NMR signals and resolved hyperfine coupling patterns in the electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectra indicate that the majority of vanadium is pentavalent (V5+) and minor amounts of paramagnetic vanadium (V4+) are present. The EPR interaction parameters suggest that the vanadyl-like environments can be described as tetragonally compressed distorted octahedra. Based on V-2p(3/2) X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, the V4+ concentration is estimated at < 3%. These vanadate glasses are attractive for energy storage applications, as they have higher specific capacities than commercial lithium-ion battery cathodes.

AB Spectroscopic properties of the Tm-doped borate glass with LiKB4O2 (0.5Li(2)O-0.5K(2)O-2B(2)O(3)) basic composition are investigated and analysed using optical absorption and photoluminescence (excitation, emission, decay kinetics) experimental techniques as well as Judd-Ofelt analysis. Optical absorption spectra exhibit absorption bands related with transitions of Tm3+ ions. The theoretical and experimental oscillator strengths for observed absorption transitions as well as Judd-Ofelt intensity parameters (Omega(2), Omega(4), Omega(6)) have been calculated. Photoluminescence spectra reveal a lot of emission bands in the visible and infrared spectral ranges related with 4f - 4f transitions of Tm3+ ions. Luminescence decay kinetics of several excited states was detailed investigated and analysed. Radiative properties such as radiative transition probabilities (A(rad)), luminescence branching ratios (beta), radiative lifetimes (tau(rad)), quantum efficiency (eta), and stimulated emission cross-section (sigma(em)) have been estimated. The obtained results show that the investigated LiKB4O7:Tm glass belongs to perspective luminescent and laser materials in the visible and infrared spectral ranges.

AB In this report, a topological constraint model is developed to predict the glass transition temperature (T-g) and liquid fragility (m) of xBi(2)O(3)center dot(1-x)NaPO3 glass-forming systems by considering the hierarchy of temperature dependent constraints, including contributions from the modifying cations (Bi3+ and Na+). The model is shown to give an accurate prediction of the T-g and m as a function of composition (x). The increase of T-g with x is mainly caused by the formation of the Bi-O linear constraints and also contributions from O-Bi-O angular constraints, which increase the connectivity of the network. The model also accurately predicts the trend of m with composition, which shows a minimum at around x = 5 mol% due to the competition between the contributions from the Na-O linear constraints and the O-Bi-O angular constraints.

AB Dilatometric and shear, modulus measurements on four Zr-based glasses both below and above the glass transition temperature upon linear heating and isothermal conditions are performed. It is found that density changes occurring upon structural relaxation and crystallization are closely related to the relaxation of the shear modulus. The obtained results are discussed in terms of the Interstitialcy theory.

AB Niobium alkali germanate glasses doped with Er3+ up to 4.0 mol% were synthesized by the melt-quenching technique. Glass-ceramics were obtained by controlled heat treatment of the pristine glass. Thermal and optical properties were investigated and are shown to depend on the erbium content. The main radiative parameters were obtained based on the Judd-Ofelt theory. The change of radiation energy processes and modification of the environment of the earth-rare ion occurs in samples with high erbium concentrations. In general, strong enhancement of upconversion emission occurs due to the efficient process of excited-state absorption for the high erbium content samples. Visible tunable phosphors emitting either red-to-green light depends on the erbium content and heat treatment. In addition, these glasses and glass-ceramics samples have high thermal stability and wide transmission window. For these reasons, Er3+-doped niobium germanate glasses and glass-ceramics may be suitable for photonic device applications, especially as visible laser.

AB In modern technologies, the researchers are keen on top-down approaches to tailor the materials from bulk into their nanometer forms. For the amorphous alumina, this is the other way around. The amorphous alumina was receiving attention in the forms of thin films or nanoparticles many years ago, yet any attempts to increase the dimensions destabilized its amorphous structure and caused crystallization at even relatively modest temperatures. This issue has been addressed by smart engineering of its lattice strain, which allows the formation of a high-temperature stable bulk alumina. In this review, we present the recently developed synthetic methods and provide insights in sustaining the amorphous structure of widely used alumina. We highlight its adoptable short-range structure and morphology, emphasize the corresponding tuning of the mechanical and electronic properties, and illuminate the advanced applications in wear and scratch resistant coatings, corrosion protection, insulator layers, capacitor, luminescent material, and catalysis.

AB The optical properties of 20Al(PO3)(3)-80LiF (APLF80) glass co-doped with praseodymium (Pr3+) and cerium (Ce3+) ions are explored. By co-doping the host APLF80 glass matrix with praseodymium (Pr3+) and cerium (Ce3+) ions (APLF80 + PrCe), improvement in the luminescence decay time of the 5d -> 4f allowed electric dipole transition of singly-doped APLF80 + Pr under optical excitation is achieved. Both radiative and non radiative energy transfers from Pr3+ to Ce3+ are observed. Non-radiative energy transfer leads to Pr3+ luminescence quenching resulting to faster decay times of Pr3+, especially at high Ce3+-doping concentrations. Our results present exciting prospects for APLF80 as a response time improved scintillator.

AB Amorphous conductors with high ionic conductivity are a promising candidate as electrolytes in all-solid state batteries. In this work, we prepared amorphous Ag3PS4 conductor via a chemo-mechanical milling process, and then characterized its structure and electrochemical properties. The results show that Ag+ conductivity of the amorphous Ag3PS4 was remarkably enhanced by three orders of magnitude compared to its crystalline counterpart. Furthermore, the amorphous sample exhibits lower activation energy (E-a) for ionic conductivity as a function of temperature. Structural characterizations indicate that the tetrahedral [PS4] units were retained in amorphous Ag3PS4, but the Ag+ ions became more liberated than those in the crystalline state, leading to the enhanced migration of Ag+ ions, thereby, the ionic conductivity in amorphous Ag3PS4 is drastically increased. This work provides insight into the crucial role of the disorder in raising the ionic conductivity of amorphized chalcogenide materials containing mobile ions.

AB In this work, we report the thickness effects on microstructure, mechanical and soft magnetic properties of Fe75Zr25 thin film metallic glasses (TFMGs) prepared by DC magnetron sputtering. The Fe75Zr25 TFMGs exhibit a nano-granular structure and the particle size is growing with the increase of thickness. The hardness (H) and the elastic modulus (E) evaluated by nanoindentation, both show a decreasing trend with the increase of film thickness. The smooth P-h curves reflect a homogenous deformation mode, which is attributed to the activation of shear transformation zones (STZs) in the nanoscale granular thin films that could reasonably restrain the formation of shear bands. Furthermore, a positive strain rate dependence was observed for all films with highest strain rate sensitivity SRS (m) value of 0.037 for thicker film, more likely due to the free volumes accumulation during deformation. In addition, Fe75Zr25 TFMGs show anomalous strong ferromagnetism at low and high temperatures (10 K and 300 K). It is found that in a critical thickness of 270 nm, the Fe75Zr25 TFMGs manifest the desired combination of soft magnetism and mechanics. The underlying mechanism of variation in mechanical and soft magnetic properties could be rationalized in light of the interplay of nanoscale granular size and structural evolution with increase of film thickness.

AB Medium-range order structure is the one of the important local structural units in the field of bulk metallic glasses. The rapid solidification of Cu50Zr40Al10 ternary alloy is investigated by molecular dynamics simulation. Simultaneously, the connections between the full icosahedral and defective icosahedral clusters in medium range order structures of Cu50Zr40Al10 alloy are characterized systematically by the quantitative method and visualization analysis. The results reveal that the icosahedral clusters as the main structures with high structural stability are bonded with each other by interpenetrating connection, and form the triangle, double triangle, triple triangle, tetrahedron and chain connected icosahedral medium-range order clusters. Moreover, the icosahedral and defective icosahedral clusters prefer to link with each other and form the bigger medium-range order clusters with different configurations in this system. These structures keep the high structural stability of icosahedral medium-range order section and the structural variability of chain-like medium-range order structures.

TI Structure and photoelastic constant of binary ns(2)-type metal cation

SO JOURNAL OF NON-CRYSTALLINE SOLIDS

DT Article
ID SI-29 MAS NMR; DIFFRACTION
AB The photoelastic constant of nominal molar compositions RO(R'O-2(3))-SiO2(R = Pb, R' = Sb, Bi) decreases with increasing RO and R'O-2(3), which is in agreement with calculations based on the quantitative structural information of silicate tetrahedra determined by Si-29 MAS-NMR. Compositional dependence of the photoelastic property is attributed to the electronic polarizabilities of the constituent ions. To understand the relationship between the structure and photoelastic response, the reported electronic polarizability is modified to match the value that includes the observed density and refractive index based on Lorentz-Lorenz eq. A composition of photoelastic glass with zero photoelastic constant is identified by an empirical equation that provides the ratio of the metal-oxygen bond length to the coordination number. Our finding is that the compositional response in the photoelastic constant is due to the variation in the electronic polarizability, despite the different ns(2)-type metal cations incorporated in the silicate glass.

AB Amorphous PbO - WO3 - BaO - Na2O - B2O3 glass system have fabricated using traditional melt quenching method. The XRD and FTIR spectra confirm the amorphous nature and the various structural properties of the glasses respectively. The various optical properties have been measured in the spectral range 400-4000 cm(-1). Also, to understand the shielding ability of the fabricated glasses, we used the Geant4 model of a HPGe detector and WinXcom program to calculate the mass attenuation coefficient (MAC) at six energies between 356 and 2510 keV. In order to confirm the agreement between both methods, we used correlation theory and calculated the correlation coefficients (R-2) for each sample. It is found that the R-2 values are close to 1 for all samples. The MAC values at 356 keV for the prepared samples lies between 0.221 and 0.246 cm(2)/g. It is found that the usage of different concentration of PbO (from 50 to 70 mol%) affects the MAC values and thus the attenuation ability of the samples due to the heavier density of the PbO in comparison to B2O3. The effective atomic number results showed that Pb70B10 sample (contains 70 mol% of PbO) was higher than the other samples. Hence, Pb70B10 absorbs more photons than the rest of the prepared glasses.

AB The interfacial reaction and crystallization mechanism were evaluated in terms of the effect of pre-oxidation condition on the glass-to-metal sealing. The moderate oxidation of the alloy resulted in the formation of magnetite as the main crystalline phase in the oxide scale. The microstructural observation demonstrated that the glass-to-metal joint can be divided into four regions: the bulk metal region, the Fe depleted region, the transition region and the bulk glass region. However, higher oxidation degree of the alloy resulted in a thicker diffusion zone. The results show that the dissolution of oxide scale in glass inhibits the formation of fresnoite and enhances the formation of orthoclase. The crystallization mechanism of these two precipitate phases was discussed based on the dissolution of magnetite.

AB Nonlinearity is one of the most important optical properties widely used in opto-electronic devices. In this work, the optical nonlinearity of a series of Bismuth Borosilicate glasses is compared. The glasses prepared through conventional melt-quench technique comprises of Dy2O3, gold nanoparticles (GNPs) and both Dy2O3 and GNPs. XRD is used to confirm the amorphous nature of the glass whereas FESEM is carried out to observe variation in morphology of GNPs with the addition of Dy2O3. Effect of Dy2O3 on particle size is recorded using HRTEM. DTA is carried out to observe the variation in thermal behaviour of the material. The highest value of nonlinear absorption coefficient (4.35 x 10(-12) cmW(-1)) and third order nonlinear optical susceptibility of 8.68 x 10(-9) esu are observed from Z-scan for the glass containing both Dy2O3 and GNPs. The results conclude that the addition of Dy2O3 enhances the nonlinearity of glass containing gold and thus has promising applications in optical devices.

AB Dual-phase nanostructured amorphous/crystalline (A/C) model is an effective method to improve the mechanical properties of Mg alloys. However, the interaction behavior between A/C interface (ACI) and various defects is still unclear. Here, the interaction mechanisms between the basal/prismatic interface (BPI) arid ACI of dual-phase nanoscale A/C MgAI/Mg alloys are investigated by molecular dynamics simulation method. The results indicate that the ACIs have a significant Peach-Koehler (attractive or repulsive) force to govern the activation of interfacial dislocations in BPI. When the spacing between ACI and BPI (SAB) is less than 12.0 nm, it is found that the attractive force plays a dominant role in interfacial dislocation activation. On the contrary, the repulsive force has an effect on the activation of dislocations. The results also show that the maximum peak strain increases almost linearly with increasing SAB, and the maximum peak strain delay is attributed to the strain contributed by BPIs migration.

AB The subject of the studies is polyphosphate glass of 19Al(2)O(3)-19Fe(2)O(3)-62P(2)O(5) composition. The glass was investigated with the application of experimental methods like FT-IR, Raman, and Mossbauer spectroscopy. The obtained results were compared to theoretical studies which were conducted on different theory levels like MD, CPMD and DFT simulations. According to the conducted studies the phosphate network is built of different length chains which are joined by iron-oxygen and aluminum-oxygen polyhedrons which increase polymerization and rigidity of the glass network. The iron ions are nonuniformly distributed and form rich and poor regions. Mossbauer hyperfine interaction parameters were calculated and compared with the obtained experimental results. It was observed linear dependence of Mayer's bond order parameters on bond lengths and values of full valency were calculated. The values are comparable to the formal charges what gives an easy possibility to distinguish between Fe(III) and Fe(II) ions.

The obtained values of the nearest neighbours atomic distance (r(As-Se) = 2.37 +/- 0.01 angstrom; r(As-S), = 2.33 +/- 0.01 angstrom for As40Se30S30) suggest the existence of mixed AsS2Se and AsSe2S pyramids in which each of As atoms is bonded with S and/or Se atoms in relation to S/Se ratio in composition, while Se atoms are bonded only with As ones with the same bond distance in the form of = As-Se As = bridges that connect the main pyramidal structural units. No evidence for existence of heteroatomic or heteronuclear Se-S bonding is found for the examined glasses.

AB The aim of the current research is to investigate the low-temperature sintering of a nano-crystalline lithium-mica glass-ceramic. Sol-gel technique was used to prepare the glass-ceramics by application of LiMg3AlSi3(1+x)O10+6xF2 with various x values (0.25, 0.5, 0.75, and 1) and different amounts of MgF2 as the sintering aid. Use of appropriate amounts of additive and stoichiometric deviation (x) decreased the sintering temperature to 750 degrees C. Results also revealed that the highest relative density was achieved by applying the optimal amount of additive (4 wt%) with x = 1. The densification activation energy for the glass-ceramic containing 4 wt% MgF2 was calculated as 214.33 +/- 17 kJ mol(-1); it was lower than the sample containing 5 wt% additive; hence it was confirmed as optimal content. Consequently, considering densification and phase analysis, true optimum amounts of MgF2 were determined as 4, 4, 3 and 1 wt% for the glass-ceramics synthesized with x = 1, 0.75, 0.5 and 0.25, respectively.

AB Pure-silica-core F-doped-silica cladding fiber ("pure silica fiber", PSF) is subjected to eight pulsed-X-ray irradiations (pulse duration of 20 ns, mean photon energy of similar to 5 MeV). In each pulse, the probe light power at the wavelength lambda = 1.55 mu m is either 10 mW, or 33-40 mu W, the irradiation temperature being also varied among pulses from -80 to +85 degrees C. Post-pulse decay of radiation-induced absorption (RIA) in the PSF is measured at lambda = 1.55 mu m in the subsecond scale and, in four typical cases, is approximated in the framework of the second order -kinetic model to separate RIA due to inherent and strain-assisted self-trapped holes (STHs). Post-pulse RIA time evolution is found to be qualitatively different at the different probe light powers. At the 33-40-mu W power, RIA is virtually wholly described by inherent STHs with some admixture of strain-assisted ones only at the highest temperature of + 85 degrees C. At the 10-mW power, the RIA temporal run is found to be composed of two clear-cut successive domains due to inherent and strain-assisted STHs regardless of temperature. An enhanced probe light power and enhanced temperature are found to have a similar influence on the STHs of the two classes: they partly suppress the inherent STHs and promote the occurrence of the strain-assisted ones. A physical mechanism is proposed for the latter effect. Basic principles for selecting the best-suited probe light power at lambda = 1.55 mu m with regard to the application specifications are proposed.

AB Photoluminescence of nominally pure oxidized and fluorinated silica glasses, which have good optical transparency in the optical gap, has been investigated under excitation by excimer lasers. The data are compared with the data for chlorinated silica glass, as well as glass containing OH. The excitation of localized states provides the release and capture of charge carriers, despite the low absorption coefficient. The holes are self-trapped. The recombination in the thermally activated or tunnel process creates luminescence of oxygen-deficient centers. It is concluded that oxidation and fluorination do not change the concentration of localized states, but they change the electronic transitions of the localized states to higher energies. In type III glass with a high OH content, luminescence is suppressed by the presence of hydrogen and appears after irradiation with 7.9 eV photons of the F-2 laser. This observation suggests the existence of localized states even in these glasses.

ID FORMING ABILITY; REFRIGERANT CAPACITY
AB Magnetic cooling technology is a very promising alternative to conventional vapor compression refrigeration systems. Searching for suitable magnetocaloric materials with improved properties is a key issue in this field. In this work, we report thermal, magnetic and magnetocaloric properties of the Gd60Al25(NiCo)(15) bulk metallic glass. A completely amorphous sample of 3 mm in diameter is successfully fabricated by a vacuum suction casting method. The alloy demonstrates the distinct glass transition and near-eutectic melting. Magnetic measurements reveal ferromagnetic ordering in the BMG at about 91 K. We have found a field-induced magnetic transition in the glass, which provides a table-like behavior for the magnetic entropy changes. Due to this metamagnetic effect, the BMG demonstrates excellent magnetocaloric effect over a wide temperature range. The values of relative cooling power (RCP) and the full width of half maximum of magnetic entropy change (Delta T-FWHM) under a magnetic field of 5T are 890 J x kg(-1) and 141 K, respectively. All that makes this glass a promising candidate for magnetic refrigeration applications working at liquid-nitrogen temperatures.

AB The method for preparation of high-purity Ge-Se glasses with the low content of hydrogen and oxygen impurities is developed. The method includes following stages: selenium purification by chemical-distillation technique; passing selenium vapors over a mixture of Ge batch and 2 wt% of Al for loading the components into the reactor; glass melting, quenching and cooling. Optical losses in the unclad fiber did not exceed 1 dB/m in the spectral ranges 2.0-4.3 mu m and 4.8-7.8 mu m; the minimum optical losses were 0.77 dB/m at 5.6 mu m. The fiber is characterized by the record low content of oxygen, chemically bound to germanium, which is 0.013 +/- 0.002 ppm(wt), the concentration of hydrogen in the form of Se-H groups is 1.77 +/- 0.12 ppm(at). The silica reactor is shown to be the source of impurities of hydrogen, metals and heterogeneous particles in Ge-Se glasses.

The solubility and spontaneous crystallization behavior of PbCl2 are investigated by employing various techniques of XRD, SEM, and Raman spectra. Two-stage crystal growth was found in these samples with the increase of PbCl2 content (x). The crystallization behavior of oversaturation and recrystallization of PbCl2 in glasses is totally different from the typical nucleation and crystal growth initiated by thermal treatment. Especially, transparent chalcogenide glass-ceramic embedded PbCl2 nanoparticles (similar to 20 nm) was successfully fabricated when x reaches 10 mol%. This study is of guidance significance for future design and elaboration of optically functionalized chalcogenide glass-ceramics.

AB Three-point bending tests on unstrengthened annealed glass (AG) and chemically strengthened glass (CSG) were conducted under quasi-static and dynamic loading conditions to assess the flexural strength and failure' characteristics with the help of a high-speed camera. The flexural strength of CSG was higher than AG due to residual compressive stress. At higher loading speed, the flexural strength of both AG and CSG specimens was increased and the strength dispersion was decreased. Additionally, the flexural strength of AG and CSG notched specimens were explored and results revealed that the flexural strength decreased remarkably due to stress concentration effect. However, the flexural strength of CSG specimens was still much higher than AG specimens for the same notch depth. Numerical simulation of the notched CSG specimen showed that the stress near the notch region redistributes due to the strengthened layer, making it under compression before loading. Also, fractography analysis was discussed to characterize the crack pattern and deformation mechanism.

AB Hydrogen gas diffusivity of fourteen glasses of the Na2O-Al2O3-SiO2 system are studied along the joins quartzalbite-jadeite-nepheline (Qz-Ab-Jd-Np, fully polymerized) and albite-sodium disilicate (Ab-Ds, depolymerized). Density measurements show that ionic porosity decreases from 54.4% (Qz) to 51.5% (Np) and from 52.4% (Ab) to 50.2% (Ds). Hydrogen diffusivity D follows similar trends but at another scale. D at 523 K decreases from 4 x 10(-12) to 3 x 10(-14) m(2)s(-1) (Qz-Np) and from 4 x 10(-13) to 3 x 10(-15) m(2)s(-1) (Ab-Ds). Charge compensating Na+ acting as a filling agent in fully polymerized network structures leads to up to one order of magnitude higher diffusivities as depolymerized glass structures of the same SiO2 content where Na+ takes the role of a modifier ion. Temperature dependence of the diffusivity indicates that both the activation energy involved with the moving H-2 molecule as well as the accessible volume in the structure contribute to this compositional trend.

AB Be-Na-(Li)-Si oxide glasses containing up to 15 mol% of BeO were prepared. Their structure was characterized by X-ray powder diffraction and Raman as well as infrared spectroscopic techniques, while their chemical compositions were examined by Inductively Coupled Plasma Optical Emission Spectrometry. All materials were found to be amorphous and contain Al contaminations from minor dissolution of the alumina crucibles. The results of Raman and IR spectroscopies showed that BeO addition to Na-(Li)-Si glass systems resulted in the formation of [BeO4/2](2-) tetrahedra which are inserted into the silicate glass network, demonstrating the intermediate glass-forming role of BeO. In parallel, the effective destruction of Si-O-Si bridges was observed by vibrational spectroscopy. The glass transition temperature was studied by Differential Thermal Analysis and found to range from about 431 degrees C to 551 degrees C. A significant increase in T-g by 70 degrees C was found as SiO2 was substituted by up to 15 mol% BeO.

AB The glasses and glass-ceramics in Li2O-Al2O3-SiO2 system containing three complex nucleating agents (TiO2 + ZrO2 + P2O5) were prepared respectively. The effects of P2O5 content on crystallization mechanism and microstructure were researched by means of Differential Scanning Calorimetry, X-Ray Diffraction, Raman Spectra, Fourier Transform Infrared and Scanning Election Microscopy. Simultaneously, the effects of structure and composition on thermal expansion coefficient, transmittance, Vickers hardness, density, bending strength, and chemical stability were also discussed. The results indicated that P2O5 can promote the nucleation and crystallization process by forming AlPO4 and accelerating the precipitation of ZrTiO4. With the increase of P2O5 content (less 5 wt%), the promoting effect of elevated crystallization temperature on the process of grain grown enhanced gradually. Especially when P2O5 content is 5 wt%, the sample have the smallest crystals and the best performance, and there is a relatively low temperature and wide temperature range where could keep the grain size of P5 samples almost unchanged.

AB A novel CuO-ZnO-B2O3-Li2O glass-ceramic was prepared by solid phase method, and. Its phase transition, sintering and dielectric performance was studied. No crystalline phase is observed for the specimen sintered at 560 degrees C. However, the samples sintered at 580 degrees C and 600 degrees C, consist of ZnB4O7 and Cu2B4O7. And the Li2CuB4O8 appears with further increasing temperature. The epsilon(r) and tau(f) change slightly but the Q x f value alter greatly with firing temperature. The glass-ceramic fired at 620 degrees C possesses optimum properties with epsilon(r) = 3.33, Q x f = 17,724 GHz and tau(f) approximate to 0 ppm/degrees C. Furthermore, the as-prepared glass-ceramic exhibits good co-firing compatibility with Ag and Al electrode. These properties qualify the dielectric material as promising alternatives for wireless communication applications.

AB In this study, effects of Mo and V substitution for Fe on a direct aim of synchronously optimizing glass forming ability (GFA) and soft magnetic properties of Fe-based amorphous/nanocrystalline alloys fabricated by melt spinning technology are investigated. The introduces of Mo and V had an effective impedance of atoms migration and contributed to the improvement of GFA of Fe73.5-xSi15.5B7Cu1Nb3Mx (M = Mo, V) soft magnetic alloys. The formation of alpha-Fe phase was kept in a stable temperature scale, while the residual amorphous precipitation showed a better thermal stability against precipitating Fe-B compounds. After a suitable annealing process at T-a = 560 degrees C for 60 min, the alpha-Fe grains with introducing V had a smaller average size than that of introducing Mo. For the crystallized ribbons, the introduce of V revealed not only a slower decrease of B-s, but also a more sluggish increase of H-c. The B, and H, were in the range of 0.91 T - 1.07 T and 2.0-3.5 A/m, respectively. These alloys with V = 1 at.% and Mo = 0.5 at.% exhibited higher effective permeability (mu(e)) in the frequency range of 1-200 kHz and 60-200 kHz, respectively. Therefore, the balance between Fe, V and Mo is a key factor to keep B-s in a moderate field and relatively lower H meanwhile it can also improve mu(e) in testing frequency scale. V additions are more beneficial to restrain grain growth, reduce B-s and increase H-c rather than those of Mo. Therefore, V-doped Finemet-type soft magnetic alloy and its nanocrystalline derivations become a potential candidate as transformer core material in wide frequency scale of 1-200 kHz.

AB This paper reports the development of a hot embossing method for fabricating chalcogenide microlens arrays using soft polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) stamps. The stamps are formed by molding PDMS on photoresist masters fabricated with sphere segments by thermal reflow. Upon proper temperatures, the chalcogenide glass softens and is embossed using PDMS stamps with low pressure. Void defects at the center and at the side of microlenses are found, and the mechanisms for the void formation are investigated and verified. The hot embossing parameters including pressure, temperature, embossing time, and the thicknesses of the PDMS stamps are optimized. A 400 x 400 microlens array with uniform profiles, smooth surface roughness, and good roundness have been successfully fabricated on both chalcogenide thin films and bulk wafers. The preliminary results demonstrate the feasibility of using hot embossing with soft PDMS stamps as a simple and low cost method to fabricate chalcogenide microlens arrays.

AB Previous experimental observations have demonstrated that large stress gradient results in high plasticity, while the underlying mechanism and constitutive laws are rarely reported. In this work, a micro-mechanics based model was proposed to account for the contribution made by hydrostatic stress. This micro-mechanics model was then incorporated into the free volume model describing the viscous softening behavior and a generalized constitutive law was established. Using a user material subroutine (UMAT) and von-Mises criterion, the new constitutive equations were implemented into a finite element code to simulate the material response and free volume evolution procedure under tensile and compressive loading when hydrostatic stress was taken into account. Furthermore, comparison was made between current simulation and previous theoretical or experimental results, good agreement was successfully obtained. Therefore, it is concluded that the current constitutive law is a good candidate for describing the deformation behavior of metallic glass under complex stress states.

AB The intrinsic fracture mechanism of bulk metallic glasses (BMGs) is often obscured with the involvement of normal stress. To decouple the normal-stress effect, a double-notched shearing technique is developed to investigate the mechanical properties of BMGs. Real-time shear banding and fracture behavior under quasi-static and dynamic shearing are captured by using high-speed photographing, which confirms multiple shear banding at low strain rates and single shear banding at high strain rates. More importantly, the transition from shear band to crack could be observed with little influence of normal stress. Such transition is found to be induced by cavitation mechanism and shows obvious rate dependence; that is originated from regularly distributed controllable cavities under quasi-static loading, while from a series of concentrated cavitation under dynamic loading. Referring to studies under compression and tension, we clarify that strain rate controls cavitation concentration level and normal stress controls cavitation instabilities, respectively.

AB Release of carbon materials (CMs) into water and wastewater treatment systems occurs due to their increasing utilization as adsorbents for water treatment. When the CMs, mixed with natural organic matter (NOM), interact with disinfectants used during water treatment (e.g. chlorine), the released CMs can affect the formation of disinfection byproducts (DBPs). In this study, three common CMs were investigated to reveal their possible effects and the mechanisms of DBP formation during the chlorination of NOM. The experimental results indicate that DBPs generation decreased by 10-40% in the presence of CMs when Suwannee River humic acid (SRHA) was chlorinated. The adsorption of SRHA by CMs was hypothesized as the major cause for the DBPs inhibition. CMs could irreversibly adsorb DBP precursors in their mesopores through pi-pi bonding and hydrophobic effects. OH groups on the surface of CMs were shown to be critical for DBPs inhibition through linking with the OH or COOH groups on the surface of NOM via hydrogen bonding. The study also showed that water chemistry parameters, such as pH and salinity, can affect DBP formation by changing the adsorption of NOM onto CMs. With diverse NOM components, the presence of CMs resulted in decreased formation of trichloromethane from 57.1 mu g/L to 23.8, 38.4, and 40.4 mu g/L when coal-made activated carbon (CAC), wheat straw-made BC pyrolyzed at 300 degrees C (WSBC300), and multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs), respectively, were added to surface water; and from 30.6 mu g/L to 20.0, 19.2, and 13.2 mu g/L when CAC, WSBC300, and MWCNTs, respectively, were added to wastewater.

TI Unified and rapid assessment of climate resilience of urban drainage

AB Urban drainage system (UDS) researchers have applied the concept of resilience for minimizing the magnitude and duration of urban flooding in response to climate change. Currently, the relationship between conventional design and resilience analysis still remains unknown, while persistent rain has not been included in resilience assessment. The present study proposes new metrics by means of resilience profile graph for UDS stressed by synthetic short-duration storms and real persistent rains. The graph unifies the concepts of reliability, robustness, resilience and failure, as well as design standards for sewer surcharging, sewer flooding and property flooding, which are linked into curves to show a complete performance under climate stress scenarios. The obtained results show that resilience profile curves for short-duration storms are well fitted by power functions with coefficient of determination 98.13%-99.9%. Chicago hyetograph was used as critical input hyetograph where the error range was -0.34%-6.83% compared with actual hyetograph. Resilience profile graphs for persistent rains reveal that resilience assessment based on short-duration storms underestimates the effect of persistent rains, and it can be obtained by using segmental and reference reliability metrics to reduce working time from weeks to hours. For the rain of the same intensity, resilience to persistent rain was 18.4-33.1% lower than for single rains. Threat of persistent rain doesn't fall under the rains of high intensity but under large rainfall in total (which exceeds 25% of local annual rainfall), while re-planning water landscape as retarding basin reduces the impact of persistent rains to 5.8-11.8%.

AB This study investigated the transformation of secondary amine pharmaceuticals in UV-C/NO3- and in nitrate-rich wastewater at 254 nm by taking diclofenac, diphenylamine, mefenamic acid and furosemide as probe compounds. The degradation of targeted compounds were positively related to nitrate concentration and mainly caused by the formation of peroxynitrite and related reactive nitrogen species (e.g., nitrogen oxide and nitrogen dioxide radicals). Major transformation products were identified to provide fundamental understanding of the selective oxidation of secondary amine with reactive nitrogen species. UV photolysis, hydroxyl radical oxidation, nitration and nitrosation processes were found to be the most significant transformation pathways. In case of diphenylamine, for which most of the identified intermediates were available as standard, the relative significance of each transformation route could be established, highlighting for the first time the important role of N-nitrosation processes in UV/NO3- treatment followed by the decomposition of the resulting N-nitroso compounds by an alpha hydroxylation mechanism. This specific transformation pathway was of concern because it constitutes the molecular basis of N-nitrosamine carcinogenicity and may contribute to the increase in effluent genotoxicity under UV-C treatment in addition to the formation of nitrophenols. Hydrogenocarbonate ions at concentration values higher than 300 mg/L appeared to be a protective specie against nitrosation processes due to the formation of carbamate adducts but H2O2 in UV-C/H2O2 could be responsible for an exacerbation of the N-nitrosation pathway due to an addition source of hydroxyl radical in the system. The occurrence of major transformation products of diclofenac was confirmed in nitrate-rich wastewater under UV-C treatment at pilot-scale operation. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In-situ sludge reduction can be achieved by inserting an anaerobic side-stream reactor in the sludge return line of the conventional activated sludge (CAS) process. This modified oxic-settling-anaerobic (OSA) process can reduce sludge production by 30-50% through feast-fast alternating conditions. This paper proposes a new bioprocess called the sulfidogenic oxic-settling anaerobic (SOSA) process with OSA configuration and the addition of sulfate in side-stream reactor. The new bioprocess augments the conventional anaerobic/anoxic/aerobic feast-fast bioconversions with sulfur biochemical transformations (i.e. sulfate reduction and sulfur-oxidizing autotrophic denitrification). A lab-scale SOSA process was operated for 260 days in parallel with the anoxic/oxic (AO) CAS process and the conventional OSA process as control systems. Based on the experimental results, the feasibility of the new SOSA process was evaluated, and the effects of sulfur bioaugmentation on the effluent quality, sludge reduction, sludge physico-chemical properties and microbial communities were examined. The SOSA process i) removed 98% of the organics (chemical oxygen demand, COD) and 99% of the ammonia present with a lower observed sludge yield (0.204 g TSS/g CODremoved) than those of the OSA and AO processes (0.292 and 0.473 g TSS/g CODremoved respectively), ii) denitrified 18% and 6% more nitrogen to dinitrogen gas than did the CAS and OSA processes respectively, iii) produced sludge with improved settleability and dewaterability, iv) encouraged sludge decomposition with greater destruction of extracellular polymeric substances and v) enriched sulfur-cycle related and hydrolytic/fermentative bacteria. The possible mechanisms of sulfur augmentation and limitations of the present study are also discussed. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Ozonation is widely used in wastewater treatment but the associated byproduct formation is a concern. When ozonation is used in the presence of bromide, bromate is generally considered as a major byproduct, and few studies have examined the toxicity of organic byproducts. This study was designed to investigate the cytotoxicity, genotoxicity and DNA/RNA oxidative damage to Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells of organic extracts from ozonated wastewater in the absence or presence of bromide. Ozonation effectively detoxified secondary effluents containing no bromide. However, ozonation significantly increased the cytotoxicity and genotoxicity of the effluents spiked with a bromide concentration as low as 100 mu g/L, compared with the bromide-free effluent. When the bromide concentration in the effluent was increased to 2000 mu g/L, ozonation resulted in 1.4-1.5 times the cytotoxicity and 1.5-5.0 times the genotoxicity of the non-ozonated secondary effluent. Besides, the oxidative stress (including reactive oxygen species and reactive nitrogen species) and DNA/RNA oxidative damage also became more severe and a high level of 8-hydroxy-(deoxy)guanosine was detected in the CHO cell nucleus in the presence of bromide. Cytotoxicity and genotoxicity were found to increase with the formation of total organic bromine (TOBr). When the CHO cells were exposed to both the organic byproducts and bromate formed from wastewater containing 500 and 2000 mu g/L bromide, bromate significantly increased oxidative stress and DNA/RNA oxidative damage at relatively high concentration factors, suggesting both organic byproduct and bromate can contribute to toxicity increase. During ozonation of the effluent containing bromide, particular attention should be paid to the organic byproducts such as TOBr. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Nitrous oxide (N2O) emitted from biological nutrient removal activated sludge systems contributes significantly to the total carbon footprint of modern wastewater treatment plants. In the present study, N2O production and emissions were experimentally determined in a large-scale plant (220,000 PE) employing combined nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) removal. As a modelling tool, the Activated Sludge Model 2d (ASM2d) was extended with modules describing multiple N2O production pathways and N2O liquid-gas transfers. The new model was calibrated and validated using the results of laboratory experiments and full-scale measurements. Different operational strategies were evaluated following the proposed model-based procedure. Heterotrophic denitrification was found to be the predominant pathway of N2O production under both anoxic and aerobic conditions. This behaviour could primarily be attributed to the predominant abundance of heterotrophic denitrifiers over nitrifiers. Simulations revealed that the optimal solution for minimizing liquid N2O production is to set the dissolved oxygen concentration in the aerobic zone from 1 to 2 mg O-2/L and to enhance the mixed liquor recirculation rate (MLR) (>500% of the influent fiowrate) while not compromising effluent standards. Regarding the actual conditions, the potential reduction in the carbon footprint was estimated to be 10% by applying the proposed operational strategy. The results suggest that considerable improvements can be achieved without substantial upgrades and increased costs. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Membrane distillation (MD) has a great potential in treating high salinity industrial wastewater due to its unique characteristics. Nevertheless, the implementation of MD for industrial wastewater reclamation must be conducted with precaution because low-surface-tension contaminates in feed solutions may easily wet the membranes. In recent years, omniphobic membranes that exhibit strong repellence towards liquids with a wide range of surface tensions have been proposed as a promising solution to deal with the wetting problem. In this paper, we aim to provide a comprehensive review of omniphobic interfaces and illustrate their fundamental working principles, innovative design approaches and novel applications on membrane distillation. The review may provide insights in designing stable solid-liquid-vapor interfaces and serve as a guidance for the development of robust anti-wetting membranes for industrial wastewater reclamation via membrane distillation.

AB The oxidation of chlorendic acid (CA), a polychlorinated recalcitrant contaminant, by heat-, mineral-, and base-activated persulfate was investigated. In pH 3-12 homogeneous (i.e., solid-free) solutions, CA was oxidized by (OH)-O-center dot and SO4.- radicals, resulting in a nearly stoichiometric production of Cl-. The rate constants for the reaction between these radicals and CA were measured at different temperatures by electron pulse radiolysis, and were found to be k(OH) = (8.71 +/- 0.17) x 10(7) M(-1)s(-1) and k(SO4) = (6.57 +/- 0.83) x 107 M(-1)s(-1) at 24.5 degrees C for (OH)-O-center dot and SO4.-, respectively. CA was oxidized at much slower rates in solutions containing iron oxyhydroxide or aquifer soils, partially due to the adsorption of CA on these solids. To gain further insight into the effect of solids during in-situ remediation of CA, the adsorption of CA onto iron (hydr)oxide, manganese dioxide, silica, alumina, and aquifer soils was investigated. The fraction of CA that was adsorbed on these materials increased as the solution pH decreased. Given that the solution pH can decrease dramatically in persulfate-based remedial systems, adsorption may reduce the ability of persulfate to oxidize CA. Overall, the results of this study provide important information about how persulfate can be used to remediate CA-contaminated sites. The results also indicate that the groundwater pH and geology of the subsurface can have a significant influence on the mobility of CA. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Previous research has focused on dissolved organic carbon (DOC) as a surrogate for soluble microbial products (SMPs) and found that temperature has a significant influence on the production of SMP-based DOC (SDOC) during biological processes. Little is known about the SMP-based dissolved organic nitrogen (SOON), although some nitrogenous organic matter has been identified as an important part of SMPs. This study investigated the effect of temperature (8 degrees C, 15 degrees C and 25 degrees C) on the characterization of SMPs in an activated sludge system with special emphasis on SDON. Results showed the positive effect of reduced temperature on SDON production. Fluorescence spectroscopy and ultrahigh-resolution mass spectrometry showed the produced SDON at 8 degrees C and 15 degrees C exhibits more lability than at 25 degrees C. This was also supported by the algal bioassay, indicating the SDON produced at low temperature is highly bioavailable and prone to stimulate algae and microorganisms. In addition, principal component analysis demonstrated that the effect of temperature on the chemical characterization of SDON is different from that of SDOC. Overall, this study highlights the importance of SDON control during biological processes at a low temperature to reduce the potential impact of effluent SMPs on receiving waters or wastewater reuse.

AB Concrete corrosion in sewers is primarily caused by H2S in sewer atmosphere. H2S concentration can vary from several ppm to hundreds of ppm in real sewers. Our understanding of sewer corrosion has increased dramatically in recent years, however, there is limited knowledge of the concrete corrosion at high H2S levels. This study examined the corrosion development in sewers with high H2S concentrations. Fresh concrete coupons, manufactured according to sewer pipe standards, were exposed to corrosive conditions in a pilot-scale gravity sewer system with gaseous H2S at 1100 100 ppm. The corrosion process was continuously monitored by measuring the surface pH, corrosion product composition, corrosion loss and the microbial community. The surface pH of concrete was reduced from 10.5 +/- 0.3 to 3.1 +/- 0.5 within 20 days and this coincided with a rapid corrosion rate of 3.5 +/- 0.3 mm year(-1). Microbial community analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequencing indicated the absence of sulfide-oxidizing microorganisms in the corrosion layer. The chemical analysis of corrosion products supported the reaction of cement with sulfuric acid formed by the chemical oxidation of H2S. The rapid corrosion of concrete in the gravity pipe was confirmed to be caused by the chemical oxidation of hydrogen sulfide at high concentrations. This is in contrast to the conventional knowledge that is focused on microbially induced corrosion. This first-ever systematic investigation shows that chemically induced oxidation of H2S leads to the rapid corrosion of new concrete sewers within a few weeks. These findings contribute novel understanding of in-sewer corrosion processes and hold profound implications for sewer operation and corrosion management. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB A partial nitritation (PN)/anaerobic ammonium oxidation (ANAMMOX) process in sequencing batch reactor (SBR) was successfully developed to treat high-strength ammonium wastewater. The feed distribution in the SBR cycle and sub-cycles was considered as the main operating strategy, and was optimized using a response surface methodology (RSM)-based optimization technique. In the SBR cycle, the maximum nitrogen removal rate (NRR) of 0.79 +/- 0.01 kg m(-3) d(-1) was achieved by applying a feed distribution strategy that considered the kinetic characteristics of ANAMMOX and ammonia oxidizing bacteria (AOB). However, this strategy negatively affected the nitrogen removal efficiency (NRE) due to alkalinity loss. Therefore, the feed distribution in the SBR sub-cycles with respect to the NRE and the NRR was further studied. The nitrogen removal performance was optimized in the optimum region and an NRE of 88% and an NRR of 0.84 kg m(-3) d(-1) were achieved. The optimized model was verified in confirmation test. The RSM-based optimization results provide insights into the feed distribution strategy for achieving single-stage PN/ANAMMOX SBR operation. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The increasing occurrence of harmful algal blooms in surface waters may increase the input of algal organic matter (AOM) to the dissolved organic matter pool. The formation of iodinated trihalomethanes (I-THMs) and noniodinated disinfection byproducts (DBPs) in synthetic waters containing AOM extracted from Microcystis aeruginosa was investigated in chloramination (preformed and in-situ formed chloramine, NH2Cl and Cl-2-NH2Cl, respectively) and chlorination (Cl-2) processes. AOM is much more favorable for iodine incorporation than natural organic matter (NOM). For example, the formation of I-THM from AOM is much higher than NOM isolate extracted from treated water (e.g., 3.5 times higher in the NH2Cl process), and thus higher iodine utilization and substitution factors from AOM were observed. Short contact time (2 min) chlorination in Cl-2-NH2Cl process leading to the formation of halogenated intermediates favored I-THM formation, compared with NH2Cl process. However, further increasing chlorine contact time from 5 min to 24 h facilitated the conversion from iodide to iodate and thus I-THM formation decreased. Meanwhile, the formation of noniodinated THM4, haloacetonitriles (HANs), and haloacetaldehydes (HALs) increased. Factors including concentrations of AOM and bromide, pH, and chlorine/nitrogen ratios influenced the formation of I-THMs and noniodinated DBPs. To evaluate the benefit of mitigating I-THM formation over the risk of noniodinated DBP formation, measured DBPs were weighed against their mammalian cell toxicity indexes. Increasing the chlorine exposure increased the calculated cytotoxicity based on concentrations of measured I-THMs and noniodinated DBPs since unregulated HANs and HALs were the controlling agents.

AB With the rapid construction of dams worldwide, reservoir system has become a representation of modern aquatic environment. However, the profiles of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) and associated factor influencing their dynamics in modern aquatic environment (e.g., water phase, sediment phase, and soil phase) are largely unknown. Here, we comprehensively characterized the diversity, abundance, distribution of ARGs in a large drinking water reservoir using high-throughput quantitative PCR, as well as ranked the factors (e.g., mobile genetic elements (MGEs), bacteria community, bacterial biomass, antibiotics, and basic properties) influencing the profiles of ARGs on the basis of structural equation models (SEMs). Water phase was prone to harbor more diverse ARGs as compared to sediment phase and soil phase, and soil phase in drawdown area was a potential reservoir and hotspot for ARGs. Environmental media partially affected the ARG diversity in modern aquatic environment, while it observably influenced the distributions of ARGs and MGEs and their co-occurrence patterns. The pathways for the proliferation and spread of ARGs in water phase were both the horizontal gene transfer (HGT) and vertical gene transfer (VGT), while the dominant pathways in sediment phase and soil phase were the HGT and VGT, respectively. The SEMs demonstrated that MGEs contributed the most to drive the ARG dynamics in both water phase and sediment phase, while the most dominant factor for this in soil phase was bacterial community. Overall, environmental media exerted a bottleneck in driving the dynamics of ARGs in modern aquatic environment probably via diversifying the MGEs, bacterial community, bacterial biomass, antibiotics and basic properties.

AB Fertilized agroecosystems may show considerable leaching of the mobile nitrogen (N) compound NO3-, which pollutes groundwater and causes eutrophication of downstream waterbodies. Riparian buffer zones, positioned between terrestrial and aquatic environments, effectively remove NO3- and serve as a hotspot for N2O emissions. However, microbial processes governing NO3- reduction in riparian zones still remain largely unclear. This study explored the underlying mechanisms of various N-loss processes in riparian soil horizons using isotopic tracing techniques, molecular assays, and high-throughput sequencing. Both anaerobic ammonium oxidation (anammox) and denitrification activity were maximized in the riparian fringe rather than in the central zones. Denitrifying anaerobic methane oxidation (damo) process was not detected. Interestingly, both contrasting microbial habitats were separated by a groundwater table, which forms an important biogeochemical interface. Denitrification dominated cumulative N-losses in the upper unsaturated soil, while anammox dominated the lower oxic saturated soil horizons. Archaeal and bacterial ammonium oxidation that couple dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium (DNRA) with a high cell-specific rate promoted anammox even further in oxic subsurface horizons. High-throughput sequencing and network analysis showed that the anammox rate positively correlated with Candidatus 'Kuenenia' (4%), rather than with the dominant Candidatus Brocadia. The contribution to N-loss via anammox increased significantly with the water level, which was accompanied by a significant reduction of N2O emission (similar to 39.3 +/- 10.6%) since N-loss by anammox does not cause N2O emissions. Hence, water table management in riparian ecotones can be optimized to reduce NO3- pollution by shifting from denitrification to the environmentally friendly anammox pathway to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions.

AB We have prepared core/shell structured hollow Fe-Pd@C nanomaterials derived from Fe-metal organic frameworks which were synthesized via cheap, fast and simple mechanochemical technique. The obtained Fe-Pd@C can steadily and continuously release Fe2+ from the galvanic corrosion of Fe0 anode to trigger H2O2 decomposition into hydroxyl radicals and cause fast (10 min) and efficient (mineralization rate 95%) degradation of phenol. The presence of low level of Pd NPs in Fe-Pd@C (mass ratio of the raw material: Fe/Pd = 100:1) facilitated fast Fe3+/Fe2+ redox cycle and thus improved the catalytic performance and pH endurance of the Fe-Pd@C. After recycled four times, Fe-Pd@C remained high catalytic performance and released low level of iron ions (2.5 mg L-1), which reduced the production of iron sludge after usage. In contrast to zero-valent iron (ZVI) and commercial physically mixed Fe/C materials, the core/shell structure of Fe-Pd@C ensured efficient electron transferring from Fe0 to carbon cathode and targets, and prevented the precipitation of iron ions on Fe0 surface, avoiding the deactivation of Fe-0 and termination of Fe-C internal micro-electrolysis (IME) and extending their service life. The reactive species quenching experiments and ESR characterization proved the synergistic effect of electrons and hydroxyl free radicals on degradation of phenol. The carbon-centered DMPO radical detected in reaction solution can be regarded as a proof for the strengthened oxidation ability of the combined IME and Fenton reaction. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Both huge volume and high moisture content of municipal sludge have brought great troubles and attracted extensive concerns in the world. In this paper, the mechanical press filtration (MPF) dewatering was performed under ultrahigh pressure in order to improve the dewatering performance of municipal sludge. Low-Field Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) technique was used to study the effect of MPF parameters on dewatering performance. Based on the pore characteristics of municipal sludge, a capillary bundle model was developed to explore the mesoscopic mechanisms of MPF dewatering. The results indicate that moisture content of sludge cake decreases gradually with the increase of compressed pressure and dewatering time as well as the decrease of sludge weight , and the moisture content of municipal sludge can be reduced to as low as 30% with MPF dewatering. According to the peak and envelope area of relaxation time curve in NMR, it can be found that the size of pores decreases and the percentage of small pores increases during the dewatering process. Therefore, the capillary water cannot be removed by MPF method because the capillary pressure in very small pores increases evidently. Furthermore, the compaction degree of the outmost layer is generally higher than that of the middle layer, and the difference of moisture content between the middle and outmost layers of cake is 25%-28.4%. The present work may be helpful to understand the MPF dewatering mechanism and shed light on the new dewatering techniques of municipal sludge. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The present work aimed to assess the sorption capacity of the common white bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) to remove Zn(II) from rainwater, rendering it suitable for use in buildings, and the efficiency of the process was evaluated for two initial Zn(II) concentrations, representing high (100 mu g L-1) and very high (500 mu g L-1) levels of Zn(II) in rainwater. The effects of the amount of beans (1, 5 and 10 beans per 50 mL), as well as the initial pH values of the zinc solution [acid (4), neutral (5.6) and basic (7) for atmospheric waters] were also assessed. The removal of Zn from water was affected by the change in pH values. When 5 and 10 beans were used, after 4 h and 2 h of contact time, respectively, the accumulated Zn(II) on the beans was released back into the solution, and this release occurred first for the highest tested pH value. The sorption rate of Zn(II) from the solution increased with the increasing amount of beans, but for 5 and 10 beans this only took place up to 4 h and 2 h, respectively. Furthermore, the removal percentages of Zn(II) increased with the increase of the initial concentrations of the metal in water. Kinetic studies revealed that a pseudo-first-order model provided the best fitting for the experimentally obtained values. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy coupled with attenuated total reflectance (FTIR-ATR) analyses of the bean shells and cores indicated that contact with a Zn(II) solution did not cause notable alterations to the chemical structures of these bean components. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) analyses suggested that the process of sorption occurred at the surface of the beans (shells). The results obtained in this study also suggest that the matrix of rainwater samples did not interfere with the removal of metal, and that the process of the removal of Zn(II) by the white beans can be applied to real samples. On the whole, results indicate that for the removal of Zn(II) from rainwater, 1 bean up to 6 h, or 5 and 10 beans up to 2 h can be used per 50 mL for the removal of up to 60% of Zn(II) present in water, thus constituting a viable solution for the effective reduction of this metal in rainwater.

AB 2-Methylisoborneol (2-MIB) is one of the most common taste and odor (T&O) compounds in waterbodies and causes complaints from drinking water consumers. This is a case study of two water treatment plants taking the raw water from Lake Tai, the third largest lake in China. The relationships between the 2-MIB concentration and algae density, light change and nutrients of the raw water for the most recent four years were comprehensively investigated. The yearly variation pattern of the 2-MIB concentration in the raw water is closely related to the algae cell density. Both values reached peaks in July or August with concentrations as high as similar to 500 ng/L and similar to 1000 X 10(4) count/L, respectively. For the diurnal 2-MIB variation, the concentrations increase from 5 to 6 am, reach a peak value at similar to 12 p.m., and then gradually decrease and achieve the lowest value at night. These results further confirm that 2-MIB is highly related to algae cell activity (e.g., photosynthesis). In addition, 2-MIB exists both inside and outside algae cells (i.e., intracellular and extracellular or bound and dissolved 2-MIB, respectively), and the percentage of the extracellular/dissolved portion was as high as 60% during the study period. Conventional water treatment processes (usually referrings to coagulation sedimentation and sand filtration, CSF) in WTPs have extremely unstable 2-MIB removal efficiencies (from -20% to >95%), which is mainly related to the existing forms of 2-MIB. The intracellular/bound portion can be effectively removed by CSF, especially sand filtration, while advanced water treatment processes are required to remove the dissolved 2-MIB. An ozone-activated carbon process is recommended, and the 2-MIB removal rate can reach 100%. This research has great theoretical and engineering value for treating water containing T&O compounds.

AB The potential risks of brominated flame retardants (BFRs) like tetrabromobisphenol A (TBBPA) have attracted much attention. However, the influence of TBBPA on functional microbes remains poorly understood, especially with regards to denitrification, which is closely related with the carbon and nitrogen cycles, eutrophication and greenhouse gas emission. Herein, we found that 1.0 mg/L of TBBPA significantly decreased the total nitrogen removal efficiency by 81.7%, but increased the accumulation of NO2-N (by 81.5%) and N2O (by 172-fold). This was found to be underlie by the significant decrease in both the denitrifying capability of denitrifiers and total bacterial population. Further investigation revealed that TBBPA inhibited the pathways of glucolysis and pentose phosphate, and promoted glyoxylate bypass via regulating genes expressions of key enzymes (such as glucose-6-phosphate isomerase, pyruvate dehydrogenase, isocitrate lyase, etc.), then decreased the generation of NADH serving as electron donor for denitrification, and inhibited the denitrifying capability of denitrifiers. Moreover, insufficient NADH stimulated the accumulation of denitrifying intermediates (NO2-N and N2O), which induced the increase of reactive nitrogen species (RNS), whose accumulation decreased proliferation and increased apoptosis of denitrifying bacteria. Finally, the decrease in the denitrifying capability of denitrifier and bacterial population resulted in negative denitrifying performance. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Greywater recycling and rainwater harvesting have the potential to increase the resilience of water management and reduce the need for investment in conventional water supply schemes. However, their water-savings would partly depend on the location and built-form of urban development and hence its household sizes and rainwater per dwelling. We have therefore tested how spatial planning options would affect the future viability of alternative water supply in the Greater South East of England. Our integrated modelling framework, for the first time, forecasts the future densities and variability of built-form to provide inputs to the modelling of alternative water supply. We show that using projections of the existing housing stock would have been unsound, and that using standard dwelling types and household sizes would have substantially overestimated the water-savings, by not fully representing how the variability in dwelling dimensions and household-sizes would affect the cost effectiveness of these systems. We compare the spatial planning trend over a 30 year period with either compaction at higher densities within existing urban boundaries, or market-led more dispersed development. We show how the viability of alternative water supply would differ between these three spatial planning options. The water-savings of rainwater harvesting would vary greatly at a regional scale depending on residential densities and rainfall. Greywater recycling would be less affected by spatial planning but would have a finer balance between system costs and water-savings and its feasibility would vary locally depending on household sizes and water efficiency. The sensitivity of the water savings to differences in rainfall and water prices would vary with residential density. The findings suggest that forecasts of residential densities, rainfall and the water price could be used in conjunction with more detailed local studies to indicate how spatial planning would affect the future water saving potential of alternative water supply.

AB Primary microplastics are mostly produced as part of the daily plastic product use. The emission process is often invisible but poses potential ecological hazards. Thus, primary microplastics deserve public attention. Due to China's huge population base and its rapid economic development, primary micro plastics emissions are of both regional and global significance. This study is the first to establish the emission inventory of primary microplastics in mainland China. It was estimated that the primary microplastic waste from mainland China amounts to 737.29 Gg, and one-sixth of this amount entered the aquatic environment in 2015. The highest proportion of this waste was attributable to tire dust and synthetic fiber, accounting for 53.91% and 28.77% of the total respectively, in mainland China. The primary microplastics emissions mainly depend on the population, followed by the level of economic development. It was roughly estimated that 538 g of microplastics is produced by each person in China. At the grid scale, the spatial difference in the total primary microplastics emissions in mainland China primarily depends on the population density distribution and transportation network. We studied the entire life cycle of several sources of microplastics, from production to discharge into the aquatic environment. We suggested different control measures under different nodes. Increasing microplastics treatment in sewage treatment plants should be a short-term viable way to achieve some measure of reduction in their entry to the environment in mainland China. Our research can not only raise public awareness about primary microplastics, but can also guide the development of environmental policies to reduce plastic pollution. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

AB River bank filtration (RBF) is considered to efficiently remove nitrate and trace organic micropollutants (OMP) from polluted surface waters. This is essential for maintaining good groundwater quality and providing high quality drinking water. Predicting the fate of OMP during RBF is difficult as the biogeochemical factors controlling the removal efficiency are not fully understood. To determine in-situ removal efficiency and degradation rates of nitrate and OMP indicator substances we conducted a field study in a RBF system during a period of one and a half years incorporating temporally and spatially varying redox conditions and temperature changes typically occurring in temperate climates. RBF was analyzed by means of mixing ratios between infiltrated river water and groundwater as well as average residence times of surface water towards the individual groundwater observation wells. These results were used to calculate temperature dependent first order degradation rates of redox sensitive species and several OMP. Five out of ten investigated OMP were completely removed along RBF pathways. We demonstrate that degradation rates of several OMP during bank filtration were controlled by redox conditions and temperature whereby temperature itself also had a significant influence on the extent of the most reactive oxic zone. The seasonal variations in temperature alone could explain a considerable percentage of the variance in dissolved oxygen (34%), nitrate (81%) as well as the OMPs diclofenac (44%) and sulfamethoxazole (76%). Estimated in-situ degradation rates roughly varied within one order of magnitude for temperature changes between 5 degrees C and 20 degrees C. This study highlights that temporal variability in temperature and redox zonation is a significant factor for migration and degradation of nitrate and several OMPs. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Microbial reductive dechlorination of chlorinated aromatics frequently suffers from the long dechlorination period and the generation of toxic metabolites. Biocathode bioelectrochemical systems were verified to be effective in the degradation of various refractory pollutants. However, the electrochemical and microbial related working mechanisms for bio-dechlorination by electro-stimulation remain poorly understood. In this study, we reported the significantly improved 2,4,6-trichlorophenol dechlorination activity through the weak electro-stimulation (cathode potential of -0.36 V vs. SHE), as evidenced by the 3.1 times higher dechlorination rate and the complete dechlorination ability with phenol as the end dechlorination product. The high reductive dechlorination rate (20.8 mu M/d) could be maintained by utilizing electrode as an effective electron donor (coulombic efficiency of 82.3 +/- 4.8%). Cyclic voltammetry analysis of the cathodic biofilm gave the direct evidences of the cathodic respiration with the improved and positive-shifted reduction peaks of 2,4,6-TCP, 2,4-DCP and 4-CP. The optimal 2,4,6-TCP reductive dechlorination rate (24.2 mu M/d) was obtained when a small amount of lactate (2 mM) was added, and the generation of H-2 and CH4 were accompanied due to the biological fermentation and methanogenesis. The electrical stimulation significantly altered the cathodic biofilm structure and composition with some potential dechlorinators (like Acetobacterium) predominated. The microbial interactions in the ecological network of cathodic biofilm were more simplified than the planktonic community. However, some potential dechlorinators (Acetobacterium, Desulfovibrio, etc.) shared more positive interactions. The co-existence and possible cooperative relationships between potential dechlorinators and fermenters (Sedimentibacter, etc.) were revealed. Meanwhile, the competitive interrelations between potential dechlorinators and methanogens (Methanomassiliicoccus) were found. In the network of plankton, the fermenters and methanogens possessed the more positive interrelations. Electro-stimulation at the cathodic potential of -0.36 V selectively enhanced the dechlorination function, while it showed little influence on either fermentation or methanogenesis process. The study gave suggestions for the enhanced bioremediation of chlorinated aromatics, in views of the electrostimulation capacity, efficiency and microbial interrelations related microbial mechanism.

AB The sulfide-oxidizing autotrophic denitrification (SOAD) process offers a feasible alternative to mainstream heterotrophic denitrification in treating domestic sewage with insufficient organics. Previously SOAD has been successfully applied in a moving-bed biofilm reactor (MBBR). However, the biofilm properties and biokinetics are still not thoroughly understood. The present study was therefore designed to investigate these features of sulfur-oxidizing biofilms (SOBfs) cultivated in a lab-scale MBBR under stable operation for over a year. The biofilms developed were 160 mu m thick, had an uneven and porous surface on which elemental sulfur (S-0) accumulated, and the SOB biomass was highly diverse. The bioprocess kinetics were evaluated through 12 batch experiments. The results were interpreted by adopting a two-step sulfide oxidation model (sulfide (R) S-0 and S-0 (R) sulfate) with all specific rates having a linear regression coefficient of R-2 > 0.9. Moreover, the inhibitory kinetic analysis revealed that 1) the maximum treatment capacity (about 480 mg S/(m(2).h) and 80 mg N/(m(2).h)) was observed at low sulfide level (40 mg S/L), while higher sulfide level (60-150 mg S/L) showed increasing inhibition on the oxidation of both sulfide and sulfur and denitrification. 2) The denitritation activity decreased by up to 43% when free nitrous acid reached a maximum of 8.6 mu g N/L, whereas the oxidation of sulfide and sulfur did not have any significant effect. Interestingly, two physiologically diverse SOB groups were found in this special biofilm. The mechanisms of the cooperation and competition for electron donors and acceptors between these two SOB clades are proposed. The results of this study greatly enhance our understanding of the design and optimization of SOAD-MBBR for mainstream nitrogen removal. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Anammox granules are advantageous because of their relatively higher nitrogen removal rate (NRR) and biomass retention capacity in ammonia-containing wastewater treatment. However, little attention has been paid to granule rheological intensity and size evolution, especially under low temperature and substrate concentration conditions. In this study, the size evolution and variations in rheological properties associated with biochemical characteristics of anammox granules were investigated at decreasing temperatures (35 (R) 13 degrees C) and influent substrate concentrations (300 (R) 50 mg NH4+-N L-1). Both the specific anammox activities (SAA) and yield stress (tau(c)) (or storage modulus (G')), which reflected granules' intensity, decreased with decreasing temperature and influent substrate concentration. An exponential correlation was found between SAA and tau(c) (or G'). Granule size strongly decreased at low temperature (13 degrees C) and influent substrate concentration (50 mg NH4+-N L-1), despite slight variations in tau(c) (or G'). A threshold tau(c) (or G') that is closely related to the hydrodynamic shear force in the reactor may exist for the anammox granules. Once the tau(c) (or G') of the anammox granules was lower than this threshold value (tau(c)* = 10.13-15.63 kPa), granules that could not endure hydrodynamic shear forces would disintegrate and their size would decrease substantially. Candidatus Kuenenia was the dominant genus in the expanded granular sludge bed reactor, reaching a minimum abundance of 14.6% at 16 degrees C because of the low-temperature shock, but increasing in abundance to 57.0% at 13 degrees C, indicating it has a competitive advantage at low temperatures. This contributed to achieving a high reactor nitrogen loading rate (>1.0 kg N m(-3) d(-1)) even at 13 degrees C or with 50 mg NH4+-N L-1 influent. Overall, the results of this study will facilitate management of anammox bioreactors that run at various temperatures and influent substrate concentrations by clarifying the correlation between rheological intensity and anammox granule sludge activity and identifying the tau(c) (or G) threshold.

AB Anaerobic methane generation from algae is hindered by the slow and poor algae biodegradability. A novel free ammonia (NH3 i.e. FA) pretreatment technology was proposed in this work to enhance anaerobic methane generation from algae cultivated using a real secondary effluent. The algae solubilisation was 0.05-0.06 g SCOD/g TCOD (SCOD: soluble chemical oxygen demand; TCOD: total chemical oxygen demand) following FA pretreatment of 240-530 mg NH3-N/L for 24 h, whereas the solubilisation was only 0.01 g SCOD/g TCOD for the untreated algae. This indicates that FA pretreatment at 240-530 mg NH3-N/L could substantially enhance algae solubilisation. Biochemical methane potential tests revealed that FA pretreatment on algae at 240-530 mg NH3-N/L is able to significantly enhance anaerobic methane generation. The hydrolysis rate (k) and biochemical methane potential (P-0) of algae increased from 0.21 d(-1) and 132 L CH4/kg TCOD to 0.33-0.50 d(-1) and 140-154 L CH4/kg TCOD, respectively, after the algae was pretreated by FA at 240-530 mg NH3-N/L. Further analysis indicated that FA pretreatment improved k of both quickly and slowly biodegradable substrates, and also increased P-0 of the slowly biodegradable substrate although it negatively affected P0 of the quickly biodegradable substrate. This FA technology is a closed-loop technology. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Due to the climate change and human activity, the frequency and intensity of algal blooms have increased significantly. Recent studies have shown that during the bloom event, evaluated levels of cyanobacteria could infiltrate the drinking water treatment process and emerge in the filtered and disinfected water, thus threatening the safety of the drinking water supply. Among these concerned cyanobacteria, Microcystis aeruginosa is one of the most commonly detected species that cause algal bloom in a fresh water body. The present work was designed to investigate the transport and retention behaviour of Microcystis aeruginosa in a packed column to resolve the mechanisms that drive the transport behaviour of Microcystis under various operational conditions. The results showed that lab cultured Microcystis aeruginosa could effectively break through the packed column regardless of ionic strength, media size or flow rate, as well as the presence of dissolved organic matter in the water under the conditions investigated. Such behaviour significantly contradicts those of fluorescent microspheres, which are commonly considered as ideal colloids. In addition, the combined impacts of pre-oxidation technologies and filtration on Microcystis aeruginosa removal were tested systematically. It was found that even the cells have been lysed/oxidized, no significant improvement of cell removals were observed in packed column. This paper provides a significant and comprehensive record of transport and retention behaviour of Microcystis aeruginosa in porous media. The results found herein suggest that in addition to the effort preventing toxin release/exposure during bloom events in source water, engineers and researchers should also pay attention to the transport and retention of Microcystis aeruginosa and other algal cells in filters to minimize the risk of breakthrough of cyanobacteria cells in the drinking water treatment process.

AB Freshwater ecosystems can experience harmful algal blooms, which negatively impact recreational uses, aesthetics, taste, and odor in drinking water. Cyanobacterial toxins can have dire repercussions on aquatic wildlife and human health, and the most ubiquitous worldwide are the hepatotoxic compounds known as microcystins. The factors that influence the occurrence and magnitude of cyanobacteria blooms and toxin production vary in space and time and remain poorly understood. It is within this context that we present a suite of statistical models, parameterized with Bayesian inference techniques, to link the retrospective analysis of important environmental factors with the probability of exceedance of threshold microcystin levels. Our modelling framework is applied to the Bay of Quinte, Lake Ontario, Canada; a system with a long history of eutrophication problems. Collectively, 16.1% of the samples of the system collected during the study period (2003-2016) exceeded the drinking water guideline of 1.5 mu gL(-1), while approximately 3% of recorded values exceeded the recommended recreational threshold of 20 mu gL(-1). Using a segmented regression model with a stochastic breakpoint of microcystin concentrations estimated at 0.54 mu g L-1, we demonstrate that the environmental conditions associated with increased probability of exceedance of the drinking water standard are chlorophyll a concentration (3)(7) mu g L-1, water temperature (3)20 degrees C, ammonium concentration <= 40 mu gL(-1), total phosphorus concentration (3)25 mu g L-1, and wind speed <= 37 km h(-1). Considering the multitude of factors that can influence the ambient levels of toxins, our study argues that the adoption of probabilistic water quality criteria offers a pragmatic approach to accommodate the associated uncertainty by permitting a realistic frequency of violations. In this context, we present a framework to evaluate the confidence of compliance with probabilistic standards that stipulate less than 10% violations of microcystin threshold ambient levels.

AB Lindane (gamma-hexachlorocyclohexane) and its isomers (HCH) are some of the most common and most easily detected organochlorine pesticides in the environment. The widespread distribution of lindane is due to its use as an insecticide, accompanied by its persistence and bioaccumulation, whereas HCH were disposed of as waste in unmanaged landfills. Unfortunately, certain HCH (especially the most reactive ones: gamma- and alpha-HCH) are harmful to the central nervous system and to reproductive and endocrine systems, therefore development of suitable remediation methods is needed to remove them from contaminated soil and water. This paper provides a short history of the use of lindane and a description of the properties of HCH, as well as their determination methods. The main focus of the paper, however, is a review of oxidative and reductive treatment methods. Although these methods of HCH remediation are popular, there are no review papers summarising their principles, history, advantages and disadvantages. Furthermore, recent advances in the chemical treatment of HCH are discussed and risks concerning these processes are given. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB There is increasing public concern regarding the fate of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) during wastewater treatment, their persistence during the treatment process and their potential impacts on the receiving water bodies. In this study, we used quantitative PCR (qPCR) to determine the abundance of nine ARGs and a class 1 integron associated integrase gene in 16 wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluents from ten different European countries. In order to assess the impact on the receiving water bodies, gene abundances in the latter were also analysed.
   Six out of the nine ARGs analysed were detected in all effluent and river water samples. Among the quantified genes, intI1 and sul1 were the most abundant. Our results demonstrate that European WWTP contribute to the enrichment of the resistome in the receiving water bodies with the particular impact being dependent on the effluent load and local hydrological conditions. The ARGs concentrations in WWTP effluents were found to be inversely correlated to the number of implemented biological treatment steps, indicating a possible option for WWTP management.
   Furthermore, this study has identified bla(OXA-58) as a possible resistance gene for future studies investigating the impact of WWTPs on their receiving water. (C) 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Sidestream sludge treatment approaches have been developed in recent years to achieve mainstream nitrite shunt or partial nitritation, where NOB are selectively inactivated by biocidal factors such as free nitrous acid (FNA) or free ammonium (FA) in a sidestream reactor. The existence of NOB in raw wastewater has been increasingly realized and could pose critical challenge to stable NOB suppressions in those systems. This study, for the first time, evaluated the impact of influent NOB on the NOB suppressions in a mainstream nitrite shunt system achieved through sidestream sludge treatment. An over 500-day sequential batch reactor operation with six experimental phases rigorously demonstrated the negative effects of influent NOB on mainstream NOB control. Continuously seeding of NOB contained in influent stimulated NOB community shifts, leading to different extents of ineffective NOB suppression. The role of primary wastewater treatment in NOB removal from raw wastewater was also investigated. Results suggest primary settling and High Rate Activated Sludge system could remove a large part of NOB contained in raw wastewater. Primary treatment for raw wastewater is necessary for ensuring stable mainstream NOB suppressions. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

ID POLLUTANT TRANSPORT; SCHEMES; FLOWS
AB The mass transport processes always accompany the flow phenomena and have attracted many researchers. A lot of numerical methods have been developed to study them. These numerical methods can be classified into the Eulerian and the Lagrangian approaches. The Lagrangian approach has advantages in high stability and simplicity over the Eulerian approach, but suffers from heavy computational cost. In this paper, we are mainly concerned with the trade-offs between the accuracy and computational cost when applying the random walk method, which is a Lagrangian approach for examining the mass transport scenario. We introduce a linear model to assess the accuracy of the random walk method in several computational configurations. Studies on computational parameters, i.e. the size of time step and number of particles, are conducted with the focus on estimation of the longitudinal dispersion coefficient D-L in steady flows. The results show that the proposed linear model can satisfactorily explain the computational accuracy, both in sample and out-of-sample. Furthermore, we find a constant dimensionless parameter, which quantifies a generic relationship between the accuracy and the number of particles regardless of the flow and diffusion conditions. This dimensionless parameter is of theoretic value and offers guidelines for choosing the correct computational parameters to achieve the required numerical accuracy. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) are an effective barrier in the protection of human and environment health around the world, although WWTPs also are suggested to be selectors and-or reservoirs of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) before entering the environment. The dogma about WWTPs as "ARG selectors" presumes that biotreatment compartments (e.g., activated sludge; AS) are single densely populated ecosystems with elevated horizontal gene transfer. However, recent work has suggested WWTP biotreatment compartments may be different than previously believed relative to antibiotic resistance (AR) fate, and other process factors, such as bacterial separation and specific waste sources, may be key to ARGs released to the environment. Here we combined 16S rRNA metagenomic sequencing and high-throughput qPCR to characterise microbial communities and ARGs across a wastewater network in Spain that includes both community (i.e., non-clinical urban) and hospital sources. Contrary to expectations, ARGs found in downstream receiving waters were not dominated by AS biosolids (RAS), but more resembled raw wastewater sources. In fact, ARGs and microbial communities in liquid-phase WWTP effluents and RAS were significantly different (Bray-Curtis dissimilarity index = 0.66 +/- 0.11), with a consequential fraction of influent ARGs and organisms passing directly through the WWTP with limited association with RAS. Instead, ARGs and organisms in the RAS may be more defined by biosolids separation and biophysical traits, such as flocculation, rather than ARG carriage. This explains why RAS has significantly lower ARG richness (47 +/- 4 ARGs) than liquid-phase effluents (104 +/- 5 ARGs), and downstream water column (135 +/- 4 ARGs) and river sediments (120 +/- 5 ARGs) (Tukey's test, p < 0.001). These data suggest RAS and liquid-phase WWTP effluents may reflect two parallel ecosystems with potentially limited ARG exchange. As such, ARG mitigation in WWTPs should more focus on removing bacterial hosts from the liquid phase, AR source reduction, and possibly disinfection to reduce ARG releases to the environment.

AB Practical application of metallurgical microbial electrolysis cells (MECs) requires efficient removal of metals and organics in larger reactors. A 40 L cylindrical single-chamber MEC fed acetate was used to achieve high removals of W(VI) and Mo(VI). In the presence of both metals, there were nearly complete removals of W (97 - 98%), Mo (98 - 99%), and acetate (95 - 96%), along with a low level of hydrogen production (0.0037-0.0039 L/L/d) at a hydraulic residence time (HRT) of 2 d (influent ratios of W:Mo:acetate of 0.5:1.0:24 mM). The final concentrations of these conditions were sufficient to meet national wastewater discharge standards. In the controls with individual metals or acetate, lower contaminant removals were obtained (W, 2 -4%; Mo, 3 - 5%, acetate, 36 - 39%). Metals removal in all cases was primarily due to the biocathodes rather than the bioanodes. The presence of metals decreased microbial diversity on the anodes and increased diversity on the cathodes, based on analysis at the phylum, class and genus levels, as a function of HRT and influent concentration. This study demonstrated the feasibility of larger-scale single-chamber MECs for efficient treatment of W and Mo, moving metallurgical MECs closer to commercialization for wastewater treatment of these two metals.

AB The global energy crisis and water pollution drive the researchers to develop highly effective and less energy intensive water purification technologies. In this study, a highly active WO3@TiO2-SiO2 nanocomposite was synthesized and used for photocatalytic degradation of persistent organic pollutants under simulated solar light. The optimum WO3@TiO2-SiO2 prepared with 2 wt% WO3 loading and calcination at 800 degrees C exhibited higher photocatalytic activity, as the rate constant (k1) for phenanthrene degradation was similar to 7.1 times of that for the commercial TiO2 (P25). The extremely large specific surface area (>400 m2/g) of WO3@TiO2-SiO2 afforded it with enlarged pollutants adsorption performance and abundant active surface sites. The heterojunction of anatase with SiO2 as well as loading of WO3 decreased the band gap energy (Eg) of TiO2, which extended the utilization spectrum of TiO2 to visible region. Formation of Ti-O-Si band indicated the excess charges can cause Bronsted acidity due to the absorption of protons to compensate the charges. Moreover, the migration of photo-excited electrons from the conduction band of anatase to WO3 and holes in the opposite direction restrained the electron-hole recombination. The photocatalytic degradation mechanism and pathway for phenanthrene degradation were proposed based on experimental analysis and density functional theory (DFT) calculation, and the toxicities of the degradation intermediates were evaluated by quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) analysis. WO3@TiO2-SiO2 also showed good separation (settling) performance and high stability. Our work is expected to offer new insight into the photocatalytic mechanism for WO3, TiO2 and SiO2 based heterojunctions, and rational design and synthesis of highly efficient photocatalysts for environmental application.

AB This work investigates the potential of the combination of peroxymonosulfate (PMS) and simulated solar radiation (lambda > 300 nm) to remove bezafibrate from aqueous solution. Different solar light filters indicate a higher removal efficiency as the wavelength range used moves to the more energetic region of the solar spectrum. The system PMS/Daylight (300-800 nm) eliminates bezafibrate (1 mg L-1) in less than 30 min under the best conditions used in this study (C-PMS = 4.10(-4) M) with no pH control (acidic pH). The efficiency of the process significantly improves under alkaline conditions (pH = 10), likely due to a higher PMS photolysis rate. Experiments conducted at different initial concentration of PMS and bezafibrate suggest first order regarding PMS and different from 1 in the case of bezafibrate. Intermediates generated at the beginning of the process have been tentatively identified to propose a hypothetical reaction pathway and to estimate their toxicity.(C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The performance of conventional drinking water treatment plants (WTPs) can be improved using quantitative microbial risk assessment (QMRA). A QMRA study on Cryptosporidium using actual pathogen density was conducted to examine the performance of Jalaliyeh WTP in Tehran, Iran. The infection risk and the burden of disease attributed to the parasite presence in finished water were estimated incorporating physical and chemical log reduction values (LRVs), using stochastic modeling and disinfection profiling. The risk and burden of disease were compared with health-based targets, i.e. one case of infection per 10,000 people or 10(-6) DALYs per person per year. The parasite's LRVs were 2.31 and 0.034 log provided by physico-chemical treatment and disinfection processes, respectively. The mean of estimated risk (111 cases per 10(4) people per year) and the burden of disease (11.7 DALYs per 10(6) people per year) both exceeded the targets. To control the excess risk, three QMRA-based disinfection scenarios were examined including: (1) employing chlorine dioxide (ClO2) instead of chlorine (2) ozonation with a concentration of 0.75 mg/L (Ct = 22.5 min mg/L) and (3) UV irradiation with a dose of 10 mJ/cm(2). The LRV of parasite may be increased to 3.0, 5.1 and 4.9 log by employing ClO2, ozonation and UV irradiation, respectively. The use of ozone or UV as alternative disinfectants, could enhance the disinfection efficacy and provide sufficient additional treatment against the excess risk of parasite. QMRA could make it easier applying appropriate improvement to conventional WTPs in order to increase the system performance in terms of health-based measures. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The pyrolysis kinetics of sewage sludge was studied to determine the constituent of sludge and explore the feasibility of pyrolytic post-treatment. Both flocculent sludge and granular sludge were pyrolysed in a thermogravimetric analyser under inert atmospheric conditions. The pyrolysis of granular sludge and flocculent sludge were described by three parallel reactions model with three individual pseudo-components. The decomposition activation energy values of the three pseudo-components were determined by iso-conversional methods to be 263.97 kJ/mol, 257.18 kJ/mol and 153.61 kJ/mol in flocculent sludge and 139.89 kJ/mol, 228.78 kJ/mol and 142.78 kJ/mol in granular sludge, respectively. Granular sludge exhibited better thermal stability but lower devolatilisation activation energy than flocculent sludge, which could be attributed by enriched alkali and alkaline metals during granulation. Master plots of experimental data sets suggested that the decomposition of all organic pseudo-components of flocculent sludge followed the nth-order mechanism while the pyrolytic mechanism of the first organic fraction in granular sludge coincided with random nucleation and nuclei growth. By investigating the pyrolytic behaviour, this study sheds light on the composition of granular sludge and the impact of sludge components on granular sludge pyrolysis, and lays the foundation for the treatment of waste granular sludge with potential for resource and energy recovery in the near future.

AB Coupling anaerobic digestion and algae cultivation has attracted attention as a sustainable means of treating high-strength wastewaters. In such a scenario, nutrients from the liquid anaerobic digestate are used by algae to produce biomass. However, use of full-strength digestate results in poor algal growth and nutrient removal. Most researchers have overcome this challenge by diluting digestate 10-30 fold prior to algae growth but such dilution rates demand large amounts of fresh water, posing challenges for scale-up. The objectives of this study were to 1) assess whether ammonium, turbidity, and heavy metals in digestate were the primary sources of inhibition for a highly-nutrient tolerant strain of Chlorella sorokiniana, and, 2) develop a biological pretreatment strategy to overcome algal growth inhibition on full strength digestate. Ammonia toxicity, turbidity, and heavy metals have been commonly hypothesized as the source of algal growth inhibition, but our results showed that these factors were not critical inhibitors of C. sorokiniana. Dose response studies showed that C. sorokiniana could grow robustly on 3,500 mg/L ammonium. Regardless, full strength digestates of wastewater sludge and food waste were very inhibitory to C. sorokiniana. We utilized a pretreatment approach using activated sludge which led to robust algal growth on full-strength digestate. High growth rates of 250-500 mg/L/d were achievable on pretreated digestates despite very high ammonium levels of similar to 2,000 mg/L. Pretreating digestate also led to significantly faster algal nutrient uptake compared to untreated digestate (p < 0.001). (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Certain amino acids (AAs) can form odorous aldehydes, nitriles and N-chloroaldimines during chlorination. Ultraviolet (UV) photolysis, ultraviolet/persulfate (UV/PS) and ultraviolet/hydrogen peroxide (UV/H2O2) treatments have been reported to decrease trace organic contaminants in drinking water. In this study, 20 common AAs in East Taihu (ET) Lake (the main drinking water source for the surrounding cities) were determined during one year (four seasons). The impacts of UV photolysis alone and two UV-advanced oxidation process (AOP) pre-treatments on the formation of aldehydes, nitriles and N-chloroaldimines during post-chlorination of water containing three of the most detected AAs (i.e. valine (Val), leucine (Leu) and isoleucine (Ile)) in ET Lake were investigated. Results showed that the two UV-AOPs significantly decreased the odorous by-product formation from AAs compared with UV photolysis alone. The formation of N-chloroaldimines was more easily controlled than that of aldehyde and nitrile. Furthermore, UV/H2O2 was more effective than UV/PS at pH = 5 and 7. At pH = 9, the two UV-AOPs had similar effects and did not perform very well. In addition, the UV-AOPs controlled the formation of odorous by-products effectively at Cl/AA (molar ratio of chlorine to amino acid) ratios of 2.4 and 3.0 but increased their formation at Cl/AA ratios of 0.8 and 1.2. Experiments in real water showed that UV/H2O2 was more suitable for controlling the off-flavor problem caused by chlorination of AAs in ET Lake. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Antibiotic resistance is an emerging global health crisis, driven largely by overuse and misuse of antibiotics. However, there are examples in which the production of these antimicrobial agents has polluted the environment with active antibiotic residues, selecting for antibiotic resistant bacteria and the genes they carry. In this work, we have used shotgun metagenomics to investigate the taxonomic structure and resistance gene composition of sludge communities in a treatment plant in Croatia receiving wastewater from production of the macrolide antibiotic azithromycin. We found that the total abundance of antibiotic resistance genes was three times higher in sludge from the treatment plant receiving wastewater from pharmaceutical production than in municipal sludge from a sewage treatment plant in Zagreb. Surprisingly, macrolide resistance genes did not have higher abundances in the industrial sludge, but genes associated with mobile genetic elements such as integrons had. We conclude that at high concentrations of antibiotics, selection may favor taxonomic shifts towards intrinsically resistant species or strains harboring chromosomal resistance mutations rather than acquisition of mobile resistance determinants. Our results underscore the need for regulatory action also within Europe to avoid release of antibiotics into the environment. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The objective of this study was to implement electrochemical advanced oxidation processes (EAOPs) for mineralization and biodegradability enhancement of nanofiltration (NF) concentrate from landfill leachate initially pre-treated in a membrane bioreactor (MBR). Raw carbon felt (CF) or (FeFeIII)-Fe-II layered double hydroxides-modified CF were used for comparing the efficiency of homogeneous and heterogeneous electro-Fenton (EF), respectively. The highest mineralization rate was obtained by heterogeneous EF: 96% removal of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) was achieved after 8 h of electrolysis at circumneutral initial pH (pH(0) = 7.9) and at 8.3 mA cm(-2). However, the most efficient treatment strategy appeared to be heterogeneous EF at 4.2 mA cm(-2) combined with anodic oxidation using Ti4O7 anode (energy consumption = 0.11 kWh g(-1) of DOC removed). Respirometric analyses under similar conditions than in the real MBR emphasized the possibility to recirculate the NF retentate towards the MBR after partial mineralization by EAOPs in order to remove the residual biodegradable by-products and improve the global cost effectiveness of the process. Further analyses were also performed in order to better understand the fate of organic and inorganic species during the treatment, including acute toxicity tests (Microtox (R)), characterization of dissolved organic matter by three-dimensional fluorescence spectroscopy, evolution of inorganic ions (ClO3-, NH4+ and NO3-) and identification/quantification of degradation by-products such as carboxylic acids. The obtained results emphasized the interdependence between the MBR process and EAOPs in a combined treatment strategy. Improving the retention in the MBR of colloidal proteins would improve the effectiveness of EAOPs because such compounds were identified as the most refractory. Enhanced nitrification would be also required in the MBR because of the release of NH4+ from mineralization of refractory organic nitrogen during EAOPs. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Although infectious disease risk from recreational exposure to waterborne pathogens has been an active area of research for decades, beach sand is a relatively unexplored habitat for the persistence of pathogens and fecal indicator bacteria (FIB). Beach sand, biofilms, and water all present unique advantages and challenges to pathogen introduction, growth, and persistence. These dynamics are further complicated by continuous exchange between sand and water habitats. Models of FIB and pathogen fate and transport at beaches can help predict the risk of infectious disease from beach use, but knowledge gaps with respect to decay and growth rates of pathogens in beach habitats impede robust modeling. Climatic variability adds further complexity to predictive modeling because extreme weather events, warming water, and sea level change may increase human exposure to waterborne pathogens and alter relationships between FIB and pathogens. In addition, population growth and urbanization will exacerbate contamination events and increase the potential for human exposure. The cumulative effects of anthropogenic changes will alter microbial population dynamics in beach habitats and the assumptions and relationships used in quantitative microbial risk assessment (QMRA) and process-based models. Here, we review our current understanding of microbial populations and transport dynamics across the sand-water continuum at beaches, how these dynamics can be modeled, and how global change factors (e.g., climate and land use) should be integrated into more accurate beachscape-based models.

AB Mixing oxidant of chlorine dioxide (ClO2) and chlorine (Cl-2) often applied in water disinfection. Two secondary wastewater effluents at different ammonium-N levels (0.1 and 1.6 mg N L-1) were treated with the mixing oxidant (ClO2/Cl-2) to evaluate the formation of disinfection byproducts (DBPs) and the associated cytotoxicity of treated wastewaters. The total chlorine concentrations of ClO2 and Cl-2 were maintained at 10 mg L-1 as Cl-2 with varied mixing ratios of ClO2 to Cl-2. The formation of 37 halogenated DBPs, including nitrogenous, brominated and iodinated analogues, and 2 inorganic DBPs (chlorite and chlorate) was examined. The sum concentrations of the halogenated DBPs were reduced remarkably with decreasing Cl-2 percentages, but each individual DBP group had distinct features. The regulated trihalomethanes reduced the most when ClO2 was present in chlorination, but decreasing Cl-2 percentage from 70% to 30% was not quite effective to reduce the formation of iodinated trihalomethanes, haloacetic acids and haloacetontriles in low ammonium-N wastewater. The bromine and iodine substitution factors tend to increase with decreasing Cl-2 percentages, indicating that destruction of DBP precursors by ClO2 favored bromine and iodine incorporation. Additionally, decreasing Cl-2 percentages in the mixing oxidant (ClO2/Cl-2) was often accompanied with lower chlorate formation but higher chlorite formation. The toxicity of treated wastewaters was evaluated through two approaches: the calculated cytotoxicity based on the concentrations of detected DBPs and the experimental cytotoxicity using the Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. The calculated cytotoxicity decreased with decreasing Cl-2 percentages, with haloacetonitriles and haloacetaldehydes as predominate contributors. However, the experimental cytotoxicity tests showed that treatment of high ammonium-N wastewater with ClO2/Cl-2 exhibited considerable higher (> 3 times) cytotoxicity potency than using single disinfectant.

AB The ability of lateral flow sand filters, used as on-site wastewater treatment systems (OWTS), to remove antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs), antibiotic resistant bacteria (ARB), and other relevant genetic markers (HF183, 16S rRNA, and int1) was assessed. Municipal wastewater was settled in a septic tank prior to loading into six pilot-scale lateral flow sand filters comprised of three different sand media types, at 5 and 30% slopes. The sand filters were sampled bi-weekly for: 9 ARGs and 3 other complimentary gene markers (sul1, sul2, qnrS, tetO, ermB, bla(TEM), bla(CTX-M), mecA, vanA, int1, HF183, 16S rRNA), and conventional microbial and water quality indicators, from July to November in 2017, and four times in the summer of 2018. The sand filters were observed to attenuate 7 of the ARGs to mostly below 2 log gene copies per mL. Log reductions ranging from 2.9 to 5.4 log were observed for the removal of absolute abundances of ARGs from septic tank effluent in 5 of the 6 sand filters. The fine-grained filter on the 5% slope did not perform as well for ARG attenuation due to hydraulic failure. The apportionment of cell-associated versus cell-free DNA was determined for the gene markers and this indicated that the genes were primarily carried intracellularly. Average log reductions of ARB with resistance to either sulfamethoxazole, erythromycin, or tetracycline were approximately 2.3 log CFU per mL within the filters compared to the septic tank effluent. This field study provides in-depth insights into the attenuation of ARB, ARGs, and their genetic compartmentalization in variably saturated sand OWTS. Overall, this type of OWTS was found to pose little risk of antimicrobial resistance contamination spread into surrounding environments when proper hydraulic function was maintained.

AB Epidemiological studies have consistently associated the consumption of chlorinated drinking water with an enhanced risk of bladder cancer. While this suggests that some disinfection byproducts (DBPs) are bladder carcinogens, causal agents are unknown. This study aims to highlight likely candidates. To achieve this, structures of known and hypothesised DBPs were compared with 76 known bladder carcinogens. The latter are dominated by nitrogenous and aromatic compounds; only 10 are halogenated. Under 10% of the chlorine applied during drinking water treatment is converted into identified halogenated byproducts; most of the chlorine is likely to be consumed during the generation of unidentified non-halogenated oxidation products. Six nitrosamines are among the nine most potent bladder carcinogens, and two of them are known to be DBPs: N-nitrosodiphenylamine and nitrosodibutylamine. However, these and other nitrosamines are formed in insufficiently low concentrations in chlorinated drinking water to account for the observed bladder cancer risk. Furthermore, although not proven bladder carcinogens, certain amines, haloamides, halocyclopentenoic acids, furans and haloquinones are potential candidates. At present, most identified bladder carcinogens are nitrogenous, whereas >90% of natural organic matter is not. Therefore, non-nitrogenous DBPs are likely to contribute to the bladder cancer risk. Given the high proportion of DBPs that remains uncharacterised, it is important that future research prioritises compounds believed to be potent toxicants. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Water scarcity has become a global issue that has forced many communities to seek alternative water resources. The majority of water on the earth's surface comes from the sea. Seawater has the potential to mitigate water stress after proper treatment. In Hong Kong, seawater has been used directly for toilet flushing for more than 50 years and the seawater toilet flushing (SWTF) system serves 80% of the residents. However, its environmental feasibility remains unknown. This study is a pioneer evaluating the environmental performances of the SWTF system by comparing SWTF with other alternative water resources including desalinated seawater, desalinated wastewater effluent, centralized wastewater reclamation and on-site greywater reclamation systems, while the conventional long-distance imported water scenario is set as the baseline for comparison. This evaluation is first conducted in the Southern District and North New Territory in Hong Kong, demonstrating SWTF is significantly more environmentally-friendly than other alternative water resources, which is the only alternative water resource application approach with environmental impacts comparable with the conventional long-distance imported water scenario. On the contrary, other alternative water resources application approaches would result in additional environmental impacts. Seaside distances and effective population density are two major geographical impact factors effecting the environmental impacts of different water systems in these two districts. The benefits obtained from SWTF in fourteen cities in South China are further investigated. It is confirmed that SWTF can significantly relieve water stress with the lowest environmental impacts comparing with other alternative options in these cities if alternative water resources must be applied for domestic usage. However, the assessment from different aspects should be further conducted to compare these alternative water resources. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Microplastics in food is a relatively new research field with only few studies available so far. Scientists have been pointing out that some of these studies apply questionable analytical methods. Nevertheless, media often use such results to gain attention of the readers. It is therefore of particular significance, that only those scientific studies are published, clearly presenting valid data on the content of microplastics in food. Unfortunately, the study by Zuccarello et al. shows very critical aspects regarding analytical methods used and conclusions made. The applied procedure is not described and, therefore, does not allow any assessment by other groups, which is indispensable prerequisite of any scientific publication. Moreover, the analytical method used for the identification and quantification of microplastic particles SEM-EDX is not sound and not validated. Therefore, in our opinion the results on the contamination of bottled mineral water with microplastics published by Zuccarello et al. are more than questionable. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Hydrophilic organic micropollutants are commonly detected in source water used for drinking water production. Effective technologies to remove these micropollutants from water include adsorption onto granular activated carbon in fixed-bed filters. The rate-determining step in adsorption using activated carbon is usually the adsorbate diffusion inside the porous adsorbent. The presence of mesopores can facilitate diffusion, resulting in higher adsorption rates. We used two different types of granular activated carbon, with and without mesopores, to study the adsorption rate of hydrophilic micropollutants. Furthermore, equilibrium studies were performed to determine the affinity of the selected micro pollutants for the activated carbons. A pore diffusion model was applied to the kinetic data to obtain pore diffusion coefficients. We observed that the adsorption rate is influenced by the molecular size of the micropollutant as well as the granular activated carbon pore size. (C) 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB A novel approach for treating vaporization of liquid droplets with large deformation and high mass transfer rate is developed. The formulation is based on decomposed vaporization mechanisms and accommodates the effects of density and property variations in both the gas and liquid phases. In this model, the mass and energy transfer across the interface are realized by a source layer in the gas phase and a sink layer in the liquid phase around the interface. The flow field in each phase is described by a set of unified conservation equations in the low Mach number limit. The equations are then solved by a modified projection method, in which the nonzero velocity divergence is treated as a source term in the pressure Poisson equation. The vaporization model is implemented in a volume-of-fluid (VOF) based code "Gerris" featuring adaptive mesh refinement. The vaporization of a single n-decane droplet in both quiescent and convective air environments of 1000 K at 1 atm is investigated to verify and validate the present model in terms of interface localization and mass conservation. The results demonstrate the accuracy and robustness of the present work. The vaporization of an impulsively started n-decane droplet with large deformation and breakup is also studied. The droplet surface dynamics are captured well, as are the vaporization behaviors. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB This study aims to extend the original Eulerian space-time conservation element and solution element (CE/SE) method to the Eulerian-Lagrangian framework to solve the gas-particle two-phase detonation problems. The gas-aluminum particle two-phase detonations are numerically investigated by the developed Eulerian-Lagrangian code, in which the gas-phase compressible Euler equations are solved by our in-house CE/SE scheme based on quadrilateral meshes. Additionally, the particle-phase Lagrangian equations, together with the stiff source terms of interphase interactions and chemical reactions, are explicitly integrated via the operator-splitting technique. A dynamic data structure is introduced to store particle information to overcome the tremendous communication costs when applying message passing interface parallel to the Eulerian-Lagrangian framework. The code is shown to be of better parallel efficiency in moderate-scale computations than that uses static arrays. Comparisons with previous one-dimensional and two-dimensional simulation results and experimental observations are conducted to demonstrate the accuracy and reliability of the developed Eulerian-Lagrangian CE/SE code in gas-particle two-phase detonation simulations. Moreover, the code is also applied to simulate polydisperse gas-particle detonations which is close to a realistic scenario, and significant differences in detonation characteristics are found when compared with the monodisperse counterparts. The great demands of using the Eulerian-Lagrangian method to obtain more physics-consistent gas-particle detonation results are addressed, which the traditional Eulerian-Eulerian simulations fail to observe.

AB In this paper, the probability density functions (PDFs) of scalar stochastic differential equations (SDEs) subject to alpha-stable Levy white noise are investigated. The path integral (PI) method is extended to solve one-dimensional space fractional Fokker-Planck-Kolmogorov (FPK) equations, which are the governing equations corresponded to scalar SDEs excited by alpha-stable Levy white noise. First, we derive a short time solution of the one-dimensional space fractional FPK equation, which is used in the Chapman-Kolmogorov-Smoluchowski (CKS) equation to obtain the PI solution. Then, the accuracy of the PI solution is analyzed theoretically in terms of its characteristic function. Our results demonstrate that the PI method has a higher accuracy than the first order finite difference method for one step iteration in time. Finally, several illustrative examples are carried out in detail to verify the feasibility and effectiveness of the PI method for solving one-dimensional space fractional FPK equations. We find that the PI solution agrees well with the exact solution or the Monte Carlo one. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Surrogate modeling and uncertainty quantification tasks for PDE systems are most often considered as supervised learning problems where input and output data pairs are used for training. The construction of such emulators is by definition a small data problem which poses challenges to deep learning approaches that have been developed to operate in the big data regime. Even in cases where such models have been shown to have good predictive capability in high dimensions, they fail to address constraints in the data implied by the PDE model. This paper provides a methodology that incorporates the governing equations of the physical model in the loss/likelihood functions. The resulting physics-constrained, deep learning models are trained without any labeled data (e.g. employing only input data) and provide comparable predictive responses with data-driven models while obeying the constraints of the problem at hand. This work employs a convolutional encoder-decoder neural network approach as well as a conditional flow-based generative model for the solution of PDEs, surrogate model construction, and uncertainty quantification tasks. The methodology is posed as a minimization problem of the reverse Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between the model predictive density and the reference conditional density, where the later is defined as the Boltzmann-Gibbs distribution at a given inverse temperature with the underlying potential relating to the PDE system of interest. The generalization capability of these models to out-of-distribution input is considered. Quantification and interpretation of the predictive uncertainty is provided for a number of problems.

AB A thermal lattice Boltzmann model with a hybrid recursive regularization (HRR) collision operator is developed on standard lattices for simulation of subsonic and sonic compressible flows without shock. The approach is hybrid: mass and momentum conservation equations are solved using a lattice Boltzmann solver, while the energy conservation is solved under entropy form with a finite volume solver. The defect of Galilean invariance related to Mach number is corrected by the third order equilibrium distribution function, supplemented by an additional correcting term and hybrid recursive regularization. The proposed approach is assessed considering the simulation of i) an isentropic vortex convection, ii) a two dimensional acoustic pulse and iii) non-isothermal Gaussian pulse with Ma number in range of 0 to 1. Numerical simulations demonstrate that the flaw in Galilean invariance is effectively eliminated by the compressible HRR model. At last, the compressible laminar flows over flat plate at Ma number of 0.3 and 0.87, Reynolds number of 10(5) are considered to validate the capture of viscous and diffusive effects.

AB In this paper, we consider Maxwell's equations in linear dispersive media described by a single-pole Lorentz model for electronic polarization. We study two classes of commonly used spatial discretizations: finite difference methods (FD) with arbitrary even order accuracy in space and high spatial order discontinuous Galerkin (DG) finite element methods. Both types of spatial discretizations are coupled with second order semi-implicit leap-frog and implicit trapezoidal temporal schemes. By performing detailed dispersion analysis for the semi-discrete and fully discrete schemes, we obtain rigorous quantification of the dispersion error for Lorentz dispersive dielectrics. In particular, comparisons of dispersion error can be made taking into account the model parameters, and mesh sizes in the design of the two types of schemes. This work is a continuation of our previous research on energy-stable numerical schemes for nonlinear dispersive optical media [6,7]. The results for the numerical dispersion analysis of the reduced linear model, considered in the present paper, can guide us in the optimal choice of discretization parameters for the more complicated and nonlinear models. The numerical dispersion analysis of the fully discrete FD and DG schemes, for the dispersive Maxwell model considered in this paper, clearly indicate the dependence of the numerical dispersion errors on spatial and temporal discretizations, their order of accuracy, mesh discretization parameters and model parameters. The results obtained here cannot be arrived at by considering discretizations of Maxwell's equations in free space. In particular, our results contrast the advantages and disadvantages of using high order FD or DG schemes and leap-frog or trapezoidal time integrators over different frequency ranges using a variety of measures of numerical dispersion errors. Finally, we highlight the limitations of the second order accurate temporal discretizations considered. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB We present a deep learning framework for quantifying and propagating uncertainty in systems governed by non-linear differential equations using physics-informed neural networks. Specifically, we employ latent variable models to construct probabilistic representations for the system states, and put forth an adversarial inference procedure for training them on data, while constraining their predictions to satisfy given physical laws expressed by partial differential equations. Such physics-informed constraints provide a regularization mechanism for effectively training deep generative models as surrogates of physical systems in which the cost of data acquisition is high, and training data-sets are typically small. This provides a flexible framework for characterizing uncertainty in the outputs of physical systems due to randomness in their inputs or noise in their observations that entirely bypasses the need for repeatedly sampling expensive experiments or numerical simulators. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through a series of examples involving uncertainty propagation in non-linear conservation laws, and the discovery of constitutive laws for flow through porous media directly from noisy data.

AB In the past two decades, researchers have made remarkable progress in accelerating flash calculation, which is very useful in a variety of engineering processes. In this paper, general phase splitting problem statements and flash calculation procedures using the Successive Substitution Method are reviewed, while the main shortages are pointed out. Two acceleration methods, Newton's method and the Sparse Grids Method are presented afterwards as a comparison with the deep learning model proposed in this paper. A detailed introduction from artificial neural networks to deep learning methods is provided here with the authors' own remarks. Factors in the deep learning model are investigated to show their effect on the final result. A selected model based on that has been used in a flash calculation predictor with comparison with other methods mentioned above. It is shown that results from the optimized deep learning model meet the experimental data well with the shortest CPU time. More comparison with experimental data has been conducted to show the robustness of our model. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI On the integration of the SPH equations for a highly viscous fluid
SO JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL PHYSICS

DT Article
DE Smoothed particle hydrodynamics; Highly viscous
AB This paper shows how the combination of Strang splitting and the exact integration of SPH pair-wise viscous interactions, enables highly viscous flows such as lava or magma, to be integrated efficiently, even when the typical time scale of the dissipation terms is much less than the time scale arising from other constraints such as the Courant condition. We first apply the algorithm to the simulation of a planar Couette flow in two dimensions and find it is stable up to the highest viscosity coefficient used which, in SI units is mu = 10(5) which is equivalent to 10(8) times the viscosity of water. The accuracy is excellent up to mu = 800 but for larger values of mu the errors are larger until the flow is close to the final state. The second application is to the two dimensional flow of a viscous fluid under gravity over a rigid surface and with a free upper surface. The agreement with the similarity solution of Huppert (1982) [3] is very satisfactory even when the time step is similar to 600 times the stable time step for an explicit integration.

ID MESHLESS METHODS; LINEAR-SYSTEMS; APPROXIMATION
AB In this paper, we develop regularized discrete least squares collocation and finite volume methods for solving two-dimensional nonlinear time-dependent partial differential equations on irregular domains. The solution is approximated using tensor product cubic spline basis functions defined on a background rectangular (interpolation) mesh, which leads to high spatial accuracy and straightforward implementation, and establishes a solid base for extending the computational framework to three-dimensional problems. A semi-implicit time-stepping method is employed to transform the nonlinear partial differential equation into a linear boundary value problem. A key finding of our study is that the newly proposed mesh-free finite volume method based on circular control volumes reduces to the collocation method as the radius limits to zero. Both methods produce a large constrained least-squares problem that must be solved at each time step in the advancement of the solution. We have found that regularization yields a relatively well-conditioned system that can be solved accurately using QR factorization. An extensive numerical investigation is performed to illustrate the effectiveness of the present methods, including the application of the new method to a coupled system of time-fractional partial differential equations having different fractional indices in different (irregularly shaped) regions of the solution domain.

AB For an accurate description of electromagneto-thermomechanical systems, electromagnetic fields need to be described in a EULERian frame, whereby the thermomechanics is solved in a LAGRANGEan frame. It is possible to map the EULERian frame to the current placement of the matter and the LAGRANGEan frame to a reference placement. We present a rigorous and thermodynamically consistent derivation of governing equations for fully coupled electromagneto-thermomechanical systems properly handling finite deformations. A clear separation of the different frames is necessary. There are various attempts to formulate electromagnetism in the LAGRANGEan frame, or even to compute all fields in the current placement. Both formulations are challenging and heavily discussed in the literature. In this work, we propose another solution scheme that exploits the capabilities of advanced computational tools. Instead of amending the formulation, we can solve thermomechanics in the LAGRANGEan frame and electromagnetism in the EULERian frame and manage the interaction between the fields. The approach is similar to its analog in fluid structure interaction, but more challenging because the field equations in electromagnetism must also be solved within the solid body while following their own different set of transformation rules. We additionally present a mesh-morphing algorithm necessary to accommodate finite deformations to solve the electromagnetic fields outside of the material body. We illustrate the use of the new formulation by developing an opensource implementation using the FEniCS package and applying this implementation to several engineering problems in electromagnetic structure interaction undergoing large deformations.

AB Steady-state pair correlations between inelastic granular beads in a vertically shaken, quasi two-dimensional cell can be mapped onto the particle correlations in a truly two-dimensional reference fluid in thermodynamic equilibrium. Using Granular Dynamics simulations and Iterative Ornstein-Zernike Inversion, we demonstrate that this mapping applies in a wide range of particle packing fractions and restitution coefficients, and that the conservative reference particle interactions are simpler than it has been reported earlier. The effective potential appears to be a smooth, concave function of the particle distance r. At low packing fraction, the shape of the effective potential is compatible with a one-parametric fit function proportional to r(-2). (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB In this work, we develop a new class of numerical schemes for collisional kinetic equations in the diffusive regime. The first step consists in reformulating the problem by decomposing the solution in the time evolution of an equilibrium state plus a perturbation. Then, the scheme combines a Monte Carlo solver for the perturbation with an Eulerian method for the equilibrium part, and is designed in such a way to be uniformly stable with respect to the diffusive scaling and to be consistent with the asymptotic diffusion equation. Moreover, since particles are only used to describe the perturbation part of the solution, the scheme becomes computationally less expensive - and is thus an asymptotically complexity diminishing scheme (ACDS) - as the solution approaches the equilibrium state due to the fact that the number of particles diminishes accordingly. This contrasts with standard methods for kinetic equations where the computational cost increases (or at least does not decrease) with the number of interactions. At the same time, the statistical error due to the Monte Carlo part of the solution decreases as the system approaches the equilibrium state: the method automatically degenerates to a solution of the macroscopic diffusion equation in the limit of infinite number of interactions. After a detailed description of the method, we perform several numerical tests and compare this new approach with classical numerical methods on various problems up to the full three dimensional case.

AB In this work, we introduce the ConvPDE-UQ framework for constructing light-weight numerical solvers for partial differential equations (PDEs) using convolutional neural networks. A theoretical justification for the neural network approximation to partial differential equation solvers on varied domains is established based on the existence and properties of Green's functions. These solvers are able to effectively reduce the computational demands of traditional numerical methods into a single forward-pass of a convolutional network. The network architecture is also designed to predict pointwise Gaussian posterior distributions, with weights trained to minimize the associated negative log-likelihood of the observed solutions. This setup facilitates simultaneous training and uncertainty quantification for the network's solutions, allowing the solver to provide pointwise uncertainties for its predictions. The associated training procedure avoids the computationally expensive Bayesian inference steps used by other state-of-the-art uncertainty models and allows training to be scaled to the large data sets required for learning on varied problem domains. The performance of the framework is demonstrated on three distinct classes of PDEs consisting of two linear elliptic problem setups and a nonlinear Poisson problem. After a single offline training procedure for each class, the proposed networks are capable of accurately predicting the solutions to linear and nonlinear elliptic problems with heterogeneous source terms defined on any specified two-dimensional domain using just a single forward-pass of a convolutional neural network. Additionally, an analysis of the predicted pointwise uncertainties is presented with experimental evidence establishing the validity of the network's uncertainty quantification schema.

AB We focus on improving the accuracy of an approximate model of a multiscale dynamical system that uses a set of parameter-dependent terms to account for the effects of unresolved or neglected dynamics on resolved scales. We start by considering various methods of calibrating and analyzing such a model given a few well-resolved simulations. After presenting results for various point estimates and discussing some of their shortcomings, we demonstrate (a) the potential of hierarchical Bayesian analysis to uncover previously unanticipated physical dependencies in the approximate model, and (b) how such insights can then be used to improve the model. In effect parametric dependencies found from the Bayesian analysis are used to improve structural aspects of the model. While we choose to illustrate the procedure in the context of a closure model for buoyancy-driven, variable-density turbulence, the statistical nature of the approach makes it more generally applicable. Towards addressing issues of increased computational cost associated with the procedure, we demonstrate the use of a neural network based surrogate in accelerating the posterior sampling process and point to recent developments in variational inference as an alternative methodology for greatly mitigating such costs. We conclude by suggesting that modern validation and uncertainty quantification techniques such as the ones we consider have a valuable role to play in the development and improvement of approximate models.

AB Computational electrodynamics (CED), the numerical solution of Maxwell's equations, plays an incredibly important role in several problems in science and engineering. High accuracy solutions are desired, and the discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method is one of the better ways of delivering high accuracy in numerical CED. Maxwell's equations have a pair of involution constraints for which mimetic schemes that globally satisfy the constraints at a discrete level are highly desirable. Balsara and Kappeli (2019) presented a von Neumann stability analysis of globally constraint-preserving DG schemes for CED up to fourth order. That paper was focused on developing the theory and documenting the superior dissipation and dispersion of DGTD schemes in media with constant permittivity and permeability. In this paper we present working DGTD schemes for CED that go up to fifth order of accuracy and analyze their performance when permittivity and permeability vary strongly in space.
   Our DGTD schemes achieve constraint preservation by collocating the electric displacement and magnetic induction as well as their higher order modes in the faces of the mesh. Our first finding is that at fourth and higher orders of accuracy, one has to evolve some zone-centered modes in addition to the face-centered modes. It is well-known that the limiting step in DG schemes causes a reduction of the optimal accuracy of the scheme; though the schemes still retain their formal order of accuracy with WENO-type limiters. In this paper, we document simulations where permittivity and permeability vary by almost an order of magnitude without requiring any limiting of the DG scheme. This very favorable second finding ensures that DGTD schemes retain optimal accuracy even in the presence of large spatial variations in permittivity and permeability. We also study the conservation of electromagnetic energy in these problems. Our third finding shows that the electromagnetic energy is conserved very well even when permittivity and permeability vary strongly in space; as long as the conductivity is zero.

AB We propose energy-conserving discontinuous Galerkin (DG) methods for symmetric linear hyperbolic systems on general unstructured meshes. Optimal a priori error estimates of order k + 1 are obtained for the semi-discrete scheme in one dimension, and in multi-dimensions on Cartesian meshes when tensor-product polynomials of degree k are used. A high-order energy-conserving Lax-Wendroff time discretization is also presented.
   Extensive numerical results in one dimension, and two dimensions on both rectangular and triangular meshes are presented to support the theoretical findings and to assess the new methods. One particular method (with the doubling of unknowns) is found to be optimally convergent on triangular meshes for all the examples considered in this paper. The method is also compared with the classical (dissipative) upwinding DG method and (conservative) DG method with a central flux. It is numerically observed for the new method to have a superior performance for long time simulations. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Numerical simulation of biofluids entails solving equations of fluid-structure interactions. At zero Reynolds number, solvers such as the Method of Regularized Stokeslets (MRS) give rise to large and dense matrices in practical applications where the number of structures immersed in the fluid is large. Building on previous work for an unbounded fluid domain, we first extend the Kernel-Independent Fast Multipole Method (KIFMM) for MRS to compute the matrix-vector products for the fluid flow induced by point forces above a stationary wall. In this case, the use of a regularized image system introduces additional terms to the solution which cause the matrix-vector multiplication to be quite challenging. In addition, we study the case where a linear system needs to be solved for the unknown forces that structures with known velocities exert on the fluid. Our main contribution is proposing several preconditioning techniques for the matrices associated with a few variants of MRS, including the case where a force-free, torque-free condition is imposed. They take advantage of the data-sparsity of FMM matrices as well as properties of Krylov subspaces. Our approach is memory efficient, capable of handling non-uniformly distributed structures and applicable to all FMM matrices. It enables efficient computation of the flow field surrounding a large group of dynamic micro-structures; in particular, we study the effects of fluid mixing caused by the periodic beating of a dense carpet of lung cilia.

AB In this paper we propose a novel set of first-order hyperbolic equations that can model dispersive non-hydrostatic free surface flows. The governing PDE system is obtained via a hyperbolic approximation of the family of non-hydrostatic free-surface flow models recently derived by Sainte-Marie et al. in [1]. Our new hyperbolic reformulation is based on an augmented system in which the divergence constraint of the velocity is coupled with the other conservation laws via an evolution equation for the depth-averaged non-hydrostatic pressure, similar to the hyperbolic divergence cleaning applied in generalized Lagrangian multiplier methods (GLM) for magnetohydrodynamics (MHD). We suggest a formulation in which the divergence errors of the velocity field are transported with a large but finite wave speed that is directly related to the maximal eigenvalue of the governing PDE.
   We then use arbitrary high order accurate (ADER) discontinuous Galerkin (DG) finite element schemes with an a posteriori subcell finite volume limiter in order to solve the proposed PDE system numerically. The final scheme is highly accurate in smooth regions of the flow and very robust and positive preserving for emerging topographies and wet-dry fronts. It is well-balanced making use of a path-conservative formulation of HLL-type Riemann solvers based on the straight line segment path. Furthermore, the proposed ADER-DG scheme with a posteriori subcell finite volume limiter adapts very well to modern GPU architectures, resulting in a very accurate, robust and computationally efficient computational method for non-hydrostatic free surface flows. The new model proposed in this paper has been applied to idealized academic benchmarks such as the propagation of solitary waves, as well as to more challenging physical situations that involve wave runup on a shore including wave breaking in both one and two space dimensions. In all cases the achieved agreement with analytical solutions or experimental data is very good, thus showing the validity of both, the proposed mathematical model and the numerical solution algorithm.

AB Efficient and suitably preconditioned iterative solvers for elliptic partial differential equations (PDEs) of the convection-diffusion type are used in all fields of science and engineering, including for example computational fluid dynamics, nuclear reactor simulations and combustion models. To achieve optimal performance, solvers have to exhibit high arithmetic intensity and need to exploit every form of parallelism available in modern manycore CPUs. This includes both distributed- or shared memory parallelisation between processors and vectorisation on individual cores.
   The computationally most expensive components of the solver are the repeated applications of the linear operator and the preconditioner. For discretisations based on higher-order Discontinuous Galerkin methods, sum-factorisation results in a dramatic reduction of the computational complexity of the operator application while, at the same time, the matrix-free implementation can run at a significant fraction of the theoretical peak floating point performance. Multigrid methods for high order methods often rely on block-smoothers to reduce high-frequency error components within one grid cell. Traditionally, this requires the assembly and expensive dense matrix solve in each grid cell, which counteracts any improvements achieved in the fast matrix-free operator application. To overcome this issue, we present a new matrix-free implementation of block-smoothers. Inverting the block matrices iteratively avoids storage and factorisation of the matrix and makes it is possible to harness the full power of the CPU. We implemented a hybrid multigrid algorithm with matrix-free block-smoothers in the high order Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) space combined with a low order coarse grid correction using algebraic multigrid where only low order components are explicitly assembled. The effectiveness of this approach is demonstrated by solving a set of representative elliptic PDEs of increasing complexity, including a convection dominated problem and the stationary SPE10 benchmark.

AB We present a self-contained description of the wave-function matching (WFM) method to calculate electronic quantum transport properties of nanostructures using the Landauer-Buttiker approach. The method is based on a partition of the system between a central region ("conductor") containing N-S sites and an asymptotic region ("leads") characterized by N-P open channels. The two subsystems are linearly coupled and solved simultaneously using an efficient sparse linear solver. Invoking the sparsity of the Hamiltonian matrix representation of the central region, we show that the number of operations required by the WFM method in conductance calculations scales linearly with the number of sites, more precisely with similar to N-S x N-P for large N-S, faster than previously claimed.

AB Physical effects driven by strong electromagnetic fields often occur in regions of highly localized fields on a scattering object. Unfortunately, the most common numerical technique for simulating time-domain electromagnetics, known as Finite-Difference Time Domain (FDTD), is ill-equipped to handle such problems. A common solution to capture physics across many spatial scales is to use an adaptive mesh, which resolves temporal or spatial features exactly when and where they are needed, avoiding extra computation in space-time regions where it is unnecessary. We present a minimal modification to the FDTD algorithm that allows for a stable late-time solution to Maxwell's equations on an adaptive mesh with a Courant-Friedrichs-Levy limit of 5/6. An emphasis is placed on creating a simple, flexible, and easy to understand algorithm. The algorithm is implemented in 1D, 2D and 3D for geometries which are dynamic or possess large disparities in spatial or temporal scales. An example is presented which demonstrates the use of the algorithm in a resonant dielectric disc with a small slot. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB In this paper, the Monte Carlo Markov chain method for solving the modified anomalous fractional sub-diffusion equation is studied. Most of the previous methods are low in temporal and spatial accuracy order. Based on the idea of Monte Carlo Markov chain method and compact finite difference schemes, a probability model for solving the modified anomalous fractional sub-diffusion equation is established. Numerical examples are given to show the feasibility of the proposed scheme. Compared with the compact finite difference method, the present method is truly meshless and is easy to be implemented with high temporal and spatial accuracy order. And it is also applied to solve partial differential equation in irregular domains. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The goal of this paper is to propose a single interface treatment, based on the Dirichlet-Robin interface condition to deal with all steady CHT scenarios. These scenarios depend on the so-called numerical Biot number that controls the stability process and the optimal coefficient that ensures, in theory, unconditional stability. It is shown that this coefficient is closely related to fundamental thermal quantities. For very large thermal fluid-solid interactions, the Dirichlet-Robin condition may result in profound stability issues. A thorough examination of the stability behavior has highlighted a narrow and slow varying stable zone located around the optimal coefficient. This allows us to determine coupling coefficients valid in any case and the reasonable value of these coefficients avoids significantly impairing the accuracy of CHT solutions. A flat plate, partially protected by a thermal barrier coating, is presented as a test case. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB A time dependent model problem with the Riesz or the Riemann-Liouville fractional differential operator of order 1 < alpha < 2 is considered. By penalyzing the primary variable of the minimal dissipation Local Discontinuous Galerkin (mdLDG) method with a term of order h(1-alpha) and using a von Neumann analysis, stability conditions proportional to h(alpha) are derived for the forward Euler method and both fractional operators in one dimensional domains. The CFL condition is numerically studied with respect to the approximation degree and the stabilization parameter. Our analysis and computations carried out using explicit high order strong stability preserving Runge-Kutta schemes reveal that the proposed penalization term is suitable for high order approximations and explicit time advancing schemes when a is close to one. A series of numerical experiments in 1D and 2D problems are presented to validate our theoretical results and those not covered by the theory. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB In this paper, a surface integral equation formulation for the prediction of corrosion related electrostatic fields of conducting structures in an electrolyte is presented. The integral equation is discretized using the Locally Corrected Nystrom method. An iterative technique based on the Newton-Raphson method is described for use with nonlinear boundary conditions, and a Schur complement method is discussed to help improve the nonlinear solution efficiency. An image plane method is applied when an appropriate planar electrolyte-insulating bounding surface is present. The methods are validated by analysis of a canonical problem with analytic solution and by comparison to literature data. Higher-order solution convergence is observed for the canonical problem results. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB 2D elastic plane wave diffraction by a stress-free wedge is a canonical problem of interest to researchers in many different fields. To our knowledge, no fully analytical resolution has been found and semi-analytical evaluations of asymptotic approximations have therefore become a common approach. In this paper, a method called the spectral functions method is developed in the aforementioned 2D configuration. This method has the advantage of being valid for wedge angles lower and higher than pi. The diffracted displacement field is expressed as an integral in terms of two unknown functions called the spectral functions. These functions are decomposed into two parts: one which can be computed analytically and the other which is approached numerically using a collocation method. The details of the corresponding numerical scheme are given and the method is validated numerically for all wedge angles. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB We proposed a novel multi-moment finite volume method (MMFVM) to compute compressible viscous flows on arbitrary unstructured grids. Unlike the previous volumeaverage/point-value multi-moment (VPM) method (Xie et al. 2014 [60]), the present method, so-called VPM-Ex (VPM with extended-stencil reconstruction), formulates novel spatial reconstructions with substantially improved robustness and accuracy for both smooth and discontinuous solutions. Our efforts in this work have brought at least the following new features to the numerical formulation: 1) a more robust and accurate spatial reconstruction based on the stencil of all immediately adjacent cells that supports higher-order limiting projection; 2) two different options for both explicit and implicit reconstructions; 3) a simplified and more accurate formulation for point-value. In addition, we have proposed a smoothness-adaptive fitting (SAF) method for limiting projection to improve the solution quality for discontinuities. The resulting reconstruction method that combines VPM-Ex scheme with SAF-based limiting projection schemes is able to attain 3rd-order accuracy for smooth solution, and non-oscillatory and less-dissipative numerical results for discontinuous solution on unstructured grids of different types of elements. The numerical method has been extensively verified by various benchmark tests for scalar conservation equation, Euler equations and Navier-Stokes equations in 2 and 3 dimensions. The numerical results substantiate that the present method provides a novel numerical formulation of great practical significance to accurately resolve both continuous and discontinuous solutions.

Finding good target voltages/currents for the control systems is a very laborious, non-trivial task due to non-linear effects of plasma evolution. We introduce here an optimal control formulation to tackle this task and present in detail the main ingredients for finding numerical solutions: the finite element discretization, accurate linearizations and Sequential Quadratic Programming.

FD-NILSS does not require tangent solvers, and can be implemented with little modification to existing numerical simulation software. We also give a formula for solving the least-squares problem in FD-NILSS, which can be applied in NILSS as well. Finally, we apply FD-NILSS for sensitivity analysis of a chaotic flow over a 3-D cylinder at Reynolds number 525, where FD-NILSS computes accurate sensitivities and the computational cost is in the same order as the numerical simulation.

AB Computational fluid dynamics is an invaluable tool for both the design and analysis of aerospace vehicles. Reliable error estimation techniques are needed to ensure that simulation results are accurate enough to be used in engineering decision-making processes. In this work, a framework for estimating error and improving solution accuracy is presented. A linearized error transport equation (ETE) is used to estimate local discretization errors. A truncation error estimation technique is proposed which combines aspects of higher-order residual methods and continuous residual methods. The equivalence between adjoint and ETE methods for functional error estimation is demonstrated. Using adjoint/ETE equivalence, the higher-order properties of adjoint methods are extended to ETE methods. Consequently, ETE error estimates are shown to converge to the true discretization error at a higher-order rate. ETE error estimates are then used to correct the entire primal solution, and by extension, all output functionals, to higher order. The computational advantages of this ETE approach are discussed. Results are presented for 1D and 2D inviscid and viscous flow problems on grids with smoothly varying and non-smoothly varying grid metrics. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Microscopic (pore-scale) properties of porous media affect and often determine their macroscopic (continuum- or Darcy-scale) counterparts. Understanding the relationship between processes on these two scales is essential to both the derivation of macroscopic models of, e.g., transport phenomena in natural porous media, and the design of novel materials, e.g., for energy storage. Microscopic properties exhibit complex statistical correlations and geometric constraints that present challenges for the estimation of macroscopic quantities of interest (QoIs), e.g., in the context of global sensitivity analysis (GSA) of macroscopic QoIs with respect to microscopic material properties. We present a systematic way of building correlations into stochastic multiscale models through Bayesian Networks. The proposed framework allows us to construct the joint probability density function (PDF) of model parameters through causal relationships that are informed by domain knowledge and emulate engineering processes, e.g., the design of hierarchical nanoporous materials. These PDFs also serve as input for the forward propagation of parametric uncertainty thereby yielding a Bayesian Network PDE. To assess the impact of causal relationships and microscale correlations on macroscopic material properties, we propose a moment-independent GSA and corresponding effect rankings for Bayesian Network PDEs, based on the differential Mutual Information, that leverage the structure of Bayesian Networks and account for both correlated inputs and complex non-Gaussian (skewed, multimodal) QoIs. Our findings from numerical experiments, which feature a non-intrusive uncertainty quantification workflow, indicate two practical outcomes. First, the inclusion of correlations through structured priors based on causal relationships informed by domain knowledge impacts predictions of QoIs and has important implications for engineering design. Second, structured priors with non-trivial correlations yield different effect rankings than independent priors; these rankings are more consistent with the anticipated physics.

ID TRANSPORT
AB A Smoothed Dissipative Particle Dynamics formulation with dynamic virtual particle allocation (SDPD-DV) is developed for the simulation of mesoscale nonisothermal flows with non-slip, constant temperature and constant heat flux boundary conditions. For liquids, the particle internal energy is evaluated through a first-order expansion from an initial volume and entropy state. For liquids, the particle pressure and temperature are evaluated using the coefficients of adiabatic compressibility, volumetric thermal expansion and heat capacity. For monatomic and diatomic gases, the fluid particle internal energy is evaluated through a Sackur-Tetrode type of equation. For both liquids and gases, the viscosity and thermal conductivity are modeled by a power law. Integration of position and momentum equations is performed with a velocity-Verlet method and bounce-forward reflection. Integration of the entropy equation is performed with a Runge-Kutta method. Verification of SDPD-DV is performed for planar isothermal Couette, planar Fourier, and planar nonisothermal Couette flows of liquid H2O and gaseous N-2, and for a nonisothermal planar Poiseuille flow of a fluid with an exponential temperature-depended viscosity. SDPD-DV simulations for liquid H2O, gaseous Ar and N-2 systems under thermal equilibrium assess the impact of the ratio of particle mass (m(i)) over the real molecular mass and the size of smoothing length (h) on fluid properties, hydrodynamic fluctuations and transport coefficients. For liquid systems the density fluctuations exhibit scatter about the analytical estimates and the temperature fluctuations follow the analytical estimates for mass ratios smaller than 10,000. The velocity fluctuations are in excellent agreement with theoretical estimates. For gases, the density fluctuations exhibit scatter about the analytical estimates and the pressure fluctuations agree with the analytical estimates for mass ratios smaller than 10,000. The temperature and velocity fluctuations are in excellent agreement with the analytical estimates. The self-diffusivity evaluated from SDPD-DV simulations for liquid and gases is shown to increase with smoothing length for a given mass ratio, scales with h(2)/m(i), and is in excellent agreement with analytical estimates. The shear viscosity evaluated from SDPD-DV simulations for liquid and gases exhibits scatter around the experimental values and is shown to be scale free. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB We present an Immersed Interface Vortex Particle-Mesh (IIVPM) method in 2D and validate our approach. Unlike other VPM-based approaches, it converges in time and space up to the boundary, and hence it offers a sharp and accurate way to take the presence of obstacles into account. We first present the methodology and investigate its convergence. We then apply it to the benchmark of the impulsively started flow around a cylinder at various Reynolds numbers (from Re = 550 to Re = 40 000) and, in particular, we highlight the gain in accuracy brought by the sharp interface treatment.

AB In this paper, we develop the fully discrete local discontinuous Galerkin (LDG) methods coupled with the implicit-explicit (IMEX) multistep time marching for solving the nonlinear Cahn-Hilliard equation. To be more specific, we rewrite the Cahn-Hilliard equation in a novel form by adding and subtracting a "linear" term. Then we discretize the spatial derivatives with the LDG methods and the temporal derivative with the IMEX multistep method. Finally, a series of numerical experiments are given to verify the accuracy, efficiency and validness of proposed method. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB We combine continuous and discontinuous Galerkin methods in the setting of a model diffusion problem. Starting from a hybrid discontinuous formulation, we replace element interiors by more general subsets of the computational domain - groups of elements that support a piecewise-polynomial continuous expansion. This step allows us to identify a new weak formulation of Dirichlet boundary condition in the continuous framework. We show that the boundary condition leads to a stable discretization with a single parameter insensitive to mesh size and polynomial order of the expansion. The robustness of the approach is demonstrated on several numerical examples. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

In this paper, we present the theory and numerical implementation of a high-order discontinuous Galerkin method for computing CSR wake fields in a bunch compressor while including geometrical effects. We incorporate this method in our code: CSRDG (Coherent Synchtrotron Radiation with Discontinuous Galerkin). Using this code, wake potentials and associated quantities are calculated for the simple case of an electron bunch propagating along a single bend structure as well as for a complete bunch compressor chamber of the European XFEL.

DE Discontinuous-Galerkin; Tensor-product; Preconditioning; Matrix-free;

ID UNIFIED ANALYSIS
AB We present a tensor-product-based preconditioner for high-order discontinuous-Galerkin (DG) discretizations. The preconditioner is based on approximating the block diagonal of the Jacobian matrix corresponding to element-wise coupling with the sum of tensor products of small one-dimensional matrices. The preconditioner is obtained through an algebraic procedure which minimizes the error between the tensor-product approximation and the exact elemental block Jacobian.
   Inverting the full elemental block Jacobian requires O(N-d) memory storage and O(N-2d) operations, while applying its inverse requires O(N-d) operations per degree of freedom, where N is the solution order and d is the dimension of the problem. Thus, traditional block preconditioners become impractical with increasing dimension, d, and order, N. The cost of forming, storing, or applying the current tensor-product-based preconditioner scales linearly with solution order (O(N)) per degree of freedom for arbitrary number of dimensions. Furthermore, the tensor-product-based preconditioner recovers the exact block-Jacobi preconditioner in the case of constant-coefficient scalar problems on right parallelepiped elements. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the preconditioner for solving 4D (3D-space+time) DG discretizations of scalar advection-diffusion problems up to 32nd order. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

AB Cellulose acetate (CA) membranes have shortages of low permeability and membrane fouling. A novel polymer additive (denoted as PA) has both hydrophilic and oleophobic groups was synthesized from CA via a one-step reaction. Blend membrane fabricated from mixing CA and PA in 4: 1 showed improved membrane properties. By adding 1 wt% of PVPk30, the pure water flux of blend CA membrane was increased from 0 to 34.0 L/m(2).h.bar. The filtration experiments indicated the membranes exhibited good antifouling property, excellent anti-oil performance that 92.5% of oil rejections and 90% relative flux recovery were obtained.

AB To develop the high-efficient visible-light photocatalyst with good recyclability is curial for its application in environment remediation. Herein, three-dimensional (3D) MoS2 nanosheet/graphene aerogel (MoS2 NS/GA) has been prepared by using 3D GA as the framework from the hydrothermal method. The prepared 3D MoS2 NS/GA is characterized and shows, even a small amount, high efficiency for photodegrading the concentrated TC-HCl. Moreover, the lost activity could be recovered by the compensation with S-2 ions. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The microwave absorption of two-dimensional MXene Ti3C2Tx, prepared by exfoliating the Ti3AlC2 phase with a solution of HCl and LiF, was investigated in the frequency range of 2-18 GHz. Further, the impact of diverse etching times on the structure, morphology, and dielectric properties was considered. The minimum reflection loss value was -27.5 dB at 17.1 GHz for the Ti3C2Tx -24 sample, which was remarkably better than that of Ti3AlC2 (-6.7 dB), owing to multilayer reflections and scattering in the middle of the laminate structure. Thus, two-dimensional MXene was successfully synthesized herein via an effective method, suggesting that Ti3C2Tx MXenes are promising candidates as electromagnetic absorbing materials.

AB Fluorination is a promising functionalization method for bandgap opening in graphene on SiO2 substrates. Exposure to XeF2 is a simple approach among several techniques. However etching of the graphene layer occurs. We observed that the mechanism behind etching is the interaction of fluorine containing species with the underlying SiO2. Pulsed XeF2 exposure is shown to suppress etching, resulting in high-quality and homogeneous fluorographene in large areas. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB We report a novel hot-injection route to synthesize meso/macroporous beta-In2S3 ultrathin nanosheets (UTNSs) with about 1.2 nm in thickness and a few micrometers in lateral dimensions using oleic acid (OA) as capping agent and liquid paraffin (LP) as reductive solvent. A reasonable formation mechanism involving redox reaction and oriented-growth was proposed: sulphur powder is reduced to S-2 in LP by dehydrogenation process, and then reacts with In3+ to form In2S3 UTNSs under the inductive agent of OA and chloride ion. The large band gap (similar to 2.34 eV) and obvious blue-shifted absorption edge in the UV-Vis diffuse reflectance spectrum indicate a strong quantum confinement effect resulted from ultrathinness structure. This low-cost and environment-friendly synthesis strategy provides an extended route to synthesize chalcogenide nanomaterials with ultrathin sheet-structure. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

ID GYPSUM
AB Silicon dioxide, also known as silica, is the most abundant mineral in the Earth's crust. Mixed with gypsum plaster, kaolin and water, they form the main components used in the composition of Kiln-casting glass molds. However, the silica used for these types of molds has very fine granulometry (37-74 mu m), which can lead to health problems and, in addition, it goes through purification processes, generating additional costs. Thus, aiming to propose a healthier and cheaper alternative for fine pure silica in molds composition, this work proposes the use of sea and river sand (300-700 mu m) in substitution of it. The raw materials and compositions used in this study were analyzed and tested by Optical Microscopy, X-ray Fluorescence, Scanning Electron Microscopy and Compression Tests. The compositions with fine pure silica and river sand proved to be more resistant, both before and after being subjected to a heat treatment. On the other hand, the composition with sea sand presented lower resistance, and this was regarded as a desirable feature for complex pieces, making easier their demolding. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB Perovskite-type lanthanide oxide is a new kind of promising electrode material for supercapacitor. In this study, La1-xSrxMn0.9Ni0.1O3 nanofibers with different Sr substitutions are prepared by electrospun method and used as electrode material firstly. The effect of Sr substitution on the structure of LaMn0.9Ni0.1O3 perovskite has been investigated, and the electrochemical properties have been tailored correspondingly. Minor Sr substitution introduces some oxygen vacancies into the perovskite structure, and optimizes the specific capacitance. However, excessive Sr substitution causes lattice distortion of the perovskite structure and deteriorates the electrochemical performance instead. The highest specific capacitance of 113.9 F.g(-.1) is obtained in La0.85Sr0.15Mn0.9Ni0.1O3 component. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The influence of nano-clay (NC) content on the hydration and microstructure of cement grouting material was investigated under sodium chloride solution. Five different NC cement pastes were prepared and studied by means of FT-IR, TG-DTG and SEM analysis. The results indicated that NC promoted the formation of the hydrate ettringite (AFt), and made the AFt transform from loose acicular into cylindrical shape of staggered reticulated skeleton structure. Besides, with the increase of NC content, calcium silicate hydrate (C-S-H) gel increased and the calcium hydroxide (CH) decreased, NC obviously reduced the porosity and made an increasingly dense microstructure. However, when the content of NC is more than 3 wt%, the hydration process is inhibited, and the effect of ion erosion resistance is still better than without NC. The results of compressive strength and chloride ion diffusion coefficient are better verified by microstructure. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A series of fibrous silica core-shell nanoparticles (NPs) were fabricated by using Prussian blue analogs (PBAs) as hard templates in a bicontinuous microemulsion system. Other than normal synthesis of fibrous silica, KOH was used instead of urea in the fabrication which was operated at lower temperature 40 degrees C without any cosolvent. Synthesized PBA@fibrous silica NPs could be easily oxidized to Co-Fe oxides@fibrous silica nanostructures. Furthermore, after acid etching process, corresponding hollow cubic silica nanoframes (HCSNF) with a fibrous morphology were finally achieved. Characterization results revealed that the size distribution of HCSNFs was 300 +/- 46 nm. Each HCSNF had a novel hollow region. This low-temperature cosolvent-free fabrication provides a new idea for expanding efficient synthetic methods and morphology of fibrous silica shell. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Aims: The thermal plasma treatment is an effective method which can be used to convert hazardous waste into less toxic or inert glassy products. The aim of this paper is to show the experimental use of a thermal plasma treatment process to transform the hospital incineration fly ash into glassy products (vitrificates) that can be stored on the land without harmful environmental effects or sintered for producing with some additives coloured tiles useful as construction materials.
   Scope: The aims were achieved by: (i) optimization of temperature and energy used adjusting the process to minimum cost and (ii) stabilization of vitrificates with different compositions of waste mixtures. The chemical stabilization of final products was examined by heavy metals leachability tests. Hardness measurements were done to verify the physical stabilization of vitrificates. Also, it has been tested if the reinforcement and coloration of raw material by various pigments as well as the chemical compounds affect the stability of the final products.
   Conclusion: It was seen that chemical composition of raw materials influenced the chemical and physical properties of the vitrificates and decided about their internal structures. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Excellent Rh,F,P-tridoped TiO2 nanosheets were developed by a microwave-hydrothermal method. 0.625%RFPTO exhibited the highest photoactivity (K-app = 3.92 x 10(-2) min(-1)), which is 39.5 times more than that of P25 TiO2 (K-app = 9.92 x 10(-4) min(-1)). XPS analysis revealed the existence of Rh3+ and Rh4+ in Ti-O-Rh linkage. Rh-doping led to red-shift of the absorbance edge of TiO2, but Rh,F,P-tridoping resulted in obvious blue-shift. Under simulated sunlight irradiation, their photoactivities increased in the order of P25 < TO < RTO < FTO < PTO < FPTO < 0.15%RFPTO < 1.25%RFPO < 0.3%RFPTO < 0.625%RFPTO, which was full accord with the increase in their photocurrent intensity, confirming that Rh,F,P-tridoping had synergetic effects in enhancing the carrier separation efficiency and photoactivity, and carrier separation efficiency played a key role in improving the photoactivity.

AB Recent studies regarding the development of high efficiency grain non-oriented (GNO) electrical steels demonstrate that development of columnar-grained microstructures prior to cold rolling is an efficient method to improve the magnetic behavior of the final product. However, the columnar morphology obtained by annealing of the hot-rolled bands was not developed after further processing by cold rolling and final annealing. Understanding the effects of plastic deformation on the development of such microstructures will help to promote them during the final annealing and improve even more the magnetic behavior of these materials. The present research reports the effects of small plastic deformations (0-25%) and annealing time (10-180 min) on the development of columnar microstructures in GNO electrical steels. The columnar grain growth is explained in terms of the strain induced grain boundary migration (SIBM) mechanism, based on the changes in the grain average misorientation (GAM) maps obtained by electron backscattering diffraction (EBSD).

ID MG2SI0.4SN0.6; EFFICIENCY; MG
AB Sb-doped Mg2Si0.5Sn0.5 materials were successfully prepared by a fast thermal explosion reaction for the first time. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns indicate that this new method easily converts the immiscible composition of 0.5Mg(2)Si-0.5Mg(2)Sn into a single-phase Mg2Si0.5Sn0.5 solid solution. With Sb content increasing, the dimensionless thermoelectric figure of merit ZT(peak) (peak value) and ZT(ave) (average value) are greatly improved, which are quite comparable to or even better than the values obtained by other methods. More importantly, this facile fabrication technique possesses attractive merits, such as high time-and energy-efficiency, low cost and the potential of mass production. Hence, a significant foundation has been laid for the future synthesis of other Mg-based and functional materials. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Phosphogypsum (PG) is a large amount of solid waste discharged from the phosphorus chemical industry and poses serious environmental pollution problems. The preparation of non-fired ceramics from PG is an effective method for substantially managing PG waste, but its actual production and utilization are difficult due to poor water resistance of PG. In this paper, a waterproof non-fired ceramic with a dense waterproof layer was prepared from PG by grafting silane coupling agent onto the PG non-fired ceramic and then coating it with unsaturated polyester resin. The bending strengths of waterproofed PG non-fired ceramics before and after soaking in water for 24 h were 20.5 and 15.2 MPa, respectively, and the corresponding softening coefficient was 0.74. Its water absorption rate was 1.12%, while contact angle was 81.6 degrees . The favorable qualities endow the waterproofed PG non-fired ceramics with broad application prospects in building materials. This technique has great potential to reduce the environmental pollution caused by PG with huge economic and social benefits. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The electrical properties of Hf- and Zr-based oxide thin films, which are related to their crystal structure, are sensitively dependent on their composition and process conditions. In particular, HfZrO2 mixed thin films, which have potential applicability as high-k dielectrics, can have various polarization phases, including paraelectric, ferroelectric, and anti-ferroelectric phases. Therefore, we investigated the enhancement of the dielectric properties of HfZrO2 thin films upon Al doping by confirming their polarization characteristics. Doping of the HfZrO2 thin film with a small amount of Al (similar to 2.5%) caused a remarkable increase in the dielectric constant to similar to 47 and modified the polarization phase from ferroelectric to paraelectric, and the doped film subsequently showed an excellent leakage current of about 2 x 10(-8) A/cm(2) at +/- 1 MV/cm. On the basis of these findings, we believe that Al-doped HfZrO2 films are promising candidates for use as paraelectric high-k dielectrics for dynamic random access memory capacitors, as gate dielectrics for high-speed transistors, and so on.

AB The effects of B on microstructure, pitting and intergranular corrosion in solution-annealed S31254 super austenitic stainless steels were systemically investigated. After solid solution treatment at 1200 degrees C for different time, the precipitation and grain size of S31254 with and without B steels were analyzed. Addition of B to S31254 promotes the redissolution of detrimental sigma (sigma) phases, and the optimum solid solution condition for B-containing S31254 is at 1200 degrees C for 2 h. The S31254 steels with B after solid solution treatment exhibited much better corrosion resistance than that without B, which is relative to the elimination of destructional sigma precipitates and the decrease of chromium-depleted region near the grain boundary. Moreover, the passive films of samples with B have increased Cr2O3 and Mo-rich oxides, which may be responsible for the improvement of corrosion resistance. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB The development of amphiphobic graphene aerogels (AGAs) with simpler fabrication procedure is of great significance to its real-life applications. Herein, we demonstrate the preparation of AGAs via one-pot hydrothermal method and their amphiphobic performance. AGAs exhibited a 3D porous structure with a low density, high surface area and porosity. Upon modification with fluorosilane, fluorosilanol groups with low surface energy grafted to graphene and tiny wrinkles were formed on the surface of graphene sheets, which was beneficial for the amphiphobic performance of AGAs. The water and oil contact angles of AGAs were 146.1 degrees and 92.2 degrees , respectively. When AGAs immersed in water or oil by application of an external force, they float immediately on water or oil surface without absorption of any water or oil, exhibiting excellent water/oil-repellency. The amphiphobic performance of aerogels can be exploited in a variety of applications, such as self-cleaning, anti-fouling and anti-fingerprint. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

   self-assembly; Polymeric composites
AB Shape memory polymeric actuators containing interfacial self-assembled silver nanowires (AgNWs) were fabricated. The morphology and electrothermal effect of the aligned AgNWs were investigated. Voltages as low as less than 2 V enabled rapid shape recovery, in which the speeds as well as nonlinearity of the shape memory-based actuation were comparatively studied. Two distinct actuation stages and the underlying mechanism were disclosed. The findings may greatly benefit the application of self assembly of nano building blocks in flexible electronics and soft robot fields. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID POLYANILINE; CAPACITANCE
AB Controllable design over the structure and morphology of active material is highly desirable for high performance supercapacitors. Here, coaxial binary composite MnO2/polyaniline was prepared by introducing tetraphenyl porphyrin tetrasulfonic acid interlayer (TPPS), as a crosslinking agent and dopant, to fabricate the three-dimensional hollow polyaniline (PANI) nanotube gel and then synthesizing nanoflaky MnO2 uniformly on the surface of PANI. Moreover, this coaxial structure is convenient for the ion and electrons transportation to exhibit excellent capacitive behavior with the capacitance of 575 F/g at 0.4 A/g. In addition, we assembled an asymmetric supercapacitor using MnO2/PANI as positive electrode, displaying high energy density (52.7 Wh/kg), remarkable durability and long cycling life (maintaining 90.2% initial capacitance after 2000 cycles). Using MnO2/PANI as inks for 3D-printed stamping is promising to be a novel fabricating method which can rapidly produce flexible microsupercapacitor for wearable micro devices.

AB Herein a one-step, easy, cheap and eco-friendly Solvothermal synthesis method has been used to synthesize monodisperse, uniform and ultrasmall chromium oxide (Cr2O3) nanocrystals (NCs). Transmission electron microscope (TEM) image of as-prepared Cr2O3 NCs shows the spherical shape with a uniform size of similar to 4.5 nm. The oxidation state of chromium ion has confirmed by absorption as well as electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy. Magnetic properties of as-synthesized NCs show low-temperature antiferromagnetic (AFM) exchange with Currie-Weiss (C-W) temperature circle minus = -160 K. Further, nearest neighbour exchange coupling constant J(NN) has found to be -16 K (Here K is Boltzmann constant) for Cr2O3 NCs by considering the nearest neighbours (Z) is 4. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB Selective Laser Melting (SLM) was employed for Additive Manufacturing (AM) of nearly equiatomic CoCrFeNiMn high-entropy alloy (HEA) and its matrix composite parts reinforced by 12 wt% nano-sized TiN particles (TiNP). HEA matrix microstructure of printed TiNP/HEA was remarkably refined and isotropic, rather than anisotropic coarse-grains of printed HEA in absence of TiNP. The ceramic reinforcements achieved a relatively uniform distribution in HEA matrix to contribute to the pinning effects for strengthening. High specific strength and good sliding-wear resistance of printed TiNP/HEA were achieved. The as-printed Gyroid architecture of TiNP/HEA exerted an elevated compression-resistance. The introduced TiNP, as a large number of nanoscale nucleation sites during SLM, benefits the formation of nearly equiaxed and ultrafine grains of HEA matrix for strengthening. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB The interface reaction between the Sn-0.7Cu-10Bi-0.15Co and Co substrate during multiple reflow cycles and the growth and evolution rhythm of intermetallic compounds (IMCs) were investigated. The results showed that as the reflow cycles increased in number, different growth morphologies and evolution rules of the IMCs layer including its primary growth, dissolution and secondary growth appeared. In the primary stage of multiple reflows, Co could be continuously diffused from the Co substrate to the IMCs/solder interface to provide enough Co for the growth of IMCs layer. As the IMCs layer became thick, the diffusion of Co to the interface was inhibited, and the dynamic equilibrium of IMCs growth was broken. When the growth rate was higher than the dissolution rate, the IMCs layer grew as a whole and whereas the IMCs were dissolved. And under the action of adsorption force, the dissolved IMCs particles re-aggregated and grew. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Microstructural analysis showed an unraveled amorphous matrix dotted with nanosized crystallites, which demonstrated that the softening of the nanodomains in the retained nanosized crystallites and hardening of the amorphous matrix during cooling over wide temperature range can trigger the Elinvar effect.

AB Polycrystalline Si thin films on insulating substrates have been widely used to fabricate thin film transistors. However, since randomly induced grain boundaries in the polycrystalline thin films have been degrading transistor performance, application of thin film transistors has been limited to low speed processing units such as display drivers. Here, in this letter, we have tried to realize single grain growth of Si thin film at controlled position. Aluminum induced layer exchange crystallization of Si thin film was performed at limited region to suppress spontaneous nucleation during the crystal growth, and thus, single grain Si thin films have been successfully realized on quartz glass substrates. This technique will open up a way to realize high speed processing thin film transistors. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Ultrasonic-assisted soldering was used for Ta/Sn/Al interconnection. The effects of ultrasonic waves on the dissolution and nucleation behavior of Al in Ta/Sn/Al joints during ultrasonic-assisted soldering were investigated. The cavitation induced by ultrasound waves lead to the continuous dissolution of the Al from substrate into molten Sn and the content of Al in solder increased rapidly. When the Al content reached saturation in the ultrasonic field, Al precipitated in the solder as second phase and nucleated on the substrates at the same time that Al dissolve into molten Sn from substrate. The behavior of nucleation on the Al substrate suppressed the growth of Al content in solder. The Al content in the bond was in dynamic equilibrium due to the dissolution and nucleation of Al. The maximum shear strength and bonding ratio of the joints were approximately 16 MPa and 86%, respectively. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A facile chemical precipitation has been successfully developed to fabricate nanoflake BiOI (1.259 g) by adding 1: 1 M ratio of Bi (NO3)(3)center dot 5H(2)O and 4 mM KI into the mixture of ethylene glycol and distilled water. Interestingly, with addition of 2 mM KI, bismuth-rich oxyiodide (Bi4O5I2, 0.848 g) with nanorose-shaped structure was obtained. In addition, after the collecting the precipitation of Bi4O5I2, the extra 2 mMKI was added in solution, 0.406 g of BiOI (named as BiOI-S) was produced. The quality of the obtained Bi4O5I2 and BiOI-S with each 2 mM KI addition is similar as the one step fabrication method using 4 mM KI. The synthesized hierarchical structure Bi4O5I2 with nanorose-shaped shows higher band gap energy (1.9 eV) than that of BiOI (1.7 eV), and higher specific surface area (36.9 m(2) g(-1)) than that of BiOI (28.1 m(2) g(-1)). Therefore, Bi4O5I2 nanorose-shaped showed superior photo-catalytic performance and degraded 92.3% of rhodamine B, which was 4 times faster than that of the pure BiOI. Our work may provide a facile strategy for efficient photocatalytic activity application in the treatment of water pollution via controlled KI addition. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this research, conductive magnetic fluid is prepared using carbon nanotubes (CNTs) as enhancing phase. The fluid is a superparamagnetic material. Experimental results show that CNTs form conductive networks. Meanwhile, surface treatment of CNTs is not conducive to enhance the conductivity, which has been confirmed by our calculations. More interestingly, when we apply an external magnetic field, the conductivity of the magnetic fluid increases along the magnetic field direction, showing anisotropy. These unique properties of the conductive magnetic fluid make it very promising in microwave absorbers and electromagnetic shields. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Distribution of mechanical properties around the shear bands in Al87Ni8La5 amorphous alloy was studied by atomic force microscopy (Peak Force QNM). The amorphous alloy was subjected to cold rolling. The deformation value was 50%. Numerous shear bands were observed in the alloy samples after the rolling. It is shown that inhomogeneity of the distribution of local properties (inhomogeneity of the distribution of the effective Young's modulus) arises in the deformed sample. The inhomogeneities form a system of bands. The thickness of the bands is 50-250 nm. Location of the regions of the low Young's modulus correlates with location of the shear bands.

AB In the present work, structural and morphological studies of grown tin oxide nanowires have been carried out with gold (Au), copper (Cu) and nickel (Ni) metals as catalysts. We have deposited tin oxide onto different metal catalysts (Au, Cu and Ni) coated silicon substrates through the thermal evaporation technique. The growth of tin oxide nanostructures on different catalysts has been analyzed at an optimized temperature. With the help of data of chemical and physical parameters of these catalysts, we developed a model which supports the experimental results for the growth of tin oxide nanowires. It has been found that among these catalysts, Ni shows highest aspect ratio nanostructure. Results are also supported by the optical studies. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB This study aims to test the potential of histatin 5, cystatin S and alpha-amylase to reduce the colonization of three important oral species; Streptococcus gordonii, Fusobacterium nucleatum and Porphyromonas gingivalis on two titanium (Ti) implant surfaces with different roughness and wettability. Pre-treatment (TiPT) and sandblasted and acid-etched (TiSLA) Ti surfaces, were facilitated by the Institut Straumann. The Ti surfaces were coated for two hours with either each salivary protein and the levels of protein adsorption were quantified by ELISA. The pre-coated substrates were incubated during 24 h with each bacterial strain, then bacterial colonization was measured by the counting of colony forming units and by fluorescence microscopy. Results showed that histatin 5 had the highest adsorption on the Ti surfaces, regardless of their roughness and wettability. However, bacterial colonization of each strain was selectively influenced by the presence of the salivary proteins adsorbed on the Ti substrates. The surfaces coated with alpha-amylase, decreased the adhesion of S. gordonii and F. nucleatum, while the pre-incubation with histatin 5 significantly reduced the colonization of P. gingivalis. Our results showed that bacterial colonization of the three oral bacteria could be selectively reduced by salivary proteins like histatin 5, cystatin S or alpha-amylase. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB The intrinsic and co-doped nano TiO2 particles were synthesized by sol-gel method. The crystal structure was characterized by X-ray diffraction and high-resolution electron microscopy. An obviously shift toward longer wavelengths direction can be observed in the UV-visible absorption spectra, and the band gap can be estimated to be 2.4 eV. The response range of the TiO2 photocatalyst can be widened from UV to visible light. The results of photocatalysis study show that co-doped nano TiO2 shows good photocatalytic performance. The transition metal and rare earth element co-doped TiO2 nano particles will be a very attractive candidate for the wastewater degradation and environmental protection. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB We have demonstrated a novel strategy to enhance mechanical strength by designing dual-network (DN) structures. The novel self-healing hydrogel system composed of silk fibroin powder (SFP) and polyacrylamide (PAM) combines hydrogen bond supramolecular action. In addition, this system was prepared via a simple one-pot method of copolymerization. The SFP-PAM hydrogels could achieve high mechanical properties. The stress and strain at break were 0.65 MPa and 2250%, respectively. The hydrogels exhibited adhesive and self-healing properties. The fabricated multifunctional SFP-PAM hydrogel shows promise in potential applications in wound dressing and transparent artificial skins for body-adhered signal detection. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB Owning to the high toxicity and mobility of hexavalent chromium (Cr(VI)), the removal has caused tremendous attention recently. In this study, an obvious improvement on Cr(VI) removal can be achieved for polyaniline nanofibers (PANFs) by removing ammonia via heating treatment. The as-prepared PANFs manifest high removal capacity of 275.46 mg/g, being more than 10% and 50% increase compared to PANFs obtained without ammonia removal and general chemically synthesized particles. The excellent removal performances can be ascribed to the synergistic effect between uniform morphology, high specific surface area and good conductivity, which can provide large amount of active sites for Cr(VI) uptake. Benefiting from the easy control of morphology and structure as well as large-scale production, the present approach exhibits great promising to develop low-cost absorbents for removing heavy metal ions with high efficiency and multiple reuses to enhance their applicability on an industrial scale.

AB Ti3+ self-doped TiO2 nanoparticles with fusiform-like morphology were prepared via a facile mixed solvothermal method to optimize the use of visible light and reduce the recombination of photogenerated electrons and holes. The physicochemical properties and photocatalytic activities of the nanoparticles were studied under visible light irradiation. The amounts of triethylamine content in the solvent affect the crystallinity, morphology and photoelectrochemical properties. The crystallinity and morphology of the samples can be controlled by changing the triethylamine concentration. Transient photocurrent response and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy results indicated that the sample with the largest aspect ratio had the highest photocurrent density and electron-hole separation efficiency.

AB Electrospinning is an emerging technique to fabricate nanofibrous nonwoven membranes, but the weak mechanical strength of electrospun products is blocking their applications. In this research, the PI nanofibrous nonwoven membranes were afforded via electrospinning and reinforced by facilely dipping into a diluted epoxy resin solution. There was fusion of fibers at the points of contact or cross among them, which provided about 4 times stronger strength than that of pristine PI ones and higher elongation at break. Furthermore, the epoxy reinforced PI membrane was not fuzzing and had strong adhesion to substrates. They exhibited good filtration efficiency and did not increase pressure-drop overwhelmingly although the average pore size reduced. This research suggested a feasible strategy to fabricate epoxy resin reinforced nanofibrous membranes, which would be promising applications in air filtration, battery's separator, water treatment etc. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB High efficiency and low heat input are the pursuit of modern welding. In this paper, an innovative high frequency electric cooperated arc welding (HFAW) was developed. The process and joint characteristics of the HFAW were compared with that of traditional arc welding (TAW). In the HFAW, a part of welding heat is generated all over the surface of weld side wall (WSW) directly and rapidly due to the skin effect and proximity effect of high frequency current. The limitation of heat conduction on the TAW was broken through. Benefited from the ultra-speed welding thermal process, the HFAW reaches 3-4 times the welding speed of the TAW, while the heat input needed in the HFAW was only about 60% that in the TAW. Meanwhile, the HFAW joint presented sound weld formation, complete penetration and finer microstructure, which made the joint possess an equal tensile strength with the base metal.

AB The effect of Ca content on the microstructure and tensile property of AE42 alloy was studied. By increasing Ca content, the microstructure changed from dendrite crystal to equiaxed grain, and the grains were refined continuously. The Al2Ca phase which has higher heat resistance was formed, replacing the original Al11Sm3 phase, and the formation of Mg17Al12 phase was effectively inhibited. Moreover, the addition of Ca significantly improved the yield strength of AE42 alloy at both room and elevated temperatures. Furthermore, the tensile strength of AE42 alloy at elevated temperature was improved significantly. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB SnO2/Sn6O4(OH)(4) composites were spontaneously formed by mechanically grinding and subsequently aging SnCl2 and NH4HCO3 powder. Results showed that the ground product consisted of SnCl2 center dot 2H(2)O and NH4Cl. After 1 day of aging treatment, SnCl2 center dot 2H(2)O was spontaneously decomposed to SnO2 and Sn6O4(OH)(4). FE-SEM results indicated that these as-synthesized grains had an average size of 60 nm. The photocatalytic degradation activity of this prepared sample to MO was negligible. Adding surfactants, such as SDBS and CTAB, may obviously enhance Sn6O4(OH)(4) synthesis. These samples containing a surfactant had a good photocatalytic activity. CTAB had the most obvious promoting effect and could degrade 98% MO within 60 min under visible light irradiation. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A composite containing parallel-connected layers of a porous ferroelectric PZT-type ceramic and porous polymer is manufactured, and effective piezoelectric properties and hydrostatic parameters are first studied for 2-0-2-0 connectivity. An influence of air pores in different layers on the longitudinal (d(33)*) and hydrostatic (d(h)* and g(h)*) piezoelectric coefficients, and squared hydrostatic figure of merit d(h)*g(h)* of the composite is analysed. Large values of d(33)* approximate to 400-600 pC/N, d(h)* approximate to 300-500 pC/N, g(h)* approximate to 100-150 mV m/N, and d(h)*g(h)* approximate to (30-60) 10(-12) Pa-1 suggest that this material has no analogs among ceramic-based composites and is suitable for piezoelectric sensor and hydroacoustic applications.

AB Ti3Sn has received increasing attention as high damping metallic material. However, information of solid state transformation and crystal structure of Ti3Sn were still incomplete. Here, in-situ synchrotron high energy XRD during heating/cooling and during uniaxial compressive loading were used to study the phase transformation of Ti3Sn. Thermal-induced reversible phase transformation of Ti3Sn was demonstrated, and it was found that such transformation could also be stress (strain) induced. Crystal structure, lattice parameters and atomic Wyckoff positions of new base-centered orthorhombic phase of Ti3Sn were suggested based on Rietveld refinement of XRD profiles. The phase contents of Ti3Sn during heating/cooling processes were also discussed. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Conceptually novel strategies have been developed for extraction of inorganic particles from a synthesis medium to a device processing medium using undecanal as a particle receiving liquid and a phase transfer vehicle. Another major finding was the feasibility of liquid-solid extraction and formation of new organic-inorganic gels using inorganic particles as gelators. Building on the advantages offered by liquid-liquid extraction we fabricated advanced MnO2-multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT) electrodes for supercapacitors, which showed a capacitance of 6.3 F cm(-2). The key to achieving enhanced capacitance was agglomerate-free processing of MnO2 and improved mixing of MnO2 and MWCNT. The extraction and gel formation mechanisms were analyzed using MnO2, Al(OH)(3), ZnO, CeO2 particles and MWCNT. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Noble metal doping has been a promising efficient way to improve the performance of supercapacitor. Herein, we report on the incorporation of Pt into MoS2 nanosheets grown on carbon cloth via a hydrothermal method. Compared with pristine MoS2, Pt-doped MoS2 exhibited excellent enhanced capacitance of 250 F/g at 0.5 A/g, which was nearly twice of specific capacitance at 10 A/g. Simultaneously, asymmetric supercapacitor prepared demonstrated superior flexibility and capacitance of 42 F/g at 0.4 A/g with no obvious changes in performance under different angles.

TI Enhancement of microwave absorption bandwidth of polymer blend using
   ferromagnetic gadolinium silicide nanoparticles
SO MATERIALS LETTERS

DE Polymer nanocomposites; Dielectrics; Reflection loss (RL); RL bandwidth
AB Ferromagnetic gadolinium silicide (Gd5Si4) nanoparticles significantly enhance the microwave absorption bandwidth of a polymer blend (PVB-PEDOT:PSS). These materials are critically needed for various military and civilian applications such as X-band (8.2-12.4 GHz) and Ku-band (12.4-18 GHz) absorption. A single 1.2 mm thick layer of PVB-PEDOT: PSS-Gd5Si4 (PPGS) nanocomposite film shows the most promising bandwidth (8.2-18 GHz) with a minimum reflection loss of -14 dB. Mechanistically, dielectric loss (tan delta(e) approximate to 2.4) and magnetic loss (tan delta(m) approximate to 1.1) contributes more efficiently, and standard microwave simulation confirms the stored energy is predominant in PPGS nanocomposite which enhances the bandwidth.

ID FABRICATION; NANOWIRES
AB Anodization of copper was performed in potassium carbonate aqueous solution. Registered current curves allowed to claim that the anodic oxide film growth occurs according to the hard anodization mechanism. Detailed investigation of the anodization products revealed formation of nanowires made of crystalline phases including various oxides and complex phases containing hydroxyl anions and carbonates. It was found that the diameter of the nanowires grows linearly with the anodizing voltage between 30 (10 V) and 47 nm (50 V). The major, crystalline components of the anodically grown nanowires were: paramelaconite (Cu4O3), cuprite (Cu2O) and tenorite (CuO). The presence of malachite, Cu2CO3(OH)(2) was also reported and meant effective incorporation of the electrolyte anions into the growing anodic film. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Gelatin is a biocompatible polymer that is widely used in tissue engineering. Nowadays, nanofibrous scaffolds are produced mainly by the direct voltage spinning method which, however, does not currently have the same production capacity as the newly developed alternating current (AC) spinning technology. Using AC spinning, nanofibrous layers made from a 20% concentration of gelatin in a solvent system containing acetic acid, distilled water, and ethanol were spun. A solution containing minimal acetic acid which could still be spun optimally was searched for spinning. The produced gelatin nanofibrous layers were crosslinked and, under various conditions, subjected to mechanical testing. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this paper, the MgF2-doped (1 - x) MgTiO3-x(Ca0.8Sr0.2)TiO3 (x = 0.01-0.09) ceramics with high-quality factor (Q x f) and near-zero temperature coefficient of the resonant frequency (tau f) were synthesized by solid-state reaction method. The effects of MgF2 addition on the phase composition, sintering behavior, and microwave dielectric properties in this system were completely investigated. Furthermore, the sintering temperature of 3 wt% MgF2-doped 0.95MgTiO(3)-0.05(Ca0.8Sr0.2)TiO3 ceramics can be lowered to 1225 degrees C. Then, the best microwave dielectric properties of epsilon(r) similar to 19.99, Q x f similar to 90,100 GHz (at 8.72 GHz) and tau f similar to -2.9 ppm/degrees C were obtained. It provides a solid foundation for widespread applications of microwave dielectric substrates, filters, resonators, and patch antennas in modern wireless communication equipment.

ID DEFORMATION; NUCLEATION
AB The paper presents a molecular dynamics study on the propagation of an intrinsic stacking fault in a copper crystallite under tension. The study shows that the defect moves via the formation of four successive structural configurations in two adjacent regions at its front. Local decrease of atomic volume gives rise to the formation of intermediate structural configuration with bcc symmetry in one of the regions, while an increase of volume in other region leads to the formation of configuration with 13 nearest neighbors. Such intermediate configurations occur with an increase in the potential energy. The atomic volume and the potential energy take their initial values during final rearrangements which move the stacking fault on one elementary step. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Polyacrylic acid hydrogel doped with copper ferrite nanoparticles has been prepared and studied for the removal and degradation of organic dye (methylene blue) from wastewater. Phase purity of nanoparticles was confirmed by powder X-ray diffraction and EDX analysis. Raman spectra showed three bands at E-g, F(2)g and A(1g), attributing the formation of spinel phase with a band gap of 2.12 eV. Hydrogel composite showed an increase in weight by 1771% when soaked in water. Degradation and absorption studies of methylene blue dye solution with copper ferrite nanoparticles as well as hydrogel nanocomposite suggest absorption of dye by hydrogel and degradation with copper ferrite nanoparticles. Such hydrogel nanocomposites could be a promising material for mitigation of water pollution caused by organic dyes discharged by small and medium scale industries. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB The high surface roughness of dip polydopamine (dPDA) coating on magnesium alloy could decrease the quality of secondary modification. In the present study, we report an electropolymerized dopamine (ePDA) coating on Mg-Zn-Y-Nd alloy from sodium salicylate aqueous solutions by galvanostat method to address this problem. The coating formation process and coating structure were investigated. Then, a Poly (L-lactic acid) (PLLA) coating was prepared on ePDA and dPDA treated samples. The SEM results reveal that the ePDA film appeared to be more uniform than dPDA coating and was doped with salicylate and magnesium ions. ASTM D3359-09 "Tape test" shows excellent adhesion of the ePDA/PLLA layer. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and polarization curves demonstrate ePDA/PLLA film has a better corrosion resistance than dPDA/PLLA film, owing to the structural difference of polydopamine anchoring layer.

AB The microstructure and properties of Cu-Ag can be tuned by doping with Sc. To strengthen Cu-Ag while keeping cost low and electrical conductivity high, we lowered Ag content and added Sc. After aging treatment, our doped Cu-3 wt%Ag-0.3 wt% Sc contained exclusively continuous Ag precipitates, as opposed to exclusively discontinuous Ag precipitates in non-doped Cu-3 wt%Ag. After deformation at a low level of strain, electrical conductivity was almost the same in doped and non-doped samples, but Sc doping significantly improved hardness by suppressing formation of discontinuous Ag precipitates.

AB Alleviating volume expansion of the electrodes and improving utilization of the active materials have become key problems restricting a successful commercialization of lithium-selenium batteries. In this paper, a 2D ultrathin carbon nanosheets derived from interconnected MOF is designed for the first time. Such carbon nanosheets are composed by parallel stacked 2D sub-units, and this unique hierarchical porous architecture is beneficial for buffering the volume expansion and for improving the utilization rate of the active materials. Therefore, the cathode displays an excellent cycling stability with a reversible capacity of 347.3 mAh g(-1) al 2 C after 240 cycles. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier B.V.

ID PERFORMANCE
AB Thin vanadium pentoxide (V2O5) layers were grown on porous nitrogen-doped-graphene (NG) nanosheets via atomic layer deposition (ALD). The fabricated NG-V2O5 (NG-V) composite electrodes exhibited a good electrochemical performance when used as anodes for lithium-ion batteries (LIBs), which can be attributed to strong chemical bonding between V2O5 and NG substrates and the porous structure of NG, which gives the material an excellent electron- and ion-transport ability. In particular, at a current density of 200 and 1000 mAg(-1), the NG-V electrodes showed good capacity retention and high discharge capacities of 608 (after 50 cycles) and 365 mAhg(-1) (after 500 cycles), respectively, based on the total electrode.

ID HETEROJUNCTION; DEGRADATION
AB Various NiO/ZnO heterostructures have been prepared by a facile solvothermal method combined with subsequent calcination process. By adjusting the adding proportion of Ni/Zn, the superior performance in photocatalytic degradation of tetracycline (TC) can be achieved in porous NiO/ZnO flower-like microstructures consisting of interlaced nanosheet/particle framework. Compared with NiO hollow microspheres, flower-like NiO/ZnO samples exhibit the enhanced photocatalytic performance with high efficiency of 92% within 30 min as well as good photocatalytic cycle stability to TC, which is mainly ascribed to the combination of larger specific surface area (162.1 m(2)/g), unique surface/interface effect, faster electron/hole separation, and higher electron transmission. This work paves the way for other oxide composites applied as novel photocatalysts based on the design and construction of interlaced nanosheet/particle heterostructures. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

ID GRAIN-BOUNDARIES; BEHAVIOR; PHASE
AB The microstructural evolution and matrix-carbide load transfer in a nickel-based alloy (GH3535) under tension were investigated by in situ high-energy X-ray diffraction. The sample containing smaller carbides (1-3 mu m) shows obvious load transfer from the matrix to the carbides during the initial elastic deformation. However, the sample with larger carbides (10-20 mu m) shows no remarkable load-transfer behavior. The sample with smaller carbides possesses slightly higher yield strength and lower ultimate tensile strength than the sample with larger carbides. These results are attributed to indirect strengthening by dislocation obstruction in the sample with larger carbides and direct strengthening via load transfer for that with smaller carbides.

AB In this study, Fe0.04Co0.96Sb3 nanopowder was synthesized using radio frequency induction plasma, starting from mechanically milled Fe, Co, and Sb powders. The as-synthesized powder was found to contain CoSb3, FeSb2, CoSb, and elemental Sb. Annealing of the synthesized powder at 600 degrees C for 12 h under argon atmosphere increased the fraction of CoSb3. Spark plasma sintering of the annealed powder was carried out at 625 degrees C under 60 MPa pressure for fabrication into bulk nanostructured material. Thermal conductivity (k) of disks thus fabricated was found to be 1.78 +/- 0.16 W/m.K at room temperature, which is significantly lesser than its microcrystalline counterpart (5.58 +/- 0.60 W/m.K). Such a reduction in k could mainly be attributed to the enhanced phonon scattering occurring at the grain boundaries and interfaces present in the bulk nanostructured Fe0.04Co0.96Sb3 sample, which is an added advantage for its use in the thermoelectric devices.

AB Light absorption properties are one of the most important characteristics of semiconductor materials, since it is related to particle size, electric resistance, powder density, and dielectric constant. Barium hexaferrite (BaFe12O19) particles were synthesized by ceramic and chemical co-precipitation method. Light absorption properties were studied in relation to the particle size, morphology, and surface porosity. The band gap was calculated by the Kubelka-Munk method from the obtained experimental absorption spectrum. Band gap energies of 1.82 and 1.86 eV were estimated for the particles synthesized by the ceramic method and for the co-precipitation method respectively. The results show that both synthesized BaFe12O19 samples can be effectively excited with visible light irradiation. In addition to this, due to its other good characteristics such as its magnetic properties, high resistance to corrosion, and chemical stability, make the barium hexaferrite an excellent material for diverse technological applications.

AB Herein, we report a new castable nanostructured alloy (CNA), which was first melted in a vacuum induction furnace to introduce micron- and submicron-sized inclusions, strengthened by the multiscale secondary phases for fusion reactors. The large micron-scale inclusions are removed, whereas submicron-scale inclusions were retained during an electroslag remelting process. The ingot was subjected to heat treatment at 1050 degrees C for 0.5 h followed by heating at 650 degrees C for 1.5 h to obtain tempered martensite along with the nanosized (Ti, W) carbides. The improvement in the mechanical properties of the sample treated at 750 degrees C was attributed to the removal of blocky Y-rich inclusions along with the strengthening of the submicron-sized Y2O3 oxides. The performance of the sample treated at 650 degrees C was explained by the precipitation of the fine (Ti, W) carbides. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Bi5O7I nanosheets and Bi5O7I nanorods photocatalysts were successfully fabricated by calcination and hydrothermal methods respectively. The different morphologies of Bi5O7I were characterized by XRD, SEM, HRTEM, UV-vis DRS and PL. The as-prepared samples were used to photocatalytic removal of Hg-O under visible-light irradiation. The results indicated that the photocatalytic activity of Bi5O7I nanorods is better than that of Bi5O7I nanosheets. It can be attributed to the synergistic and internal electric field effects of the (0 0 1) and (1 0 0) facets of Bi5O7I nanorods, which improves the photogenerated charge transfer and separation efficiency.

AB Laser engineered net shaping (LENS (TM)), a metal additive manufacturing process, was employed to repair internal defects in Inconel 718. The technique involves milling slot/s around defect zone and subsequently refill the cavities with a material. This study investigates the effectiveness of two slots with different geometric shapes, rectangular and trapezoidal, to repair internal cracks and understand the influence of deposition orientation on mechanical properties of the repaired components. Trapezoidal shaped cross-section showed good fusion between deposit material and the part along the sidewalls without any void inclusion. Build-direction, especially diagonal-deposition, influenced coefficient of friction and compound-wear for non-heat-treated samples. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this article, high-energy electro-pulsing treatment is executed on DP600 steel to avoid the formation of discontinuous martensites or eutectoid region under traditional annealing treatment. It's found that compared with traditional treatment, the a/a grain boundaries are more fully wetted by refined martensites or eutectoid carbides in electro-pulsing treated samples. Moreover, on account of this special microstructure, more compatible deformation characteristics and better mechanical properties of DP600 steel are also acquired by electro-pulsing with 360 ms. This interesting finding offers an efficient treating method for dual phase steel towards higher properties from the viewpoint of structure-performance relationship. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

ID ENHANCEMENT
AB The efficiency of organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) deposited on flat substrates is strongly limited by the total internal reflection at the air-substrate interface. An effective strategy to reduce the amount of substrate modes and enhance the light out-coupling into the air is attaching a microlens array (MLA) on the external surface of OLEDs. In this study, polymeric MLA with periods between 1.2 mu m and 2.0 mu m are patterned by plate-to-plate nano-imprint lithography using metallic stamps structured by direct laser interference patterning. When MLA with a spatial period of 2.0 mu m and a structure depth of 200 nm are employed on red, green and blue OLEDs, the external quantum efficiency is increased to 11.4%, 6.6% and 12.7%, respectively, due to a reduction of internally reflected radiation at the air-MLA-glass interfaces.

The prepared photocatalysts were characterized by field emission scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, energy dispersive spectrometer, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy X-ray diffraction spectra, UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller. The photocatalytic efficiency of Bi2MoO6/Ag/AgCl was evaluated by the degradation of RB-19 dye. Results indicated that Bi2MoO6/Ag/AgCl photocatalyst exhibited higher photocatalytic activity than Bi2MoO6. Simultaneously, h(+) was confirmed to be the most important active species in degradation of RB-19 by free radical and hole trapping experiment, proposing a potential photocatalytic mechanism.

AB Polydopamine (PDA) is a biopolymer inspired by the mussel chemistry. Due to its capability to bind various metal-ions, PDA has been explored in several potential applications including absorbents for heavy metal contaminants and templates for nanoparticle growth. In this study, metal-ion-containing PDA was prepared by introducing Cu, Ni, and Co cations during synthesis. We discovered that nanoparticles (NPs) formed under intense electron beam irradiation. For Cu-containing PDA, both equiaxed NPs and rod-like nanocrystals were observed. In contrast, Ni and Co NPs were mainly equiaxed with smaller diameters. The formation of metal NPs is likely a result of electron beam induced reduction. We also demonstrated that electron beam could induce growth of Cu NPs on the surface of PDA-coated SiO2 particles. This result suggested that PDA coating could be used as a platform to grow metal NPs on ceramics and potentially other substrates. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID METAL-ORGANIC-FRAMEWORKS; SURFACE-AREA; HIGH-YIELD
AB MIL-100(Cr), as a typical metal organic framework (MOF) possesses a great potential application for N-2 removal from CH4 by physical adsorption, but the commonly used preparation process at present is time-consuming (96 h) and environmentally unfriendly (HF-needed). We developed a novel synthesis method which is able to prepare MIL-100(Cr) via steam-assisted conversion and avoids the usage of HF with a curtate reaction time (9 h) and excellent yield (96%), a higher selectivity of N-2 from CH4. Obviously, this method is advantageous and suitable for green large-scale production of MIL-100(Cr). (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB There is strong clinical need for a class of materials compatible with all common medical imaging modalities including Magnetic Resonance Imaging and X-Ray Computed Tomography which provide minimum attenuation to high intensity X-Ray photons used in Radiotherapy treatment, to improve patient outcomes and recovery times. In this work, we present a new natural fibre composite comprising wood pulp derived fibres embedded in polyester resin and bonded to expanded polystyrene cores. The resulting structure is demonstrated to have low visibility on Magnetic Resonance Imaging, X-Ray megavoltage imaging and Computed Tomography and to be less attenuating to radiotherapy photons than the commonly used carbon fibre or glass fibre reinforced composite materials. It is anticipated that this new material will facilitate improved radiotherapy planning and thus treatment outcomes. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

It was found that reasonable hydrogen content can significantly improve the strength at 550 degrees C of dehydrogenated Ti-55 alloy after superplastic tension. Compared with as-received one, the yield strength and ultimate tensile strength of 0.5 wt%H-dehydrogenated specimen are increased by 35.6% and 33.9%, respectively. This results from the microstructural refinement and dislocation strengthening by thermohydrogen processing. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Acoustic emission of nanocrystalline superelastic NiTi alloys with different grain sizes (GS) of 10 nm, 60 nm and 235 nm during fatigue crack growth is investigated. The acoustic emission responses among the three characteristic regimes of fatigue crack growth exhibit significant differences for all GS specimens. Such differences due to the increase of elastic wave emission with the driving force reveal the correlation between acoustic emission responses and fatigue crack growth. The total accumulated acoustic energy (AAE) over the whole fatigue process is monotonically decreased by more than 10 times when the GS is decreased from 235 nm to 10 nm. Such significant decrease in AAE originates from the rapid decrease of elastic wave emission induced by phase transition, martensite variants evolution and dislocation motion with GS reduction. The work suggests a nondestructive approach to monitor the damage of NiTi in practical applications. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Improving the corrosion resistance of Mg alloys is essential for broadening its application. In this paper, the aluminum silicate-modified Ni-Al layered double hydroxides (LDHs) were synthesized by co-precipitation, and then the aluminum silicate-modified Ni-Al LDHs film was fabricated on the surface of AZ31 Mg alloy to improve the anti-corrosion property via a facile in-situ growth method. The results showed that the aluminum silicate modified Ni-Al LDHs film could effectively improve the corrosion resistance of AZ31 Mg alloy and could maintain for a long time. Comparing to that of the bare AZ31 Mg alloy, the corrosion current density of the one with the aluminum silicate modified Ni-Al LDHs film was decreased by 2 orders of magnitude. It was due to the blocking effect of the aluminum silicate modified on the Ni-Al LDHs and the adsorption of Cl- by the LDHs film, delaying the corrosion of the Mg alloys. This work not only broadens the modification method of LDHs but also provides a new strategy for the corrosion protection of Mg alloys. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier B.V.

SO MATERIALS LETTERS

DE IUD; Electropolymer; Coating; Copper; Burst release
ID INTRAUTERINE-DEVICES; INDOMETHACIN
AB Copper bearing IUDs main disadvantage is the initial high release (burst release) of copper ions that causes an increased inflammatory response in surrounding tissues and several side effects. In this work, we studied the performance of Cu coated with an electropolymer obtained by potentiostatic polarization of a phytocompound, carvacrol, at 400 mV (SCE) (polyCarvCu-400 mV) in simulated intrauterine fluid (SUF) and its biocompatibility in a fibroblastic cell line. Corrosion studies with polyCarvCu-400 mV revealed a 107 +/- 5 mV anodic shift of corrosion potential and an important decrease in corrosion current. PolyCarvCu-400 mV immersed in SUF for 3 and 15 days also evidenced a drastic reduction in the release of copper ions with respect to bare copper. Notwithstanding, concentrations of released copper (4.6-9.2 mu g/day during the first 3 days and 2.0-4.00 mu g/day during 15 days) are enough to guarantee the contraception action. PolyCarvCu-400 mV also showed a higher biocompatibility than bare Cu when fibroblast cell viability was assayed and, additionally, an enhanced cell growth on the metal surface than untreated copper. Results indicate that polyCarvCu-400 mV coating provides excellent improvements related to untreated Cu-bearing IUDs, avoiding the burst release side effects and enhancing the biocompatibility of the device.

AB We hereby report the fabrication and performance of a blended polymer film made up by PVC & PVA for thin layer chromatography. PVC/PVA thin films were prepared by non-solvent induced phase separation (NIPS) method. They were characterized by Fourier-Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR), Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy (FE-SEM) & Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC). FTIR analysis indicated the existence of residual PVA content within the PVC matrix and FE-SEM revealed the formation of finger like pores with voids in between them. DSC analysis proved the miscibility of the components viz; PVA and PVC. Equilibrium water content (EWC) and contact angle measurements showed that hydrophilicity of the films depends on the weight percentage of PVA. The porosity, hydrophilicity and adhesion of the PVC/PVA films enabled them to be used as TLC sheets for the separation of carotene and chlorophyll from Red bead tree (Adenanthera pavonina) leaf extract. Out of the different compositions studied, it was found that thin films with PVA content up to 8 wt% showed better separation of plant pigments using mixture of ether and acetone as developing solvent.

AB Surface gradient nanostructuring was performed on the friction stir welded joints of high strength AlZnMgCu alloy by means of surface mechanical rolling treatment (SMRT). Uniaxial symmetric tension-tension fatigue tests (R = 0.1) showed that two orders of magnitude extension in fatigue lifetime was achieved on the FSW joint of the AlZnMgCu alloy, exhibiting the transition of fatigue crack initiation mode from surface to interior. The enhanced fatigue mechanism was discussed based on the measured in-depth distribution hardness and compress residual stress, as well as the observed microstructure modifications.

AB Copper (Cu) matrix composites reinforced by graphene nanoplates (GNPs) were prepared through electrostatic self-assembly and electroless Cu plating. GNPs were uniformly adsorbed on the surface of flake Cu powders by electrostatic self-assembly, and then, GNPs were coated with a layer of Cu nanoparticles using electroless Cu plating. The coating of GNPs on Cu nanoparticles is used to enhance both the interfacial wettability of GNPs with Cu powders and the interface bonding strength of them by the formation of oxygen-mediated group. The tensile tests shown that the yield strength and ultimate tensile strength of the GNPs/Cu composites with Cu plating were higher than those of GNPs/Cu composites without Cu plating.

AB Manufacturing of bimetallic structure from titanium (Ti-) to nickel (Ni-) based alloys has a specific interest in reducing the structure weight and making full use of individual excellent properties of the two kind metals. However, due to large differences in physical and chemical properties between the two metals, the laser deposition manufacturing (LDM) of Ti-/Ni-based alloys cannot avoid the cracking and brittle failure at the bond zone. In this work, the low-cost copper (Cu) was used as the bond layers for LDM of two model alloys TA15 and inconel 718 (IN718). Results showed that the Cu interlayer was very useful to eliminate the cracking and obtain a plastic transit between TA15 and IN718. Metallurgical bonds can also be achieved at the interfaces of the two alloys. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Graphene with a porous structure can provide low-resistant pathways and short ion diffusion channels for energy storage, and thus is expected to be an excellent electrode material. Here, a simple partial combustion route was used to synthesize porous graphene with controllable pore size as a high-performance electrode material for supercapacitors. The results indicated that the obtained porous graphene exhibits the highest specific capacitance in this study is 284 F/g at the current density of 0.2 A/g in 6 M KOH. Moreover, porous graphene showed good cycle durability over 83% at the current density of 1.0 A/g after 5000 cycles, and with columbic efficiency over 95%. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Crowdsourcing challenges are fast emerging as an effective tool for solving complex innovation problems. The main strength of the crowdsourcing model is that it brings together a large number of diverse people from all over the world to focus on solving a problem. This openness, however, results in a large number of solutions that are not appropriate, and this inhibits organizations from leveraging the value of crowdsourcing efficiently and effectively. It is therefore essential to identify ways to increase the appropriateness of solutions generated in a crowdsourcing challenge. This paper takes a step towards that by exploring what motivates the crowd to participate in these challenges and how these motivations relate to solution appropriateness. Drawing on data from InnoCentive, one of the largest .crowdsourcing platforms for innovation problems, this paper shows that the various types of motivation driving crowd members to participate were related in different ways to the appropriateness of the solutions generated. In particular, intrinsic and extrinsic motivation were positively related to appropriateness whereas for learning and prosocial motivation the relationship was negative. The association between social motivation and appropriateness was not significant. The results have important implications for how to better design crowdsourcing challenges.

AB With the process of digitalization now in full swing, many are wondering how the adoption of new technologies influences job creation and destruction. Much hinges upon the specific tasks that machines take on and how many new tasks are created through the adoption of new digital technologies. Some argue that most tasks that are at risk of automation are those performed by rather low- to medium-skilled employees, while most new tasks that emerge from the adoption of digital technologies complement high-skilled labor. We present evidence derived from representative survey data from Switzerland that is consistent with this view. Specifically, we find that increased investment in digitalization is associated with increased employment of high-skilled workers and reduced employment of low-skilled workers, with a slightly positive net effect. The main effects are almost entirely driven by firms that employ machine-based digital technologies, e.g. robots, 3D printing or the Internet of Things. We do not find any significant employment effects when non-machine-based digital technologies are considered, e.g. ERP, e-commerce or cooperation support systems.

AB Innovation is a cumulative process in which past knowledge created by others can be both a source for predictable outcomes and also a barrier to significant change. The recent literature on digital innovation suggests that open platforms, which encourage their developers to build upon each other's knowledge when innovating their add-on apps in the periphery, face a related paradox. Developers face the tension of either being coherent with the past, or flexible to adjust to the future. In this paper, we examine how the trade-off between coherent and flexible search mechanisms affects the individual developer's choice of innovating a certain app as well as his or her cumulative impact, i.e., the degree of modifications to the app. We study an open platform in the multi-disciplinary field of nanotechnology, in which 480 developers perform more than 30,000 problem-solving actions over a period of 10 years. We use relational event modeling to differentially assess the effect of the coherent and flexible search strategies. We find that developers are significantly more likely to choose a certain app that is consistent with both a coherent and flexible strategy. However, a coherent strategy leads to greater cumulative impact on an app compared to a strategy of being mutually coherent and flexible. Thus, our findings indicate both a complementary and a contradictory logic in how the tension between coherence and flexibility unfolds. We make contributions to the recent literature on digital innovation as well as the innovation literature more broadly. Further, our results inform innovation policy and platform design.

AB This paper examines for the first time dual-class equity crowdfunding as a digital ownership model. Unique to this context, companies can set an investment threshold under which no voting rights are granted, making the issuance of Class A vs. Class B shares, depending on individual investors. Using a sample of 491 offerings on the UK platform Crowdcube from 2011 to 2015, we find that a higher separation between ownership and control rights lowers the probability of success of the offering, the likelihood of attracting professional investors, as well as the long-run prospects. Different from small investors, professional investors care about the implementation of a threshold for the attribution of voting rights and often bid the Class A threshold exactly. Family businesses, although less attractive to small investors, are relatively safer investments, because of their lower chances of failure.

AB Involving customers is often considered a method to develop products in line with market needs. However, we still need to obtain more insights into the respective drivers and outcomes in the context of (a) the involvement of customers by entrepreneurial ventures and (b) business-to-consumer (B2C) relationships. This study suggests that reward-based crowdfunding can provide a digital opportunity for both areas. We explore how community-derived social capital influences ventures' approach to engaging backers in new product development and how this, in turn, advances product innovativeness. Using structural equation modeling, we test a unique dataset that combines primary survey and secondary platform data from 710 crowdfunding ventures. Our results provide a nuanced picture of how social capital dimensions are associated with backers as an information source and as codevelopers and, indirectly, with new product innovativeness. This study underscores that crowdfunding serves as a digital platform for market-oriented innovation. It contributes empirical insights into how nascent teams can engage the digital crowd in product development via crowdfunding. We also add to social capital literature by illuminating web-mediated mechanisms that transform knowledge into tangible innovation outcomes.

AB Under what conditions does digital technology adoption increase cross location knowledge flows within firms? We investigate this question by studying the impact of adopting basic Internet access on cross-location knowledge flows within the same firm. We construct a large data set of Internet adoption and patent citations among dyadic pairs of firm-locations between 1992-1998. We find that when both locations in the pair adopt basic Internet there is an increase in the likelihood of a citation between the citing and (potential) cited location. In contrast, we find no significant effect of Internet adoption at only the citing location. We further study how this effect varies according to the proximity of the research activities between the source and recipient of knowledge and specialization of the research activities within the recipient. We find that the likelihood of a citation increases more after dyadic Internet adoption when the pair is working in similar research areas and when the research areas in the citing location are less specialized. These results, which are robust to a range of robustness analyses, suggest that digital technologies such as Internet connectivity are able to facilitate knowledge flows between locations only when they share a common knowledge base.

AB Innovators and entrepreneurs developing products and competing "on top" of digital platforms face different conditions than do those in more traditional industries. In this paper, we explore how this affects appropriability strategies in novel data on mobile app developers' appropriability strategies. We find that the many smallest developers in the "long tail"- the vast majority of all developers - do in fact take actions to capture value and to protect their intellectual property, but do so only through informal mechanisms. By contrast, larger developers exploit a combination of both informal mechanisms and formal intellectual property rights, using copyright, patents, and trademarks. Several strategies particular to digital platforms are also documented. We link this pattern of different strategies pursued by different competitor types to the structural features of digital competition.
