AB The effect of fiber alignment on particle collection performance of mechanical/electret filters are investigated numerically. Four sets of fiber networks, namely, nearly isotropic, aligned, highly aligned and layered orientations are constructed using Voronoi tessellations. The particle transport and deposition process in these fiber networks under the coupling of flow field and electrostatic field are modeled using hybrid lattice Boltzmann Lagrangian method. The particle collection efficiencies and pressure drops of the mechanical/electret filters are calculated and compared. Results indicate that the mechanical filter with layered networks has the best filtration performance for large particles, and then the aligned networks has the next best performance. However, the sequence reverses when filtering the nanoparticles. In contrast to a mechanical filter, the electret filter with isotropic networks exhibits the best performance for full range of particles size, indicating that the dielectric attraction is less impacted by the 3D fiber orientations. Increasing fibers orientations in the airflow direction and constructing 3D pores of high sphericity are recommended to improve the performance of an electret filter. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

TI Adsorption and structure of benzene, toluene, and p-xylene in carbon

AB The adsorption of benzene (B), toluene (T), and p-xylene (X) at ambient temperature in carbon slit pores was studied using the grand canonical Monte Carlo simulation. We focused on how the structure of the adsorbed B, T, and X molecules is influenced by pore size, in particular the effects of the methyl groups in the cases of toluene and p-xylene. The packing density of the compounds in the pores was found to follow the order B < T < X at low loadings but X < T < B at high loadings. Furthermore, various molecular orientations were observed in the different pore sizes, including parallel, perpendicular, and parallel combined with perpendicular, and the nearest neighboring molecules assumed to undergo an edge-wise or T-shaped interaction. For parallel molecules, two adjacent molecules were aligned in an edge-wise interaction, which is the most favorable for solid-fluid interactions. However, for perpendicular molecules, two adjacent molecules were arranged in a T-shape, which is more favorable for fluid-fluid interactions. For the perpendicular toluene and p-xylene molecules, the angle between the methyl group and the pore walls was found to be 30 degrees. In the smallest pore studied, the benzene molecules were found to adopt a 2D hexagonally packed solid-like state, whereas the toluene and p-xylene molecules were in a liquid-like state. Consequently, the microscopic structures of B, T, X in various sized pores were investigated. The molecular models showed that the fluid-fluid interactions were significant for B, T, X adsorption, except for the cases of toluene and p-xylene in pores that can accommodate more than one molecular layer, where the solid-fluid interactions play a more dominant role because of the enhanced solid-fluid interactions of the toluene and p-xylene molecules oriented in parallel to each other. In addition, we have compared the results of our simulation with experimental data from previous research. The simulated isotherm agrees reasonably well with the experimentally obtained isotherm, and the simulated nearest-neighbor distance between the adsorbed molecules is almost the same as the experimental value.

AB In the present paper, computational fluid dynamic (CFD) model was applied to simulate for the first time a synergetic application of a hybrid plasma and catalyst comprising DOC (Diesel Oxidation Catalyst) with Pt/CeO2 -Al2O3 and SCR (Selective Catalytic Reaction) with V2O5/TiO2. Plasma-catalytic can be used in cold start diesel engine exhaust to reduce pollutants when catalyst is not hot enough. Plasma system was a pulsed corona consisting of the coaxial wire-cylinder reactor. NOx and C3H6  reduction, NO2, NO, and radical produced concentration dependence of the electric field intensity were achieved. Transient temperature and CO distribution at catalyst channel, catalyst back pressure, and NO distribution all over the CC (catalytic converter) concentration were investigated to determine the steady state reduction efficiency of NO, CO, CH4, and C3H6 with respect to inlet velocities and temperatures. In velocity 3 m/s, temperature 600 K, highest electric field before sparkover at 17 kV/cm, and 80 s engine cold start time, the reduction efficiencies of NO and C3H6 got about 9% and 99% respectively. In steady state condition CO, NO, and C3H6 reduction in catalyst are about 98%, 29%, and 95% in order. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Solute partition in multiphase fluids is an important thermodynamic phenomenon and performance attribute for a wide range of product formulations of foods, pharmaceuticals and cosmetics. Experimental evaluation of partition coefficients in complex product formulations is empirical, difficult and time consuming. In-silico methods such as fragment constant method and group contribution method require parameter fitting to the experimental data and are limited to relatively simple fluids. Recently, a method combining molecular dynamics (MD) and quantum chemical (QC) calculation of screening charge density function has been reported. The method does not only use fundamental properties of intermolecular force and charge density function, which does not require parameter fitting to the experimental data, but also applies to complex fluid structures such as micelles. In this work, the predictive accuracy of the combined method of MD and QC is evaluated. Using widely available octanol-water partition coefficients as a case study, the performance of the combined MD and COSMOmic for predicting octanol/water partition coefficients has been compared with those of the EPI Suite' fragment constant method, UNIFAC group contribution method and COSMOtherm. The prediction of the combined MD/COSMOmic method is the closest to the best performing fragment constant method which was specifically designed for the octanol-water system. The combined MD/QC method proves to be the most promising and robust method applicable to a wide range of complex structures of multiphase fluid systems. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB A two-fluid model in the Eulerian-Eulerian framework has been implemented for the turbulent gas-liquid bubbly upward flow in a vertical pipe. The transport equations, i.e. Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes equations for the two-fluid model, are discretized using the finite volume method. The effect of the disperse gas phase on the liquid phase turbulence, referred to as turbulence modulation, was accounted for through source terms in the transport equations for a low Reynolds number k - epsilon turbulence closure. The model was used to predict the turbulence kinetic energy and its dissipation rate, mean phasic velocities and volume fraction distribution for a set of test cases selected from the available literature. The focus of the present study was on assessing the model predictions using measurements of the turbulence kinetic energy of the liquid phase. A relatively novel aspect of the present analysis is the use of the budgets of the transport equations for the turbulence kinetic energy and dissipation rate to assess the effect of the turbulence modulation on the liquid turbulence field. Although the present model formulation is shown to adequately predict the effect of bubbles in some flows and perform better than some of the other model formulations, the overall conclusion is that the present approaches for incorporating turbulence modulation are at best partially successful and still need further development.

AB We have developed a direct measurement method for the breakage of droplet swarm in our previous work. However, experimental data for droplet breakage is still extremely indispensable for the development and employment of population balance model (PBM). In this paper, the direct measurement of droplet breakage for a series of liquid-liquid systems has been carried out in a pulsed disc and doughnut column (PDDC) to meet the requirement. The data together with that in our previous work cover the main factors affecting the droplet breakage in the PDDC and are sufficient to support the establishment of useful empirical correlations for breakup frequency and daughter droplet size distribution. The experimental results and correlations all indicate that the breakup frequency function increases as the dispersed-phase viscosity or the interfacial tension decreases. The daughter droplet size distribution broadens considerably with decreasing interfacial tension. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Adsorption and desorption of acetone and ethyl acetate (two typical oxygenated VOCs) on silica gel have been systematically studied by vacuum swing adsorption (VSA) combined with temperature swing adsorption (TSA) process. It is found that the adsorption of both the oxygenated VOC compounds on silica gel could be well described by the Langmuir-Freundlich model. Although highly dependent on the operational parameters, the adsorption of both the oxygenated VOC compounds on silica gel is found to be controlled by external diffusion. When the two compounds are mixed, the adsorbed acetone is found to be partially replaced by the ethyl acetate when the adsorption approaches the saturation due to the stronger affinity of ethyl acetate to silica gel. It also suggests that there is a competitive adsorption between ethyl acetate and acetone. Further modeling demonstrates that the whole kinetic adsorption of binary oxygenated components could be divided into three steps: the free adsorption, the competitive adsorption and the equilibrium state. The final ratio of adsorbed acetone to ethyl acetate on silica gel is dependent on the adsorption bed height. The adsorbed oxygenated VOCs on silica gel are observed to be desorbed by vacuum pumping, which is also found to be significantly enhanced by increasing temperature (by similar to 30 degrees C), achieving over 2.5 times of concentration increase in the desorbed gas stream.

AB In this experimental study results reveal the formation of miniaturized surface morphologies over a soft thin elastic film of micron range thickness (h), when cast on various patterned substrates created from: naturally available intrinsically rough water lily leaves, commercially available sinusoidally patterned compact disks and cubic boxes created by electron beam lithography. The evolving surface patterns formed had varying structures of columns to labyrinth to cavities during the adhesion and debonding cycle, irrespective of which the engendered dominant wavelength (lambda) remained at a minuscule length scale that was found to be much less than that obtained on flat substrates. It was observed experimentally that the length scales of the patterns formed decreased linearly with increase in substrate amplitude and regardless of the substrate pattern geometry used depended solely on its RMS roughness such that lambda/h = 2.96-18.2*(RMS/h). The study indicates the redundancy in creating very costly regular geometrical patterned substrates for miniaturization and instead advocates the use of intrinsically rough natural surface replicas to be used as patterned substrates for cost-effective fabrication of miniaturized surface patterns at such soft interfaces.

AB Slug injection of CO2/N-2 has proven to be a promising technology for the enhancement of oil recovery in low/ultra-low permeability reservoirs. In spite of this, the detailed displacement process and interaction mechanisms remain unclear. Adopting molecular dynamic simulations, the displacement behavior of CO2/N-2 flooding was investigated at the molecular and atomic level. It was found that CO2 and N-2 play varying roles: the solubility of CO2 is strong, and the propel effect of N-2 provides an obvious advantage. Furthermore, the synergistic effect of the CO2 slug and N-2 slug was found to be better than single phase injection and even better than mixture gas (flue gas) flooding. Particularly, it shows the best displacement efficiency when CO2 is used as a front slug. This study unveils the underlying mechanism of gas flooding in low permeability reservoirs, and the results may be proved helpfully in providing theoretical support for the optimization of the injection mode.

AB We used supercritical ethylene as both a solvent and reactant for ethylene oligomerization over silica-alumina catalysts with different pore structures and decorated with Ni nanoparticles namely Ni-H beta and Ni-Al-SBA-15. The catalysts were characterized by electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, nitrogen physisorption, and Fourier transformed infrared spectroscopy. The effect of pressure and temperature on the overall conversion and product selectivity over Ni-H beta were evaluated in the range from 0.0 to 52.5 bar (partial pressure of ethylene) and 30 to 120 degrees C. At subcritical conditions over Ni-H beta (120 degrees C and 11.2/22.4 bar), the ethylene conversion reached a plateau of around 50% after six hours. By increasing the pressure past the critical point of ethylene, the steady-state conversion significantly increased to 71%. The drastic increase in conversion can be attributed to the high butene and hexene solubilities in supercritical ethylene, promoting the desorption of di- and trimerization products from the catalytic active sites and making those sites available for incoming ethylene molecules. At supercritical conditions, high ethylene conversion (85%) and C4 selectivity (74%) was achieved using Ni-Al-SBA-15 (impregnated mesoporous catalyst), while Ni-H beta (the microporous catalyst) yielded less C4 (32 wt%) and more C6 (22 wt%) possibly because of confinement effects of the micropore channels. We also examined the influence of the reaction temperature over Ni-H beta. The catalytic activity increased with temperature from 30 to 120 degrees C. Even though there was little activity at 30 degrees C for ethylene oligomerization, the solvation abilities at this condition provide opportunities for in-situ removal of heavy molecular weight species from the catalyst for regeneration purposes, provided that the catalyst does not strongly adsorb ethylene molecules at low temperature. This work shows for the first time that supercritical ethylene conditions have great potential for practical catalytic applications. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The paper proposes an original algorithm which allows a long time scale extrapolation of DEM results at a very low computational cost. This algorithm can be adapted to any periodic processes. In this study, it is applied to the mixing process of powders within a conical screw mixer. The results are then compared with long time DEM simulations. It appears that this method is able to predict the DEM results with a very good accuracy. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Surrogate-based optimization of distillation columns using an iterative Kriging approach is investigated. To avoid suboptimal local minima the focus lies on deterministic global optimization. The determination of optimal setups and operating conditions for ideal and non-ideal distillation columns, leading to mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problems, serve as case studies. To cope with output multiplicities of the model an implicit surrogate formulation is proposed. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The drag and lift forces were particularly studied. The inclination of the plate varies between 0 degrees and 90 degrees. The inertia of the fluid is considered negligible. The effects of the Oldroyd number, the shear-thinning index and the inclination of the plate on drag and lift are shown. Experimentally, an instrumented flume was used with a Carbopol gel as a yield stress fluid model. The measured lift and drag forces are compared to the numerical results and the literature data. The elasticity and plasticity effects are discussed. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID BUBBLE BREAKUP; MICROCHANNEL; PLUGS
AB Dynamics of the three breakup regimes of droplets in an asymmetric bifurcation is experimentally studied by a high-speed microscope system and a micro-particle image velocimetry (mu PIV) system. Effects of the droplet length and the capillary number on the evolution of the neck thickness are analyzed. For droplets that obstruct the microchannel, the pressure drop across the droplet during the breakup process is theoretically calculated and its relationship with the neck shrinkage is discussed. Based on mass conservation law, the theoretical prediction on the geometric shape of droplets can be constructed and both the radius of droplet rear cap and the neck thickness agree well with experimental results. It is proven that the theoretical model could also be successfully constructed for asymmetric bifurcations and the model in this paper could be applied to bifurcations with arbitrary angles. If gaps are present between the droplet and channel sidewalls, it is found that the thinning process of the neck and variations of the flow field of droplets are distinctly different from the obstructed breakup. For no breakup regime, the vortex flow accompanies the backflow of the droplet tip and two different vortex distributions within the droplet are disclosed for the first time, which are separated by the droplet length. The critical neck thickness that determines whether droplets break after flowing through the bifurcation is revealed and compared with other works. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Through experimental measurement and theoretical calculation, we have investigated the effect of surface tension, liquid viscosity and the capillary geometry (capillary gradient and tip diameter) on the effective pore throat, and the impact of the effective pore throat on pore resistance to two-phase interfaces formed from fluids with different viscosities and surface tensions. When a two-phase interface flows in channels with varied pore diameter, capillary force is insignificant in the section of the channel with an inner pore diameter greater than the effective pore throat, and the pressure drops in this section depend on capillary tip diameter, rather than the surface tension. Capillary force takes significant effect on the interface only when the pore diameter in a tapered capillary is smaller than the effective pore throat. Effective pore throat depends on fluid surface tension and the capillary geometry, but not on liquid viscosity. The higher the fluid surface tension, the larger the diameter of the effective pore throat. A channel with a large tip diameter or gradient will give a large effective pore throat diameter. Fluid viscosity only affects the magnitude of the resistant pressure drops of fluid flows in constricted capillaries, but does not affect the effective pore throat diameter. The effective pore throat and the pressure profile measured in this study can be explained by the pore contact angle, but cannot be explained by the contact angle on a flat surface of the same materials.

AB For a single isolated particle, the effect of overlap displacement on conduction and the effect of particle diameter/fluid velocity on convection are comprehensively studied using a CFD-DEM method coupled with heat exchange. Moreover, the model is further validated in a pseudo-2D bubbling fluidized bed and the influence of operating parameters (i.e., fluid velocity, particle diameter, and mass loading) on heat transfer contribution is deeply revealed. The results show that the fluid velocity and particle diameter have a more remarkable influence on convective heat transfer than conductive heat transfer. Besides, the particle-fluid convection dominates the heat transfer while the particle-particle conduction is almost negligible. The particle-fluid-particle conduction occupies about 10% of the total heat transfer. Finally, the model is successfully applied in a circulating fluidized bed. The average mass fractions of solid materials in the riser, cyclone, and dipleg are 0.737, 0.023, and 0.240, respectively. Solid internal circulations and lower solid velocities in the horizontal part of dipleg lead to a two-peak histogram distribution of particles temperature in the riser and the system.

AB In this work, gas maldistribution in random packings of cylinders and Raschig rings is studied with particle-resolved direct numerical simulation (PRDNS) employing a finite volume solver for Cartesian grids and the immersed boundary method for the treatment of complex geometries. The geometry of the random packed bed has been obtained in a separate simulation based on a sequential deposition of particles in a cylindrical column and a simplified mechanics with additional radial force allowing for higher packing densities. The first part of the work focuses on comparison of the packings of cylinders and rings with respect to their ability to distribute the flow uniformly over the cross-section of the column when the gas in the form of a narrow jet enters along the column axis and impinges on the bed directly. The second part is devoted to analysis of three different inlet configurations and their influence on gas maldistribution in the packing of Raschig rings. It has been found that the random packing of rings has comparable properties of flow uniformisation to the same arrangement of full cylinders with significantly lower pressure drop and much less pronounced effect of formation of localised jets at the bed outlet. Among the considered inlet configurations the most beneficial is the one in which the gas duct is tangential to the walls of the distribution chamber. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Numerous theoretical and numerical models have been developed to characterize milk fouling in heat exchangers. Though they helped us understand the fouling process, they lack consideration of fouling layer structure and its evolution. In this work, aiming at a more reliable predictive tool, milk fouling is modeled in a simplified 2D heat exchanger. A unique feature of this fully-coupled multi-domain multi-physics model is that the dynamic change of fouling layer structure can be explicitly taken into account while bulk and surface reaction kinetics for beta-lactoglobulin (beta-LG) are coupled with momentum, mass and heat transfer. The structural evolution of the deposit is expressed via a continuously varying geometry of the fouling layer domain. Protein fouling deposition can then be modeled based on local information along the deposit surface. Model based analyses revealed a two-stage growth behavior with diffident dominant control factors. The role of different deposition kinetics on the overall fouling of the heat exchanger was also considered as a test case. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB A method for calculational recovery of complete molecular composition of the Fischer-Tropsch synthesis products on the basis of incomplete experimental data is proposed. The method employs VTPR equation of state for analysing the available data on the composition of gaseous and liquid phases at the exit of a Fischer-Tropsch reactor. It is shown that in most cases such data are incomplete and misleading due to both instrumental limitations and inevitable losses at phase separation manipulations. The critical thermodynamic properties of the synthesis products, as well as the parameters of the equation of state for the calculation of multicomponent equilibrium using the group contribution method are determined. The results of the calculations are displayed along with experimental data from the literature and data obtained in the laboratory and industrial scale reactors. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB A computational model for the prediction of triboelectric charging in gas-solid fluidized beds is developed in the context of the Euler-Euler two-fluid model with kinetic theory closures for the description of the particulate phase. Sub-model for charge transfer due to particle-wall collisions is obtained consistently with the boundary conditions of Johnson and Jackson (1987), and assuming the model of Matsusaka et al. (2000) for charge transfer during a single collision. Similarly, a sub-model for charge diffusion due to particle-particle collisions is developed based on the kinetic theory of granular flow of Jenkins and Savage (1983), and the aforementioned charging model. The Eulerian charging model is then coupled to the two-fluid model, with kinetic theory closures which are available in the OpenFOAM (R) computational toolbox for fluid dynamics. The model is tested to simulate the effect of polyethylene particle size (362, 462, 550 mu m) in the electrification process, and is validated against experimental findings (Sowinski, 2012; Sowinski et al., 2012). The order of magnitude of charge densities in different regions of the bed, predicted by the model, was coherent with the experimental results. The model also predicted that particles larger than 425 mu m would not stick to the column wall, which acceptably agreed with the experimental observation that particles larger than 600 mu m did not adhere to the wall surface.

AB Nanoparticles (NPs) have been successfully applied to reservoirs for enhanced oil recovery and fines migration mitigation at laboratory scale. Despite the successful implementation at laboratory scale, it is rarely applied at field scale. One of the major reasons for the delay in implementation is the lack of an appropriate model to predict the fluid-particles behaviour in the reservoir. An accurate prediction of the surface tension of the fluid system is particularly important in field design and development in the petroleum sector.
   The surface tension of NPs in deionized water increases with increase in concentration of NPs. This study exploits the Debye-Hilckel constants to calculate the mean activity coefficients of NPs in solution combined with the equation proposed by Li and Lu (2001) for single electrolyte solutions to estimate the change in surface tension.
   However, NPs behaviour in brine (electrolyte solution) is different from the behaviour of mixture of different electrolytes. In deionized water, the surface tension of the fluid increases with increase in the NPs concentration, but NPs in electrolyte solutions behave as surface active agent decreasing the surface tension with increase in NPs concentration. This work includes the dipole-dipole interaction and structural effects along with the equation developed by Borwanker and Wasan (1988) for surface excess adsorption. This surface excess adsorption is applied to Li and Lu's equation for mixed electrolyte solutions to estimate the change in surface tension.
   This study is able to model the surface tension of NPs with or without electrolyte. Here, the molecular interaction of NPs in deionized water and electrolyte solutions is considered to predict the fluid-surface tension. The free energy at the interface is affected by the intermolecular interaction of the NPs. This intermolecular interaction includes electrical double layer, dipole-dipole interaction, and structural effects. The proposed model shows a good agreement with the experimental data from previous studies. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The channeling effect at the container wall results in difficulties for heat transfer in the central part of packed beds with small tube-to-particle diameter ratios. To overcome this shortcoming, a new kind of packed bed is developed with radial layered configuration: a fluid-penetrable wire mesh is used to divide the container into two parts in the radial direction, which allows particles of different sizes for regional loading. Therefore, following the general rule of fluid flow distribution in packed beds, small particles could be filled in the zone at the container wall to restrain the channeling effect and large particles in the center to promote local heat transfer capacity. In the present work, to facilitate the proper functionality of new equipment using the novel method, a CFD simulation combined with the DEM method for random packing generation is conducted to study the characteristics of the new packed bed on the packing structure, fluid flow, and particles-to-fluid convective heat transfer under a high fluid velocity regime (Re similar to 10(4)). It finds that the new packing method could exhibit a much regular structure than the conventional packed beds. And outstanding performance is observed in pressure drop reduction and heat transfer efficiency improvement. Moreover, the well-known equations for pressure drop and convective heat transfer predictions are found not applicable to the new bed and distinctive features of fluid velocity and temperature distribution are identified. These findings are helpful for the design of high efficiency reactors. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Oxygen-treatment of as-synthesized molybdenum carbide at 296 K-423 K and subsequent temperature-programmed-surface-reaction with hydrogen was utilized to obtain oxygen-modified Mo2C (O:Mo-bulk = 0.002 for Fresh-Mo2C to O:Mo-bulk = 0.276 for Mo2C oxygen treated at 423 K) formulations. Benzene selectivity decreased from 97% at O:Mo-bulk = 0.002 to 18% at O:Mo-bulk = 0.276 while phenol selectivity concurrently increased from 0.2% at O:Mo-bulk = 0.002 to 81% at O:Mo-bulk = 0.276 in reactions of anisole/hydrogen mixtures at atmospheric pressure and 423 K showing that O* content can be used to tune the product selectivity in hydrodeoxygenation reactions on transition metal carbides. This change in selectivity can plausibly be ascribed to the formation of MoOx/MoOxCy species that disrupts ensembles required for selective aromatic C-O bond cleavage. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The study of the electro-dissolution of aluminum electrodes during the electrocoagulation process is important for understanding the mechanisms involved in the process. This study involved the experimental determination of both total and dissolved aluminum concentrations during the electrocoagulation processes operation. The total aluminum concentration was fitted with the Faraday's equation and was obtained 1.6 of current efficiency, indicating a super-faradaic behavior of the electrochemical process at the given operating conditions. Additionally, a mathematical model was developed considering the electrochemical dissolution of the Al anode, water electrolysis, hydrolysis of dissolved Al and water dissociation reaction involved in the electrocoagulation process. The simulated results showed a good prediction of the evolution of both concentration of dissolved aluminum and pH during the electrocoagulation process operation. The model was also employed to simulate the removal of arsenic from water by electrocoagulation showing a good prediction of the experimental results at the operating conditions considered.

AB The aim of this study was to develop a CFD model for initial qualitative analysis of the operation of the pneumatic nozzle used for dry coating. The calibration consisted in comparing the droplets velocity yielded by the model with our own experimental data. The impact of the sheet and ligament constants as well as of the application of secondary coalescence and breakup models on dispersed phase velocity were taken into consideration. It turned out that the secondary phenomena had the largest impact on the dispersed phase velocity. Only after they had been taken into consideration was the agreement between the computation results and empirical data satisfactory.
   Afterwards, the best set-up of the model was used for describing the plasticizer atomization in a draft tube of a spout-fluid bed apparatus. It was concluded that this process should be carried out with the atomizing gas at a pressure of 2 . 10(5) Pa. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In-situ formation of emulsions has been observed in a large amount of chemical flooding pilots, and their effect on oil recovery is of great interest to petroleum engineers and researchers. In this study, microfluidic and transparent sand pack models were used to investigate mechanisms of emulsion propagation and plugging in both pore and macro scales. A microfluidic chip consisting of high- and lowpermeability areas was fabricated to represent a heterogeneous area. Another chip was created with the same throat width but enlarged pore sizes (1.5 times larger) and reduced throat lengths. Two microscopic displacement experiments were conducted to compare the effect of pore structure on residual oil displacement after surfactant/polymer (SP) flooding by injecting the same emulsion slug. Meanwhile, the macroscopic flow path of the displacing fluid in the emulsion flooding was investigated using a relatively homogeneous transparent 2D sand pack. The emulsion plugging was proved to be a complicated process, and it could be strongly affected by pore throat structures. Fluid division and high oil recovery could only be achieved during the emulsion flooding in the condition with properly matched sizes of emulsion droplets and pore throats. For a relatively homogeneous 2D sand pack model, oil bank formation and enlarged sweep volume were observed in the emulsion flooding even though it was conducted after SP flooding. As suggested by results of this study, the in-situ formation of emulsion might significantly contribute to the oil recovery in reservoirs with tortuous pore structures, while making little difference in those with large pore throat channels that emulsion couldn't be trapped in.

AB In this communication, we develop automatically a reaction network for ethylene glycol reforming on Pt. We employ a recently introduced group additivity scheme for estimation of thermochemistry over metal catalysts in vapor phase and in solution along with Bronsted-Evans-Polanyi (BEP) relations for vapor phase kinetics to parameterize microkinetic models for vapor and aqueous phases. Unlike vapor-phase reforming, we show that solvent occupies a significant fraction of surface sites and by doing this, it shifts the water-gas shift reaction to CO2 and H-2 and avoids poisoning of the catalyst by CO. The model is found to be in reasonable agreement with the experimental data. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB For process simulation involving chemical reactions, thermodynamically accurate model parameters for chemical equilibrium are indispensable. We demonstrate that regression subject to the well-known chemical equilibrium constant entails violation of the sufficient conditions for thermodynamic stability. As a consequence, erroneous values of the equilibrium conversion are obtained upon use of the respective parameter values in, e.g., process simulation. In order to alleviate the problem, we propose a methodology for estimating parameters subject to necessary and sufficient criteria for thermodynamic stability. In particular, we propose an extension of Mitsos et al. (2009) to parameter estimation in reactive systems; an upper-level model-experiment mismatch is minimized subject to several lower-level minimization problems (LLP), which ensure the fulfilment of the reactive tangent plane criterion (RTPC) of Smith et al. (1993), along with other desired behavior of the Gibbs free energy. A fictitious single-phase dimerization reaction employing Margules and NRTL as Gibbs free energy models illustrates the thermodynamic guarantees provided by the proposed formulation, when the conventional ones fail. Our formulation conceptually allows any type of phase equilibrium, e.g., VLLE, as well as any type of activity coefficient model. The subproblems of the bilevel algorithm pose challenges to state-of-the-art commercial solvers. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Although different methodologies for the synthesis of heat exchanger network (HEN) problems have been introduced in the last forty years, there are still significant challenges to be addressed, such as solving large-scale problems. This study focuses on synthesizing large-scale HENs using mathematical programming to achieve near globally optimal solutions based on a two-step MILP/MINLP approach. In the first step a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model, TransHEN, is used that obtains a globally optimal solution at selected Delta T-min. By utilisation of this model, the most promising matches are selected based on feasibility and viability. The second step entails using the matches selected in the TransHEN of Step 1 in a mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) model, HENsyn, using a reduced superstructure, to generate a feasible HEN. This study presents also a simultaneous Total Site synthesis with direct heat transfer between processes, and is the first step in the wider project of synthesising an entire Total Site with direct and indirect heat transfer; and is the first step in the wider scope of synthesising an entire Total Site with direct and indirect heat transfer; however, in order to attain this goal, a tool capable of an appropriately handling large number of streams is required. The newly developed procedure has been tested on several case studies, two of which are presented in this paper. For Case study 1 the results obtained lie within the range of best solutions obtained by other authors. Case study 2, consisting of 173 process stream and involving multiple hot utilities, shows the applicability of the developed method to handle large-scale HEN problems. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Pressurized circulating fluidized bed technology is promising in coal & biomass combustion and gasification. To get more detail information of pressure effects on gas-solids flow behaviors in a circulating fluidized bed reactor, we built a novel pressurized multi-stage circulating fluidized bed (MCFB) reactor a cold pilot setup with 14.5 m height. The experiment was carried out at the elevated pressure up to 0.9 MPa with the use of polystyrene particles (rho(s) = 1020 kg/m(3), d(p) = 400 mu m). We used differential pressure transducers to collect the pressure data and monitor the operating condition. Local solids holdup was measured by the optical fiber probes. Our results showed that the apparent solids holdup presented multi-flow regimes in the axial direction of MCFB. Under the same solids circulation rate and superficial gas velocity, the apparent solids holdup and local solids holdup decreased, and the axial flow structure and radial profiles of solids holdup became more uniform with increasing the pressure. When the fluidized gas mass flow rate and the solids circulation rate were kept the same, the solids holdup at axial and radial directions increased with the pressure. The speed of gas-solids flow development was different at various pressures with a slower speed at high pressure under the same solids circulation rate and superficial gas velocity. As a result, the elevated pressure significantly influences the gas-solids flow behaviors and provides better riser performance with good gas-solids contacting and mixing by the uniform radial and axial distributions than the atmospheric pressure at the same superficial gas velocity.

AB Based on the bridge cavitation theory, the free energy variation during the cavitation between two nonwetted solid particles in a high temperature melt was investigated. The activation state and the stable state were achieved at the maximum and the minimum of the free energy curve varying with the neck radius, respectively. Increasing the separation distance between particles, both the activation energy and the stable energy increased. The activation separation distance was defined as the separation distance at which the extremum of the total free energy with respect to the neck radius had disappeared and the critical separation distance was derived by equaling the free energy before and after the cavitation. When particles were contacting, an equilibrium state was obtained as the system energy reached its minimum value. The equilibrium energy was the energy when the energy drop for the cavitation reached its maximum value. It is novel for the present study to find that both the activation separation distance and the critical separation distance were directly proportional to the radius of particles. Meanwhile, the equilibrium energy was a quadratic function of the particle radius. In the case of the cavitation between two 5.0 mu m alumina particles in the molten steel, the activation separation distance, the critical separation distance and the equilibrium energy were 0.96 mu m, 0.73 mu m and 17.75 x 10(12) J, respectively.

AB History studies of particle dissolution have been focused on both "bulk approach" and "single approach". The link between these two approaches can reveal inter-particle cohesive effect but it is rarely reported. The presented work addresses this scientific challenge by investigating individual particle dissolution kinetics, using Monte Carlo analysis to convert results to bulk particle dissolution profiles, and comparing them to experimental results of bulk particle dissolution kinetics. The impact of binder materials on inter-particle cohesive effect has been studied using spray-dried powders with a binary matrix formulation. Dissolution of individual particles across size range was observed under an optical microscope and analysed by Image Processing. The results were used to predict bulk particles dissolution profiles via a Monte Carlo analysis. Meanwhile, chemical measurement (conductivity) of bulk particle dissolution was carried out for the same sample. The comparison between Monte Carlo analysis and chemical measurements showed a good agreement for the samples without binder and with mix binder (Citric Acid + MgSO4 + Zeolite). For the samples with Silicate as binder material, the comparison did not correlate well, chemical measurement shows a generally faster dissolution for bulk particles than Monte Carlo analysis, and higher Silicate concentration in particles results in larger difference. This is mainly due to the polymerization of Silicate that forms a "shell" structure around the particle and slows down dissolution for individual particles. However, in bulk particle dissolution, high salt concentration in the local area around particles breaks polymerization of Silicate and reduces the effect on particle dissolution. Consequently, it is proposed that Monte Carlo analysis of individual particle dissolution can be used to compare to bulk particle dissolution in order to reveal inter-particle cohesive effect on particle dissolution kinetics.

AB A cold flow circulating fluidized bed (CFB) reactor is simulated under three fluidization velocities with the coarse grain discrete element method (DEM) using two different polydisperse particle systems namely glass beads and slightly coarser sand particles of Geldart A-B range. Particle velocities and particle concentration were measured by capacitance probe for the validation of the numerical model. The simulations were carried out using a homogenous drag model and a structure dependent drag model using the theory of energy minimization multiscale method (EMMS). Numerical parameters like grid resolution and computational time were investigated for the coarse grain CFD-DEM model, suggesting a cell uniformity criteria that might lead to more mesh independent results. The simulated macroscopic quantities such as pressure profile are generally in good agreement for all simulated cases using the EMMS model. Microscopic quantities such as particles velocities and solids concentration are partially matched well with the experimental data. The qualitative profiles of particle velocity and particle concentration are in better agreement for the EMMS model than for the homogenous drag model. The simulated reactor outflux using glass beads is well matched with experiment. The simulated reactor outflux with sand material is overestimated with EMMS model, although not that strong as for the Gidaspow model, in comparison to experimental measurements. One reason for the discrepancy is due to the cluster diameter correlation that require further development to be applicable in turbulent fluidization flow regime. Further model improvements are discussed and solutions are provided. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Furfural is a major toxic byproduct present in the hydrolysate of lignocellulosic biomass, which inhibits the growth and ethanol fermentation of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. To enhance yeast tolerance to furfural, extracellular redox potential (ORP) regulation was employed for the fermentation system through controlling ORP at -150 mV, -100 mV and -50 mV, respectively, by adjusting its aeration. When ORP was controlled at -100 mV, yeast cells exhibited improved growth, furfural degradation and ethanol production. Analysis of intracellular redox pairs such as NADH/NAD(+) and GSH/GSSG indicated a correlation between extracellular ORP and intracellular redox homeostasis. Moreover, intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) caused by furfural stress decreased under the redox control condition, which consequently conferred yeast cells tolerance to furfural. Comparative transcriptome analysis for yeast cells sampling under the ORP control at -100 mV further revealed that the expression of genes for proliferation was up-regulated to degrade furfural more efficiently. These results demonstrated that extracellular ORP regulation would be a strategy for enhancing yeast tolerance to furfural stress during cellulosic ethanol fermentation. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Realizing persistent thermal camouflage of heat objects remains challenging. A variety of biological species have evolved extraordinary thermal insulation strategies that represent an exciting source of inspiration for developing high-performance thermal camouflage materials. However, we are still far from being able to faithfully mimic these natural insulation materials not only because of the difficulty to imitate the intricate structural hierarchy but also due to the challenge to simulate the way used by nature, that is, each level of structural hierarchy collaborates together to achieve efficient insulation. Instead of biomimicing the biological structures, we here make a direct structure editing on the natural insulation structure of cowhide for obtaining multifunctional thermal camouflage armor. SiO2 nanoparticles (SiO(2)NPs) were in situ grown on the 3D hierarchically fibrous scaffold of leather, which played multiple roles in trapping stagnant air as thermal insulator, blocking infrared absorptive groups and reflecting infrared radiation from heat objects. The thermal camouflage armor exhibited a high porosity to 61.4%, as well as low thermal diffusivity (1.24 x 10(7) m(2) s(1)) and thermal conductivity (0.04 W m(1) K-1). The thermal camouflage armor exhibited persistent camouflage performance (1.0 h) and exceptional non-thermal functionalities, including hydrophobicity, flame-resistance, flexibility and arbitrary tailorability.

AB Proteins and in particular pharmaceutical proteins like monoclonal antibodies are expensive products. Protein crystallization is an interesting alternative process step to the common purification and formulation of such proteins. The solid-liquid separation of proteins however, is a challenging task because the proteins are sensitive to mechanical stress, which could lead to crystal breakage and often are only available in small amounts for research and development. In this study a newly developed filtration cell for the LUMiSizer (R) centrifuge is used to analyze the filtration behavior with low volume samples. Isometric and needle shaped lysozyme crystals serve as model protein crystals. The needle shaped crystals showed about twice as high compressibility and much higher cake resistance than the isometric lysozyme crystals. After the filtration at maximum pressure in the centrifuge the mean particle diameter decreased compared to the unstressed median diameter. With the filtration cell the cake height and filter cake compression can be monitored in situ and the filter cake resistance and solids volume fraction can be calculated with one experiment using 200-300 ( )mu l sample.

AB Glycerol is the main byproduct of the biodiesel production process and can be converted into valuable products by Yarrowia lipolytica. Betulinic acid is a pentacyclic triterpene with a variety of pharmacological properties. Herein we report heterologous biosynthesis of betulinic acid in Y. lipolytica by co-expressing lupeol synthase opAtLUP1, NADPH-cytochrome P450 monooxygenase opCYP716A12, and NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase opAtCPR1. Initially, the engineered Y. lipolytica produced 0.32 mg/L betulinic acid. This titer was increased to 9.41 mg/L following P450 enzyme fusion and overexpression of key genes from the upstream mevalonate (MVA) pathway. Substitution of glycerol for glucose further enhanced betulinic acid production to 16.98 mg/L, 1.8-fold higher than the titer obtained with glucose. 26.53 mg/L betulinic acid was obtained with 40 g/L glycerol as the sole carbon source, which was comparable to the titer obtained from Saccharomyces cerevisiae with 50 g/L glucose in shake flask cultivation. Glycerol improved betulinic acid titer by increasing the expression of key genes in the MVA pathway, and by increasing the supply of acetyl-CoA. Our study highlights the possible applications of glycerol as carbon source in the production of valuable terpenoids by engineered Y. lipolytica. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Single walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) have been synthesized from thermocatalytic decomposition of methane by using ferrocene as the catalyst at atmospheric pressure. Floating catalyst chemical vapour deposition using a horizontal two zone reactor was employed to investigate the kinetics. The effects of temperature of synthesis (800-1000 degrees C), partial pressure (2-40 kPa) of reactant gas and catalyst concentration (0.2-4.6 mol m 3 ) on the rate of formation of SWCNTs have been studied. The rate is proportional to the partial pressure of methane indicating that the surface reaction of methane on the active site is the rate controlling step. The activation energy was found to be 80.16 kJ mol (1). Raman spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy, BET, UV-Vis-NIR and thermogravimetry have been used for the characterization of products. UV-Vis-NIR spectroscopy data reveals presence of 78-82% metallic SWCNTs (m-SWCNTs) in the synthesized samples. The BET surface area of purified SWCNTs were found to be 871 m(2) g (1) with pore volume of 0.35 cc g (1) and electrical conductivity of 856-746 S cm (1). (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB A numerical method for calculating the mass transfer coefficient in fibrous media is presented. First, pressure driven flow was modelled using the Lattice Boltzmann Method. The advection-diffusion equation was solved for convective-reacting porous media flow, and the method is contrasted with experimental methods such as the limiting current diffusion technique, for its ability to determine and simulate mass transfer systems that are operating at low Reynolds number flows. A series of simulations were performed on three materials; specifically, commercially available carbon felts, electrospun carbon fibers and electrospun carbon fibers with anisotropy introduced to the microstructure. Simulations were performed in each principal direction (x,y,z) for each material in order to determine the effects of anisotropy on the mass transfer coefficient. In addition, the simulations spanned multiple Reynolds and Peclet numbers, to fully represent highly advective and highly diffusive systems. The resulting mass transfer coefficients were compared with values predicted by common correlations and a good agreement was found at high Reynolds numbers, but less so at lower Reynolds number typical of cell operation, reinforcing the utility of the numerical approach. Dimensionless mass transfer correlations were determined for each material and each direction in terms of the Sherwood number. These correlations were analyzed with respect to each materials' permeability tensor. It was found that as the permeability of the system increases, the expected mass transfer coefficient decreases. Two general mass transfer correlations are presented, one correlation for isotropic fibrous media and the other for through-plane flow in planar fibrous materials such as electrospun media and carbon paper. The correlations are Sh = 0.879 Re-0.402 Sc-0.390 and Sh = 0.906 Re-0.432 SC0.432 respectively. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The effects of adding hydrogen and nitrogen on soot concentration in atmospheric laminar ethylene jet flames are studied computationally and computed results are compared with experimental ones. Two sets of flames are studied: one in which the total volumetric injected flow rate is kept fixed and ethylene is substituted with either hydrogen or nitrogen and the other in which the ethylene volumetric flow rate is fixed but varying amounts of hydrogen and nitrogen are added. A two-equation semi-empirical model is employed to model soot. The model is able to qualitatively predict the measured trends of reducing soot concentration as hydrogen or nitrogen is added to ethylene or substituted. Quantitative agreement is within an order of magnitude and the results are found to depend strongly on the coupling between radiation and soot. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Gas-solid distribution is non-uniform in the circulating fluidized bed (CFB), which deteriorates gas and solid mixing, causing a lower system performance. In this work, the effect of ring baffles on system performance of a full-loop CFB is comprehensively studied using the computational fluid dynamics-discrete element method (CFD-DEM). Detailed information (i.e., solid velocity, solid flux, solid circulation rate, solid inventory height, solid residence time, and solid dispersion) are obtained and analyzed. Meaningful results include: (i) ring baffles improve the inter-particle and inter-phase interactions, and solid particles become more uniformly dispersed in the riser; (ii) introduction of ring baffles increases the solid holdup in local regions of the riser while has a slight influence on pressure drop; (iii) increasing the number of ring baffles and the spacing between ring baffles increases the solid circulation rate and solid inventory height, decreases solid cycle time in the system and SRT in the riser, increases SRT in the dipleg, and has a slight impact on SRT in the cyclone; (iv) the average solid dispersion coefficients in the riser along three directions are 0.675 x 10(-3), 0.522 x 10(-3), and 8.415 x 10(-3) m(2)/s, and the insertion of ring baffles decreases the overall dispersion intensity in the axial direction while has a slight influence in the radial direction.

AB The pipe transportation of gas hydrate-bearing sediments (GHBS)(1) is one of the key problems in mechanical-thermal exploitation of gas hydrate (GH)(2) in marine stratum. It is a gas-liquid-solid (methane gas-seawater-GHBS particles) three-phase flow, accompanied by GH dissociation. In this study, a three-dimensional Eulerian model combined with the kinetic theory of granular flow (KTGF) was adopted to simulate the gas-liquid-solid flow with GH dissociation. The commercial CFD software FLUENT 16.2 was employed, considering the hydrodynamics, heat and mass transfer, and GH dissociation simultaneously. A kinetic model for GH dissociation in the GHBS particles is presented, considering the influence of multiphase flow on dissociation rate. The model can capture the transition from the initial liquid-solid two-phase flow to gas-liquid-solid three-phase flow, describing the distribution of the phase volume fraction, velocity, temperature, and dissociation rate. The interaction between GH dissociation and multiphase flow is discussed. The simulation results indicate that the continuous production of gas bubbles by GH dissociation leads to more violent fluctuations in the pressure gradient and a more marked elevation of the solid particles compared with the liquid-solid two-phase flow without GH dissociation. In addition, the effect of GH dissociation on the multiphase flow under different hydrate saturations was analyzed. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID OXYGEN REDUCTION KINETICS
AB In the quest for obtaining accurate closed-form analytical expressions for polarization curve of a proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC), we have recently presented a two-dimensional model that accounts for oxygen concentration gradient and velocity gradient along the depth of a cathode flow channel. The model was developed for the case when Tafel kinetics of oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) on the cathode governs the overall rate of oxygen consumption. An improved match between predictions of the model and full three-dimensional simulations was obtained over the entire range of current density compared with earlier models which assumed homogenous oxygen concentration in the channel depth and plug flow velocity profile. In reality however, ORR kinetics is often not the rate limiting step for oxygen consumption in the cathode catalyst layer (CCL) at high current density since the Tafel kinetics is modulated by transport resistances in the CCL. In this article, we extend our two-dimensional analytical model to two different transport-limited regimes of CCL operation namely, slow oxygen transport across the CCL and slow proton transport across the CCL. We compare model predictions with results of full three-dimensional simulations in both cases and show that they are in excellent agreement even in these transport limited operational regimes of PEMFC.

AB In this work, an improved mathematical model was proposed for simulation of the diffusion of dibenzothiophene (DBT) molecules inside the porous materials in liquid phase. The experimental data of the diffusion were obtained in some silica adsorbents with uniform pore structure. The intrinsic pore diffusivity and intrinsic surface diffusivity of molecules were obtained through optimizing the parameters in the mathematical model with the experimental data. The bulk diffusivity of molecules in solution was obtained when the pore size of the silica adsorbents was large enough. The correlation of the intrinsic pore diffusivity with the ratio of diffusion molecular size to pore size of porous materials was established. In addition, the effect of pore size on the ratio of surface mass transfer to total mass transfer was studied and it was found that the smaller the pore size of porous materials, the higher the ratio of surface mass transfer to total mass transfer.

AB The meso-scale theory, based on the energy minimization multi-scale principle, has recently inspired the accurate modeling of the multi-phase flow. In this study, an axial meso-scale flow model for the gasliquid-solid fluidized bed is established and verified by the literature models and data. Compared with the reported axial models, this model predicts the axial distribution of all three-phase hydrodynamic parameters with fewer empirical corrections. Predictions of the present model show that the operation conditions and physical properties of solid particles obviously affect the flow behaviors of phases, such as the slip velocity, entrainment of solid particles, wake shedding parameters. Solid particles entrained by bubble wake determine the formation of axial distribution in the gas-liquid-solid fluidized bed. Region with the axial structure is the transition section, length of which depends on the entrainment of solid particles. Furthermore, behaviors of the gas bubbles and the solid particles are mutually influential. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB High capillary numbers are often adopted for chemical flooding in reservoirs to achieve the highest oil recovery. A high capillary number may be disadvantageous for high and medium permeability formations, while no experimental or field data are available for low permeability formations. In this work, through the use of a newly designed experimental apparatus for the measurement of the dynamic capillary pressure in low permeability formations, chemical flooding experiments on sandstone core samples (1-10 mD) were conducted to investigate the effects of high capillary numbers (0.001-2). In addition, these effects were examined through numerical production simulations on a real low permeability reservoir. The dynamic capillary pressure and relative permeability were measured to reveal the dynamic fluid flow characteristics. The dynamic contact angle was investigated to explore the dynamic interface properties. The results show that there is a second critical capillary number (higher than 0.02) that can be used to optimize the chemical flooding performance in low permeability reservoirs. Moreover, the oil relative permeability reaches its highest value at the second critical capillary number, while the water relative permeability always increases with the increase in the capillary number. The dynamic contact angle will reach approximately 180 degrees at a high capillary number, causing an oil film to remain. An optimized capillary number range is proposed for chemical flooding in low permeability reservoirs. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Past work involving validated "cold-flow" CFD modeling of self-generating and self-sustaining pulsating near-sonic non-Newtonian slurry atomization elucidated acoustic signatures, atomization mechanisms, and the effects of numerics and geometric permutations. The numerical method has now been incorporated with exothermic oxidation reaction kinetics relations along with radiation, i.e. no longer cold-flow. These models provide substantially increased model rigor and allow for new pulsing thermal measures which help assess injector thermal stresses. Twelve models have been run for extended periods of time in order to investigate the effects of dramatic changes in gas feed rate and prefilming (retraction) length. Given the new metrics and models, multiple statistically optimized designs are potentially available depending on the objective function(s) and their relative weightings in the overall value proposition to the project. In the case in which all metrics have equal value to the project and are simultaneously considered in a statistical model, the optimum design involves a mid-level of retraction and a mid-level gas feed rate. If, however, more relative weighting is placed on the importance of droplet size minimization and injector thermal management in lieu of feed passage pressure drop minimization, the optimum design involves a similar retraction but a very high level of gas feed rate.

AB Continuum models of porous media use macroscopic parameters and state variables to capture essential features of pore-scale physics. We propose a macroscopic property "accessivity" (a) to characterize the network connectivity of different sized pores in a porous medium, and macroscopic state descriptors "radius-resolved saturations" (psi(w)(F), psi(n)(F)) to characterize the distribution of fluid phases within. Small accessivity (alpha -> 0) implies serial connections between different sized pores, while large accessivity (alpha -> 1) corresponds to more parallel arrangements, as the classical capillary bundle model implicitly assumes. Based on these concepts, we develop a statistical theory for quasi-static immiscible drainage-imbibition in arbitrary cycles, and arrive at simple algebraic formulae for updating psi(n)(F) that naturally capture capillary pressure hysteresis, with alpha controlling the amount of hysteresis. These concepts may be used to interpret hysteretic data, upscale pore-scale observations, and formulate new constitutive laws by providing a simple conceptual framework for quantifying connectivity effects, and may have broader utility in continuum modeling of transport, reactions, and phase transformations in porous media.

AB We investigate numerically the homogenization process of a diffusive species in a mixing channel of arbitrary length downstream a microfluidic cross-junction. The channel length, lambda(alpha), necessary to achieve a prescribed level of mixedness, alpha, is targeted as primary quantity of interest, and its dependence on the Reynolds number, Re, on the flow ratio between the impinging currents, R, and on the Schmidt number of the solute, Sc, is analyzed. The accurate numerical solution of the mass transport equations up to values Pe = ReSc similar or equal to 10(6) of the Peclet number is here made possible by a hybrid numerical approach. This approach combines a recently proposed Monte Carlo method, enforced near the impinging zone, with a pseudo-transient 2D formulation of mass transport in the mixing channel, where purely axial (Poiseuille) flow settles in. At values of the flow ratio significantly different from unity (e.g. those used in flash nanoprecipitation) a non-trivial dependence of lambda(alpha) on Re is found at fixed Sc and R. This result is interpreted based on the spectral (eigenvalue/eigenfunction) structure of the 2D generalized Sturm-Liouville pure diffusion problem defined onto the cross-section of the mixing channel. Hinging on this interpretation, we show that for Sc >= 10(3) the dependence of lambda(alpha) on Sc at fixed Re and R can be singled out and theoretically predicted. By this property, universal ready-to-use curves yielding the mixing length for each assigned geometry can be constructed, which could be used to correlate the mixing time with other phenomena (chemical reactions, phase changes) occurring alongside the mass transport.

AB Electrospun nanofibrous membrane as a supporting layer has attracted great interests in fabricating high performance composite membranes due to its interconnected porous structure. However, it's still a challenge to prepare an ultrathin and integrated skin layer on porous and undulating nanofibrous support, thereby restricting its application in pervaporation. Here, graphene oxide (GO) was introduced into amine aqueous phase to form an integrated and compact polyamide (PA) layer on nanofibrous substrate via interfacial polymerization (IP). Under the synergistic effect of high permeability of the nanofibrous scaffold and flexibility of GO lamellae, tiled GO lamellae acting as a skeleton got involved in the initial reaction for the construction of selective PA layer. By loading trace amount of GO in aqueous phase during IP, the selectivity of PA layer was enhanced significantly compared with that of pristine PA layer on nanofibrous scaffold. High permeate flux of 6593 g/m(2)h with a desirable separation factor of 1491 was achieved using the hybrid membrane with just 0.001 wt% of GO loading for pervaporation dehydrating 90 wt% isopropanol aqueous solution at 70 degrees C. These results indicated the feasibility of constructing a single homogeneous selective layer on nanofibrous support for high-performance pervaporation process. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Safe operation of thermally sensitive chemical reactors remains a crucial engineering issue. Thermal runaway occurs mainly due to loss of temperature control, and many chemical accidents initiated by thermal runaway can be foreseen by an appropriate analysis of thermal process data. Thermal runaway criteria can be applied to determine the onset of runaway phenomena and safety boundary diagrams can be constructed. However, several runaway criteria exist, which define the runaway-and safe zones differently. In this work nine commonly applied thermal runaway criteria were analyzed and compared based on their critical curves. As a result of this analysis, two new criteria were developed. Reliability of the derived criteria were investigated, where the occurrence of real runaway was determined based on the number of indications applying different criteria. The two new criteria were tested in three general reaction systems and in case a complex problem, where feeding trajectory of fed-batch reactor was optimized applying new criteria as non-linear constraint. One of the new criteria shows the highest reliability in indication of runaway development from all investigated runaway criteria. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Eulerian-Eulerian and Eulerian-Lagrangian models are widely applied to numerically investigate dense solid-gas fluidized bed systems. However, only a few studies in the existing literature focus on a detailed analysis and comparison of the different modeling approaches. Therefore, the objective of this study is to investigate the Two Fluid Model (TFM), the Dense Discrete Phase Model (DDPM), and the Computational Fluid Dynamics-Discrete Element Method (CFD-DEM) with respect to a comprehensive independency study, a sensitivity analysis of the respective submodels and model parameters, a comparison of the simulation results between the different modeling approaches, as well as their computational demand. The simulations represent a test case of a pilot plant scale reactor (inner diameter up to 387 mm, height 900 mm), which is used within a thermochemical energy storage system (CaO + H2O <--> Ca(OH)(2)). Monodisperse Geldart B powder (particle diameter 200 mu m, particle density 2500 kg/m(3), sphericity factor 0.8) is fluidized with water vapor (ideal gas, temperature 400 degrees C, inlet velocity 0.495 m/s). Grid size, fluid and particle time step, and particle clustering are considered for the independency study. Different wall boundary conditions and calculation methods for the granular temperature are investigated for the TFM. For the DDPM, different wall boundary conditions are analyzed as well, while for the CFD-DEM, simulations with two different DEM submodels (Hertzian and Hookean collision model) and a sensitivity analysis of the respective model parameters are included. Results show that the TFM and the CFD-DEM are able to predict qualitatively and quantitatively similar gas and particle flow fields, if TFM model parameters are set appropriately. However, a quite different pressure drop and bed expansion is observed for each model. The DDPM does not result in realistic flow fields for the investigated test case, despite predicting a pressure drop and bed expansion similar to the TFM. The presented findings lead to the conclusion that model validation should not only be based on global observable values like pressure drop and bed expansion, but also on local particle flow fields and bubbling behavior.

AB Drying of capillary porous media involves coupled heat and mass transfer in complex void space geometry, which makes it very difficult to model and simulate invasion patterns. Thus far, modeling of drying was done using either continuum methods or pore network models (PNM), both of which have some limitations on representing the geometry of void space and underlying transport mechanism. Pore network models were in general applied to reconstructed void space, therefore, dynamic invasion patterns, cluster formations and dependency on drying kinetics may not be accurate. Alternatively, Lattice Boltzmann Method (LBM) is ideal for simulation of drying in capillary porous media as it can incorporate complex effects in a simple and natural way. In this work, the Lattice Boltzmann Method (LBM) using Shan Chen multiphase representation is used to simulate invasion patterns during the drying of four different void space computation domains, differing in both pore and throat geometries.
   The dynamics of invasion patterns and cluster formation were captured in all four computation domains. Due to the complex geometries present in porous media, capillary instabilities are often observed which leads to sudden jumps in the fluid-fluid interface. In this work, the effects of such instabilities on the liquid distribution are studied. The invasion patterns are compared to identify the dependence of capillary instabilities on the pore structure. It was observed that fluid-fluid interface motion could be classified into two types- evaporation-diffusion invasion, which constituted of slow invasion of voids by diffusion, and Haines jumps, which involved fast invasion of voids due to capillary instabilities. It was observed that some types of porous media exhibited an abundance of the former, particularly in irregular pore structures. However, regular pore structures showed a combination of both evaporation-diffusion invasions and Haines jumps. Lastly, it was observed that the rate of invasion of pores depends on its structure. Pores with sharp edges take a considerably longer period to invade due to a liquid holdup at the edges. This work emphasizes the advantages of using the LBM to simulate the drying of porous media for complex regular/irregular geometries. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB 1,3-diaminopropane (1,3-DAP), 1,4-diaminobutane (1,4-DAB), and 1,5-diaminopentane (1,5-DAP) are important chemicals due to their wide industrial use including agrochemicals, pharmaceuticals, surfactants, and building blocks for nylon synthesis. Over the last decade, several studies on bio-based production of diamines by metabolically engineered microorganisms have been published. However, development of efficient methods for the recovery of 1,3-DAP, 1,4-DAB, and 1,5-DAP from fermentation broth has not been reported. In this study, an efficient process for the separation and purification of 1,3-DAP, 1,4-DAB, and 1,5-DAP from fermentation broth without using highly flammable or toxic solvents was developed. The optimal process for the recovery and purification of these diamines from fermentation broth comprises several unit operations including removal of cell debris, decolorization of fermentation broth, product concentration, deprotonation of diamines, product separation, and final polishing to obtain pure 1,3-DAP, 1,4-DAB, and 1,5-DAP with yields of 87 +/- 3%, 86 +/- 4%, and 81 +/- 2%, respectively. Process development for the recovery and purification of fermentatively produced diamines reported here is expected to facilitate synthesis of bio-based nylons. Furthermore, the strategy reported here could be similarly applicable in developing downstream processes to recover and purify other diamines and related chemicals from fermentation broth.

AB Dynamics of Newtonian fluid pinch-off is universal, excluding the possibility of manipulating pinch-off behavior by varying initial and boundary conditions which is desirable in applications such as inkjet printing and microfluidics. Here we show that the dynamics of two-fluid pinch-off with disturbed inlet pressure (such as the profile of the conical liquid neck, cone slope, and neck thinning rate) depends on initial perturbations. The nonuniversality arises from pressure-fluctuation-induced nonlocal flow velocity that stretches the axial length scale of the pinch-off region. We renormalize the disturbed pinch-off using the linear ratio, (1 + beta epsilon), with beta being the empirical constant and epsilon the dimensionless pressure fluctuation. We further apply the pressure fluctuation in engineering pinch-off where the disturbed and undisturbed systems have identical pinch-off dynamics but distinct material properties. Our results could provide useful guidelines for controlling the breakup of liquid threads with extreme physical properties, such as ultrahigh viscosity and ultralow interfacial tension, in inkjet printing and microfluidics for a range of applications.

AB This paper deals with the study of the integration of ethanol steam reforming and ethanol combustion in a parallel plates reactor aiming a hydrogen production of 1 kW(th) equivalent. The study was performed by means of a mathematical model of a non-adiabatic reactor and the associated heat exchangers used for preheating purposes. Focus is given here to the influence of the insulation of the reactor and heat exchangers, the fuel concentration, fuel distribution policy to the reactor, and reforming flowrate. Thermal coupling between combustion and reforming of ethanol in terms of energetic integration is feasible and an adequate behavior of the reactor and the heat exchangers is predicted. The importance of heat losses to the environment is evidenced since they represent about 35-50% of the heat released by the combustion. Ranges of ethanol fuel concentration (0.6-2.0% of ethanol fuel) and distribution (1 or 2 feed ports), and ethanol reforming load (0.37-0.63 kg/h) were studied to find windows for these variables where a satisfactory operation is possible.

AB Evolutionary optimization studies are mainly focused on the type of methodologies and controlling parameters of the algorithms. However, the choice of fitness functions which gives a measure on how well a dataset correlates with reference values is often not justified in a rigorous way. The work in this paper addresses this issue by investigating the performance of a set of fitness functions and their suitability according to the input data used for training the optimization algorithms. A Genetic Algorithm was applied to a chemical kinetics problem with the aim of matching the measured species concentrations through optimization of a set of Arrhenius reaction rate parameters. The challenge with this type of problem lies in the wide range of species concentrations used as the training dataset, where they can be up to fifteen orders in magnitude. This revealed large differences in optimized values arising from the various fitness function formulations, thus highlighting the need for detailed knowledge of fitness functions for a specific optimization problem. Furthermore, the quality of training dataset through error propagation and a scaling parameter were assessed bringing further insight on differences fitness functions. Such information is crucial for the appropriate selection of fitness functions for the effective optimisation of reaction rate parameters. Crown Copyright (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB The analysis of dispersive flows in heterogeneous porous media is complicated by the appearance of anomalous transport. Novel laboratory protocols are needed to probe the mixing process by measuring the spatial structure of the concentration field in the medium. Here, we report on a systematic investigation of miscible displacements in a microporous limestone over the range of Peclet numbers, 20 < Pe < 600. Our approach combines pulse-tracer tests with the simultaneous imaging of the flow by Positron Emission Tomography (PET). Validation of the experimental protocol is achieved by means of control experiments on random beadpacks, as well as by comparing observations with both brine- and radio-tracers (labelled with C-11 or F-18). The application of residence time distribution functions reveals mass transport limitations in the porous rock in the form of a characteristic flow-rate effect. Two transport models, namely the Advection Dispersion Equation (ADE) and the Multi-Rate Mass Transfer (MRMT) model, are thoroughly evaluated with both the experimental breakthrough curves and the internal concentration profiles. We observe that the dispersion coefficient scales linearly with the Peclet number for both porous systems. The tracer profiles acquired on the rock sample are successfully described upon application of the MRMT model that uses two representative grain sizes and a fraction of intra-granular pore space that is independent of the fluid velocity. The analysis of the PET images evidences the presence of macrodispersive spreading caused by subcore-scale heterogeneities, which contribute significantly to the value of the estimated core-scale dispersivity. This effect can be significantly reduced upon application of the 'dispersion-echo' technique, which enables decoupling the effects of spreading and mixing in heterogeneous porous media. These observations are likely to apply to any laboratory-scale rock sample and the approach presented here provides a practical means to study anomalous transport in these systems.

AB The phenomenon of "Conservatively Perturbed Equilibrium" (CPE) in chemical kinetics is distinguished using a sequence of first-order reactions (linear mechanism) and non-linear mechanisms as well. In this phenomenon, some, not all initial concentrations of the closed chemical system are replaced by the corresponding equilibrium concentrations at the same total amount of each chemical element.
   Properties of CPE-phenomenon are described:
   1. For the substance which initial concentration is taken as the equilibrium one, the concentration extremum in a way to the equilibrium is unavoidable.
   2. This extremum can be a momentary partial equilibrium for some steps of the chemical mechanism.
   3. Time of occurrence of this extremum is independent of the perturbation.
   Properties 1 and 2 are general properties. Property 3 is specific for the linear mechanism studied. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In this paper the cavitation phenomenon and bubble collapse in submerged water jet added with CTAC were studied. The cavitation simulation was based on an improved cavitation model established by introducing coefficients into traditional cavitation model. The coefficients were obtained by fitting the numerical solutions of Rayleigh-Plesset equation in which the viscosity term and surface tension term were not neglected. Cross model was also employed to express the shear-thinning character of the surfactant solution. Simulation results show that the whole cavitation intensity decreased but the scale of cavitation region increased in drag-reducer solution. The submerged water jet added with drag-reducer was less dispersed and the stagnation pressure near the wall was significantly improved. Simulation results of the bubble collapse process show that the bubble collapsed more slowly in drag-reducer solution in comparison with that in pure water. The two pressure peaks near the wall during the collapse process appeared later in drag-reducer solution and the maximum value of the pressure generated in drag-reducer solution was less than that in pure water.

AB Motivated by the high performance of intermetallic compounds with their ordered structures, developing synthetic methods for preparing intermetallic compounds is highly desired. Herein, we report facile syntheses and rational design of the structurally ordered Cu-based intermetallic compounds (CuM (M = Pt, Pd, Au)). To achieve this, intermetallic nanoparticles were synthesized in solution by a butyllithium co-reduction method at 240 degrees C. The developed wet-chemistry syntheses of ordered intermetallic CuM nanoparticles avoided solid annealing process, and thus relatively small intermetallic nanocrystals were formed. The ordered PtCu nanocatalysts displayed enhanced chemoselectivity relative to the PtCu solid-solution alloy and individual monometallic nanocatalysts for catalytic hydrogenations of a series of substituted nitroaromatics. The DFT-based theoretical calculations for hydrogenations of halonitrobenzenes suggest that the surface geometry of ordered PtCu structures favor the hydrogenation of nitro substituent and disfavor the hydrodechlorination by-reaction, resulting in enhanced chemoselectivity.

AB A one-dimensional mathematical model of the fluid dynamics and combustion process in a bubbling fluidized bed was developed. In the bubble phase, the model includes the throughflow and bypass flow, which crosses the bed without taking part in combustion because of the preferential bubble paths expected in large fluidized-bed systems. Unlike in the classic approach, the emulsion phase was considered not to remain under minimum fluidization conditions, and the influence of downward particles was considered. A correction factor for the equation of the mass transfer coefficient previously described by other authors was therefore proposed to take into account the bypass flow expected in large systems. The main results provided by the model are the velocities and volumetric flows of the gases in the bed (emulsion, visible bubble and throughflow gases), the mass transfer between bed phases and the oxygen profile in the bed.

AB Neutron radiography can visualize heavy oil flows in metallic reactors used to upgrade heavy oils. Thus, we visualized heavy oil flows in a packed bed using real-time neutron radiography to support its capability and to offer basic experimental data necessary for verification and validation of numerical simulations. Atmospheric residue was used as the heavy oil sample and heavy oil and N-2 gas were concurrently supplied into a packed bed from above a reactor simulating a trickle bed reactor. Reactor temperatures were set at either 100 degrees C or 250 degrees C to change heavy oil viscosity. The heavy oil flow rate was kept constant at 2.5 mL/min and the N-2 gas flow rate was set at either 1 L/min or 3 L/min at 25 degrees C. A series of neutron radiography experiments was conducted at the B-4 neutron imaging facility in the Kyoto University Research Reactor (KUR) with a thermal neutron flux of 5 x 10(7) n/cm(2).s. We performed image processing for the neutron radiographs to calculate neutron beam attenuation and clarify flow behavior. Visualization results show differences in flow behavior depending on operating factors. Temperature had a particularly substantial effect on flow behavior because heavy oil viscosity depends strongly on temperature. The flows also showed different behaviors for 1 mm and 3 mm packed particle sizes because the void ratios in the packed bed, which were preliminarily observed by X-ray computational tomography (CT), change with particle size. Channeling flow was observed with 3 mm particles and a temperature of 250 degrees C. Furthermore, this work suggests that neutron radiography can be used to investigate heavy oil flows in metallic reactors. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The prediction of droplet sizes in emulsions is important for fields ranging from the chemical process industry to emergency planning in the event of an underwater oil release. Typically scale models have needed to be built and the results scaled up, but as computational resources have grown and turbulence models have matured it has become possible to use computational fluid dynamics (CFD) to simulate the behaviour of the fluid/s. While direct simulation of multiphase breakup at high Reynolds number is currently computationally impractical, this paper looks into the use of CFD along with a correlation function based on maximum turbulent kinetic energy dissipation rate to predict the Sauter mean diameter of droplets in a 1 in. baffle-and-vane type autoclave. The results show that using a RNG-k epsilon turbulence model with a simplified 2D geometry gave droplet sizes within 26.2 mu m of the Sauter mean diameter observed in experiments with no additional tuning of parameters. Correlating pipe and autoclave flows through the Reynolds number and the turbulent kinetic energy dissipation rate was also investigated. Using the traditional definitions of the Reynolds numbers the correlation is poor, the coefficient of determination of the linear fit to the log-log data is 0.64. The first modification replaced the diameter of the blade as characteristic length with the tip swept circumference which increased the coefficient of determination to 0.960. A further modification using data obtained from the turbulent fields of the simulation showed a significant improvement with the coefficient of determination increasing to 0.988.

ID OIL/WATER FLOW; TRANSITION; STABILITY; INSTABILITIES; PATTERNS
AB The interfacial wave phenomenon in oil-water flow systems is an important area of research, due to its importance in real world applications, especially in oil-water transportation in petroleum industry. The influence of interfacial wavy flow and transition of flow regimes on pressure drop, hold-up and heat transfer has motivated the research on this topic to enhance the understanding, to ensure the process safety and to improve the process economy.
   This paper investigates the interfacial oil-water wavy flow in upwardly inclined pipes. The test fluids are mineral oil (viscosity-1.6 mPa s, density-788 kg/m(3)) and water. The scope of the study covers the upward pipe inclination angles of +3 degrees, +5 degrees, +6 degrees, mixture velocities of 0.2-0.5 m/s, and input water cut (input water volume ratio) 0.1-0.9. Two different flow patterns were observed in wavy flow in upwardly inclined pipes, namely stratified wavy (SW) and stratified wavy and mixed interface (SW&MI). The flow images were recorded using a high-speed video camera through a transparent test section. The image analysis was performed using several Matlab programs to extract wave properties such as wavelength and wave amplitude, as well as the wave speed.
   It is observed that the interfacial instabilities increase with the increasing mixture velocity and with increasing inclinations. Increased instabilities cause interfacial waves to generate and release droplets, while the turbulent intensity in the oil phase also influence droplet formation. An approximately linear relation between wave velocity and mixture velocity was obtained for the wavy flow and a correlation is presented accordingly. Wave energy manifests itself in the combined potential and kinetic energy. The potential energy via the wave amplitude and kinetic energy via the wave speed and wavelength. The overall energy for nonlinear breaking waves is a major source for generation of interfacial droplets. When the flow velocities are increased at a constant input water cut and at a given pipe inclination, the flow regime transition from SW to SW&MI occurs. Meanwhile, the prevailing wavelength decreases and the wave amplitude increases towards the point of transition from SW to SW&MI. The wavelength and the amplitude reach a critical value and remain constant until droplets start to form and release. Once the onset of drop formation occurs at the SW&MI flow regime, the wavelength starts to increase and the wave amplitude decreases with respect to their magnitudes at the point of transition. For a given velocity range, the mean amplitude increases with increasing inclination and decreases with increasing water cut. There is an inverse relation between wavelength and wave amplitude, which means higher amplitude always results in lower wavelength and vice versa.
   The wave velocity was calculated independently by two different analysis techniques applied to high-speed video images. One was carried out in space domain and one in time domain from high-speed image sequences. All data points were within the 7% error margin with respect to 1:1 reference correlation line, assuring the accuracy of analysis techniques and the validity of the correlation derived for relating the wave velocity to the mixture velocity.

AB This paper examines the kinetics of Fast Flotation of very fine, hydrophobic particles using a rectangularsectioned downcomer in the Reflux Flotation Cell (RFC). Three separate downcomers of equal height and breadth, but different channel widths of 2, 4.5, and 9 mm, were used to investigate the recovery of particles ranging from 1 to 100 mu m in diameter. The RFC utilises parallel inclined channels to enhance the segregation rate of rising bubbles in liquid, a phenomenon known as the Boycott Effect. This work was focused on the contribution of the downcomer kinetics to the Fast Flotation. Feed fluxes over the range of 0.9-8.6 cm/s were examined, with residence times in the downcomer of less than 1 s. Recovery due to entrainment was made consistent by fixing the portion of liquid reporting to the overflow to 10% of the feed volumetric rate, independent of the gas flux employed. Kinetic rate constants for the particle recoveries were analysed by varying flotation parameters such as particle size, gas flux and feed flux, obtaining downcomer kinetic constants of up to 419 min(-1). Distinct kinetic behaviour was found for the 1-10 mu m and 10-100 mu m coarser particles, with the kinetics of finer particles being more dependent on the particle size. The kinetics using the narrower downcomer widths (4.5 mm and 2 mm) relied more on the gas flux than the feed flux, while the kinetics using the wider downcomer width showed more dependence on the feed flux. Scaling laws for the kinetic rate constant were derived empirically based on the downcomer channel width, particle size, gas flux and feed flux. These scaling laws provided insight into the underlying mechanisms and a basis for exploring the potential flotation performance over a wide range of system operational conditions. The narrower downcomers exhibited better performance at the feed fluxes <10 cm/s. Above this feed flux, the wider downcomer of 9 mm performed better, especially for coarser particles above 10 mu m. A basis for downcomer system design is provided based on the kinetic scaling laws. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Development and validation of sub-grid models are of pivotal importance for coarse-grid two-fluid modeling of gas-particle fluidization. In prior study (Zhu et al., 2018, Chem. Eng. Sci. 192, 759-773), we developed an effective three-marker sub-grid drag model to consider the local heterogeneity in gas-particle flows. In this study, we perform a comprehensive 3D hydrodynamic validation analysis of the developed model to its predictability. Specifically, the validation covers more flow situations with respect to rapid, turbulent and bubbling fluidization. Besides, we introduce a simplified wall correction factor for assessing how the bounding walls impact on flow hydrodynamics. Computational results accord well with the experimental data over various flow regimes. The developed model can adequately capture the macroscopic flow properties without an additional wall modification. Compared with the fine-grid two-fluid modeling using the uniform drag model for a lab-scale riser, approximately 44 times speedup in computational time is achieved via the developed model. A much more significant reduction in computational time can be consequently expected for industrial-scale reactors. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Bubble coalescence is central to many important technological processes, such as separations, cleaning of oil spills, microfluidics, emulsification and foaming. It is well known that surfactants, which are frequently present as additives or contaminants, delay coalescence by slowing the drainage of the liquid film separating the approaching bubbles before they make contact. However, the coalescence and surfactant transport mechanisms developed after surfactant-laden bubbles make initial contact remain poorly understood. Here, we characterize these mechanisms using high-fidelity numerical simulations to predict the evolution of bubble interfaces, surfactant spreading, and induced Marangoni flows. Our results show that the surfactant initially accumulates on the tiny meniscus bridge formed between the coalescing bubbles due to the rapid and highly localized contraction of meniscus area. At the same time, a Marangoni-driven convective flow is generated at the interface, which drags the accumulated surfactant away from the joining meniscus and toward the back of the bubbles. Together, these transport mechanisms affect the rate bubble coalescence by dynamically modifying the local pull of surface tension on the bubble interfaces. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The flow behaviors of the particles in the upward and downward liquid-solid circulating fluidized beds were simulated by Eulerian-Eulerian approach incorporating the kinetic theory of granular flow. The Syamlal-O'Brien drag model was used to account for the interphase interaction between the liquid and solids phases. The numerical results agreed well with the experimental data obtained by other group members, successfully validating the numerical approach. The hydrodynamic characteristics of the particles with different densities and sizes in the upward and downward circulating fluidized beds were compared in detail under different liquid velocities and solids flow rates. The results indicated that there were many hydrodynamic similarities in the upward and downward circulating fluidized beds. However, due to the deviation of the standard drag curve, the drag force on the lighter particles in the downward liquid-solid circulating fluidized bed became different, leading to random and irregular particle flow behaviors. The predicted average solids holdups matched well with the results by an empirical model proposed by Sang and Zhu and the matching degree between the numerical results and the model was larger than 85%, further proving that the Sang and Zhu model is widely applicable.

AB The mechanisms of droplet breakup in a Microfluidic T-junction are mainly influenced by the capillary number (Ca) and the ratio between the length of the droplet and the transverse dimension of the microchannel (l(o)/w). This work presents numerical simulations of an isolated Taylor droplet in a rectangular T-junction microchannel in the range of 0.0096 to 0.0904 of capillary numbers and viscosity ratio of the dispersed and continuous phases, that is, mu(d)/mu(c) = 0.125. The numerical simulations were carried out with OpenFOAM 2.4 by using the S-CLSVOF methodology which was implemented for this study. The snappyHexMesh tool was used for grid refinement near the microchannel wall in order to correctly model the thin fluid layer between the wall and the drop. It was verified that in this range of the capillary numbers, parasitic currents could affect the dynamics of the droplet in the microchannel. The use of S-CLSVOF, the time step control and mesh resolution enabled a better capture of the interface dynamics. A mathematical correlation was obtained in the obstructed breakup regime for the dimensionless thickness of the droplet (delta/w) in relation to Ca, dimensionless time (tau* = U(d)t/w) and droplet length (l(o)/w). Two types of non-obstructed breakup were observed in the simulations, namely, partially obstructed, and with permanent tunnel.

AB Flash heating and high temperature processing of two biomass feed materials is presented as a sustainable thermochemical technique to leverage the entire carbon content of the starting material for various end-uses. Microalgae and rice hulls were flash pyrolyzed in a drop-tube reactor to form exclusively gas and solid products in the temperature range 1573-1873 K at gas residence times of 3-5 s. Product gas yields and compositions approached thermodynamic equilibrium predictions with increasing temperature, which were used in calculations for a conceptual solarthermal processing framework. The derived carbonaceous residue was further characterized for composition (atomic mass and crystalline structures), morphology (surface area, pore volume, surface roughness), and reactivity (via CO2 thermogravimetry). Solid residues generated under flash conditions tended to become nearly indistinguishable, becoming spherical with high macroporosities and similar apparent reactivities. These results were contrasted with slow-pyrolyzed chars of the same starting materials, whose characteristics were markedly opposite for microalgae and rice hulls, further evidencing the importance of char particle thermal history. Results from solarthermal operation show a high calorific value syngas, especially for microalgae at 1873 K. The applicability of carbonaceous residue in a particular downstream use requires further characterization and study. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Stage-to-stage column models are preferred for accurate process calculation in industry but include many non-linear equations making process optimisation difficult. Further, optimisation of feed and side draw locations or overall column stage numbers introduces integer type optimisation variables and transforms an NLP into an MINLP optimisation problem. We introduce the Adapted Edmister Model (AEM) as a new column shortcut method which is able to overcome the described challenges while satisfying industrial standards of simulation accuracy. The AEM is used in a two-step optimisation approach which consists of initial optimisation with shortcut models and subsequent optimisation with stage-to-stage models. Applying the AEM in two-step optimisation enables NLP optimisation of column stage numbers, feed locations, and side draw locations avoiding an MINLP problem formulation. In addition, using AEM results to initialise stage-to-stage column models improves convergence and gives rise to better optimal solutions. To demonstrate the performance of the AEM, it is applied in the optimisation of an air separation process where high calculation accuracy is crucial. Here, the two-step optimisation approach employing the AEM results in an over 2% better optimum compared to a classical optimisation approach which is high for this process. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Zirconia-based hybrid polymers has become one of the ideal encapsulation material for light emitting diodes (LEDs) with high extraction efficiency due to their proper refractive index to those of semiconductor chips. However, the controlling of the dispersion for zirconia nanoparticles in polymeric hosts to obtain optically transparent hybrid nanocomposites has been one of the major challenges. Herein, we reported the synthesis of zirconia nanodispersion via high-gravity-assisted homogeneous precipitation in an internal circulation rotating packed bed (RPB) reactor followed by two-step modification. An alternative to conventional precipitation in batch stirred tank reactors (STR), the process intensification by high-gravity RPB results in homogeneous micromixing during the nucleation and growth of zirconia particles, which are benefit for continuous and reproducible production of ultrasmall zirconia nanoparticles. The obtained zirconia nanoparticles are purely cubic phase with narrow size-distribution in the range of 3-5 nm according to the X-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy characterization, which were similarity to that by the conventional methods. Nevertheless, the average hydrodynamic diameters of zirconia nanoparticles in aqueous solutions obtained by RPB methods were much smaller than those prepared in conventional STR, which enabled easy control and surface modification for highly dispersed nanodispersion in organic solvents and/or polymeric hosts. After two-step surface modification, zirconia nanoparticles with goal-directed structures were obtained, with highly dispersity in various organic solvents (e.g. toluene, trichloromethane, tetrahydrofuran, etc.) and aliphatic epoxy resin, forming transparent hybrid films with tunable refractive indexes. The preliminary applications of these zirconia nanodispersions for LEDs encapsulation were demonstrated. The light extraction efficiency of the LEDs devices packaged with zirconia/epoxy hybrid material increased by 10 percent when the doping content of zirconia nanoparticles was 0.2, compared to the devices encapsulated by original epoxy.

AB Mixed ionic-electronic conducting (MIEC) membrane reactors are attractive for partial oxidation and oxidative coupling of methane (OCM) because of their ability to separate oxygen from air with a low energetic penalty, and introduce the oxygen into a reaction zone with spatial and temporal control. To facilitate design and optimization of such reactors, two numerical models for MIEC membrane reactors for methane reforming are introduced: a computationally inexpensive, coupled, two-chamber CSTR model, and a CFD model for reacting flow. The CFD model considers diffusive transport with a mixture averaged model, and was shown to agree well with previous experimental and modelling works. Both models utilize a detailed gas-phase chemical kinetic mechanism and a membrane oxygen permeation model that considers the local oxygen concentration. It is demonstrated that the CSTR model can be used to evaluate a large number of reactor parameters efficiently to identify optimal conditions for OCM. The most promising reactor operating points identified using the CSTR for a particular reactor size are further considered with spatial detail using the CFD model. It is shown that the coupling between oxygen permeation, gas phase chemical kinetics, and flow field can have a significant impact on the reactor performance. Here the flow direction in a typical button reactor was reversed, which resulted in a 40% increase in predicted C-2 yield. The increase is attributed to the shorter post-reaction residence time of the C-2 products in the reactor, thereby inhibiting deeper oxidation. This significant impact on the reactor performance can be utilized to improve the yield of partially oxidized products from membrane reactors. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The direct experimental data for droplet breakage frequency and daughter droplet size distribution is urgently required for the application of the population balance model. To meet this requirement, a method to directly measure the droplet breakage in the pump-mixer was developed using a high speed online camera. Two typical breakup patterns, tensile breakup and revolving breakup were observed and the number of the breakup fragments was determined. The multiple breakage was treated as a series of binary breakups. In order to precisely describe the daughter size distribution, these binary breakups were divided into three different types, i.e. the original tensile breakup, intermediate tensile breakup, and revolving breakup. The influences of the rotating speed and interfacial tension on the droplet breakup frequency and daughter droplet size distribution were then quantitatively investigated. Empirical correlations were proposed and good agreement was found between the prediction results and the experimental data. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In this work, computational fluid dynamics with Eulerian-Eulerian modeling approach is used in the investigation of the effect of the solid phase closure models on the hydrodynamics of a circulating fluidized bed riser. The studied models are the kinetic theory of granular flow and the powder modulus model. Computational performance and model prediction accuracy are investigated by performing transient simulations for three different cases and for different mesh sizes. The modeling results are compared with measured vertical pressure profile, external circulation mass flow rates, and particle velocity and concentration profiles obtained from a laboratory scale circulating fluidized bed unit. Additionally the computational times are compared to estimate the computational performance and to investigate if a simpler set of closures is computationally more affordable. The results indicate that both closure models can give good predictions for some quantities, while lacking in other quantities. The results indicate that the closure models for the solid phase have a noticeable effect on the model predictions, such as the vertical pressure profile and external circulation rate of the particles.

AB Nanoparticles have been widely investigated in enhancing oil recovery for unique interfacial properties. Bare nano-silica (NS) cannot be easily adsorbed at the interface due to a large number of hydroxyls on its surface. In this study, NS was decorated by dodecyl trimethyl ammonium bromide (DTAB), forming NS-surfactant via electrostatic force. In order to investigate the interfacial behavior of NS-surfactant at the oil-water interface, experiments and molecular dynamics simulations were conducted. Results indicated that NS-surfactant can self-assemble at the oil-water interface and solid-like films were observed, which contributed to 10.4% oil recovery of NS-surfactant flooding relative to water flooding. DTAB concentration, pH and NaCl were used to regulate the interfacial behavior of NS-surfactant. Interfacial tension decreased and surface coverage increased with DTAB concentration increase due to more NS-surfactant arranged at oil-water interface. NS-surfactant could arrange at the oil-water interface more closely through increase zeta potential, which could be achieved by adjusting pH and adding NaCl. Lower interfacial tension and higher surface coverage was observed under weakly acidic conditions. The addition of NaCl could greatly reduce the interfacial tension and increase the surface coverage.

AB Inert gas was introduced into a capillary microreactor for intensifying the mixing and reaction of polymer solutions. Operational ranges regarding volumetric flow rates of the gas and liquid phases deserved to be carefully selected for ensuring the process stability. Formation of side-by-side bubble flow in microreactors relevant to special properties of polymer solutions was observed with the use of high-speed camera. The gas introduction obviously promoted the mixing of polymer solutions in microreactors, and accordingly the improvement on the micromixing performance was confirmed by a diazo-coupling reaction system. Various factors such as the gas volume fraction and introduction mode affected gas-liquid two-phase flow patterns and thus the mixing efficiency in microreactors. Simplified mathematic models were developed to evaluate the shear effect and to reveal intensification mechanisms within the gas-liquid slug flow and the annular flow in microreactors. Moreover, the effectiveness of such a mixing intensification strategy for polymer solutions was further demonstrated through the sulfonation of polystyrene (PS) in the capillary microreactor.

AB In this work dynamic wetting failure of Newtonian liquids in a curtain coating geometry is studied using a hydrodynamic model developed in our prior work (Liu et al., 2016b). The model is used to predict the onset of wetting failure with curtain heights consistent with prior experimental setups. In the model, a Navier-slip boundary condition and constant contact angle are used to describe the dynamic contact line (DCL). The governing equations are solved with the Galerkin finite-element method and the critical substrate speed is identified at which wetting failure occurs. A boundary of a coating window is constructed which outlines the critical substrate speed for different flow rates of the liquid curtain. The model predictions are compared with prior experimental observations reported by Blake et al. (1999) and Marston et al. (2009). The model reproduces the non-monotonic behavior of the critical speed as the liquid flow rate increases. When surfactants are absent, our results suggest that the experimental observations can largely be explained with a model that uses the simplest boundary conditions at the DCL (Navier-slip and constant contact angle) and accounts for the air stresses there to accurately calculate interface shapes. When surfactants are present, our results suggest that a decrease in the equilibrium surface tension may not be the only mechanism responsible for changes in the shape of the coating window. In particular, Marangoni stresses may play an important role. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Spray drying is a basic unit operation in several process industries such as food, pharmaceutical, ceramic, and others. In this work, a Eulerian-Lagrangian three-phase simulation is presented to study the drying process of barbotine slurry droplets for the production of ceramic tiles. To this end, the simulated velocity field produced by a spray nozzle located at the Institute of Ceramic Technology in Castello (Spain) is benchmarked against measurements obtained by means of laser Doppler anemometry in order to validate the numerical model. Also, the droplet size distribution generated by the nozzle is obtained at operating conditions by means of laser diffraction and the data obtained are compared qualitatively to those found in the literature. The characteristic Rosin-Rammler droplet size from the distribution is introduced thereafter in the three-phase simulation to analyse the drying kinetics of individual droplets. The model predicts the theoretical linear evolution of the square diameter (D-2-law), and the temperature and mass exchange with the environment. The proposed model is intended to support the design and optimization of industrial spray dryers. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Graphene has attracted massive interest in numerous biomedical applications such as anti-cancer therapy, drug delivery, bio-imaging and gene delivery. Therefore, it is important to ensure that graphene is nontoxic, and that its cellular biological behavior is safe and biocompatible. Herein, a new route was used to enhance the biocompatibility of graphene, using several natural deep eutectic solvents (DESs) as functionalizing agents, owing to their capability to introduce various functional groups and surface modifications. Characterization of the physicochemical changes in DES-functionalized graphene were conducted by FESEM, FTIR, XRD, and Raman spectroscopy. There were considerable improvements in the cytotoxicity profile of DES-functionalized graphene compared to pristine graphene and oxidized graphene, as demonstrated by cell viability, cell cycle progression, and reactive oxygen species evaluation assays. We also studied the association between cellular toxicity of DES-functionalized graphene and their physicochemical properties. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study on the cytotoxicity profile improvement of graphene using DESs as functionalizing agents, and its cellular biological behavior. The application of DESs as functionalizing agents, especially for DES choline chloride (ChCI):malonic acid (1:1), significantly reduced the cytotoxicity level of graphenes. DES ChCI:malonic acid (1:1) also demonstrated higher tamoxifen entrapment efficiency and loading capacity in comparison to the functionalization with DES ChCI: glucose (2:1), ChCI: fructose (2:1) and ChCI: sucrose (2:1). Therefore, DES ChCI:malonic acid (1:1) is considered the most promising nanocarrier for drug delivery applications, owing to its lower cytotoxicity and higher drug loading capacity.

AB The Kolbe-Schmitt reaction is the traditional method for preparing 2,4- and 2,6-dihydroxybenzoic acid (2,4- and 2,6-DHBA). In this work, accurate kinetic models for the Kolbe-Schmitt synthesis of 2,4- and 2,6-DHBA were successfully developed. The relative errors between the theoretical and experimental 2,4-DHBA equilibrium yields are less than 3.7% as T = 348-473 K, [C6H6O2] = 0.4-0.8 M and [KHCO3] = 1.2-4.0 M. The effects of reaction temperature, reaction time, KHCO3 and resorcinol (C6H6O2) concentrations on the formation rates and the yields of 2,4- and 2,6-DHBA were investigated by the developed models. Results show that the 2,4-DHBA equilibrium yield exhibits a strong dependence on the KHCO3 concentration, and the formation rate of 2,4-DHBA is strongly dependent on the reaction temperature. Furthermore, the reaction time is a critical factor in controlling the ratio of 2,4-DHBA to 2,6-DHBA as the reaction temperature varies from 433 to 473 K. Additionally, the results of the present work deepen the understanding of the reaction mechanism, e.g. the rate-determining step and main reaction pathway of 2,6-DHBA formation.

AB Microfluidic-based concentration gradient generators (CGGs) have a number of applications in chemical, biological and pharmaceutical studies. Thus, precise design of the microfluidic system is crucial to maintaining the desired concentration gradient in microchannels. One of the design considerations is the length of microchannels in the structure of a CGG. A CGG with a short length fails to provide the complete diffusive mixing, while the size of the microchip would unfavorably increase by incorporating a long CGG. Considering a CGG as a tree-like structure consisting of T-shaped micromixers, the mixing process of the species at a straight microchannel has been solved analytically. Herein, we define a new non-dimensional parameter (psi) as the ratio of the minimum length of the microchannel required for the desired fluid mixing to the product of the channel width and Peclet number. The numerically obtained values of psi (i.e., 0.22 and 0.17 for 95% mixing in straight and serpentine micromixers, respectively) are in good agreement with the experimental results. The numerical simulation also shows that the value of psi is the same for all micromixers in a CGG with the similar microchannel structure (e.g., straight or serpentine) and is independent of the channel size (width-to-depth ratio) and fluid velocity. Therefore, psi can be computed only once for any micromixer with different structures (e.g., zigzag, square wave, and so forth) and then considering this constant value of psi, the minimum required length of all other micromixers in a CGG with similar repetitive structures and dimensions at the specified flow rates could be designed quickly and precisely.

AB Owing to the spatial orientations of carbon fibers, the porous electrodes of proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cells exhibit strong structural anisotropy, which affects the transport of species, ions, electrons, liquid water, and heat along the in-plane and through-plane directions. To capture the anisotropies of species transport, charge migration, and heat transport for PEM fuel cells operated at various loads, a two-phase flow, non-isothermal, computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model was developed and experimentally validated. Various anisotropic parameters were separately studied, and their contributions to the overall cell performance at different loads were compared. The results indicated the significance of anisotropic transport processes inside the electrodes, as the isotropic electrode properties overpredicted the cell performance. Among all the studied parameters, the anisotropies of the ion conductivity and gas diffusivity deserve careful consideration due to their significant impact on the cell performance, especially at high current densities. The anisotropies of the electrode permeability for gas transport and thermal conductivity can be neglected because of their limited effects on the cell performance. The anisotropy of the electrode permeability for liquid-water transport under a capillary mechanism had a considerable influence on the cell performance owing to its impact on the water saturation within the electrode.

AB While arcing during processing of food in a domestic microwave oven has been well known and has major safety implications, its mechanistic understanding is not available. A comprehensive multiphysics 3D numerical model was developed that couples electromagnetics, electrodynamics, heat transfer and moisture transfer. The model is multiscale with the electromagnetics and heat and moisture transfer at the oven cavity scale while electrodynamics at the smaller scale of the region around the food. The model was validated using calorimetric and temperature measurements and reproducibility of arcing. Time evolution of arcing, and factors affecting it, were identified by the model. In drier air, arcing occurs at a lower power level because the equilibrium between ionization and attachment is achieved at lower electric field magnitude than in moist air. Higher temperature leads to greater chances of arcing as higher temperature increases ionization more than it increases attachment. Small load of food also increases the chances of arcing. Sample geometry, orientation, and placement inside the oven are also significant factors. Conditions that lead to arcing were identified in terms of maximum electric field values and temperatures. These threshold conditions can be used to identify unsafe situations for domestic microwave ovens and other microwave devices for product and process designers. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB An experimental study of turbulent flow concerning the characterization of turbulence by two-point correlation and estimations of the turbulent dissipation rate is presented. The fluid used is deionized water and the test section used was a square shaped channel of 24 mm by 30 mm on the cross section with a length of 1 m. The test section also presented periodic baffle structure at two of the walls for enhancing and maintaining turbulence. The study consisted in the measurement of the velocities at different positions of the channel using Laser Doppler Velocimetry instrument (LDV), the velocity measurement obtained were used for estimating two point correlations using the Taylor's frozen hypothesis. Finally, the results from the two-point correlation were used for estimating the turbulent dissipation rate. Considering the difference in the methods for calculating the dissipation rate, a comparison of the accuracy of each method is presented. It was found that the methods presented in this work showed similar results and trends of the dissipation rate with respect to changes in flow condition and distance to the channel walls. However, better accuracy was obtained by estimating the dissipation rate using the second order structure function and the Kolmogorov's two-third law. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB NO oxidation activity of platinum-based catalysts undergoes reversible changes during operation in oxidative atmosphere typical for Diesel engine exhaust gas due to platinum oxides (PtOx) formation and reduction. In recent years, these changes were studied mostly with the mixtures containing both O-2 and NO2 so that it was difficult to quantify individual impacts of the oxidants on PtOx formation. In this paper, Pt/Al2O3 catalyst deactivation and PtOx formation with O-2 and NO2 was examined separately by the means of transient isothermal experiments at 150, 175 and 200 degrees C with alternating deactivation and probe periods. The largest extent of deactivation was detected at 175 degrees C where the NO conversion in the isothermal experiment dropped from 85% (reduced catalyst) down to 10% (steady-state PtOx level) over 4 h. The experimental data were then utilized for parameter evaluation in global kinetic model of NO oxidation on a diesel oxidation catalyst extended by the reactions describing PtOx formation and reduction. Though the rate coefficient for PtOx formation with NO2 is higher than with O-2, the overall PtOx formation rate and the steady-state PtOx level are higher with O-2 at typical component concentrations (8% O-2 or 250 ppm NO2). Similar activation energies were observed for both PtOx formation reactions. Validity of the model was verified also at lower O-2 and NO2 concentrations (4% O-2 or 125 ppm NO2). The developed model is thus capable of sufficiently precise prediction of catalyst deactivation at various O-2 and NO2 concentrations relevant to diesel exhaust gas. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB In the present paper we propose an optimization model based on fuzzy-Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) programming in which the external costs associated with the environmental impacts caused by energy generation and equipment construction were explicitly incorporated in the synthesis of Heat Exchanger Networks (HEN) using the eco-costs methodology. The damage categories that compose the environmental and economic objective functions were human health (HH), ecosystem quality (EQ), resources depletion (RD), greenhouse gases (GW) impacts and HEN cost. The inclusion of the impact in the optimal synthesis of HEN was performed considering the most used fuels in industries: hard coal, heavy and light fuel oil and natural gas. Boilers operating with each one of the cited fuels were considered, and three different technologies for boiler operating with natural gas were included (low NO x natural gas, modulating and non-modulating natural gas boilers). The weights were obtained through a questionnaire directed to a multidisciplinary group of specialists. A case study with two hot and one cold streams was used to test the efficiency of the model and results were compared to a single-objective model and to a model not considering impacts in the objective function. Results showed that the fuzzy-AHP programming model was not able to find HEN costs lower than those obtained by the single-objective model for HENs operating with heavy and light fuel oil. For the HENs operating with hard coal and natural gas, HEN costs were lower than those obtained by the single objective model. The same HEN configuration was obtained for all fuels considered.

AB The feasibility of droplet formation from the dispersion of one viscous fluid within another immiscible viscous fluid with low interfacial tension is shown to be very limited. In this work, the process of emulsion formation for low interfacial tension multiphase systems (e.g. aqueous two-phase systems (ATPSs)) was simulated, where the liquids were exposed to an electric field within a microfluidic device. For the first time, the formation of double emulsion via electrohydrodynamic (EHD) force within microfluidics was investigated. A three dimensional (3D) numerical model was developed based on finite-volume discretization of the governing equations to simulate the EHD-based single and double emulsion formation for ATPSs within microfluidics. The dispersed viscous phase moving toward the active electrode is subjected to shear stress, producing instability on the two-phase interface and causing the formation of a necking area. Upon removal of the electric pulse, the dispersed phase moves in the opposite direction resulting in the formation of the droplet. The volume-of-fluid numerical method was applied to trace the two-phase interface, and a height function was imposed to deal with the 3D contact angles. The effect of capillary number and permittivity ratio of the phases on the size and shape of the droplets was assessed and compared with experimental data. Through controlling the interface between the phases, pressure contours, and volumetric charge density contours, it is possible to generate EHD-based single and double emulsions from viscous fluids within microfluidics with applications in drug delivery, tissue engineering and chemical and biological processes.

AB A periodic density functional theory study of the sulfur vacancy formation mechanism on different edges of MoS2 nanocrystallites was investigated from thermodynamics and kinetics points of views. Thermodynamics study shows that the generations of vacancies on the Mo edge and basal plane were found severely inhibited by the thermodynamic limitations. Whilst the formation on the S edge can be proceeded spontaneously. Homolysis dissociation of H-2 molecule was found more favorable than heterolytic dissociation on sulfur edge. The process of dissociated H atoms to form absorbed H2S was proved to be the rate controlling step. By comparing the distribution of charges and FuKui function before and after the vacancy formation, the contribution of sulfur vacancy to electrophilicity of Mo was clear, sulfur vacancies formed at the edges of Mo and S is favorable to the following hydrodesulfurization (HDS) reactions, whereas, the generation of sulfur vacancies on the basal plane inhibits the chemical reaction. The findings are critical to the development of highly active HDS catalysts. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Undesired agglomeration of powders, known as caking, results in the loss of product quality and is unacceptable in many powder industries. Information on how ambient conditions influence the cake strength is essential to prevent caking. Although there are a lot of existing methods to form caked samples and even more to characterize them, there is still no consensus regarding these methods. Repeatability is rarely evaluated and the comparative studies remain infrequent. As a deliquescent powder, sucrose is characterized by a threshold Relative Humidity (RH), called Deliquescence Relative Humidity (DRH), above which it turns into an aqueous solution. Partially deliquesced crystals are linked by liquid bridges of aqueous solution. When the RH is decreased below the DRH, these liquid bridges recrystallize into solid bridges to form a hard cake. In this study, an accelerated caking device was developed to obtain homogeneous caked samples of sucrose under controlled conditions. Three mechanical tests were compared on the basis of their sensitivity and repeatability: the uniaxial compression test, the diametrical compression test (tensile test) and the shear test. The varying parameter was the amount of water uptaken before drying, and the data were fitted by cross-validated local linear nonparametric regression. The best mechanical test was found to be the shear test, giving a sharp failure of the cake along a predetermined failure surface and a linear relationship between the cake strength and the amount of water uptaken.

AB In this study, a kind of functionalized graphene oxide (GO) membranes was fabricated. GO nanosheets were pre-coated by polydopamine (PDA) via spontaneous polymerization of dopamine (DA) and then cross-linked with zinc ions (Zn2+) via dopamine-mediated complexation reaction. The PDA coating rendered GO nanosheets a large number of evenly distributed oxygen-containing functional groups, which are beneficial to bond zinc ions effectively and to create favorable microenvironments of the nanochannels in GO membranes. Both PDA and Zn2+ acted as cross-linkers to tune the interlayer spacing of GO nanosheets. Zinc ions also afforded facilitated transport ability towards CO2 in dry state. Taking CO2/CH4 separation as the model system, the GO-PDA-Zn2+ membrane exhibited significantly enhanced CO2 permeance of 175 GPU with CO2/CH4 selectivity of 19.1 in dry state owing to the large transport channels and facilitated transport carriers. Moreover, the GO-PDA-Zn2+ membrane exhibited high CO2/CH4 selectivity of 32.9 in wet state owing to the stable intergalleries and moderate interlayer spacing. It is envisioned that the synergistic manipulation of PDA and metal ions can be utilized to exploit a variety of 2D membranes with superior gas separation performance. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB For a melt flow with viscous heating, a temperature-independent viscosity model is simple to use in estimating its temperature profile. In this model, a constant viscosity is chosen to represent a temperature-dependent one. However, it is still not clear about what value should be selected for the constant viscosity. In this short communication, we derive a relation to find it, followed by validation using existing numerical examples. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In this work, we study the mass transfer of a solute in laminar, two-phase, stratified flow in a circular microchannel. The model developed in our earlier work (Picardo et al., 2015) has been used. We adopt a semi-analytical approach to model liquid-liquid extraction in the circular channel with stratified flow. A bipolar cylindrical coordinate system is employed for an elegant description of the boundaries in the form of iso-coordinate surfaces.
   The model developed for the circular channel is computationally intensive. We present a methodology to estimate the mass transfer predictions for the 2D circular channel from a 2D channel of rectangular cross-section and a 1D channel i.e. flow between infinite parallel plates. This is analyzed for different carrier phase holdups and fluid properties. It is found that the 1D model can accurately predict the performance of the capillary. Further, we conclude that a more viscous carrier phase results in enhanced mass transfer. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The manufacturing difficulties of complex fractal-tree-like heat exchangers have limited their industrial applications, although many evidences have shown that they have significant advantages in heat transfer. Nevertheless, the emerging 3D printing technology has brought great opportunity for the development of complex structured device. In the present study, three-dimensional (3D) fractal-tree-like heat exchangers were designed and manufactured using 3D printing technology. Their performance was evaluated from both thermal and hydrodynamic perspectives, the flow characteristics were investigated in detail. The results show that a fractal-tree-like heat exchanger can improve hydrodynamic performance, reduce pressure drops and has great heat transfer ability. In general, the fractal-tree-like heat exchanger has a comprehensive advantage over the traditional spiral-tube exchangers as it has a higher value of coefficient of performance (COP). Furthermore, the 3D printing provides a visual, efficient, and precise approach in the present research. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB A biofilm model was developed to describe the simultaneous NO3- and SeO42- reduction in a H-2-based membrane biofilm reactor (MBfR). Model calibration and validation was conducted using the experimental data of a reported H-2-based MBfR. With a good level of identifiability, the SeO42- affinity constant and the SeO32- affinity constant were estimated at 9.80 +/- 0.51 g Se m(-3) and 1.83 +/- 0.38 g Se m(-3), respectively. The model was then applied to evaluate the effects of key operating conditions on the single-stage H-2-based MBfR and the role of reactor configuration through comparing two-stage to single-stage MBfR systems. The results showed that (i) high SeO42- or low NO3- concentration in the influent favored the growth of selenate-reducing bacteria (SeRB) and therefore benefited the Se removal, (ii) the influent dissolved oxygen slightly inhibited the Se removal through enhancing the aerobic microbial respiration on H-2, (iii) the H-2 supply should be controlled at a proper level to avoid SeRB suppression and H-2 wastage, (iv) thin biofilm should be avoided to ensure a protected niche for SeRB and therefore a promising Se removal, and (v) the two-stage MBfR configuration offered relatively higher efficiency in removing Se and NO3- simultaneously under the same loading condition.

ID PERFORMANCE; SUPPORTS
AB The carbon dioxide methanation reaction is highly exothermal (Delta(r)H298K(0) = -165 kJ mol(-1)) and needs therefore an efficient process to evacuate the heat generated during the reaction. In this paper, a structured bed filled with an open cell foam was chosen due to the many advantages of this kind of reactor (high surface/volume ratio, low pressure drop, intensification of mass and heat transfer...). First we showed that the presence carbon nanofibers didn't have an influence on the hydrodynamic behaviour of the platelet milli-reactor. Then, we used in situ infrared thermography to measure the surface temperature of the catalytic foam during the methanation reaction. The thermal imaging allowed us to visualize the "ignition" of the reaction, as well as to show the presence or absence of hot spots and their temperature. In this paper, we directly show for the first time the positive effect of carbon nanofibers on the surface temperature of the catalytic foam. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Electrospray offers unique atomization of liquids, whereby micro- or nano-droplets with very narrow size distributions are generated from electrified Taylor cones. To scale up this process, many electrospray emitters must be operated simultaneously, while the flow rate per emitter must remain low enough to preserve stability. To cope with the electrostatic repulsion between the various elements in the system, it is common to position the emitters very near a counter-electrode. Instead, we have studied the conditions leading to robust scalable spraying by using linear arrays of electrosprays in which the counter-electrode is far compared to the inter-emitter separation. In our design, a row of emitter tubes protrudes out of a backplate, and the counter-electrode is a flat collector plate (droplet collection plate set at a high negative electric potential). In addition, electrodes at both ends of the array enable uniform electrical field conditions, while preventing electrical gaseous discharges. Strong electrostatic interactions are expected between the spray plumes and the Taylor cones. Nonetheless, we show that this geometry is scalable without bound, both by electric field computations as by experiments performed under different geometrical configurations, liquid flow rates per emitter, and electrical conductivities of the liquid (mainly, NaCl/MEG solutions). The onset voltage necessary to stabilize the spraying at all emitter positions approaches a plateau as the number of operated emitters increases. Eventually, at high enough potential difference, the cones and sprays misalign, pointing in directions in consonance with minute zig-zag misalignments of the emitters, revealing the importance of small imbalances in the electrostatic forces at the Taylor cones.

AB This article focuses on the experimental work supported by theoretical model of the multicomponent mass transfer during extraction driven by spontaneous interfacial convection (SIC). The regularities of individual and joint unidirectional and reciprocal mass transfer of components with different surface-active properties in the benzene-water extraction system at a flat phase interface are considered. The article demonstrates that both the diffusion and convective hydrodynamics of the flow affect the intensity of unidirectional and counter-mass transfer of the components under the conditions of SIC. Marangoni instability at the interface causes local convection, which enhances the mass transfer rate considerably. Experimental studies have shown that the joint unidirectional mass transfer of acetic acid and iodine from organic phase to aqueous phase under the conditions of SIC can be characterised by an increase in the iodine mass transfer coefficient in comparison with its individual mass transfer. It has found that with the acetic acid the unidirectional mass transfer of iodine can be increased by more than 20 times compared to its mass transfer without acid. However in case of counter-transfer of acetic acid and iodine, both the acetic acid as well as iodine mass transfer coefficients decrease compared to their individual mass transfer situations. The experimental data are in accord with the theoretical justification. A simplistic semi empirical theoretical model is developed for joint mass transfer, to estimate the coefficient of mass transfer of the components. The satisfactory convergence of the experimental and calculated data are shown. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB A multicamera shadow imaging (shadowgraphy) system is developed to simultaneously capture particle dynamics at multiple locations inside a so called zigzag air separator which is used for separating fine from coarse particle fractions. The adaption of the shadowgraphy system to the specific requirements of the separator apparatus to measure particle sizes and velocities including calibration and particle size correction strategies is described. Measurements reveal the behaviour of glass beads ranging from 1 to 4 mm in diameter with variable particle mass loadings and air flow rates inside the zigzag channel. From the processing of the shadow data, particle flow morphologies and characteristic particle trajectories inside the channel stages are obtained. Furthermore, it is shown that particle mean velocities and particle fluctuation energies depend on the particle mass loading, the air flow rate and the location inside the zigzag channel. The results reveal novel quantitative insights into particle velocities in such an air separator which can be used to better understand the underlying particle mechanisms and foster the development of refined process models.

AB Dissipative particle dynamics (DPD) simulations were applied to investigate the solution self-assembly and pH-responsive behavior of hydrophobic DCPD (dicyclopentadiene)-loaded microcapsules from triblock copolymers poly (1,2-ethanediol, homopolymer-b-2-Diethylaminoethylmethacrylate-b-methyl methacrylate) (PEG-b-PDMAEMA-b-PMMA). Results indicate that micelles with longer hydrophilic PEG blocks and shorter hydrophobic PMMA blocks were in favor of encapsulating hydrophobic DCPD. Cross-linking at the core/shell interface generates a chemically bonded network structure in the micelle and leads to a significant decrease of their thermodynamic mobility (i.e., the increase of stability). Both non cross-linked and cross-linked micelles show a good pH-responsive behavior. In particular, cross-linked micelles still have the ability to carry DCPD due to the incomplete dispersion even completely pro-tonation of PDMAEMA, which indicates that the cross-linked micelles could be expected to realize the slow release of encapsulated DCPD agent.

TI Experimental implementation of a Quality-by-Control (QbC) framework

AB L-ascorbic acid is synthetized in large industrial scale from glucose and marketed as an immune system strengthening agent and anti-oxidant ingredient. The overall yield of conversion of the precursor glucose to L-ascorbic acid is limited, therefore the crystallization is a critically important step of the L-ascorbic acid production from economic point of view. It is widely accepted that the crystal size distribution (CSD) influences numerous relevant macroscopic properties of the final crystalline product and it also significantly affects the downstream operations. The present paper discusses the chord length distribution (CLD, which is directly related to the CSD) control, during the crystallization of L-ascorbic acid from aqueous solution. Batch crystallization process is employed, which is the classical, and still dominant, operation in fine chemical and pharmaceutical industries. A comparative experimental study of two state-of-the-art Quality-by-Control (QbC) based crystallization design approaches are presented: (1) a model-free QbC based on direct nucleation control (DNC) and (2) a model-based QbC using a novel nonlinear model predicative control (NMPC) framework. In the first investigation, the DNC, a process analytical technology based state-of-the-art model free control strategy, is applied. Although, DNC requires minimal preliminary system information and often provides robust process control, due to the unusual crystallization behavior of L-ascorbic acid, it leads to long batch times and oscillatory operation. In a second study the benefits of model-based QbC approach are demonstrated, based on using a NMPC approach. A population balance based crystallization process model is built and calibrated by estimating the nucleation and growth kinetics from concentration and CLD measurements. A projection based CSD to CLD forward transformation is used in the estimation of nucleation and growth kinetics. For robustness and adaptive behavior, the NMPC is coupled with a growing horizon state estimator, which is aimed to continuously improve the model by re-adjusting the kinetic constants. The study demonstrates that the model-based QbC framework can lead to rapid and robust crystallization process development with the NMPC system presenting good control behavior under significant plant model mismatch (PMM) conditions.

AB In the present work, a first-principles model of methanol partial oxidation to formaldehyde in an industrial reactor was developed and the reaction kinetic and deactivation parameters estimated, taking advantage of the temperature profile established by the exothermic reaction. The catalyst deactivation was assigned primarily to hot-spot regions in the oxidation reactor. The exposure to high temperatures enhances solid-state reactions that produce volatile compounds and a consequential loss of catalyst active compounds that migrate downstream from the hot-spot. This phenomenon was modelled implementing a new method where, instead of time, the deactivation was integrated as a function of the total consumed reagent until the instant of interest. This approach allowed computing the activity of the catalyst at any instant without needing to solve the model for the whole operating history until the pertinent instant; for simulating industrial reactors, where the operating conditions are changing frequently, this feature is quite relevant.

AB Particle tracking methods using emitted radiation are attractive for following motion in opaque systems such as granular materials. Leading examples are Positron Emission Particle Tracking (PEPT) and Radioactive Particle Tracking (RPT). The application of such techniques sometimes requires the use of tracer particles which differ in size, density and/or shape from the particles of interest. This study investigates the extent to which such differences affect the result of the study by using the open source MFIX-DEM software to model particle motion in the travelling fluidized bed experiments. The results are compared with previously reported experimental studies using both PEPT and RPT. Consistent numerical results were obtained for both PEPT and RPT tracer particles. In determining averaged velocities using such techniques, there is a choice to be made between averaging velocities of particles crossing a virtual plane over a period of time (the "face-average" approach) or those passing through a defined volume over time (the "volume-average" approach). The differences between results obtained with these two approaches are shown to be significant in this case, for both computation and experiment. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This study considers the role of the distributor effect during the bubble generation, growth and interaction within a bubbling fluidized bed. To characterize this effect, short-term and long-term dynamics are explored in time and frequency domains. Controversy occurs when inspecting what is actually known of the gas distribution mechanism in bubbling fluidized beds. To sustain discussion, classical and innovative techniques, such as Digital Image Analysis, DIA, and Wavelet Analysis WA, are used. As a result, the conclusion is that the distributor not only has no effect in the averaged long-term dynamics but also has no effect on the general bubble generation characteristic frequencies. The analysis performed on the bubble generation region concludes that the distributor design has a great influence at the short-term scale such as during the bubble generation process controlling the spatial distribution of the bubble nucleation sites over the distributor plate.

AB Reactive distillation has significant economic and environmental advantages compared to conventional processes. However, the optimal design of a reactive distillation system is far from mature. This work proposed a novel equation-oriented optimization framework based on a rigorous equilibrium stage model for the optimization of reactive distillation systems. A pseudo-transient continuation (PTC) reactive distillation model was developed to solve the convergence problem of simulations. The bypass efficiency method was incorporated into the PTC model to avoid the intractable mixed integer optimization. The developed model can be integrated well with a steady-state optimization algorithm assisted by PTC models. Two cases demonstrated that the proposed model and optimization framework were robust and fast. However, the bypass efficiency method caused physically meaningless solutions, but they were found to be convertible to physically meaningful solutions without influencing the accurate optimization of number of stages according to the intrinsic properties of the bypass efficiency method introduced in the current work.

AB The surface mechanisms involved in the Atomic Layer Deposition of Al2O3 from TMA and H2O are investigated by means of combined experimental and computational analyses. Reactant adsorption, desorption and surface reaction are taken into account by a surface chemistry model, coupled to a CFD model for an industrial reactor treating 200 mm substrates. Once the model validated by comparison with experimental deposition rates, the relative contribution of each surface phenomenon is quantitatively determined between 100 and 300 degrees C through original reaction probability calculations. It is revealed that the competition between surface reactions and desorption of H2O plays a crucial role in the ALD growth of alumina. The H2O desorption is the limiting factor for the growth at low process temperature whereas it is the OH group surface concentration at higher temperature. This integrated (surface chemistry/kinetics and CFD) model shows a direct link between transport phenomena, such as gas flow recirculation and low temperature zones in the reactor, and film uniformity.

AB Gasification thermochemical processes of biomass in a 20 kW downdraft gasifier are investigated using a robust two-dimensional (2D) computational fluid dynamics (CFD) modelling method. The model includes all the four zones of the gasifier namely drying, pyrolysis, oxidation and reduction. A step-by-step approach is proposed to evaluate the composition of different gas species as a result of the volatile break-up during gasification. However, selecting suitable chemical reactions for the CFD modelling becomes challenging as the commonly used reactions in kinetic study showed discrepancy in predicting the synthesis gas compositions. A revised set of chemical mechanisms is therefore proposed in the study and the robustness of the approach is examined with results validated against data from literature. The study reports how the air equivalence ratio (ER) affects the gasifier temperature and also the composition of producer gases. The model is then applied to investigate the syngas production of various biomass feedstocks sourced from Scottish agricultural sites. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Fouling from raw milk and from whey protein solutions mimicking the protein content of milk have been performed at two length scales, using a microfluidic heat transfer cell and a bench-scale device with hydraulic diameters 1.0 mm and 16.1 mm, respectively. The microfluidic cell allows raw milk to be studied in once-through mode and was used to identify polymer coated surfaces to test against stainless steel. Several of the fluorocarbon coated surfaces reduced the mass deposition but the pressure drop and thermal resistance did not match these directly, indicating that the nature and structure of the deposit is affected by the surface. A fluorinated ethylene propylene coating was identified as a promising candidate for large scale tests. At the interface with apolar surfaces, raw milk fouling layers were high in protein whereas a strongly attached mineral-rich layer was present at the interface with steel. The attraction of denatured protein towards apolar surfaces and the formation of a calcium phosphate layer on steel at later stages of fouling are explained with arguments based on the interfacial free energy of these materials in water.

AB With the development of techniques to control the wettability on solid surface, directional control of droplets on such surfaces exhibit promising applications in the design of microfluidic devices. The sliding droplet can even be trapped by the heterogeneous surface that is equipped with wetting defects. However, its detailed mechanism and general physical conditions required for trapping droplets displaced by another fluid have never been fully described. In this work, we present numerical simulations based on front-tracking method to investigate the trapping of droplets on a hydrophilic surface with a stripe-like chemical wetting defect displaced by another immiscible liquid. Three kind of equilibrium status are observed for trapped droplets based on the analysis on the dynamic of the contact line. We determine the transition conditions between trapping and escaping by mapping droplet dynamics as a function of nondimensional defect strength and capillary number. To reveal the underlying mechanism of droplets escaping, the deformation and motion including the dynamics of triple-phase contact line are explored as the droplet passing through the defect. It is found that the unbalanced Young's force acting the contact line could be a driving or resistance force, which is the key factor to dominate the critical condition of the trapping-to-escaping transition.

AB Experimental and numerical studies concerning the formation of droplets of a viscous fluid in a less viscous immiscible one (viscosity ratio of 533), containing surfactant, were conducted in a flow-focusing square microchannel. Numerical and experimental data from three flow regimes were analysed: threading, dripping and jetting. The results were analysed qualitatively and quantitatively and also compared to correlations from the literature. The droplet sizes and the thread lengths obtained experimentally deviate from the ones obtained for surfactant free systems reported in the literature. The roles of the surfactant mass transport limitations and of the interface rheology are analysed and discussed. The numerical code, based on a coupled level-set and volume of fluid method, successfully predicts droplets sizes in surfactant free systems in almost all the conditions studied. The limits of the numerical code to accurately predict the size of the droplets, particularly in the monodispersed dripping regime, were established. If surfactant is present, the numerical code fails to predict the droplet size under certain flow conditions. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB To develop a compact generator of bulk nanobubbles (ultrafine bubbles), ultrasound was irradiated to ultrapure water. Effects of ultrasonic power and frequency on nanobubble concentration and diameter were investigated. Nanobubbles with a diameter of 90-100 nm were generated. Number concentration of nanobubbles increased with time and approached asymptotically to an equilibrium value which was about 1.5 x 10(9) mL(-1). Nanobubble concentration increased with increasing ultrasonic power and decreasing frequency. For comparison, ultrasound was also irradiated to high concentration nanobubble water prepared by pressurized dissolution method. Reduction of nanobubbles was measured and nanobubble concentration decreased to the equilibrium value. Nanobubble concentration decreased with increasing ultrasonic power and frequency.
   Generation and reduction of nanobubbles by ultrasound was modeled to analyze experimental data. The generation rate coefficient of nanobubbles increased with decreasing frequency because cavitation collapse became stronger. The reduction rate constant of nanobubbles at 488 kHz and 1 MHz in high concentration nanobubble water became much higher than those in ultrapure water due to aggregation and floatation of nanobubbles. The equilibrium number concentration increased with decreasing frequency. The results calculated by our model were in good agreement with the experimental data. The nanobubble generator using ultrasound is compact, simple in operation and produce nanobubbles in a short time. This method is contamination-free because the liquid pump is unnecessary.

AB Increasing the heat transfer rate of heat transfer equipment is an ever-lasting topic in thermal engineering. Due to the advantages of light weight, high specific surface, high thermal conductivity, metal foam is a good extending surface for heat transfer enhancement. Nanofluid has a higher thermal conductivity than the traditional base fluid, so it can be used as an efficient heat transfer medium. This paper focuses on various flow and heat transfer modes of nanofluid, metal foam and the combination of the two, with the physical properties of nanofluid and metal foam summarized. The characteristics of flow and heat transfer are introduced. The motivation of this review paper is to arouse the researchers to pay attention to the basic transport understandings for the heat transfer enhancement of nanofluids in porous media. The knowledge reviewed in this paper is useful for improving the performance of compact heat exchangers, and heat sinks for cooling electronics with porous media and nanofluids.

AB Hydrogen assisted magnesiothermic reduction (HAMR) of TiO2 is a promising new process developed recently to produce Ti metal with low cost and less energy consumption. This work focuses on the understanding and optimization of the reduction process to control the quality of the reduced product. TiO2 precursor particles with different relative densities were prepared, and the effects of the relative densities on reduction by Mg in H-2 were studied. The changes of oxygen contents vs. reduction time at various temperatures were investigated. The phase transformations during the reduction were analyzed both theoretically and experimentally. The relationship between the morphology of the reduced products and the relative densities of the TiO2 precursors was analyzed by SEM characterization and the likely reason for the morphology evolution was discussed.

AB An approach to enhancing the chemical reaction process based on flow pattern construction was proposed. We demonstrated that the entropy generation due to mass transfer, chemical reaction and the viscous dissipation tend to their extremums when the performance of the reaction is enhanced. Based on this finding, a multi-objective optimization problem was formulated. The weight coefficients of individual objectives (various entropy generations) were derived according to their relative importance. The final objective function was formulated by the linear combination of the entropy generations of mass transfer and chemical reaction. By minimization of the objective function, subject to a constraint of fixed viscous dissipation, through calculus of variations, a velocity field and associate body force field can be obtained, by which the reaction process was effectively enhanced. The flow pattern obtained by optimization calculation can be used to guide the design of the internal structures in the reactors. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB The formation of an aqueous droplet in an organic continuous phase was studied experimentally inside a flow-focusing microchannel (190 mu m x 195 mu m: depth x width) in the presence of surfactants. A low viscosity silicone oil (0.0046 Pa s) was used as the continuous phase and a mixture of 48% w/w water and 52% w/w glycerol was the dispersed phase. Two ionic surfactants, C(12)TAB (50 mM) and C(16)TAB (5 mM) were added in the aqueous phase, at concentrations above the CMC values. Four regimes of drop formation were identified, namely squeezing, dripping, jetting and threading, whose boundaries changed when the surfactants were present. The drop formation process and the velocity profiles in both phases in the squeezing and dripping regimes were studied in more detail using a two-colour Particle Image Velocimetry technique. For all solutions studied, three distinct drop formation stages were identified, expansion, necking and pinch-off. The surfactant-laden solutions produced smaller drops. Considering the dynamic interfacial tension, rather than the equilibrium one, it was possible to explain differences in the drop formation between the two surfactant systems in the expansion stage. The forces acting on the forming drops were estimated and showed that the drag force overcomes the interfacial tension force at the transition between the expansion and necking stages. During this transition, the curvature of the neck changed while its thinning rate was increased. The transition from the necking to the pinch-off stage was signified by a flow reversal at the bottom part of the drop. (C) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB A systematic methodology to characterise porous structure of membranes and catalysts in terms of tortuosity and connectivity is presented. The considered case study is the CaF2-like structure of bidisperse spherical particles (i.e., inner and outer particles with different diameters), which are allowed to overlap. Consequently, the morphology of the resulting structure is shown to be completely determined by two geometrical parameters (two degrees of freedom). For this investigation, a Morphology Map is developed, it being a plot mapping void connection as a function of the characteristic geometrical parameters. Within such a map, we introduce the so-called Minimum Connection Curve, which is a characteristic curve representing the boundary between the connected region and the disconnected one (zero connectivity). It is then found that the CaF2-like structure has three specific points where there is an abrupt change in the morphology behaviour, also correlated to the normalised surface area. Then, the structure tortuosity and connectivity are systematically evaluated in a wide range of geometrical conditions of the two parameters characterising the considered structure. As a result, it is shown that it is not possible to express these parameters as a unique function of porosity. However, both tortuosity and connectivity are found to be correlated with a good approximation in a certain range of porosity values with a geometrical parameter that we called Effective Porosity, which is the porosity available for diffusion at the minimum connection conditions. Convenient empirical correlations are eventually provided to allow readers to evaluate tortuosity and connectivity in a wide range of values. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The residence time distribution is an important characteristic in the analysis of non-ideal reactors. In micro-reactors that operate predominantly under low Reynolds number, the axial dispersion is important. Since the channel length or residence time of fluid is usually not long enough, the axial dispersion model cannot predict an accurate RTD of the fluid in micro-reactors. In order to overcome this dilemma, a new model has been developed in the present work that combines the axial dispersion and velocity profile using the parallel tanks-in-series compartment model. The model comprises of two parameters, including the velocity profile exponent and Peclet number. It can be used for Newtonian and non-Newtonian fluid flow in the reactors with a wide range of Reynolds number and in all ranges of flow regime, including plug, laminar, perfectly mixed, and other profiles between these regimes. After verifying the model, the effects of velocity profile and Peclet number on the RTD of fluid in the tube for m-laminar and y-laminar velocity profiles were evaluated. Then, the RTDs of some previously reported systems such as straight Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) tube, multi-laminated/elongational flow micro-mixer (MEFM-4) and standard T-junction micro-mixer (TjM) were adjusted to the proposed model.

AB The dynamic operation of methanation reactors is under discussion due to the increasing interest in power-to-gas technology. Here, hydrogen is supplied via a water electrolyzer which is powered by fluctuating renewable energy sources. With dynamic process modeling and simulation, the methanation reactor can be designed. Since the methanation reaction proceeds fast in the presence of an active catalyst and releases a large amount of reaction heat, the model has to account for the pellet phase in terms of energy, species mass and reaction. In this work, a dynamic 1D heterogeneous model is presented. The model describes a micro-structured fixed-bed reactor for the methanation of carbon dioxide under industrially relevant operating conditions with periodic oscillations of the inlet feed composition. The simulation shows that the hot spot temperature changes significantly during the periodic operation, both in position and magnitude. For high frequency changes the reactor behavior moves towards a thermally relaxed steady state. The outlet methane concentration in the dynamic operation does not reach the steady-state value. However, the model reveals interesting insights of the dynamic CO2 methanation, which will be accompanied with experiments in the future. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Sub-grid models for filtered and residual stresses are required as closures in filtered two-fluid modeling of gas-solid fluidized flows. An approach for deriving such models consists of filtering over results from highly resolved simulations with microscopic two-fluid modeling, which are mostly performed under suspension like conditions as separation of scales is assumed. This means that no macro-scale effects are accounted for. In this work effects of flow macro-scale are evaluated by practicing conditions from suspensions up to pneumatic transport, under solid concentrations typical of risers, applying highly resolved simulations with microscopic two-fluid modeling in periodic domains. Results show that the domain average gas Reynolds number and the domain average solid volume fraction both considerably affect filtered and residual stresses of both phases. It becomes evident that accurate sub-grid models require macro-scale effects to be accounted for. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

   DIFFUSIVITIES
AB Molecular and energy transport in several porous materials can occur through both the pore space as well as the solid phase. In the case of paper and paperboard structures, moisture can be conducted via diffusion in the air through the pore space under low moisture conditions, but primarily through the fiber phase at high moisture contents. Prediction of the overall diffusivity or conductivity in such cases can become quite complex and the impact of the pore-fiber microstructure on transport is not possible. In the present work, a new method based on random walk inside the pore space allowing for a restricted walk inside the conducting fiber phases was applied to show the impact of this dual conduction on the overall transport of moisture (or analogously, heat). Model verification using periodic array of spheres showed the non-linear relationship between normalized effective diffusivity and porosity of the structure in correspondence with Archie's equation and agreeing reasonably well with literature. The structures of samples of paperboard were first assembled using X Ray Computed Tomographic (XR-CT) reconstruction after which a hybrid random walk algorithm was implemented. The walker was allowed to penetrate the fiber space in proportion to the conductivity ratio and also with an adjusted path length.
   Paper and fiber structures are strongly anisotropic, with the structure in the thickness dimension (z) being different from the in-plane dimensions (x, y). This is reflected in the anisotropy of the diffusivity tensor. Assuming fibers to be nonconductive, laboratory made paper fiber structures showed a nonlinear relationship between normalized effective diffusivity and porosity with in-plane direction being more conductive than the transverse direction. Since both the pore and fiber spaces are conductive to moisture, the diffusivity tensor has contributions from each space and can be assembled from the diffusivities in each of these phases individually. An important result from the present work is that initially anisotropic porous structures become more isotropic as the fiber phase becomes more conductive. Experimental diffusivity data and model simulations were compared showing the effect of structure on the anisotropic diffusion characteristics of paper. The results are presented in the form of a proposed 'effective diffusional tortuosity' and the intrinsic fiber diffusivity, as fundamental characteristics of cellulose fibers. With the development of new nanofibrous cellulosic materials, it is expected that net effective conduction parameters accounting for multiple phase random walks will be more prominent in controlling material properties.

AB Pressure loss measurements for packed beds of binary mixtures of angular parallelepipedal particles are reported for a range of Reynolds numbers from 40 to 800. Mixture void fractions generally lay between values for beds of the individual particles, but in two cases were lower than either component void fraction. Particles were found to overlap to a considerable degree in the bed, resulting in a reduction of effective surface area by up to 33%. A modified version of the Nemec and Levec (2005) pressure loss correlation which accounts for particle interference was used to estimate the degree of overlap, and gave values which agreed well with those estimated from photographs of the bed. This provides the means to estimate the effective specific surface area of a particle mixture of known component properties. It is shown that the appropriate parameters to use for a mixture are the volume-surface or Sauter mean diameter and a similarly defined average particle sphericity. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB This paper reports on experiments conducted with a cold flow model utilized for the investigation of the particle residence time distribution and mixing characteristics in a bubbling fluidized bed with continuous solids exchange. The investigated system is of a rectangular cross section (0.4 x 0.2 m) with a bed height of 0.17 m. A measurement device based on an alternating current bridge circuitry coupled with lock-in amplifier technology was built in the scope of quantifying the solids residence time distribution, whereby a pulse-injected ferromagnetic tracer creates the input signal. The implementation of a profound mathematical routine ensures the reproducible calculation of the particles mean residence time and characteristic values describing particle mixing phenomena. Therefore, the E-curve was modeled by mathematical convolution of the exit age distributions available for an ideally mixed continuous stirred tank reactor and a plug flow reactor with axial dispersion. It is shown that the in-bed mixing is highly dependent on the fluidization rate as well as on the solids circulation rate. Albeit the lowest superficial gas velocity equals a fluidization number of 4.7, the formation of dead spaces and short-circuit flows was observed under these conditions. Axial dispersion coefficients in the range of 5.10(-3) to 7.10(-1) m(-2) s(-1) were obtained. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The laminar burning velocities of iso-octane/syngas/air mixtures were numerically investigated using a detailed reaction mechanism over a wide range of equivalence ratio (0.4-1.4) at atmospheric and elevated pressure at an initial temperature of 423 K. The mole fraction of syngas in the fuel mixture was varied from the entire range of 0 (pure iso-octane) to 1 (pure syngas). To take into account the large variations of syngas compositions, the following three syngas compositions are considered: 75%H-2-25% CO, 50%H-2-50%CO3 and 25%H-2-75%CO by volume. The results show that the laminar burning velocity of iso-octane/syngas/air mixtures increases with the content of syngas, especially for higher H-2 content in syngas and rich mixtures. The enhanced burning velocity is attributed to the chemical effects of H-2 in syngas. The burning velocity correlates linearly with the level of syngas dilution of the fuel mixture, regardless of how the syngas dilution ratio is defined when the dilution level is low. The linear correlation remains over a wide range of syngas dilution when the dilution ration is defined as that introduced by Yu et al. (1986). H-2 addition and CO addition affect the radical pool differently and H is found to be a kinetics indicator for the burning velocity of iso-octane/syngas/air mixtures under the current conditions. Detailed sensitivity and pathway analysis was also conducted to identify reactions that significantly affect the burning velocity of iso-octane/syngas/air mixtures and to illustrate the kinetics interactions between H-2, CO, and iso-octane in iso-octane/syngas/air mixtures.

AB Constructing mass transfer highways in polymer membranes via fillers with hierarchical porous and/or hollow structure is an effective approach to enhance their separation performance. In this study, novel hierarchical porous organosilica nanotubes (HPSiNT) were designed and incorporated into Pebax matrix to fabricate hybrid membranes for organic solvent separation. The HPSiNT, with plenty of micropores (similar to 1.6 nm) on the wall of nanotubes and atomically smooth meso-inner channels (similar to 6 nm), offer abundant entrances and rapid diffusion pathways for penetrant molecules, thus endowing the hybrid membranes with superior separation performance. Employing thiophene/n-octane feed solution as a model system, the hybrid membrane that consists of 2 wt% HPSiNT exhibited a high permeation flux of 19.0 kg/(m(2) h) (increased by 66.8% compared with pure Pebax membrane) and thiophene/n-octane enrichment factor of 5.5 (increased by 11.7% compared with pure Pebax membrane), respectively. Introducing hierarchical nano-channels in polymeric matrices could open a new avenue to designing hybrid membranes with high permeation flux. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In this study, a molecular-level kinetic model of fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) slurry oil (SLO) hydrotreating in a trickle-bed reactor was developed. The physical and chemical properties of SLO were measured, and the data were used as input to tune the composition model parameters. A series of reaction rules were collected and established in terms of the reaction family according to the hydrotreating reaction mechanism. After applying the reaction rules on all the SLO molecules, a reaction network was generated containing 5,753 molecules and 15,830 reactions. The kinetic model was then built employing the Langmuir-Hinshelwood-Hougen-Watson (LHHW) formalism. The kinetic model parameters were reduced using the linear free energy relationship (LFER) and quantitative structure-reactivity correlations (QSRCs). The kinetic model was delivered to the trickle-bed reactor model, and the model parameters were tuned using experimental data obtained from a pilot hydrotreating unit. The obtained SLO hydrotreating model showed good agreement between the predicted and experimental product properties and composition under various processing conditions. The model was able to predict the concentration distribution of each species along the reactor. In addition, the influence of reaction temperature on the aromatic content and thiophene compound content was also evaluated. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This paper presents a theoretical model to describe liquid drainage of foams prepared from egg white powder with added an additive while reflecting the validity of the model. Having utilized some simplifying assumptions in the non-linear partial differential equation of the foam drainage, an analytical solution for free drainage was obtained. To compare the results of the theoretical model and the experimental approach, a number of experiments were conducted in order to measure the drainage of foams prepared from egg white powder with added sugar (10% and 30%), xanthan gum (0.01% and 0.05%) and Chubak extract (0.01% and 0.05%). First, an analysis was performed on the physical properties of the solutions, i.e. density, viscosity and surface tension so that the influence of the additive's presence would be examined. Moreover, the image analysis was applied to allow the assessment of the initial bubble size distributions. The experimental and theoretical drainage curves of different foams showed that foam drainage rate decreased due to the influences of the above-mentioned additives. According to the obtained results, the mathematical model can be adopted to estimate foam drainage rate. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The aim of many industrial processes is to manipulate solid particle aggregates within gas suspensions. Prime examples of such processes include fluidised bed reactors, cyclone separators, and dust collectors. In recent years, fluidised bed reactors have been used in the gasification of biomass particles. When fluidised, these particles are subject to various hydrodynamic forces such as drag, lift and torque due to interactions with the fluid. Computational approaches, which can be used to replicate laboratory and industrial scale processes, offer a crucial method for the study of reactor design and for the formulation of optimal operating procedures. Until now, many computer models have assumed particles to be spherical whereas, in reality, biomass feedstocks typically consist of non-spherical particles. While lift and torque are of minimal importance for spherical particles, non-spherical particles experience varying lift force and torque conditions, depending on particle orientation relative to the direction of the fluid velocity. In this study, we present a numerical investigation on the effect of different lift force and torque correlations on fluidised spherocylindrical particles. We find that lift force has a significant influence on particle velocities parallel to the direction of gravity. On the other hand, particle orientation is dependent on hydrodynamic torque. Results from this numerical study provide new insight with regards to the dynamics of non-spherical particles that can be of paramount importance for industrial processes involving non-spherical particles.

AB A novel microfluidic mixing strategy was developed and used to prepare polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) capped gold nanoparticles (AuNPs). In this process, 1 mM tetrachloroauric acid (HAuCl4) stream containing 1% (w/v) PVP was injected through the inner capillary tube and mixed with 20 mM L-ascorbic acid solution delivered co-currently through the outer coaxial capillary. The reaction mixture was hydrodynamically flow focused by the environmentally friendly oil Miglyol 840 delivered from the opposite side of the outer capillary, which resulted in the generation of reaction droplets in a tapered collection tube. The reactants were rapidly mixed within droplets by internal circulating flows induced by hydrodynamic interactions of fluids inside the droplets with the carrier oil. The size of the prepared AuNPs was measured by both dynamic light scattering and transmission electron microscopy and was found to decrease with decreasing the droplet size and increasing the difference in velocity between the two reactant streams, which improved mixing efficiency within droplets. The smallest nanoparticles were obtained when the outlet section of the injection tube was positioned at the entry section of the collection tube due to the highest shear at the liquid interface. The carrier oil formed a hydrophobic barrier between the droplets and the reactor walls preventing deposition of the synthesised particles. As a result, the size of the AuNPs was smaller than in the co-flow mixer operated with two continuous reactant streams. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Developing low-cost and binder-free Cu-based electrocatalysts for high-performance oxygen evolution reactions (OER) is of great importance to promote their practical applications. Herein, we demonstrate the low-temperature and rapid synthesis of hollow CuS0.55 nanoparticles on a Cu foam as highly active OER electrocatalysts through an anodic oxidation electrodeposition technique. The large electrochemically active surface area and strong adsorption ability of Cu sites to targeted OOH* intermediates are beneficial for enhancing catalytic properties. As a consequence, the hollow CuS0.55 nanoparticles exhibit an ultralow overpotential of 386 mV to achieve a high current density of 100 mA cm(-2) in alkaline media with a very small Tafel slope of 33 mV dec(-1), which is among the best reported for Cu-based electrocatalysts. The turnover frequency (TOF) is approximately 6 times higher than those of the corresponding CuS0.57 and CuO catalysts. This work provides a simple and feasible approach that can be scaled up easily to construct low-cost and efficient Cu-based OER electrocatalysts. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Gas dispersion studies has been executed for the catalyst bed section of a representative geometry of scaled-down industrial Moving Bed Hydrotreater Reactor (MBR). The catalyst bed of MBR is modeled using Axial Dispersion Model (ADM) and its parameters gas dispersion coefficient (D-g) and Peclet number (Pe) are estimated using Residence Time Distribution (RTD) and implementing a methodology based on convolution and regression. Additionally, dimensionless variance (sigma(2)(D)) for the catalyst bed is also measured using RTDs first and second moments to compare with those findings of ADM model. This study is conducted at the varying flow rates of gas and liquid including scaled down operating conditions. The results of D-g, Pe, sigma(2)(D) and indicate that bed behaves as a packed bed for low liquid flow rate and moves towards three-phase fluidized bed for increasing liquid flow rate. Overall the gas phase behavior is seen to be in plug flow for all the operating conditions, with relatively high dispersion/mixing in packed bed state. Scaled down flow conditions is seen to be best in terms of gas dispersion/mixing and catalyst utilization. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Structure design of proton exchange membrane determines the performance of vanadium redox flow battery. Appropriate pore size of the membrane not only benefits the proton conduction but also blocks the cross contamination of the vanadium cations. For this purpose, hydration sizes of proton, vanadium (II) [V2+], vanadium(III) [V3+], oxovanadium(IV) [VO2+], and dioxovanadium(V) [VO2+] cations were estimated by molecular dynamics simulation based on all-atom force field. The local hydration structures of the vanadium cations were consistent with the previous reports, verifying the adopted force field. V2+, V3+, VO2+, VO2+, and proton exhibit the hydration sizes of 8.24, 8.14, 8.18, 8.34, and 4.12 angstrom in the aqueous mixtures of sulfuric acid and vanadium sulfate. Thus the pore size distribution from 4.12 to 8.14 angstrom was recommended for the membrane fabrication. SO42- prefers to distribute around the vanadium cations due to electrostatic interaction, thus weakening the hydration structures of the vanadium cations. Introducing sulfuric acid decreases the local distributions of SO42- around and V3+, but increases the local distributions of SO42- around VO2+ and VO2+.

AB In the present study, a comprehensive coarse-grained computational fluid dynamics and discrete element method (CFD-DEM) is developed for modeling the fluidized bed gasifier. Based on the model validations against experimental measurements, a series of simulations are conducted to investigate the effects of different operating parameters on the coal gasification in a bubbling fluidized bed. This study offers new insights into the effects of gas-solid mixing on the gasification reaction. The results show the non-uniform spatial distributions of the gasification rate in both the horizontal and vertical directions, which reflects the preferential distribution of fuel particles. It is found that the gas back-mixing plays an important role in controlling of the pyrolysis gas combustion, which is undesired for producing gasification products. The results show that the sand particle size has the most remarkable effect on the gas back-mixing. Though the uniformity of the fuel particle distribution is not a key factor influencing the average product yields, the horizontal fuel particle mixing is found to be the main cause of the fluctuations of the gasification rate. Fundamentally, it is demonstrated that the fluctuations of the horizontal fuel mixing are mainly dominated by the bubble behaviors. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Butanol production from corn stover via (acetone-butanol-ethanol) ABE fermentation under vacuum was studied in this work. The reactor operating strategies considered were batch, fed-batch and continuous. The integrated reactor and vacuum separation process includes energy integration by a heat-pump system as well. A mathematical model describing the dynamics of the integrated reactors and the network of compressors and heat exchangers has been developed. The dynamic process models were used to select the optimum production strategy using economic optimisation where a methodology to determine the effect of scheduling of parallel reactor operation on the sizing of the heat-pump system was developed. The results suggest that the optimal operating mode for the integrated reaction system was fed-batch. Although the fed-batch process had the highest economic potential (37.8 MM USD), the compressor work for batch process operation (36.6 MM USD) was the lowest (1.8 MJ/kg ABE, 18% lower than that of fedbatch). Continuous process operation demonstrated the lowest economic potential (23.8 MM USD) and the highest compression work (2.87 MJ/kg ABE). The energy requirements of the purification system, a double-effect distillation process, were found to be between 3.45 and 4.14 MJ/kg ABE. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB We focused on the study of deformation and crawling of oil drops and the critical conditions for the incipient motion of a drop in a liquid shear flow. Through systematic experiments, the drop volume, drop physical properties, surface wettability, and flow rate were investigated. The deformation and motion were recorded by camera, and the main parameters were obtained by image processing. A force-balanced model was developed to explain the deformation of drops before incipient motion and the critical shear rate required for different systems by comparing the interfacial adhesion force of the contact line and the driving force of a shearing fluid. Experiments revealed that the critical shear rate required for the incipient motion of a drop mainly depended on system wettability and drop volume, and no detachment was observed unless in a low-wettability system.

AB A new fluidization system, the bubble-driven liquid-solid fluidized bed, adopting particles with a slightly higher density than the fluid, has been proposed. During the experiment process, air was introduced into the bottom of the column as driving force, and superficial gas velocity ranged from 0 to 28 mm/s and liquid was continuous phase but maintained at the stationary state. The variation of pressure drops in the bottom section near the gas distributor was measured to identify the demarcation of flow regimes and determine the loose velocity (U-loose) and initial fluidization velocity (U-in). It was found that U-loose and U-in both increase with the initial hydrostatic height but are independent of the initial liquid height. Moreover, solids holdup was analyzed using a photographic technique while gas holdup was calculated from the pressure drop variation and solids holdup. A non-uniform axial solids distribution exists for all gas velocities. Additionally, two fluidization mechanisms were proposed based on the experimental observations. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Axisymmetric lattice Boltzmann (LB) model has gained great development in the field of fluid flow and heat transfer in recent decades. Compared with the standard LB method, the axisymmetric LB method can solve 3D axisymmetric problems with minimal meshes. This numerical method will be helpful in research on thermochemical heat storage, especially considering the profound understanding and optimization of reactor performance. In this study, we extended a previous axisymmetric LB model to simulate the charging/discharging processes of a MgO/Mg(OH)(2) thermochemical reactor. We derived a new evolution function by including an unstable heat source term out of a chemical reaction. New isothermal and heat flux boundary treatment approaches were proposed to maintain the precision of this axisymmetric LB model in the presence of the heat source term. In addition, a local method for transient conjugate heat transfer simulation without the utilization of temperature gradient information at the fluid-solid interface was developed to predict heat transfer between the reactor bed and heat transfer fluid. With the proposed axisymmetric thermal LB model, the charging/discharging processes of a tubular MgO/Mg(OH)(2) thermochemical reactor unit with a heat exchanger were simulated. Results showed that the average power output was maximized with a bed thickness of 1.0 cm. The length of the reactor unit should be considered by balancing power output and cost.

AB The transformations from polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) to polymers and finally to young soot were simulated under different initial conditions at flame temperatures using Reax-FF MD. At low temperatures, PAH heterogeneous nucleation is mainly through physical interactions, but these clusters are not stable at higher temperatures. The molecular dynamics simulation results at 1450 K suggested that soot growth at intermediate temperature and low radical concentration conditions mainly controlled by chemical reactions involving carbon addition directly, without hydrogen abstraction. Some branched chains can be added to the PAH edges and small PAHs grow into dimers, trimers, or larger molecules through combination with unsaturated aliphatic hydrocarbons. At higher temperatures, radical-molecule reactions, such as via the HACA mechanism, reactions of aryl radicals and aryl-acetylene, and radical-radical reactions involving the combination of two aryl radicals, are dominant in soot formation because of high radical concentrations.

AB Hydrolysis of hemicelluloses with acid catalysts yield different sugar monomers and oligomers, depending on the substrate as well as the process design. The hydrolysis kinetics are typically rather slow, which leads to requirements of long residence times, i.e. slow flow rates, in order to achieve adequate conversion. Hydrolysis experiments of two different polysaccharides - o-acetylgalactoglucomannan (GGM) and inulin - were conducted in an isothermal tubular continuous reactor in laboratory scale, working in the laminar flow regime. A dynamic mass balance-based reactor model was developed, including convection and molecular diffusion in axial and radial directions, as well as the self-accelerating kinetics of the reaction. The model gave a very satisfactory description of the experimental data. The behavior of the laminar flow reactor in the hemicellulose hydrolysis was further illustrated by numerical simulations.

AB Biomass pyrolysis is a promising thermal chemical processing technology to produce renewable and sustainable energy materials. However, the interaction between biomass components (cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin) during pyrolysis process needed further investigation. In this work, an in-situ Reflectance Infrared Fourier Transform Spectroscopy (in-situ DRIFTS) reactor was introduced to investigate the interactions assisted with Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA). The experiments demonstrate that there exist complicated interactions between the main components of biomass during pyrolysis. The results from TGA/DTG indicate that the interactions between cellulose and xylan introduce higher pyrolysis temperature, while the interactions between cellulose and lignin, xylan and lignin, resulte less weight loss. The increase of compression pressure for the mixture of main components changes the weight loss of the mixture. The results from in-situ DRIFTS show that the decomposition and aromatization of xylan are promoted when the cellulose is added. Cellulose will also hinder the accumulation of the benzene rings of the lignin. The in-situ DRIFTS experiment results also suggest that the contact pressure between the components conduct more residue solid, mainly because the dehydration reaction of the mixture samples was inhibited and the charring process was promoted, especially the reaction between cellulose and lignin.

AB A dynamic Bayesian network (DBN) based fault detection, root cause diagnosis, and fault propagation pathway identification scheme is proposed. The proposed methodology generates evidence from monitored process data and uses the information to update the DBN that captures the process knowledge. A new dynamic Bayesian anomaly index (DBAI) based control chart is proposed for detection purpose. Following the detection of the fault(s), root cause(s) is diagnosed using the smoothing inference of a DBN, and fault propagation pathway is identified from the cause-effect relationships among the process variables. The proposed methodology is applied to a binary distillation column and a continuous stirred tank heater (CSTH). The result shows that it can detect the fault and diagnose the root cause of the fault precisely. The result has been compared to the performance of the Shewhart control chart, principal component analysis (PCA) and static BN. The comparative study confirms that the proposed methodology is a more efficient fault detection and diagnosis (FDD) tool. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB A rotating packed bed (RPB) is one of the typical process intensification equipment and its performance can be influenced by the surface wettability of packings. However, tuning the surface wettability of the packing by the surface-modification method is still a challenge due to the extreme physical and chemical environment in RPBs. This work presents a facile strategy for controlling the surface wettability on the stainless steel substrate with a series of highly stable coatings. The water contact angles on the surfaces can be tuned from 75 degrees to 160 degrees. Based on the systematical analysis from the micro-characteristics (surface microstructure and surface free energy) to the macro-wettabilities (water contact angle) of the prepared coatings, the structure-function relationship of these coatings was revealed with wetting models. Application performance testing indicates that the coatings displayed strong adhesion, long-time corrosion resistance, and liquid impinging resistance under high-gravity conditions. This work opens a new avenue to produce highly stable coatings on stainless steel substrates with controllable wettability, which is very helpful to the wettability control for the stainless steel wire mesh packing of RPBs for industrial applications.

AB The hierarchical porous monoliths are important in enhancing diffusion efficiency and reducing pressure drop in heterogeneous catalysis. Here, a practical way to synthesize hierarchical porous covalent organic polymer (COP) monolith by using droplet microfluidic is proposed. The interconnected macro pores (up to similar to 130 nm) were created within intrinsic microporous COP structures by the further condensation of COP particles in the confined microdroplets. Concentration, flow rate ratio, catalyst, etc., were screened to figure out the superior condition for producing different hierarchical porous COP monolith in microfluidic. Rod-like and spherical monolith with gradient sizes were controllable synthesized to satisfy the requirements of different packing density for practical applications. Significantly, our homemade single microreactor is able to produce the spherical hierarchical porous COP monolith with a high space-time yield of 413 kg.m(-3).day(-1) at optimized condition, which provides a promising scale-up method to synthesize COP monoliths for but not limit to industrial heterogeneous catalysis.

AB Low-pressure gas carburizing is used to harden steel, it has been shown to be a source of considerable PAH (Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbon) pollution. Some PAH, like benzo[a]pyrene, are carcinogenic, and activities such as furnace maintenance and cleaning operations may thus represent a risk to workers. Occupational exposure during these operations should therefore be reduced. Benzene is a specific chemical marker of PAH, and the aim of the study was to understand its formation. Acetylene pyrolysis was experimentally performed in a jet-stirred-reactor in the laboratory, in conditions close to those encountered in industrial processes (1173 K and 8 kPa). Products of pyrolysis were analyzed by gas chromatography (TCD, FID) at the outlet from the reaction zone. The influence of residence time in the reactor was studied. A detailed kinetic model assuming an ideal continuous stirred tank reactor was used to describe the formation of chemical compounds and validate experimental data. CFD simulations were performed to characterize the reactor's hydrodynamics by applying the theory of the free jet. They allowed putting forward one explanation to understand the deviation between experiments and the kinetic model. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Two-phase flow in three porous media with different geometry complexities are simulated using the Volume-of-Fluid (VOF) method. The evolution of the flow pattern, as well as the dynamics involved are simulated and compared to experiments. For a simple geometry and smooth solid surface, like single capillary rise experiment, VOF simulation gives results which are in good agreement with the experiments. For a micromodel, with a relatively simple geometry, we can predict the flow pattern while we cannot effectively capture the dynamics of the process in terms of the temporal evolution of flow. With an increase in the geometry complexity in another micromodel, we fail to predict both the flow pattern and the flow dynamics. The reasons for this failure are discussed: interface modeling, pinning of contact line, 3D effects and the sensitivity of the system to initial and boundary conditions. More work regarding benchmarking of pore-scale methods in combination with experiments with different geometry complexities is needed. Also, possibilities and the potential to make better use of the porous media structure data from advanced visualization methods should be addressed. (C) 2018 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

ID ETHYLENE CRACKING; FURNACE; OPERATIONS
AB Olefin plants employ multi-type cracking furnaces in parallel to convert various hydrocarbon feeds into products such as ethylene and propylene. The cracking process of each furnace is a performance-decaying batch operation, which needs periodic shutdowns for decoking operations and thus involves inherently frequent upsets to downstream process. Therefore, the furnace feed allocation, batch processing time and decoking sequence of the entire furnace system must be optimally scheduled to maximize the plant profitability; meanwhile, the induced upset of the main product yields also needs to be restricted within an appropriate range at any time for the sake of the plant operability. Facing this challenge, a new MILP (mixed-integer linear programming) model has been developed in this paper for the upset-conscious scheduling of cracking furnace systems. The study can not only benefit both profitability and operability for the entire olefin plant operation, but also be applied to other continuous parallel-process and performance-decaying unit systems. The efficacy of the developed scheduling model has been demonstrated by various case studies. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This paper presents the results of a study on kinetics and mass transfer in a catalytically coated metallic monolith converter with sinusoidal-shape channels. Hereby, experimental and modelling studies are performed on a commercial Pt-based oxidation catalyst for total oxidation of formaldehyde applicable in after-treatment system of lean-burn gas engines. For the description of flow field and mass transport inside the channel as well as species diffusion and chemical reaction inside the porous washcoat, a three-dimensional approach is applied and the calculations are performed, using ANSYS-FLUENT. Three different computational models representing different washcoat distribution are compared. The effects of washcoat distribution and mass transfer on kinetics and catalyst activity are investigated in detail and the numerically obtained results are compared with experimental data.
   Despite of a very high intrinsic reaction rate at operation temperature, the complete conversion of formaldehyde could not be achieved experimentally. All three models have shown to operate in mass transport limited regime, where the diffusion distance from bulk to catalyst surface as well as reactant concentration play a significant role. Thus, very low levels of formaldehyde emissions are technically hard to achieve and a long catalyst is required to overcome the low diffusion rate due to the small concentration gradient. The computational results indicate also that due to individual structure of each channel of metallic monolith in real applications, they can behave distinctly from each other and one channel does not represent the entire monolith. It is also evident from simulated data that the lack of knowledge of washcoat properties and distribution may bring about misleading results since apparent reaction rates can be highly sensitive to this parameter for particularly catalytic reactions under mass-transfer-controlled conditions.

AB The accurate description of molecular diffusion is important in the design and development of several processes of interest to chemical engineers. Most commonly, a component diffuses down the gradient of its concentration, and Fick's law provides an adequate description for calculation of the fluxes. The major objective of this review article is to highlight a wide variety of processes in which a component is transported uphill, requiring more rigorous models for describing diffusion.
   Uphill diffusion may occur in multicomponent mixtures in which the diffusion flux of any species is strongly coupled to that of partner species. Such coupling effects often arise from strong thermodynamic non-idealities; for a quantitative description we need to use the Maxwell-Stefan formulation with chemical potential gradients as driving forces. Thermodynamic non-idealities are of particular significance for operations close to phase transition regions. A careful and detailed analysis of multicomponent distillation, and extraction processes reveals that Murphree component efficiencies could be "unbounded", i.e. exhibit values less than zero or exceed unity. A characteristic signature of uphill diffusion is the occurrence of transient overshoots in the approach to steady-state; the equilibration trajectories in composition space follow serpentine trajectories. For mixtures of liquids, metals, alloys, ceramics and glasses the serpentine equilibration trajectories could cause forays into meta-stable composition zones; such forays could result in spontaneous emulsification, and the Ouzo effect.
   The transport of ionic species is invariably coupled with its partner ions because of the electroneutrality constraints; such constraints may accelerate or decelerate a specific ion resulting in uphill transport. The forward and reverse kinetics of uptake in ion-exchange resins are asymmetric.
   For mixture separations with microporous adsorbents, uphill diffusion can cause supra-equilibrium loadings to be achieved during transient uptake within crystals; this allows the possibility of overriding adsorption equilibrium for achieving difficult separations.

AB This work presents a numerical model for solids separation using continuously moving, inclined fine mesh filters. One of the main difficulties in modeling fine mesh filters is the characterization of the cake resistance as the solids accumulate on the filter. It is proposed to model the cake resistance using a gravity drainage column experiment implementing continuous water level monitoring. Based on the drainage curve, an analytical formulation is developed for the cake resistance, as a function of the filtered volume per unit area, V. The removal efficiency is also correlated with V through a sieve test. With the cake resistance and removal efficiency functions determined, a one-dimensional filter model is developed. Since the total suspended solids concentration varies as a function of time, and will not always be the same as that tested, a technique of scaling the cake resistance is introduced. A PID control algorithm is also developed into the model, so that the filter rotation speed can be controlled to maintain a set water level upstream of the filter. Results for sizing curves are given, as well as results for the PID controller operation, and validation results based on full-scale pilot testing. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In this study, we propose liquid holdup and pressure drop models for a packed column with structured packing, under offshore conditions. To improve the model performance, we conducted experiments for an air-water system under various conditions (i.e., liquid load, gas load, and permanent tilt angle). We used a column with an inner diameter of 0.6 m and a packed height of 4 m, which was installed on a sloshing machine that enabled us to simulate offshore conditions, and corrected the key parameters of the model based on the experimental data obtained. The result showed that in offshore column design, the rolling motion can be regarded as permanent tilt, by extracting the tilt angle data from the rolling motion characteristics.

AB In the light of the growing renewable energy generation, matching of electricity supply and demand has become increasingly challenging. By participating in demand side management programs, industry can contribute to counter this challenge. However, the frequent adjustment of operation conditions according to volatile electricity prices leads to additional dynamic loads for the equipment. In this work, a mixed-integer linear programming based discrete-time model is proposed for scheduling of a single air separation unit, explicitly considering fatigue of equipment occurring during transient operation. Besides constraints for describing the feasible region and the process dynamics, the model includes constraints for considering mechanical fatigue of some selected key equipment in a simplified way. The resulting model is applied to investigate the impact of mechanical constraints on the potentials of demand side management. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB A water-cooled dual-channel capacitance probe system was developed for in-furnace measurements of solids concentration and solids velocity in a 1 MWth dual fluidized bed pilot plant. Measurements were conducted in both reactors of the pilot plant during carbonate looping and combustion test campaigns. Solids velocities were derived by cross correlating the signals of the two channels of the capacitance probe. Thus, horizontal profiles of solids concentration and velocity were simultaneously determined in the reactors. These profiles show a strong core annulus flow structure in both reactors of the pilot plant. The influence of bed material characteristics, operating conditions as well as riser geometries on the particle flow structure is evaluated. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Substantial amounts of waste cooking oil are obtained worldwide from household and catering enterprises because of deep-frying and other cooking activities. Supercritical water gasification is considered as an aqueous phase reforming process to produce hydrogen enriched syngas from biomass and other organic wastes. In this study, waste cooking oil was gasified at variable temperatures (375-675 degrees C), feed concentration (25-40 wt%) and reaction time (15-60 min) to investigate their effects on syngas yield and composition. Maximum yields of hydrogen (5.16 mol/kg) and total gases (10.5 mol/kg) were obtained at optimal temperature, feed concentration and reaction time of 675 degrees C, 25 wt% and 60 min, respectively. At 5 wt% loading, Ru/Al2O3 enhanced hydrogen yield (10.16 mol/kg) through water-gas shift reaction, whereas Ni/Si-Al2O3 improved methane yield (8.15 mol/kg) via methanation reaction. The trend of hydrogen production from catalytic supercritical water gasification of waste cooking oil at 675 degrees C, 25 wt% and 60 min decreased as Ru/Al2O3 > Ni/Si-Al2O3 > K2CO3 > Na2CO3. The results indicate the recycling potential of waste cooking oil for hydrogen production through hydrothermal gasification. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The optimization and scale-up process of industrial reactors maintaining optimum and homogeneous reaction conditions is a great challenge to engineers. For each final product, process and facility is necessary elaborate suitable strategies in order to allow a comprehensive and detailed process characterization to identify the most relevant process parameters influencing product yield and quality. Despite several research efforts to develop ideal reactors, these studies usually focus on trial-and-error optimization approach. This work was aimed to propose a numerical multiobjective optimization method and its application to the design of a flat-panel airlift (FPA) reactor. A preliminary study of the hydrodynamics of the reactor was conducted in a 61L FPA reactor. Experiments and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations were compared to demonstrate the viability of usage of the simplifications applied to CFD model in order to reduce the computational effort. The inner structure key parameters of a FPA reactor, including the ratio of the cross-section area of the downcomer to the cross-section area of the riser, are optimized vis-a-vis the flow aspects portrayed by the performance parameters, such as shear stress and residence time variations. An in-house computer package was used for the automatic CFD simulations and the optimization process. A Pareto-optimal front with possible solutions to the problem and a detailed investigation of the mixing performance of the possible optimal geometries were presented in the study herein. The results also showed the high influence of the geometric parameters on the hydrodynamics of the FPA reactor, that have to be taken in account in the scaling-up process. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB To get a better understanding of the upgrading of heavy oil under severe hydrothermal environment, a molecular dynamics simulation on the dissolution of oil droplets containing polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) or PAH mixtures in subcritical or supercritical water (sub-CW/SCW) was applied. Being the representative of light PAHs, naphthalene dissolves readily into sub-CW/SCW. The dissolution of heavy PAHs, like benzo[alpha]pyrene and benzo[ghi]perylene however is sensitive to the thermodynamic state of water. During the dissolution of PAH mixtures, a preferential dissolution of light PAHs into the water phase occurs, leaving heavy PAHs concentrated in the oil droplets. With the simultaneous increase in water density and temperature, the miscibility of PAHs with sub-CW/SCW is improved by the enhanced attractive electrostatic interaction between PAHs and hydrothermal environment and the weakened interaction between PAHs. By the differences in heavy oil composition and the thermodynamic state of water, the upgrading of heavy oil in sub-CW/SCW could be run in the condensed emulsion or pseudo single-phase structure.

AB Eulerian-Eulerian two-fluid computational fluid dynamic (CFD) models are increasingly used to predict bubbly flows at an industrial scale. In these approaches, interface transfer is modelled with closure models and correlations. Normally, the lateral void fraction distribution is considered to mainly result from a balance between the lift and wall lubrication forces. However, and despite the numerous models available that achieve, at least in pipe flows, a reasonable predictive accuracy, agreement on a broadly applicable and accurate modelling approach has not yet been reached. Additionally, the impact of turbulence modelling on the lateral void fraction distribution has not, in general, been examined in detail. In this work, an elliptic blending Reynolds stress model (EB-RSM), capable of resolving the turbulence field in the near-wall region and improved to account for the contribution of bubble-induced turbulence, is evaluated against best-practice k-epsilon and high-Reynolds second-moment turbulence closures. Lift and wall lubrication forces are initially deliberately neglected in the EB-RSM. Comparisons for flows in pipes and a square duct show that the EB-RSM reproduces the lateral void fraction distribution, including the peak in the void fraction in the near-wall region, and reaches an accuracy comparable to the other two models noted above. In rod bundles, even if none of the models considered performs with sufficient accuracy, the EB-RSM detects features of the flow that are not predicted by the other two approaches. Overall, the results demonstrate a much more prominent role of the turbulence structure and the induced cross-sectional pressure field on the lateral void fraction distribution than is normally considered. These effects need to be accounted for if more physically-consistent modelling of bubbly flows is to be achieved. The lift force is added to the EB-RSM in the final part of the paper, to provide a two-fluid formulation that can be used as the basis for additional developments aimed at improving the accuracy and general applicability of two-fluid CFD models.

AB Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are attracting more and more attention among all the air pollutants. Photocatalytic oxidation under vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) irradiation presents a novel and promising process for VOC degradation while also generating ozone as a byproduct. To improve the degradation efficiency of VOCs and remove the residual ozone Mn-TiO2/mesoporous CeO2 composite catalysts were developed and used as a catalyst in a VUV-PCO system for toluene degradation. Characterizations including SEM, TEM, BET, XRD, XPS, Raman and H-2-TPR, were conducted to examine the physical and chemical features of the synthetic samples. Results of a toluene degradation test showed that the Mn-TiO2/CeO2 catalyst had superior activity in removing toluene and ozone to Mn-TiO2 and pure CeO2. The toluene removal efficiencies of the catalysts with a different molar ratio of Ti/Ce were found to be in the order of Mn-TiO2/CeO2 (1:1) > Mn-TiO2/CeO2 (1:2) > Mn-TiO2/CeO2 (2:1). The mineralization rate increased in the order of Mn-TiO2/CeO2 (1:1) > Mn-TiO2/CeO2 (2:1) approximate to Mn-TiO2 > Mn-TiO2/CeO2 (1:2) > CeO2 > VUV photolysis. High ozone removal rates of over 99.9% were obtained for all the doped samples with Mn, resulting in a residual ozone lower than 0.12 ppm. With the use of the scavenger tert-butanol (TBA) and the electron spin resonance (ESR) test, hydroxyl radicals ((OH)-O-center dot) were found to play a significant role in toluene oxidation in the VUV-PCO process and ozone is also involved in the formation of (OH)-O-center dot.

TI Mechanistic model to simulate wet agglomerate breakage in a gas-solid
   fluidized bed
SO CHEMICAL ENGINEERING SCIENCE
LA English
DT Article
ID GRANULATION; IMPACT; GROWTH
AB A mathematical model that describes wet agglomerate breakage in a gas-solid fluidized bed was developed, utilizing the energy approach to assess agglomerate stability and the Kinetic Theory of Granular Flows (KTGF) to describe collisions between bed primary particles and agglomerates. Wet agglomerates are held together by liquid bridges that resist breakage due to capillary and viscous forces. The probability of breakage depends on the balance between the collisional energy and the energy required to break the necessary number of liquid bridges. The model considers two types of breakage: abrasion, characterized by individual primary particles being stripped from an agglomerate, and fragmentation, where an agglomerate breaks into two pieces, each containing multiple primary particles. Simulations were performed using the Eulerian-Eulerian method with either a monodispersed or a polydispersed approach to describe the size distribution of agglomerates during breakage. Comparison with available experimental data revealed good qualitative agreement between the predicted and measured abrasion and fragmentation rates, with some quantitative discrepancies that can be attributed to model limitations and experimental uncertainties. The effects of superficial gas velocity and liquid viscosity on agglomerate breakage are investigated in detail. The model can serve as a valuable tool to study breakage of wet agglomerates, and it can be extended to include agglomerate formation for a more comprehensive description of hydrodynamics of wet fluidized beds.

TI Piezoelectric-based high performance spray solvent delivery system for
   desorption electrospray ionization mass spectrometry: Systematic design
   and case studies for high throughput screening of N-alkylation reactions
SO CHEMICAL ENGINEERING SCIENCE

DT Article

   controller synthesis
ID CRYSTAL
AB Desorption electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (DESI-MS) is a powerful tool for ultra-high throughput chemical reaction screening having enormous scientific and practical implications. DESIMS enables considerably faster chemical reaction and/or product discovery than most current screening methods using very small amount of materials. It has the advantage of bringing the reagents in contact inside charged micro-droplets, that can accelerate reaction by compared to bulk or flow reaction approaches. Since both the desorption efficiency from the surface and the reaction kinetics can be significantly influenced by the DESI spray solvent flowrate and composition, these parameters are expected to play key roles in the overall performance of the ultrahigh-throughput screening. Syringe pumps are frequently used to deliver the DESI spray. They are robust, but inflexible and slow when it comes to manipulating solvent composition and varying flowrate setpoints. This study addresses the importance of designing a high performance, flexible solvent delivery system that enables more rapid solvent composition and flowrate setpoint changes than the routinely used syringe pumps. Our system utilizes a piezoelectric-based pressure controller and valve system employed with fine-tuned adaptive proportional-integrative-derivative (PID) controller. N-alkylation reactions were used to demonstrate the impact of spray-solvent composition and flowrate on the DESI-MS outcome. In particular, the results showed that ions resulting from solvent mixtures can induce reactions that would be otherwise unobserved when using the corresponding neat solvents. This further signifies the need for a flexible spray-solvent delivery system with fast dynamics in the context of ultra-high throughput DESI-MS analysis. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID POLYMER; PERSPECTIVES
AB Structuring of particles obtained by aerosol photopolymerization is here described from both the experimental and the simulation point of view. Transport phenomena occurring within aerosol droplets are studied in order to identify the key issues that must be carefully designed when considering particles structuring. In particular, phase separation and diffusion of the reacting species were evaluated using molecular dynamics simulations, allowing the identification of a series of formulation parameters such as the composition of a mixed solvent (hexadecane and 2-octanone) or the addition of a chain transfer reagent, which are crucial for the control of phase separation and, thus, of the final morphology of the microparticles. The results were compared with morphology analyses obtained from the experimental work. We also found that molecular simulations were useful for the decoupling of the effects of different solvents which were thus treated separately. The interplay between phase separation and gelation rates was also found to be crucial in the structuring process. For example, the ratio between hexadecane and a chain transfer reagent seemed to strongly affect the final morphology of micro-particles. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB We studied the catalytic hydrogenation of CO2 to methane using nickel-niobia composite catalysts. Catalysts containing 10-70 wt% Ni were synthesized by wet impregnation and tested for CO 2 hydrogenation in a flow reactor. 40 wt% was found to be the optimum Ni loading, which resulted in CO2 conversion of 81% at 325 degrees C. We also calcined the Nb2O5 support at different temperatures to study the influence of calcination temperature on the catalytic performance. 40 wt% Ni loaded on Nb-2 O-5, which was calcined at 700 degrees C gave higher methanation activity (91% conversion of CO2). Time on stream study for 50 h showed a stable activity and selectivity; thus confirming the scope for practical application. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB The fabrication of stable Ni active species over the high heat-transfer support is essential for the Ni-based catalysts in CO2 methanation to resist sintering and remove the reaction heat. A metal-structured Ni-SiO2/GO-Ni-foam catalyst was synthesized via intercalation of graphene oxide (GO) to facilitate the synthesis of stable nickel silicates on Ni-foam, which exhibited excellent activity and stability in the high-temperature (e.g., 470 degrees C) CO2 methanation. Characterization results suggested that the intercalated graphene over the Ni-foam contributed to a stronger metal-support interaction on the metal-structured catalyst due to the connective function of GO between the Ni-foam and nickel silicates. The formation of nickel silicates on GO lead to high dispersion of Ni sites and high amount of surface OH groups for elimination of carbon deposition. Density functional theory study revealed that the graphene modified the electronic structure of surface Ni, and contributed to an increase of CO2 adsorption energy, Ni-4 binding energy with support, and a decrease of H-2 and CO2 dissociation energy, and thus led to a high reactivity for CO2 methanation.

AB The formation and reactivity of carbon on the supported nickel catalyst is a key issue for the low temperature activity and stability with methanation, reforming and other reactions. In this work, Ni(1 1 1)/TiO2 was prepared and applied as the catalyst to deposit carbon using low temperature chemical vapor deposition (CVD) of carbon monoxide. It was found that the CVD temperature could significantly affect the formation of carbon. With the CVD temperature decreasing, the disorder of the carbon increased, while the degree of graphitization was reduced. As a result, graphene-like films can be obtained at low CVD temperatures (from 300 to 350 degrees C). Such carbon films show a significantly improved reactivity with hydrogen and carbon dioxide. This explains the excellent low temperature activity and stability for CO2 or CO methanation over Ni catalysts with Ni(1 1 1). (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Highly selective electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction to valuable chemical products is a crucial approach to alleviate the energy crisis. To date, some noble metal based heterogeneous catalysts such as Pd exhibit high activity for electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction. However, few systematic studies of the active reaction site of these catalysts have been reported. This paper describes the facet effect on Pd nanocrystals with the same size for CO2 electroreduction. The surface structure of Pd catalysts enclosed with {3 1 0}, {1 0 0} and {1 1 1} facets can be precisely controlled. The Pd concave cubes enclosed with high-index {3 1 0} facets show the highest CO Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 90.6%, compared with Pd cubes enclosed with {1 0 0} facets and Pd octahedrons enclosed with {1 1 1} facets. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the {3 1 0} facets of concave cubes boost the catalytic activity by facilitating the COOH* formation and the desorption of CO*.

AB Graphitic carbon materials have shown great potential for use as high-performance catalysts for electrochemical reactions and devices. In this work, we developed a simple and versatile method for synthesis of porous N-doped graphene layers (NGS) by high-temperature treatment of chitosan film deposited on the graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) nanosheets. In the sandwiched chitosan/g-C3N4/chitosan structure, the g-C3N4 nanosheet served as a substrate for chitosan film. The pyrolysis of this substrate, g-C3N4 nanosheet, prevented the severe agglomeration of as-carbonized chitosan sheets and resulted the porous structure. The BET surface area, micropore volume, nitrogen content and graphitic level of result sample highly depended on the heat-treatment temperature. The NGS synthesized at 1000 degrees C (NGS-1000) exhibited an ultrahigh specific surface area (1183 m(2) g( 1)) and high nitrogen content (4.12%). Importantly, NGS-1000 exhibited a higher limiting current density (5.8 mA cm( 2)) and a greater stability than the commercial Pt/C electrocatalyst in alkaline media for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Such excellent electrocatalytic performance can be explained by a balanced combination of appropriate nitrogen doping level, the degree of graphitization, porous structure, and high specific surface area.

AB Cobalt and nitrogen co-doped reduced graphene oxide (Co-N-rGO) composites are prepared by a facile low-temperature hydrothermal method. Structure characterization reveals that cobalt and nitrogen are co-ordinately attached to the rGO sheets with the formation of covalent C-N and Co-O-C linkages. Cyclic voltammetry and linear sweep voltammetry show that the Co-N-rGO composite possesses higher electrocatalytic activity and four-electron selectivity for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) as compared to the rGO, Co-rGO and N-rGO. In addition, the Co-N-rGO composite presents excellent stability and durability in alkaline medium comparable to commercial Pt/C. The edge plane CoN2/C, CoN4/C, and basal plane macrocyclic CoN4/C species within the Co-N-rGO structure are proposed to be the active sites performing catalysis in the ORR. The strong covalent linkages between the cobalt/nitrogen and rGO not only enable potent synergy of cobalt, nitrogen and rGO in catalysis, but also ensure structure stability of the composite. Due to the superior ORR activity of Co-N-rGO, high-temperature heat treatment is not able to improve its activity any more. The low-temperature hydrothermal method is anticipated to be used as a low-cost and facile preparation approach for ORR catalysts, and the superb ORR performance of Co-N-rGO endow it with great application potential in fuel cells, metal-air batteries and other ORR-related electrochemical industries.

AB Embedding a single atom into the supported catalysts is the most effective way to maximize the catalytic efficiency, holding promise for developing low-cost electrocatalysts. Grain boundaries in graphene display unique structures and have attracted great research efforts in electronic properties, catalysis and sensors. By using density function theory (DFT) calculations, we systematically investigated the potential of a single transition metal (TM) atom (TM = Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Ag, Au, Pt) supported on the experimentally realised 558 grain boundary (GB), as a highly efficient electrocatalyst for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). We find that the Fe, Co, Ni and V atom anchored on 558 GB can substantially tune the free energy of hydrogen adsorption to a more optimal value, especially for the V atom (Delta G H = -0.01 eV), which is very close to, or even better than the most active Pt and MoS2 catalysts. This feature is attributed to the charge transfer between TM atom and the adsorbed H atom, which significantly promotes the proton adsorption and the reduction of kinetics. In addition, a large number of electronic states near the Fermi level ensure efficient electron transfer. Our study may provide a new cost-effective, highly active and earth-abundant HER electrocatalyst for hydrogen production. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB AlH3 (alane) is considered as an ideal one-off compact hydrogen storage material thanks to its high storage capacity and moderate decomposition temperature. However, application has been hindered by the lack of direct hydrogen reversibility, i.e. regeneration of AlH3 directly from the reaction of spent Al with hydrogen under mild conditions. Herein, we investigated the effect of nanoconfinement on the properties of AlH(3 )and the potential of this approach toward the direct release and uptake of hydrogen by nanosized Al. AlH(3 )was confined within the mesopores of a high surface area graphite (HSAG). The decomposition of the nanoconfined AlH(3 )was detected 50 degrees C lower than the bulk, showing some effect of nanoconfinement on the overall temperature for hydrogen release. Some hydrogen uptake was also observed at 150 degrees C and 60 bar hydrogen pressure, and this indicates that reversible release of hydrogen with alane under moderate conditions of pressure and temperature may be possible.

CdS/WC exhibits high abilities in absorbing visible light which is the main part of the sunlight (44%) and in separating the photogenerated electron-hole pairs. The H-2 evolution rate in the visible-light-driven photocatalytic H2O splitting on CdS/WC (1331.7 mu mol h(-1)) is much higher than those on the photocatalysts formed by combining the CdS nanoparticles with WC nanoparticles (739.6 mu mol h(-1)) and with Pt nanoparticles (556.3 mu mol h(-1)). The enhanced electron-hole separation and subsequent transfer of the charge carriers on CdS/WC is responsible for the higher H-2 evolution rate on CdS/WC. These results are helpful for preparing noble-metal-free photocatalysts for more efficient photocatalysis. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Graphitic carbon nitride (CN) enriched with ZnO or Fe2O3 were synthesized using a simple one-pot mechanochemical method. By using this method, composite samples were synthetized without the production of any potentially hazardous waste. Synthesized materials were used as catalysts during selective photo-oxidation of benzyl alcohol. Both composite materials displayed an enhancement of activity and benzaldehyde selectivity with respect to the pure CN. The most active catalyst was Fe2O3/g-C3N4(Fe/CN). Conversion and benzaldehyde selectivity of this sample were 20 and 70%, respectively. It showed a considerable increase of benzaldehyde selectivity compared to the pure CN and TiO2 P25 commercial reference. A complete structural and electronic characterization using Scanning Electron Microscopy-Energy Dispersive (SEM-EDX), BET measurements, X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray Photoelectron (XPS), and UV-visible spectroscopies was carried out. The characterization analysis pointed out the leading role of the crystallinity and surface concentration over the activity and benzaldehyde selectivity of the reaction. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Nitrogen doping of graphene with systematically controlled dopant content and distribution of nitrogen species is demonstrated to improve the size distribution of the deposited platinum (Pt) nanoparticles. While the dopant content can be tuned by varying the urea dosage, the doped nitrogen species (namely pyridinic N, pyrrolic N, and graphitic N) can be controlled through the annealing temperature. Chemically reduced Pt nanoparticles were found to be evenly distributed on the nitrogen-doped graphene sheets (NRGO) with particle size centred at 2.7 nm. In comparison, the decoration of Pt on the non-doped graphene (RGO) yielded a composite material with larger Pt (7.8 nm) and poorer size distribution. The loading of Pt nanoparticles is shown to correlate with the concentration of the nitrogen dopant, in particular that of the graphitic N species. Owing to the smaller and better distributed Pt nanoparticles which facilitated more active sites for reaction, the Pt-loaded NRGO photocatalytically generated H-2 gas ten times higher than that of Pt-loaded RGO when coupled with photoactive graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4).

AB The anthropogenic rise of carbon emissions has led to increased interest in the innovative utilisation of CO2. CO2 reduction via the Sabatier reaction presents a thermodynamically favourable pathway to reduce CO2; however, to date, there has been a lack of understanding of how plasmonic enhancement may be utilised for this reaction particularly with respect to the role of bimetallic catalysts. In this study, the effect of laser light illumination on Ni-Au/SiO2 , at 520 nm and 660 nm, was studied for CO2 reduction over a temperature range of 150 degrees C to 450 degrees C, with the catalytic performance being assessed by CO2 conversion along with CH4 and CO selectivity. Under laser light illumination, at 520 nm and 450 degrees C, CO2 conversion for Ni-Au/SiO2 increased by 79% whilst simultaneously lowering CH4 selectivity, which was attributed to localised surface plasmon resonance effects and promotion of the reverse water-gas shift reaction by the Au. Laser light illumination at 660 nm also introduced a mild conversion increase, however not to the same extent as for 520 nm. XPS analysis of Ni-Au/SiO2 implied that the observed photo-enhancement could be due to plasmonic mediated electron charge transfer from the Au deposits to the Ni deposits. Monometallic Ni and Au samples were examined and compared with the bimetallic system to elucidate the origin of the photo enhancement and to understand the plasmonic and catalytic interactions. The Au/SiO2 and Ni/SiO2 samples demonstrated that the photo-enhancement arose from the presence of the Au, with the increase in CO2 conversion at 520 nm increasing with increasing Au content; Au (similar to 110%) > NiAu (similar to 80%) > Ni (similar to 21%). However, the overall better performance of the Ni/SiO2 sample, facilitating high CO2 conversion and CH4 selectivity emphasises that, while plasmonic metal inclusion can induce synergistic effects, the benefits can be muted if it is unable to promote the target reaction.

AB CuNiOS bimetal oxysulfide catalysts with catalytic activity in the dark were synthesized by a feasible solution method below 100 degrees C. It has a hexagonal CuS covellite structure with the Cu+/(Cu++Cu2+) molar ratio above 0.6. S6+ was formed to balance the deficiency in positive charge due to a high Cu+ content. The effect of hydrazine (N2H4) amount added during the CuNiOS synthesis on the redox reactions was evaluated. The N2H4-free CuNiOS showed the fast methylene blue (MB) degradation capability and the [N2H4]-high CuNiOS had the high Cr(VI) reduction capability all in the dark condition. The adjustable redox reactions by the CuNiOS catalyst system are demonstrated and explained. The catalytic reaction mechanism is elucidated, depending upon the Cu+/Cu2+ ratio for different charge transports. CuNiOS also exhibited relatively good stability and durability during its reusability tests. The catalytic reactions under the mild conditions without heat and electrical and thermal energies are encouraging for green synthesis. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Calcium manganese oxides have captured strong scientific interest in recent years due to exceptional catalytic activities, inexpensive synthesis methods, and constitution of earth abundant and environmentally benign elements. In particular, the catalytic properties of Ca-Mn-O systems have been recognised as a potentially useful new tool in addressing energy and environmental problems. This article presents an overview of new developments in the research on Ca-Mn-O catalyst materials. The article begins with the discussion about the CaMn4O5(H2O)(4) cluster which is situated within Photosystem II proteins in plant cells and is responsible for the natural water-splitting reaction. It then focuses on the crystal structures and synthesis routes of various Ca-Mn-O systems, followed by a critical discussion on the applications in catalytic water oxidation. Other known applications of Ca-Mn-O systems in the energy and environmental sectors are also discussed. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Driven by the intensified demand for energy storage systems with high-energy density and safety, allsolid-state zinc (Zn) air batteries have drawn extensive attentions. However, the development of non-precious metals with high catalytic activity as the air electrode is still a big challenge. In this work, we realize the large-scale fabrication of single-crystal CoO nanorods with high active facets and abundant oxygen vacancies in-situ on conductive substrate, which exhibits superior electrocatalytic activity in both oxygen reduction reaction and oxygen evolution reaction. The all-solid-state Zn-air batteries assembled with such free-standing CoO NRs show low charge/discharge overpotentials, a high energy density and a high cyclic stability. Our work indicates that the rational structure design of catalysts can pave a new route to next generation efficient and durable electrochemical devices. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Composite nanowires incorporating both metal oxide and metal nanoparticles as the basic building units are attracting much attention recently. We report here a facile approach to synthesize 3D networks of 1D nanowires of formed by both NiO and Ni nanoparticle. The composite nanowires were in-situ synthesized on carbonized eggshell membrane. Here, alpha-Ni(OH)(2) nanowire precursor was synthesized on eggshell membrane under mild conditions in a diaphragm-assisted reactor first. Then the precursor was transformed into composite of NiO-Ni nanowires on carbonized eggshell membrane under heat treatment in argon. The eggshell membrane played multiple roles as the substrate to collect the alpha-Ni(OH)(2) nanowire precursor and then as the source of reducing agents to partially reduce to Ni2+ to Ni-0. When tested for lithium-ion batteries, the composite of 3D networks NiO-Ni nanowires attached on carbonized eggshell membrane demonstrated impressively improved rate and cycling performances, as compared to that of bare NiO nanowires. The idea and method outline here based on bio-inspired synthesis using bio-template to prepare composites could be applied to synthesize other functional materials. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

TI Graphene oxide-modified zinc anode for rechargeable aqueous batteries

AB Li-based batteries are intrinsically unsafe because of their use of flammable organic electrolyte. Great efforts are being made to develop solid electrolytes or safer alternative battery chemistries, among which Zn-based batteries stand out for their high energy density and good compatibility with aqueous electrolyte. Theoretically, Zn-air batteries have very high volumetric energy density, which is similar to 85% of that of Li-S batteries. However, Zn anodes have poor cycling performance because of their passivation (insulating discharge product ZnO) and dissolution (soluble zinc species in alkaline electrolytes) problems.
   In this work, we overcome these problems by modifying Zn anode with graphene oxide (Zn@GO) by a facile solution casting method. The GO layers on the Zn surface can deliver electrons across insulating ZnO, slow down the Zn intermediates from dissolving into the electrolyte, and thereby enhance the utilization and rechargeability of Zn anodes. As a result, the Zn@GO anode containing only 1.92 wt% GO showed improved cycling performance compared to that of the unmodified Zn mesh. The accumulated areal discharge capacity of the Zn@GO anode is 128% of that of the unmodified Zn mesh. The Zn@GO anode reported here can potentially be paired with oxygen cathode to form safe high-energy rechargeable batteries, and be used in large scale applications, ranging from electric vehicles, to grid-scale energy storage. The surface modification method reported here can also potentially be applied to other high-capacity electrodes that undergo passivation or dissolution issues. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Lithium-sulfur (Li-S) battery is a promising candidate for the next-generation power sources due to their low-cost and high energy density. However, the shuttle effect of the dissolved polysulfides in the electrolyte solvents has hindered the commercialization of Li-S batteries. In order to effectively suppress the shuttle effect, we design and prepare a bybrid graphene album structure as an efficient polysulfides-trapped host for Li-S battery. In this composite, the graphene album structure is stacked by graphene layer by layer through a bottom-up assembly, which provides a hierarchical porous structure, easy mass transport and excellent conductivity for the cathode host of Li-S batteries. The uniform g-C3N4 layer was in-situ generated on each graphene by hydrothermal treatment and heat polycondensation. The orderly bybrid graphene album (coded as g-C3N4@n-G) achieves the two-dimensional surface adsorption interaction for imobilizing soluble polysulfides, and the multilayer barriers also effectively prevent the escape of polysulfides to enhance the long cycling stability of Li-S batteries. As a result, an extremely low capacity decay of 0.028% cycle(-1) and a high initial capacity of 1252 mA h g(-1) have been achieved at 0.2 C. Furthermore, this kind of unique design and preparation method for hybrid graphene album also opens an opportunity for the construction of other album-like graphene-based hybrids.

AB Oxidative chemical vapor deposition (oCVD) offers unique advantages in synthesizing and integrating conducting polymers, like polyaniline (PANI), over conventional solution-based techniques, among them its ability to achieve thin films, conformal and uniform coatings, and coatings on topologically complex substrates. In this work, PANI was synthesized by oCVD via oxidative polymerization using aniline monomer and antimony pentachloride oxidant. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) confirm the formation of PANI. Uniquely, as evidenced by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM), oCVD PANI shows a rough nanoporous morphology with pore openings of around 20 nm, while maintaining the conformality and uniformity of the coating. This nanoscale porosity leads to greater surface area that enhanced the energy storage capacity of nonporous electrospun carbon nanofibers (CNFs). With a coating thickness of similar to 160 nm on CNFs, the oCVD PANI-CNF composite shows high specific capacitance and excellent cycling stability, and demonstrates the potential for porous oCVD PANI to enhance supercapacitor energy storage and power density.

AB The permeability of porous media is one of the critical parameters that determines gas recovery from natural gas hydrate reservoirs. We measured the permeability of quartz sands by injecting water at a certain flow rate. In hydrate-bearing sands, the larger the hydrate saturation, the smaller the shape factor in the presence of hydrate. A k(r) - S-H relationship with the hydrate saturation both lower and higher than 10% was obtained. Based on the experimental results, the saturation exponent n varied from 6.0 to 1.0.

AB Based on the bionic fractal theory, a fractal tree-like photobioreactor (PBR) with high surface area to volume ratio is designed on the basis of bifurcation tree algorithm and manufactured via 3D printing technology. Numerical simulation and experimental results show that the fractal structure has a good flow performance and can lead to secondary flow, which is beneficial to enhance the turbulence and produce smaller bubble sizes. Chlorella culture in the fractal tree-like PBR has a higher Fv/Fm (Chlorophyll fluorescence parameter), close to 0.767, and higher efficiency of photosynthetic growth as well as CO2 capture, compared with multitubular PBR and conventional acrylic column reactors. Therefore, the fractal tree-like PBR can improve the efficiency of light energy utilization and bioreaction. Combined with 3D printing technology, fractal PBR blazes a new trail for process intensification on the microalgae cultivation. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Supported ionic liquid membranes (SILMs) constitute a radical advance in olefin/paraffin separation membranes. Unfortunately, the applications of SILMs are vastly hindered by low carrier efficiency. Herein, SILMs with high carrier efficiency via strong hydrogen-bond basicity were designed to carry out efficient ethylene/ethane separation. The strong hydrogen-bond basicity of ILs not only endowed the membranes with high carrier concentration, but also effectively favored for the good disassociation of carrier to form solvated free ions through coordinative interactions between IL and carrier, which greatly increased the number of carrier and enhanced the carrier efficiency. Benefiting from the high carrier efficiency, both ethylene permeability and ethylene/ethane selectivity were significantly elevated, which could reach up to 100 Barrers and 40, respectively, surpassing most of results reported in the open literature. Meanwhile, the ethylene and ethane solubility data in the carrier/ILs were measured in a pressure range from 0 to 3.5 bar at 298.15 K, a first-order equilibrium model based on the formation carrier-ethylene complex species has been developed to describe the physical and chemical dissolving behaviors of ethylene and the equilibrium constants were obtained accordingly. Moreover, the membrane separation process was optimized, confirming that ethylene permeability and ethylene/ethane selectivity increased with the increase of carrier concentration due to the combined effects of gas solubility and diffusion. It was notable that the selectivity of as-prepared SILMs was more effective at lower transmembrane pressures and operating temperatures, which contributed to designing the energy-efficient and sustainable membrane processes. This study opens a new route for the utilization of the IL properties to manipulate the carrier efficiency for developing high performance SILMs. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB A numerical simulation on the rise behaviour of a bubble rising in stagnant water at Re approximate to 800-1300 has been conducted. It is found that vorticity generated at the side of the bubble is transferred to the wake region, forming chains of hairpin vortices that are regularly shed and transported downstream. The resulting fluctuations in shape, trajectory, and rise velocity were found to conform well to experimental observations. The fluctuations in velocity resulting from the unsteady wakes were analysed through a fixed-frame approach about the centre of mass of the bubble. The average turbulent kinetic energy in the near wake region was found to be approximate to 1.4-4.8%with respect to the average kinetic energy of the bubble. The production of the turbulent kinetic energy was found to occur predominantly at the near wake region of the bubble, mostly as a result of normal and tangential gradients of the mean streamwise velocity. Interestingly, several regions of negative rate of energy production were identified, namely at the top and side interfaces of the bubble. Overall, the ratio of positive-to-negative production rate was found to be approximate to 2.4-3.1 resulting in a net conversion towards smaller-scale fluctuations from the mean flow. Small-scale dissipation was found to occur throughout the wake of the bubble. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Culture of mammalian or human cells in Wave bioreactor is widely used for cell expansion or for biologics manufacturing. Wave bioreactor cultivation of sensitive cells such as stem cells, immune cells or anchorage-dependent cells, is recognized as an attractive option for culture in suspension or adherently on microcarriers. A systematic optimization of the mixing, oxygen transfer rate and shear stress, most favorable for the cells requires a deep understanding of the hydrodynamics inside the Wave bioreactor bag, i.e. cellbag. Numerical simulation by Computation Fluid Dynamics (CFD), is considered as an inexpensive and efficient tool for predicting the fluid behavior in many fields. In the present study, we perform numerical simulations by Ansys-FLUENT to characterize the flow conditions in a 10 L cellbag. The numerical simulations are carried out to investigate the fluid structures for nine different operating conditions of rocking speed and angle. The influence of these operating parameters on the mixing and the shear stress induced by the liquid motion are studied. We find that the mixing and shear stress increase with the cellbag angle from 4 degrees to 7 degrees but that increasing rocking speeds are not systematically associated with increasing mixing and shear stress. It is concluded that a resonance phenomenon is responsible for the fact that the lowest studied rocking speed, 15 rpm, generates the highest fluid velocity, mixing and shear stress compared to the higher speeds of 22 and 30 rpm.

AB The Lattice Boltzmann Method (LBM) has been known as a promising approach for simulating the deformable moving interface of multiphase fluid phenomena due to its mesoscopic nature in organizing and executing distribution functions. However, LBMs are limited in simulating real gas-liquid bubbly flows, where the numerical inaccuracy and instability may significantly increase due to the high surface tension force and the large density ratio. In this paper, a mass-conserving LBM model is developed. The proposed model introduces a conserving correction step and an effective surface tension formula to improve physical accuracy, and utilizes a Multiple-Relaxation-Time (MRT) D3Q19 (three-dimensional and 19 discrete direction) operator to increase numerical stability. The proposed model was applied to estimate bubble behaviors, dimensionless parameter correlations, and drag force coefficient. The results were compared with analytical results, existing numerical results, and experimental data in literature and performed. The good agreement indicates that the proposed mass-conserving LBM model has the ability to predict bubble behaviors in the gas-liquid system. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Drop impact on small cylindrical targets has been experimentally studied. Special attention has been drawn to the effect of the different target-to-drop diameters ratio on the evolution of the drop spreading after colliding with the surface. Three distinct regions have been identified as related to the ratio of the target-to-drop diameters (beta(t)  D-t/D-0), and the maximum spreading to drop diameters beta(max)  D-ma/D-0. The particular response of each type group was analyzed to define the specific spreading characteristics. The small target is an obstacle on the drop way, yet it does not stop its vertical velocity completely, as for the larger surfaces. A drop that impacts a small target continues to flow, not only radially but with some vertical velocity, in accordance with an appropriate energy balance. The analysis yielded expressions for the maximal spread of each impact type. Type-A was observed for (1 < beta(t) <= beta(max)) and demonstrated mainly a radial spread, type-B (1/2 < beta(t) <= 1) with two directional spread; radial and vertical, and type-C for (beta(t) <= 1/2) a very small obstacle which barely affects the drop flow. The present analysis yielded expressions for the maximal spread of each impact type. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The reduction reaction of copper oxide with CH4 is highly exothermic and can be arranged to generate sufficient heat to in-situ calcine calcium carbonate and produce a highly concentrated stream of CO2. This concept is tested at TRL4 in a packed-bed reactor operated close to adiabatic conditions. The impact of the initial solids temperature and the inlet flowrate of the gases is evaluated. A 50/50 (vol.%) mixture of methane and hydrogen (i.e., a possible composition of the PSA-off gas generated in a reforming process) has also been used as reducing gas. The presence of H2 reduces the CuO/CaCO3 proportion required in the bed and promotes the calcination at temperatures lower than 870 degrees C. The experimental measurements are well predicted by a one-dimensional fixed-bed reactor model, in which the steam methane reforming, water-gas-shift, carbon deposition and carbon gasification reactions are also considered. Different characterization techniques (i.e., SEM, XRD, N-2 adsorption, TPR) demonstrate that both commercial CuO- and CaO-based materials show good stability after successive cyclic experiments.

AB In times of energy revolution, bioelectrochemistry is a growing field of research, either for the generation of electrical energy from organic substrates or the use of electrical energy to produce various products. By now, this technology is on the turning point from lab scale to industrial applications. Unfortunately, there is still a lack of well characterized, scalable reactor systems that are capable of hosting different bioelectrochemical processes, linking lab scale research to industrial application. In this paper, we introduce a two-chamber bioelectrochemical bubble-column reactor (one liter working volume), which can be used as microbial fuel cell as well as for microbial electrosynthesis and is especially advantageous for processes with gaseous substrates. It is designed flexible in terms of electrode material and area, membrane material and area, and capable of hosting continuous processes. It is a promising replacement of lab-scale H-cells for wider screening possibilities with regard to industrial applications. We characterized the reactor by giving key values such as Ito and gas hold up, and suggest scale-up parameters. These are, for example, dimensionless numbers like Reynolds and Wagner number and different ratios that should be kept constant during scale-up. Therefore, this paper can be a guideline for the development and scale-up of bioelectrochemical systems. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Precise and rational control of droplet size distribution (DSD) is important in emulsification for target-oriented product design. To develop a complete DSD model, crossing the two mesoscales of two different levels is of great significance, viz., the emulsifier adsorption at interfacial level (Mesoscale 1) and the droplet breakage and coalescence in turbulence in rotor-stator device level (Mesoscale 2). While the first mesoscale can be simulated by coarse-grained molecular dynamic (CGMD), the second has been investigated in computational fluid dynamics and population balance model (CFD-PBM) simulation through the Energy-Minimization Multi-Scale (EMMS) approach in Part I. We then developed a model framework in Part II, coupling CGMD and CFD-PBM simulation through surfactant transport equations in bulk phase and at interface, with source terms taking account of emulsifier adsorption parameters. The parameters including maximal adsorption amount, diffusion coefficient and adsorption/desorption kinetic constants are acquired from CGMD. The coalescence efficiency is then corrected by the interfacial area fraction not occupied by surfactant and fed into the coalescence kernel functions in PBM. Compared to traditional CFD-PBM simulation, the coupled model can greatly improve the simulation of DSD, Sauter mean diameter, median diameter and span for high dispersed phase amount (DPA), and correctly reflect the influence of DPA, surfactant concentration and rotational speed of rotor-stator (RS) devices. While the simulation cases validate and demonstrate the advantage of this new model framework, it is also promising to incorporate different types of surfactant in future. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Droplet size distribution represents one of the key parameters of emulsification products and emulsification efficiency. While there is a large number of computational fluid dynamics and population balance model (CFD-PBM) simulation for droplet size distribution in various emulsification devices, fitting parameters or empirical correlations were always involved to generate the reasonable simulation. In this study, we applied the Energy-Minimization Multi-scale (EMMS) approach for the liquid-liquid flow in rotor-stator (RS) mixing devices. The so-called mesoscale energy dissipation for droplet breakage was derived to close the population balance equations through a breakage rate corrector. The correction factor was then integrated into the fully-coupled CFD-PBM simulation for a surfactant-free MCT-oil/water system. Compared to the original Alopaeus breakage model or the combination of Alopaeus model and Prince coalescence model, this new model could greatly improve the prediction of droplet size distribution, Sauter mean diameter, median diameter and span of size distribution for both the dilute and the dense systems of dispersed oil phase.

However, due to the complexity of segregation and hopper discharge flows, accurately modeling this process has been challenging. In this study, we apply a continuum transport model to predict segregation of size bidisperse granular material during the discharge of quasi2D hoppers. We apply Discrete Element Method (DEM) simulations to reveal that segregation occurs mainly in a surface layer where particles are transported from the sidewalls to the hopper center. Velocity profiles are also developed based on a kinematic model and DEM data. The continuum model, which captures the interplay of advection, diffusion, and segregation, is then applied to predict the particle concentration distribution in the surface layer and the bulk. The continuum model accurately predicts the segregation pattern inside the hopper during discharge and the concentration profile of the discharged materials, in agreement with DEM simulations and experiments.

AB The present study reports a study of water droplets impacting on cold thin water films on a superhydrophilic surface. A thermal infrared imager was used to record the surface temperature distribution after the droplet impact on the liquid films. A ring-shaped high temperature zone was found after impact with the temperature first increasing and then gradually decreasing in the radial direction. Numerical simulations were then used to study the velocity distribution and the droplet motion inside the liquid film. The droplet spreading motion was restricted by liquid in the film for lower We which then reduces the heat transfer in that area and causes the formation of a ring-shaped high temperature distribution. The ring structure shape then changes with the increasing of We. This hot ring becomes wider and the temperature difference between the ring and the impact center decrease with the increasing of We. As We continues to increase, the ring-shaped temperature distribution disappears with the highest temperature at the center and the temperature in radial direction monotonically decreasing from the center to the edge. The initial film thickness also affects the temperature distribution after droplet impact. A thicker film causes the ring-shaped hot region to gradually move inward until it reaches the center and forms a hottest region in the impact center. Thus, the ring-shaped temperature distribution only occurs for lower We and thinner films. The shape and position of the temperature distribution after droplet impact on the cold, thin liquid films can then be precisely controlled by regulating the impact We and the initial film thickness. These results will greatly facilitate the design of precision spraying processes. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Fibrous silica beta zeolite (FSB) catalysts, which are excellent catalytic materials for petrochemical processes, were prepared by a microemulsion system assisted by commercial beta zeolite (BEA) seed crystallization under different urea/tetraethyl orthosilicate (urea/TEOS) ratios, denoted as 0.5:1-FSB, 1:1-FSB and 1:0.5-FSB. The physicochemical properties of the catalysts were investigated by XRD, MP-AES, FESEM, TEM, N2 physisorption and FTIR. The characterization results revealed that the dendrimeric silica fibers surrounding the BEA core shell of FSB were improved when the urea/TEOS ratio was altered, particularly for the ratio of 1:1. The highest terminal silanol and silanol nest intensities further confirmed its highest density of dendrimeric fibers. The catalytic testing of toluene methylation at 673 K resulted in the following order of p-, o- and m-xylene production ratio: 1:1-FSB (6/2/0) > 0.5:1-FSB (6/4/4) > 1:0.5-FSB (2/1/1). The catalyst with denser dendrimeric fibers led to lower acidity and pore volumes, which assist in selectively producing p-xylene and limiting the formation of side products. The FSB with denser dendrimeric fibers was also found to have a slower internal mass transfer rate, which is directly proportional to the activation energy. Optimization by the response surface methodology showed that the reactant molar ratio and reaction temperature were significant factors in the toluene methylation. The remarkable performance of these catalysts in the toluene co-reaction with methanol highlights their potential as future catalysts in the industrial application of toluene methylation and other chemical processes.

AB Typical electrospun polymer mats exhibit poor mechanical properties, undesirable for pressure-driven water filtration. Herein, strength enhancement of polyacrylonitrile-poly(vinyl chloride) (PAN-PVC) electrospun mats is demonstrated with a synergistic approach, using solvent vapor-induced welding of the polymer fibers at their cross points and reinforcement of the fibers by unfunctionalized multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs). Tensile strength and Young's modulus of the as-spun PAN-PVC mats are increased by 127% and 175% respectively via welding effects, and are further enhanced to 205% and 314% increments respectively, using 1 wt% MWCNTs. The post-treated composite mats achieve over four-fold the modulus predicted by the modified Halpin-Tsai model. With a slight total reduction in pure water flux (8%), water permeability is not greatly suppressed by welding the polymer fibers or by the presence of MWCNTs in the fibers. The two strength-enhancing strategies also allow recyclability of the post-treated composite mats with high particulate (25 nm-5 mu m) filtration efficiency of nearly 100% and good antifouling performance (flux recovery of >93%) throughout the 10 tested filtration cycles.

AB In this paper we quantify the effect of capillary number (Ca), contact angle (theta) and viscosity ratio (M) on the mobility of multiphase flow through porous media. The focus is mainly on oil-water flows through porous rocks observed during the water flooding process. Simulations are performed using a finite volume method employing a staggered grid formulation. Interactions between fluids and complex solid boundaries are resolved by a direct forcing, implicit and sharp interface immersed boundary method (IBM). The fluid-fluid interface is tracked by a mass conservative sharp interface volume of fluid (VOF) method. IBM and VOF are coupled by imposing the contact angle as a boundary condition at the three phase contact line. Our methodology has been verified/validated for several test cases including multiphase Poiseuille flow in a channel, a viscous finger in a channel and mesh convergence of the contact force. Two types of porous structures are considered: (i) a repeated single pore and (ii) a random multi-pore arrangement. Temporal evolution of phase pressure difference and oil saturation have been studied as viscous fingers penetrate the pores. We observed that the residual oil saturation for different capillary numbers shows exactly the opposite trend for the single and multi pore arrangement. The residual oil saturation for multi-pore shows a well defined linear trend with log Ca, theta and log M. (C) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB In real flotation systems, the flotation separation of fluorite from calcite is a challenge due to the similar surface properties of these two minerals. The purpose of this paper is to develop a highly selective flotation collector for the separation. Propyl gallate (PG) was introduced as a collector for selective flotation separation of fluorite from calcite. The separation of fluorite from calcite without using any depressant can be achieved by using PG as the collector. The flotation mechanism of fluorite and calcite was studied by zeta potential measurements, adsorption, FT-IR and XPS analysis. The results indicated that phenolic hydroxyls were the functional groups of PG which can selectively adsorb on fluorite, and the adsorption amount of PG on the surface of fluorite was larger than on calcite.

AB The interphase mass transfer in a falling film microchannel relies on the liquid-phase mass transfer behavior. Flow in a liquid film is predominantly laminar, and the liquid mass transfer is usually controlled by molecular diffusion. Micro-mixing structures were designed and configured in a double-side falling film microchannel, and the liquid side mass transfer was enhanced by fluid mixing and surface renewal. Computational fluid dynamics approach was used to simulate the falling film flow and mass transfer behavior with and without micro-mixing structures. The impact of the micro-mixing structures on the liquid side mass transfer coefficient was systematically investigated via CO2 absorption experiments in water. The results showed that the fluid flow and mixing was improved by staggered flow mode with micro-mixing structures in the falling film microchannels. Three flow patterns are observed inside the liquid film, including direct flow, cross flow, and vortex flow when the falling liquid film crosses the micro-mixing structures. Both cross flow and vortex flow intensify the surface renewal and turbulence of the liquid film, which is the fundamental reason for the enhancement of the liquid side mass transfer. The experimental results reveal that liquid side mass transfer coefficient in double falling film microchannels with micro-mixing structures is between 3.59 x 10(5) m/s and 5.38 x 10(5) m/s, while it is between 3.35 x 10(5) m/s and 4.82 x 10(5) m/s without micro-mixing structures. The liquid side mass transfer coefficient is increased 7-14% by the configuration of micro-mixing structures. Therefore, a double-side falling film microcontactor with micro-mixing structures not only reduces the contactor size, but also effectively enhances the interphase mass transfer behavior.

AB Non-ionic surfactants are widely used in many industrial applications such as detergents, oil recovery, and mineral flotation techniques. Non-ionic surfactants readily adsorb onto the oil-water interface, although they cannot dissociate in solutions like ionic surfactants can. Nonetheless, the electrostatic double-layer (EDL) repulsive force between oil drops coated with the non-ionic surfactant can still provide stability against coalescence. In this work, the interaction forces between two tetradecane drops with diameter of 6.5 mu m were measured in the presence of the non-ionic fluorocarbon-based surfactant FS-30 in various salt solutions using optical tweezers. The measured force curves were consistent with the presence of a surface charge, even though the surfactant was non-ionic in nature. The results clearly show that the EDL repulsive force is gradually screened with increasing salt concentration. It was also found that the EDL repulsive force was significantly screened in the divalent cation salt solutions (Ca2+, Ba2+) in comparison to in the monovalent cation salt solutions (Na+). In addition, the absolute value of the measured zeta potential (-xi) of emulsified tetradecane drops gradually decreased with increasing FS-30 concentration. In all experimental processes, the emulsified tetradecane drops coated with FS-30 were stable against coalescence. These findings have significant implications for the stability of emulsions used in the food, cosmetic, and detergent industries. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The penetration time of hydrophilic micron particles during the submergence process is experimentally studied by using a high-speed camera. The effects of impact velocity (0.5 m/s <= mu(p0) <= 1.48 m/s), surface tension (44.3 mN/m <= gamma <= 73.9 mN/m) and dynamic viscosity (1.31 mPa.s <= mu <= 2.13 mPa.s) on the penetration time have been investigated. The penetration time for different fluids can be expressed as two different functions with the increase of impact velocity, which are in a good accordance with the experimental results. The results show that the penetration time exhibits a power function with particle size at lower impact velocity (mu(p0) <= 0.5 m/s), which increases with the surface tension decreasing and dynamic viscosity increasing. As the impact velocity increases, the penetration time can be expressed as a linear function of particle size. When the impact velocity exceeds the transition velocity (mu(p0) approximate to 0.74 m/s), the penetration time decreases at first and then increases with the decreasing surface tension, while changing little with the increase of dynamic viscosity. The confinement effect of cavity induced by the Marangoni stress and viscous stress has been analyzed in the different surface tension and dynamic viscosity solutions, respectively. The competitive motion of the three-phase contact line (TPCL) width and interfacial deformation width is the key factor that controls the capillary force, further influencing the penetration time.

AB The present study focuses on the intensification of flow and mixing in coiled flow inverter (CFI) geometries in order to achieve higher mixing efficiency with a lower base footprint. For this, two designs of "compact coiled flow inverter (CCFI)", namely, symmetrical compact coiled flow inverter and asymmetrical compact coiled flow inverter, are proposed within the same floor area as covered by a standard design of a conventional CFI. The design of the symmetrical CCFI is based on incorporating as many as possible 90 degrees bends, whereas the asymmetrical CCFI is based on incorporating as much as possible mixing volume.
   In order to quantify the improvements caused by proposed designs, all three geometries (two CCFIs and one standard CFI) are compared (experimentally and numerically) with each other in terms of dimensionless dispersion number (D/UL) and mixing efficiency (that measures induced radial mixing by incorporating pressure drop penalty), over laminar flow regime (10 <= N-Re <= 145). After validation of the numerical model (CFD) with experimental data, the RTD at different cross-sectional planes along the length of coiled tube is investigated. Such a study provides the relative contribution of helical turns and 90 degrees bends in reducing axial dispersion, and also provides an insight of the required length of coiled tube that is sufficient to achieve a desired reduction in the axial dispersion. The present study reveals that the symmetrical compact coiled flow inverter has the highest mixing efficiency per unit occupied floor area, and requires the least length of coiled tube in order to reduce the axial dispersion at same extent. Thus, the symmetrical CCFI has potential to save significant material and operational energy cost in the Industry. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The dynamic behavior of compound droplets on the wall of a rectangle channel by the action of an imposed shear flow is simulated using our developed three-dimensional front-tracking method combined with generalized Navier boundary condition. The validity of the present method was confirmed by comparing results of the compound droplet spreading under gravity force with analytical solutions. To determine the physical condition required for detaching/pinching-off the compound droplet, we have performed a large number of simulations with varying capillary numbers of two interfaces and obtained a phase diagram of compound droplets on solid surface in shear flow. The deformation and motion of the compound droplet including its contact line motion are investigated. It is found that the behavior of the compound droplet is controlled by two dimensionless parameters, the capillary numbers of the outer interface and the inner interface. Moreover, we also analyze the deformation and migration of the inner droplet and discuss its effect on the compound droplet. The simulation demonstrate that the lateral migration of the small inner droplet could accelerates the pinch-off process and the large inner droplet could promote the detachment for a moderate capillary number of the outer interface.

AB Introducing a reduced particle stiffness in discrete element method (DEM) allows for bigger time steps and therefore fewer total iterations in a simulation. Although this approach works well for dry nonadhesive particles, it has been shown that for fine particles with adhesion, system behaviors are drastically sensitive to the particle stiffness. Besides, a simple and applicable principle to set the parameters in adhesive DEM is also lacking. To solve these two problems, we first propose a fast DEM based on scaling laws to reduce particle Young's modulus, surface energy and to modify rolling and sliding resistances simultaneously in the framework of Johnson-Kendall-Roberts (JKR)-based contact theory. A novel inversion method is then presented to help users to quickly determine the damping coefficient, particle stiffness and surface energy to reproduce a prescribed experimental result. After validating this inversion method, we apply the fast adhesive DEM to packing problems of microparticles. Measures of packing fraction, averaged coordination number and distributions of local packing fraction and contact number of each particle are in good agreement with results simulated using original value of particle properties. The new method should be helpful to accelerate DEM simulations for systems associated with aggregates or agglomerates. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Tight/shale reservoirs are extensively containing nanopores, and the confined space in nanopores can greatly alter the phase behavior of reservoir fluids due to the strong capillarity effect. Many researches have been recently conducted to investigate the effect of capillary pressure in nanopores on altering the oleic-vapor two-phase equilibria. Few attempts have been made to describe the effect of capillarity on the aqueous-oleic-vapor three-phase equilibria. This work proposes a new algorithm for performing three-phase pressure-temperature (P-T) flash coupled with capillary effect. This algorithm considers two capillary pressures that exist across the two interfaces dividing the three phases in a nanopore. When describing the three-phase equilibria, two types of reservoir wettability are considered: waterwet formation and oil-wet formation. In each case, distribution of the three phases in a nanopore is determined based on the spreading coefficient which refers to the spreading ability of an oleic phase over the spreading ability of an aqueous phase. Example calculations are conducted to show the robustness of the new algorithm as well as to study the effect of capillarity on the three-phase equilibria. Computation results show that the three-phase P-T envelope for a given hydrocarbons/water mixture in a nanopore can be significantly altered by capillary pressure, but how the envelope moves will depend on the wettability of the nanopore and the spreading coefficient. The general trend is that both the upper branch (i.e., the oleic-aqueous/vapor-oleic-aqueous boundary) and the lower branch (i.e., the liquid-vapor/ liquid-liquid-vapor boundary) of the three-phase envelope tend to move downward. Compared to the water-wet case, the oil-wet nanopore will shift the three-phase boundaries in a much larger degree. In addition to the alteration of the three-phase envelope, the presence of capillarity will also lead to the alteration of the phase fractions and phase compositions in the nanopore. Nanofluidic experiments should be conducted in the future to verify the findings obtained from the calculations. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Lycopene, a tetraterpenoid containing 13 double bonds, has important pharmaceutical and industrial application values. However, unstable supply of raw for extracted from natural host and residue of chemical reagents in chemically synthesized products have limited the quality of lycopene. Engineering microorganism is thus regarded as an alternative and attractive route for lycopene production. To improve the ability of engineered yeast to synthesize lycopene, here we have optimized the lycopene biosynthesis pathway and chassis metabolism. The results have verified that S. cerevisiae CEN.PK2-1C was more suitable for lycopene production because of its strong ability of synthesizing precursors of terpenoids. Compared to use inducible promoter, the use of constitutive promoter controlling pathway expression was more efficient for balancing lycopene synthesis and chassis metabolism. GGPP was identified the rate-controlling metabolite. Through expanding GGPP pool and MVA pathway, lycopene production was thus significantly increased. By citric acid fed-batch fermentation, the yield of lycopene finally reached 115.64 mg/L, 2689-folds of initial engineered yeast. These results indicated that cooptimization of heterologous pathway and chassis metabolism is a good strategy for enforcing microbial overproduction of natural products. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Fitting liquid-liquid equilibrium (LLE) data to common thermodynamic models (NRTL, UNIQUAC...) has been proved in the past to be a non trivial task. Many times it leads to inconsistent solutions where the Gibbs stability criteria is not satisfied. In this work, a simplified parameter estimation problem is formulated where the Gibbs stability criteria and the minimization of experimental and calculated phase composition distances, are simultaneously applied. This formulation is intended to be implemented in general mathematical computing software. Five isothermal ternary systems are studied and the obtained NRTL binary interaction parameters are compared with both existing published parameters and those obtained from commercial data regression tools. Results show that the combination of the proposed problem formulation with commercial non-linear programming solvers improves the quality of the ternary fittings obtained. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Compressible fluid dynamics is of great practical interest in many industrial applications, ranging from chemistry to aeronautical industry, and to nuclear field as well. At the same time, modelling and simulation of compressible flows is a very complex task, requiring the development of specific approaches, in order to describe the effect of pressure on the fluid velocity field. Compressibility effects become even more important in the study of two-phase flows, due to the presence of a gaseous phase. In addition, compressibility is also expected to have a significant impact on other physics, such as chemical or nuclear reactions occurring in the mixture. In this perspective, multiphysics represents a useful approach to address this complex problem, providing a way to catch all the different physics that come into play as well as the coupling between them.
   In this work, a multiphysics model is developed for the analysis of the generation IV Molten Salt Fast Reactor (MSFR), with a specific focus on the compressibility effects of the fluid that acts as fuel in the reactor. The fuel mixture compressibility is expected to have an important effect on the system dynamics, especially in very rapid super-prompt-critical transients. In addition, the presence of a helium bubbling system used for online fission product removal could modify the fuel mixture compressibility, further affecting the system transient behaviour. Therefore, the MSFR represents an application of concrete interest, inherent to the analysis of compressibility effects and to the development of suitable modelling approaches. An OpenFOAM solver is developed to handle the fuel compressibility, the presence of gas bubbles in the reactor as well as the coupling between the system neutronics and fluid dynamics. The outcomes of this analysis point out that the fuel compressibility plays a crucial role in the evolution of fast transients, introducing delays in the expansion feedbacks that strongly affect the system dynamics. Moreover, it is found that the gas bubbles significantly alter the fuel compressibility, yielding even larger differences compared to the incompressible approximation usually adopted in the current MSFR solvers.

AB Data driven soft sensors have found widespread applications in chemical processes for predicting those important yet difficult-to-measure quality variables. In the vast majority of chemical processes, relationships among primary and secondary variables are nonlinear, and process data inherently contain uncertainties and present strongly non-Gaussian characteristics. In addition, labeled samples are often scarce due to certain technical or economical difficulties. These process and data characteristics impose challenges on high-accuracy soft sensors. To deal with these issues, this paper proposes a soft sensing approach referred to as the semisupervised Dirichlet process mixture of Gaussians (SsDPMG). In the SsDPMG, a fully Bayesian model structure is first designed to enable semisupervised tasks that are suitable for regression applications. Subsequently, a Bayesian learning procedure for the SsDPMG is developed based on variational inference framework, where information contained in both labeled and unlabeled samples are extracted. Case studies are carried out on one numerical example and two real-life chemical processes to evaluate the performance of the proposed approach. The results demonstrate that the SsDPMG is an effective soft sensing approach with promising application foreground. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Differential pressure of gas-liquid mixture contains abundant information about fluid flow and its nature. In this paper, a differential pressure across a Venturi tube is measured for a gas-liquid mixture. Trend component and fluctuation components of the differential pressure are extracted using Extreme-Point Symmetric Mode Decomposition. The analysis shows that the mean of the trend component is related to liquid flowrate, and the amplitude of the fluctuation components is correlated to voidage and flow pattern. Hence, a fluctuation coefficient based approach to access voidage is proposed. This is based on the trend and fluctuation components. Since there exists an influence of gas/liquid flowrate, fluid density and voidage on fluctuation coefficient, their qualitative relationships are analyzed to find the appropriate variables to modify the fluctuation coefficient. Experimental data are used to determine the appropriate specific modification parameters. The modified fluctuation coefficient is found to be flow pattern dependent, and hence fuzzy pattern recognition is adopted to identify flow patterns combining statistics from differential pressure. Finally, a flow pattern-based correlation is proposed to estimate the voidage. Verifications through confrontation with experimental results show that the proposed correlation is effective in estimating voidage of mixtures. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The objective of the presented work is to verify a delayed detached eddy simulation (DDES) model for simulating transitional swirling flow in a micro-scale multi-inlet vortex reactor (MIVR). The DDES model is a k-omega based turbulence model with a low Reynolds number correction applied to the standard k-omega model such that the Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) component of the DDES model is able to account for low Reynolds number flow. By limiting the dissipation rate in the k-equation, the largeeddy simulation (LES) part of the DDES model behaves similarly to a one-equation sub-grid model. The turbulent Reynolds number is redefined to represent both modeled and resolved turbulence level so that underestimation of the RANS length scale in the LES range can be reduced. Applying the DDES model to simulate both laminar and transitional flow in the micro-scale MIVR produces an accurate prediction of mean velocity and turbulent intensity compared with experimental data. It is demonstrated that the proposed DDES model is capable of simulating transitional flow in the complex geometry of the micro-scale MIVR. These simulation results also help to understand the flow and mixing patterns in the micro-scale MIVR and provide guidances to optimize the reactor for the application of producing functional nanoparticles.

AB In this paper, reactive unsteady three-dimensional numerical simulations of a chemical looping combustion (CLC) unit are presented. The configuration is a 120-kW pilot plant working with perovskite, CaMn0.9Mg0.1O3-delta, as the selected oxygen carrier. Numerical simulations were performed using NEPTUNE_CFD code in the frame of an Euler-Euler approach by computing both gas and solid phases in an Eulerian technique, accounting for specific closures in order to model the interphase mass, and momentum and energy transfers. Heterogeneous reduction and oxidation (gas-solid) reactions were modeled by means of a grain model to account for the competing mechanisms of the chemical reaction onto the grain surface, the gaseous diffusion through the product layer around the grain, and the external transfer through the gas mixture surrounding the particle. Results from numerical simulations were assessed against experimental measurements and analyzed in order to acquire insight on the local behavior of reactive gas-particle flow in the CLC system. The theoretical/numerical tool developed in this work can be used for the design upgrade of crucial parts of the system in the stage of scaling-up from pilot to industrial plants.

AB In this work, design parameters of carrier-based dry powder inhalation were studied using surrogate modeling technique. The surrogate models constructed were then used to evaluate the key design parameters independently, which were otherwise difficult to determine based on experimental studies alone. Artificial neural network (ANN) was chosen as the surrogate modeling technique and models were constructed based on experimental data obtained from the literature. Twenty-eight variables describing the carrier size distribution, density, surface characteristics and operating conditions of dry powder inhaler were used as the input variables and emitted dose (ED) and fine particle fraction (FPF) were used as the output variables. Carrier surface characteristics were evaluated by applying image analysis on carrier SEM images. Genetic algorithm (GA) was used for the selection of important variables to be included in the surrogate models. Sensitivity analysis was also performed to determine the key variables affecting ED and FPF. Key design criteria for carrier-based dry powder inhalation were proposed based on the surrogate models constructed. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB The objective of this study was to optimize and to model the membrane fouling process. The modeling was based on two approaches, dynamical and phenomenological with the combination of surface phenomena. The established model was a transitional pore blockage model towards cake fouling through new characteristic parameters and a modified fouling index.
   The characteristic parameters developed in this study described the effect of cake restructuring, the shear, the mass of the cake, the filtered fluid recirculation according to the effective thickness Z(c) in the membrane fouling mechanism. The Modified fouling index - Dynamical surface phenomena (MFI- DSP) was developed by characteristics of multiple interactions forces ratio and mechanical forces in the transition of the regime.
   The membrane fouling was carried out according to the membrane compressibility factor m = 1, the cake n = [0-1] and the kinetics of the fouling process corresponding to the partial orders omega = [0-4]. The new model was validated based on experimental data in tangential and frontal filtration, using PES-10, UE-100 and NF-270 membranes with the prediction of the transitional blockage. Statistical analyzes at CI >= 95% showed better performance and efficiency of the new model compared to the existing models focused on the absolute relative error, the correlation coefficient, the number of characteristic parameters in the prediction, the characterization of the fouling process, as well as in the transition from pore blockage to cake filtration.

AB Immersed cohesive particles that aggregate under shear are commonly encountered in chemical engineering contexts. This work concerns the rheology of a particular set of systems, cement pastes, that have been difficult to treat from first-principles. In practice, these pastes exhibit large polydispersity with micron to millimeter sized particles, complicated particle shapes, and non-trivial surface morphology and surface chemistry. Simulations presented here utilize the discrete element model, informed by microscale atomic force microscopy measurements of surface topography, surface energy, and friction, and a simplified version of Stokesian Dynamics. Using these simulations, we study simple shear of two cementitious slurries composed of Portland cement and fly ash particles. These computations are then compared with steady-state vane rheometer experiments. This first-principles approach to comparing simulation and experiment allows us to explore how the microscale and macroscale physics are linked. Both computations and experiments agree qualitatively and are well modeled as Bingham plastics. Computations also show the emergence of percolating clusters, responsible for the rheology. Finally, including the mechanisms that are responsible for frustrated particle motions, such as effects of friction and rough walls at experimental scales, are shown to help give quantitatively better comparisons between simulation and experiment.

AB In this paper, the effects of dense vertical internals (rods) on gas holdup and local gas and liquid velocities were investigated by using the Eulerian-Eulerian model coupled with the population balance model. The inclusion of lift and wall lubrication forces was studied by applying different models. The results indicated that just by choosing the appropriate interfacial forces, the numerical model agrees well with the experimental data. A sharper gas holdup, a stronger gas velocity gradient, and a more intense liquid recirculation were observed as the important impacts of the internals. Moreover, three circular internals' arrangements were considered to study the effect of wall and core clearance distances on the bubble column hydrodynamics. The results revealed that by increasing the wall clearance distance, flatter gas holdup and velocity distributions could be achieved. Also, the turbulence parameters were used to evaluate the capability of the model in the prediction of the bubble size distribution. A modification factor for the breakage and coalescence kernels was proposed; the factor enabled the model to reach equilibrium mean diameters for bubbles. The comparison of the probability distribution function (PDF) of bubble sizes in the bubble column with and without internals showed a narrower bubble size distribution with a smaller mean diameter in the presence of internals.

AB There are two main mechanisms for amine emissions from absorption columns. The first is connected to the volatility of amine, determining the gaseous concentration. The second mechanism is via aerosol droplets containing amine. Recently, aerosol based emissions in g/Nm(3) were identified from typical PCCC plants (Khakharia et al., 2013). Mechanisms for aerosol formation, aerosol growth, emissions related to aerosol formation and in particular the development and testing of aerosol emission reducing systems for amine based post-combustion, are presently under study. However, there is still limited information available in the open literature.
   In some recent studies, the effect of water wash and demisting equipment was studied and results indicate that aerosol droplets still pass through these equipment sections. On the other hand, water wash systems help in increasing the droplet size as well as reducing both gas phase and aerosol based emission. However, this does not completely solve the problem (da Silva et al., 2013). Recently, modeling studies for mono-disperse droplet swarms are published (Majeed et al., 2017a, 2017b; Majeed and Svendsen, 2018a, 2018b). However, results for multi-sized droplet swarms and for droplet size distributions are missing.
   Droplets can be described by their size, temperature and composition. All droplet populations will have a size distribution, being just as important as any other parameter. Performing a distribution analysis is the best way to determine the sizes of droplets in a particular stream at any point in an absorber.
   In this work, both a multi-droplet size model and a size distribution model are implemented. The multi-droplet size model is used for validation and results are in line with findings from the mono-disperse model by (Majeed et al., 2017b; Majeed and Svendsen, 2018a). Droplet distribution model results are compared with experimental data from Toshiba (Fujita, 2017) and reasonable agreement is found. The development of inlet droplet distributions through an absorber and water-wash system is modelled for several flue gas sources. It is found that the outlet distribution mean size increases with inlet gas CO2 concentration. Similarly, the outlet mean droplet size decreases and the size distribution width increases with incoming droplet number concentration. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The application of terahertz pulsed imaging (TPI) in an in-line configuration to monitor the coating thickness distribution of pharmaceutical tablets has the potential to improve the performance and quality of the spray coating process. In this study, an in-line TPI method is used to measure coating thickness distributions on pre-coated tablets during mixing in a rotating pan, and compared with results obtained numerically using the discrete element method (DEM) combined with a ray-tracing technique. The hit rates (i.e. the number of successful coating thickness measurements per minute) obtained from both terahertz in-line experiments and the DEM/ray-tracing simulations are in good agreement, and both increase with the number of baffles in the mixing pan. We demonstrate that the coating thickness variability as determined from the ray-traced data and the terahertz in-line measurements represents mainly the intra-tablet variability due to relatively uniform mean coating thickness across tablets. The mean coating thickness of the ray-traced data from the numerical simulations agrees well with the mean coating thickness as determined by the off-line TPI measurements. The mean coating thickness of in-line TPI measurements is slightly higher than that of the off-line measurements. This discrepancy can be corrected based on the cap-to-band surface area ratio of the tablet and the cap-to-band sampling ratio obtained from ray-tracing simulations: the corrected mean coating thickness of the in-line TPI measurements shows a better agreement with that of the off-line measurements.

AB Pulse response experiments can provide a wealth of data for transient kinetic studies of gas phase heterogeneous reactions, with the ability to paint a detailed picture of intrinsic reaction kinetics pertaining to complex catalytic mechanisms. A novel framework called the Y-Procedure was developed by Yablonsky et al. to extract information from non-steady-state kinetic data (Yablonsky et al., 2007). The Y-Procedure reconstructs the chemical transformation rate and gas composition in the catalytic zone with no a priori assumptions on the kinetic model and is used to relate changes in catalytic reaction rates and kinetic parameters to changes in a catalyst's surface composition. This paper provides a detailed description of the data science work flow implemented in the Y-procedure through an experimental example of oxygen adsorption on platinum. This powerful method, along with a robust list of pre-processing methodology, will enable deeper understanding of kinetic processes and mechanism to be derived from the TAP pulse response technique.

AB Membranes of low thermal conductivity (thermal insulation) but high moisture permeability are highly desired in membrane-based humidification-dehumidification (MHDD) seawater desalination technology. The porous membranes with thermal insulation could decrease the heat losses in humidification, thus the system energy performance can be improved. To satisfy this purpose, in this study, a PVDF/SiO2 (Si aerogel) composite bilayer membrane of low heat conductivity is prepared and analyzed. To solve the problem of cracking in forming SiO2 layer, the casting solution (TEOS, H2O) is doped with a drying control chemical additive (DCCA) N, N-dimethylformamide (DMF) to decrease the surface tensions in the gel. Then performance analysis of the developed membranes are conducted and the membranes are characterized. The results found that the heat conductivity is decreased from 0.08199 W m (1) K (1) to 0.04487 W m (1) K (1), with a penalty of effective moisture diffusivity sacrificed from 4.93 x 10 (6) m(2)/S to 2.42 x 10 (6) m(2)/s. They are superior to the available SiO2 blend insulation membranes. Further, the membranes can be optimized by facile structural manipulations such as adjusting the SiO(2 )layer thickness to realize the desired performance while balancing the paradox between the permeability and heat conductivity. This is the first time that heat conductivity of membranes can be manipulated for seawater desalination. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The behaviour of spherical bubbles rising in water-ethanol and water-propanol mixtures was investigated experimentally for the whole range of concentrations, from pure water to pure alcohol. These two alcohols were chosen for their importance in industrial applications and for their peculiar properties resulting from the formation of organised microstructures in the non-ideal mixture at a molecular level. The effect of the composition of the alcohol-water mixtures on the physicochemical properties of the liquid was evaluated for all the solutions investigated, compared with literature values to critically access the effect of the concentration of alcohol on the bulk and interfacial properties of the mixtures. The hydrodynamic behaviour of bubbles rising in the mixtures was evaluated, by using high speed video to measure the bubble size and terminal velocity. From the corresponding drag coefficients, the mobility of the bubble's surface was determined revealing that in alcohol-water mixtures there are three regions: (1) with very low alcohol concentrations (X-E <= 0.01, X-P <= 0.005), the solutions behave as surfactant solutions with increase of bubble's drag coefficient with increase of the alcohol concentration till total immobilization of the bubble surface; (2) at intermedium concentration, the drag coefficient decreases as the concentration of alcohol increases with consequent increase of competition for location of alcohol molecules at the interface or on the bulk with formation of molecular network; (3) at high concentration (X-E >= 0.20 and X-P >= 0.07), the bubbles have again fully mobile surface as in a pure liquid.

AB Membrane-based hydrogen purification has been considered to be a promising alternative because of its low energy consumption, ease of operation, and cost effectiveness. Amino-functionalized ZIF-7 (ZIF-7-NH2) is an attractive candidate for membrane gas separation due to the maintenance of pore-opening structure after total removal of guest molecules (DMF). In this work, ZIF-7-NH2 membrane with improved both H-2 permeance and H-2/CO(2 )selectivity than reported mono-ligand ZIF-7 membrane was first prepared. Several activation process for ZIF-7-NH2 membranes to opening the pores were investigated. It was found that the coating of a Pebax (R) 1657 layer on the surface of ZIF-7-NH2 membrane is crucial for preventing the formation of cracks during pore-activation procedure. The permeance of H-2 and separation factor for H-2/CO2 binary mixtures were improved to similar to 1 x 10(7) mol/m(2)s Pa and similar to 19, respectively. The separation performance was very close to the upper bound for inorganic microporous membranes. Furthermore, the improved hydrothermal stability on ZIF-7-NH2 materials endows the membrane is highly potential for hydrogen purification. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Novel gas adsorption properties by room-temperature ionic liquids (ILs) confined in carbon nanotube (CNT) bundles were ascertained using grand canonical ensemble Monte Carlo (GCMC) simulations in which the adsorption and separation of CO(2 )from CO2/N-2 mixtures. The introduction of ILs into the CNT channels significantly enhances the adsorption of CO2, while it is not sensitive to N-2 adsorption. This is due to the strong interaction between specific ILs in the CNTs and CO2 molecules. The presence of water showed a significant impact on the adsorption capacity of CO2 as well.

AB Investigation was designed to clarify the difference in resistance for single-phase and two-phase flows in constricted capillaries, to define the effective pore throat, and at what pore size of a micro-channel the capillary resistance to gas-liquid interfaces starts taking effect. The experimental results indicate that the pressure drop profile for two-phase flows is significantly different from that for single-phase flows in constricted capillaries. For the same capillary, the resistance to a single-phase flow keeps constant after initial increase due to the fluid acceleration, but for two-phase flows, the resistance increases sharply when the two-phase interface enters the channel with a diameter smaller than a certain size. We defined this 'certain size' as the 'effective pore throat'. For a flow channel with a diameter larger than the effective pore throat, the capillary resistance to the interface is almost zero. When the flow channel has a size less than the effective pore throat, capillary force to two-phase interfaces takes effect, and the resistance to two-phase flows increases suddenly. The 'effective pore throat' is a critical point to determine whether the capillary resistance to the interface takes effect in a confined flow channel. It is between 150 and 650 mu m depending on capillary tip size and is very different from the geometrical throat of a channel. To predict pressure drops for a two-phase flow in constricted capillaries, a new equation is derived based on Darcy-Weisbach equation to calculate the frictional pressure drop in constricted capillaries. Young-Laplace equation is used to calculate the capillary pressure drop. The results show that after the interface enters the channel with a diameter less than the 'effective pore throat', the combination of our newly derived equation and Young-Laplace equation can predict the pressure drop with a deviation of +/- 20%. However, theories in literature cannot explain the sudden increase in the pressure drop and simulations cannot predict the effective pore throat. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In many chemical and biochemical processes, it is fundamental to accurately predict flow dynamics within reactors of different sizes and its influence on reactions and their kinetics. Computational Fluid Dynamics can provide detailed modeling about hydrodynamics. The objective of the present work is to assess the abilities of CFD to simulate free-surface turbulent flow within baffled stirred-tanks reactors. Transient simulations are carried out using a homogeneous Euler-Euler multiphase approach, the Volume-of-Fluid (VOF) method, with a Realizable k-epsilon turbulence model. Two methods are considered to account for the impeller motion, namely the Multiple Reference Frame (MRF) and Sliding Mesh (SM) approaches. Global and local results obtained by CFD are presented by means of statistical analysis, including the estimation of characteristic turbulent length scales. Instantaneous numerical data fields obtained with the SM model are then interpreted using modal decompositions methods, i.e. the Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) and the Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD) in order to extract their dominant spatial structures with their time behavior. All simulations are discussed based on comparison with experimental data. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB It has been known for a long time that the fluid flow and several global quantities, such as the power and pumping numbers, are about the same in baffled and unbaffled mechanically stirred vessels at low Reynolds numbers, but bifurcate at some intermediate Re and take drastically different values in fully turbulent flow. However, several details are not yet completely understood, notably concerning the relation of this bifurcation with the flow features and the transition to turbulence. In order to shed light on these issues, computational fluid dynamics was employed to predict the flow field in two vessels stirred by a six-bladed Rushton turbine at Reynolds numbers from 0.2 to 600 (covering the range from creeping flow to early turbulent flow). The two vessels differed only for the presence or absence of peripheral baffles. All simulations were conducted by a finite volume method in time-dependent mode, and a sliding-mesh technique was used in the baffled case to deal with the relative motion of baffles and impeller blades. A sensitivity analysis proved that a grid of about 5 million finite volumes was adequate to yield grid-independent results. The study proved that the bifurcation between quantities related to baffled and unbaffled tanks occurs when the inner (near-impeller) and outer (near-wall/baffles) flow fields interact significantly. It also elucidated the mechanisms of transition to turbulence in baffled and unbaffled tanks, notably showing in this latter case the existence (in the rotating reference frame of the impeller) of a periodic flow regime which involves a travelling wave instability.

AB This paper introduces Lagrangian Mixing Simulation (LMS), which is a new method that uses particles to track the flow front between two fluids in a mixer. The line formed by an ensemble of particles enables the calculation of the instantaneous rate of interfacial area generation between the fluids and the computation of segregation scales. LMS uses the Eulerian velocity field from CFD simulation, which has a spatial resolution determined from the flow dynamics, for the simulation of mixing at scales that are several orders of magnitude below the CFD gridscale. Since only the interface between the two fluids is simulated, the LMS is orders of magnitude faster than the flow field simulation. In this work, LMS is applied to 2D CFD simulations of the flow in Confined Impinging Jets (CIJ) reactors for Re = 100, 300 and 500. LMS shows that the interfacial area generation is exponential for chaotic flow regimes (Re = 300 and 500) and linear for steady flows (Re = 100). Moreover, LMS is able to simulate segregation scales smaller than 10( 8 )m, i.e., LMS result spans and overcomes the entire range of spatial scales that have physical meaning. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB An efficient method for capturing ammonia from wastewater will effectively solve the ammonia nitrogen pollution in hydrosphere, and the captured ammonia can be utilized potentially as carbon-free energy carriers instead of hydrogen. While the ammonia removal from wastewater has been previously demonstrated, many challenges remain, including indirect ammonia removal, chemicals consumption and secondary pollution. Here, we propose a chemical-free method for ammonia capture by a hybrid system consisting of bipolar membrane electrodialysis (BMED) and hollow fiber membrane contactor (HFMC). It is achieved by taking advantage of the water splitting in BMED as a sustainable "chemical supplier" for hollow fiber extraction. Results indicate that a normalized current density of similar to 0.29 mA cm(2) (mg/min)(-1 )should be applied to BMED unit; the minimum energy consumption is 63.59 kJ/(mol NH4+-N) for treating the wastewater with NH4+-N concentration of 200 mg/L; and the ammonia capture ratio can be reached at 65.2%, which can be increased further to >98% through increasing the stages of HFMC modules.

AB Rhodococcus ruber harboring intracellular nitrile hydratase (NHase) is widely used in large-scale acrylamide production. Transcriptome analyses of R. ruber under urea induction and heat shock revealed the novel chaperones GroEL2 and GroES. M. jannaschii chaperone rTHS, functional in organic solvent as reported in literature, was selected as control. In vitro experiments (70 degrees C/90 degrees C incubation) showed that GroEL2 from R. ruber was highly thermostable and can stabilize other proteins as well. GroEL2 was co-expressed with NHase in E. coli in three ways: (a) monocistronic expression with one T7 promoter, (b) bicistronic expression with double T7 promoters, and (c) fusion expression with one T7 promoter driving the NHase-GroEL2 chimera. Experimental results showed that the NHase-GroEL2 chimera was the most successful expression strategy. Maximal NHase activity was enhanced by 63.6% compared with the single NHase control. A stability assessment showed that the residual activity levels after heat shock and acrylamide (AM) immersion increased by 2.9x and 1.1 x, respectively. For the fusion chimeras NHase-GroES and NHase-rTHS, their thermal stability also significantly enhanced by 1.6x and 64.0%, respectively; but their AM resistance both reduced (36.2% and 29.0%, respectively). In vivo heat inactivation curves further confirmed thermal stability enhancement of NHase by chaperone fusion, in which NHase-GroEL2 was the most stable one. Its inactivation constant k(d) was only similar to 1/4 that of the single NHase. The K(cat )of the intracellular NHase-GroEL2 was also remarkably higher than that of the NHase control.

AB The hindered-settling velocity function for the modelling, simulation and control of secondary settling tanks can be determined from batch tests. The conventional method is to measure the velocity of the descending sludge-supernatant interface (sludge blanket) as the change in height over time in a vessel with constant cross-sectional area. Each such experiment provides one point on the flux curve since, under idealizing assumptions (monodisperse suspension, no wall-effects), the concentration of sludge remains constant just below the sludge blanket until some wave from the bottom reaches it. A newly developed method of estimation, based on the theory of nonlinear hyperbolic partial differential equations, is applied to both synthetic and experimental data. The method demonstrates that a substantial portion of the flux function may be estimated from a single batch test in a conical vessel. The new method takes into consideration that during an ideal settling experiment in a cone, the concentration just below the sludge blanket increases with time since the mass of suspended solids occupy a reduced volume over time.

AB Silver particles, prepared in a T-mixer under different flow rates, were selected to study the influences of mixing on particle shape evolution. Mixing effects on particle growth were visualized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and analysed quantitatively by sedimentation coefficient distributions derived from analytical centrifugation (AC). The mixing time under different flow rates was determined by the Villermaux-Dushman method to quantify the mixing quality. Based on the finding of a mixing-induced shape transformation from plates to dendrites, an extended growth mechanism involving mixing effects was proposed. Slow mixing leads to a non-uniform distributed reactant mixture and low effective supersaturation. This causes preferential growth of high-energy facets resulting in plate-like particles with broad, multimodal sedimentation distributions. In contrast, fast mixing, corresponding to uniform reactant mixture and thus high effective supersaturation and nucleation rate, leads to dendritic products, and narrow but bimodal sedimentation distributions.

AB A numerical study on the electrokinetic motion of a charged oil droplet near a charged air-water interface is presented in this paper. First, the separation distance between the oil droplet and the air-water interface is calculated, and then the electrokinetic velocity of the droplet is simulated utilizing a three-dimensional numerical model under different applied electric fields, droplet's radii, ionic concentrations, zeta potentials of the oil-water interface, and zeta potentials of the air-water interface. The numerical results indicate that a negatively charged oil droplet near a negatively charged air-water interface moves in opposite direction of the direct current electric field and has larger velocity under higher electric field strength, droplet's radius, ionic concentration, and absolute values of the two interface zeta potentials.

AB One of the techniques for the removal of Cu2+ from water and wastewaters is adsorption and special attention has been focused on biosorption. Compared to the conventional method, adsorption today is the most suitable method for removing pollutants from wastewater. The adsorption of Cu2+ on natural materials such as zeolites and clays is considered, and modified natural materials are also in use because they possess the ion-exchange ability. For industrial applications, the use of biopolymers and hydrogels is proposed because they can reduce the initial concentrations of metal ions to the billions of original concentrations, and are widely available and environmentally safe. The modified biopolymer adsorbents on the basis of polysaccharides (derived from chitin, chitosan, and starch) have been proposed as new materials for the removal of Cu2+ ions from wastewater. Nanoparticles based on carbon nanotubes CNTs, as well as new nano-adsorbents based on graphene and its composites, show a very high efficiency of removal of Cu2+ from wastewater. The adsorption process on natural adsorbents (biosorption) is a relatively recent process that has found a great application in the removal of heavy metals, phenols, paints and other organic pollutants from wastewater. Adsorption on biosorption has become a potential alternative to existing technologies for the effective removal of low concentrations of Cu2+ and other metals from aqueous solutions and wastewaters because of the simplicity, cost-effectiveness and high capacity of removing both organic and inorganic water pollutants. The results of bibliographic searches show that many agricultural by-products, as well as waste materials from the food and wood industry, which have low or almost no economic value, can be used as adsorbents for the adsorption of Cu2+ ions from the solution.

AB An Euler-Euler two-fluid approach was used to simulate the behavior of gas bubbles rising in a stagnant liquid metal. A single point injection with four gas flow rates resulted in the formation of bubble chains undergoing either slight or distinct oscillations of the bubble trajectories. A set of interfacial closures with a shear stress transport (SST) k-omega turbulence models was applied for simulating the transient behavior of the bubble chain. X-ray radiography measurements were conducted to establish an experimental data base for validating the numerical results. The experiments provide a visualization of the bubble chain in a flat container and allow determining the bubble size and integral void fraction. Two bubble induced turbulence (BIT) models (Rzehak and Krepper, 2013a, Sato et al., 1981) and a modified turbulent viscosity approach (Johansen et al., 2004) were applied within this study. For all gas flow rates, the Rzehak and Sato BIT model alone predicted a steady bubble chain in contrast to the oscillating bubble plume observed in the experiments. Without a BIT model the oscillating bubble chain can be predicted but the oscillation frequency is underestimated especially for high gas flow rates. In addition, calculations without a BIT model predicted over-dispersion of the averaged gas fraction through the whole fluid container for the high gas flow rates. The best results in terms of a satisfying agreement with the experimental data were achieved by adopting a modified turbulent viscosity approach proposed by Johansen together with the Rzehak and Krepper BIT model. These findings demonstrate the significance of the turbulence model. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In the present work we propose an efficient and general algorithm for optimization under uncertainty based on the work of Srinivasan et al. (2003). We use specialized cubature rules to speed up the uncertainty propagation step which results in a significant reduction of the overall computational effort. The approach is illustrated by studying the optimal design of a fixed bed reactor for the synthesis of maleic anhydride from raffinate II feedstock, where the amount of n-butane and n-butenes in the feed is assumed to be uncertain. Applying the algorithm results in a robustified reactor design which shows significantly less temperature constraint violations and runaway conditions while still satisfying reactor performance criteria such as minimally required conversion and maximum allowable pressure drop.

AB The radial particle concentration distribution in riser is comparatively low in the central area and increases sharply near the wall. It is the so-called typical core-annulus structure. The occurrence of the core-annulus was usually contributed to the velocity gradient in the boundary layer or the drag force. In this paper, an aerodynamic theory is used in the two-phase flow analysis. A transverse force on the particles, the Kutta-Joukowski force, is introduced to explain and quantify the formation of the core-annulus in riser. This force is the function of the particle velocity curl, the slip velocity and the gas density. Based on the experimental results combining with the data proposed in the published literatures, the distribution of the Kutta-Joukowski transverse force in riser is discussed. The results show that this force is the main factor of the core-annulus occurrence. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB The goal of this research was to develop a model for a UV photodecomposition reactor (PhoR), which is used for the removal of trace siloxane impurities from biogas. The model properly accounts for the phenomena taking place inside the reactor, including fluid flow, mass and heat transfer, the transmission of UV radiation, and the photodecomposition reaction. Lab-scale experimental data were used to experimentally validate the model, and to also provide a "proof-of-concept" of the proposed PhoR technology prior to its field-testing at a real landfill site. The model was then utilized in the design of the experimental system used in the field-testing component of this study. Two reactor configurations were modeled: In the first configuration (termed PhoRl), the UV lamps are not in direct contact with the biogas, whereas in the second one (PhoRII), the lamps are placed in direct contact with the biogas stream. The PhoRII configuration is substantially more efficient for siloxane degradation, but concerns exist about the long-term robustness of the UV lamps in such an environment. The same model also presently finds use for further process design and scale-up, and in the preliminary technical and economic analysis (TEA) of the PhoR technology. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Gas hydrates are regarded as promising materials for various potential applications. In particular, CO2 hydrates are known for their cold storage capacities, related to their high latent heat of melting. They could be used as high efficiency Phase Change Materials in Phase Change Slurries for secondary refrigeration loops.
   A better understanding of the crystallization mechanism of CO2 hydrates in slurries and of the resulting formation kinetics is still needed to evaluate and improve the efficiency of hydrate-based secondary refrigeration process. For that purpose, in the present work the real-time evolution of CO2 concentration in the liquid phase was measured in situ during hydrate formation. CO2 hydrates were formed within a stirred reactor equipped with an Attenuated Total Reflection probe coupled with a Fourier Transform Infra-Red spectroscopy analyzer.
   By comparing the measured concentration to calculations based on the assumptions of (a) a liquid-vapor equilibrium (LVE) and (b) a hydrate-liquid equilibrium (HLE), it was deduced that the crystallization kinetic is limited by CO2 transfers from the vapor phase to the liquid phase, whatever the experimental conditions tested. As soon as hydrates start forming, the CO2 concentration in the liquid phase almost instantaneously reaches the hydrate-vapor equilibrium (HVE) value at the experimental temperature, while the reactor pressure slowly decreases towards the LVE value defined by Henry's law. Different stirring speeds were experimented in order to check the effect of enhancing CO2 dissolution during hydrate formation. This resulted in faster dissolution of CO2, though still transfer-limited formation kinetics. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB A continuum-scale numerical model is developed to simulate the flow, mass-transfer, and reactive processes taking place during the injection of zero-valent iron nanoparticles (nZVI) in a water-saturated porous medium, containing a chlorinated non-aqueous phase liquid (NAPL) at its residual saturation (source zone). Firstly, the transport of the nanoparticles (NP) is modelled by coupling the nanoparticles transport with their deposition in a porous medium. A systematic sensitivity analysis is done to examine the individual effect of each parameter on the spatial and temporal evolution of nanoparticle concentration along the column length. The parameters quantifying the kinetics of attachment/detachment between the nanoparticles and the porous medium (sand grains) are estimated via inverse modeling. Secondly, the kinetics of the reaction of nZVI with dissolved tetrachloroethylene (PCE) is based on the numerical predictions of the statistical shrinking-core model that couples the mass-transfer with the reactive processes taking place at a nanoparticle scale. The continuum NP transport model is then extended to include the reactive flows by combining the dynamics of PCE ganglia dissolution and nZVI reactions with mass balances for the residual PCE saturation, the dissolved PCE concentration, and the nZVI concentration in the aqueous phase. Sensitivity analyses are performed on the NP transport-NAPL remediation model with a view to clarify the effects of dimensionless parameters (dimensionless flow velocity, Damkohler numbers) on the fate of nZVI and trapped PCE ganglia. Finally, the residual PCE remediation efficiency is numerically predicted as a function of the injected NP mass. This efficiency is compared with the respective experimental results of a PCE source zone remediation test performed in a sand column, by using as adjustable parameters the kinetic coefficients of the nanoparticles deposition on sand grains. The remediation efficiency of the PCE source zone is maximized when the injected nZVI maintains its reactivity throughout its flow in the porous medium. To design an efficient NAPL source zone remediation strategy, the parameters must be set to values which will ensure that the nZVI is kept to a higher than zero concentration throughout the length of the porous medium.

AB In the work, we demonstrated the possibility of directly using the existing KMnO4 as Mn precursor and graphite as the carbon precursor in Hummers method to decorate MnO2 nanomaterials over graphene oxide (GO). Nanorod-like alpha-MnO2 in the form of single crystal were found closely decorated over GO. The MnO2 content could be easily adjusted from 45% to 18% by decrease the amount of KMnO4 from 15.0 g to 7.5 g. Compared with the reported work, the developed simplified Hummers method in this work could better utilize KMnO4 by cutting exceed 50% of KMnO4 amount, cut the reagents especially some hazardous reagents from 6-8 items to 3 items, cut 1/3 of the preparation time, avoid high temperature reaction. All those advantages make the simplified Hummers method green, low cost, eco-friendly, time and energy saving, which are beneficial to the industrialization of the MnO2/GO composite. The MnO2/GO composite showed good performance in the degradation of methylene blue with the assistance of H2O2. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Dynamic performance of a milli-scale fixed bed reactor for Fischer-Tropsch synthesis (FTS) was studied using a dynamic pseudo-homogeneous 1D reactor model. The model uses detailed kinetics to describe the rates of FTS product formation. Dynamic responses of the process variables and main performance indicators, including productivity of C-5(+) hydrocarbons and CH4 selectivity, to input step changes, were analyzed. Total of 7 inlet variables were used in step-change-response analysis, with different magnitudes of change and for two initial steady-state conditions. Reactor simulations show highly nonlinear behavior due to phenomena coupling and fast dynamics due to system small scale and intensified rates within. In addition, reactor model shows instability related to thermal runaway with certain magnitudes of step change of coolant temperature and feed flow rate. The analysis outlines the effects of potential process disturbances on operation of milli-scale fixed bed reactor for FTS and provides general guidelines for control systems. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

ID DISCRETE ELEMENT METHOD; COLLISIONS; DEM
AB Traditional computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations with resolved objects progressing through the fluid using a moving and deforming mesh require a fixed mesh topology. Though such simulations may more readily capture conditions where large gradients in the flow field exist, particularly high speed, compressible flow phenomena, the ability to directly model the conduction portion of the contact between particles or between particles and other solid bodies immersed in the fluid is thus restricted. A new method was devised to allow for the maintenance of the mesh topology while simulating the contact heat conduction between a discretized particle pair and between a discretized particle and a wall for the intended purpose of implementation of the technique within a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) based coupled particle-fluid flow model. The method is tested for a range of contact resistances (0-1 x 10(3) M-2 K/W) and material thermal conductivity (1.60-162 W/m K) and specific heat (50.28-5028 J/kg-K) combinations with one object initially at 700 K and the other at 300 K. The temperature distributions across the mid-particle or mid-particle and wall line produced by the new method at a given time are compared to the results for a standard finite volume simulation of contacting bodies. The maximum difference in the local temperatures obtained is under 1%. Hence, the technique is a robust means of simulating the resolved heat conduction contact thermal energy exchange without connected computational elements, retaining the needed fluid gap space around the solid bodies. Future work will build upon this technique to include the convective and radiative modes of heat transfer before simulating moving and interacting particles in a fluid flow.

AB The study of the permeation of oil droplets through a network of pore bodies and pore throats is complicated because of the need to track both the advancing and the receding interfaces and the possible branching of the oil ganglion. For the sake of simplicity and to gain understanding of the features associated with the motion of a droplet in a network, in this work, we eliminate the possibility of branching. In other words, we consider the case in which the oil droplet moves through a cascade of pore bodies and pore throats. In this case only two interfaces need to be tracked; namely the receding and the advancing interfaces. While it was possible to derive analytical expressions to determine the critical entry pressures when the oil droplet is still at the surface of the cascade, it remains challenging to find such analytical expressions when the oil droplet completely enters it. In this case both the advancing and the receding interfaces play a role. When the oil droplet completely enters the cascade, it becomes an oil ganglion, the movement of which is determined by the entry pressure. The entry pressure depends on the curvatures of both the leading and receding interfaces. This implies that the entry pressure is changing along the cascade. The largest values of the entry pressure, however, are those obtained when the leading interface is in a pore throat and the receding interface is in a pore body. In this work, we estimate the entry pressure in two situations; namely, when the leading interface is at the entrance of a pore throat and, likewise, when it is at the end. One can then infer how the entry pressure changes along the pore throat length. To determine the curvature of the receding interface, we use the fact that, for incompressible fluids (which is our case), the volume of the oil ganglion is conserved and that the interfaces assume the static contact angle at the contact with the wall. A nonlinear algebraic equation is developed, the solution of which provides the radius of curvature of the receding interface. Interesting results are obtained including the entry pressure values at different locations, the distribution of the oil ganglion along the cascade, and the radius of curvatures of the leading and the receding interfaces.

AB The mechanical properties and mechanical stabilities of pipewall hydrate deposition are of great importance to the prevention and removal of pipeline hydrate plugging. In this paper, the mechanical properties and mechanical stabilities of pipewall hydrate deposition are quantitatively investigated by modelling and numerical simulation. First, a structural model for pipewall hydrate deposition is established based on particle packing theory. Using this structural model, the main mechanical parameters of pipewall hydrate deposition can be calculated. Then, numerical simulations using finite element method and ANSYS Mechanical APDL 14.5 are conducted based on the calculated mechanical parameters. Through the simulations, the structure deformation, internal stress distribution and failure of pipewall hydrate deposition when it is under the action of external forces are studied and the influences of flow rate, deposition thickness and deposition length are investigated. The results of this paper can provide guidance for pipeline flow assurance. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Polyethylene (PE) foams, which constitute a large share of the total production of thermoplastic foams worldwide, are mainly derived from low density PE (LDPE). In this study, linear low-density PE (LLDPE), with its good mechanical properties but inferior foamability, was blended with LDPE by twin-screw compounding at varying mass ratios of 0/100, 5/95, 15/85, 25/75, and 100/0. Differential scanning calorimetry and small amplitude oscillation shear tests confirmed the compatibility of the blends. A high-pressure rheometer was used to measure the rheological properties of the blends under different CO2 pressures with the aid of a homemade fixture. Gotsis' model was applied to correlate the rheological data for the blends and obtain their characteristic relaxation time and rigid modulus, which were then substituted into the bubble growth and stability model for numerical simulation. Referring to Considere criterion, it was found that the LLDPE/LDPE blends with a mass ratio of 5/95 possessed the best foamability, and the characteristic relaxation time had a significant effect on the foamability. Batch melt foaming experiments also confirmed the simulation results. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The production of oil-degrading bacteria in multiphase airlift reactors (ALBs) could be limited by the mass transport of both the gaseous and oil phases. In our study, the mass transfer rates of hexadecane and oxygen (HTR/OTR) were evaluated during the production of oil-degrading bacteria in a 3-L airlift reactor. To improve the HTR/OTR ratios during kinetics, a high initial concentration of hexadecane (77 g L (1)) and constant superficial gas velocity (U-G) in the range of 1.5-3.5 cm s (1) were used. Under these conditions, all initial HTR/OTR were close to the stoichiometric consumption ratio (SCR, similar to 0.28), which in turn decreased at the end of the culture until 0.173 +/- 0.013, 0.108 +/- 0.006 and 0.123 +/- 0.006 (g HXD) (g O-2) (1) for U-G of 1.5, 2.5, 3.5 cm s (1), respectively. The evaluation of the Damkohler numbers suggested an enhancement of HXD mass transport that allowed for obtaining a maximum suspended solids (SS) production of 4.9-6.0 g SS (L h) (1). Since the operation of the ALB at high superficial gas velocities may lead to high power inputs, the variable UG technique was used for energy saving, finding similar maximum SS production (6.09 g SS (L h) (1)) to that obtained at a constant U-G of 2.5 cm s (1) and an energy saving of 33.4%. The improvement in the HTR/OTR ratio during ALB performance allowed us to enhance the production of an oil-degrading microbial consortium. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The conversion of bio-char to CaC2 is a potential way to achieve the production of high-value-added chemicals from biomass. The unique properties of bio-char, such as its fine particles, high activity, and low ash content, provide a high reaction rate, low reaction temperature, and high CaC2 purity, which increase the feasibility of converting bio-char to CaC2. This work investigates the morphological behaviors of the solid reactants and the products, as well as the reaction kinetics, in terms of changes in activation energy and the particle size of the reactants. The experiments were carried out using a thermal gravimetric analyzer coupled with a mass spectrometer (TG-MS) at temperatures lower than 1700 degrees C using corncob char and CaO as the starting materials. The TG-MS data and kinetics modeling show that at temperatures of 1400-1700 degrees C, the reaction of corncob char and CaO with a particle size of 22-114 mu m is predominantly under reaction control, but is slightly affected by the size of the reactants. During the course of the reaction, the reacting solids agglomerate via the formation of CaC2 without apparent melting. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Oil-in-water emulsions is frequently encountered in the industry of oil exploitation. The complex dynamic behavior of oil droplets brings about a great challenge in understanding its underlying flow regime. In the present study, we attempt to characterize flow instability of oil-in-water emulsions through measuring the information transfer between oil droplets. An experiment of vertical upward oil-in-water emulsions is conducted in a flow loop facility with 20 mm pipe inner diameter (ID), and multivariate time series are acquired by sampling the signals of a distributed sixteen-channel conductance mono-sensor probe array. The collected multivariate time series are firstly processed with an algorithm designated as transfer entropy (TE), through which the interaction between oil droplets at pipe cross section are investigated. Moreover, with the aid of multivariate weighted multiscale permutation entropy (MWMPE) algorithm, we also explore the global flow instability of oil droplets. Research results indicate that with the increasing distance from pipe center, the interaction between oil droplets gradually weakens. Besides, the increase in mixture velocity or the decrease in water-cut will intensify the interaction between oil droplets and global flow instability. Multivariate time series analysis can be considered as an effective method for characterizing flow instability in oil-in-water emulsions. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB A ceramic oxygen pump has been investigated as a potential self-heated oxygen generation device using electric potential as driving force. The required high temperature (around 748 degrees C) can be maintained locally on the membrane while the environmental temperature is kept at lower than 200 degrees C. The conventional dense membrane structure was found to be inappropriate for this application because it could not withstand the thermal shock induced by rapid heating and cooling. In contrast, the microchanneled membrane used in this work demonstrated excellent thermal shock resistance. It also demonstrated high Faraday efficiency when no electrode was coated on the microchannel surface. The Faraday efficiency exceeded 90% at 748 degrees C when 6.35 A cm(-2) current density was applied. Under these conditions, an oxygen flux density of 20.6 ml cm(-2) min(-1) was achieved and this continued for 100 h without any degradation. Combined, these factors demonstrate that the microchanneled membrane can be potentially utilized within an oxygen generator having small size and good durability.

AB The hydrodynamics and retention of 2D countercurrent chromatographic systems were investigated for the first time for ionic liquid based biphasic solvents using high-speed imaging. The results were compared against 3D chromatographic systems and different solvent systems for a wide range of beta values (0.27-0.83). The studies revealed details of the phase distribution, the mixing and settling areas within the column, as well as the interfacial characteristics that can enhance mass transfer (such as waves). There was no single-phase flooding in the beta range 0.27-0.5 contrary to previous limited visualisation studies, which suggested that for the biphasic solvents they utilized, single-phase flooding at low beta values (less than 0.5) occurs. Previously unseen, stable, six segment phase distributions, involving alternate high and low stationary phase retention were observed for the ionic liquid biphasic solvent system but not for the organic-aqueous and aqueous-aqueous biphasic solvent systems also studied. This unusual behaviour and the resulting considerable variations in interfacial height and thus local velocity of each phase along the coil, are discussed in the text. The ionic liquid biphasic solvent also demonstrated novel behaviour in other aspects. In the mixing zone around the proximal key node, interfacial waves were observed; however, it was found that their amplitude and frequency depended on the chosen elution mode as well as the mobile phase flow rate and beta value. While there was some agreement in the performance of both column geometries, it was found that for the serial 2D column there was always some retention of the stationary phase over the entire range of flow rates tested, unlike the case for the 3D column.

AB The objective of this work is to develop a high-fidelity transport model for pulsed reactor scenarios involving Knudsen and beyond-Knudsen (viscid flow) conditions. This is done to eventually support accurate analyses of flow regimes and micro-kinetic processes under dynamic conditions. The resulting model renders mass transport under mixed modes of diffusion, advection and eddy (turbulent) diffusion, allowing for variance of input conditions (pulse magnitudes, temperature, etc.), gaseous mixtures and various reactor designs. The model assumes a five-zone reactor, covering inlet, pre-catalyst, catalyst, postcatalyst and outlet zones. A chief attribute of the modeling approach herein is the detailed analysis it provides for quantification of multiple transport metrics over reactor space and time, a transport "map". Key among these are the Knudsen number and the relative contribution of advection versus diffusion as the pulse intensity is increased. The ability to map the reactor transport is useful for determining an optimal loading configuration to observe desired kinetic quantities associated with different chemical reaction mechanisms.

TI Theoretical analysis of the explosion limits of hydrogen-oxygen mixtures

SO CHEMICAL ENGINEERING SCIENCE
LA English
DT Article
DE Explosion limits; Ignition temperature; Thermodynamic stability;
   Hydrogen ignition
AB We present here a novel explanation for the explosion limits phenomenon, based on the concept of thermodynamic stability analysis of the fuel-oxidizer mixture. This concept is demonstrated by a detailed statistical thermodynamic analysis of the explosion limits of the H-2-O-2 system. It is shown that while the magnitude of the relative fluctuations in the number of molecules is very small, the reactants approach their thermodynamic stability limit at the explosion limit, thus contributing to the onset of self-ignition. It is also found out that the products (H2O) behave in an opposite manner, being on the verge of stability in the non-explosive region, and becoming stable above the explosion limit. The different chain-carriers are on the verge of thermodynamic stability over the complete range (both explosive and non-explosive regions), a fact that sits well with their short residence time as known from chemical kinetics and experiments. We conclude that the unique nature of the branching limits phenomenon can be considered as a thermodynamic stability problem, promoting the idea that a universal self-ignition criterion can be developed.

AB Understanding the particle dynamics is of paramount importance to the design, operation and optimization of looping combustion reactors. In this paper, a three-dimensional Eulerian-Lagrangian model was developed to study the particle flow in a dual circulating fluidized bed consisting of an air reactor and a fuel reactor. Based on the Multi-Phase Particle-In-Cell (MP-PIC) scheme, the turbulent gas motion was simulated by the large eddy simulation (LES) and the particle flow simulated by the discrete particle method, with the particle size distribution (d(p) = 0-108 mu m) being fully taken into account. The effects of particle size, particle density, initial bed inventory and fluidizing gas flow rate were numerically studied. The results show that small particles mainly distribute in the fuel reactor while large particles tended to stay in the air reactor, leading to an unfavorable influence on the efficiency of metal oxide. The increase of particle density led to the increase of global and internal circulation rates. A high initial bed inventory would result in a high particle concentration and lower axial velocities of particles. When increasing the fluidizing gas flow rate in the fuel reactor, the internal particle circulation rate increased gradually; however, the global particle circulation rate decreased. The results should be useful for the design and control of dual circulating fluidized bed, looping combustion reactors. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In the fibrous filtration of particles in gas and liquid flows, loading is the act of particles depositing onto fibers. Loaded particles alter the filter microstructure and can have a profound influence on the pressure drop across a filter medium. Of interest is therefore a simple approach to predict the pressure drop across a loaded filter, accounting for both fibers and loaded, spherical particles. In the present study, we use computational fluid dynamics simulations to develop a simple predictive model for the pressure drop across fibrous media composed of a combination of cylindrical fibers and spherical particles. Specifically, the pressure drop is calculated via an in-house written code to solve the incompressible viscous flow equations in a periodic domain, with the particles and fibers accounted for via the immersed boundary method. For calculations, we generate randomly oriented three-dimensional virtual fibrous networks with prescribed microstructures, including network total solidity, fiber orientation angle distribution, fiber radius distribution, and particle radius distribution (both polydisperse). We find that irrespective of network geometry, by defining a single effective network diameter, the product of the dimensionless pressure drop per unit length and the Reynolds number can be expressed solely a function of the total solidity of the network (particle solidity plus fiber solidity) for fiber solidities in 0.03-0.20 range and particle solidities in the 0.0-0.08 range. The effective diameter, employed in both non-dimensionalization of the pressure drop and the Reynolds number definition, is found to depend upon the first and second moments of the fiber diameter distribution functions, and the second and third moments of the particle diameter distribution functions. We develop a regression equation to fit calculation results; the functional form of the equation is based upon a linear combination of the low and high solidity limits for the permeability term in Darcy's Law. We additionally apply this pressure drop relationship in loading simulations to examine the evolution of filter pressure drop and figure of merit as loading proceeds. Test results on model filters show that the pressure drop increases significantly as loading proceeds, with loading of the front regions of filters contributing most significantly to the pressure drop. Interestingly, model results suggest that the figure of merit first increases upon loading and then decreases, justifying preloading of filters to increase performance. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The direct spinning process is a useful method for continuously synthesizing carbon nanotube (CNT) fibers. A reactor should be designed based on reactor design principles in order to study the synthesis mechanism and mass production of CNT fibers. The internal temperature in a continuous flow reactor depends on the length of the reactor, and because the temperatures required for the decomposition of various feedstocks differ, each feedstock is decomposed at a different point in the reactor. Here, we report that high-quality CNT fibers were continuously synthesized by water injection at temperatures above the catalyst-forming range during the direct spinning process, as determined by the decomposition temperatures of the feedstocks. The decomposition temperatures of the feedstock materials were measured. Thiophene and toluene decomposed at 500-600 degrees C and 600-700 degrees C, respectively, and these temperatures were lower than those reported in the literature. The quality of the CNT fibers was improved by injecting water into zones with temperatures that exceeded the decomposition temperatures of the feedstocks in the reactor. Oxygen containing functional groups formed less often on the CNT surfaces, further improving the quality of CNT fibers. Moreover, the CNT fibers were continuously synthesized, even if excess water were injected. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Stirred tank bioreactors are one of the most widely used bio-fermentation systems at both the laboratory and factory scale for the production of high value bioproducts. However, conventional systems suffer from irreconcilable contradictions to ensure adequate volumetric oxygen mass transfer rates (k(L)a) the necessary operating conditions to increase the energy consumption and the shear conditions. Adaptation of systems that incorporate microbubbles (MBs) generated by microporous sparger are advantageous for high viscosity and low shear stress bio-fermentation systems due to their superior k(L)a's, high gas-liquid interfacial area to volume ratios, high gas holdup, and slow coalescence rates. Herein, we describe the development of a novel microbubble-based stirred tank bioreactor (MSTBR) using a sintered porous metal plate impeller as gas sparger that produces MBs in both Newtonian and non-Newtonian fluids. The MSTBR showed increased k(L)a and improved the gas holdup by forming an abundance of MBs, while avoiding the high shear stress and reducing the mixing energy consumption that are typically caused by utilization of Rushton turbine impellers. To validate the robustness of the MSTBR, arachidonic acid (ARA)-rich oil was produced from the shear-sensitive, high oxygen consuming filamentous fungus Mortierella alpine. The total ARA content produced using the MSTBR system was found to be 2.82 times that of the control bioreactor. Taken together, our data indicates that the new MSTBR bio-fermentation system can be broadly utilized in applications requiring elevated oxygen levels, shear-sensitive microorganisms, and high viscosity medium during the bio-fermentation process.

AB This paper presents a study on control of nanoparticles dispersion in the hard and soft segments of a polyurethane (PU) membrane, via adjusting surface groups of the nanoparticles. The dispersion control allows for tailoring physical and transport properties of the membrane. PU-based mixed-matrix membranes (MMMs) embedded with cyanuric chloride and its derivatives, melamine, and 2,4,6-trihydazino-1,3,5-triazine (THDT) nanoparticles, are prepared. The MMMs are characterized using FTIR, XRD, TGA, DSC, and SEM analyses, and tensile strength tests. Peak assignment of the bonded carbonyl, crystallinity change, mechanical properties of the membranes, possible hydrogen-bonding of the PU backbone and the nanoparticles, and permeation tests indicate that cyanuric chloride nanoparticles are dispersed in the hard segments, whereas melamine and the THDT nanoparticles are distributed in the soft domains. As the cyanuric chloride nanoparticle concentration of the MMMs increases, the gas permeabilities and O-2/N-2, CO2/CH4 and CO2/N-2 selectivities of the membranes increase. In the case of THDT and melamine, as the filler loading increases, the permeabilities of the gases decrease, whereas O-2/N-2, CO2/CH4 and CO2/N-2 selectivities increase. A 10 wt% incorporation of THDT into the PU increases CO2/N-2 and CO2/CH4 selectivities by 92% and 75%, respectively. These results point to the potential of cyanuric chloride nanoparticles for simultaneous improvement of gas permeability and selectivity, and the potential of melamine and THDT nanoparticles for preparation of highly selective nanocomposite membranes for CO2 removal.

AB This paper presents a numerical study of the inhomogeneous platinum loading within the catalyst layer (CL) and porosity inside the gas diffusion layer (GDL) at the cathode of a proton exchange membrane fuel cell. Their distributions along the in-plane (longitudinal) direction and the effect of their interactions on the cell performance and current density uniformity are investigated. The mathematic model is validated by a series of experimental results at various conditions. A strong interaction of platinum loading and GDL porosity on performance is revealed, and a significant impact of GDL porosity on the optimal platinum gradients exists, due to the correlations between the electrochemical reaction rate and species transport rate. When the initial platinum loading and GDL porosity are high at the cathode inlet, individually increasing the platinum loading near the outlet cannot improve the cell performance and current density uniformity. Systematically controlling the gradients of platinum loading and GDL porosity achieves a more uniform distribution of current density within the membrane electrode assembly. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Experiments on the gas-liquid-solid mini-fluidized beds with sizes of 1.45 and 2.3 mm show that the bed diameter has a considerable effect on the phase holdups and gas bubble size, because the macroscopic dimension (macro-scale) in a mini-fluidized bed is close to the dimensions of bubbles (meso-scale) and particles (micro-scale). Hence, the parameter of bed diameter was introduced through the modifications on the energy-minimization multi-scale (EMMS) model for the conventional three-phase mini-fluidized beds to predict the flow behavior of three-phase mini-fluidized bed. These modifications include two correction factors for the liquid and bubble slip velocities and a constraint condition on the bubble coalescence. The correction on the liquid slip velocity is to estimate the effect of column shear stress on the distribution of liquid velocity. The other correction factor is for quantifying the column resistance on the bubble rise. The correction factors were determined by the empirical correlations obtained from the experiments. Similarly, the bubble coalescence constraint is a correlation on the bubble spacing under steady state condition and determined from the experimental data. The modified meso-scale model equations were closed by this constraint condition and the solution of the model met the principle of energy minimization. The model predictions and experimental data agree well within the investigation range of experimental conditions. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In this study, an advanced radioactive particle tracking (RPT) technique was used to investigate for the first time the details of the cells' movements (trajectory) and multiphase flow hydrodynamics during microalgae culturing in a cylindrical split airlift photobioreactor. The cells' trajectory, liquid velocity field, distributions of shear stresses, and the turbulent kinetic energy field were studied under superficial gas velocity of 1 and 3 cm/s. The structures of the flow in the whole reactor, the riser, the downcomer, as well as the structure above and below the split plate were characterized. The effects of the cells' concentration and different aeration rate at different axial levels on the studied parameters were discussed. It has been found that the cells' fluctuations reduced and its movement frequency between the light (wall) and dark zone decreased during the culturing particularly when the cells concentrations becomes large after 30 days of culturing. Distinguishing behaviors were observed for all the parameters, with a higher magnitude at the superficial gas velocity 3 cm/sec than at 1 cm/sec. This effect positively enhanced the liquid circulation and the movement between the reactor sides, the riser, and the downcomer. This circulation and good mixing phenomena had a large positive impact on the culture's continuity. The obtained results are reliable as benchmark data to validate computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation and other models that can be later used to be integrated with dynamic growth and light intensity models for optimized.

AB The effect of meso-scale structures on hydrodynamic predictions is not considered in the classically uniform drag models when the coarse grid is used. To address this issue, this study tries to develop an effective three-marker drag correlation via straightforward sub-grid modeling, which accounts for a parabolic spatial concentration distribution within a computational grid. The reliability and accuracy of the developed model is then assessed in detail. How the uniform drag inputs affect the derived sub-grid correction is quantified for the first time. Besides, a comprehensive comparison between several typical sub-grid models and present work is implemented. Results reveal a systematic dependence of our drag modification on the concentration gradient as an additional marker. Coarse-grid hydrodynamic validation shows that the developed model yields a fairly improved agreement with experiments under various operating conditions in a 3D turbulent fluidized bed. Furthermore, results demonstrate that the present model using different uniform drag inputs still can exhibit satisfactory performance. The developed model is able to resolve the heterogeneous flow behavior both cheaply and adequately, which is potentially applied for industrial reactor design and optimization. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The Taylor bubble velocity for gas-liquid flows, which is of great importance in multiphase flow models, has been thoroughly studied for a wide range of conditions in full pipe flows. The applicability of models developed for these full pipe systems to flows in annuli has not been fully verified as very little data are available. This work presents experimental data on concentric and fully eccentric horizontal and 4 degrees upward annulus for gas-liquid flows at high-pressure (400 kPa, absolute). The test fluids are water and Exxsol D60 as the liquid phases and sulphur hexafluoride (SF6) as the gas phase. The test section consists of a 45 m long PVC pipe with an annulus pipe diameter ratio of K= 0.505 and an inside diameter of the outer pipe of 99 mm. Gamma densitometer sensors have been used to measure the instantaneous cross-sectional average holdup at different locations along the test section. Results show that the bubble velocity follows a linear trend, similar to that observed in full pipe systems, with a critical Froude number at Fr-M,Fr-C approximate to 3.3. For Froude numbers lower than the critical value, the bubble velocity is well predicted by models developed for full pipe using the hydraulic diameter. For higher Froude numbers, a new correlation has been developed based on the experimental observations with excellent agreement for all cases studied. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Spherical pellets for pharmaceutical applications are widely produced by an extrusion-spheronization process. To achieve an equal, spherical pellet shape with a spheronization process, it is crucial that all pellets are exposed to similar stress conditions. However, in a spheronizer the pellets close to the friction plate are subjected to much higher stresses than pellets at the top of the torus, resulting in a strongly inhomogeneous stress distribution within the particle bed. Therefore, the product quality depends in particular on the mixing process in the spheronizer. In this study, the mixing behavior in a spheronization process is analyzed using DEM simulations. The real geometry and realistic process parameters of a lab scale spheronizer were investigated. To determine the mechanical properties of the wet pellets for the contact model, various single particle experiments were conducted with MCC-based pellets produced by extrusion-spheronization. The spatial mixing was characterized in different ways. Besides the determination of the degree of mixing based on statistical analysis, the Fokker-Planck equation was utilized. In this way the spatial distribution of the degree of mixing over the time was obtained. By using the poloidal distribution of the transport and dispersion coefficients of the Fokker-Planck equation the course of the degree of mixing in the different zones of the spheronizer was clarified.

AB In recent years, due to their advantages on good stability, non-volatility, tunable viscosity and tailormade properties, ionic liquids (ILs) have been regarded as novel potential solvents and alternative media for gas separation. However, the various cations and anions representing the ILs, together with limited experimental data, make it challenging to predict gas solubility in ILs and identify the optimal IL for a specific gas separation. In this work, a comprehensive Henry's law constants database is first established for gas-IL which supplements an already established extensive gas solubility database. Because of the insufficient experimental data for both IL-C2H4 and IL-C2H6 systems, the COSMO-RS model is used after validation to generate additional pseudo-experimental data. Then, together with the sufficient experimental data of CO2-IL and CH4-IL systems, UNIFAC-IL is developed for the prediction of four-component shale gas (CH4, C2H4, C2H6, CO2 ) solubility in ILs. A relatively good agreement between the model predicted and the experimental solubility data is observed. Moreover, the developed UNIFAC-IL model can be used to predict the solubility of gases in new ILs that are not included in parameter fitting due to its group contribution basis. For this reason, the model represents a very useful tool for task-specific design of ionic liquids for gas separations. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Control of the nucleation step - the first and most important step in the crystallization process - is crucial for obtaining a desired crystalline product with defined properties such as shape, size and size distribution.
   For batch crystallization, much effort has been made to identify and investigate the various parameters that affect the conditions under which nucleation takes place. In this context, a promising approach to control the events at the beginning of crystallization can be seen in the use of bottled pure synthetic air to induce nucleation. This process is called gassing crystallization. In this paper, for the first time gassing with synthetic air was applied to induce nucleation in a continuously operated single-stage MSMPR crystallizer. To determine the operating boundaries of an MSMPR cascade and to monitor the process, a self-constructed conductivity probe was used, which represents an inexpensive process analytical technology tool. The experimental results for the binary model system L-alanine/water demonstrate that gassing shows a great potential to carry out the nucleation step in a controlled manner, thus enabling the production of crystals with a constant product quality.

AB Multiscale methods have recently underpinned the successful simulation of gas-solid flow. In our prior study (Chen and Wang, AIChE Journal, 2017, 63: 3681-3691), a dynamic multiscale method (DMM) has been proposed to concurrently couple different simulation models in different simulation domains where discrete particle model (DPM) is used in the near wall regions and the rest of simulation domain is solved by two-fluid model (TFM). In this study, a mesoscale-structure-based mapping method was further proposed and implemented into the framework of DMM. The recently developed EMMS-based particle velocity distribution function (Wang et al., AIChE Journal, 2016, 62: 2649-2657), which was derived by assuming that there is a two-phase structure in a computational grid, was used for mapping between different models. In addition, the stability condition of the EMMS model was undertaken to locate the newly inserted particles during the boundary mapping process from the TFM to the DPM. The simulation results of gas-solid flow in a riser containing Geldart B particles using the proposed DMM have compared with those of using the full TFM and full DPM, which verifies its fidelities.

AB As the amount of waste plastic increases, thermo-chemical conversion of plastics provides an economic flexible and environmental friendly method to manage recycled plastics, and generate valuable materials, such as carbon nanotubes (CNTs). The choice of catalysts and reaction parameters are critical to improving the quantity and quality of CNTs production. In this study, a ceramic membrane catalyst (Ni/Al2O3) was studied to control the CNTs growth, with reaction parameters, including catalytic temperature and Ni content investigated. A fixed two-stage reactor was used for thermal pyrolysis of plastic waste, with the resulting CNTs characterized by various techniques including scanning electronic microscopy (SEM), transmitted electronic microscopy (TEM), temperature programmed oxidation (TPO), and X-ray diffraction (XRD). It is observed that different loadings of Ni resulted in the formation of metal particles with various sizes, which in turn governs CNTs production with varying degrees of quantity and quality, with an optimal catalytic temperature at 700 degrees C.

AB A formulation for parameter estimation in cubic equations of state (CEOS) models for phase equilibrium thermodynamics is proposed. This formulation guarantees for the regressed parameters that the predicted mole fractions correspond to stable equilibria, when standard methods fail and demonstrably entail erroneous process simulation results. The present formulation overcomes these deficiencies, which is predicated on a bilevel structure extending Mitsos et al. (2009a). That is, an upper-level (parameter fitting) problem is minimized, subject to multiple lower-level problems, which encode thermodynamic stability. The CEOS constitutes an equality constraint on the lower level, which adds to the difficulty of the bilevel program. For the VLE of C5H12/H2S, it is demonstrated that the method permits an acceptable fit with physically sensible CEOS root values. Thus, the regressed parameter values may be applied to, e.g., process simulation. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This paper provides a review on the flow of free-flowing coarse particles inside silos. Basic principles and elementary mechanisms involved in gravity flow of granular materials are discussed. The main focus is put on flow patterns, stress distribution, velocity profiles, mass flowrate, Residence Time Distribution (RTD) and segregation inside the silo. A summary of empirical correlations as well as a synthesis of more physical and mechanistic models related to these aspects are presented. Computational and numerical methods used to describe the granular flow of particles will be discussed in a separate paper. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In this work, we study unidirectional, fully developed, layered two-phase flows in microchannels, where the interface meets the wall at an arbitrary contact angle. Interfacial tension causes the interface to take the form of a circular arc, with a radius that depends on the contact angle. The momentum equations must therefore be solved on a domain with boundaries that are, in general, not iso-coordinate surfaces. We adopt the technique developed by Shankar (2005a), which extends the use of eigenfunctions to arbitrary shaped domains, and apply it to layered flows for rectangular and circular cross-sections of the channel. This method is computationally efficient and allows us to analyze in detail the effect of the contact angle on flow properties. We focus on the case of a rectangular channel, which is commonly encountered in microfluidic applications, and consider two distinct cases: (a) free interface whose equilibrium contact angle is a function of fluid wetting properties, and (b) pinned interface whose apparent contact angle is determined by fluid flow rates. We calculate the relationship between the volume fractions (holdups) and flow rate fractions of the fluids and show that a non-zero contact angle can significantly restrict the range of permissible flow rates. This range is greater when the less viscous fluid has a greater affinity for the wall. For fixed flow rates, the residence time of a fluid is found to increase as its affinity for the wall increases. The pressure drop, which directly impacts operational costs, is found to be lower when the more viscous fluid is more wetting. This non-intuitive result is explained in terms of the corresponding variation in fluid volume fractions. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Aluminum phosphate (AlPO4) bound HZSM-5 extrudates were prepared with different Al/P ratios, and characterized with respect to the species chemical state, surface morphology, pore structure, and acidity, in comparison to conventional alumina bound and as-received HZSM-5 zeolite catalyst. The binder results in decrease in micropore volume implying blockage of micro channels within the zeolite crystal. AlPO4 binder forms dense amorphous matrix, while alumina forms a porous matrix with significant increase in mesopore volume and surface area. Moreover, both of the bound samples exhibit decreases in acidity strength and sites number, while the alumina bound one shows an increase in strong acidity strength which implies an enhancement of the acid stability of the strong acid sites. The reaction performance experiments on the simulated MTP operating conditions show that compared to alumina bound catalyst the AlPO4-bound type exhibits much lower paraffins and aromatics yields, and particularly that the polymer grade propylene may be easily obtained without C-3 splitter, though the lifetime assessment reveals that alumina is much superior to AlPO4 as the binder.

AB Free surfaces of large bubbles are involved in gas injection into liquid through a top-submerged lance. The Volume of Fluid (VOF) multiphase model is chosen to simulate these flows. However, the selection of an appropriate turbulence model remains a point of discussion. Therefore, three representative turbulence models, namely the Renormalization Group (RNG) k-epsilon model, the Reynolds Stress model (RSM) and the Large Eddy Simulation (LES) model, respectively coupled with VOF simulations, are studied. The results are compared with Particle Imaging Velocimetry (PIV) experiments. Afterwards, the selected turbulence model is used to study the two-phase flow characteristics. It has been found that the three turbulence models are able to capture the main averaged features of the flow such as the flow structures and average velocity field. However, the RNG and RSM models are not capable of estimating the fluctuating flow parameters such as the Reynolds stresses. In contrast, the LES model gives very good agreement with experimental data. The subsequent study on flow characteristics also showed that the 3D VOF-LES model can describe the bubble behavior and surface fluctuation. Resorting to Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) method, it has been proven that the bubble frequency is around 20 Hz and the turbulence in the bubbly region is between the single phase -5/3 and two-phase -10/3 power law in the inertial sub-range. Finally, the effect of the contact angle between the formed bubbles and outer lance wall on the flow has been estimated. The results showed that contact angle has limited influence on the flow.

AB Designing and optimizing packed-bed methanation reactors for power-to-gas leads to conflicting issues. Because of the high exothermicity of the reaction, it might be inefficient (low Gas Hourly Space Velocity), or unsafe (runaway, thermal degradation). Dynamically operating reactors are thus particularly difficult to design. In this paper, the behavior of a reactor with multiple catalyst-dilution zones is studied numerically. Simulations of a dynamic sequence (reactor startup) are carried out. The effect of catalyst dilution profile on steady state and transient efficiency is analyzed. We introduce a method to maximize GHSV, while guarantying safe operation during both transient and steady state operation. A proper catalyst dilution profile can increase the steady state efficiency and stability of the reactor. However, the results of the present study show that this dilution profile can have a negative impact on transient efficiency and stability. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB At high catalyst volume fractions the Fischer-Tropsch synthesis (FTS) operated in a slurry bubble column (SBC) is driven into the mass transfer limited regime. This study utilized literature models for the gas-liquid mass transfer coefficients in a multifluid-population balance model in which the gas-phase composition was a function of bubble size. The results confirmed that mass transfer limitations occur and that the choice of mass transfer coefficient model is crucial, yielding final conversion results ranging from 45% to 92% depending on the choice of k(L) models. At smaller k(L) values the composition is highly dependent on bubble size, whilst for the largest k(L) values the composition is not a function of bubble size at all. The population balance modeling (PBM) allowed for explicitly keeping track of the bubble size distribution. Varying the inlet Sauter-mean diameter (SMD) resulted in a linear decrease in conversion as the inlet SMD was increased from 5 mm to 20 mm. Illustrative models for the bubble size dependency of k(L) were implemented, which provided additional information compared to traditional models which use (bubble size) averaged values for the liquid-phase mass transfer coefficient k(L) and/or the gas-liquid interfacial area a and composition.

AB In an anion exchange membrane, OH conduction is closely related to the affinity of the functional group and membrane morphology. This relationship can change when the water uptake of the membrane varies. To explore the effect of the water uptake on the affinity of the functional group to OH and the membrane morphology, a series of molecular dynamics simulations based on an all-atom force field were performed for the imidazolium-grafted PPO (Im-g-PPO) membranes with different water uptakes. The simulation results of the membrane density, water and OH self-diffusivity, and OH conductivity verify the accuracy of the simulation systems. The local distributions of OH and water around the imidazolium group indicate that increasing water uptake enhances the hydration structure of the imidazolium group and weakens the affinity of the imidazolium group to OH . The critical water saturation of imidazolium group could produces suitable affinity to the surrounding OH . When the imidazolium group is water saturated, further increasing water uptake is not conducive to retaining the affinity to OH . As a result, the critical water saturation of the imidazolium group balances between the affinity to OH and the transfer of OH in the hydrated Im-g-PPO membrane. Furthermore, it also produces a percolated hydrophilic channel and maintains a relatively high mechanical strength of the Im-g-PPO membrane. Therefore, the imidazolium groups should be maintained under the critical water saturation, where two and eight water molecules are retained in the first and second hydration shells, respectively. This work provides a molecular-level understanding of the effect of the hydration structure of the imidazolium group on OH conduction and the morphology of the Im-g-PPO membrane. It also provides potential guidance for main- taining high performance in anion exchange membrane fuel cells. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Catalytic oxidation is widely acknowledged as the most promising technology for the conversion of hydrocarbon feedstocks to a variety of bulk industrial chemicals. The formation of undesired by-products through secondary gas-phase reactions has been underscored as the limiting step for this technology. In this study, microwave heating is proposed to challenge the evolution of undesired by-products based on the exclusive selective heating mechanism. This task is accomplished through a significantly higher solid (as microwave receptors) temperature compared to the gas phase temperature according to the principles of microwave irradiation approach. In order to highlight the influence of microwave heating on the overall performance of a gas-solid fluidized bed reactor, a simulation study was attempted for a model reactive system. Thus, catalytic oxidation of n-butane over the fluidized vanadium phosphorous oxide catalyst to produce maleic anhydride was selected as the model reaction. The bed hydrodynamics was described by a dynamic two-phase flow model while a kinetic model, adopted from the available literature, represented the reaction feature of the reactor. The original experimental data from a lab-scale microwave-heated fluidized bed reactor and the respective energy balance modeling were employed to describe the temperature distribution between bulk, solids, and gas segments of the simulated bed for the microwave heating scenario. The simulation study indicated that when competitive gas and solid phase reactions are occurring in a gas-solid fluidized bed reactor, the application of microwave selective heating approach can significantly enhance the overall performance of the reactor in comparison with the conventional heating, where solids, bulk, and bed temperatures are identical. Consequently, the application of microwave heating has been proposed as a promising approach to promote catalytic selective oxidation of hydrocarbons. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Emerging products for an ultra-energy-efficient economy demand new amorphous and nanocrystalline thin metallic glass (TMG) alloys. Planar flow casting (PFC) is the rapid solidification process of choice for forming TMGs. In this paper, TMG and crystalline alloys are demonstrated to process similarly by PFC despite their well-known different solid-state atomic structures. The high-fragility of the TMG alloy is argued to be responsible. A simple scaling law for ribbon thickness is reported. Thickness depends on the thermal properties of the alloy and heat transfer characteristic of the PFC machine. Perhaps surprisingly, explicit knowledge of the viscosity of the glass is not needed. Dimensional reasoning, mathematical modeling and experiment for two different alloys on two different PFC machines are the methods employed. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In this study, we examine directed self-assembly of micro- and nanoparticles on a vibrating substrate as a viable pathway to large-scale assembly of microstructures and composite materials. We demonstrate the vibration-driven assembly of glass bead microparticles and iron oxide nanoparticles in contact with a photocurable hydrogel (PEGDA) over an area of 3000 mm(2). The competition between acoustic radiation force and vibration-generated fluid flow in a viscous medium above a vibrating plate determines the particle transport characteristics. Based on a suspension balance model of this competition, we find that glass microparticles are dominated by displacement gradients and migrate towards displacement antinodes. Iron oxide nanoparticles that are smaller than the characteristic boundary layer generated by the flow will drive particles towards displacement nodes. We find close agreement between the observed experimental results when compared to a numerical solution to the 2D wave equation that governs this case. We also demonstrate that patterns assembled by vibration for glass microparticles or iron oxide nanoparticles dispersed in PEGDA can be immobilized by a UV light, allowing this approach to be used as a fabrication process for heterogeneously structured particle-polymer composites. The composites produced by this technique are robust and can be held by hand for application to tunable material properties for applications to bioelectronics and soft robotics.

TI Synthesis of a quantitative strategy to minimize energy used in

AB The conditioning of room air in summer is widely practiced. However many operators do not have an overall quantitative strategy for minimizing energy. Widespread practice is to simply use on-off, that is, have air conditioning-on when a room is occupied, and conditioning-off, when un-occupied. Here we apply the probabilistic Fr 13 risk framework (Chem. Eng. Sci. 152 (2016) 213-226) for the first time to take account of naturally occurring fluctuations in daily ambient peak temperature (T-o), occupancy rates (L-T) and room traffic inflow and outflows (n) in a typical (hotel) room fitted with heat-attenuating curtains in the hot and dry clime of South Eastern Australia (latitude -37.819708, longitude 144.959936). We use this to synthesise an extended steady-state unit-operations model and assess the two energy strategies for conditioning of the room air to a widely used auto-set bulk temperature of 22 degrees C. It was assumed the impact on overall energy demand from room lighting and refrigerator and occupant metabolism was negligible. We show incident radiative energy will be significant, and using historical ambient temperature fluctuations and occupancy rates, that adoption of the alternative on-only continuous conditioning would use less energy in 93.6% of summer days, based on an overall commercially viable L-T = 75% with the minimum possible room traffic flow of n = 1. Practically, this equates to six (6) only failures of this alternative energy strategy in the 90 days of summer. Importantly, the probabilistic Fr 13 framework permits a practical design for larger-scale quantitative testing of the proposed strategy. A preliminary 10-day 'proof-of-concept' trial showed energy savings of 18.9% (AUD $2.23 per suite (paired-room) per day) with a concomitant 20.7% reduction in GHG. Findings will be of immediate interest and benefit to operators and managers of large buildings that rely on conditioning of dry air in summer. Crown Copyright (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Unraveling the structural and kinetic consequences of catalyst properties, which vary with the catalyst preparation methods, on their catalytic behaviors is of prime scientific and industrial importance. Exemplified by Pt/CNT-catalyzed hydrolytic dehydrogenation of ammonia borane (AB), this work examines the origin of the crucial impacts of the catalyst reduction methods (i.e., in situ reduction with AB and ex situ reduction with H-2) on the surface and electronic properties of the catalyst as well as the consequent hydrogen generation activity and durability. Kinetic and isotopic analyses reveal that the Pt/CNT-ex situ catalyst has low activation energy and a strong ability to activate water. The relationship between the catalyst structure and performance is established, and the unique surface (e.g., fewer Pt-O bonds) and electronic properties (e.g., higher Pt binding energy) of the Pt/CNT-ex situ catalyst are deemed to be responsible for the high activity and durability. The insights reported in this work highlight the importance of understanding the preparation-structure-performance relationship to guide the rational design of catalysts. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Fluid transport through membrane has attracted broad interests in recent decades due to their close association with wide industrial applications. Whereas massive experimental and simulation studies have been reported, the molecular mechanisms of fluid transport in nanopores are still poorly understood. Herein, we report a non-equilibrium molecular dynamics (NEMD) simulation study for elaborating the confinement effect of water transport through carbon nanotube (CNT) membranes. By varying the tube flexibility, inner surface wettability and pore size distribution (PSD), the permeability of water flow characterized with the flux enhancement rate is extensively examined. In addition, the pore size effect and pore size distribution are carefully taken into account when evaluating the apparent water flux through CNT membranes. We show that these treatments allow us to predict the water flux in a satisfactory agreement with reported experimental measurements. This work provides a quantitative simulation model toward the rational design of high efficient membranes. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB A thermodynamic model for bubble growth in superheated liquid mixture was developed to investigate the heat transfer and mass diffusion mechanisms. The influence of component concentration and liquid temperature on bubble growth characteristics is the main focus of the present study. In the proposed model, the energy equation and the component diffusion equation for the liquid were coupled with the assumed quadratic temperature and concentration distribution within the liquid boundary layer. The vapor-liquid equilibrium of the binary mixture was estimated by the non-random two-liquid (NRTL) equation. The comparison between the current calculated results with the available experimental data demonstrates the accuracy of the proposed bubble growth model. The results show that the later stage of bubble growth in a binary mixture is primarily controlled by mass diffusion and also influenced by heat transfer. The bubble growth characteristics strongly depend on the mass fraction of the more volatile component and the liquid temperature. Both higher liquid temperature and concentration of the light component are beneficial to enhance the bubble growth. The effect of mass diffusion on bubble growth becomes weaker with increasing liquid temperature and decreasing initial mass fraction of the more volatile component. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB An unsteady forced slip velocity has an important effect on the flow conditions adjacent to a membrane interface, which can help control concentration polarisation (CP) and fouling. This study explores the effect of non-sinusoidal slip velocity waveforms on mass transfer and shear stress in membrane channels. The hydrodynamics and mass transfer of unobstructed and obstructed membrane channels under the influence of slip velocity are simulated using two-dimensional computational fluid dynamics (CFD). At a Reynolds number where vortex shedding occurs, the results show that both sinusoidal and non-sinusoidal slip velocity profiles cause a similar increase in mass transfer and shear stress. However, for systems without vortex shedding, a non-sinusoidal waveform with a sudden decrease in slip velocity can significantly increase maximum shear stress (by over 20%). This effect shows a clear advantage of non-sinusoidal slip velocity profiles over sinusoidal slip velocity profiles. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The performance of three membrane adsorber formats containing the same membrane type is comparatively analyzed. Membrane volumes range from 3 mL to 1.6 L, and above in parallel operation. Orthogonal modeling of internal flow patterns and binding properties is crucial for transferring model parameters across devices and scales. The binding rates are found to depend on the flow rate through convective transport in the macropores of the membrane. Breakthrough curves of large scale devices are successfully predicted using information acquired at smaller scales provided membrane properties, particularly binding capacity, are identical.

AB To increase the operating range for cavitating quantitative mixing devices, a new jet pump is proposed. The distribution of pressure, velocity, turbulent dissipation rate, and vapor bubbles were studied numerically, and the influence of geometric parameters and flow ratio on the operating range were investigated experimentally. The proposed jet pump overlaps the high turbulence and low pressure regions at the nozzle exit, causing significant cavitation. When the cross section near the diffuser inlet is filled with vapor bubbles, the jet pump reaches its operating limit. Since the structure of suction chamber remains the same as conventional jet pumps, increasing secondary flow deforms the axisymmetric cavity cloud, which leads to quick reduction of the critical pressure ratio. Empirical curves are proposed to optimize the area ratio for given flow ratios, based on experimental tests of nine jet pumps. When the critical flow ratio <1.4% for a given optimal area ratio, the critical pressure ratio >0.8, which is significantly higher than current jet pumps. Reliability of the proposed jet pump was examined when operating as quantitative mixing device and flow meter simultaneously. When the flow ratio <4%, changes of area ratio, flow ratio, and viscosity of the working fluid have no effect flow rate measurement accuracy, and flow rate error <3.32% under all test conditions.

AB A study of non-linear stability analysis using co-dimension two (i.e., two free parameters being varied) bifurcations related to pressure drop oscillations (PDO) in a heated channel has been carried out in this paper. In the existing literature, in the context of PDO, mostly linear stability analysis is done. A few works on non-linear stability analysis are available; however, only co-dimension one bifurcation studies of PDO have been carried out in these works. However, in practice, since the inlet temperature of the coolant is also an independent operating parameter, both inlet temperature, and inlet mass flow rate need to be considered for stability analysis. It is also noted that the existing plethora of studies on PDO is limited to the prediction of supercritical Hopf bifurcation only. However, in the current study, two types of Hopf bifurcations have been identified namely subcritical and supercritical. A subcritical Hopf bifurcation exhibits unstable limit cycles, which is a signature of the existence of unstable solutions for slightly larger perturbations even in the linearly stable region. The existence of unstable solutions indicates that linear stability analysis is not sufficient to identify the overall stability behavior. Also, a generalized Hopf point on the stability boundary has been identified which denotes a boundary between subcritical and supercritical Hopf bifurcation. Furthermore, numerical simulations are carried out in different regions (both stable and unstable) of the parameter space to understand the non-linear phenomena of the system. Moreover, the bifurcations are explained in terms of the interaction of the external and internal characteristic curves of the system. The large and small amplitude cycles are shown in the characteristic curves of the system. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The CO2 sequestration is a multiphase and multi-material process in which the meshless method is advantageous to play a role in addressing the problems. In this study, the meshless approximations of the Moving Particle Semi-implicit method (MPS) are applied to model the convective mixing in the CO2 sequestration. In the numerical method, the domain is discretized into a set of material points or particles and the spatial derivatives in the meshless method are adopted to solve the governing equations. In the simulations, both the homogeneous and layered geological formations are investigated. It is found that the dissolution-diffusion-convection process in the convective mixing is reproduced by the numerical method. The calculated averaged CO2 dissolution agrees well with the results from a linear analysis in the homogeneous geological setting. The simulated time for the CO2 concentration to arrive at the bottom is in agreement with that calculated from the finite volume approach for various Rayleigh numbers. After validation of the numerical method, investigation is conducted to calculate the fingering structure, mixing length, and CO2 dissolution rate in the problem. The convective mixing in the layered formation is also simulated and it shows that the non-homogeneous formation plays a significant role in the CO2 dissolution as the fingering structure is affected. These simulations with both homogeneous and non-homogeneous cases clearly show that the numerical approximations show good performance in reproducing the phenomenon of the convective mixing and the meshless method can be potentially applied to handle multiphase and multi-material problems in the CO2 sequestration.

AB Spontaneous imbibition in a porous medium is known to have two macroscopic fronts, the leading one in narrow pores and the lagging front in the wider pores. This behavior contradicts the behavior predicted by Washburn law due to interaction of the pores in the porous medium. In this work, we investigate the spontaneous imbibition behavior in a randomly arranged interacting capillaries system and propose a one dimensional Washburn like model which can be used to upscale the porous medium properties. We first use Volume of Fluid (VOF) simulations, which tracks the fluid-fluid interface in the multiphase flow, and show several approximations that can be used to develop a quasi one-dimensional Washburn like model for interacting capillaries. Using these approximations, we build a model for two and three capillary systems, which is able to mimic the spontaneous imbibition in a three-dimensional interacting capillary system simulated using VOF. The one-dimensional model for three capillaries shows a strong dependence of the spontaneous imbibition behavior on the arrangement of the interacting capillaries and their relative radii. We show using the one-dimensional model, that the meniscus does not always lead in the smallest radius capillary in the interacting system. We also show that the spontaneous imbibition in the whole system also deviates from the Washburn like diffusive behavior. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB We present a generalized reaction-adsorption modeling and simulation (GRAMS) framework that captures both reaction and adsorption dynamics in columns with solid catalysts, porous adsorbents or both. It is based on a 1-dimensional, pseudo-homogeneous, non-isothermal, non-adiabatic and non-isobaric model that is extensively validated using experimental data from literature for different adsorption-reaction systems. For demonstrating the capabilities of the high-fidelity framework, simulations are performed for several configurations of a packed-column system containing (i) pure catalyst as in a fixed bed reactor, (ii) pure adsorbent as in a multi-step pressure swing adsorption (PSA) process, (iii) homogeneously-distributed uniform mixture of adsorbent and catalyst as in a cyclic sorption enhanced reaction process (SERP), and (iv) heterogeneously-compartmentalized adsorbent and catalyst as in a layered SERP. The model predictions show good agreement with experimental observations for sorption-enhanced steam methane reforming (SE-SMR), sorption-enhanced water gas shift reaction (SE-WGSR), PSA processes and conventional SMR. The framework is also used for evaluating the performance of a novel process with integrated SE-SMR and reverse water gas shift reaction (RWGSR) for direct naturalgas-to-syngas conversion. GRAMS is implemented such that it can be used for optimal design and intensification of novel, modular and multi-functional processes by combining multiple phenomena within a single unit.

AB Much of the existing literature on attainable region (AR) theory has focused on finding it from a single feed. Yet, many industrial processes involve multiple feed streams and thus the total set of achievable states within a reactive process is affected by the number and type of feeds available. In this paper, we describe conditions for which multiple feeds change the dimension of the space belonging to the AR, allowing for an expansion of the region that would otherwise be infeasible from a single feed. Under specific conditions, we describe how multiple feeds may only alter the shape and size of the AR whilst preserving its dimension to that of a single feed AR. We determine the maximum number of the parallel reactors required to achieve these new states. This is obtained from the reaction stoichiometry and feeds alone, without consideration of reaction kinetics. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The approach includes the solvent selection and flowsheet synthesis using pinch-based short-cut apparatus models which take into account of the material balances and piece-wise linearized thermodynamics (MLT models) and is limited to ternary systems. MLT models enable fast and robust identification of feasible flowsheet-solvent combinations and optimization thereof. Performant solvents are found by assessing process stream tables. Promising solvent-flowsheet combinations are evaluated using flowsheet simulation with detailed models, whereby the MLT results are in good agreement with the results of the detailed models. The approach is presented along an example of the separation of acetic acid and water. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Directly solving the multi-objective optimization problem, min [(Wst)(epsilon)], in the energy-minimization multiscale (EMMS) model for gas-solid fluidization is an unsolved problem. Currently the solution is indirect based on the original stability condition, N-st = min, which is a single-objective optimization problem and deduced by combing the physical meaning of dominant mechanisms W-st = min and epsilon = min. In this work, a direct solution framework of min [(Wst)(epsilon)] in the EMMS model is performed, and the results are compared with those of N-st = min. The excellent agreement between these two schemes indicates that the proposed new framework might be promising for solving all multi-objective optimization problems that are frequently encountered in engineering study. In this framework, the impact indexes of dominant mechanisms (W-st = min and epsilon = min in the EMMS model) are first introduced under the premise that these dominant mechanisms are of equal importance. Consequently, an extremal formulation can be established, which is the mathematical equivalent to N-st = min for the EMMS model. Such an extremal expression can be adopted as a stability condition to close the mesoscale model, which seems to be an alternative of N-st = min for the EMMS model. Encouraged by its success in the gas-solid fluidization, it is being verified in more systems. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The cubic equation of state (EoS) is widely applied for modeling fluid thermodynamic properties in chemical processes. However, in the absence of a distinguishable reference property, the supercritical extrapolation of its only temperature-dependent parameter, the alpha function, resulted in nonphysical prediction of supercritical virial coefficients and heat capacities. From a theoretical perspective, we here rigorously derive the universal temperature-dependent behavior of the alpha function, using the generalized van der Waals theory without specifying the interaction potential. To isolate the behavior of the alpha function from the EoS structure, we examine the thermodynamic functions of realistic fluids at low densities. Our study reveals that the alpha function is finite, positive, and monotonically decreases with increasing temperature. We present a set of thermodynamic requirements and accordingly revise the predictive Soave and Twu alpha functions for the Redlich-Kwong and Peng-Robinson EoSs. Our study shows that the revised alpha functions avoid the divergent virial coefficients at infinite temperature, and the nonphysical bump on the heat capacity isobars immediately above the critical temperature, demonstrating the imperative need for thermodynamic requirements for the temperature dependence of the alpha function. Joule-Thomson inversion curve and vapor-liquid equilibria are also investigated. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In this article we applied a fractal-like Vermeulen model to describe kinetic data selected from literature case-studies for CO2 adsorption onto amine-functionalised sorbents. The statistical analysis based on the Akaike information criterion demonstrated a better fitting performance of the fractal-like model with respect to its canonical counterpart in describing experimental profiles of coverage degree in the entire time range explored. The canonical kinetic model generally provided a satisfying description of dynamic data only in the early stages of the process. The fractal model accounts for the presence of an instantaneous rate coefficient which ranged between orders 10(2) and 1 min(-1). Parameters derived from the fractal-like model demonstrated that the diffusion process at the beginning of adsorption is enhanced when the sorbent has a pore network easily accessible for the adsorbate. This happens when the sorbent is characterised by a wider mean pore diameter and greater specific pore volume, and when the process temperature is raised. The heterogeneity parameter of the fractal-like model affects the time-decay of the adsorption rate coefficient. This parameter ranged between 0.16 and 0.85, and it is higher when the porous material is both rapidly occupied by CO2 molecules and displays a wider pore size distribution. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB It is shown that stoichiometric restrictions on the composition of the gross product stream diverted from the chemical-technological system (hereinafter refers to a chemical process structure where the reactor is considered the heart) define a reaction polyhedron located in a concentration space whose dimension is one less than the number of substances involved in the reaction mixture.
   A geometric relationship is established between a reaction and a balanced polyhedron expressing the law of conservation of elements, of which molecules of reacting substances are composed. It is shown that a balanced polyhedron contains a reaction polyhedron and, if their dimensions are equal, they coincide (containing a reaction polyhedron). The main features of a chemical transformation are the degree of conversion of the reagents, the selectivity and yield of the target product, which are linear functions specified on the reaction polyhedron. These functions assume an extreme value at the vertices of the reaction polyhedron and on the faces constructed on the basis of these vertices. The algorithm outlined in this work allows localizing the sets of limiting stationary (steady) states characterized by extreme values of the parameters of chemical transformation, that listed above.

AB A genetic algorithm (GA) is proposed along with a general framework for the scheduling of a typical multipurpose/product batch plant. The majority of literature regarding these problems make use of mathematical programming methods. Modelling problems in this manner leads to numerous binary variables relating to material balance and sequence of batches along long time horizons, thus resulting in large computational time. The proposed GA does not suffer the same scalability issues of mathematical programming approaches. The GA makes use of a coupled chromosome system with specific crossover and mutation functions utilised with the purpose of profit maximisation. Results show that optimal or close-to-optimal solutions can be achieved with a reduction of up to 98.53% computational time in certain cases. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The underlying mechanism and the generality of the drag correction factor C-D/C-DO, which was developed and applied in the simulation of bubble columns at elevated pressure in our recent work, was discussed in detail. With this drag model, numerical simulations of a bubble column were carried out by computational fluid dynamics (CFD) coupled with the population balance model (PBM). The complex variations of the drag correction factor and slip velocity with increasing local gas holdup were well predicted. The results confirmed that the drag correction should be based on the bubble size distribution and local gas holdup, instead of on the superficial gas velocity or overall gas holdup as commonly reported in the literature. The good predictions of the gas holdup and gas-liquid mass transfer in both water and high-viscosity liquids showed that the CFD-PBM model was powerful for the simulation of bubble columns under complex operating conditions.

AB Hydrocarbon species concentrations in the gas phase are of critical importance to elucidate catalytic cracking kinetics and riser/downer fluid dynamics. In this respect, Mid-Infrared (MIR) spectroscopy provides a singular approach to monitor chemical species conversions at various reaction times. In the MIR, the Absorption Cross Section Coefficients and Integrated Absorption Band Intensities can be related to the number of C-H bonds present in the different chemical species. The proposed methodology is based on a Group Contribution Method (GCM), which accounts for the additive contribution of molecular functionalities related to the C-H bonds present in hydrocarbons. This allows absorption spectra predictions in 3200-2800 cm(-1) region. This Group Contribution Method can be applied in conjunction with a helium-neon (HeNe) laser, with a 2949.85 cm(-1) wavenumber (3.39 mu m wavelength). The technique is validated using both 1-hexene and 1,3,5-TIPB catalytic cracking data. The importance of the proposed method is shown in the context of using a CREC Riser Simulator, a mini-fluidized laboratory scale unit invented at CREC-UWO (de Lasa, 1991). Hydrocarbon species are MIR monitored in the outer CREC Riser Simulator annulus. The data obtained can be used to extrapolate gas phase hydrocarbon conversions and fluid molar densities in risers and downers. This information can be also used to accurately predict fluid dynamics in FCC catalytic cracking units. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB The efficiency of an acidizing operation is usually assessed through ordinary well testing methods. These methods are performed only after the acidizing operation, and it is difficult to monitor and evaluate real-time efficiency of acidizing operation. Understanding the performance of the acidizing during the service, by analysis of the acidizing data is a viable approach to this costly and challenging process. The estimation of the skin changes needs an appropriate mathematical method that can handle the main aspects of an acidizing operation. It is tedious to model a real acidizing operation due to the heterogeneity of the reservoir, an unknown reaction rate of acid in reservoir condition, unwanted fluid loss, opening and closing of the wing valve, etc. In this paper, we have presented a new well testing method for calculating the skin variations of open hole vertically drilled carbonate reservoir during an acidizing operation, by using history matching of the surface pressure data. The proposed method is based on continuity equations of acid in the reservoir coupled with analytical equations of ORPM (Output Rate Prediction Method) in the wellbore. The novelty of the proposed method is using a new mass transfer coefficient in continuity equations of acid, and a mathematical approach (ORPM) for the appropriate estimation of bottomhole acid injection rate and fluid loss, that lead to a proper evaluation of the skin variation during a field acidizing operation.

AB In this study, the role of turbulence on the formulation of breakup kernels for fluid particles in dispersed multiphase flows is demonstrated. Two pieces of information for model derivations including the turbulent energy spectrum and the second-order structure function are chosen as the main candidates to extend the models for the entire turbulent spectrum, contrary to the original expressions that are limited for the inertial subrange. Further, a two-step validation procedure is proposed to incorporate the effect of turbulence for model validations, that is, the original and the extended models are compared and validated against two sets of experimental data for breakup rates. The first set covers the inertial subrange, while the second set is a dataset that includes direct measurements toward the dissipation subrange of turbulence. The results show that the predictive abilities of breakup kernels can be enhanced by the model extension, when the droplet diameters are outside the inertial subrange of turbulence. This work, thus, answers how the entire spectrum of turbulence can improve the breakup kernels and proposes a validation method to include the effect of turbulence for the validation of breakup kernels.

AB A semi-analytical model for stability analysis of natural circulation loops (NCL) with conventional localized surface heating and cooling is derived based on linear stability analysis (LSA) methodology. Considerations for local pressure losses, wall thermal inertia and finite secondary side heat transfer coefficient at cooler are given in this model. Heat losses are also incorporated to extend the scope of the model to high temperature loops like those operating with pressurized water, molten salts and liquid metals. A new parameter space is introduced for representing the stability maps. This parameter space gives a direct representation of operating variables and focuses on stability behavior at only feasible (theoretically) operating conditions for a given loop. The model is validated against the experimental data of two rectangular natural circulation loops from literature. The stability maps generated by this LSA model are further verified by simulating the dynamic behavior of NCL at various operating conditions. This is accomplished by numerically solving the non-linear governing equations of NCLs. A study is performed to find the effect of some aspects like wall thermal inertia on stability behavior of natural circulation loops. Local pressure losses and wall thermal inertia are found to have considerable effect on the stability behavior of the loops studied. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Models for predicting flows in large scale fluidized beds, such as filtered Two Fluid Models (fTFMs), must account for meso-scale phenomena that manifest spontaneously in sedimenting gas-particle suspensions. Next to the closures for interphase momentum exchange, the filtered solids stresses also require closure in such models. A budget analysis reveals that, for large filter sizes, the meso-scale solids stresses, which arise due to the particles' sub-grid velocity fluctuations, are the most important contribution to these stresses. Previously, closures for meso-scale stresses have commonly adopted a Boussinesq approach where (i) a filtered solids pressure is used to close the mean normal stress, and (ii) a filtered solids viscosity is modelled to close the deviatoric stress components. The present study highlights that such a Boussinesq approach fails to accurately predict the forces arising from the meso-scale stresses. This is primarily due to the fundamental inability of a viscosity-based formulation to approximate deviatoric stress components in sedimenting gas-particle suspensions. The present study proposes a novel anisotropic approach in which both normal (i.e., diagonal) and shear (i.e., off-diagonal) stress components are modelled individually. The proposed anisotropic closure explains resolved stress data significantly more reliably (i.e., with a correlation coefficient of R-2 approximate to 0.62) compared to a conventional Boussinesq-based approach (R-2 approximate to -0.65) using a single model equation. Finally, these findings are confirmed by evaluating different stress closures in fTFM simulations of bubbling and turbulent fluidization. These simulations indicate that the novel anisotropic stress closure leads to improved model generality and better grid independence. Most important, it is found that a classical Boussinesq-based closure leads to worse predictions compared to a complete neglect of meso-scale solids stresses. Thereby, the present study underlines that it is essential to account for anisotropy when closing the meso-scale solids stress in fTFMs. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Over the past decade, filtered Two Fluid Models (fTFMs) have emerged as a promising approach for enabling fluidized bed simulations at industrially relevant scales. In these models, the filtered drag force is considered to be the most important quantity that requires closure. To date, such closures have typically relied on an isotropic interphase momentum exchange coefficient by applying a drag correction factor to the microscopic drag closures commonly used in resolved simulations. In the present study, both isotropic and anisotropic closures are developed for predicting the filtered interphase forces. The relative performance of these two approaches is then evaluated by means of an a priori assessment, considering data obtained from simulations in which all flow variables are resolved, which were also used for closure derivation. Also, an a posteriori assessment, which compares coarse grid simulation results to a benchmark resolved simulation of a bubbling fluidized bed, is presented. The primary conclusion from the present study is that it is essential to account for the anisotropy of the filtered momentum exchange coefficient. It is shown that this can be done by employing a drift velocity formulation of the filtered drag force and by considering a gravitational contribution that only acts in the vertical direction. Furthermore, it is found that for the large computational grid sizes that are typically required in industrial scale fluidized bed simulations, a closure for the meso-scale interphase force is essential. Finally, also for coarse grids, a non-linearity correction factor, which accounts for assumptions in deriving the drift velocity-based form of the filtered drag force, requires closure. The present study therefore highlights multiple avenues for improving drag closures used in fTFMs. Hence, these results may critically strengthen the predictive capabilities of fTFMs, as well as guide future modelling efforts.

AB A microscopic mathematical model is developed for membrane based water-to-gas humidification by rigorously accounting for phase equilibrium between the membrane and water phases as well as membrane and gas phases in addition to the coupled heat and mass transfer occurring across the membrane. The model is then integrated along the length of a hollow fiber membrane humidifier in order to predict humidifier performance as a function of design variables, operating variables and operational strategies. For realistic values of membrane thickness and flow parameters, the model suggests that while membrane-gas interfacial resistance alone is crucial for heat transfer, the vapor transfer is governed by the combined resistances of diffusion within the membrane and membrane-gas interface. The model is validated against experimental data obtained using a commercial hollow fiber membrane module. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Colloid suspensions commonly exhibit a distribution of sizes, but most transport models only consider a single colloid size. A mathematical model was therefore developed to describe the advective and dispersive transport and first-order retention and release of a stable or aggregating polydispersed colloid suspension in porous media. The colloid size distribution was described using a unimodal or a bimodal lognormal probability density function (PDF), and Brownian aggregation was considered by making lognormal PDF parameters a function of time. Filtration theory was used to predict the retention rate coefficients for the various colloid sizes. The amount of retention for a stable polydispersed suspension was highly dependent on the colloid size distribution parameters, especially for a bimodal lognormal PDF. Increasing the distribution variance produced hyper-exponential retention profiles and an increase or a decrease in colloid retention depending on whether the medium colloid size was close to the optimum size for transport. Aggregation produced a similar decrease in the breakthrough concentrations with injection time as ripening, especially when the sticking efficiency was low. Aggregation effects were much more pronounced at higher input concentration levels, which also produced retention profiles that were increasingly hyper-exponential. Simulation results indicate that the colloid size distribution of stable and aggregating polydispersed suspensions always becomes more uniform and approaches the optimum transport size with increasing distance, suggesting that consideration of polydispersed suspensions is of primary importance near the injection surface.

AB A lattice Boltzmann discretization based numerical study has been carried out to study the effect of sudden contraction in a rectangular channel during uprise of a lighter liquid species inside a heavier one. Diffused interface concept has been adopted for the prediction of liquid-liquid interface. Simulations are performed for passage of a kerosene droplet through restrictions like a sudden contraction, orifice, and remotely spaced contraction-expansion. A wide range of contraction ratio, droplet volume, and channel inclinations are considered to study the evolution of interface along the rectangular conduit. Symmetric change of interfacial shape has been observed while droplet tries to accommodate in the narrow confined zone after contraction. Using streamlines and velocity vectors, the reasons behind the interfacial evolution are established. With a decrease in contraction ratio, resistance against droplet passage increases this produces lengthier lamella like kerosene interface in the downstream of contraction. Droplet volume showed a significant effect in constructing the tail interfacial structure, which allows water to penetrate inside kerosene core for larger volumes. During the passage of a kerosene droplet in a channel with different inclination, stage of an asymmetric interface is observed. By providing offset contraction, local asymmetries are observed in the kerosene interface near the plane of area reduction. Efforts are continued to observe the kerosene droplet passage through an orifice which showed restricted and free interfacial evolution after contraction and expansion sections, respectively. The stabilizing zone between contraction and expansion showed influence on the generation of daughter droplets by fragmenting kerosene interface. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB A volumetric equation of state (PVT behavior of a fluid) is often based on a critical isotherm. Soave-Redlich-Kwong and Peng-Robinson are by far the most popular cubic equations of state. These equations use the first and second differential conditions at the critical point to obtain the parameters but fail to reproduce the P-V-T behavior near the critical point. A new simple equation is proposed for the critical isotherm which matches experimental data for a variety of molecules in the entire range from critical point to ideal gas condition as well as the liquid region. The new proposed critical isotherm equation matches experimental data of a wide variety of compounds much better than these cubic equations of state employed commonly. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Computational fluid dynamics was applied for sorption enhanced steam methane reforming (SESMR) operating in a circulating fluidized bed (CFB) riser. The solid mixtures consisted of Ni-based catalyst and CaO sorbent. The aim of study was to design a proper pilot-scale CFB riser which produced hydrogen (H-2) with both high purity and high flux. The design parameters and the reaction parameters were examined with 2(k) full factorial design. The significances of each parameter were analyzed by analysis of variance. Using the optimum result, the highest H-2 purity reached 98.58% in dry basis accompanied with the highest H-2 flux of 0.301 kg/m(2) s. The hydrodynamics of this optimum case showed that SESMR was nearly completed since 5.0 m height because axial and radial distributions of solid were well developed without excessive segregation between catalyst and sorbent. Thus, the H-2 purity and the H-2 flux approached fully developed within the riser height. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB A novel mixing device (Soft Elastic Reactor - SER) that induces mixing by vibration of the tank wall is presented and characterized using dimensional analysis. This type of mixing system, which does not have an agitator inside the tank, is interesting for specific mixing applications, although it is still seldom used due to the lack of knowledge about how it works. First, the set of dimensionless numbers governing the mixing time of the SER was established. Then, the shapes of mixing curves and the onset of different mixing regimes as a function of the fluid property (i.e., viscosity) and operating conditions (i.e., penetration depth and vibration frequency) were experimentally obtained. Results showed that a constant number of beatings is required to achieve the desired degree of homogeneity under a laminar regime, while a sharp decrease in the number of strikes can be observed when the laminar regime is over. The shape of the mixing curves for the SER was compared to those of conventional mixers in which agitation is ensured by the revolution around a vertical axis of a centered agitator. Similarities between the mixing curves are discussed: it appears that regardless of the mixer type, the key parameter governing the desired degree of homogeneity is the number of excitation cycles, i.e., either the number of agitator revolutions for classical mixers or the number of strikes for the SER.

AB Fluidised beds are used in a variety of processes because of their favourable mass and heat transfer characteristics. In this and many other processes, non-spherical particles are commonplace, which can drastically affect the fluidisation behaviour. In this study, we use numerical models to study non-spherical fluidisation behaviour in detail. A crucial step in the development of the numerical model is a detailed validation with experimental data. The validated model can then be used with confidence for further investigations. In this study, the results obtained from CFD-DEM modelling are compared with detailed experiments (Mahajan et al., 2017). The particles used are of spherocylindrical shape with an aspect ratio 4. We discuss the numerical modelling strategy including the DEM contact detection algorithm and accurate voidage calculation algorithm. The non-spherical single particle drag model of Holzer and Sommerfeld (2008) is compared with a DNS drag model for spherocylindrical particles developed in-house. We propose two new voidage correction models and compare results with the (Di Felice, 1994) model. The pressure drop, bed height, particle orientation, particle circulation, stacking of particles and coordination number obtained from simulations are compared with experiments. The numerical measurements show good agreement with experiments. Similar to experiments, simulations show that rod-like particles are prone to interlocking behaviour. At high gas flow rates above the minimum fluidisation velocity, vigorously bubbling fluidisation is observed, with gas bubbles moving up through the center and particles moving down at the side walls. The orientation of particles in the fluidised state do not match with the experiments when hydrodynamic torque is neglected. The importance of hydrodynamic torque and multi-particle drag in CFD-DEM modelling of non-spherical particles is demonstrated through these results. (C) 2018 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB The accurate prediction of the drag force exerted by a fluid on assemblies of particles is critical to simulate key characteristics of gas-solid systems such as the bed expansion in fluidized beds. To this end, a lattice Boltzmann method has been applied to compute the drag force acting on assemblies of cubes for a wide range of Reynolds numbers, Re-v = 0-200, and solid volume fractions, phi = 0.1 - 0.45. The numerical data was used to propose a new drag force correlation for assemblies of cubes as a function of the Reynolds number and solid volume fraction. The new drag force correlation is expected to improve the accuracy of Euler-Euler and Euler-Lagrangian simulations of cubic particles. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB We design and implement a simple and versatile droplet-based millifluidic method for investigating nucleation and growth processes in crystal-forming aqueous systems. It consists in generating and storing in a transparent capillary a train of identical and regularly-spaced droplets of an aqueous phase in a carrier oil phase, and then in video-monitoring crystal nucleation and subsequent growth and melting events as temperature and/or pressure are varied. Compared to previous investigations, the novelty is the possibility of working with aqueous solutions containing dissolved gas under controlled pressure, thus opening the way to gas hydrate studies. In the absence of dissolved gas, i.e., at ambient pressure, we observe ice nucleation to be weakly promoted by titanium oxide and montmorillonite particles, and strongly promoted by silver iodide, in agreement with literature results. Ice nucleation is also promoted when the carrier oil is more wetting towards the capillary, which is the case for fluorinated oil as compared to n-hexane. With cyclopentane, a hydrate-former, as the carrier oil, and dissolved CO2, also a hydrate-former and a "help gas" for cyclopentane hydrate formation, we find evidence for hydrate nucleation along with that of ice, and monitor the different solid phases as temperature varies.

TI Results from a commercial-scale experimental validation of a

AB Conditioning of room air in summer is important globally. Many building however do not have an energy strategy predicated on quantitative unit-operations principles. To address this, a new probabilistic model was synthesised (Chem. Eng. Sci. XXX (2017) xxx-xxx) and a quantitative on-only strategy proposed to minimize electrical energy used. Here for the first time we report an extensive commercial-scale test of this strategy over 77 contiguous days of summer (Jan. to Mar.) in a large hotel (169 rooms) in S-E Australia (latitude -37.819708, longitude 144.959936) - a hot and dry clime. Two, dimensionally-identical suites (each of two rooms), with the same fit-out and (S-E) aspect, together with identical air conditioner (8.1 kW) and 'smart' (National Meter Identification) meters to automatically transmit contiguous (24-7) electrical use (at 30 min intervals) (n = 3696). Each suite (10.164 x 9.675 m floor plan) was auto-set to a bulk interior air temperature of 22 degrees C. In one (treated) the air conditioner was operated continuously (on-only), whilst in the other (control) it was left to wide-spread industry practice of switching on whilst the room is occupied, and off, when un-occupied (on-off). The suites had standard, single-glazed pane windows or curtain wall with heat-attenuating (fabric) internal curtains. Ambient peak temperature ranged from 17.8 to 39.1 degrees C. There were 32 days with recorded rainfall. Overall occupancy rate of both suites was almost identical at 69.6 and 71.2% respectively for the treated and control suite. This coincided with a typical business period for the hotel. Based on independent electrical energy invoices, results showed the treated suite used less energy on 47 days (61%) of the experimental period. Greenhouse gases were reduced by 12%. Savings in electrical energy cost of AUD $0.75 per day (9%), averaged over the period, were found for the treated suite adopting the alternative on-only strategy. Experimental findings overall therefore support the energy strategy hypothesis that continuous on only air conditioning will use less energy in summer. The hypothesis appears generalizable and could be adapted to a range of room geometries and seasons. Results will be of immediate interest to operators and managers of large public and commercial buildings that rely on conditioning of bulk dry air in summer.

AB In present work, a numerical study was carried out to investigate the non-isothermal slip flow over a micro spherical particle at low Reynolds numbers. The slip boundary conditions (non-equilibrium momentum exchange and heat transfer) were adopted in the numerical model to predict the discontinuity phenomena at the gas-particle interface. It shows that the drag force acting on the particle and the average Nusselt number on the particle surface both decrease as the Knudsen number increases, which are caused by the effects of velocity slip and temperature jump on the gas-particle interface, respectively. As the particle temperature increases, the drag coefficient increases due to the increasing gas viscosity and the average Nusselt number decreases as the heat conduction becomes dominant at low Reynolds numbers. The influence of gas compressibility on the flow and heat transfer processes were studied based on the numerical predictions, which should be considered for the non-isothermal gaseous flow in the slip regime even if the Mach number is smaller than 0.3. And the effect of gas variable properties cannot be neglected as the temperature difference exists between the particle and gaseous fluid. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB To cope with the difficulty of on-line quality prediction for multi-grade processes widely operated in process industries, a just-in-time latent variable modeling method is proposed based on extracting the common and special features of multi-grade processes. Considering the complicated nonlinear characteristics of multi-grade processes encountered in engineering applications, a just-in-time learning (JITL) strategy is developed to choose the relevant samples from different grades with respect to the query sample. A novel common feature extraction algorithm is proposed to determine the common directions shared by different grades of processes. After extracting the common features, a partial least-squares modeling algorithm is used to extract the special directions for each grade, respectively. Hence, product quality prediction can be simply conducted by integrating the common and special parts of each grade for model building in terms of a JITL strategy. A numerical case and an industrial polyethylene process are used to demonstrate the effectiveness and advantage of the proposed method. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The rotary kiln is an essential device in chemical and metallurgical industries, with applications in a wide range of solids manufacturing processes. In particular, in the preparation of industrial chemical catalysts, the kiln has become a popular reactor for continuous calcination of catalysts ranging from millimeter-sized extrudates to micron-sized powders. As granular and powder flow behaviors are difficult to characterize, the design and scale-up of rotary calcination processes are often performed empirically. The goal of this research is to improve the fundamental understanding of powder flow in rotary kilns to aid in optimization of the continuous calcination process. For successful calcination to occur, the residence time of the particles must exceed the time required for heating and subsequent treatment. For uniform treatment of the feed, the particles must also exhibit low axial dispersion. In this work, the mean residence time and axial dispersion coefficient for a cohesive fluid catalytic cracking powder were determined in a pilot plant kiln by measuring the residence time distribution. This study utilized a pulse test developed by Danckwerts. Results were fit to the Taylor solution of the axial dispersion model and compared to the Sullivan prediction for mean residence time. It was found that the mean residence time decreases as the feed rate, kiln incline, and rotation rate increase. It was also found that the axial dispersion coefficient increases with speed of rotation and angle of incline. However, the axial dispersion coefficient decreases as the feed rate is increased.

AB The main focus of the present work is to investigate the collision of two oblique cylindrical water jets through a series of experiments. Different regimes for the collision of water jets are illustrated and transitions to the fingering instability and subsequently to the violent flapping regime are discussed. The collision between high inertia and low viscous liquid jets is often used for generating liquid sheets which atomize to form droplets. They are mainly used in the combustion chambers of rocket engines involving liquid fuels having viscosity of the order similar to water. Further, inertia-based asymmetry is studied and an analytical method is proposed (L-1 error norm = 0.05) to understand the deflection observed in the plane of sheet formation. The resultant sheets formed are also compared with those generated by the collision of symmetric jets. The range of dimensionless numbers targeted in this study are within 10 <= We <= 1200, 1.5 <= Fr <= 18.5 and 1900 <= Re <= 20, 000. We have also illustrated the life cycle of a single sheet in the low inertial regime to form chain-like structures. At last, a different method of generation of multiple interconnected sheets is demonstrated through the distortion of a sheet by the impact of a liquid jet. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The dynamics of dust lifting behind a passing shock wave has been extensively studied in recent years. Nevertheless, only a few studies have focused on the problem of dust lifting by a rarefaction wave. Therefore, the first objective of this research was to create a three-dimensional computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model of experiments and simulations shown in literature. For this, the Eulerian-Eulerian approach was selected as the modelling technique. The second part of the research was devoted to performing own experiments, as well as their numerical simulations. The process of dust lifting was recorded using a high-speed camera in two pressure chambers with different diameters using a solenoid valve to initiate depressurization. It turned out that the particle layer showed similarities to a fluidized particle bed when exposed to the rarefaction wave. After the rarefaction wave arrived at the particle bed, the bed expanded upwards with visible bubbles forming and expanding inside, eventually breaking through the top of the bed and spouting dust further up the chamber. A combination of smaller particle diameter, smaller pressure chamber diameter and higher initial pressure gave the highest amount of particle dispersion. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Separation selectivity of the mixture yttrium-neodymium-dysprosium using bis (2-ethylhexyl) hydrogen phosphate (D2EHPA) as extractant in a flat sheet supported liquid membrane was studied by simulations. A new definition of selectivity and a diffusional-kinetic transient model were used in the calculations. Resistance distribution between the phases, stripping phase pH, extractant concentration and initial feed concentration have great influence on selectivity and process time and their appropriate management would improve separation. The analysis of selectivity using the present model would be a useful tool to design a multistage process aimed at the separation of a multicomponent mixture of rare earth elements into its constituents.

AB Direct propylene epoxidation is an important gas-phase reaction for the future industrial production of propylene oxide (PO). However, the mechanistic understanding of this reaction system is still elusive, including the role of side reactions. Herein, kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) simulations are applied to explore the underlying mechanistic aspects of propylene epoxidation over Au/TiO2/SiO2, and consistent results are obtained with respect to experimental benchmarks. The present study systematically probes the reaction mechanism, which involves acrolein formation on Au nanoparticles as well as the formation of PO and several byproducts at the Au/Ti dual interface sites, and it highlights the synergistic effect of interface sites in heterogeneous catalysis. The origin of the negative effect of rising reaction temperature on PO selectivity has been clarified, as it is correlated with decreasing atomic oxygen coverage on the Au surface. The varying feed concentration of H-2/O-2/C3H6 leads to different coverages on the catalyst surface, emphasizing the importance of an optimum H-2/C3H6 inlet concentration ratio for enhancing PO selectivity and hydrogen utilization efficiency. Based on our model results, we propose that supports with acidic groups may promote hydroperoxy species transferring to the adjacent Ti sites, thereby decreasing its decomposition to atomic oxygen on the Au sites, which leads to byproduct formation.

AB To consider the effect of cross diffusion more rigorously, the onset and the growth of the gravitational instabilities in a Hele-Shaw cell saturated with ternary solution are analyzed by considering all cross diffusion coefficients. Through the asymptotic analysis, we identify the double-diffusive (DD)-, diffusive-layer convection (DLC)- and extended double diffusive (EDD)-type instability regimes. To support the asymptotic stability analysis, new linear stability equations are derived in the global domain and then transformed into the similar domain. In the similar domain, we prove that initially the system is unconditionally stable. For transient stability analysis, the linear stability equations are solved by employing quasi-steady state approximations (QSSA's). To avoid the limit of the conventional QSSAz, we obtain the critical time for the onset of instability motion using the QSSA in the similar domain (QSSA zeta). (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Coupled with detailed catalytic reaction mechanism, the exhaust reforming process in a fixed bed reactor was simulated using a porous media model to investigate the reforming characteristics under different initial conditions. The effects of gas hourly space velocity (GHSV), feed component, steam addition and wall temperature on the methane conversion rate, hydrogen yield and other characteristic parameters were analyzed. The simulation results show that the oxygen is consumed rapidly when the reforming gas enters the reaction zone and the steam reforming plays a dominant role in the latter part. The exhaust reforming process mainly involves oxidation reaction, steam reforming reaction and water gas shift reaction. The methane conversion and hydrogen production decrease with the rise of GHSV, while the molar ratio of H-2 to CO first increases and then decreases and reaches its peak value when GHSV ranges from 30,000 h (1) to 35,000 h (1). As the ratio of methane to exhaust increases, a higher molar fraction of hydrogen at the outlet can be achieved owing to a bigger proportion of partial reforming reaction of methane, and methane conversion rate decreases. It also suggests that a modest steam addition is preferable for both the reforming performance and the life span of the fixed bed. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Particle processing industries, such as pharmaceutical, food processing and consumer goods sectors, increasingly require strategies to control and engineer particle attributes. In both traditional batch and continuous processes, particle size and shape need to be effectively monitored through in-line measurements from Process Analytical Technologies. However, obtaining quantitative information from these measurements has proven to be challenging and in-line imaging techniques are primarily used for qualitative purposes. Two key challenges are: (1) the presence of out-of-focus objects and (2) images only represent 2D projections of three-dimensional objects. In this work, a novel framework to process frames from in-line imaging probes incorporates a focus evaluation step in order to extract meaningful quantitative shape and size information through rejection of out-of-focus particles. Furthermore, a model is proposed that simulates the 2D projection of three-dimensional particles onto the focal plane and computes the corresponding size and shape distributions. The framework is quantified and evaluated against standard particles of well-defined size and shape such as polystyrene microspheres and needle-like cuboid silicon particles. (C) 2018 The Authors.

AB Biopharmaceutical processes should be designed to maximize productivity and ensure product quality. What is underestimated in this context is the variability of the raw material. Especially complex raw materials are challenging to characterize, hence, the identification of crucial raw material attributes that influence productivity or product quality is troublesome. In this study metabolic flux analysis (MFA) is applied to fill the gap between raw material characterization and process understanding. The approach is demonstrated in corn steep liquor (CSL) and a Penicillium chrysogenum process. This bioprocess is already well understood and there exist various MFA models aiming at understanding the fungal metabolism and production pathways. However, MFA was as per our knowledge not used for the identification of critical raw material attributes. Hence, in this study an MFA model was adapted from literature including CSL related fluxes and CSL release kinetics. The application of a sensitivity analysis with respect to qpen and mu revealed the potential of the model based approach: we identified methionine as a key attribute in CSL for penicillin production. As a consequence, an optimized process could be presented by reducing CSL in the media and pulsing methionine, which resulted in a duplication of product titer.
   In summary, the expansion of an MFA model with raw material characteristics featured by the application of sensitivity analysis is a promising approach for science-based decisions on crucial raw material attributes. It could facilitate the predictive design of complex raw materials along Quality by Design rationales as well as model-based process improvement with respect to raw material attributes. Additionally, the method allows the identification of raw material variability and the impact of these variances on the process. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The first non-Onsager thermodynamic invariant for a non-linear chemical system was found experimentally in all domains using "the dual kinetic experiment" in a batch reactor in which the reaction of esterification of ethanol with acetic acid was studied jointly with the reaction of hydrolysis of ethyl acetate. In a typical experiment, a glass flask was loaded with 200 mL of 1 mol/L ethanol and acetic acid in acetonitrile for esterification or 1 mol/L ethyl acetate and water in acetonitrile for hydrolysis at 20, 30, and 40 degrees C. The obtained experimental result is a justification of the theory presented previously (Constales et al., 2012). (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

   autologous chemotaxis

ID PHYSICAL CUES; MICROENVIRONMENT; INVASION; TISSUE
AB It has been demonstrated that interstitial fluid (IF) flow can play a crucial role in tumor cell progression. In the seminal works by Swartz and collaborators (Fleury et al., 2006; Shields et al., 2007) it was discovered that due to this flow, chemokine ligands secreted by tumor cells selectively tend to bind to receptors (CCR7) on the downstream side of the cells that in turn stimulate cells to migrate in the direction of the flow. This migration process was denoted as autologous chemotaxis. Previous mathematical modeling of autologous chemotaxis apparently has been restricted to single-phase considerations. The purpose of this work is to explore how a multiphase approach can be used where the fluid and cancer cells are treated as two separate phases with their own momentum balance equations. A mathematical model is derived that sheds light on essential nonlinear coupling mechanisms and interactions that are involved. The role played by fluid-ECM (friction type of term) and cell-ECM interaction forces (adhesion forces) are demonstrated. In particular, a fluid generated stress term in the mathematical expression for the cell velocity is highlighted. This term reflects how the flowing fluid will try to push the cancer cells in the downstream direction whose effect must be counterbalanced by the cancer cells by creating a sufficiently strong cell-ECM resistance force. Moreover, in order to represent the autologous chemotaxis migration mechanism we include (i) a component to represent stagnant ECM concentration (collagen); (ii) a chemical component representing chemokine that can convect with the fluid; and (iii) a third chemical component to represent protease secreted by the cancer cells which is able to release ECM-bound chemokine through proteolytic activity. The resulting model allows us to demonstrate how the autologous chemotaxis transport mechanism is governed by formation of chemokine concentration gradients that are asymmetric and skewed in the flow direction. We test the model behavior for a flow system with an external imposed pressure gradient which is comparable with the laboratory experiments by Swartz and collaborators. Sensitivity to changes in circumstances like blocking of the CCR7 receptor needed for autologous chemotaxis and elimination of the pressure driven IF flow (i.e., no flow) are explored and discussed. We also illustrate the model behavior in an envisioned tumor setting where increased IF flow is produced from leaky blood vessels that sit on the inside of the tumor. An increased fluid flow towards the region on the outside of the tumor is then generated where it is adsorbed by lymphatic vessels and gives rise to a characteristic elevated IF pressure profile that decreases at the tumor periphery. In turn, this results in an autologous chemotactic driven migration of cancer cells at the rim of the tumor. The simulation illustrates how the autologous chemotactic cell migration mechanism discovered by Swartz and collaborators possibly can be used as a means for metastasis by generating aggressive cell migration towards lymphatic vessels.

AB Solids suspension in a stirred tank with a down-pumping pitched-blade turbine impeller has been investigated by using particle image velocimetry (PIV) experiments as well as direct numerical simulations (DNS) with a lattice-Boltzmann (LB) method. The flow regime of this solid-liquid two-phase system is transitional with the impeller-based Reynolds numbers Re = 1334. The refractive index matching (RIM) method is applied in the experiments. The overall solids volume fractions are up to 8% in the experiments as well as in the simulations. The liquid flow fields around the particles are highly resolved in both experimental and simulated cases which makes it possible to investigate solid-liquid interactions in detail. The average distributions of the solids over the tank volume as predicted by the simulations are in good agreement with the experimental results. It is shown that the presence of particles reduces the average velocities as well as the turbulent fluctuation levels of the liquid in both the experiments and simulations although the reduction in the simulations is weaker as compared to in the experiments.

AB Recent research on unlocking the solvent dispersion as a physical blending process in porous media has been mainly focused on core-scale observations. Pore-level studies of multiphase displacements can help to develop models that correlate rock macro-scale characteristics with its small-scale features, particularly for unsaturated rocks where the intricate fluid arrangements cause dynamic events to be localized in preferential pathways. In this work, to draw new insights into the physics of pore-level interfaces and crystallize the role of small-scale phenomena on the efficiency of solvent-aided bitumen recovery processes, numerical simulations coupled with experiments are conducted in pore-level domains. We simulate fluid flow and transport phenomena through millimeter-sized three-dimensional slabs of consolidated and unconsolidated packings of grains representing the geological rock types of the McMurray formation. We propose a robust numerical workflow for simulation of miscible-floods in unsaturated porous media and investigate the impact of matrix heterogeneity, connate water, cementation, and injection velocity on the longitudinal dispersion coefficient. In particular, primary drainage is simulated at low capillary numbers resulting in two-phase fluid occupancies through pore space domains. Finite element simulations are then carried out in order to solve the mixing advection-diffusion equations within the water-free pore space, and lastly, the effluent history is analyzed to predict the dispersion coefficient in both fully- and partially-saturated conditions and evaluate the efficiency of miscible displacements in the presence of microheterogeneities. A new analytical model for calculation of dispersivity, together with the numerical simulation results, is utilized to adjust a general model for the prediction of longitudinal dispersion coefficient in unsaturated sandy porous media of either uniform or non-uniform grains. Moreover, miscible-flood experiments at low to high injection velocities are conducted in a transparent glass micromodel. According to the results, rock micro-heterogeneities and immobile water both increase the longitudinal dispersion coefficient, and two-phase equilibria control the velocity field by creating connected regions of brine and low resistance oil-filled channels and consequently influence the solute transport and mixing processes. The effect of viscosity contrast on the longitudinal dispersion coefficient is also noteworthy, as the viscous fingering at unfavorable viscosity ratios widens the mixing zone. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB This paper presents a new model for predicting the evolution of the particle size of gold nanoparticles (GNPs) in the citrate synthesis method. In this method, the precursor is an acid solution of tetrachloroauric acid, while the reducing agent is a base solution of sodium citrate. The acid-base properties of the solutions influence how the size of the particles evolves during the synthesis. In the literature, various mechanistic theories have been proposed to explain this evolution. Turkevich et al. (1951), who pioneered this synthesis method, suggested the "organizer theory". This mechanistic description of the synthesis was modelled by Kumar et al. (2007), but recently Agunloye et al. (2017) showed that in several cases this model performed poorly, since it does not account for the acid-base properties of the reactants. In this work, we present a kinetic model based on the synthesis seed-mediated mechanistic description proposed by Wuithschick et al. (2015). In this description, the precursor concurrently reduces into gold atoms and hydroxylates into a passive form. The gold atoms then aggregate into seed particles, which finally react with the passive form of the precursor in a growth step. We validated the model using experimental data from the literature obtained for conditions in which the seed-mediated mechanism is valid. The predicted GNP final sizes closely agree with those obtained experimentally. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Though having been studied for more than four decades, photocatalysis is still hardly applied in large-scale water and wastewater treatment. This is mainly due to the low energy efficiency of conventional photocatalytic reactors. A recently introduced reactor concept, the fixed-bed photocatalytic membrane reactor (FPMR), can potentially overcome this shortcoming. Its performance for the degradation of organic compounds is examined for different modes of operation. For this purpose, FPMRs based on commercial submerged ceramic membranes were used, which are covered by a photocatalytic layer of pyrogenic titania. The FPMRs were performed in two operational modes: closed-loop reactor and continuous-flow reactor. Oxalic acid was used as a model organic compound to conduct photocatalysis. The influence of light intensity and catalyst layer thickness as well as mass transfer inside the layer were thoroughly studied. The evaluation of the reactors was based on the apparent quantum yield, the photocatalytic space-time yield and specific energy consumption. The results demonstrate that the FPMRs are considerably more efficient than other reported reactor concepts. Its apparent quantum yield can reach up to 11.1%. Furthermore, its specific light energy consumption is merely around 0.1 kWh/g (TOC). The results also reveal that closed-loop FPMRs achieve higher efficiencies than continuous-flow FPMRs. Last but not least, a quantitative model for calculating the reaction rate constant of a photocatalytic membrane from observed reaction rate constant of a photocatalytic membrane reactor was developed and experimentally verified.

AB We perform a theoretical study on transient reaction-diffusion kinetics in an electrokinetic Y-shaped microreactor. The flow is assumed to be both steady and fully developed. The governing equations are solved in dimensionless form utilizing a 3D finite-volume-based numerical algorithm, assuming a second-order irreversible reaction between the components. Analytical solutions are also obtained for cross-stream diffusion without reaction under a uniform velocity distribution. It is shown that the well-known butterfly-shaped form of the product concentration profile is not immediately created and it is established only after the system is sufficiently close to its steady-state. Furthermore, the inclination of the concentration peak toward the component of lower diffusivity or inlet concentration is less significant at the earlier stages of the production. Finally, it is demonstrated that the short-term influence of the parameters affecting the advection of mass on the total efficiency, defined as the ratio of the total production to the amount of the limiting reactant within the device, is quite the opposite of that at the steady-state.

AB Networks of microdevices can be used to form, sort, split and recombine droplets by varying the fluidic resistance of the channels. To facilitate design of such systems we propose two models to calculate pressure drop of liquid-liquid slug flow in square microchannels. By approximating a droplet surrounded by liquid film as annular flow, the moving film model includes the velocity profile in the lubricating layer. In the no-film model, the presence of liquid film is neglected. Pressure drop measurements of water-toluene and water-silicone oil slug flow generated in glass/silicon devices of 200 and 400 mu m width serve to validate these two models. We found that the droplet viscosity influences the applicability of the models. Good agreement is obtained for water-toluene slug flow, with the average error of 15-20% between the measured and calculated values for both models, proving that the presence of the lubricating film may be neglected for flows with similar viscosities of both phases. On the contrary, both predictions agree poorly with experiments for silicon oil-water flow which we attribute to the lower than expected liquid film thickness around the silicon oil droplets. Therefore we use the moving film model to estimate the thickness of the lubricating layer which we find to lie between 0.5% and 0.75% of the channel width, lower than the assumed 2%. Finally we compare the performance of our models against two correlations adapted from literature. We thus demonstrate that our approach allows reliable pressure drop prediction for liquids with similar viscosities and delivers important information on flow hydrodynamics. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB In this paper, the exact numerical solution for the enhancement factor for mass transfer accompanied by an irreversible second-order reaction based on the film theory is presented. The accuracy of the numerical solution is enhanced by using non-uniform discretization steps and Richardson extrapolation. Approximate analytical solutions available in the literature for the enhancement factor for an irreversible second-order reaction were compared with presented numerical solution. All approximate solutions are able to predict the values of the enhancement factor with the relative deviations within 10% compared to the exact numerical solution for the film theory. However, the applicability of the model and some approximate solutions is limited to the fast reaction regime. The approximate solution of DeCoursey(1974), originally developed for the surface renewal theory, was adapted to the film theory by using a correction factor. The maximum relative deviation of the modified approximate solution is as low as 2.2% for entire range of parameters Ha and E-i (Hatta number and enhancement factor for instantaneous reaction), which is the best accuracy that has ever been reported for an explicit expression for the enhancement factor for an irreversible second-order reaction.

AB Many different procedures to design mixers have been investigated in research literature. The methods are either typically based on empiricism or already available mixers are scaled to adjust them to different but similar operating conditions, as considered in the original design process. For the most part the power characteristics of such a design of mixer has been proven through empirical methods, or is estimated within the mentioned scale-up methodology. The estimation of the power consumption has been shown as especially prone to error. The practice of estimation is associated with uncertainties, due to the determination of the power consumption in a late step of the design technique, or just simply has a low reliability. In this paper, a method will be derived in order to predict the full power characteristic without performing any experimental investigations within the design process. A new blade element momentum theory based design method will be taken and enhanced to calculate the power consumption by actually inverting the entire design procedure. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The major contaminant targeted during the treatment of the oilfield produced water is dispersed oil. The efficiency of most separation processes highly relies on the size of the droplets, which can be increased through coalescence. Crude oil has a complex and field-dependent composition, which can affect the interfacial properties of the drops, and consequently the merging process in different ways. This study focused on the development of microfluidic techniques for investigating coalescence between crude oil drops. The experiments were performed with six diluted crude oils and three neat oils, the latter in the presence of an oil-soluble surfactant. The composition of the water phase was systematically varied (pH, ionic composition, presence of dissolved components). In general, crude oil droplets coalesced more readily in lower or neutral pH. The addition of dissolved Fluka acids to the water phase had a unique effect on each crude oil, reflecting their composition. What is more, this effect was similar to the presence of water-soluble crude oil components in the aqueous phase. The pressure did not have a significant effect on the coalescence, which was explained by the lack of the lightest components (C1-C4) in the system. In summary, the results revealed several trends, however it was clear that the coalescence highly depended on the oil composition. This underlined the necessity for experimental methods, such as microfluidics, which allow for quick assessment of the stability of crude oil droplets. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB For efficient bioprocess control it is essential to use advanced model based control strategies. Various models and control algorithms with different behaviour and peculiarities exist. The goal of this study was to compare the performance of two different model-based control strategies with respect to simultaneous set-point control of two individual substrate uptake rates (namely specific glucose and specific lactose uptake rates) by two substrate feeds within an E. coli fed-batch process. The compared controllers were an already established controller based on elemental balances (EBC), which was adapted for two feeds, and a model predictive controller (MPC) based on a mechanistic model, which was developed and configured for this study. MPC and EBC were compared systematically with a simulation and an experimental study. Both showed a comparable behaviour and were generally capable to fulfil their tasks. The MPC was based on a better and more flexible description of the system, whereas the EBC was easier and showed a more stable behaviour. Both suffered in case of wrongly estimated initial biomass. Summed up, for the described situation the EBC was preferable due to its simplicity. However, the potential of the MPC is clearly in its prediction power and flexibility towards objective functions. Therefore, it would be the controller of choice in case of product-related objective functions. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) was used to investigate the film flow on rotating wheel for a horizontal twin-shaft reactor. The Volume of Fluid (VOF) model combined with the sliding mesh method was chosen to simulate the film formation process. The mechanism on a rotating wheel distinguishes itself from that on a regular solid disk. Bounded film with only one gas-liquid interface and unbounded film with two gas-liquid interfaces coexist due to the presence of an open window under certain operation conditions. The unbounded film inside open window is significantly thinner and returns more rapidly to the liquid pool. The minimum rotating speed for unbounded film formation decreases when the liquid viscosity increases. The open window on the rotating wheel can enhance the film flow and surface renewal, due to the interaction and transition between the unbounded film inside the open window zone and the bounded film on the ring and spoke zones, but this intensification is limited for highly viscous polymers.

AB Forced surface segregation incorporated into non-solvent induced phase separation (NIPS) process for the preparation of the tri-block copolymer homoporous membrane was investigated by dissipative particle dynamics simulations. The copolymer bears hydrophobic cellulose acetate (CA), hydrophilic poly(poly (ethylene glycol) methyl ether methacrylate) (PEGMA) and low surface energy poly(hexafluorobutyl methacrylate) (PHFBM) segments. Simulation results show that the homoporous membrane can only be formed at the polymer concentration range of 15-40%. The analysis of the segment distribution of the membrane shows phase separation under different PHFBM/PEGMA block ratios. The introduction of PEGMA segments promoted the migration of low surface energy PHFBM segments to the surface of the membrane. By adjusting the mixing ratio of CA-PHFBM-PEGMA with CA from 0 to 60%, the controlled morphology regulation of the membrane can be realized. This work can serve as a guide and reference for the homoporous polymer membrane preparation via NIPS. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Microfluidic synthesis allows for a good control of the particle formation conditions while minimizing the consumption of material. In this study, we exploited these advantages for the nonaqueous synthesis of TiO2, ZnO and CeO2 nanoparticles in a closed micro droplet reactor which resulted in well-defined particle structures. Monodisperse droplets are generated in amicrofluidic flow-focusing area and subsequently transported to a reaction zone allowing synthesis temperatures of up to 200 degrees C. In addition, we showed that a continuous particle generation process using solid precursor species can be realized without channel clogging. We present different microfluidic designs with reaction zones consisting either of a long meandering channel or a short expansion channel to realize the different reaction times required for the respective model systems. Interestingly, we found that at elevated temperatures, the reaction mixture diffuses into the surrounding continuous phase fluid which leads to a shrinkage of the droplets, forcing eventually the assembly of highly spherical aggregate structures. Depending on the different model systems, we obtained nanospheres of about 100 nm from the CeO2 synthesis and microspheres up to 17 mu m in size from the TiO2 synthesis. In contrast, ZnO syntheses at milder temperatures were conducted without any droplet shrinkage which resulted in randomly shaped aggregates of 150 nm that self-assembled in the droplet micro reactor. Thus, a versatile synthesis technique is presented that can be applied for various metal oxides over a broad range of reaction parameters, as a promising approach for the controlled production of high quality nanoparticles.

AB Immersed boundary method (IBM) based CFD code has helped considerably in avoiding the tedious grid generation process in fluid flows involving complex geometries. In this work, we have developed an IBM framework to simulate flow, convective heat transfer as-well-as conjugate heat transfer through a highly complex random porous structure. In this framework, we can incorporate any complex solid body as a triangulated surface mesh and an accurate algorithm is proposed to identify solid cells and fluid cells. Moreover, a detailed implementation of periodic boundary condition for velocity and temperature is presented. Detailed code verification process is performed to demonstrate that the method is second-order accurate for both the velocity and temperature fields for all the boundary conditions considered.

ID DESIGN; SELECTION; FRAMEWORK
AB Module-based plant design opens up the opportunity for the (bio-)chemical industry to reduce lead times, which is crucial for future competitiveness. Equipment modules are designed once such that they can cover a wide range of process tasks and conditions. The time-consuming equipment design step is replaced by selecting the most suitable equipment module from an equipment module database so that engineering work is reused. It is the aim of this work to develop a structured approach for the determination of features to characterize industrial process tasks. On the one hand, these characteristic features determined are required for the generation of an equipment module database based on cluster analysis of industrial process tasks (Eilermann et al., 2017). On the other hand, the characteristic features are a measure for similarity of process tasks and support the selection of the same equipment module for similar tasks. Thereby, reuse of engineering is enabled. The approach for the determination of characteristic features presented is based on those used in data mining, whereas the quality of the characteristic features is traded off against the computational effort required. The approach developed is exemplarily applied to industrial liquid/liquid heat exchanger and condenser tasks kindly provided by Evonik. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In this study, the spreading of a liquid droplet on the surface of a fibrous paper and its penetration into the paper is studied. The spreading of the droplet was visualized using confocal microscopy and the penetration depth was quantified using Automatic Scanning Absorptiometry (ASA) measurements. The three-dimensional structure of the paper was obtained through micro-tomography imaging with a resolution of 0.9 mu m. The obtained images were used to reconstruct the pore space, which was in turn used in direct numerical simulations of penetration of a droplet into paper. Simulations were performed using open source code OpenFOAM, which solves equations of two-phase flow (in our case air and water) in pores based on the Volume of Fluid Method. Simulation results showed a good agreement with the experimental observations. In particular, the dimensions of spreading area of a droplet and the depth of penetration were simulated reasonably well. Then, we used the model to investigate effects of changes in various liquid properties on spreading and penetration of a droplet liquid. We made calculations for three different values of contact angle (CA): 0 degrees, 60 degrees, and 120 degrees. We found the largest penetration depth for CA = 0. For CA = 60 and CA = 120, we found that the liquid droplet moved sideways from the jetted location, which is not favorable in inkjet printing. We also made simulations with larger values for viscosity and density, based on properties of an ink-based liquid used in inkjet printing. The results have shown a slower spreading and penetration compared with water. The model can be used to study effects of changes in either ink physical properties or paper layer microstructure on final spreading/penetration extent. (C) 2018 The Authors.

AB In this work, a 1D model of an entrained-flow carbonator of a Calcium looping process for cement plants is presented and the results of a sensitivity analysis on the main governing process parameters is discussed. Several design and operating parameters have been investigated through a wide sensitivity analysis, namely: adiabatic vs. cooled reactor, high gas velocity gooseneck reactor vs. low velocity down-flow reactor, solid-to-gas ratio, sorbent capacity, reactor inlet temperature and solids recirculation. The effect of these design and process parameters on the CO2 capture efficiency and on Calcium looping process heat consumption is assessed.
   The results of the calculations showed that with a proper combination of solid-to-gas ratio in the carbonator and sorbent carbonation capacity (e.g. similar to 10 kg/Nm(3) and similar to 20% respectively), carbonator CO2 capture efficiencies of about 80% (i.e. total cement kiln CO2 capture efficiencies higher than 90%) can be obtained in a gooseneck-type carbonator with a length compatible with industrial applications in cement kilns (similar to 120 to 140 m). Further experimental investigations on this reactor concept, especially about fluid-dynamic behavior and the chemical properties of raw meal as CO2 sorbent, are needed to demonstrate the technical feasibility of the proposed process.

AB Accurate prediction of the local liquid volume fraction (epsilon(L)) distribution, an important process parameter that governs the performance of Trickle Bed Reactors (TBRs), is still a challenge. In the present work, Eulerian multi-fluid simulations of local epsilon(L) distribution were performed in a laboratory-scale pseudo-3D (rectangular) and cylindrical TBR and the predictions were compared with the Electrical Resistance Tomography (ERT) measurements of Singh et al. (2017). The effect of formulation of capillary pressure force ((F) over bar (C)) was investigated and it was found that -P-C Delta epsilon(L) definition of P-C preserved the functional relation between the capillary pressure (P-C) and epsilon(L), and that epsilon(L)Delta P-C definition of (F) over bar (C) reversed the same. Through the simulations performed for the pseudo-3D column, we showed that the alteration in the functional relation severely affects the ability of (F) over bar (C) = ELVPc definition to predict the effects of particle diameter, gas and liquid flow rates. It was elucidated that such an alteration underpredicts (F) over bar (C) and could necessitate the inclusion of additional dispersion forces for particles with small diameters. (F) over bar (C) implemented as -P-C Delta epsilon(L) provided satisfactory predictions of the steady-state local epsilon(L) distribution for the bed pre-wetted with the pseudo-Kan pre-wetting method. However, the P-C model required an empirical correction ([(d(P)/d(thr))(epsilon(S))(0.6)](-13.957)) to predict the steady-state local epsilon(L) distribution in the bed pre-wetted using the Levec method. While the modified (F) over bar (C) predicted the time-averaged local epsilon(L) distribution satisfactorily for different liquid flow rates and liquid distributor configurations, it was seen that further reduction in (F) over bar (C) was required to predict the dynamic liquid spreading behavior under synthetically created pulsing flow conditions.

AB In many industrial processes, electrostatic charges are inevitable and affect the hydrodynamic behavior and heat transfer ability of chemical equipment. A comprehensive study of the electrostatic effect on bubble behavior, particle fluctuation velocity and heat transfer coefficient in the fluidized bed with a central jet has been evaluated in this paper by Eulerian-Eulerian two-fluid model coupled with electrostatic model and energy model. The simulated voidage profiles at different positions, bubble detachment time and initial bubble diameter are compared with experimental results from the literature without charge. The bubble behaviors including bubble frequency and bubble numbers, combined with particle fluctuation parameters are analyzed in both charged and uncharged system. The electrostatic effect on two kinds of heat transfer coefficients is quantitatively compared, namely bubble to emulsion phase heat transfers based on the gas throughflow velocity and gas-solid local heat transfer coefficient. Simulation results show that electrostatic charges decrease bubble numbers and granular temperature, whereas the averaged heat transfer coefficients are enhanced. Overall, the electrostatic effect on the hydrodynamic and heat transfer characteristics can be revealed. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Given the demand for clean gasoline with ultralow sulfur and olefin contents, reduced olefin content, which inevitably results in a large octane number loss, is urgently needed. The key to finding a solution for octane number loss is to identify the relationship between olefin hydrogenation and the loss of octane number of gasoline. The negative effect of certain olefins on octane number was first investigated by setting different olefins saturated in the same amount. C5-C7 olefins exhibit the most adverse effect on octane number than others. In addition, the saturation amounts of various olefins were also studied by fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) gasoline hydrogenation experiment. Given the negative effect and saturation amount, the sequence of octane number loss based on olefin hydrogenation is C5 approximate to C6 > C7 > C8 > C9 > C10, wherein C5-C7 olefins, which present high saturation amounts in the hydrogenation experiment, are the main contributing factors of octane number loss in gasoline hydrogenation. Based on the above studies, the formula of the loss of octane number was developed, which can estimate the loss of octane number of gasoline with the error range of less than 0.5 units Research Octane Number.

AB This work reports a cheap and easy-to-use droplet-based microfluidic platform for the study of protein crystallization, offering the possibility to characterize the protein phase behaviour, and the effect of volumetric and interfacial phenomena on the crystallization mechanism. We conducted a parametric study supported by comparison with literature data, to quantify the influence of the droplet volume on the thermodynamic (solubility data) and kinetic (metastability data) parameters, using lysozyme as a model protein. Experiments were performed in a tubular microreactor at low Capillary numbers (4.1 x 10(-5)-2.3 x 10(-4)), resulting in a broad range of droplet sizes. The droplet formation in a flowfocusing geometry was also numerically studied using CFD and a correlation for the droplet size was developed. Subsequently, the lysozyme phase behaviour and the possible mechanisms associated with the nucleation process were evaluated. While crystallization in small volume droplets is usually characterized by a low nucleation probability and correspondingly low number of crystals, we did not observe this in our experiments. A potential explanation for this is the complex and stochastic mechanism of nucleation, including the competition between monomers and oligomers in solution. (C) 2018 The Authors.

AB Microsecond molecular dynamics simulations were performed to investigate the methane hydrate formation on smooth and rough metal surface covered with water, light oil, and heavy oil with asphaltenes, respectively. The growth and crystallization of methane hydrates were characterized by the four-body order parameter and the face-saturated incomplete cage analysis. Results highlighted the priority for hydrate growth inside the groove of rough metal surface, from which the hydrate grew upwards to the outside of the groove and then to the water-gas interface. It clearly demonstrated the inhibition effects of light oil on the methane hydrate growth, which was further enhanced by adding asphaltenes. The inhibition mechanisms were elaborated during different stages of hydrate growth by gaining insights into the four-body order parameters at different locations of metal surface. To our knowledge, this was the first molecular-level study on the methane hydrate evolution on metal surface with heavy oil. It provided theoretical supports for evaluating the priority sites for the hydrate formation on pipe wall with concave and convex surfaces that might result from metal corrosion, change of pipe diameter or depositions of solid particles during the multi-phase transportation.

AB Bicyclic and multi-cyclic hydrocarbons usually have high density over 0.87 g/cm(3), which is very popular to synthesize from biomass-derived renewable chemicals, but their cryogenic properties need to be further improved for practical applications. In this work, we synthesized ethyl-substituted bicyclic high-performance hydrocarbons with improved cryogenic properties from the biomass-derived 4-ethylphenol and phenylmethaol. For the alkylation reaction between 4-ethylphenol with phenylmethanol, the reaction conditions were optimized, under which the conversion of phenylmethanol can achieve 100% with monoalkylated products (2-benzyl-4-ethylphenol and 3-benzyl-4-ethylphenol) selectivity of 71%. After hydrodeoxygenation catalyzed by a mixture catalyst of Pd/C and HZSM-5, the alkylation products were mainly converted to the ethyl-substituted dicyclohexylmethane. The obtained fuel shows a high density of 0.873 g/cm(3) (20 degrees C), gravimetric net heat of combustion of 42.7 MJ/kg, and the freezing point of -42 degrees C, which is promising to serve as a blend component for jet fuel application.

AB The electrocoalescence behavior of surfactant-laden droplet pairs in oil under a DC electric field was investigated in this paper. The characteristic parameters such as coalescence time, liquid bridge diameter and contact angle were analyzed for varying surfactant concentrations and electric capillary numbers. The results show that the horizontal electrocoalescence of two identical droplets with the same physical properties is symmetrical. Moreover, the surfactant has a significant influence on the pressure difference at the liquid bridge, which results in a variation of the liquid bridge growth and coalescence time. The pressure difference between the droplet and the liquid bridge is significantly dependent on the initial contact angle, which is determined by the electric capillary number Ca and surfactant concentration. The theoretical analysis and experimental results show that the large initial contact angle restrains the growth of the liquid bridge in the initial coalescence stage. Considering the effect of the initial contact angle, a characteristic time is proposed to describe the evolution of the liquid bridge. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Mass transfer phenomena in gas-solid fluidized beds with horizontally immersed membrane tube banks in different configurations were investigated using a Two-Fluid Model, considering the case of a binary hydrogen/nitrogen gas mixture fed to a 2D fluidized bed where hydrogen was extracted via hydrogen permselective membranes. The simulations showed that the hydrogen flux is strongly non-uniform over the radius of the membranes. The hydrogen flux is lowest on top of the membranes and highest at the bottom of the membranes, which is caused by the formation of densified zones on top of the membranes and the fact that the membranes shield their own top side from hydrogen replenishment. Also, in systems with membrane tube banks, the performance of individual membranes differs significantly. The membranes located near the bed walls perform considerably worse, because of downwards solids flow near the walls, resulting in more densified zones and gas back-mixing. The average hydrogen recovery per membrane is highest for the cases with a staggered tube bank configuration and without membranes positioned close to the bed walls. In-line tube bank configurations suffer from gas channeling, reducing the hydrogen recovery per membrane. The membrane tube banks also significantly improve the bed hydrodynamics by enhanced bubble-breakage, decreasing the bubble size to approximately the membrane pitch. (C) 2018 The Authors.

AB A novel column internal is proposed, named the tridimensional rotational flow sieve tray (TRST), which has a three-dimensional hollow structure that can make the gas form two kinds of flow pattern coupled with each other: one is rotational flow and the other is flow through the perforations. Using an air-liquid system, we experimentally measured the pressure drops (dry and wet) when gas-liquid flows concurrently downwards through the TRST. We also examined the effects of gas-liquid flux, various geometric parameters of the TRST (i.e. number of blades, twist angles of the blades, tray heights and sieve hole diameters), tray installation methods (forward and backward) and number of installed trays on the pressure drop. The results indicate that the pressure drop increases with increasing gas-liquid flux, number and twist angles of the blades, but decreases with increasing tray heights and sieve hole diameters. The pressure drop of the tray is largest in backward installation, smaller in first installed location and smallest in forward installation. Compared with other new types of trays, the pressure drop of the TRST is lower and there is a significant resistance performance advantage. In addition, according to the mechanism of gas-liquid flow in the TRST, we established the mathematical model of TRST performance in the range of operating conditions. The fitting values agree well with the experimental values. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In the current study, the effects of different interruptions of fin on the transport characteristics of a nanofluid-cooled electronic heat sink with chevron shape are analyzed numerically. Seven interruptions of fin are explored and compared with the integral case. Water and water-based nanofluid with Al2O3 nanoparticle at volume fractions of 0.5% and 1.0% are tested as the coolant in laminar flow regime (Reynolds number less than 900). All coolants are also tested experimentally in the heat sink equipped with the integral fin, and the achieved data are used to verify the numerical approach. The obtained results disclose that the use of interrupted fins leads to a superior heat transfer process due to a decrease in the fin surface temperature and a rise in the outlet coolant temperature. Simultaneously, it causes considerable decrements in the pressure drop which is because of an increase in the fin porosity of the heat sink. The percentage variation in heat transfer coefficient for the interrupted fins as compared with the integral case is in the range of -9.3% to +43.6% while the percentage variation in the pressure drop is in the range of -43.5% to -92.7%. Among all interrupted models, the one reaching the performance index of 3.09 at the Reynolds number of 300 is the best. Furthermore, the water-based nanofluid shows a better thermal performance and a certain penalty in the pressure drop compared to water. The water-based nanofluid can enhance the performance index of the heat sink by an average of 14.7% and 28.3%, which correspond to 0.5% and 1.0% volume fractions of Al2O3 nanoparticle, respectively. Finally, it can be concluded that the compound technique used for the chevron fin (interruption + nanofluid) can be a good choice in practical applications to improve the overall performance of electronic heat sinks.

AB A membrane separation process was previously developed to remove carbon dioxide from anesthesia partial rebreathing circuits. The process investigated in this study used a cylindrical hollow fiber membrane module with radial flow of the feed gas on the shell side and axial flow of the sweep gas on the lumen side of the hollow fibers. Oxygen was used as the sweep gas in one- and two-pass configurations to facilitate carbon dioxide transfer across the membrane. The polymethylpentene membranes used in this study have previously been shown to have a high selectivity for carbon dioxide over commonly used anesthetic vapours. Therefore, the primary focus of this study was on the carbon dioxide separation performance of different module configurations and the development of a validated model that could be used for further design and optimization studies. A transient pseudo-one-dimensional design model was developed to predict the performance of the membrane system. The model was constructed by dividing the membrane into a distribution of interconnected, equally-sized, perfectly-mixed segments. Steady-state experimental data, collected for a 5% carbon dioxide (balance oxygen) feed gas and a pure oxygen sweep gas, were used to tune the number of segments in the model. The tuned model predictions were then compared to experimental data for the full range of feed and sweep flow rates (1-15 L min (1)). Four different membrane modules were used to explore the impact of configuration on separation performance. The modules varied in diameter (80 mm and 100 mm), hollow fiber packing density (0.213, 0.302, and 0.454), and number of sweep passes (one and two passes). The model provided good predictions of the steady-state membrane performance for the range of operating conditions investigated in this study. Model validity was not found to be very sensitive to the number of segments over the tested range of operating conditions. The number of segments did not need to be readjusted for different flow rates, which indicates that the design model can be used for extrapolating predictions beyond the flow rates and membrane sizes investigated in the current study.

AB Suitably designed laminar duct flows admit chaotic advection which, in concert with diffusion, can lead to rapid heat and mass transport and sharpening of the residence time distribution (RTD). Whilst evolution of these distinct scalar fields are strongly related, the exact relationships between these distinct fields is unknown, nor to what extent they can be simultaneously optimised. In this paper we present a unified framework for the simultaneous optimisation of the three scalar fields; RTD, temperature, and mass concentration. This optimisation is performed in terms of the eigenmodes of the advection-diffusion operator, which generalize classical Taylor-Aris axial dispersion. We apply this optimisation framework to a twisted pipe flow (TPF) at Peclet number Pe = 10(5), and find 47- and 237-fold increases in transverse heat and mass transfer respectively over straight tube flow, along with a 2,000-fold suppression of RTD variance growth. We show that generality of the eigenmode decomposition suggests this framework is universal to all duct flows. Crown Copyright (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The concept of a novel Fixed Bed Bionic Reactor (FBBR) is presented in this work. The core idea is to use distributed input and output network, compact channel structure and small scale packed beds. In the FBBR, fine catalyst particles with high effectiveness can be used while the pressure drop stays at a rather low level, which breaks through the limitations of the existing fixed-bed reactors. The flow distribution uniformity is the key to the design of the FBBR. A general mathematical model is established for the FBBR elementary unit, and concise analytic solutions are obtained to describe the profile of the distribution. Characteristic parameters are extracted from the model and uniformity criteria can be set up as theoretical instructions for the design of the FBBR. To demonstrate the practical value, two application cases are presented. A large scale multilayer radial FBBR is designed for Methanol to Propylene reaction, having the advantages of higher propylene selectivity and productivity. Then a small scale modular FBBR is designed for catalytic combustion of lean methane, having the advantages of being nearly isothermal with autothermal function and being miniaturized and modularized with better flexibility in satisfying different scale of productions.

AB The selectivity and over-oxidation obtained in the oxidation of m-xylene to isophthalic acid by V2O5 nanoparticles encapsulated in TiO2 matrix are controlled by the size of the V2O5 nanoparticles. In this reaction when the size of V2O5 nanoparticles was less than 45 nm at least 16-30% of the m-xylene was lost as carbon oxides. In this work, V2O5@TiO2 catalysts, with V2O5 loadings from 10 to 20 wt% were prepared by trapping V2O5 nanoparticles in a matrix of mesoporous TiO2. We demonstrate herein results of m-xylene oxidation in a fixed-bed reactor (i.d. = 10 mm) for production of isophthalic acid. The aircalcined samples of the catalysts were characterized by different techniques such as FT-IR, XRD, Diffuse-reflectance UV-Vis, FE-SEM, EDX, BET, XPS, and TEM. This novel configuration of V2O5 particles in the TiO2 matrix not only prevents leaching of the catalyst but also improves the catalyst reusability. The optimal amount of V2O5 trapped in the TiO2 matrix was 15 wt%. The best V2O5@TiO2 catalyst activation temperature was 350 degrees C. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Cosolvents are employed to improve the extraction efficiency and modify the selectivity of the main solvent. However, choosing a proper cosolvent in supercritical extraction is an arduous task. This study aimed to predict the best cosolvents for the supercritical CO2 extraction of oleic and linoleic acids using the Hansen solubility theory. Calculations were performed for eight organic cosolvents used in food and pharmaceutical production. The best cosolvents for the solubilization of both fatty acids were short-chain alcohols, ethanol and methanol. The predictions were validated with bubble pressures of the mixtures with a 0.003 fatty acid molar fraction at temperatures of 313.2 K and 323.2 K. The experimental results agreed with the predictions. The effect of pressure was well predicted via the direct relationship between pressure and the solvent density. However, the impact of temperature was not properly foreseen because the variation of solute vapour pressure was not considered. The Hansen theory predicted that the miscibility enhancement of the solute in the supercritical mixture is maximum at low pressures and low cosolvent concentrations, as was experimentally confirmed.

AB Copper complex conductive inks inevitably contains water which is derived from chemicals and humid air. The dual effects of water on the performance of copper complex conductive inks with amines as ligands were investigated for the first time. On one hand, excess water caused the deterioration of copper complexes by interacting with amines to produce high concentration of OH , yielding basic salt, hydroxide or oxide precipitate, which shortened the shelf life of copper inks. The degree of deterioration was related to the amine's coordination ability and alkalinity. On the other hand, trace water could accelerate the thermal decomposition of copper complexes, promote the nucleation of copper, and yield smaller particles to form copper films with denser structure and lower resistivity. The blending of 2-ethylhexylamine (EtHex) and 2-amino-2-methyl-l-propanol (AMP) as ligands to copper formate (Cuf) could balance the dual effects of water on copper complex conductive inks. It was found that Cuf-EtHex-AMP (with 95 mol% EtHex in blended ligands) ink showed strong water resistance. The shelf life of the blended complex ink with additional 2 wt% water was still more than 2 months. The additional water enabled the formation of highly conductive copper films at low heating temperature. The resistivity of the copper film from the blended complex ink with additional 2 wt% water stored for 2 months only increased a little compared to that from the newly prepared ink (from 9.70 mu Omega.cm to 14.42 mu Omega.cm), which could meet the general requirements of printed electronics.

ID NH3-SCR CATALYSTS; CU-SSZ-13; NOX; SITES
AB We identified a new acidic feature in Cu/SSZ-13 catalysts, related to the presence of two distinct desorption peaks in the NH3-TPD profiles, and to the changes in their relative intensity in response to mild hydrothermal aging (Luo et al., 2017). In this work, we have translated those findings into a sensitive laboratory diagnostic methodology for quantifying cumulative aging exposure, based on the ratio of the two NH3-TPD peaks. We have also addressed some practical aspects of applying this methodology to real-world aged samples, by decoupling the effects of sulfur poisoning and of the catalyst loading variability. The developed method yielded a simple kinetic model of the Cu/SSZ-13 catalysts hydrothermal aging, and some useful insights into the practically relevant aspects of the aging process. In particular, we have shown that the aging is cumulative, and that the sequence of the exposure steps does not matter. One other important consequence of the developed model is related to the steep temperature dependence of the aging process (E-a approximate to 168 kJ/mol). As a result, the majority of the on-engine operation exposure, typically below similar to 400 degrees C, has no appreciable impact on the catalyst aging. In contrast, such aging is almost entirely induced by the periodic high-temperature events, such as those related to various system regeneration regimes. We have verified that observation by a 1000-h aging test at 400 degrees C.
   Finally, we expect that the developed method of diagnosing and quantifying cumulative hydrothermal age can be applicable to other types of catalysts which include Cu/SSZ-13 in their formulation, including ammonia oxidation catalysts (AMOX) and SCR on filter (SCRF), since it is based on the intrinsic properties of this metal-exchanged zeolite.

AB We present simulations showing the particulate flows passing through a single membrane pore under a dead-end and constant-pressure condition. We investigate the effects of the rolling friction acting on particles and the particle concentration on the pore clogging phenomena. A decrease in the rolling friction coefficient of particles shifts the clogging position toward the permeate side and decelerates the permeating flux decline. This effect of the rolling friction coefficient decreases with increasing particle concentration. Furthermore, we simulate the permeation of two-component suspensions, which include two types of particles with large and small rolling friction coefficients. The small number of particles with a large friction coefficient drastically accelerate the pore clogging because they first deposit near the pore entrance and trap subsequent particles. This result indicates that particles that are less accumulated on the membrane under a single-component condition may be primary foulants in a multicomponent system. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Formation of gas hydrates in systems with high water content is one of the major challenges facing the petroleum industry today. Conventional mitigation using thermodynamic inhibitors is expensive due to large water volumes, while the most recent flow management strategies (anti-agglomerants, cold flow, etc.) have not yet been adopted because the dynamics of hydrate slurry are insufficiently understood. The present contribution examines a flow of gas, hydrates and water using computational fluid dynamics (CFD). The model couples the effective viscosity of gas-water slurry with the average size of hydrate agglomerates and the adhesive force that binds them. The model was validated against experimental pressure drop, demonstrating tolerable discrepancies. According to the simulations, onset of hydrate plugging is most probably related to the formation of a viscous bed at the gas-slurry interphase at hydrate concentrations slightly above 15%. A simplified theoretical approach is proposed for engineering estimates of pressure drop in the hydrate slurry pipes. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This paper discusses the modelling of CO2 absorption in water as an absorbent via a hollow fiber membrane contactor to predict the performance of the absorption process under various operational conditions. The governing equations are two dimensional. Since, the gas diffusion along the pores is responsible for the mass transfer across the membrane thickness, i.e. both the skin layer and the membrane bulk, how to estimate the effective gas diffusivity has a vital degree of importance. When small pores combined with low pressures are dealt with, a challenging issue appears, i.e. the effective gas diffusivity is a contributive phenomenon, in which, several mechanisms are cooperated. Selecting an inappropriate model, inevitably leads to unrealistic values for the tuning parameters. Conventionally, the Bosanquet equation has been widely used for modelling the gas diffusivity through the membrane pores. In the current paper, it is intended to prove that the Bosanquet model is a limiting form of Wakao et al. model, when we are far enough from the continuum region. The modelling results are compared with six sets of different membranes from the open literature including high and low pressures. The results show that, ignoring the viscous flow contribution in D-g,D-eff (the Bosanquet gas diffusivity model) causes underestimation of the absorption flux. Based on the observations, there is a meaningful consistency between the model and the experimental data once the contribution of the viscous flow in D-eff (the Wakao et al. gas diffusivity model) is considered.

AB Greywater is the main source of municipal wastewater, but lightly polluted. This paper reported a novel forward osmosis (FO) for treating the greywater to obtain pure water. The hollow fiber thin film composite (TFC) FO membrane was synthesized and characterized. For the main organic foulants in greywater, the same FO membrane showed higher rejection in a FO operation than in a hydraulic pressure driven reverse osmosis operation. In a systematic analysis of the FO membrane fouling up to a concentration factor of 10, the protein, casein, was identified as the main factor; conjugation with Ca2+ and SDS accelerated the membrane fouling. Osmotic backwash using caustic solution could effectively recover the FO membrane flux. Moreover, the FO membrane fouling was significantly alleviated after using ferric chloride flocculant as the pretreatment. Water analysis showed that nearly 100% of large organic contaminants such as humic acid, casein, and most of the phosphate ions (below detection limit), were removed by the FO membranes but allowed small amount of SDS and NH4+ to permeate across. The present results provided a scientific and engineering basis for the potential application of forward osmosis membrane based integral process for treating greywater. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB A robust approach to access liquid residence time distribution (RTD) adapted to multiphase flow in porous media is presented. It is tailored to meet specific requirements of small scale systems (centimeter, millimeter or less) with Taylor segmented flow feed. The method involves direct visualization using fluorescence microscopy close to both extremities of a porous packing. Critical image treatment steps and optimization of a versatile discrete model with 4 parameters are detailed and discussed. They allow the precise and rapid determination of RTD curves and their 1st- and 2nd-order moments. The application of the method is successfully illustrated with dense micro-packed beds of sub-millimeter particles and highly porous media like open cell solid foams undergoing a preformed G-L segmented (Taylor) flow. Original results regarding the effect of fluid flowrates and different confined porous media are discussed and lead to a single two-parameter liquid hold up correlation, which is valid for both packings. As usual, RTD broadening is treated as a combination of convective dispersion and mass transfer to a fraction of immobile liquid. The predominant role of mass transfer is underlined with an analysis of characteristic times. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB When small amounts of fine particles are mixed with coarser particles, they tend to form ordered or adhesive mixtures. In order to understand the effect of fine particle amount and cohesion on the adhesive mixing process, discrete element method (DEM) simulations are carried out in which cohesion is represented by surface energy. High-intensity vibrational mixing was used to examine two important and related dynamic processes; fine particle deagglomeration and their subsequent adhesion to coarse particles, by analyzing normalized fine-fine (FF) and coarse-fine (CF) particle contact numbers, respectively, along with the mixing quality. It is found that FF contacts decreases with the mixing time, indicating deagglomeration, before reaching equilibrium; while CF contacts, an indicator of coating, as well as mixing quality increase before reaching equilibrium. A major new finding is that the number of fine particles per coarse particle at equilibrium follows lognormal distribution. The time scales to reach equilibrium FF contact number and mixing quality are comparable, indicating that deagglomeration is the dominant factor for achieving a uniform adhesive mixture. As expected, increasing surface energy of fine particles leads to decreased mixing quality due to stronger agglomerates that cannot be broken by collisions. On the other hand, collision rate can dictate mixing quality, as long as the collision energy is greater than the corresponding detachment energy of fine particles agglomerates. Selected experimental results validate the DEM simulations and their ability to describe the adhesive mixing process. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In this paper, droplet impact on a porous surface is experimentally investigated over a wide range of Weber numbers and surface temperatures. Regime transition criteria have been deduced to determine droplet post-impingement behaviour as a function of the Weber number and surface temperature for which a droplet impacting on a porous surface. Based on the energy balance, an analytical model with improved boundary layer description is proposed to predict maximum spreading of droplet following impact on porous surfaces when the effect of heat transfer is negligible. The results of the model indicate that the spreading process after droplet impact on porous surfaces is governed by the viscous dissipation and matric potential. The maximum-spread model predictions agreed well with experimental measurements reported in this paper and the literature over a large range of Weber numbers and different porous surfaces.

AB Based on the bench-scale impinging entrained-flow gasifier with coal water slurry (CWS) as the feedstock and the development of advanced visualization techniques, the in-situ atomization and flame characteristics of CWS were investigated. A new imaging system was applied to capture the images around the burners in the operating condition. After image post-processing, the instantaneous flame, time-averaged flame and oscillation of the flame were discussed. With the statistical method, the droplet size distribution, oscillation of the droplet concentration and time-dependent droplet size were obtained to analyze the efficiency and stability of the atomization process. The instantaneous flame shows that the atomization and gasification process is turbulent. The time-average CWS flame shows that the atomization angle decreases with an increase in the ratio of elemental oxygen to elemental carbon (O/C ratio). The oscillation of the flame and the atomization process demonstrate that in-situ atomization is closely related to the CWS flame. The diameter and number of droplets after primary atomization decrease with the increase of the O/C ratio. The decreases in median diameter and unconsumed CWS rate demonstrate that the increase in O/C ratio improves the efficiency of the atomization process. The reduction in oscillation scopes of the droplet concentration and size demonstrates that the increase in O/C ratio improves the stability of the atomization process. In addition, the droplet concentration c in three different O/C conditions is 17.8 kg.m(-3), 5.9 kg.m(-3) and 1.6 kg.m(-3) which demonstrates that the CWS is the dilute phase in the OMB gasifier.

AB This article focuses on the design and implementation of model-based control strategies for real time control of crystal size distribution (CSD) in semi batch crystallization processes. The objective of the feedback controller is to reach a desired particle mean size while the standard deviation is controlled in a feed-forward fashion. Alternative model-based control strategies are formulated and implemented for a target mean size. An image processing technique based on wavelet-fractal and energy signature analysis is employed to determine online CSD status for the controller's corrective actions. To validate the proposed model-based control strategies, unseeded crystallization of sodium chloride in water using ethanol as antisolvent is performed in an experimental bench-scale semi-batch crystallizer.

AB The gas-liquid mass transfer of oxygen has been examined experimentally in a helically-coiled pipe using an optical colorimetric method. Two tracer redox-reactions have been used for this purpose: (i) methylene blue and (ii) resazurin. The gas hold-up has been varied from 0.1 to 0.6, and liquid flow rate from 0.37 to 0.68 l/min, both leading to plug-flow conditions in the helix for all parameter combinations. A progress variable has been defined to measure the advancement of the reaction and thus, oxygen transfer to the liquid. The resazurin reaction turned out to be more appropriate for mass transfer studies, due to the bigger time constant difference of oxidation and reduction. Therefore, it can be adapted more easily to the specific conditions of the set-up. It also possesses more intense colours and higher fluorescence intensity, which might be useful for other mass transfer studies. As expected, the oxygen mass transfer increases with gas hold up, but liquid flow rate has little influence. A comparison with a horizontal tube of the same diameter shows the drastically increased mass transfer in the helix, due to better radial mixing and different flow pattern. Depending on the experimental conditions, oxygen concentration in the helix was up to twice that of the horizontal tube. This can be explained by the much higher liquid side mass transfer velocity, which is determined in this study from the experimental ka-values and specific bubble surface per turn of the helix. For this purpose, bubble dimensions and gas-liquid cell volumes have been determined from the experimental images. The paper thus presents a locally resolved characterization of gas-liquid mass transfer in a helically coiled reactor. The high mass transfer especially during the first turns of the helix shows its advantages compared to a straight tube. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB A hybrid process design based on reactive distillation (RD) combined with pervaporation membrane systems was proposed for the production of ethyl levulinate (LAEE) via esterification. In the proposed hybrid configuration, LAEE is produced from the bottom stream of the RD column while the ethanol/water mixture from the overhead is fed to an additional column. The azeotropic mixture in the overhead of the additional column is separated in the pervaporation unit, and the ethanol-rich stream is recycled to the RD column. An RD-only configuration with excess ethanol reactant was also examined to investigate the benefit of excess ethanol reactant and the azeotrope mixture separation. The proposed RD with pervaporation hybrid configuration provided 61.0% and 71.0% reductions of the total annual cost and energy, respectively, compared to the conventional RD configuration with excess levulinic acid (LA) reactant and 6.0% and 13.0%, respectively, as compared to the conventional RD configuration with excess ethanol reactant. The results demonstrated the advantage of the proposed hybrid RD process using pervaporation for lowering the cost and improving the energy efficiency of LAEE production. Different pervaporation arrangements (such as series and parallel arrangements) were discussed in connection with the two main variables (operating temperature and concentration gradient) affecting the membrane flux. The series arrangement was more suitable for the LAEE hybrid process because the influence of the operating temperature is dominant in this process. Thermal intensification in the RD-pervaporation was also examined for exploring further energy reduction. This thermally coupled RD-pervaporation hybrid configuration provided further reductions in total annual cost and energy by 63.0% and 73.0%, respectively, compared to the conventional RD configuration with excess LA reactant.

AB Graphene oxide (GO) membranes have shown promising gas separation characteristics specially for hydrogen showing potential for industrial applications. However, GO membranes made by filtration, the most common synthesis method, contain wrinkles affecting their gas separation characteristics and the method itself is difficult to scale up. In this work, high quality GO membranes are made from GO suspension by easily scalable spray coating technique (and also by filtration method for comparison) on hydrophilic polyester track etch substrates. GO sheet suspensions of large sheet average size (33 mu m) and dilute concentrations are used to minimize GO sheet edge-to-edge interactions and minimize extrinsic wrinkle formation. Single gas permeation and separation experiments of equimolar H-2/CO2 binary mixture were conducted to evaluate the permeation and separation characteristics of prepared membranes. GO membranes prepared by spray coating offer gas characteristics similar to those made by filtration, however using dilute GO suspension in spray coating reduces the formation of extrinsic wrinkles causing reduction in the porosity of the inter-sheet pathway where the transport of large gas molecules dominates. This study demonstrates an efficient, scalable and cost-effective approach for synthesizing large area GO membranes with enhanced hydrogen separation. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB The common design methods for mixers agitating non-Newtonian fluid flow are not suitable for developing a completely new geometrical shape. These design methods were originally intended only to scale an existing mixer with several correlation methods. For this, the dimensionless power characteristics of the mixer is first determined for agitating Newtonian fluid flow. Subsequently, for the desired operating conditions, the apparent viscosity of the non-Newtonian fluid is derived using the mentioned correlation principles. After setting the desired geometrical parameters, it is possible to calculate the apparent Reynolds number. By comparing the apparent Reynolds number with the dimensionless power characteristics, the estimated power consumption and, therefore, the engine to drive the mixer can be determined. This procedure comes with the assumption of a valid correlation between Newtonian and non-Newtonian fluid flow, which is not physical. Furthermore, the question of how to develop the geometric shape of a mixer for a considered operation point is still open. In this paper, a new method is introduced to develop the shape of a propeller mixer for arbitrary operating conditions in pseudoplastic fluids by analytical methods. The method is based on the consequently implemented blade element momentum theory. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Two key assumptions are usually made while deriving analytical solutions of coupled kinetics and transport equations in a single channel on the cathode plate of a proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC). These are: plug flow and uniform oxygen concentration along the depth of the channel. However these assumptions are not always valid under typical operating conditions of a PEMFC, and particularly so at high current density. In this article we relax these two assumptions and present approximate analytical solutions of the governing equations using the methodology of separation of variables followed by power series solution. Spatial profiles of oxygen concentration and current density were derived, which led to the final derivation of a comprehensive current-potential relationship (polarization curve) in the reaction-controlled regime of an operational PEMFC. We compare polarization curves predicted by the present model with predictions of the earlier analytical model and also with a complete 3D-simulation of the same flow geometry and operation conditions. The local profiles of oxygen concentration and the polarization curve predicted by the present model compare far better with the 3D simulations than the earlier analytical model. While this comparison highlights the importance of the effects of finite oxygen diffusion rate and velocity profile in the channel on the polarization curves, it also points to other important factors that affect the current-potential relation.

AB This research is dedicated to a study of BaSO4 crystallization process in a batch stirred reactor. The temporal development of the precipitation process is measured by conductivity at global and local levels. The effect of the macromixing on temporal evolution of local conductivity is shown in the experimental results obtained by EIT. The effects of the mixing intensity and the BaCl2 feed location on the CSD and morphology are considered. Morphology of the crystals was found to be independent from mixing intensity in the studied range. The CFD simulations of the mixing hydrodynamics were used to estimate the influence of turbulent dispersion on crystal size. The correlation of mean crystal size and TR number proposed by (Torbacke and Rasmuson, 2001) has been checked against d(90) in the range of 10(3)-10(5) and showed reasonable agreement. The scatter of the results plotted can be explained by the macromixing scale and critical time of the crystallization not included into TR number. The combined effect of mixing at meso and macro scales onto crystal size is proposed. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In this paper, we aim to account for the partitioning of finite sized ions and electric double layer (EDL) overlapping effects on the electrostatics and hydrodynamics of soft nanofluidics by stablishing a modified Poisson-Boltzmann (MPB) equation enjoying mean field approach. The application of the present MPB equation enables us to describe the interaction between the steric effect and electrostatic repulsion of EDL ions due to permittivity difference of polyelectrolyte layer (PEL) and electrolyte solution. Utilizing the Debye-Huckel approximation pertinent to low surface potentials, we analytically derive the solutions of electric potential and velocity profiles of mixed electroosmotic and pressure driven flows in polyelectrolyte grafted nanotubes. As well, we theoretically predict the electrophoretic mobility of soft colloidal particles immersed in aqueous solutions of NaCl, KCl, NaMnO4 and LilO(3) in the presence of ion partitioning effect (IPE). For the case of larger surface potentials, the nonlinear governing equations of the problem are analyzed by finite difference method, and the accuracy of the numerical solutions are examined by verifying the results with existing experimental data. Moreover, we calculate three electrokinetically associated phenomena namely streaming potential, electroviscous effect and electro-chemomechanical energy conversion (ECMEC) efficiency through soft nanotube having constant surface potential/charge density. Then, we compare our results under the purview of the present MPB equation with those predicted by point-like charge modeling of ions. The essential findings of our investigation highlight the importance of accounting for IPE arising from the permittivity difference of PEL and bulk salt solution when high degrees of softness, charge density and thickness of the PEL are encountered in transport mechanism in soft nanofluidics. We also show that one of the most important consequences of IPE is several fold increase of electrophoretic mobility of soft particle and ECMEC efficiency of soft nanotube due to increasing the PEL-electrolyte permittivity difference.

AB The expansion and structural parameters for a series of crosslinked porous polymers are discussed during their swelling. In the study, commercial Amberlite XAD2, XAD4 XAD16 and XAD7HP resins of varying porosity and polarity were used as model polymers. Videomicroscopy LM is combined with in-situ strain-stress measurements during the process of wetting the polymer with ethanol. The force exerted by the expansion of the spherical polymer particle due to swelling reflects the structural properties of the polymer and is related to the total porosity of a given type of polymer matrix. The pore structure of the samples was characterized by liquid nitrogen adsorption and their swelling degree was assessed by light microscopy. The deswelling curves, represented by strain-stress curves, are stepped for polymers of lower porosity; the first step represents the evacuation of the solvent from the pores. This process is regulated by the external pore openings in a particle; the second, elongated step on the deswelling curve represents the evaporation of the solvent from the polymer network.

AB For many engineering applications, measurements of velocity and pressure distributions in the system are of fundamental importance to provide insights into the flow characteristics. In the present study, the experiments were carried out in an oscillating grid system in absence and presence of two different bubble diameters (D-b = 2.70 and 3.52 mm) rise using the non-intrusive two-dimensional (2D) particle image velocimetry (PIV) at the low Taylor-Reynolds number (Re-lambda) ranging from 12 to 60. Using the measured PIV velocity data, the instantaneous pressure fluctuations were estimated by integrating the full viscous form of the Navier-Stokes (N-S) equation. The obtained pressure field was compared with three dimensional (3D) computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation which was found to be in good agreement. The pressure spectra of single and two phase flow cases were evaluated by taking Fast Fourier transformation (FFT) of the computed pressure fluctuations. A spectral slope of -7/3 was found in the inertial subrange of the single-phase pressure spectrum. In contrast, the two-phase pressure spectrum exhibited a slope less steep than -7/3 in the inertial subrange because of the extra production of turbulence in the presence of bubble. For single-phase flow, the ratio of pressure integral length scale to the velocity integral length scale (L-p/L) was found to be similar to 0.67, and the pressure Taylor microscale (lambda(p)) was approximately 0.79 +/- 0.03 of the velocity Taylor microscale (lambda) within the Taylor-Reynolds number range studied. The scaling ratios based on the single-phase experimental results were compared with existing theory and DNS results and found to accord well; however, these ratios deviate from the theoretical values for two-phase flow. Also, the energy dissipation rate was evaluated based on the pressure spectrum and found to be over-predicted (similar to 32%) compared those calculated from the velocity spectrum.

AB This work presents the proposal and experimental validation of an online optimization strategy for maximizing the hydrogen production rate (HPR) in an anaerobic bioreactor through the dark fermentation of glucose. The proposal comprises a heuristic optimization strategy, a coupled nonlinear observer, and a PI controller to track the desired maximum HPR. The optimization is achieved by solving online a nonlinear programming problem which considers the relation between the HPR and the organic loading rate (OLR), such that the latter is manipulated to maximize the former. Since the OLR requires online knowledge of the unmeasured influent substrate concentration, the nonlinear observer is used to estimate it using measurements of the hydrogen flow rate at the output of the bioreactor. This observer comprises the coupled operation of a robust Luenberger observer and a super-twisting observer. The proposal was designed and tested experimentally in a continuous stirred tank laboratory bioreactor fed with glucose, and the results are very promising. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB In this study, a reaction enhanced surface segregation method was explored for in-situ construction of antifouling separation layer on membrane surface. Polyvinyl pyrrolidine (PVP) is used as the surface segregation agent in the casting solution and polyacrylic acid (PAA) is used as the additive in the coagulation bath. During the membrane formation process, PVP and PAA spontaneously migrate to the surface of the polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) support in an opposite direction and form a crosslinked separation layer based on the hydrogen bonding interaction. The resultant layer has smaller effective pore size and higher hydrophilicity compared with the PVDF control membrane, which renders enhanced antifouling and separation performance. In the ultrafiltration of oil-water emulsion, the rejection was 100%, the initial water flux was 695 +/- 33 L m(-2) h(-1) bar(-1), and the FRR was 95.2%; meanwhile, in the ultrafiltration of BSA solution, the rejection was 90.3%, the initial water flux was 603 +/- 18 L m(-2) h(-1) bar(-1) and the FRR was 92.3%. This study offered a novel and facile method for antifouling membrane surface construction. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The effects of confinement and electrostatic interactions on the ion diffusion in the particle-rock contact area yields a delay in particle detachment during low-salinity water injection in porous media. The objective of the work is laboratory and mathematical modelling of the effects of delayed particle detachment on colloid-suspension transport in porous media. We present the governing system for single-phase particulate flow accounting for non-equilibrium fines detachment. The exact solution for one-dimensional flow with varying salinity is derived. Laboratory coreflood tests on low-salinity water injection are performed. The measured breakthrough fine particle concentration and pressure drop across the core are matched by the analytical model with high accuracy. Introduction of delay in the model removes the concentration shocks present in the instant fines detachment model as fines detach continuously throughout the injection period. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB A dual-tip conductivity probe was used to measure local radial gas holdups and bubble chord lengths to study the local flow regime and bubble size distribution in a scrubbing-cooling chamber cold model apparatus containing slender particles. The results showed that the cross-section averaging gas holdups with different fiber volume fractions and aspect ratios could be estimated within errors of +/- 10% using the modified Kataoka-Ishii bubbly flow semi-empirical correlation at superficial gas velocities ranging from 0.074 m/s to 0.37 m/s. The local flow regime map showed that an obvious bubbly flow formed near the inner wall of the liquid bath due to the effect of wall shear stress, while a cap-bubbly flow formed in other annulus regions due to the emergence of cap bubbles. Chord length distributions were transformed into bubble size distributions by decomposing the measured chord length distributions and estimating the bubble shape factors. Bubble size was categorized into two types-small spherical and large nonspherical bubbles-depending on if the equivalent diameter of the bubbles was smaller or larger than 2 mm. Liquid turbulence, shear stress between the fluid and the wall and liquid backmixing were enhanced by increasing the superficial gas velocity, which affected the size distributions of rising and descending bubbles as well as that of bubble populations. The extent of turbulence suppression and "fiber separation walls" varied with the fiber volume fractions, which affected the bubble size distribution in different regions. The fiber number density characterizing the variation of the fiber aspect ratio with different fiber diameter and length was used to study the bubble size distribution. The bubble size distribution at different aspect ratios was affected by interactions among fibers, bubbles, the fluid and the wall. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Fluid flow and heat transfer characteristics in packed beds are of importance in many fields of study. However, experimental characterization and model validation of the numerical methods used to study packed beds is difficult. Utilizing nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), we present a novel approach to track the melt front (and thus melt temperature) in a non-isothermal packed bed. The approach tracks the melt front through packed beds of wax encapsulated phase change material (PCM) by taking advantage of the change in T-2 associated with phase change. Additionally, velocity maps of the flow in the pore space of the same packed bed sample are obtained. The approach uses the H-1 signal from the PCM packing and the F-19 signal from the flowing fluid to allow monitoring of both particle bed structure/phase and flow velocities in the same sample with the use of a dual tune coil. Together, this information can be used to probe the heat transfer characteristics of packed beds experimentally. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB A four parameter cubic equation of state, GDN-CEOS, is presented to describe thermodynamic properties of pure fluids and mixtures. We have cast three of the four parameters in terms of the remaining parameter and all the parameters are temperature independent. A new alpha function is proposed in the attractive term of the CEOS; which requires two compound-specific parameters determined from saturation vapor pressure data at two reduced temperature points T-r = 0.5 and 0.7. Hence, the GDN CEOS has five inputs per substance: the critical temperature (T-c), the critical pressure (P-c), the critical compressibility factor (Z(c)) and two compound specific parameters (m, n) of the alpha function. The saturated vapor pressure and liquid density of 334 pure compounds, representing a large variety of functional groups, are predicted successfully. Other thermodynamic properties such as isobaric and isochoric heat capacities, sound velocity, compressed liquid density and enthalpy of vaporization have been calculated using GDN CEOS with remarkably good accuracy. The GDN CEOS is further applied to the prediction of bubble pressure and vapor mole fraction of several binary mixtures using the van der Waals one fluid mixing rules. The accuracy of GDN CEOS is demonstrated by comparing results with three well-known equations of state: Haghtalab-Kamali-Mazloumi-Mahmoodi (HKM1), Modified Peng Robinson (MPR) and Patel-Teja (PT) cubic equations of state.

AB Solute mass transfer is considered from the outside to the inside of a circulating drop in the context of liquid-liquid extraction. Specifically an internal problem is treated with resistance to mass transfer dominated by the liquid inside the drop. The Peclet number of the circulation is large, on the order of tens of thousands. A model is proposed by which the mass transfer into the drop begins in a boundary layer regime, but subsequently switches into a so called streamline-averaged regime. Solutions are developed for each regime, and also for the switch between them. These solutions are far easier to obtain than those of the full advection-diffusion equations governing this high Peclet number system, which are very stiff. During the boundary layer regime, the rate at which solute mass within the drop grows with time depends on Peclet number, with increases in Peclet number implying faster growth. However larger Peclet numbers also imply that the switch to the streamline-averaged regime happens sooner in time, and with less solute mass having been transferred to date. In the streamline-averaged regime, solute concentration varies across streamlines but not along them. In spite of the very large Peclet number, the rate of mass transfer is controlled diffusively, specifically by the rate of diffusion from streamline-to-streamline: sensitivity to the Peclet number is thereby lost. The model predictions capture, at least qualitatively, findings reported in literature for the evolution of the solute concentration in the drop obtained via full numerical simulation.

AB This work investigates the effect of condensable Hg vapour on the transport of N-2 gas across cobalt oxide silica (CoOxSi) membranes. Experimental results suggest that Hg significantly affects N-2 permeation at 100 and 200 degrees C, though this effect is negligible at 300 degrees C. This effect was found to have a correlation with Hg adsorption on CoOxSi xerogels. In order to understand the Hg effect in the transport phenomena of N-2 permeation, the oscillator model was used to model gas transport through pores with different sizes. By including effective medium theory (EMT), the oscillator model fitted well the experimental results and gave good prediction of mass transfer in ultra-microporous materials with a tri-modal pore size distribution, such as silica membranes. It is postulated that Hg seeks lower level potentials in micro-pores, and therefore Hg molecules tend to block small pores (2.5-4 angstrom from 2.9 angstrom), or reduce the average pore size of larger pores (6.7-7.8 angstrom and 12-14 angstrom). Although N-2 permeation decreased with the presence of Hg, it did not decrease when the Hg load was increased by a factor of ten; this strongly suggests the adsorption of Hg molecules in the smaller pores (2.5-4.0 angstrom), or along the pore wall for the larger pore ranges (6.7-7.8 angstrom and 12-14 angstrom).

AB Aqueous ammonia is a promising chemical absorbent for CO2 capture but its high volatility leads to important solvent leakage necessitating expensive solvent recovery strategies. This study investigates the potential of using hollow fiber membrane contactors with composite membranes instead of packed columns to reduce solvent leakage. In this study, we used a composite membrane with a thin, dense selective layer (non-porous) coated on a microporous support to favor CO2 transfer over NH3. We developed one-dimensional adiabatic multi-component transfer models to simulate the capture process using both hollow fiber membrane contactors and packed columns. These models were validated with laboratory-scale and pilot-scale data. Simulations under industrial relevant operation conditions were conducted to investigate process performance as a function of membrane characteristics, i.e. membrane dense layer thickness, selectivity and the micro-porous support mass-transfer coefficient. For contactors using homemade selective membranes, the CO2 specific absorption capacity was of 2.7 mol/m(3)/s, which is roughly twenty times higher than values for our simulations in packed columns. The corresponding NH3 slip reduction was of 4.3%. A parametric study revealed that thick dense membrane layers led to greater reductions of ammonia slip but that this corresponded to lower specific CO2 absorption capacity, highlighting an important trade-off between two performance parameters.

AB A Lagrangian model has been derived that describes the size, species composition and velocity of an individual gas bubble as it ascends through a vertical column with stagnant liquid and exchanges mass with the other phase. Various correlations for the liquid-side mass transfer coefficient for laminar flow have been implemented in the Lagrangian model and the predictions are compared with available experimental data in the literature. The predictability of the Lagrangian model is in general not acceptable due to the limitations of the available theoretical framework employed for deriving the existing correlations for the mass transfer coefficient. The various mass transfer coefficients give very different simulation results, and furthermore, the experimental data show a transient behavior in the change of bubble size due to mass transfer which is not captured by the Lagrangian model. An over- or underestimation of the interface mass transfer flux will give an erroneous change of bubble size, which may have significant influence on the predicted bubble rise velocity - in particular if the drag coefficient is very sensitive to the size of the bubble. It is emphasized that the cause of discrepancy between the simulation results and experimental data is not due to the Lagrangian model but mainly caused by the lack of good models for the mass transfer coefficient.

AB A side-entry propeller was designed and introduced in this study. The mixing performance of shear thinning fluids in a cylindrical stirred vessel equipped with this propeller was experimentally investigated via an ultrasonic Doppler anemometer (UDA, experimental results were consistent with theoretical findings. The power number and Reynolds number of this propeller were evaluated by using Chhabra, Metzner and Reed equations. Results showed that the power number versus the Reynolds number curves were highly comparable with Metzner and Reed equations. The velocity jet vectors flow field of 320, 380, and 440 rpm were described in detail. These findings demonstrated that the circulation loops, cavern size, and shape were highly influenced by shear thinning parameters and operating conditions. The average of the velocity profiles from five sample lines in front of the propeller was utilized to analyze the effect of rheological properties and operating conditions on the propeller. The axial, radial and tangential 2D velocity profiles located at one sample line (200 mm) in front of the propeller at the design rotation speed were evaluated. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The effect of water-soluble anionic binders and a modified cationic-precipitated calcium carbonate layerby-layer structure on dye ink spreading and absorption has been studied. The multilayered coating was alternately spray-coated onto the substrate in order to determine dye interdiffusion and specific interaction including solvent absorption behavior in the nano- and microporous layers. The amount of the hydrophilic binder in the top coating was varied in order to adjust the porosity and to determine the effect of electrostatic charge interaction and to adjust dye fixation. Cationic nano- and microporous coatings and particle assemblies were created by spray-coating with cationic calcium carbonate precipitated in the presence of PDADMAC. The deposition of dye on the various coatings revealed that a small amount of anionic binder in the top coating favoured the absorption and spreading of dye and solvent, whereas a higher binder dose closed the pores and reduced the dye fixation and rate of solvent absorption. Although the top layer is essential for dye retention, it was demonstrated that the multilayering is essential not only for dye setting and dye capturing mechanism but can be utilized for vertically controlling the dye penetration and retention in the formed hydrophilic gel complex, which has a significant influence on optical effects and mechanical durability.

AB We present a new compressive scheme to simulate species transfer across fluid interfaces using the Volume-Of-Fluid method. We show that at high Peclet numbers, the standard Continuous Species Transfer (CST) generates large numerical diffusion in the phase concentration that can lead to inaccurate simulation of interface exchanges in a two-phase system. To solve this issue, the derivation of the concentration advection flux is revisited. We obtain an additional compressive term in the species concentration equation. This novel approach is labelled Compressive CST approach (C-CST). The method and the input of the compressive term are validated by comparison with analytical solutions of two-phase flow and species transport in a 1D tube. The C-CST approach reduces significantly the numerical errors. Then, the approach is used to investigate and upscale species transfer during drainage in 2D porous media. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Aerated stirred tanks are frequently used equipment in industries ranging from chemical engineering and biotechnology to minerals processing. In principle, CFD simulation of such equipment on industrial scales is feasible within the Euler-Euler framework of interpenetrating continua. Practical application, however, requires suitable closure models to account for phenomena on the scale of individual bubbles, which are not resolved in this approach. The present work applies a set of closure relations that was previously used with good success to describe bubbly flows in pipes and bubble columns. It turns out that model extensions are needed concerning turbulence and the drag force. To validate the model a comprehensive set of experimental data including gas fraction as well as liquid velocity and turbulence has been assembled from different literature sources. The finally proposed extended model compares reasonably well with this dataset. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB A pore-scale model is applied to investigate reactive mass transport in dual porosity media. We use a framework based on the Stokes-Brinkman flow to model reactive flow in porous media with multiscale features. The numerical method involves fluid flow in pore space as well as flow in the rock matrix with microporosity. Reactive transport simulations are performed in a simple fractured porous medium and carbonates. The results are compared against the predictions in regimes of Stokes flow where the microporosity of rocks is excluded. In the fractured porous medium, wormholing dissolution is observed while face dissolution occurs when microporosity is ignored for the same Peclet and Damkohler numbers. This is explained by the penetration of reactive fluid flow through the rock matrix by Stokes-Brinkman flow. Reactive transport is also simulated in a Ketton carbonate. We compare the simulation results with published dynamic micro-CT imaging experiments for dissolution. Inclusion of microporosity leads to more accurate predictions of the pore space structures. The effect of microporosity on pore structure and permeability-porosity relationships is also explored in the carbonate samples with a range of matrix permeability values. The results show that the impact of microporosity on rock permeability variations is dependent on the ratio of matrix permeability to the overall permeability of the porous medium. Greater errors in permeability predictions are observed in the cases with higher ratios. This paper illustrates the significance of microporosity in reactive transport and improves the understanding of reactive transport in porous domains with multiscale features.

AB It was demonstrated previously that a system consisting of a dinuclear iron complex with the ligand HPTB (N,N,N',N'-tetrakis[2-benzimidazolylmethyl]-1,3-diamino-2-propanol) reacts with dioxygen to form a peroxido complex that may be used for the oxidation of organic substrates. Detailed kinetic studies using stopped-flow techniques and a SuperFocus mixer clearly demonstrate that this complex has a high potential for future applications in catalytic selective oxidation processes in industry. Especially for that reason a reaction KIT system for easy handling was developed that allows to start with a stable iron (III) complex that is reduced (activated) prior to its oxidation with dioxygen.

AB Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) measurement in gas-liquid bubbly flows is a challenging task, mainly due to the dispersion of the laser light caused by the gas-liquid interfaces. A common solution adopted is the use of fluorescent seeding particles associated with a bandpass filter for the laser light. Therefore, the camera captures only the light fluoresced by the seeding particles, filtering the laser light dispersed by the gas-liquid interfaces and measuring a velocity field which corresponds to the liquid phase, seeded with the particles. However, even for relatively low gas fractions, the fluoresced light reflected by the interfaces distorts the measurements, as it illuminates particles out from the laser plane. In addition, the fluoresced light also reflects at the interfaces, distorting the measurements and trending to overshoot the measured liquid velocities In this work, PIV measurements of air-water bubbly flows in a small diameter pipe (D = 26.2 mm) are performed with fluorescent tracer particles (PIV/LIF). A new method for the phase discrimination in PIV was developed to overcome the problems caused by the presence of bubbles in the flow, which uses the pixels intensity information of each interrogation window, to identify if that window corresponds to liquid or bubble region. To validate the PIV procedure, a Particle Tracking Velocimetry (PTV) algorithm was also developed to measure the bubbles velocities, based on similar implementations found in literature, but some corrections were also proposed to overcome the bubble overlap phenomena which arises in bubbly pipe flows, when backward illumination is used. The PIV and the PTV methods were tested and validated by a series of distinct gas void fraction and bubble diameters experimental cases, confirming the accuracy and reliability of both methods. The proposed method was used to analyze a set of upward laminar and turbulent bubbly flows, showing that the averaged axial velocity and the dispersed gas bubbles modify the turbulence intensity profiles.

AB Ionic liquids (ILs) have great potential for separating gases as well as avoiding solvent loss and environmental pollution. An in-depth understanding of the interaction mechanism between ILs and gases is extremely important for exploring and developing high-performing ILs for gas separation. Quantum chemistry is a powerful approach for gaining insight into separation mechanisms. Herein, with the aid of this method, the interaction mechanisms of three representative ILs, i.e., diethylmethylsulfonium tricyan degrees methane ([S-221][CCN3]), triethylsulfonium acetate ([S-222][Ace]), and 1-2(-hydroxyethyl )-3-methylimidazolium bisKtrifluoromethyl)sulfonyllimide ([OHemim][NTf2]), with CO2/CH4, C2H2/C2H4, and NH3/CH4 mixtures are studied. The results show that hydrogen bonds (H-bonds), which are mainly electrostatic dominant (and sometimes even covalent dominant when the H-bond is sufficiently strong), play a crucial role in gas separation. Furthermore, there is a linear relationship between the distance of the H-bonds and both electron density (rho(BCP)) and Laplacian values (del(2)rho(BCP)). Symmetry adapted perturbation theory revealed that electrostatic energies are the main contributors to the total attractive energies between ILs and gases ([OHemim][NTf2]-NH3, [S-221][CCN3]-CO2, and [S-222][Ace]-C2H2). Therefore, based on the above results, we can design the ILs with specific functional groups, which are easy to form Hbonds with the gases to be separated. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The mixed linker metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) consisting of a variety of organic linkers functionalized by multiple functional groups exhibit better performance in carbon capture due to the increased surface heterogeneity. In order to explore the influence of the framework topology and mixed functionalities on the carbon capture performance, in this work, Zr-MOFs in three topologies (csq, ftw, scu) with each composed by one of the three types of linkers of different lengths were constructed, which were then functionalized by three types of functional groups (-F, -NH2, -OCH3), respectively. Grand canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) simulations were used to investigate CO2 adsorption performance of all created MOFs. We revealed that among the parent MOFs consisted of identical building blocks but in different topologies, ftw-MOFs exhibit the highest CO2 working capacity and CO2/N-2 selectivity due to the strong affinity towards CO2. Moreover, the CO2 adsorption performance of ftw-MOFs shows obvious dependence on the pore size, consistent with their host-adsorbate interaction energy, which is not the fact for csqMOFs and scu-MOFs. The enhanced CO2 adsorption performance upon functionalization of MOFs displays pore-size dependence as well, especially for -NH2 functionalized frameworks in csq and scu, which is mostly attributed to the enhanced host-adsorbate Coulombic interaction. The proposed effects of the topology, the pore size and the functional group on CO2 adsorption performance of MOFs obtained in this study may provide meaningful insight into the rational design of high-performing MOFs for carbon capture by tuning the topology, pore size and functionality of frameworks.

AB A novel granular discrete element method (DEM) is introduced to simulate mixtures of particles of any convex shape. To quickly identify pairs of particles in contact, the method first uses a broad-phase and a narrow-phase contact detection strategy. After this, a contact resolution phase finds the contact normal and penetration depth. A new algorithm is introduced to effectively locate the contact point in the geometric center of flat faces in partial contact. This is important for a correct evaluation of the torque on each particle, leading to a much higher stability of stacks of particles than with previous algorithms. The granular DEM is used to generate random packings in a cylindrical vessel. The simulated shapes include non-spherical particles with different aspect ratio cuboids, cylinders and ellipsoids. More complex polyhedral shapes representing sand and woodchip particles are also used. The latter particles all have a unique shape and size, resembling real granular particle packings. All packings are analyzed extensively by investigating positional and orientational ordering. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB CO2 capture from ambient air is an interesting option for CO2 enrichment in greenhouses. In this study, adsorbents comprised of hydrated Na2CO3 supported over activated carbon honeycombs were prepared, characterized and tested for CO2 capture from air. The adsorption of H2O and the formation of the hydrates were studied by means of FT-IR spectroscopy. The inlet CO2 concentration showed to have a major influence on the conversion yield into NaHCO3, and the results fitted well to the Toth model. A statistical model of the CO2 capture capacity was obtained to get insight into the key parameters of the adsorption process. The air temperature and its moisture content showed to have the largest impact on the CO2 capture, while the flow rate had a minor influence. The chemical reaction path during the CO2 adsorption showed to be determined by the relative humidity conditions inside the reactor. Addition of more salt on the carrier showed to improve the CO2 capture capacity, but this is limited by the strength of the honeycomb carrier. Finally, a preliminary desorption test via a mild temperature and moisture swing was run to assess the feasibility of the process for application in greenhouses. The results showed that the required volume of adsorbent would be roughly 1/1000 of the total volume of a closed greenhouse assuming a target CO2 level of 1200 ppm. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The rotating packed bed (RPB) is a promising advanced reactor used in industrial gas-liquid two-phase reaction processes because of its high phase contact efficiency and mixing efficiency. Investigation of RPBs using CFD simulations will improve the understanding of physical behaviours of gas and liquid flows in such reactors. Currently, CFD simulations on the RPBs only focus on the volume of fluid (VOF) method. However, the VOF method is not suitable for simulations of pilot-scale 2D and 3D RPBs due to the limitations in computer resources, while the Eulerian method using a porous media model is a promising alternative method but it is rarely reported. The reason is that there are no suitable porous media models that accurately describe the drag force between the gas and liquid, the gas and solids and the liquid and solids due to the high porosity and the stacked wire screen packing used in RPBs. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to propose a new model for modelling RPBs. The new proposed model is based on the Kolodziej high porosity wire screen one-phase porous media model. In this work, two experimental counter-current gas-liquid flow cases from the literatures have been used for validating the CFD simulation results. Finally, the new model has been compared with the current porous media models for traditional spherical or structured slit packed beds, which are the Attou, Lappalainen, Iliuta and Zhang models. The simulation results show that the proposed new model is the most appropriate and accurate model for the simulation of RPBs among all the models investigated in this paper. (C) 2018 The Author(s).

AB A comprehensive study of the melting process inside a capsule can potentially take full advantages of latent heat of phase change materials (PCMs). The present study was devoted to the problem of complex interaction of natural convection and melting of PCMs inside a spherical capsule under different sizes. The numerical results, simulated by lattice Boltzmann method (LBM), were compared with experimental data and published simulations. The results showed that LBM presented desirable accuracy compared to traditional computational fluid dynamics (CFD) methods. Then, the effects of non-uniform PCM properties, expressed by the solid/liquid thermal diffusivity ratio, on the melting rate were found to be nonlinear in different melting stages. The non-dimensional fully melting time reduced with the increase of the surface temperature and the capsule size, and the former compared to the latter could have a greater influence on the melting rate. Moreover, the non-dimensional fully melting time reduced when increasing of the capsule diameter at the macro-scale; while there was a near-invariable non-dimensional fully melting time when the capsule size was changed at the micro-scale. The good understanding of the phase change process inside the capsule would provide essential information to develop a multi-scale model of microencapsulated PCM slurries. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB A combined exhaust aftertreatment system consisting of a diesel oxidation catalyst (DOC), pipe and selective catalytic reduction of nitrogen oxides (SCR) is studied in this paper by the means of mathematical modeling and simulations. Pt/gamma-Al2O3 DOC and V2O5-WO3/TiO2 SCR catalysts for heavy-duty Diesel engines are examined. First, spatially 1D models of the DOC, SCR and pipe are introduced and calibrated using the measured engine test data. The models are then employed in a simulation study of the effects of Pt loading, PtOx formation and pipe configuration on the NO2 yield in DOC and the resulting deNO(x) performance of the SCR in the driving cycles ETC and WHTC. It is shown that there exists optimum washcoat loading in the DOC with respect to NOx conversion in SCR and that the minimization of heat losses in the connecting pipe can further improve the NOx conversion. Finally, the decrease of NO oxidation activity in DOC due to PtOx formation and its impact on NOx conversion in SCR is quantified over the repeated driving cycles, showing 2-10% difference between the deNO(x) performance with the pre-reduced DOC and after few hours of operation under oxidizing conditions. Based on the simulation results, an improved configuration of the system is proposed that achieves up to 6% higher overall NOx conversion. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID NUMERICAL-SIMULATION; MTO PROCESS; MODEL; FLOW
AB In the methanol-to-olefins (MTO) process, coke deposition is closely related to the selectivity of light olefins. Previous simulations of different-sized MTO reactors using two-fluid model (TFM) combined with the EMMS (energy minimization multi-scale)-based drag well predict the hydrodynamic behaviors but poorly predict the product distribution of large reactors due to the unreasonable prediction in coke distribution. In this study, the TFM integrated with the EMMS-based drag is still employed, but the solid phase is treated as a mixture of a series of species with different coke contents. Because the coke content depends on the age of catalyst particles inside the reactor, a continuous stirred tank reactor (CSTR) model mimicking turbulent fluidization while considering the age distribution of catalysts is established to predict the initial coke distribution for speeding up simulation. Compared with the previous simulation without consideration of coke distribution, this approach increases the computational time by a factor of 36% and shows no influence on hydrodynamic predictions, but the reaction quantities such as methanol conversion, mass fractions of gaseous products and selectivity of light olefins, are better predicted.

AB Gas slip flow in micro- and nano- porous media with rough surfaces is investigated by the fractal geometry theory with a focus on the effect of surface roughness of capillaries. Based on the assumption that the pore size distribution of the porous media and rough elements of the wall surfaces of capillaries follow the fractal scaling law, apparent gas permeability and gas slippage factor are derived. According to the Klinkenberg equation, the key to the calculation of apparent gas permeability is the determination of gas slippage factor. In this paper, we established an analytical relationship between the gas slippage factor and the structural parameters of porous media. We first validated the model with available experimental data, then analyzed the effect of the relative roughness, porosity, the tortuosity fractal dimension and the pore fractal dimension on the gas slippage factor. With our fractal model, the physical mechanisms of gas slip flow are better elucidated. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Poor dispersity of filler particles always limits their application in mixed matrix membranes (MMMs), increasing the difficulties in membrane fabrication and restraining the full exploitation of the intrinsic separation ability of the fillers. Herein, polyethyleneimine (PEI), a functional branched polymer, was covalently bonded on the outer surface of CAU-1 nanoparticles to implement increased colloidal stability and improved CO2 affinity for MMMs preparation. As a result, the dispersity of CAU-1 particles in solvent and MMMs was greatly improved after surface functionalization. Meanwhile, the grafted PEI polymer chains can serve as CO2 carriers simultaneously, which benefits the CO2 transport in MMMs. The prepared MMMs based on modified CAU-1 exhibit largely improved CO2/CH4 separation performance, with a CO2 permeability of 546 Barrer and a CO2/CH4 separation factor of 27.8 at 30 wt% filler loading, showing 165% and 50% increases respectively compared with the pristine polymer membrane. The modification approach presented here is expected to extend the functionality of MOFs and facilitate the development of MMMs. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB A microwave-assisted method was developed for extraction of water-soluble fibroin from silkworm silk. In order to explore enhancing effect of microwave, dissolution profiles of silk fibroin were monitored by protein concentration measurements, showing a faster extraction rate of the microwave-assisted method compared to the conventional methods. Meanwhile, characterization of the resultant silk fibroin regenerated by the microwave-assisted method indicated similarity to that by the conventional methods in that they exhibited similar molecular weight ranges, secondary structures and gelation capabilities. In contrast to traditional microwave-assisted methods, this study employed a laboratory microwave reactor equipped with a feedback temperature control system, which enabled easy control and maintenance of certain reaction temperature and temperature distribution. In this way, the present study, to an extent, resolved possible concerns that uncontrollable extreme high temperature under microwave would cause degradation of the silk fibroin chain. This new microwave-assisted method has demonstrated its advantages of significant reduction in time-consuming and energy cost, and thus stands for a promising economical and efficient method for regeneration of silkworm silk fibroin.

AB Solute transport in a conduit (channel or tube) adjacent to a porous medium is drastically influenced by the porous walls. However, an appropriate relationship between the porous walls and the transport coefficients due to non-Newtonian fluid flows still needs further investigation. In this study, a reduced-order model for advective-dispersive transport due to flow of a non-Newtonian power-law (or Ostwald-de Waele) fluid in a conduit with porous walls is derived through which the dispersion coefficient can be obtained. It is revealed that the dispersion coefficient is controlled by the Peclet number and the flow behavior index. The dispersion coefficients for shear-thinning fluids are smaller than the case of Newtonian fluid while the dispersion coefficients for shear-thickening fluids are larger than that for Newtonian fluid. The ratio of dispersion coefficient in a conduit with porous walls to that in a conduit with non-porous walls recognizes three distinct transport regimes of diffusion-dominated, transition, and advection-dominated. The results exhibit that the exchange of solute between the conduit and the neighboring porous medium should be taken into consideration in determination of the dispersion coefficient for the last two transport regimes. It is also found that the larger the flow behavior index the earlier the breakthrough of a solute in a conduit with porous walls. In addition, the breakthrough time in a conduit with porous walls is larger than that in a conduit with non-porous walls. The presented results in this study are of great importance in many science and engineering applications, including drug delivery to blood vessels, separation of emulsions using membranes, nutrient uptake from soils, contaminant transport in fractured aquifers, and oil recovery from carbonate reservoirs.

TI Catalytic processing of non-condensable pyrolysis gas from plastics:

AB Non-condensable pyrolysis gas is a suitable source of hydrocarbons for energy applications. The purpose of this study was to develop a catalytic process for selective decomposition of unsaturated hydrocarbons in the pyrolysis gas as these species compromise the operation of gas engines, gas turbines and fuel cells. The effect of different calcium supports, namely CaCO3, Ca(OH)(2), CaO and their mixtures, on the performance of Ni-based catalytic sorbents during the decomposition of hydrocarbons and HCl sorption from non-condensable pyrolysis gas of mixed plastics was investigated. The plastic mixture containing low density polyethylene (40%), polypropylene (40%), polystyrene (10%) and polyvinyl chloride (10%) was initially pyrolyzed at 600 degrees C producing condensable oils and non-condensable gases. The non-condensable gases were further treated in a subsequent reactor at 700 degrees C in the presence of catalytic sorbents. All catalytic sorbents were effective for HCl sorption, decreasing the HCl concentration in the gas stream below detectable levels. However, the choice of calcium support had a substantial effect on the catalytic decomposition of hydrocarbons and the properties of produced carbon deposits. CaCO3, Ca(OH)(2) and their mixture at 1:1 ratio by mass loaded with Ni showed higher catalytic activity towards the decomposition of hydrocarbons compared to CaO and a mixture containing CaO, CaCO3 and Ca(OH)(2) at 1:1:1 ratio by mass. Furthermore, carbon deposits produced on the surface of Ni supported on CaCO3, Ca(OH)(2) and their mixture contained multi-walled carbon nanotubes, whereas carbon deposits produced on Ni supported on CaO and the mixture containing CaO had non-filamentous morphology. The observed results can be attributed to the low BET specific surface areas and pore volumes of CaO-containing catalytic sorbents which could limit the dispersion of Ni resulting in low catalytic activity.

AB This study concentrates on improving the low temperature performance of CDPF catalysts. The self-propagating high temperature combustion synthesis method was applied to synthesize a series of CeZrO2-delta, CuCeZrO2-delta, and MnCuCeZrO2-delta catalysts, which were coated on DPF substrate. The performance of the catalysts was fully investigated by the soot temperature programmed combustion, which showed that these catalysts with nanometer size have a high catalytic activity of soot combustion at low temperatures. Compared with Ce0.05Zr0.005O2-delta, Cu0.9Ce0.005Zr0.005O2-delta and Mn0.09Cu0.81Ce0.05Zr0.005O2-delta showed excellent low temperature soot oxidation activities and much higher CO2 selectivity. BET, XRD, TEM, and XPS were employed to characterize the structural and physical-chemical properties of catalysts. The XRD results indicated that catalysts with 90% Cu possess evenly distributed crystalline grains and small particle size, which is responsible for its excellent oxidation activity by providing more active sites as well as forming good connection between the catalyst and soot. The XPS results demonstrated that the Cux+ has a significant association with the formation of NO2, thus promoting the soot oxidation, and that the synergetic effect between Cux+ and Mnx+ contributes most to the improvement of the catalytic activity. The partial substitution with Mn could enhance the chemisorbed oxygen, which further improved NO oxidation and CO2 selectivity. Furthermore, the soot combustion reaction mechanism was examined with in situ DRIFTS. The results exhibited that the active sites of Cu0.9Ce0.05Zr0.05O2-delta and Mn0.09Cu0.81Ce0.05Zr0.05O2-delta could generate more reactive oxygen for NO oxidation and that the uniformly dispersed Cux+ and Mnx+ in Ce lattice could adsorb NO2 to form nitrite and nitrates, which behaved as a carrier of NO2 and transported it around the surface of soot, thus facilitating the soot combustion, especially at low temperatures.

AB Microreaction technology is an important technology for process intensification and high efficient chemical synthesis. The use of ionic liquids (ILs) as novel reaction media is another rapidly developing orientation for process intensification considering their strong dissolubility, low vapor pressure and adaptable physicochemical properties. The combination of the two technologies has been emerging fast in various applications, due to the ability to intensify the utility of ILs in microreactors. This review presents a summary of the recent progress on the transport and reaction processes with ILs in microreactors. A typical characteristic of ILs is their higher viscosity, so the effects of fluid viscosity on the hydrodynamics and mass transfer are highlighted. In addition, new correlations considering both shear and inertial forces are proposed to predict the flow regime transitions in a wide range of fluid viscosity. With respect to mass transfer, the unit cell model for Taylor flow is modified to represent the effect of viscosity on flow topology inside droplets/slugs. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB We derived a model to predict the concentration profile, or the center-of-mass distribution, of rod-like particles near a wall under shear flows. Various excluded volume mechanisms of a rod near a wall for each Peclet number (a ratio of shear rate and diffusivity) regime were incorporated into the model through a steric factor concept. At low and moderate Peclet numbers, the steric factor is mainly determined by the ratio of the restricted/unrestricted rod orientation distributions. However, at high Peclet number, the ratio between the rod penetration time in a depletion layer and the Jeffery orbit frequency mainly affects the steric factor. The predicted concentration profiles showed a good agreement with the results from previous works. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Ultrasmall gold nanoparticles were synthesized without strong capping agents by using a capillary-based continuous flow system. A mixture of gold(III) chloride trihydrate and trisodium citrate flowed through capillaries at elevated temperature. The effect of capillary material (polytetrafluoroethylene, fluorinated ethylene propylene, polyetheretherketone, fused silica), surface-to-volume ratio (capillary internal diameter 0.3-1 mm), average residence time (1.5-30 min) and temperature (70-100 degrees C) were investigated. At a flow rate of 0.006 ml/min (residence time 30 min), 100 degrees C, 275 kPa back pressure, citrate/gold molar ratio 3.15 and using PTFE capillary tubing with an inner diameter of 0.3 mm, very small (1.9 +/- 0.2 nm) nanoparticles were obtained. For comparison, experiments were also performed under the same experimental conditions, but in slug flow using octane as segmenting fluid, thus isolating the reactants from the tubing wall. The synthesized particles were 17.4 +/- 1.4 nm for segmented flow, demonstrating the important effect of the capillary wall surface. The performance of these citrate-capped gold nanoparticles was tested for Surface-Enhanced Raman Scattering (SERS). The average enhancement factor (AEF) of 2 nm gold nanoparticles capped by citrate from our work (AEF = 1.54 x 10(8)) was nearly double when compared to 2 nm phosphate-capped commercial gold nanoparticles (AEF = 7.34 x 10(7)). The adsorption of analyte molecules onto citrate-capped gold surface was easier due to the weaker binding strength of the carboxylate ligand and more hotspots formed with narrower gaps between neighbouring particles, giving rise to improved enhancement.

AB In our opinion, the thermally safe operating conditions for isoperibolic semibatch reactors (SBRs) should be characteristic of two terms: 1. conforming to QFS operating situation; 2. MTSR < MAT. Regretfully, the traditional boundary diagrams are only helpful for designing QFS operating conditions and can't predict the value of MTSR. Hence, the extended boundary diagrams have been developed in this work. Using these extended boundary diagrams, not only QFS operating conditions can be identified, but also MTSR can be predicted. In addition, the predicted MTSR is suggested to add up Delta tau(ta) before checking whether MTSR < MAT, because the value of UA at the end point of dosing period in a realistic case is lower than the ideal value of (UA)(0)(1 + epsilon). By this way conservative results will be obtained. Also, a procedure to identify thermally safe operating conditions for SBRs with the extended boundary diagrams is introduced in the last part.

AB Modeling morphological and hydraulic properties of thin porous media, such as filter layers and papers is highly relevant to various industries. In our previous studies, the X-ray tomography and FIB-SEM methods were applied to capture micro- and nano-scale pores in uncoated paper and coated layer, respectively. Here, the reconstructed pore structures were used to investigate two-phase water imbibition in these porous media. The obtained pore size distributions showed a log-normal probability density function. Such a distribution, together with concepts from critical path analysis and percolation theory, was applied to calculate relative permeability over a wide range of water saturations. Comparison with pore-scale numerical simulations showed the capability of this method to estimate water relative permeability for coated and uncoated papers. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB We perform Eulerian-Lagrangian simulations of solid-liquid flow in a mixing tank. The simulations are three-dimensional and time dependent and in the transitional flow regime. The lattice-Boltzmann method is used to solve the volume-averaged Navier-Stokes equations. The overall solids volume fraction is of the order of 10%. Situations with the solids only partly suspended are compared to those with fully suspended solids. The emphasis is on the effect of the particle size distribution (PSD) on the suspension behavior. Four PSD's all having the same d(32) were investigated. It is harder to fully suspend particles with wider size distribution as compared to narrow distributions. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Two-dimensional (2D) nanopore membranes play a pivotal role in the application of molecular separation, DNA sequencing, drug release and biosensing. Owing to their special properties including 2D symmetry and interfacial activity, amphiphilic nanosheets (ANs) have great potential for generating functional nanomaterials. In this work, the dissipative particle dynamics (DPD) simulations are employed to design 2D nanopore membranes with tunable size using AN molecules. We find that these two-dimensional membranes are much stable due to the double-layer assembled framework of the membrane with the thickness from 2.5 to 7.8 nm. Different sized nanopores ranging from 2.45 to 6.15 nm are also identified in the membrane architecture, which can be controlled by the concentration ratio, the length of grafting polymer and the affinity of ANs. Moreover, when at low concentration ratio (<10%), the ANs tend to form different core-shell structured micelles, including spherical, ellipsoidal and long rod-like self-assembled morphologies. From our study findings, the ANs could be extendedly used for drug delivery and release, multi-layer 2D nanomaterials by the advantage of their chemical tunability, including the affinity and stimulus-responsive properties of grafting polymer as well as the geometry of scaffold structure in the ANs.

AB The mass transfer from two spheres in tandem to an incompressible fluid flow accompanied by chemical reactions (first-order and second-order irreversible) into the fluid was analysed numerically. Creeping flow was assumed. The spheres have the same diameter, initial concentrations and physical properties. The concentration of the transferring species inside the spheres is considered: (1) constant and (2) spatially uniform and varying in time. The mathematical model equations were solved numerically in bispherical coordinates system. The computations focused on the conditions when the interaction between spheres does not influence the mass transfer rate. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB A systematic framework for optimal experimental design (OED) of multiple experimental factors is proposed to support data collection in chemical engineering systems with the purpose to obtain the most informative data for modeling. The structural identifiability is firstly investigated through a combined procedure with the generating series method and the identifiability tableau. Next the parameter estimability is analyzed via the orthogonalized sensitivity analysis in order to identify crucial and identifiable model parameters. Traditionally OED treats separate problems such as the choice of input conditions, the selection of variables to measure, and the design of sampling time profile. A new OED strategy is proposed that optimizes these interdependent factors in one framework. An iterative two-layer design structure is developed. In the lower layer for observation design, the sampling profile and the measurement set selection are combined and formulated as a single integrated observation design problem, which is relaxed to a convex optimization problem that can be solved with a local method. Thus the measurement set selection and the sampling profile can be determined simultaneously. In the upper layer for input design, the optimization of input intensities is obtained through stochastic global searching. In this way, the multi-factor optimization problem is solved through the integration of a stochastic method, for the upper layer, and a deterministic method, for the lower layer. Case studies are conducted on two biochemical systems with different complexities, one is an enzyme kinetically controlled synthesis system and the other one is a lab-scale enzymatic biodiesel production system. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of this iterative double-layer OED optimization strategy in reducing parameter estimation uncertainties compared with conventional approaches.

AB Reservoir heterogeneity is a serious problem for many mature oilfields. Due to heterogeneity, much of the displacing fluid may flow into the high permeability zones in the formation, leaving most of the low permeability areas un-swept, which leads to high water production and low oil recovery. In this work, oil-inwater (OW) emulsions were used as conformance control agents to reduce fluid flow of the high permeability zones in heterogeneous oil sands reservoirs. As well, for the first time, interfacial tension (IFT) effect on emulsion conformance control performance was studied. Emulsification tests were first performed to screen suitable emulsifiers which could be used to prepare stable O/W emulsions with different IFTs. Physiochemical properties of the emulsions were investigated by characterization tests in terms of their stability behavior, droplet size distribution and rheological properties.
   A series of heterogeneous parallel, dual-sandpack flow experiments were carried out to evaluate the profile control ability of emulsions with different IFTs of 0.04, 0.15, 0.92 and 5.20 mN/m in heterogeneous oil sands reservoirs. The results show that for the dual-sandpack models used in this study, emulsion conformance control performance gets better as IFT decreases from 5.20 mN/m to 0.15 mN/m, but it becomes worse as IFT further decreases to 0.04 mN/m. The fractional flow of the heterogeneous dual-sandpack diverts only once when flooded by an emulsion with an IFT of 5.20 mN/m. Emulsion with an IFT of 0.92 mN/m causes several flow diversions in the emulsion injection process, but the profile control ability could be destroyed by the flood of water. Emulsion with an IFT of 0.15 mN/m has good conformance control performance both at the emulsion flooding and subsequent water flooding stages, while emulsion with the least IFT of 0.04 mN/m shows very little profile control effect. The effect of emulsion slug size and sandpack permeability ratio on emulsion conformance control ability are also discussed in this paper. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

It deals with the uncertainty generated by the multivariate contribution plots and improves the diagnostic capacity by updating the BN with multiple likelihood evidence. It can diagnose the root cause of the process fault precisely as well as identify the fault propagation pathway. This methodology has been applied to the continuous stirred tank heater and the Tennessee Eastman chemical process for twelve fault scenarios. The result shows that it provides better diagnostic performance over conventional principal component analysis with hard evidence-based approaches. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Traditional data-driven modeling methods are unable to build easily interpretable process monitoring models because they ignore the useful process knowledge. This deficiency may decrease the fault detection and diagnosis capability. To correct this deficiency, a novel knowledge-data-integrated sparse modeling method is proposed for batch process monitoring. This method builds a knowledge-data-integrated sparse (KDIS) monitoring model by integrating process data with fundamental process knowledge. The KDIS model is well suited for fault detection and diagnosis due to its sparsity and good interpretability. Based on the KDIS model, two new monitoring indices are proposed for fault detection, and two-level contribution plots are developed for fault diagnosis. Two-level contribution plots can not only identify faulty variables but also faulty variable groups corresponding to control loops or physical/chemical links in the process. The effectiveness and advantages of the proposed methods are illustrated with a case study on an industrial-scale fed-batch fermentation process. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The main purpose of this article is to investigate the effects of pressure and temperature of incoming air into an evaporating chamber on fuel spray evaporation and fuel droplets characteristics. Before that, the influences of secondary break-up and coupling between droplets and gas phase on the present spray modeling are studied. An Eulerian-Lagrangian approach and two-way coupling model are implemented for modeling spray and atomization of liquid fuel in air. The SSTk - co turbulence model is applied to estimate eddy viscosity, whilst the discrete random walk model is employed to trace the droplets in a turbulent flow. With increasing inlet air temperature from 373 to 573 K, the lifetime and penetration depth of droplets are reduced by about 70% and 46%, respectively. The influence of incoming air pressure on droplets lifetime is not remarkable. The penetration of droplets is reduced by almost 61% while augmenting the air pressure from 1.0 to 10.0 atm.

AB Improper sizing of pipelines and production tubings in the petroleum industry is often caused by lack of understanding of three-phase flow, which is characterized by gas flowing together with an immiscible water-oil mixture. There is the presence of a continuous liquid phase and a liquid dispersed phase, as observed in liquid-liquid flows, i.e., one can observe either a dispersion or emulsion of oil in water (o/ w) or dispersion or emulsion of water in oil (w/o). The transition from o/w to w/o, or the other way around, is defined as phase-inversion. This phenomenon is characterized by a sharp increase in the pressure gradient, leading to significant pressure loss in the oil production system. The goal is to investigate the effects of oil viscosity, channel geometry (circular pipe or annular duct) and superficial gas velocity on the phenomenon of phase inversion in vertical liquid-liquid-gas flows, using oil with three different viscosities (ranging from 70 mPa s to 280 mPa s), tap water and compressed air as working fluids. The experiments were carried out in three different geometries: (i) glass pipe of 50 mm i.d., (ii) glass pipe of 95 mm i.d. and (iii) concentric annular duct with 95 mm of hydraulic diameter (glass outer pipe and PVC internal pipe). The experiments were performed under equivalent Reynolds number to evaluate the geometry effect. New data as total pressure gradient and volumetric fractions were obtained for all geometries. The results suggest that the extrapolation of results obtained in circular pipes with low viscosity oil and low gas flow rates to annular-duct flow with viscous oils and high gas flow rates can lead to significant errors.

AB The formation of nitrophenols by-products is still of major concern for the economics and environmental impact of the industrial process of benzene (Bz) nitration to mononitrobenzene (MNB) with mixed acid (sulphuric and nitric acids). The knowledge of nitrophenol (NP) distribution ratios in the liquid-liquid mixture (D-j, j = {NP}) is desirable for process optimization and for understanding the reaction mechanisms behind nitrophenols formation.
   In this study, a data-driven approach was implemented to provide prediction models for D-j of 2,4-dinitrophenol (DNP) and of 2,4,6-trinitrophenol (TNP) in a biphasic liquid system with a composition representative of the industrial processes. In the first step, screening tests were performed to identify the main variables influencing the experimental equilibrium weight fractions of nitrophenols in the aqueous phase (w(j,e)(A)). Subsequently two independent data sets were built for development and external validation of prediction multivariate linear regression (MLR) models, at 30 degrees C. The fitting results (R-2 and R-ad(2) >= 0.90) and the prediction results (R-pred,DNP(2) = 0.931, R-pred,TNP(2) = 0.908) confirmed the quality of the w(j,e)(A) models. Statistical significant predictive MLR models were also developed for D-j (which is related with w(j,e)(A)), at 30 degrees C, with DNP evidencing a higher affinity for the organic phase (i.e. D-DNP approximate to 2D(TNP)).

AB Toluene is a kind of volatile organic compounds usually present in industrial emissions. In this work, the rigorous model for species concentration distribution prediction proposed in part I was applied in simulating the biological degradation process of toluene in a bubble column (BC) reactor. We show in the present paper that the species concentration, turbulent mass diffusivity and velocity distributions in the bubble column bioreactor can be obtained simultaneously by applying the proposed model. On the basis of the simulations, the analogy between the turbulent mass diffusivity and turbulent viscosity for the bubble column reactor was investigated. The results showed that this analogy may depend on the rate of chemical or bio-chemical reaction in the bubble columns and remain for the case with a lower reaction rate. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Emulsification experiments have been carried out on a pilot-scale Model ACIP2 Sonolator liquid whistle device by examining the change in droplet size distributions of silicone oil in water emulsions, using SLES as a surfactant, before and after processing. The process variables considered were mass flow rate, pressure drop across Sonolator, oil viscosity (from 10 to 10,000 cSt), oil concentration (0.5-10 wt%), surfactant concentration (0.00003-0.5 wt%) and orifice size. All experiments were carried out in the turbulent flow regime. The oil phase was added as either a pure phase or as a pre-emulsion stabilised using SLES. The oil was injected just before the blade or mixed at a T-junction prior to the Sonolator; the pre-emulsion was exclusively introduced via the latter method. The resultant droplet size distributions were obtained from offline sampling using laser diffraction. The most significant parameters found to influence the drop size were found to be pressure drop, dispersed phase viscosity and surfactant (SLES) concentration, which formed the basis for an empirical power law correlation. Indices in this correlation were compared to findings in the literature for other emulsification devices, and to those predicted from the theories of droplet breakage in turbulent inertial flow. Despite an expected regime change from turbulent inertial to turbulent viscous break-up being common in the literature as the dispersed phase viscosity is increased, this phenomenon was not observed in the experimental data obtained, suggesting breakage in an intermediate regime.

AB The gas-solid dynamic behaviors in FCC feed injection zone are investigated by analyzing the solids holdup fluctuation signals. Four different phases are found during the mixing between jet and particles, i.e., the cluster phase, the denser dispersed particulate phase, the diluter dispersed particulate phase and the gas phase (without particles). The clusters in the feed jets-solids mixing zone are identified by combining wavelet decomposition with sensitivity analysis method. The time fractions of different phases in the upward and downward feed injection schemes are calculated to show the effects of different types of injections. Results show that the time fractions of cluster phase and gas phase are quite high in the feed influence zone of upward injection scheme. While low cluster and gas time fractions as well as high dispersed particulate time fraction are obtained when the injections are downward. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The molten steel temperature in ladle furnace is a significant variable, but it is hard to be measured by real-time detection, which has some bad effects on productions. Soft sensors are alternative and effective techniques to solve this issue. In this paper, the soft sensor of the molten steel temperature established by the Modified Maximum Entropy based Pruned Bootstrap Feature Subsets Ensemble (MMEP-BFSE) method is proposed. Although the Bootstrap Feature Subsets Ensemble (BFSE) temperature model is prominent in the precision and the forecasting speed on the large-scale and noisy data, its main drawback is too many sub-models required to combine, which is not always feasible for applications. To alleviate this drawback, the Modified Maximum Entropy based Pruning (MMEP) approach is presented, in which a subset of sub-models that better approximates the complete ensemble is find based on the maximum Renyi entropy and the trade-off parameter between the precision and the diversity of sub-models. Then, the soft sensor of the temperature based on the MMEP-BFSE is established on the practical data. Experiments show that the proposed soft sensor outperforms the others in the precision, and meets the precision requirements. Sub-models of the BFSE temperature model are substantially pruned with improved generalization by the MMEP approach. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB A focused experimental study describes fast cycling NOx storage and reduction (NSR) with H-2 and C3H6 as reductants on a Pt/BaO/CeO2/Al2O3 lean NOx trap (LNT) catalyst for emission control of lean burn vehicles. The results provide insight and deeper understanding of the impact of cycle frequency on the LNT performance and underlying NSR mechanism, with particular focus on whether a new NOx reduction pathway emerges when hydrocarbon reductant is used. Differentiation is made between two NOx conversion enhancement mechanisms-the conventional NSR mechanism with improved NOx storage utilization and a hydrocarbon-intermediate mechanism. A comparison of cycle-average NOx conversion using H-2 and C3H6 as reductants at the same lean/rich stoichiometry level provides revealing information. Both aerobic + anhydrous and anaerobic + anhydrous propylene-containing feeds enable an estimate of the contribution of H-2-generating water-gas shift and propylene steam reforming. The observed NOx conversion enhancement of up to 45% (absolute) with 10 x faster cycling is nearly independent of reductant type and is attributed to improved NOx storage utilization. Exothermic heat effects with temperature rise as high as 275 degrees C and significant temperature spatial gradients are encountered with H-2 during slow cycling, which makes H-2 an unexpectedly less effective reductant than C3H6. The hydrocarbon-intermediate pathway is shown to be responsible for a smaller fraction of the NOx conversion enhancement encountered during fast cycling. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Droplet breakup in an asymmetric bifurcation with two angled branches is studied experimentally and theoretically in this paper. In order to tune the droplet size and droplet velocity separately, a diluting channel is added and its influence on droplet generation is confirmed to be negligible. The underlying physics of the droplet generation is revealed as compared with other works. Effects of the droplet parameters, including the initial droplet length and the droplet velocity, on breakup characteristics are analyzed. The regime diagram of the droplet breakup and the critical conditions between different regimes are provided. It is found that the splitting ratio is largely influenced by the initial droplet length and the droplet velocity, which indicates that the breakup process is an inter-dependent process between the splitting junction and droplets themselves. At last, a simple but effective prediction model is constructed by considering the hydrodynamic resistance of the branches with the presence of the daughter droplets, which also proves the similar motion of the droplets with low viscosity ratio of the two liquids and the bubble.

AB Numerous practical applications of the Discrete Element Method (DEM) require a flexible description of particles that can account for irregular and non-convex particle shape features. Capturing the particle non-convexity is important since it allows to model the physical interlocking when the particles are in contact. To that end, the most flexible approach to capture the particle shape is via a polyhedron, which provides a faceted representation of any shape, albeit at a significant computational cost. In this study we present a decomposition approach to modeling non-convex polyhedral particles as an extension of an existing open source convex polyhedral discrete element code, BlazeDEM-GPU, which computes using general purpose graphical processing units (GPGPUs). Although the principle of decomposition of non-convex particles into convex particles is not new, its application by the discrete element modeling community has been rather limited. The non-convex extension of BlazeDEM-GPU was validated using a hopper flow experiment with identical convex and identical non-convex 3D printed particles. The experiment was designed around two sensitive flow points, with the convex particles following the intermittent flow and the non-convex particles forming stable arches. It was demonstrated that the DEM simulations can be applied to reproduce both the convex and the non-convex flow behavior using the same parameter set. This study is a significant step towards general computing of non-convex particles for industrial-scale applications using the GPGPUs. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Two-dimensional nanoporous membranes have recently attracted great attention in osmosis-related applications due to their high water permeability and salt rejection. The size distribution of the pores on the membrane is closely related to these properties. Circular pores have been the main subject of research. Recently, it was found that the water permeability of a slit pore can be much higher than that of a circular pore, with the same salt rejection. Hence, it is necessary to discuss the osmotic flow through these pores at the nanoscale. In widely used models, two solute parameters are always used to quantify the ability to produce osmotic pressure and the probability of being rejected by the membrane. These are always assumed to have the same value and thus are both called reflection coefficients. However, this assumption is found to be inconsistent with the experimental results when describing osmosis on this scale. In this work, we discuss osmosis through a slit by making an analogy between the solute and the ideal gas molecules in the dilute solution. Expressions for the two reflection coefficients are derived based on the geometrical relationship between the solute and the slit. We find that the two coefficients increase with the size of the solute. Their values are not equal, as found in previous experiments. Extensive molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are performed and a good correlation between the simulation results and our predictions is found. This work may help to understand the osmotic flow through nanoscale pores and enable the design of highly efficient nanopores on membranes in osmosis-related applications. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB In gas-solid flows, the drag force experienced by solid particles plays a significant role in determining the fluid dynamics of the system. Although several drag models have been proposed over the years, Gidaspow (1994) and Beetstra (2007) models are the ones that are still most commonly used. There is a lack of availability of work that gauges the capabilities of the newer models that have been developed over the past decade. Hence, this work utilizes three experimental configurations of fluidized beds to compare the performance of recent drag models proposed by Cello et al. (2010), Tenneti et al. (2011), Rong et al. (2013), Tang et al. (2016), and compares them with the drag models by Gidaspow (1994) and Beetstra et al. (2007). Euler-Euler (EE) or Two Fluid Model (TFM) simulations have been conducted for mono-disperse gas-solid fluidized beds containing Geldart-D particles corresponding to two experimental configurations and Geldart-B particles corresponding to one experimental configuration; all these configurations have been found in the literature. The temporal evolution of the ensemble-averaged particle height, time-averaged vertical particle velocity, temporal variation of the bubble diameter, time-averaged void-fraction distribution across the bed, and the time taken for computation are used as the variables for comparisons. It is observed that the drag models by Tenneti et al. (2011), Rong et al. (2013), and Gidaspow (1994) ensure appreciable performance for Geldart-D particles; for Geldart-B particles, the models by Tenneti et al. (2011) and Gidaspow (1994) exhibit satisfactory performance. The models by Beetstra et al. (2007) and Cello et al. (2010) are able to give appreciable performance only in predicting the bubble evolution, and even that at very early time instants, when the maximum solid volume fraction in the bed is about 0.60 (which is smaller than the maximum packing limit of 0.63). Taking both the computational time and solution accuracy into consideration, the model by Tenneti et al. (2011) seems to be the optimal choice for the considered cases, which is closely followed by the model of Gidaspow et al. (1994). The User Defined Functions (UDFs) and another code used for this work are included as Supplementary/Supporting Material. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Dynamics for droplet breakup with tunnels and formation of satellite droplets in a symmetric microfluidic T-junction are investigated using a high-speed digital camera. The breakup process of droplet could be divided into four sequential stages: squeezing, transition, pinch-off, and thread rupture stages. Effects of the viscosity ratio of both phases lambda, the capillary number of the continuous phase Ca-c, and the dimensionless droplet length l(0)/w(c) on the breakup process of droplet are analyzed. In the squeezing stage controlled by squeezing pressure, the variation of the minimum width of the droplet neck with time could be scaled as a power-law relationship with exponent related to lambda and l(0)/w(c). The transition stage is dominated by the velocity of the fluid, and the pinch-off stage is mainly driven by the capillary force. For these two stages, the evolution of the minimum width of the droplet neck with the remaining time could be described as other power-law relationship with exponent related to lambda. In the thread rupture stage controlled by viscous stresses of both phases and the surface tension, the minimum width of droplet neck decreases linearly with time, and the coefficient of the linear function depends on lambda. Additionally, for the formation of satellite droplets, the size of satellite droplet increases with the increase of superficial velocity of the fluid and droplet viscosity. Furthermore, a critical capillary number 0.03 is observed in low viscosity of the droplet, which divides the variation of the size of the main satellite droplet with the capillary number into constant area and growth zone.

AB Thermal runaways can have a significant impact on the performance and normal operation of reaction processes, causing safety issues and financial loss, which hinder the intensification of such processes. More specifically, a control system that does not possess proper detection mechanisms of the boundary of stability will by necessity be overly conservative. This leads to poorer performance and the inability to intensify the process, i.e. to reduce process times for example and also to achieve higher yields.
   For the intensification of batch processes a stability criterion, based on the divergence criterion, is presented. The derivation of the stability criterion and a comparison to the original divergence criterion is shown for several batch reactions. It is shown that the stability criterion classifies the system behaviour more reliably for the case studies considered. This stability criterion is embedded in Model Predictive Control, which is a novel control scheme. This scheme allows the controlled increase of the reaction temperature while keeping the processes in a stable region, hence reducing the risk of thermal runaways. This control system enables batch processes to achieve a target conversion in a reduced completion time of reaction and an intensification of batch processes. (C) 2018 The Authors.

AB Evolution of alumina catalyst texture during macromolecule conversion with an emphasis on heavy oil hydroprocessing was theoretically estimated using geometrical characteristics of the porous media that were in turn calculated via Monte-Carlo methods and methods of the graph theory. Two types of alumina texture have been modeled: unimodal mesoporous structure of conventional catalyst and bimodal meso-macroporous structure of the catalyst, which can be prepared by hard-templating method. To estimate the decreasing of the effectiveness coefficient for these two types of catalysts, a solution for the diffusion equation on the cylinder pellet was found. Deactivation was modeled by the most simple way of monotonic increase of alumina grain radius, which represented deposition of coke and metal species onto the surface of grains. The comparison of theoretical predictions with experimental results on heavy oil conversion under conditions close to industrial ones showed the correlation between the experiment and the model - hierarchical texture prolonged the catalyst lifetime in both cases. Nevertheless, to obtain accurate predictions of the necessary properties of the catalyst texture, the deactivation model should be complicated. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In the second part of this study, we present the stochastic weighted particle population balance framework used to solve the twin-screw granulation model detailed in the first part of this study. Each stochastic jump process is presented in detail, including a new nucleation jump event capable of capturing the immersion nucleation processes in twin-screw granulation. A variable weighted inception algorithm is presented and demonstrated to reduce the computational cost of simulations by up to two orders of magnitude over traditional approaches. The relationship between the performance of the simulation algorithm and key numerical parameters within the nucleation jump process are explored and optimum operating conditions are identified. Finally, convergence studies on the complete simulation algorithm demonstrate that the algorithm is very robust against changes in the number of stochastic particles used, provided that the number of particles exceeds a minimum required for numerical stability.

AB In recent years, single-use bioreactors have been increasingly used in the pharmaceutical industry. However, no direct comparison between single-use and resuable bioreactors have been done at industrial scale.
   So, the aim of this work is to critically compare hydrodynamics in a Cultibag STR (SUB) and a reusable bioreactor (SSB). The operating conditions and comparison criteria have been chosen in relation to adherent cell cultures.
   The flow structure and the spatial distribution of mechanical stress were characterized using CFD. A CFD-based compartment model was used to compare mixing and, finally, the trajectories of several particles was simulated with a stochastic model to obtain circulation and residence time distributions in zones of high mechanical stress.
   Significant differences in terms of hydrodynamics are observed between the two bioreactors. Because of the absence of baffles, the flow in the single-use bioreactor is highly tangential compared to the SSB. As a consequence, the mixing time in the SUB is 2.5 times longer.
   In the case of adherent animal cell cultures, mechanical stress is usually considered as the main limiting factor related to hydrodynamics. So, the spatial and temporal distribution of mechanical stress have been compared. The results show that the cells grown in the SUB bioreactor will be not only more frequently exposed to high mechanical stress, but also over a longer period. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB We present a novel recurrence CFD (rCFD) method for the efficient simulation of passive scalar transport in pseudo-periodic flows.
   rCFD transfers full CFD(-DEM) simulations into a purely Lagrangian description of scalar transport by evaluating trajectories of fluid tracers and discrete particles. These trajectories are subsequently converted into cell to cell shift operations, resulting in data shift pattern on a computational grid. Finally, a recurrence process, based on the statistics of the full CFD(-DEM) simulation, controls the sequence of consecutive frames of data shift patterns.
   First, we applied rCFD to species transport in single-phase large eddy simulations, yielding excellent agreement with corresponding full CFD simulations. Second, we addressed heat transfer in a bubbling fluidized bed, yielding acceptable agreement with corresponding CFD-DEM simulations. In both cases, simulation times were reduced by more than four orders of magnitude without losing spatial resolution, resulting in faster than real-time simulations.
   Subsequently, we discuss existing model limitations such as (i) process periodicity, (ii) passiveness of transport, (iii) data storage requirements and (iv) physical diffusion and sketch possible future remedies. Concluding, we consider rCFD a promising bridging technology between full CFD simulations and online process prediction. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Membrane distillation (MD) is considered as a key technology for desalination applications. It shows indeed numerous advantages compared to reverse osmosis and other desalination processes (e.g. thermal driving force, no osmotic pressure effect on membrane fluxes). Nevertheless, this technology still presents some issues, most notably due to pore wetting effects. This study proposes the use of a thin, self-standing dense membrane in place of microporous materials as a solution to avoid wetting in MD for water desalination. In a first step, a membrane contactor model is developed based on mass and energy balances and the simulations are validated using experimental results obtained on hollow fiber modules with microporous membranes. A comparative performance analysis is then achieved between a porous and a dense membrane module. A parametric study on the influence of dense membrane thickness and water permeability shows that a two fold increase in water flux, without significant impact on energy efficiency, is potentially achievable with thin and permeable dense materials compared to microporous membranes. Guidelines for the design of high-performance dense membrane modules for MD are finally proposed. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Heat transfer studies were carried out in packed-beds (PBs) heated by the wall and percolated by low air flow rates. Porous media were composed by particles of sugarcane bagasse (SCB) and by a mixture of particles of SCB, orange pulp and peel (OPP) and wheat bran (WB) at proportion SCB:OPP: WB 1:2:2 w/w (composed medium), agricultural waste used as substrates in bioreactors of solid-state fermentation (SSF), an interesting biotechnological application of PBs. Once metabolic heat generated has to be dissipated, heat transfer studies and thermal parameters are required. Tube-to-particle diameter ratio was D/d(p) = 260, bed height ranged from L = 60 to 180 mm, while air flow rate ranged from 400 to 1200 L/h. Air temperature was 40 degrees C and wall temperature 65 degrees C. The outlet bed temperatures (T-L) were measured by ring-shaped sensors and by aligned thermocouples. Average temperatures (T-avg) and global heat transfer coefficients (U) were calculated separately for central region of the beds and for wall-vicinity. Radial effective thermal conductivity (Lambda(r)) and wall-to-fluid convective heat transfer coefficient (alpha(wall)) have been estimated by means of the traditional two-parameters model. Radial temperature profiles at bed outlet were flattened in the central region and convergent at the edge of the packs. The two-regions approximation for U calculations showed to be appropriate for both packs. Global coefficient U, thermal conductivity Lambda(r) and convective coefficient alpha(wall) increased with increasing air flow rate and decreased with bed height. Lambda(r) tended to the stagnant value of the thermal conductivity and alpha(wall) were lower than 50 W/m(2)/degrees C, addressing the difficulty on removing metabolic heat from PBs of SSF.

AB Defoaming of foam drilling fluid on the ground is the key to its cyclic utilization. This paper proposes a novel mechanical foam breaker based on self-oscillation to promote the application of foam drilling technology. Simulation results showed that the combined effects of the negative pressure, collision, extrusion, and shear generated in the cavity cause the foam to fracture. A prototype was developed, and the effects of the structural parameters, components of the foam drilling fluid, cuttings, and temperature on the defoaming percentage were investigated in experiments. The experimental results showed that the diameter of the upper nozzle was the major structural factor influencing the defoaming. A smaller diameter for the upper nozzle resulted in a higher defoaming percentage. The defoaming percentage first increased and then decreased with increases in the lower nozzle diameter, cavity length, and diameter, which indicated that there is an optimum structure for the foam breaker. The cutting concentration and temperature could improve the defoaming percentage to some extent, and the salts had a minor influence on the defoaming percentage. The results verified the feasibility and advantages of using the mechanical foam breaker and laid a solid theoretical foundation for its application in petroleum and natural gas drilling.

AB We have used a time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) to study molecular transport in graphene oxide membranes (GOMs)/graphene membranes (GMs) with offset angle disordering. We have demonstrated that slight disordering of the GOMs/GMs is favorable to molecular transport, and may affect the diffusion selectivity. This phenomenon can be further understood by considering microscopic properties such as the local flux distribution. The maximum of the local flux is located at the edge of the graphene sheet, which could explain previous simulation findings. Additionally, the time-dependent properties have also been examined. A large offset angle in the GOM/GMs seems to be a favorable factor in the initial stage of the transport, but becomes unfavorable when the transport reaches a stable state. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The set pressure in pressure relief valves (PRVs) varying with the type of sealed medium has been a puzzling problem in the field of chemical machinery and equipment for many years. Here we propose a novel viewpoint to interpret this phenomenon, by which the set pressure difference is ascribed to the additional adsorption pressure of sealed medium adsorbed in the intrinsic nanoscale apertures of PRVs. To demonstrate, two individual types of medium gases (i.e., saturated steam and air) sealed in different PRVs are investigated, and upon a multiscale model of the apertures in PRVs, the additional adsorption pressures are evaluated by using classical density functional theory (DFT). Our calculation shows that the adsorption force of steam is always higher than that of air, resulting in a lower set pressure disregarding the use of different PRVs. The theoretical results are compared with the experimental measurements, displaying qualitatively good agreement, which supports our surmise. Finally, possible solution to reduce the set pressure difference is discussed. This work cast helpful insights for the design and application of PRVs. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In this study, sound emission in subcooled pool boiling with a small plate heater was investigated experimentally. Acoustic signals were recorded using a hydrophone and analyzed using sound pressure level (SPL), fast Fourier transform, and discrete wavelet transform (DWT). The results show that the SPL combined with an analysis of the sound signal by DWT can be used to identify boiling modes and heat transfer intensification. In contrast to those for a large plate heater or long wire, the plot of the SPL against wall superheat in nucleate boiling region exhibits an 'N" shape. Visualization results indicate that this difference mainly originates from the effects of heater size on bubble growth and departure. Compared with the nucleate boiling, in the region of microbubble emission boiling (MEB), the SPL exhibits a step increase of 10-20 dB, and continues to increase with the further increase of the heat flux. A comparison of the bubble frequency and features of the acoustic signals shows that the loud boiling sound in the MEB could be mainly attributed to the vapor film collapse and vapor volume oscillations, which also significantly affect the heat transfer process.

AB Aerated stirred tank reactors are widely used in chemical industry and bioprocess engineering. One major parameter to characterize the heat-and mass transfer performance of such aerated stirred tank reactors is the mixing time necessary to homogenize the reactor volume. Despite its importance, the prediction of the mixing time is still challenging due to the complex hydrodynamic inhomogeneities induced by the gaseous phase, which becomes strongly apparent in large scale systems. A precise measurement of the two phase flow on the other hand requires a volumetric insight and is thus difficult to realize. To overcome this problem a transparent stirred tank reactor on industrial scale has been erected at the Hamburg University of Technology in cooperation with Boehringer Ingelheim Pharma GmbH & Co.KG. With the decolouration method the temporal and spatial development of mixing can be taken into account. The results indicate the importance of the local inhomogeneities on large scale. A first characterization can be done by taking into account buoyancy driven flows superimposing the flow imposed by the impeller. A correlation is presented to estimate the transition between a loading and flooding regime on large scale. This correlation enables the calculation of mixing times for a wide range of stirrer frequencies and superficial gas velocities. Furthermore, this publication emphasizes the challenges of scale-up on the basis of laboratory experiments in small scale. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In this work we present a novel four-dimensional, stochastic population balance model for twin-screw granulation. The model uses a compartmental framework to reflect changes in mechanistic rates between different screw element geometries. This allows us to capture the evolution of the material along the barrel length. The predictive power of the model is assessed across a range of liquid-solid feed ratios through comparison with experimental particle size distributions. The model results show a qualitative agreement with experimental trends and a number of areas for model improvement are discussed. A sensitivity analysis is carried out to assess the effect of key operating variables and model parameters on the simulated product particle size distribution. The stochastic treatment of the model allows the particle description to be readily extended to track more complex particle properties and their transformations. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB This paper presents systematic image processing methods for investigating hydrodynamic characteristics in a rectangular spouted bed (30.2 mm x 101.6 mm). The objective is to provide a non-intrusive technique to determine the bed expansion ratio, the jet height and the fountain height due to their significant influence on the hydrodynamics of the entire bed. A high-speed video camera is used in the experiment with Geldart D particles as the bed material. After the image acquisition, image denoising, thresholding, logical and mask operations are applied correspondingly for the boundary discrimination, based on which an algorithm has been developed to determine the bed height successfully. With the discriminated boundary, morphological operations viz. erosion and dilation have been used to accurately determine the jet height and the fountain height. The feasibility of the technique is proven through profiles of bed expansion ratio, jet height and fountain height under three initial bed heights (0.0762 m, 0.102 m, and 0.127 m) for two different nozzle sizes (0.0096 m and 0.0127 m). Depending on the determination of the hydrodynamic characteristics, different flow regimes can be distinguished comprehensively through profiles of the bed expansion ratio and bed pressure drop in combination with the standard deviation of jet/fountain height. The proposed flow regime discrimination verifies the feasibility and effectiveness of the image processing methods in assessing the solids behavior in the spouted beds. Results about the variation of the jet height and the fountain height under current operating conditions as determined by the new technique are also discussed.

AB In most heat transfer applications, knowledge of the viscosity variation is important. Thus viscosity correction factors have been researched and proposed for almost a century. One of the most successful relations was reported by Sieder-Tate in 1936, which has been widely used in engineering analysis and design. In this study, we have improved on the Sieder-Tate relation, following a classical theoretical analysis of the thermal boundary layer. An exact solution to the viscosity correction factor was obtained which shows that the Sieder-Tate correction factor over-predicts the heat transfer coefficient in the case of cold wall (cooling) and does not hold properly for hot wall (heating). We have found that a relation of (mu(infinity)/mu(w))(0.254) (in case of cooling) and (mu(infinity)/mu(w))(0.087) in the case of heating is better than the Sieder-Tate factor of (mu(infinity)/mu(w))(0.14) (uniformly applied to both the heating and cooling cases). Here mu(infinity) and mu(w) are the bulk and wall viscosity coefficients respectively. The theoretical analysis also shows that the above correction factors are limited to small values of ln (mu(w)/mu(infinity)) (for cold wall) and ln (mu(infinity)/mu(w)) (for hot wall). However a general solution has been obtained and the correlation developed by Petukhov (1970) closely matches the exact solution for the case of cold wall cooling of a fluid. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Particle resuspension in a fully developed turbulent square duct flow is simulated using one-way coupled large eddy simulation coupled with a Lagrangian particle tracking technique for a range of bulk Reynolds numbers (36.5 k, 83 k and 250 k) and four particle sizes ranging from 5 to 500 mu m (St = 0.01-2415) considered. Results obtained for the single-phase flow show good agreement with experimental data. Predictions of the time-dependent particle-laden flows demonstrate that the secondary flow mainly dominates particle resuspension in the regions near the center and sidewalls of the duct. It is found that particle resuspension decreases with particle size. The smaller particles tend to be more prone to resuspension, and are resuspended for a longer duration than larger particles. The mean particle resuspension velocity is found to increase with the duct height. In addition, particle resuspension in the vertical direction increases with Reynolds number while the effect of particle size on particle resuspension decreases. The resuspension rate in the spanwise direction fluctuates more as the Reynolds number increases. It is also found that the average particle resuspension rate in the lower half of the duct is always close to 0.5, and is independent of time, particle size and Reynolds number. Based on a dynamic analysis, the drag force is found to dominate the resuspension of small particles, while the lift force tends to dominate particle resuspension with increasing particle size. For low Reynolds number (36.5 k and 83 k) flows, the drag force plays an important role in the upper regions of the lower half of the duct, but the lift force dominates particle behavior in the lower regions. It can be concluded that the effects of duct height on particle behavior decline significantly with Reynolds number. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB We herein propose a highly efficient technology for the synthesis of cyclohexanone oxime, a key intermediate for the production of caprolactam. The classical cyclohexanone ammoximation over TS-1 catalyst needs t-butanol as the organic solvent to change the reaction system from liquid-liquid-solid to liquid-solid for much better reaction performances, which greatly increases the reactor size and the downstream separation cost. In this work, a solvent-free liquid-liquid-solid heterogeneous reaction was successfully implemented in a microreaction system containing two T-junction microreactors. The effects of temperature, pressure, residence time, concentrations of reactants and catalyst on the reaction performance were systematically investigated. This developed technology resulted in a 99.87% conversion of cyclohexanone and nearly 100% selectivity to cyclohexanone oxime within 3 min. These results indicate that the new process could provide a more environmental friendly and economic approach to caprolactam industry. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Poly ether block amide (PEBA) incorporated with zeolite 13X nanoporous was deposited onto a PSf/PE layer. The fabricated Mixed Matrix Composite Membranes (MMCMs) were weighed up by XRD, SEM, FTIR and AFM analysis. The influence of PEBA concentration, number of coated layers, zeolite loading, PDMS cover layer and a set of conditions for operating a particular process on the gas separation performance of the fabricated membranes were specified through pure gases permeability examination. The best CO2 permeability and CO2/N-2 and CO2/CH4 selectivity for the MMCM loaded with 1 wt% zeolite 13X showed an increase in 200%, 1030% and 3633% compared to the neat membrane. CO2/N-2 and CO2/CH4 selectivity increased 153% and 18.24%, after coating a PDMS cover layer on the PEBA-zeolite (1%)/PSf/PE, respectively. Molecular dynamics (MD) and Grand Canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) have been performed to reckon the influence of PEBA and zeolite 13X contents on gas separation and thermodynamic properties. Four different Neat and MMMs were constructed in simulation part regarding the incorporation of 0, 0.5, 1 and 2 wt% of zeolite nano-fillers. Fractional free volume (FFV), Density, X-ray diffraction (XRD) and radial distribution function (RDF) were performed to understand the nanostructure properties of the membranes. Having used three different gases (N-2, CO2 and CH4), the permeability and selectivity of constructed membranes have been studied. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB A novel approach for the determination of a kinetic model of enzyme deactivation is presented incorporating time and temperature dependence into a single, continuous assay. A generic method for a non-isothermal, continuous activity assay is developed. Unique temperature profiles that enhance model discrimination with fewer experiments compared to linear temperature scans were used to differentiate kinetic models of penicillin G acylase (PGA) deactivation. Three models are examined in depth but the technique is generalizable to any kinetic deactivation model. Using the Akaike information criterion (AIC), the Lumry-Eyring model was found to best capture PGA deactivation behavior and the corresponding kinetic parameters are presented for the first time. Additionally, simulated experiments on lysozyme and TEM-1 beta-lactamase were used to develop temperature profiles that best differentiate the studied kinetic models. The results from the proposed approach were consistent with conventional, but tedious, isothermal batch experiments. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This work reports theoretical studies of flow behaviour in a monolith outlet zone for different Reynolds numbers covering laminar and transitional/turbulent flow regimes. Monolith type substrate is the core part of the automotive catalytic converter. Due to computational limitations, most numerical models of the converter represent the monolith as a continuum, averaging the effect of the solid and the open space on the flow. This strategy is useful to study the macro-structure of the flow, however, it does not capture the exact behaviour of an actual honeycomb type structure, especially at its entrance and exit. In this work, which is a continuation of the publication by Cornejo et al. (2018), a series of 3D LES and RANS simulations are performed using different discrete channel geometry to study and quantify the velocity fluctuations of flow leaving a monolith. The results show that above a certain Reynolds number the instability of the flow after the monolith is significant, leading to turbulence generation. The velocity fluctuations are mainly explained by the flow past the outlet of the monolith, and their magnitude is related to the Reynolds number based on the thickness of the walls between channels. An expression for this critical Reynolds number has been designed and verified against numerical simulations. Parametric studies are carried out to illustrate the influence of the Reynolds number on the appearance of flow fluctuations at the outlet zone of the monolith. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The excess Gibbs free energy-equation of state (G(E) EoS) models is presented based on the Peng-Robinson (PR) EoS combined with the Wong-Sandler (WS) mixing rule and the modified UNIFAC group contribution method (PR-WS-MUNIFAC). The average absolute deviation (AAD) of vapor phase mass fraction and the absolute average relative deviation (AARD) of pressure are 0.0047 and 0.53%, respectively, for R152a + R1234yf; 0.0064. 0.0050 and 1.59%, respectively, for R32 + R125 + R134a. The VLE properties of the ternary mixture R1234yf + R290 + R134a as a drop-in replacement for R134a were predicted over the temperature range of (253.15-313.15 K) at 10 K intervals. The vapor-liquid-liquid equilibrium (VLLE) was qualitatively analyzed in theory, and the relevant phase equilibrium diagrams were constructed. The R290 + R134a system has clear characteristics of VLLE near the azeotropic point; the pressure of the upper critical end point (UCEP) is approximately 1.627 MPa. Liquid phase separation also exists in the ternary system of R1234yf + R290 + R134a. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB We demonstrate that refinery-grade propane/propylene mixtures, rather than polymer-grade propylene, can be used for industrial propylene hydroformylation with Rh/BiPhePhos catalyst complexes. Because propylene hydroformylation is selective, an enriched propane stream is produced, which may be recycled for producing more propylene. In addition to the potential energy savings and associated economic/environmental benefits, the mixed propane/propylene feed also provides reaction benefits by volumetrically expanding the reaction mixture to yield gas-expanded liquids (GXLs) with tunable physicochemical properties. Unlike conventional reaction media, the H-2/CO ratio in GXL media can be enhanced by simply increasing the partial pressure of propane. For rhodium/triphenylphosphine catalyzed propylene hydroformylation in propane-expanded liquids, performed between 343.15 K and 363.15 K and pressures up to 2.0 MPa, the n/i aldehyde ratio is increased by up to 45% (corresponding to an increase in n-aldehyde selectivity from 71% to 78%). This is attributed to the increased H-2/CO ratio in the GXL phase. At identical operating conditions, such enhancements are not seen in the case of bidentate ligands wherein electronic effects likely exert more influence on the n/i ratio. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB This work applies computational fluid dynamics (CFD) modelling to a novel 1000 L design of single-use-technology (SUT) bioreactor, with a magnetically driven floor-mounted impeller and spargers distributed across the tank floor. A two-phase Euler-Euler model using the k-epsilon turbulence model and population balance is presented alongside the use of immersed solid method for modelling the impeller motion. This work also provides the first CFD analysis of a large-scale SUT bioreactor, identifying key flow characteristics of the non-standard design at different operating conditions. Five models for the mass transfer coefficient, k(L), are compared, with k(L)a values compared to experimental measurements. The slip velocity model is found to be the best prediction of the mass transfer coefficient for this SUT system. Separating the influence of the mass transfer coefficient and specific area, a shows that the latter is the dominant driving force behind changes in k(L)a that occur at different operating conditions. Comparing the present work to previous studies for traditional stirred tanks highlights the need for understanding the hydrodynamics of non-standard reactor designs when identifying suitable mass transfer models in gas-liquid flow systems.

AB The application of surfactants in enhanced oil recovery (EOR) processes aids in reducing interfacial tension at the oil-aqueous interface as well as altering the wetting nature of the reservoir rock. However, most commercial surfactants used in the petroleum industry are expensive. In an attempt to solve this issue, an anionic surfactant was synthesized from coconut oil as an alternative during oil recovery. The synthesized sodium ethyl ester sulfonate (SEES) surfactant was characterized by FT-IR, H-1 NMR and TGA analyses. The critical micelle concentration (CMC) values of SEES surfactant were determined at different temperatures by electrical conductivity method. The interfacial tension (IFT) at the oil-aqueous interface was found to reduce to ultra-low magnitudes in the presence of salt. Alkali addition also plays a synergistic role in IFT reduction ability of SEES solutions. Surfactant solutions exhibited good salt tolerance levels and long-term thermal stability. SEES surfactant also showed improved wettability alteration property, changing the nature of oil-aged rock from intermediate-wet to water-wet. Synergism in wetting characteristics of SEES solution is achieved by salt addition. Additional recoveries of 20.05% was attained in the presence of 0.80 wt% SEES only, which further increased to 33.49% and 34.79% by the addition of 0.01% and 0.02% PHPA polymer respectively.

AB In this work the problem of permeation of an oil droplet through a cascade of pore bodies and pore openings is investigated. When the oil droplet becomes totally within the pore cascade, it is called an oil ganglion. The cascade is considered composed of spherical pore bodies and cylindrical pore throats. The capillary entry pressure in relation to the applied pressure difference determines whether the oil ganglion will move or get trapped. Several cases are considered including the case when the leading part of the oil droplet is inside the cascade and the receding part is at the surface, the case when both the interfaces are within pore throats, the case when the two interfaces are within pore bodies, and the case when one interface is in a pore throat and the other is in the pore body. An algebraic equation has been developed to determine the entry pressure when part of the droplet is still at the surface of the cascade. This formula reduces to that found in literature when the whole droplet pins at the surface. This provides confidence in the developed relationship and the modeling approach. The entry pressure associated with all these cases is determined. Several examples have been considered to show how the critical entry pressure may vary throughout the cascade. It is found that, the influence of the receding part of the droplet at the surface of the membrane is not significant on the entry pressure formula. In other words, one can use the critical pressure formula associated with the leading interface to determine the breakthrough through the different parts of the cascade. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB With the promising potential in non-contact fluid manipulation, the photothermally induced phase change along with the interfacial behaviors have been frequently applied in various microfluidic devices. The property of the working fluid greatly affects the photothermal conversion and thus phase change behaviors. For this reason, the IR laser induced phase change of the NaCl solution in the microchannel was visually studied and compared with distilled water in this work. Experimental results indicated that the NaCl solution exhibited the distinct phase change behaviors. The existence of dissolved ions could weaken the photothermal conversion, leading to lowered temperature rise and evaporation rate as compared to the distilled water. In particular, different from the distilled water, the condensed droplets were formed at the region relatively far away from the evaporating interface due to lower evaporation rate. No coalescence between the condensed droplets and liquid slug was observed. Besides, the effects of the NaCl concentration, laser power and spot position were also investigated. It was found that higher NaCl concentration resulted in lower temperature rise and evaporation rate. With the increase of the input laser power and the decrease of the distance between the laser spot and the interface, the temperature rise and evaporation rate could be improved. The obtained results can be further applied in the design and operation of the microfluidic devices based on the photothermally induced phase change. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Whereas the encapsulation technology of surfactants coating on the surface of single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) attracts much attention, the mechanisms of asymmetric surfactants interacting with the SWCNTs and their molecular structures are rarely reported. Herein, we report a molecular dynamics (MD) simulation study on the investigation of surfactant adsorption and induced colloidal stability onto different SWCNTs. The surfactant-based encapsulation system, originating from the complementary pi-pi stacking, is validated through two-dimensional number density maps. We find that the asymmetric pyrenyl-gemini surfactants (APGSs) form double-layer assembled architecture films on nanotube surface. The inner layers of the films are packed with the pyrenyl groups of APGSs, which interact with SWCNTs via pi-pi stacking, while the outer layers composed of alkyl chains of APGSs coat at the nanotube surface through van der Waals interactions. In addition, we observe a configurational transformation of APGSs on the SWCNT surface from the folding configuration to unfolding patterns, when increasing the nanotube radius or the surface coverage of APGSs. Our study provides helpful insights into the encapsulation mechanism of APGSs on the SWCNT surface and the design of highly selective dispersants for SWCNTs. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB In this study it is evaluated how large open algae ponds can be supplied with sufficient CO2. Therefore, a 2.2 acre and a 10 acre pond are simulated over a one-year operating period. The ponds are operated with two different kinds of algae that achieve a yearly yield of 8 g/m(2)d and 25 g/m(2)d. The algae consume CO2, which is fed into the ponds as CO2 gas injected into sumps.
   The algae ponds have such long channels that the CO2 has to be injected at multiple points along the channel to keep the pH value in the pond within a specified operating range. The necessary number of injection points is determined for different operating pH ranges. Furthermore, the influence of multiple injection points on algae showing a pH dependent growth is evaluated.
   The investigations show that it is possible to supply such large ponds with sufficient CO2 by injecting CO2 gas whose volume flow is controlled by a proportional control algorithm. Large ponds that have long channels require more than one injection point along the channel. In some scenarios, even a high number of injection points cannot prevent the pH value from violating the lower limit of the operating range. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Microscale transport phenomena govern the overall transport mechanism during drying of plant-based food material. However, there is limited research available that considers micro-level transport phenomena during drying. The primary goal of this work is to develop a microscale drying model based on the heterogeneous microstructure of the plant-based food materials to predict cellular-level water transport mechanism during drying. The microstructure, which was used as a heterogenous computational domain for the model, was developed from scanning electron microscope images of food samples. Simulation results show that moisture transport and distribution are significantly affected by the characteristics of cells, the intercellular spaces and the cell walls. The predicted moisture profile from the developed model was compared with results obtained by X-ray microtomography (mu CT), and a good agreement was found. The model and the experimental results also confirmed that a water gradient (2-3%) still existed in the dried sample around the walls of the cells that are located at the centre of the tissue. The micro-level temperature distribution in the cells and intercellular spaces was also successfully predicted. It was found that the air-filled intercellular spaces were heated faster than the cells during drying. Sensitivity studies were performed to investigate the influence of the key drying parameters on the micro-level transport process. The developed model accurately reflects the micro-level transport phenomena that occur during drying. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Grand Canonical Monte Carlo simulation of methanol adsorption on a graphite model with two hydroxyl groups grafted on the surface has been carried out to investigate the effects of temperature in the range of 278-360 K. The spacing between the OH groups was chosen so that two hydrogen bonds could be formed with the first methanol molecule. In the Henry law region, the isosteric heat at zero loading is greater than the condensation heat. When the loading is increased, the isosteric heat at low temperatures decreases slightly and exhibits a shoulder, which is associated with the formation of a cluster of methanol molecules around one OH group. On further increase in loading, the adsorbate-adsorbate interactions decrease because methanol begins to adsorb on the other OH group, resulting in a sharp decrease in the isosteric heat to a minimum, at which point both OH groups are covered with methanol molecules. At higher temperatures the isosteric heat at zero loading decreases but remains higher than the condensation heat. The shoulder heat is progressively diminished with temperature because methanol molecules are distributed over the two OH groups, due to the entropic effects. Interestingly, the minimum heat still occurs when the functional groups are covered and is even more pronounced at high temperatures. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Continuous Stirred Tank Reactors (CSTR) are the most important and central equipment in many chemical and biochemical industries, that exhibit second order complex nonlinear dynamics. The nonlinear dynamics of CSTR poses many design and control challenges. The proposed controller guarantees a stable closed loop behavior over multiple operating points even in the presence of perturbations and parametric anomalies. An event driven sliding mode control is presented in this work to regulate the temperature and concentration states very close to the equilibrium points of a CSTR. The control is executed only when a predefined condition gets violated and hence, the controller is relaxed when the system is operating under tolerable limits of closed loop performance. A novel dynamic event triggering rule is presented to maintain desired performance with minimum computational cost. The inter event execution time is shown to be lower bounded by a finite positive quantity to exclude Zeno behavior. Sliding mode control (SMC) combined with event triggering scheme retains the inherent robustness of traditional SMC and aids in reducing computational load on the controller involved. Simulation results validate the efficiency of the proposed controller. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Numerical CFD simulations are used to demonstrate the performance characteristics of a novel spiral geometry, which is used for catalytic micro-combustion in this work. This reactor has catalytic channel, with inlet at the center and spiraling outwards. The spiral microreactor geometry allows preheating of the cold inlet owing to heat exchange with the hot products flowing in co-current direction in the adjacent channel. Results indicate that the spiral is more stable than the straight channel reactor, due to the transverse heat transfer between adjacent channels in the spiral reactor. 2D simulations are performed to comprehensively analyze the role of this heat recirculation on the thermal management and stability of catalytic combustion of propane/air mixtures; and the spiral microreactor is compared with the well-studied straight channel microreactor. Axial and transverse temperature profiles at various design and operating conditions are analyzed for a better understanding of heat recirculation in this geometry. Effect of various parameters viz. equivalence ratio (phi), inlet velocity (u(0)), wall thermal conductivity (k(s)) and number of turns (N) on the spiral reactor's stability and performance is presented.

AB Separation of colloidal nanoparticulates requires tight ultrafiltration (TUF) membranes. Phenolic polymers with well-defined sub-10 nm mesopores are promising candidates for such membranes, but suffer from intrinsic fragility. Herein, robust mesoporous phenolic membranes with flexibly adjustable TUF functions are realized through a new pore-filling strategy. Phenolic prepolymers with tunable fluidity are spontaneously filled into macroporous substrates with precisely controllable filling depths. Subsequent thermopolymerization fully cures the prepolymer and acid soaking removes the templating pluronic copolymers, producing composite TUF membranes with mesoporous phenolics embedded in flexible substrates. The membranes exhibit widely adjustable molecular-weight-cut-offs (MWCOs) (2.6-41 kg/mol) depending on the filling depth of phenolics while maintain otherwise unattainable high permeabilities. We further investigate the separation of CdTe and carbon quantum dots dispersed in water and toluene by these membranes, and they show excellent concentration and fractionation effect. This work enables efficient separation of ultra-small colloids by robust TUF membranes. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This article describes a comparison between a packed-sand geometric model derived from experimental digitization of a small volume of sand and from a mathematical model (Yet Another Development Engine, YADE) that produces a random packing of spherical particles. As the application of the model is towards smoldering combustion, the comparison focuses on the pressure drop and convective heat transfer at very low Reynolds numbers and a wide range of high temperatures. The comparison shows that the YADE geometric model gives results that are in good agreement with the digitized packed-sand model in the range of Reynolds numbers considered, which, given the cost and time saving of using a mathematical model, is an extremely useful result. The geometric model was also used to explore the influence of particle size variation and temperature dependence of air properties affects the flow and convective exchange at temperatures relevant to smouldering combustion. A correlation is presented to demonstrate how the heat transfer results can be put into a compact form for use in computations using a porous continuum approach. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Fiber-based coalescers are widely used in the chemical industry to separate two immiscible fluids. Due to the complex structure inside a coalescer and the opaque nature of the fiber material, it is impractical to perform direct visualization and measurement of the multiphase flow inside a coalescer. One fundamental problem in understanding the physics inside a liquid-gas coalescer is to determine the maximum size of a drop that can attach and remain on a fiber. Previous studies (Hung and Yao, 1999; Lorenceau et al., 2004; Wang and Desjardins, 2018) have provided models to estimate the maximum size of a drop on a horizontal cylindrical fiber under gravity or cross-flow. However, it is not clear whether these models hold when the fiber shape and contact angle change. In this paper, we numerically investigate the critical drop size on a thin fiber with different shapes and contact angles, and provide a model that can be used for future coalescer modeling and design.

AB We extend effective medium theory (EMT) to composite hollow fiber mixed matrix membranes, considering the asymmetric filler volume fraction profile arising from finite system size. This volume fraction profile leads to strong variation of the driving force (i.e. pseudo-bulk concentration gradient) in the regions adjacent to the composite ends, and to sensitivity of the effective permeability of the composite to the geometrical configuration. The new theory is validated against rigorous simulations of the transport in mixed-matrix membranes (MMMs) using both concentration-independent and concentration-dependent diffusivities in the MMM constituent phases. Both theory and simulations show that flat mixed-matrix membranes (F-MMMs) have higher effective overall permeability than hollow fiber mixed-matrix membranes (HF-MMMs), upon comparison of systems having identical operating conditions, filler phase loading and particle size. Furthermore, we show here that the sensitivity to the geometry vanishes with increase of inner radius of the hollow fiber membrane at fixed thickness, and the effective permeability of a HF-MMM is found to asymptotically approach that of a F-MMM.

TI The non-catalytic partial oxidation of methane in a flow tube reactor

AB Methane partial oxidation is one way of producing synthesis gas which is the feedstock of Fischer-Tropsch synthesis and methanol synthesis. The high ignition temperature of methane partial oxidation is always a concern to industries and researches, leading to inaccuracies in temperature measurement, reaction model development, and subsequent understanding of reaction mechanisms and the predictive abilities of developed models. A gas-flow reactor system incorporating indirect induction heating was designed and operated for the non-catalytic partial oxidation of CH4. Experiments of methane partial oxidation diluted by nitrogen were conducted and the effects of temperature (1270-1767 K), stoichiometry (CH4/O-2 = 1-2), and H-2 addition were studied. Thermodynamic and kinetic simulations were also performed in this study and compared to the experimental results. Reduced mechanisms were applied in computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations to correct the temperature profiles which were adopted in kinetic modelling. Kinetic simulations of the experimental conditions were conducted using reported mechanisms: GRI-Mech 3.0 and the mechanism developed by Glarborg's group. In general the simulated gas-phase compositions at the exit of the reactor and trends for each set of experiments were consistent with the experimental data. The Glarborg mechanism was found to be more accurate in the prediction of the selectivity of C-2 hydrocarbons (particularly acetylene) as the Glarborg mechanism contains more pathways for the conversion of C2H2 into polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). The combination of CFD modelling and kinetic modelling offset the deviation of temperature measurement and hence provided a sample for high temperature reaction simulation.

AB Gas-solid, gas-catalytic and physical applications in a fluidized bed require a strict control of the solids residence time and a limited back-mixing for a required conversion. Since conversion proceeds with residence time, this residence time and its distribution (RTD) are essential design parameters in fluidized bed modeling. The experiments of the present research investigate the use of a shallow cross-flow bubbling fluidized bed as reactor. A tracer stimulus response technique was used to determine the RTD, in a fluidized bed with and without internals.
   Experimental results were compared with fittings from several models. Although a cascade of perfectly mixed reactors or a plug flow with dispersion model can be applied, the latter is preferred, and the dispersion parameter, expressed as Peclet number, exceeds similar to 25.
   The results are moreover used in a test case design of hexane devolatilization from rice bran cake. With the RTD model of the horizontal fluidized bed, and with batch kinetic experiments, the size of the desolventizer can be designed on the basis of the required residence time. The superficial fluidization velocity applied is normally 3-4 times U-mf. A similar RTD-approach can be used for alternative physical processes (e.g. drying) and for chemical reactions (e.g. calcination of dolomite) provided kinetic data from batch experiments are known.

AB Industry trends suggest that the feedstock and product portfolios along with utilized technologies of chemical process industry (CPI) may grow and be quite different compared to today's in the near future. Incorporation of new feedstocks and technologies into the existing CPI infrastructure may require significant amounts of investments. Determining the investment decisions, i.e., how much to invest, which technologies to invest in, and when to invest in each technology for research and development and for capacity expansion, is a challenging task, because there are often many emerging technologies and the future performances of these technologies are uncertain. Here, we present a multistage stochastic programming (MSSP) formulation accounting for both endogenous and exogenous uncertain parameters associated with the new technology investment planning (NTIP) problem. The MSSP formulation is used to determine investment decisions for four case studies, including a biomass to ethylene production network. The solution for the biomass to ethylene case study suggests that, given the current market conditions, the investment in biomass technologies is not financially advantageous. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The flow mechanism of natural gas in the shale matrix is closely related to the high efficient development of shale gas reservoirs. However, the flow characteristic of shale gas in nanometer pores is scale dependent, and is also affected by the formation condition, adsorption layer, residual water saturation and detailed pore structure. In this study, a lattice Boltzmann model with a regularization procedure was applied to simulate shale gas flow in a 2D porous medium, and the effects of slippage, adsorption layer, residual water saturation and surface area on the apparent permeability were discussed. Simulation results indicate that the apparent permeability decreases with the increasing formation pressure, and increases with the increasing formation temperature and characteristic pore size. The adsorption layer and residual water affect the apparent permeability by changing the effective pore space for gas flow. And the effect is more obvious under the large Knudsen number conditions. When the porosity of the porous media is constant, the apparent permeability decreases with the increasing surface area, and the large surface area would even offset the positive effect of slippage on the apparent permeability.

AB The Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) method is used to determine the flow through a model screw extruder at low Reynolds number with an emphasis on resolving the flow in narrow gaps, which are known to produce high shear rates and generate large temperatures. Firstly we demonstrate the validity of the SPH methodology by comparison on simple flows with known analytic solutions. We find excellent agreement and this also allows us to estimate the SPH particle size that is required to obtain accurate solutions for these and more complex flows. SPH simulations on a model single screw extruder with a kneading element are then compared with FEM solutions. Once again excellent agreement is achieved. Finally we demonstrate the SPH method on a model twin screw extruder, which is shown to be robust and qualitatively valid. In general these results show that SPH will be an important computational tool to investigate flows in similar devices. Crown Copyright (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is the most common Multivariate Statistical Process Control (MSPC) method that is widely used for Fault Detection and Diagnosis (FDD). Since early abnormality detection with high accuracy is required for safe and reliable process operation, False Alarms Rate (FAR), Missed Detection Rate (MDR) and the detection time delay are the major factors that must be taken into consideration when developing any process monitoring scheme. Unfortunately, the PCA performance, with fixed limits, is weak in terms of the stated factors. In contrast, conventional Moving Window PCA (MWPCA) is an adaptive technique which updates both the PCA model and the thresholds once a new normal observation is available. Yet, MWPCA methodology still does not reduce the MDR and the detection delay. In this paper, a Modified MWPCA (MMWPCA) with Fuzzy Logic Filter (FLF) is proposed to enhance the monitoring performance of PCA. It is an adaptive approach with a fixed model that combines both aforementioned techniques. The aim of using FLF is to ensure robustness to false alarms without affecting the Fault Detection (FD) performance. The application of the proposed method has been carried out on the Tennessee Eastman Process (TEP). Hold-one and hold-five MMWPCA with FLF are applied and compared to recent FDD work in the literature. The obtained results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed technique in detecting different types of faults with high accuracy and with shorter time delay. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The hydraulic fracturing fluid can easily infiltrate the ultra-tight shale matrix due to the remarkable slip feature of the liquid flow in nanoscale pores, showing a higher-than-expected fluid-loss in shale gas development. In this paper, a stochastic apparent liquid permeability (ALP) model is developed to reveal water transport mechanisms in dual-wettability nanoporous shale based on the transport behavior in a single nanotube. The present model considers the wettability and pore size related liquid slip effect, total organic carbon (TOC) content, and the structural parameters (maximum and minimum pore size of inorganic or inorganic matter, porosity) of shale matrix. The results show that the multilayer sticking effect (structural water molecules in the pore surface) constricts the flow capacity and slightly decreases the ALP for the inorganic hydrophilic matter, while, a large slip length for the water flow can be observed and the ALP is dramatically improved if the nanopores in the organic matter are strong hydrophobic, especially in organic-rich shale reservoir. The ALP can be reduced or enhanced with the increase of TOC content, which is determined by the relative importance of pore size difference (between organic matter and inorganic matter) and wettability of organic matter. Additionally, the sensitivity analysis of structural parameters on the ALP are examined. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Polymers and polymer-based gels are used in the oil industry to improve the oil displacement efficiency and address unwanted fluids (water and/or gas) production, respectively. In this work, existing commercial polymer and polymer-based chemicals are screened and evaluated in the laboratory for water management and enhanced oil recovery applications in naturally fractured carbonate (chalk) reservoirs. Several bulk- and core-based testing techniques are used to achieve this goal with the selected chemicals undergone thorough investigation of their filterability, injectivity, gelation time, gel strength, gel shrinkage, and impact on oil production. Injection of high and low molecular weight hydrolyzed polyacrylamide (HPAM) polymers into fractured-porous cores does not hinder the oil production mechanism in chalk formations yielding a lower oil recovery rate but comparable ultimate recoveries with water injection. The environmental friendly Polymer B gelant is "inconsistent" related to the formation of gel; when it gels, the quality of the formed gel is poor and provide no resistance to a post-treatment water injection. The non-environmentally friendly Polymer A gelant worked consistently concerning gelation and yielded good quality, strong gels that can withstand post-treatment applied pressures during water injection.

AB This paper presents a novel, in-line Electrical Resistance Rheometry (ERR) technique which is able to obtain the rheological information of process fluids, in-situ, based on electrical resistance sensing. By cross-correlating fluctuations of computed conductivity pixels across and along a pipe, using non-invasive microelectrical tomography sensors, rheometric data is obtained through the direct measurement of the radial velocity profile. A range of simple, Newtonian and non-Newtonian fluids, have been examined with the obtained velocity profiles independently validated using Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV); results from both ERR and PIV techniques are in excellent agreement. Comparison of the rheological parameters obtained from ERR with off-line rheology measurements demonstrated that ERR was able to perform with an accuracy of 98% for both Newtonian and non-Newtonian fluids. The ERR technique presented offers new capabilities of true in-situ analysis of fluids relevant to formulated products and in-pipe spatial and temporal analyses afford the simultaneous interrogation of localised and global mixing behaviour.

AB Acoustic agglomeration is an aerosol preconditioning technology in which intense sound field is applied to promote relative motions and rapid agglomeration among particles. In order to improve the acoustic agglomeration efficiency and reduce its energy consumption, the method of adding liquid droplets into the aerosol was proposed and demonstrated to be effective. However, modeling and theoretical prediction of this process has been still lacking until now. In this paper, a three-dimensional discrete element modeling of aerosol acoustic agglomeration with addition of sprayed liquid droplets is established, which includes the agglomeration mechanisms of orthokinetic interaction, acoustic wake effect, gravity force and Brownian random force. In particular, the immersion mechanism is employed to describe the microscopic formation of aggregates. In addition, the multiple-time-step algorithm and the contact detection method based on a search grid are employed to speed up the simulation. Meanwhile, the corresponding experiments using coal-fired fly ash particles were performed to validate the simulation. It is found that the results of the discrete element modeling simulation are in reasonable good agreement with the experimental results, for both cases with and without the addition of water droplets. However, when the agglomeration efficiency exceeds 80% at the later stage of the process, some discrepancy is observed due to the breakage of large aggregates which is not taken into consideration in the modeling.

AB Particle and slip velocity evaluations are essential for the design of dilute phase pneumatic conveying systems in which the particles are fully suspended in the pipe, transportet at high velocities and low pressures with solid loading ratios that do not exceed 15. Although the subject was widely researched, it lacks a consistent correlation over various operating conditions and wide range of particle properties. Moreover, investigating the three dimensional velocity distribution in a cross section of a pipe may further contribute to the understanding of the phenomenon. In this study, we present a thorough experimental investigation of particle velocity obtained from 3", 2" and 1" horizontal, dilute phase pneumatic conveying systems with various operating conditions and conveyed material with the following property ranges: 0.06 mm < d(p) < 4 mm; 940 kg/m(3) < rho(p) < 5800 kg/m(3); 14 m/s < U-g < 28 m/s; 2.4: . 10(4) < Re-g < 1.4 . 10(5); 26 mm < D < 76 mm; 0.3 < eta < 3. The velocity was obtained using a high speed video camera combined with image processing. Data was obtained in all three dimensions for each particle allowing an investigation of the velocity distribution and the effect each component has on the equivalent velocity. The velocities of the non-axial directions were found to be considerably low in relative to the axial velocity. Therefore, in terms of the kinetic energy (e.g.), the non-axial velocities have negligible contribution; however, they have a major effect on the flow and acceleration mechanism. A correlation is presented for the axial particle velocity evaluation in the range of the tested operating conditions, which is mainly affected by the Archimedes number of the particle, with a good fit of our data and various data points from previous publications.

AB The knowledge of the influence of swarm effects on gas-liquid mass transfer is still limited. In this article, an optical measurement method for the identification of local mixing properties, mass flow rates, and mass transfer coefficients in the wake of rising bubbles with and without swarm turbulence is presented. Two-dimensional concentration data is temporally rearranged to reconstruct a quasi tri-dimensional concentration wake. By this means, the path of the bubble-wake-complex can now be visualized. The analysis shows that mixing time decreases strongly with superimposed swarm turbulence and becomes independent of bubble size. This is expected to have a major influence on chemical reactions. Especially slow parallel and consecutive reaction steps are promoted by poor mixing.
   Additionally based on locally measured data, mass transfer coefficients of bubbles rising in countercurrent flow and with superimposed swarm turbulence are calculated. With the presented method, concentration distributions are now accessible in bubble flows with high spatiotemporal resolution. This paves the way for validating numerical simulations and developing physically determined models. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Intermittent flows in vertical pipes occur in many industrial settings including power generation and downstream oil-and gas production. This type of flows include cap bubble, slug and churn flow regimes. These regimes are of interest as downstream processes and control may heavily depend on the intermittency of the inflow. There are a number of correlations that predicts the features in such flows in vertical pipes. Most of the correlations were developed for air and water fluid pair for slug flow regime in vertical pipes with 25 to 50 mm inner diameter. In this paper, an attempt has been made to assess the suitability of several of these correlations specific to slug flow regime for a fluid pair that is different to air-water system. In this work, air-silicone oil flow development was experimentally investigated in a vertical pipe with an inner diameter of 68 mm. A Wire Mesh Sensor (WMS) and an Electrical Capacitance Tomography (ECT) sensor were installed in series at four locations (15D, 30D, 45D and 65D) downstream of the mixing section. The flow was visually observed using a high speed camera. The void fraction time series obtained from the WMS and the ECT were used to establish the flow characteristics such as slug length, slug frequency, void fraction in liquid slugs and Taylor bubble velocity. A comparison showed that the void fraction measurements using ECT and WMS are in good agreement. Axial measurements shows that the flow development beyond 45D is minimal. Change in physical properties of the liquid phase is responsible for the deviation associated with the existing slug flow models, particularly those developed to predict the gas holdup in liquid slugs.

AB In the study of meso-scale structures of multi-phase flow in bubble columns, accurate modelling of the interaction between the turbulence eddies and particle/bubble groups is crucial for capturing the heat and mass transfer occurring between the bubbles and surrounding carrier fluid. This work focuses on the influence of bubble shape variations on bubble breakage due to the eddy collision with the bubbles in bubble column flows. An improved breakage model accounting for the variation of bubble shapes was proposed. The improved breakage model coupled with the widely adopted isotropic, homogeneous turbulence kinetic energy spectrums, that are currently available from the open literature, takes into account the different energy requirements in forming the daughter bubbles, i.e. the increase of in surface energy and the pressure head difference of the bubble and its surrounding turbulent eddies. The simulation results compared with experimental data have clearly demonstrated that the improved model effectively describes the various shapes of bubble breakage events, which may consequently have a strong impact on the interfacial area estimation that is crucial for calculation of the transfer rates of mass and heat transfer in the bubble columns.
