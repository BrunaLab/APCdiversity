AB BACKGROUND: Severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a leading cause of death among children. Although several studies have reported the negative effects of concomitant injuries on mortality in adults with TBI, their effect on pediatric patients remains unclear. Our objective was to describe the effect of serious concomitant injuries on outcomes in pediatric patients with severe TBI.
   METHODS: We identified pediatric patients (<18 years) with severe TBI between 2004 and 2015, through the Japan Trauma Data Bank. We excluded patients who had cardiopulmonary arrest on arrival and those whose main outcome (mortality) was missed from the analyses. Two groups with severe TBI were compared on the basis of the presence of serious concomitant injuries (maximum Abbreviated Injury Scale score >= 3 in regions other than the head) and adjusted for potential confounders using multiple logistic regression analysis.
   RESULTS: One-thousand-and-thirty-four participants were eligible for analysis, of which 472 had serious concomitant injuries. Pediatric patients with a serious concomitant injury had higher mortality. The probability difference was 11.5 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 6.1%-16.9%), which was greater than the mortality of 1.5 (95% CI: 1.2%-1.8%) observed in patients with a serious injury but not TBI. The presence of a serious concomitant injury was significantly associated with increased mortality, even after adjusting for possible confounders (adjusted odds ratio, 2.01; 95% CI, 1.40-2.89; P < 0.001).
   CONCLUSION: Serious concomitant injuries are associated with higher mortality in pediatric patients with severe TBI, as a direct consequence, as well as due to concomitant injuries potentiating TBI pathobiology.

AB BACKGROUND: Low bone mass in patients with adolescent idiopathic scoliosis has been well reported. Poor bone quality was regarded as a new and unique prognostic factor in aggravating curve progression. However, the potential biomechanical correlation between them remains unclear.
   METHODS: Three-dimensional finite element models of idiopathic scoliotic spine with different bone mineral status were created for axial loading simulation. An axial load of 3 different body weights was applied on different bone mineral mass models. The mechanical responses of the vertebral cortical and cancellous bone, facet joints, end plate, and intervertebral disc were analyzed.
   RESULTS: Accompanied with the low bone mineral status, thoracic scoliosis produced asymmetric and higher stress in the cortical bone, lumbar facet joints, and end plate at the concave side of the thoracic structure curve. Stress increased in the disc at the apex of the scoliosis, whereas it mildly decreased in the L4-5 and L5-S1 disc. Body weight gain increased the stress in scoliotic spine structures in all bone mineral statues.
   CONCLUSIONS: Biomechanical simulations indicated that low bone mineral mass might aggravate curve progression and induce more serious lumbar compensatory scoliosis in patients with adolescent idiopathic scoliosis. Weight gain was also a risk factor for curve progression.

AB BACKGROUND: Addition of fusion to decompression for stenosis with grade 1 degenerative spondylolisthesis is a controversial topic, and the question remains if fusion provides any benefit to the patient that warrants the increased health care utilization and perioperative morbidity. There is no consensus on indications for use of fusion over decompression alone.
   METHODS: Patients received fusion or decompression according to a decision-making protocol based on their pattern of complaints, location of the compression, and facet angles and effusion as proven predictors of postoperative instability. Propensity score matching of patients was done for baseline data.
   RESULTS: The study comprised 102 patients in 2 equally sized groups. No intergroup differences in numeric rating scale and Oswestry Disability Index were detected at any follow-up point (all P > 0.05). Duration of surgery, length of stay, estimated blood loss, and radiation doses were higher in the fusion group (all P < 0.001). Cumulative reoperation rate was similar with 6% for fusion and 8% for decompression (P > 0.05), as was the complication rate (8% vs. 6%, P > 0.05). Postoperative iatrogenic progression of spondylolisthesis requiring fusion surgery was seen in only 2% in the decompression group.
   CONCLUSIONS: Use of a decision-making protocol led to a low rate of iatrogenically increased spondylolisthesis after decompression, while retaining outcomes. These data suggest that a decision-making protocol based on clinical history, location of nerve root compression, and proven radiologic predictors of postoperative instability assigns patients to fusion or decompression in a safe and effective manner.

AB OBJECTIVE: This study was carried out to explore the diagnostic value of sagittalmeasurements for adjacent segment disease after lumbar transforaminal interbody fusion (TLIF).
   METHODS: A total of 163 subjects who underwent TLIF for lumbar disease were initially enrolled in the study from July 2013 to August 2017. Sagittal alignment including thoracic inlet and spinopelvic parameters was measured by using preoperative full-length freestanding radiographs. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to evaluate these parameters as the diagnostic index for adjacent segment disease (ASD).
   RESULTS: A total of 153 patients completed the final follow-up, and themean follow-up period was 40.6 months. There were 53 (35.3%) cases with ASD found after the TLIF in the enrolled subjects. Logistic regression analysis and receiver operating characteristic analysis confirmed that preoperative pelvic tilt (PT) of more than 24.1 degrees and thoracic kyphosis (TK) of more than 23.3 degrees were significant risk factors of ASD after TLIF (P < 0.05).
   CONCLUSIONS: We confirmed that PT of more than 24.3 degrees and TK of more than 23.3 degrees could be regarded as predictors of ASD after lumbar TLIF.

AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Among adults with posterior fossa tumors, an intraaxial location of the tumor is less common than an extraaxial location. Moreover, the differential diagnosis of a single cerebellar tumor in adults is sometimes difficult by conventional magnetic resonance imaging. We aimed to report the findings of positron emission tomography (PET) using 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) and methionine in adult patients with intraaxial and solitary metastatic brain tumors.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: FDG-PET was performed on 12 patients with posterior fossa tumors: 4 had solid hemangioblastoma (HB), 3 had primary central nervous system lymphomas, 1 had a glioblastoma, and 4 had single metastatic brain tumors (METs). Methionine-PET was performed on 9 patients except for 1 patient with a MET. The maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) of the tumor was measured and compared with pathologic findings.
   RESULTS: The SUVmax of FDG in HB was lower compared with that of other tumors (P = 0.001). On the other hand, the SUVmax of methionine in the HB cases was almost the same as that in other tumors (P = 0.07).
   CONCLUSION: FDG-PET was helpful in differentiating HBs from adult cerebellar tumors.

AB BACKGROUND: Some studies have reported that the conventional intersegmental pedicle screws (4-screw fixation [4S]) device for thoracolumbar fractures was associated with inadequate reduction of fractured vertebrae, insufficient correction of kyphosis, and implant failure. Recently, a series of biomechanical studies has confirmed that the addition of intermediate fixation screws (6-screw fixation [6S]) could provide stronger fixation and better reduction of fractured vertebrae. Nevertheless, the clinical and radiologic efficacy of the additional intermediate screws remains unclear.
   METHODS: A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials was used to compare clinical and radiologic outcomes and complications of posterior pedicle screws combined with intermediate screws fixation versus conventional intersegmental pedicle screw fixation. We comprehensively searched MEDLINE, OVID, and Springer according to a search strategy, selecting articles based on inclusion criteria, and extracted data from these reports. Risk of bias in included studies was assessed. Pooled estimates and corresponding 95% confidence intervals were calculated.
   RESULTS: Six randomized controlled trials involving 310 patients were evaluated in this meta-analysis. Pooled estimates showed statistically similar baseline characteristics, hospital stays, postoperative visual analog scale scores, and infection rates between the 4S group and the 6S group. The 6S group had significantly less correction loss of segmental angle and of anterior vertebral height compression, and lower implant failure rate. The 6S group also showed a slightly longer operative time and more blood loss than did the 4S group.
   CONCLUSIONS: Based on our analysis, the combined intermediate screws fixation technique was associated with significantly improved radiologic outcomes but did not seem to compromise other perioperative outcomes.

   RULE
AB OBJECTIVE: Facing mild traumatic brain injury, clinicians must decide whether to perform a computed tomography (CT) scan to detect a potential intracranial hemorrhage. Many useful guidelines have been developed for the general population, but there is no general consensus about the best practice to adopt when dealing with patients on antiplatelet or anticoagulation drugs. The relatively recent introduction of new anticoagulants and second-generation antiplatelet drugs poses new challenges in this field. There are no data in the literature about the relative risk of intracranial bleeding in such categories.
   METHODS: We enrolled 2773 consecutive patients presenting at our emergency department with mild traumatic brain injury as chief complaint and evaluated the results of their head CT scans, stratifying their anticoagulation and/or antiplatelet drug regime.
   RESULTS: Of these patients, 1608 matched the criteria for head CT scan and had a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of 15; 517 were on antiplatelet drugs, whereas 213 were on anticoagulants. The risk of developing intracranial bleeding was significantly higher for patients on antiplatelet drugs, whereas the risk of anticoagulated patients overlapped with that of the general population. The trend for second-generation drugs was of higher risk of bleeding only for antiplatelets.
   CONCLUSIONS: Patients with a GCS score of 15 on long-term anticoagulation therapy seem to be at no higher risk for intracranial hemorrhage than are nonanticoagulated patients. On the contrary, patients with a GCS score of 15 on antiplatelet therapy seem to be more prone to developing intracranial bleeding than are the general population, with a trend to be more at risk when it comes to second-generation drugs.

AB BACKGROUND: Treatment of intracranial aneurysms (IAs) is largely guided by IA size and growth. Preliminary investigations have found a relationship between clinical factors and growth; yet, the relationship between morphologic and hemodynamic risk prediction models in IA growth is unknown.
   METHODS: We analyzed serial images of 5 growing and 6 stable IAs. Rupture resemblance scores (RRSs) were calculated from three-dimensional segmented images and computational fluid dynamics simulations. The morphologic (RRSM), hemodynamic (RRSH), and combination (RRSC) scores leveraged IA size ratio, wall shear stress, and oscillatory shear index. Comparisons of RRS and morphologic and hemodynamic characteristics were made between growing and stable IAs at the baseline time point and between the baseline and follow-up time points of the growing IAs. In addition, we investigated the correlation of growth rate and RRS and the hemodynamics of growing and stable regions were compared.
   RESULTS: Our results indicate that there is no statistical difference in IAs at the baseline time point; however, growing IAs tend to have a higher aspect ratio (P = 0.066), undulation index (P = 0.086), and RRSC (P = 0.86). In addition, we found a significant correlation between growth rate and baseline RRS of all 3 models (RRSM, r = 0.874, P < 0.001; RRSH, r = 0.727, P = 0.011; RRSC, r = 0.815, P = 0.002). We also found that growing IAs significantly increased in aspect ratio (P = 0.034), size ratio (P = 0.034), and RRSM (P = 0.034). Our results show that stable and growing regions had statistically different wall shear stress and oscillatory shear index.
   CONCLUSIONS: Based on this preliminary study, we conjecture that aneurysms that resemble ruptured IAs may grow faster.

AB OBJECTIVE: To study the clinical and morphologic characteristics associated with risk factors for the rupture of intracranial aneurysms (IAs).
   METHODS: A total of 1115 consecutive patients with 1282 IAs were reviewed from August 2011 to February 2016. The patients and IAs were divided into ruptured and unruptured groups. Based on the clinical and morphologic findings, the risk factors for IA rupture were assessed using statistical methods.
   RESULTS: Age, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and cerebral atherosclerosis were associated with ruptured IAs. IAs located in the anterior cerebral artery, the anterior communicating artery, the posterior communicating artery, and the internal carotid artery were associated with ruptured IAs. Ruptures were also associated with arterial bifurcations, irregular aneurysm shapes, and all continuous data, except neck width. Binary logistic regression showed that IAs located at bifurcations (odds ratio [OR], 1.804), with irregular shapes (OR, 4.677), with high aspect ratios (ARs) (OR, 5.037) or with small mean diameters (MDs) (OR, 0.495) are more prone to rupture. Receiver operating characteristic analysis showed that the threshold values of the AR and MD were 1 and 3.70 mm, respectively.
   CONCLUSIONS: Morphologic characteristics, such as being located at bifurcations, being irregularly shaped, having a high AR (>1), and having a small MD (<3.70 mm), were better predictors of rupture.

AB BACKGROUND: Obesity is associated with increasing morbidity and mortality in many prevalent diseases, especially lumbar degenerative disease. The relationship between minimally invasive surgery (MIS) of the spine and perioperative adverse events in obese patients with lumbar degenerative disease has not been well evaluated.
   METHODS: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to identify relevant studies involving obese patients with spine MIS in electronic databases up to June 2017, including Web of Science, Embase, PubMed, the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register, and the Cochrane Library. The PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines, GRADE (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation) system, and Cochrane Handbook were applied to assess the quality of the results published in all included studies.
   RESULTS: No significant difference was found in postoperative complications between obese and nonobese patients, according to the Oswestry Disability Index, and visual analog scale. However, there were significant differences between the 2 groups in surgery time, blood loss, and length of hospital stay.
   CONCLUSIONS: There does not seem to be an increased risk of developing perioperative complications in obese patients undergoing spine MIS. Spine MIS was a safe and effective technique for obese patients. However, according to our pooled data, longer surgery time was observed in obese patients.

   OUTCOMES
AB BACKGROUND: Microvascular decompression (MVD) and Gamma Knife surgery (GKS) are the primary treatments for trigeminal neuralgia (TN). However, many patients require further surgical treatment after initial surgery for recurrent TN. The aim of this study was to evaluate efficacy and safety of GKS for recurrent TN cases with prior MVD.
   METHODS: From October 2008 to June 2015, 658 patients at West China Hospital underwent GKS as the only surgical treatment, and 42 patients underwent GKS with prior MVD. The single 4-mm isocenter was located at the cisternal portion of the trigeminal nerve in all patients. Median maximum prescription dose was 85 Gy (range, 70-90 Gy).
   RESULTS: Median follow-up time was 6.2 years (range, 1.1-10 years). The percentage of patients with or without previous MVD within 1 year was 56.81%, and the percentage of patients who were pain-free was 74.74%. The recurrence rates within 10 years were 49.11% and 43.74% for patients with and without MVD, respectively. Also, 9.52% and 11.04% of patients with and without previous MVD experienced complications as a result of GKS during the long-term follow-up period. Patients who underwent previous MVD showed a significantly lower pain-free rate compared with patients without previous MVD (P = 0.01). There was no statistical significance in the recurrence rate (P = 0.82) or the complications (P = 0.93) in the 2 groups during the long-term follow-up period.
   CONCLUSIONS: For patients with recurrent TN who previously underwent MVD, GKS remains an efficacious and safe mode of treatment.

AB BACKGROUND: Cerebellar mutism syndrome (CMS) is rarely described in adults; however, data on self-assessed linguistic complications after posterior fossa surgery do not exist.
   METHODS: Through a prospective single-center study, data on 59 tumor operations in the posterior fossa were collected preoperatively as well as 1 week and 1 month postoperatively. Data on self-assessed problems in 5 CMS-related domains, CMS scores, and neurology as well as surgical procedure and complications were obtained.
   RESULTS: Data on CMS-related complications were obtained on 56 of the 59 operations. None was found to have CMS according to the CMS score. Within each of the 5 domains, at least 9 operations (16%) were followed by development or worsening of self-assessed CMS-related complications. Self-assessed complications were found to be most frequent after primary tumor surgeries, although they were significant only for speech and motor complications (P value = 0.01 and 0.02). Speech and language complications occurred more frequently in midline tumors compared with lateral tumors (40% vs. 7%; P = 0.004). Surgical complications were similar to other studies.
   CONCLUSIONS: We propose that speech and language problems in adults undergoing surgery in the posterior fossa occur more frequently than previously assumed. Some of the self-assessed complications might reflect components of the cerebellar cognitive affective syndrome. Our findings are consistent with the fact that midline location of the tumor is one of the few known risk factors for CMS in children. Thus, the cerebellar midline seems to be a vulnerable region for speech and language complications also in adults.

   HEAD-INJURY; PHENYTOIN; PREVENTION; RISK; CHILDREN; ADULTS
AB BACKGROUND: Moderate to severe traumatic brain injury confers increased risk of posttraumatic seizures (PTSs). Early PTSs are diagnosed when seizures develop within 7 days after injury, whereas seizures diagnosed as late PTSs occur later. Patients have been treated with phenytoin (PHT) to prevent early PTSs and more recently with levetiracetam (LEV). Various regimens have been tried in patients to prevent late PTSs with variable success. We assessed and compared effectiveness of these drugs on early and late PTS prevention.
   METHODS: A literature search revealed 120 articles. Data were included if the same factors were compared across studies with identical treatment arms. Random effects models were used for meta-analysis to combine data into an overriding odds ratio (OR) comparing PTS incidence. For early PTSs, PHT was compared with placebo and LEV with PHT. For late PTSs, each drug was compared with placebo.
   RESULTS: Sixteen studies were included. PHT was associated with decreased odds of early seizures relative to placebo (OR [0.34, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.19e 0.62). There was no difference in early seizure incidence between LEV and PHT (OR = 0.83, 95% CI 0.33-2.1). Neither LEV (OR [0.69, 95% CI 0.24-1.96) nor PHT (OR = 0.4, 95% CI 0.1-1.6) was associated with fewer late PTSs than placebo.
   CONCLUSIONS: New literature is consistent with current guidelines supporting antiepileptic drug administration for prevention of early, but not late, PTSs. With regard to early PTS prevention, LEV and PHT are similarly efficacious, which is consistent with current guidelines. Side-effect profiles favor LEV administration over PHT.

AB BACKGROUND: This review assessed the efficacy of epidural steroid administration on the reduction of pain, hospital stay time, and use of opioid analgesics postoperatively.
   METHODS: We searched Medline, PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews for studies using epidural steroids through any route after lumbar surgery. The primary study outcomes included preoperative and postoperative pain as assessed with a visual analogue scale (VAS), length of hospital stay (LOS), and postoperative use of opioid analgesics. The data were extracted and stratified according to the steroid administered. Data were then assessed for heterogeneity, subgroup differences, and ultimately tabulated in a Forest plot.
   RESULTS: A total of 17 randomized controlled trials were included in this review, with 16 undergoing quantitative analysis. Steroids were shown to be superior in terms of VAS outcome at 24 hours, with triamcinolone and dexamethasone performing similarly. Methylprednisolone paradoxically performed worse at the 24-hour mark. At 1 month, all steroids illustrated superiority in terms of VAS outcome. Steroids also proved superior in reducing LOS and postoperative use of opioid analgesia.
   CONCLUSIONS: Intraoperative or perioperative epidural administration of steroids offers significant benefits in terms of pain control, reduction in LOS, and use of postoperative opioid analgesia. Before steroids are routinely used by spinal surgeons, however, significantly more research is required. A particular emphasis should be placed on quality study protocols and data recording, to allow for more thorough analyses in the future.

AB BACKGROUND: Unilateral masticatory muscle spasm is a rare disease without a generally accepted and efficacious treatment plan.
   OBJECTIVE: We sought to compare the effects of different surgical treatments on unilateral masticatory muscle spasm.
   METHODS: A retrospective analysis of the surgical treatment and effects of 10 cases of unilateral masticatory muscle spasm occurred between February 2010 and September 2016. Three cases underwent complete amputation of the trigeminal motor branch, 3 cases underwent partial amputation of the trigeminal motor branch, and 4 cases received only vascular decompression. All patients were followed up by telephone interview after surgery.
   RESULTS: In the simple vascular decompression group, 3 cases were cured and 1 was cured after a delay. Of these 3 cases, 1 case became aggravated 2 years after the operation, 1 case became aggravated 5 years after the operation, and 1 case showed no change during the follow-up period. In the partial amputation group, 2 cases were cured and 1 case was alleviated. Of the 2 patients who were cured, 1 suffered recurrence 2 years later, while the other case showed no recurrence during the follow-up period. In the complete amputation group, 1 case was cured with a delay and 2 cases were cured immediately with no recurrence during the follow-up. Mild atrophy of the temporal muscle occurred gradually with no restriction of the mouth opening in 2 cases.
   CONCLUSIONS: Complete amputation of the trigeminal nerve did achieve better effects than pure microvascular decompression and partial amputation of the trigeminal motor branch, but it may lead to mild temporal muscle atrophy.

AB OBJECTIVE: The aim of the present multicenter, retrospective study was to assess the safety and effectiveness of different surgery strategies for the treatment of thoracic tuberculosis and to provide a reference for surgical treatment of thoracic tuberculosis.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study reviewed 394 patients with thoracic tuberculosis who were treated in 6 institutions between January 2000 and January 2015. There were 208 men and 186 women with an average age of 34.92 +/- 13.14 years (range 5-76 years). A total of 73 patients underwent one-stage anterior surgery (group A); 84 underwent an anterior combined posterior surgery (group B); and 237 underwent one-stage posterior surgery (group C). Clinical outcome, laboratory indexes, and radiologic results were analyzed to observe the advantage of posterior approach surgery.
   RESULTS: All cases were followed up for about 26-60 months (average of 37 months). At the last follow-up, all patients reached bone fusion, pain relief, and neurologic recovery. There were significant differences before and after treatment in terms of the visual analog scale and Oswestry Disability Index scores (P < 0.05). Posterior approach significantly improved kyphosis (P < 0.05).
   CONCLUSIONS: Posterior fixation is superior to anterior fixation in the correction of kyphosis and maintenance of spinal stability. One-stage posterior surgery can achieve the same efficacy as anterior-only or combined surgery, with less trauma, less blood loss, and shorter operative times. However, for wide lesions or paraspinal abscesses, severe bone destruction, and anterior and middle column defects that are too large after debridement to require long segment bone grafting, the anterior combined posterior approach is indispensable.

AB OBJECTIVE: Although repeat microvascular decompression (MVD) for hemifacial spasm (HFS) in patients with failed prior MVD is potentially curative, little is known about the long-term results of repeat MVD. We aimed to evaluate the long-term outcomes and complications after repeat MVD for HFS.
   METHODS: We performed repeat MVD on 78 consecutive patients who had undergone a prior MVD >1 year previously. Follow-up data were available for 58 patients, with a median follow-up period of 8.6 years (range, 6.9-10.2 years). The patients were assessed for intraoperative findings, relief results, and complications at discharge and at follow-up, as well as the associations between the preoperative characteristics and outcomes.
   RESULTS: At discharge, of 78 patients with repeat MVD, 72 (92.3%) achieved complete spasm resolution and 1 (2.6%) had significantly improved spasm resolution. Of all patients, 9% (7 of 78) presented short-term complications, including partial hearing loss, hemifacial paresis, and cerebrospinal fluid leak. At follow-up, 45 of 58 (77.6%) patients had complete relief and 10 of 58 (17.2%) had improved relief. Permanent complications occurred in 14 patients (24.1%), with partial hearing loss and mild hemifacial paresis being the most common. Despite the complications, 51 of 58 patients (91.4%) reported an excellent life quality. No significant correlation was found between preoperative characteristics, such as age, interval to prior MVD, or interval to recurrence, and outcomes including short-term or long-term relief results and complications.
   CONCLUSIONS: Repeat MVD provides lasting relief for most patients with persistent or recurrent HFS, albeit with a relatively high complication rate.

AB OBJECTIVE: Decompressive craniectomy (DC) is used to treat intractable intracranial hypertension after severe traumatic brain injury (TBI). Cranioplasty (CP) is typically performed weeks or months later. However, the optimal timing for CP is unknown. We aimed to determine the earliest possible time point for CP.
   METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed brain computed tomography images from 159 patients who underwent CP after DC for TBI at 3 hospitals. We determined the earliest possible day for CP by reviewing the resolution of intracranial pressure in serial brain computed tomography images between DC and CP. The early CP group was defined as the group within the earliest possible timing of CP; other cases constituted the late CP group. We compared complications and the Glasgow Outcome Scale scores at 6 months between groups.
   RESULTS: The mean initial Glasgow Coma Scale score was 8.33 +/- 3.46. The time interval between DC and CP was 94.75 +/- 143.98 days. The earliest possible timing for CP was determined to be 34.60 +/- 34.36 days after DC. The incidence of complications did not differ significantly between groups, except for ventriculomegaly, which occurred more frequently in the late CP group (P = 0.026). Predictors of good outcome were revision because of infection, preoperative epidural hematoma, early cranioplasty, and no ventriculomegaly after DC.
   CONCLUSIONS: CP can be performed at around 34 days after DC for TBI. Ventriculomegaly occurred less frequently and the 6-month Glasgow Outcome Scale score was better in the early CP group than in the late CP group.

AB OBJECTIVE: Operative strategies for cerebral cavernous malformation (CCM)-associated temporal lobe epilepsy and timing of surgical intervention continue to be debated. This study aimed to establish an algorithm to evaluate the efficacy of surgical intervention strategies, to maximize positive surgical outcomes and minimize postsurgical neurologic deficits.
   METHODS: 47 patients having undergone operation for CCM-associated temporal lobe epilepsy were retrospectively reviewed. They had received a diagnostic series for seizure localization, including long-term video electroen-cephalography (vEEG), high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT). In patients with mesial temporal lobe CCMs, the involved structures (amygdala, hippocampus, or parahippocampal gyrus) were resected in addition to the lesions. Patients with neocortical epileptogenic CCM underwent extended lesionectomy guided by intraoperative electrocorticography; further performance of amygdalohippocampectomy depended on the extent of hippocampal epileptogenicity.
   RESULTS: The study cohort contained 28 patients with drug-resistant epilepsy (DRE), 12 with chronic epilepsy (CE), and 7 with sporadic seizure (SS). Normal temporal lobe metabolism was seen in 7/7 patients of the SS group. Hypometabolism was found in all patients with chronic disease except for those with posterior inferior and middle temporal gyrus cavernous malformations (CMs). Of the 31 patients with superficial neocortical CCM, 7 had normal PET without hippocampal sclerosis, 14 had ipsilateral temporal lobe hypometabolism without hippocampal sclerosis, and 10 had obvious hippocampal sclerosis and hypometabolism. Seizure freedom in DRE, CE, and SS was 82.1%, 75%, and 100%, respectively. A significant difference was found between lesion laterality and postoperative seizure control; the rate was lower in left-sided cases because of less aggressive resection.
   CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrates that the data from the presurgical evaluation, particularly regarding CM-location, responsiveness to antiepileptic drugs, and temporal lobe metabolism, are crucial parameters for choosing surgical approaches to CCM-associated temporal lobe epilepsy. By this operative strategy, patients may receive maximized seizure control and minimized postsurgical neurologic sequelae.

AB OBJECTIVE: To evaluate stability of anterior transdiscal axial screw (ATAS) fixation for anterior instrumentation and to compare with standard anterior cervical decompression and fusion and plate (ACDFP) fixation in human subaxial cervical spine.
   METHODS: Flexibility tests were conducted on 7 cadaveric specimens (C5-T1) in an intact and injured state and instrumented with ACDFP fixation, ATAS fixation, and ACDFP plus ATAS fixation at the C6-7 segment after section of the anterior and posterior longitudinal ligaments and discectomy. A pure moment of +/- 2.0 N-m was applied to the specimen in flexion-extension, lateral bending, and axial rotation. Range of motion (ROM) and neutral zone were calculated for the C6-7 segment.
   RESULTS: ROM was reduced significantly compared with the intact or injured condition for 3 configurations under all motions. ATAS fixation resulted in similar ROM in C6-7 compared with ACDFP fixation in flexion (2.7 degrees vs. 2.6 degrees, P = 0.419), extension (2.7 degrees vs. 2.1 degrees, P = 0.152), and lateral bending (4.6 degrees vs. 4.2 degrees, P= 0.295) but largerROMin axial rotation (6.1 degrees vs. 5.3 degrees, P= 0.014). When combined with an anterior plate, ATAS fixation reduced ROMto 1.2 degrees in flexion, 1.1 degrees in extension, 3.3 degrees in lateral bending, and 3.8 degrees in axial rotation, which were significantly smaller than ACDFP or ATAS fixation alone.
   CONCLUSIONS: ATAS fixation is a biomechanically effective alternative or supplemental method of anterior fixation in subaxial cervical spine.

ID POSTERIOR LONGITUDINAL LIGAMENT; CERVICAL-SPINE; MYELOPATHY
AB OBJECTIVE: The degree of hypertrophy of thoracic ossification of ligamentum flavum (TOLF) is related to the severity of the myelopathy. There is no uniform measuring method to calculate the spinal canal occupation ratio (COR) of TOLF simply and effectively. The study was to determine an appropriate measuring method to calculate the COR of TOLF.
   METHODS: A total of 37 computed tomography cross-sectional imaging scans (bone window) from 22 patients were analyzed retrospectively in this study. The ventral side of the lamina or superior facet was selected as bottom in Method 1, and a line perpendicular to the anteroposterior diameter and on the dorsal side of the spinal canal was selected as bottom in Method 2. The maximum thickness of the bilateral ossified mass to the bottom is d1 and d2. The maximum distance from the anterior wall of the spinal canal to the bottom is d. COR of Method 1 or 2 was (d1 + d2)/2d x 100%. Standard COR values calculated by software served as controls.
   RESULTS: The standard COR values were <50% in 10 images, 51%-60% in 9 images, 61%-70% in 10 images, and >71% in 8 images. There was no significant difference between COR1 and COR in every range. There were significant differences between COR2 and COR in the <= 50%, 51%-60%, and 61%-70% groups but they were not statistically significant in the >70% group.
   CONCLUSIONS: Method 1 is a convenient and practical method to measure the COR of ossification in patients with TOLF.

AB Three different methods, acid oxidation, mechanochemical process and ball milling, were used to modify multi walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs). The MWCNTs were dispersed into erythritol (Ery) to prepare composite phase change materials (PCMs). The effects of the MWCNTs on the thermal properties of erythritol-based composite PCMs were studied experimentally. FT-IR and XPS spectroscopy show that hydroxyl groups and carboxylic groups were generated on the surface of the MWCNTs after modification. The pretreatment of MWCNTs can improve their dispersibility in erythritol. When the mass fraction of MWCNTs was 1%, the thermal conductivity of Ery was increased obviously from 0.1956 W/(m.K) to 0.9779 W/(m.K). Besides, the MWCNTs could help improve the supercooling and solidification enthalpy of erythritol significantly. When the mass fraction of A-MWCNTs was only 0.5%, the freezing temperature of PCMs increased from 18.8 degrees C to 58.15 degrees C and the solidification enthalpy increased 50 J/g. After 10 heating and cooling cycles, the Ery/A-MWCNTs composites show a very good thermal cycling stability.

AB The potential benefits of Homogenous Charge Compression Ignition (HCCI) engines are higher thermal efficiency, lower Nitrogen Oxides (NOx) and Particulate Matter (PM) emissions in contrast with conventional engines. This mode of combustion faces its own set of challenges, such as lack of a direct means to control timing initiation of combustion together with higher unburned hydrocarbon and Carbon Monoxide emissions. In the present study, a multi-zone thermo-kinetic model developed to investigate the HCCI engine performance and to predict its emissions. In addition, to determine the optimal HCCI combustion phasing, a grey-box control model used to predict major variables. In order to optimize conditions for higher thermal efficiency and lower emissions, the thereto-kinetic model coupled with a Genetic Algorithm. The octane number and equivalence ratio are two qualitative parameters, which determine the optimal conditions. The grey-box model consists of a combination of physical models and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) models. The steady state and transient validations show that the grey-box model is capable of predicting HCCI engine outputs including combustion phasing, load, THC, CO emissions. By means of coupling the GA and thermos-kinetic model, the optimal engine operating conditions can be derived without the use of test results. The validation results show that the grey-box model is able to predict CA50, IMEP, CO and THC with the average errors of 1.2 CAD, 0.4 bar, 10 PPM, 0.8%, and 394 PPM, respectively.

AB With the development of advanced automation and information technologies, more intelligent meters and measurements are involved in the management of modern district heating systems. A huge amount of measured data can be exploited to technical improvements and environmental protections besides billing purpose. In this paper, a new model is proposed to estimate onsite heat losses of a general pipe network with hourly measurements of heat sources and substations. A detailed heat loss profile along each pipe can be obtained by the proposed model, which can significantly improve the accuracy of the location of damaged insulation. Furthermore, the thermal deterioration of buried pipes can also be evaluated conveniently. In the case study, a real district heating system which has 3 heat sources and 34 substations is analyzed to validate the proposed model. The onsite heat losses of all pipes for 24 h are calculated by the hourly measured data. The results indicate that the heat loss profile of a return pipe is lower and more fluctuating than that of corresponding supply one. The heat losses of selected pipes are nearly 3.51-8.32% more than the reference values, which indicate that selected pipes' insulations are of a little aging or corroded by surrounding soil.

AB This paper proposes approaches to determine the optimal maintenance schedules for offshore wind system such that maintenance cost is minimized. The proposed approaches aim to provide the optimal maintenance schedules for each component using a dynamic approach and for multiple components by proposing an algorithm to optimize grouping multiple maintenance schedules. To increase the accuracy of estimating the maintenance cost in the proposed approaches, a number of impacted parameters such as system reliability, cost effective, weather condition, maintenance duration, power generation loss during maintenance, market electricity price and offshore wind system location are all considered. Firstly, a dynamic maintenance strategy is proposed to determine an optimal individual maintenance schedule for each component in an offshore wind turbine, in which the failure rate and maintenance cost are critical parameters for the cost model. Then, a grouping maintenance optimization strategy is proposed to determine the grouping maintenance schedule which groups multiple maintenance activities to a grouping maintenance activity. The results indicate that the proposed individual maintenance schedule and grouping maintenance schedule may save an average of 2.33% and 4.56% on maintenance cost over baseline maintenance schedule.

AB In this article, the technique of polynomial chaos expansion is combined with an analytic model of thermoelectric power generation to quantify the uncertainty and sensitivity in the performance indices of thermoelectric generation, due to the uncertainty in the temperature-dependent material properties. The Seebeck coefficient, electrical resistivity, and thermal conductivity are given in the form of second-order polynomials in temperature, whose coefficients follow normal probability distributions. The model is used to analytically estimate the mean and standard deviation of the output parameters and to generate cheap ensembles for constructing the probability density functions. The uncertainty in the maximum power density and other associated properties is quantified, and the results are compared to those obtained from direct Monte Carlo simulations. The first-order and total sensitivity indices are also presented. The model can estimate the uncertainty accurately, although the standard deviation in the current density at the maximum power condition has shown some deviation from that of the Monte Carlo simulation. Even the first-order polynomial chaos expansion performs well in our cases, because thermoelectric effects can be essentially considered as a first-order perturbation in thermoelectric generation due to its low energy conversion efficiency.

AB Cogeneration systems are getting more attention due to their high efficiency. These systems can provide different commodities with lower energy consumption; therefore their utilization has decreased fossil fuel consumption throughout the world. In this paper, a new cogeneration system is proposed which is composed of a compressed air energy storage system (CAES), an ORC cycle and an ejector system. The proposed system is capable of producing power, heating and cooling energy. The CAES system is used to produce electricity during the peak hours. The system has been evaluated thermodynamically and effect of different parameters on the system performance has been studied. Finally an optimization process is carried out to find system's optimum performance. The results show that under design condition, the system can produce almost 34 kW power, 25.5 kW heating and 0.3 kW cooling with 68% round trip efficiency. The results of exergy analysis show that approximately half of the plant's total exergy destruction occurs in the combustion chamber. Finally optimization shows that round trip efficiency of the system could increase up to 71.87% which is 5.7% higher than the base case efficiency. It is also indicated that there is an optimum value for ORC turbine inlet pressure and ejector inlet pressure which leads to maximum efficiency of the plant.

AB Artificial neural networks (ANN's) have been used to optimize the performance of a dry reformer with catalyst sintering taken into account. In particular, we study the effects of temperature, pressure and catalyst diameter on the methane and CO2 conversions, as well the H-2 to CO ratio and the molar percentage of solid carbon deposited on the catalyst. The design of the ANN was automated using a genetic algorithm (GA) with indirect binary encoding and an objective function that uses the effective number of parameters provided by Bayesian regularization. Results show that an industrially-acceptable catalyst lifespan for a city reformer can be achieved by periodically optimizing temperatures and pressures to accommodate for the change in catalyst diameter caused by sintering. In particular, it was found that the reactor's operation favors high temperatures of almost 1000 degrees C, while the pressure must be gradually increased from 1 to 5 bars to remain as far as possible from carbon limits and ensure acceptable conversions and molar ratios in the syngas.

AB The pivotal of organic Rankine cycle (ORC) promotion and optimization is revealing the thermodynamic relationship between cycle configuration, condition and its working fluid properties. Different from the traditional numerical calculation method (TNCM) of ORC, a new thermodynamic cycle separating method (TCSM) is introduced in this paper. Then, efficiency of ORC is conducted expediently by TCSM where Triangle cycle eta(TC)), Carrot cycle (eta(CC)) and Brayton cycle (eta(BC)) efficiencies are regarded as variables, that is, eta(SORC) = f (eta(TC),eta(CC),eta(BC)). When comparing with TNCM, TCSM not only has the acceptable precision for all the investigated 21 working fluids, but also the influence of critical temperature, molecular complexity of the working fluid and superheat degree as well as the reduced operating conditions of ORC can be revealed qualitatively and quantitatively. Finally, three conclusions are revealed: (1) Relationship between ORC limited efficiency (the reduced evaporating temperature of 0.9) and critical temperature of working fluid is revealed; (2) When superheat degree increases, ORC efficiency of dry fluid decreases and wet fluid increases linearly, while the variation of isotropic working fluid remains constant; (3) If the reduced temperatures of two different working fluids are equal, the corresponding efficiencies are equal too. The proposed thermodynamic cycle separating method provides an approach for working fluids selection and performance prediction of ORC.

AB Off-design characterization of energy systems has become interesting, especially for waste heat recovery application, where the heat source temperature and mass flow rate can vary over time. Low-grade heat is generally converted into power through ORC modules: the problem of the constant temperature evaporation lead to the definition of alternative architectures, among which organic flash cycles.
   In this work, the off-design behavior of two different architectures of single-stage Organic Flash Cycles has been analyzed in steady-state condition, for small scale waste heat recovery (WHR) purposes. The main difference between the two architecture is the regeneration: in the first architecture (Single-Stage Organic Flash Cycle SS-OFC), the liquid of the flash evaporator, after lamination is mixed with the vapor from the expander and then sent to the condenser; in the second architecture Single-Stage Organic Flash Regenerative Cycle, SS-OFRC, the liquid from the flash evaporator is mixed with the liquid from the condenser, to regenerate the cycle. The most appropriate fluid for the two cycles was selected from a list of sixteen fluids with the objective of minimizing volume flow rates and maximizing the system efficiency and i-Pentane was chosen. For the off-design behavior, a rotary volumetric expander derived from a Wankel engine was considered, taking into account the performance variation of the device at various rotating speed and pressure ratios. Three different control strategies were considered and compared in off-design analysis for both the cycle architectures: sliding-pressure, in which the expander speed was constant and flash pressure varied with the load; sliding-velocity, in which the load was controlled by the speed variation of the expander and flash pressure was retained constant; combined strategy in which the expander speed was varied to drive the flash pressure according to a function which maximized the system efficiency. Results showed that the efficiency of the two cycles was similar in all the operating field whatever was the control strategy considered: SS-OFRC demonstrated a better behavior at low temperatures of the heat source (< 170 degrees C), while SS-OFC had a better efficiency at higher temperature. The maximum absolute efficiency difference in off-design conditions between the two cycles was lower than 0.3%. SS-OFRC however had a wider field of operation than SS-OFC, due to the better flexibility of this type of cycle. As for the control strategy, with both the architectures, combined strategy maximized the system efficiency and flexibility for every temperature and mass flow rate of the heat source considered.

AB Single coal based chemicals production processes emit large amount of CO2 during conversion of the syngas to the high H-2/CO ratio feed gas for chemicals synthesis. However, the feed gas is with a low CO2 molar fraction, leading to high energy cost for CO2 capture. In this work, we try to reduce energy consumption for CO2 capture by improving its molar fraction. A new methanol and power polygeneration process is designed and analysed based on process modeling and simulation. The hierarchical conceptual design methodology is introduced to design the polygeneration more reasonably. In this process, the shifted syngas exiting from the water gas shift unit first goes into the CO2 capture unit to remove CO2. Then, the purified H-2-rich syngas is mixed with the unshifted syngas and fed into the methanol synthesis to produce methanol. Then, unreacted syngas out from the methanol synthesis unit is moderately recycled to use, while the rest is used to generate power. Energy consumption for CO2 capture of the polygeneration process is 0.7 GJ/t-CO2, which is a 40.6% reduction compared to that of the single coal-to-methanol process and a 22.2% reduction to that of coal-to-hydrogen for power generation process. Techno-economic analysis shows that energy saving ratio and primary cost saving ratio are 16.5% and 13.2%, respectively.

AB A compact thermoelectric energy harvester is developed to harvest the thermal energy from the hot surface of the gas turbine, providing continuous and reliable power for the sensing and monitoring system in the gas turbine. An experimental prototype is built and the performances of the energy harvester with different electrical load resistances and source temperatures are characterized. A mathematical iterative method, taking account of Thompson Effect, line spacing gap heat leakage, material property variations, and thermal resistance of the ceramic covering layer, is used to analyze the performance of the segmented thermoelectric generator (TEG) module with good accuracy. Based on this model, the temperature profiles and heat fluxes along the thermoelements, efficiency, and heat leakage through the filling gap material are analyzed. The prototype, with a source temperature of 325 degrees C, has a voltage output of 2.4 V and power output of 0.92 W, which is more than enough to power a sensor node in the gas turbine. A higher power output can be expected with some improvement on the prototype design.

AB n-Butanol is an option of biofuel with potential to be used in the transportation industry. There is little information about performance of engines running with this alcohol and thus is very difficult to evaluate its advantages. A way to bypass this limitation is to use numerical simulation, mainly 1D models, to represent the whole engine and preview its performance running with different fuels. The lack of information about n-butanol and its combustion properties are big challenges to surpass when building these virtual models. A way to overcome these challenges is numerically model an engine and adjust the fuel properties until the numerical results are in agreement with test results. The aim of this work is to estimate fuel properties of an n-butanol-gasoline blend by means of numerical simulation, allowing the comparison of its performance against other fuels. Starting with a virtual engine model, the fuel properties were adjusted based on test measurements until a good agreement between numerical results and measured results was obtained. After numerical calibration, some of the main n-butanol fuel parameters (BU40) needed by 1D codes were obtained, like liquid fuel heat of vaporization @ 298 K = 583 kJ/kg, density = 813 kg/m(3), liquid fuel abs. entropy @ 298 K = 3015.78 J/kg-K, critical temperature = 563 K, critical pressure = 4.5 MPa, gaseous fuel abs. entropy @ 298 K = 4723.79 J/kg-K, among others. The properties thus obtained leaded to well approximated results, where numerical to experimental results for indicated mean effective pressure (IMEP) are lower than 0.1 bar, lower than 8% for peak cylinder pressure (PCP) and lower than 7% for rate of heat release (ROHR).

AB In this study, human feces were hydrothermal liquefied and converted into biocrude over Ni-Tm/TiO2 catalyst. The influence of catalysts, reaction temperature, and holding time on the distribution of products and element content of biocrude was assessed. The biocrude yield increased to 53.16% with a reaction temperature of 330 degrees C, a holding time of 30 min, and adding Ni-Tm/TiO2 catalyst while the liquefaction conversion peaked at 89.61%. The biocrude had an HMV of 36.64 MJ/kg and was similar to heavy crude oil. The biocrude is rich in fatty acid amides, esters, and oxygen-containing-only heteroatom-ring compounds as well as some nitrogen-containing heteroatom-ring compounds. The main gaseous products were CO2, CH4, and C2H6. Hydrothermal liquefaction over Ni-Tm/TiO2 catalyst could be a potential method to handle human excrement treatment and produce biofuel.

AB The present work reports on the study of biofuel production from biooil obtained by cardoon pyrolysis (Cynara cardunculus L.). The main process was carried out at 700 degrees C and at 50 cm(3) min(-1) nitrogen flow rate for 1 h. The liquid yield in such pyrolysis process was 38.91% (wt/wt). Two solvents were used for biofuel extraction, namely ethyl ether and ethyl acetate, to achieve a 34.72% yield in biofuel. Subsequently, a distillation process in the range of kerosene (200-275 degrees C) was performed to finally obtain "biokerosene", which was used to feed both a self-manufactured jet engine and an internal combustion engine (ICE). In the jet engine, experimental tests were run for four kerosene/biofuel mixtures in the range 0-20% biofuel, in atmospheric conditions (20 degrees C and 1015 mbar) and setting the engine in a slightly sloped arrangement in order to prevent excessive displacements. Fuel pressure at maximum power was recorded as 6 bar, which yielded 0.00252 kg s(-1) fuel flow rate. Results-even for the mixture with 20% biofuel content- were found to be similar to those for pure kerosene. The turbocharger yield was 74% with 200,000 rpm and 0.091 kg s(-1) air flow rate for all conditions, which equates to an approximate power of 100 hp for the use of the turbocharger in self-propulsion. On another note, the ICE was operated using a 80-20% diesel-biokerosene mix and was observed to show a satisfactory behaviour in terms of torque and power yields. The use of such biofuels to feed jet and ICE engines represents an excellent alternative to fossil fuels, and therefore quality improvement is a key topic for further research in the area.

AB This study investigated the direct supplementation of sodium chlorite (NaClPO2) in acidic fermentation process rather than using NaClO2 as a pretreatment agent. This approach targets saving both of the cost of external acetic acid that needs to be added in pretreatment and the loss of polysaccharide, which simultaneously occurs during pretreatment process. Whereas, fermentation of water hyacinth (WH) provided quite low H-2 yield (HY) of 39.7 +/- 2.5 mL/g(TVS) and lignin destruction of 2.6 +/- 0.2%. Cellulase and xylanase enzymes amounted to 2.15 +/- 0.18 and 1.81 +/- 0.14 U/mL, respectively. Enterobacter and Clostridium sp. accounted for 2.41 +/- 0.15 x 10(5) and 4.02 +/- 0.27 x 10(4) cfu/mL, respectively. However, NaClO2 addition significantly augmented HY, cellulase and xylanase enzymes to 119.6 +/- 7.8 mL/g(TVS), 3.46 +/- 0.21 and 2.09 +/- 0.23 U/mL at dosage of 8.0 mg/L, respectively. Moreover, cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin degradation efficiencies were maximized to 57.8 +/- 3.1, 46.3 +/- 3.8 and 31.6 +/- 1.6%, respectively. Enterobacter and Clostridium sp. counts were 4.23 +/- 0.28 x 10(5) and 9.75 +/- 0.52 x 10(4) cfu/mL, respectively in the batches supplemented with NaClO2. Nevertheless, at a dosage exceeding 8.0 mg/L, the HY (26.1 +/- 2.0 mL/g(TVS)) and bacterial count was highly deteriorated due to the excessive production of inhibitory phenolic compounds of 1.61 +/- 0.12 g/L in the medium where the destruction of lignin was quite high (38.8 +/- 2.4%).

AB Performance of a small-scale trigeneration system driven by low-temperature geothermal sources for producing fresh water, heating (hot water) and electricity is investigated from thermodynamic and economic standpoints. This system, utilizing a single stage absorption heat transformer leads to an increase in heat source temperature to be used in single stage evaporation desalination process and also providing water heating. Furthermore, an organic Rankine cycle is used for electric power generation. The developed model is validated with available data and effects of decision variables namely geothermal source, absorber and condenser temperatures on energy and exergy efficiencies of the overall system, power to water ratio and levelized cost of energy (LCOE) are investigated. The findings show that the increase in absorber and condenser temperatures leads to lower energy and exergy efficiencies, and higher LCOE and these effects are more significant at lower geothermal temperatures. Moreover, it is estimated that LCOE of proposed system is by far lower than that of a sole ORC powered with low geothermal water sources, whereas levelized cost of water (LCOW) is just comparable with small-scale membrane desalination processes. Utilizing a 100 degrees C geothermal water, the proposed system has a production capacity of 0.662 kg/s fresh water, 161.5 kW power, and 246 kW heat load.

AB This experimental work investigates the operational limits of the reactivity controlled compression ignition combustion concept in a light-duty single-cylinder diesel engine using the stock compression ratio (17.1:1) with specific constraints. In addition, the effects of using different direct-injected fuels on engine-out emissions and performance are analyzed. First, an engine mapping was performed using diesel and gasoline as direct-injected and port-injected fuels, respectively. The operational limits of the reactivity controlled compression ignition concept have been found to be confined in the region defined from 2 to 5 bar indicated mean effective pressure at 1000 rev/min and from 4 to 8 bar indicated mean effective pressure at 3000 rev/min. In that portion of the map, nitrogen oxides and smoke emissions were below 0.4 g/kW h and 0.1 filter smoke number simultaneously, and the engine mechanical limits were respected. Later, the effects of the direct-injected fuel properties have been evaluated at the points that define the frontiers of maximum and minimum engine load in the baseline engine map (diesel/gasoline). To do this, three additional fuels based on diesel-gasoline mixings at different ratios (90%-10%, 70%-30% and 50%-50%), also known as dieseline, were used as direct-injected fuel instead of 100% diesel. To isolate the effects of each direct-injected fuel, the same engine settings were used for the comparison. The results show that, as the reactivity gradient between the high and low reactivity fuel diminishes, the sequential autoignition achieved in reactivity controlled compression ignition due to local combustion reactions switches to a more kinetically controlled homogeneous charge compression ignition-like combustion process. Finally, all the fuels were found to be capable of operating inside the emissions restrictions imposed by doing little modifications on the baseline calibration. However, no clear potential was found versus using 100% diesel as high-reactivity fuel.

AB In the study, biochar was easily produced from bio-oil distillation residue through a tube furnace at a broad induction temperature range of 200-700 degrees C under nitrogen and carbon dioxide. The comparative evolution of biochar was characterized by evaluating its physicochemical properties including elements, calorific values, functional groups, graphitization degree and thermal stability. The results showed that compared with nitrogen atmosphere, carbon dioxide first contributed to biochar yield. After 600 degrees C, biochar yield in carbon dioxide dropped rapidly, while nitrogen had little effect on biochar yield. Through bomb calorimeter, the maximum calorific value of biochar was 34.13 MJ.kg(-1) at 200 degrees C under carbon dioxide. Based on elements analysis, O/C, H/C and N/C of biochar induced by nitrogen were higher than those of carbon dioxide. Fourier transform infrared spectrometry (FTIR) indicated that induction temperature and atmosphere selectively affected the evolution of biochar functional groups. C=O stretching vibration in carbon dioxide was more durable than that in nitrogen, whereas the stretching vibration of -CH2 and C-C had opposite phenomenon. In addition to 200 degrees C, the biochar under nitrogen possessed less graphitization with temperature increasing by Raman spectra analysis. Furthermore, the biochar induced by nitrogen was more stable than that induced by carbon dioxide according to the thermogravimetric analysis.

AB Generally, > 40% of the useful energy (cooling engine and exhaust gases) are wasted by a biogas power plant through the cooling radiator and the exhaust gases. An efficient way to convert this waste heat into work and eventually electricity is the use of an organic Rankine cycle (ORC) power system. Over the last few years, different architectures have been widely investigated (subcritical, wet expansion and trans-critical). Despite the promising performances, realistic economic and technical constraints, also related to the application, are required for a meaningful comparison between ORC technologies and architectures. Starting from the limited literature available, the aim of the present paper is to provide a methodology to compare sub-critical, trans critical and wet expansion cycles and different types of expanders (both volumetric and turbomachinery) from both technical and economic point of view, which represent one of the main novel aspects of the present work. In particular, the paper focuses on the thermo-economic optimization of an ORC waste heat recovery unit for a 500 kWe biogas power plant located in a detailed regional market, which was not investigated yet. By means of a genetic algorithm, the adopted methodology optimizes a given economic criteria (Pay-Back Period, Net Present Value, Profitability Index and Internal Rate of Return) while respecting technical constraints (expander limitations) and thermodynamic constraints (positive pinch points in heat exchangers, etc.).
   The results show that optimal ORC solutions with a potential of energy savings up to 600 MWh a year and with a pay-back period lower than 3 years are achievable in the regional market analysed.

AB In this study a probabilistic approach for optimal sizing of cogeneration systems under long-term uncertainty in energy demand is proposed. A dynamic simulation framework for detailed modeling of the energy system is defined, consisting in both traditional and optimal operational strategies evaluation. A two-stage stochastic optimization algorithm is developed, adopting Monte Carlo method for the definition of a multi-objective optimization problem. An Italian hospital facility has been used as a case study and a gas internal combustion engine is considered for the cogeneration unit. The results reveal that the influence of uncertainties on both optimal size and annual total cost is significant. Optimal size obtained with the traditional deterministic approach are found to be sub-optimal (up to 30% larger) and the predicted annual cost saving is always lower when accounting for uncertainties. Pareto frontiers of different CHP configurations are presented and show the effectiveness of the proposed method as a useful tool for risk management and focused decision-making, as tradeoffs between system efficiency and system robustness.

AB With growing wind turbine sizes and increasing demands for electricity, it is important to determine accurately wind shear profile, up to high altitudes, for large scale wind turbine installation. The installed wind turbine towers in Iran have hardly exceeded the height of 40 m. In this study, the effectiveness of different extrapolation methods are investigated to determine robustly wind speed and wind power density at higher altitudes. As a case study, wind data was collected from the center of Iran which consists of 35 wind stations in nine provinces. For precise evaluation, the wind speed data were recorded based on 10-min average at various heights ranging from 10 m to 100 m and the wind power potential was obtained on both seasonally and daily basis. The widely used Weibull distribution function is selected for which the shape factor and scale parameter are determined using the standard deviation method, the empirical method of Lysen and the power density method at different heights. From the extrapolated wind data, the mean wind speed, wind power density, optimal wind speed, probability and cumulative density distributions are obtained and the geographic information systems maps are produced and discussed. The results indicate that the power density method is the most accurate method for extrapolating wind characteristics. From the results, it is also observed that variation of power density with time is significant. In period I (spring and summer), most parts of the center of Iran have significant potential for installing large scale wind turbines. However in period II (fall and winter), the amount of wind power density decreases considerably. In overall, the north western and north eastern parts of the center of Iran are recommended for large scale wind turbine installation. The methodology discussed here can be equally employed for extrapolating of wind speeds data at any heights within any geographical region.

AB We present the development, coupling, and application of a quasi-3D multiphysics model of a notional all electric ship electromagnetic launcher (EML) and a dynamic parallel-flow heat exchanger (PFHX) model to devise effective thermal management strategies for naval EMLs. The EML model combines a 2D electromagnetic thermal model and a 3D thermal-fluid model developed based on the fundamental laws of electromagnetism, heat transfer, and fluid dynamics. Similarly, we applied the conservation laws to formulate a PFHX model and nondimensionalized it by identifying dimensionless parameters that pertained to the effectiveness-NTH method. We solved the coupled EML-PFHX model using finite element method and employed it to investigate the following aspects of naval EML thermal management: the effects of (1) thermal diffusion in the rail, (2) PFHX design and operation, and (3) cooling channel location on cooling performance and heat reversal. Subsequently, we deduced the following from our study: (1) thermal diffusion effectively assists the cooling channel with peak temperature reduction, and its contribution to the determination of optimal channel allocation is non-trivial; (2) improvement in cooling performance is not always directly proportional to larger heat exchanger size and higher flow rate increased flow rate and NTU only result in higher pumping power as well as heat exchanger cost and volume without significant improvement in cooling performance beyond the optimal design and operating point; (3) placing the cooling channel close to the initial hot spot in the rail yields inferior cooling performance at high mass flow rate with 10 s of cooling and exacerbates the heat-reversal effect; and (4) optimal cooling channel allocation must therefore base on the given mass flow rate and cooling period placing the channel near the initial hot spot is favorable for lower mass flow rates and shorter cooling periods, whereas channels should be placed at the rail center for equidistant heat flow from all four corners in the opposite case.

AB Solar based cooling systems may assume various configurations depending upon the manner in which the individual system components are inter-connected and the adopted control scheme. In this study, simulation based performance analysis of a solar assisted single effect absorption cooling system is done for two system configurations in TRNSYS. The analysis is carried out to meet a peak cooling demand of 298 kW for an educational building located in Islamabad (33.71 degrees N, 73.06 degrees E). In configuration-1 (C-1), the working fluid returning from the generator of the absorption chiller always flows towards the hot storage tank which acts as a common element between the solar collector and the absorption chiller. In configuration-2 (C-2), the working fluid returning from the absorption chiller may become isolated from the collector-storage tank loop if the fluid temperature in the storage tank is less than the required temperature (i.e. 110 degrees C) and is directly fed to the auxiliary boiler. Both system configurations are fully modelled in TRNSYS and dynamic simulations are run for the entire summer season. Various performance factors such as solar fraction, collector efficiency and primary energy savings are evaluated to optimize the key system design variables which include collector tilt, storage volume, type and size of the solar collector. Simulation results demonstrate that for the whole summer season, C-2 with flat plate or evacuated tube solar collectors always results in higher primary energy savings than C-1. However, on the basis of solar fraction and monthly collector efficiency, difference between C-1 and C-2 is estimated to be marginal. Overall, C-2 in conjunction with evacuated tube collectors (ETC) results in minimum collector area per kilowatt of cooling demand and higher monthly collector efficiency than C-1.

AB The field of second generation production process has immense potential to utilize and convert lignocellulosic biomass to biofuels and biochemicals. Among these, enzyme pretreated biomass specifically treated by oxido-reductive group of enzymes is gaining attention towards bioethanol production. Until now research has been focused towards biofuels and biochemicals production based on the physical, chemical and physic-chemical methods. Biological processes on the other hand are eco-friendly and sustainable in nature and are gaining more attention towards biofuels/biochemicals generation. Moreover, biomass feasibility in terms of availability and sugar content is still one of the major challenges in bioenergy sector. The present article emphasizes process integration for bioethanol production by utilizing laccase pretreated lignocellulosic feedstock. In the present study we have attempted to combine the different processes together for bioethanol production and compared it with the single process. The fermentation process has been optimized through response surface methodology that resulted in 63.2 gL(-1) of ethanol for partial simultaneous saccahrification and fermentation (P-SSF) and 57.91 gL(-1) of ethanol for simultaneous saccharification and fermentation (SSF) within 25-28 h. The surface area, pore size, and pore volume of the fermented biomass is found to be decreased after SSF and P-SSF that indicates extensive action of enzymes. Microscopic study showed surface distortion of the biomass after fermentation that revealed the effective action of saccahrifying enzymes on biomass during hydrolysis and fermentation. The obtained X-ray diffraction pattern showed the utilization of amorphous and crystalline cellulose which initially increased to 8.03% and thereafter decreased to 23.49%. Thus, the findings obtained in the present study supports the feasibility of the enzymatically pretreated biomass for bioethanol production.

AB Phase change materials are promising options for thermal energy storage and thermal energy devices. However, their low thermal conductivity lowers their charging and discharging rate. In this paper, copper foam was utilized to enhance the thermal performance of the paraffin. A visible experimental device was built to investigate the melting behavior of paraffin with and without copper foam. The effect of the heating position on the thermal performance of copper foam/paraffin composite phase change material (CPCM) was also discussed. The heat transfer characteristics including solid-liquid interface development, temperature distribution and wall temperature of the heater were tested and recorded. In addition, a numerical model was established using one temperature volume averaging method to analyze the melting process of the CPCM. The experimental results showed that the total melting time of the CPCM was 20.5% shorter than that of pure paraffin, and the CPCM heated at the top melted slowest and reached the biggest temperature difference in the three heating conditions, so the effect of natural convection on the melting process of the CPCM could not be neglected. A two dimensional numerical simulation was also performed to analyze the melting behavior of CPCM, and the numerical results were well consistent with the experimental data.

AB A novel self-heat system which consists of a coal and biomass co-gasification process, low-temperature air separation based on the LNG vaporization, steam cycle, supercritical CO2 power generation unit and cryogenic carbon dioxide capture section is introduced and analyzed. Some new aspects of this study can be categorized as follows. There is no need to implement external heat sources and refrigeration units. Suitable process integration significantly decreases energy consumption and the heaters and coolers can be eliminated. Co-gasifier produces high yield synthesis gas to supply power and heat energy. The required pure oxygen (99.99%) for gasification is supplied from ASU. The specific energy required for high purity oxygen production is about 0.11 kW h/kg. The results show that the cold gas efficiency of gasifier is 81%. Also due to sufficient integration between LNG vaporization and other subsystems, 40459.53 kW energy is saved in the system. In cryogenic CO2 capture unit, 0.10 kW h/kg-CO2 is required to separate 99% carbon dioxide. Moreover, exergy and sensitivity analyses are carried out on the integrated process. Exergy efficiency and exergy destruction have been calculated for the main equipment of the system. The overall exergy destruction rate of the process is around 1.007 x 105 kW and heat exchangers have the highest portion of irreversibility. Finally, the effect of some significant parameters on the performance of the units is studied.

AB Overheating of silicon PV panels due to excessive solar irradiance and high environmental temperatures is a major problem especially in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region. The temperature of PV panels can easily go up to 75 degrees C in such regions, which corresponds to a drop in efficiency of about 25%. An innovative solution is presented in this research to minimize overheating of PV panels, and that is based on natural convection. Through holes are drilled in the PV panel to assist the uprising of the hot boundary layer under the panel causing cooling of the panel. Experiments have been performed to proof the idea, and then numerical simulations are performed for further exploration of the influence of the hole size and number of holes. It was found that the temperature of the perforated PV panels is lower than the temperature of the non-perforated panels, and that temperature difference increases with increasing number of holes. However, there is a critical diameter for the hole size, such that before and after that diameter the temperature of the PV panel increases. It can be concluded from the performed research that adding through holes in the PV panel is a passive cooling technique that can minimize overheating of the panel.

AB Fast and accurate parameter extraction of solar cell models is always desired for simulation, evaluation and maximum energy harvesting of PV systems. This paper proposes an improved shuffled complex evolution (ISCE) algorithm for parameter extraction of different PV models, including single diode model, double diode model and single diode solar module model. The novelty of proposed ISCE algorithm lies primary in the improved competitive complex evolution strategy, where three amendments are proposed to overcome the shortcomings of original SCE algorithm. (1) The expansion step and outside contraction step are inserted into to improve the probability of producing better solution. (2) The reflecting-absorbing bound- handling method is employed to enhance the chance of global search and avoid being trapped in local minima. (3) The main diagonal of simplex is adopted to overcome local roughness and drive the global search in an efficient manner. In order to test the parameter extraction performance of proposed ISCE and compare it with some state-of-the-art algorithms, the standard datasets and practical measured datasets of one solar cell and three solar modules are selected for parameter extraction of different PV models. Comparison results indicate that the proposed ISCE algorithm always exhibits the highest computational efficiency to get the most accurate parameter values among all compared algorithms. More importantly, the proposed ISCE algorithm generally promises better convergence speed and robustness than the best reported algorithms. Due to these superiorities, the proposed ISCE algorithm is quite promising and envisaged to be an accurate, efficient and reliable alternative for solving the parameter extraction problem of solar cell models.

AB Employing phase change materials (PCMs) for latent heat storage (LHS) application has a great potential to improve a solar thermal system performance. Despite this fact, the use of PCM in this area is quite limited due to the poor thermal conductivity of available PCMs. Therefore, heat transfer enhancement is one of the essential strategies that can overcome this obstacle. In this paper and related project, a PCM heat exchanger (HX) is purposely designed with spiral-wired tubes and integrated in an indirect solar assisted heat pump test system. Although the spiral-wired tube has not been applied in a PCM HX, it is expected to enhance significantly the PCM heat transfer and heat storage performance. To verify this and understand the PCM heat storage and releasement processes, a detailed 3D CFD model has been developed for the PCM HX and validated with measurements. The temperature variations and visualizations of the PCM during charging and discharging processes are therefore simulated and presented temporally. Furthermore, the effects of different inlet heat transfer fluid flow rates and temperatures on the PCM melting/solidification time are demonstrated in this study. Some significant simulation results have been obtained which can instruct efficiently the operation of the heat exchanger and its integration with the solar system.

DE Defrost; Heater; Refrigerator; Efficiency

AB The defrosting method of the conventional household refrigerator increases freezer temperature during the defrosting operation, and defrosting efficiency reduces because the heater consumes more power than the amount of frost on the surface of the heat exchanger. To solve this problem, three defrost heater control methods, applicable to refrigerators equipped with conduction and radiation heaters, are being proposed. The control methods were classified as a method of simultaneously pulsating two heaters, method of individually pulsating two heaters, and method of step-by-step reduction of radiation heater power. The operation effect of each heater on freezer temperature was analyzed. For the three methods, a heater control optimization process was performed to reduce the temperature increase in the freezer. The power consumed by the heater was minimized and defrosting efficiency improved. The Best performance was observed when two heaters pulsated individually. For this method, the variation in freezer temperature, between before and after the defrost process, was reduced from approximately 11 degrees C to 5 degrees C. Additionally, the defrosting efficiency improved by 15%.

AB Based on the weak dissipative assumption, a more universal thermodynamic model of the pumped thermal electricity storage (PTES) system is established, where the main irreversibilities are considered and several key operating parameters are introduced. Analytic expressions for some key performance parameters, e.g., the round trip efficiency (RTE), heat pumping rate, and power output, etc. of the PTES system are derived. The upper boundaries of the RTE at the maximum power output and the maximum RTE for some given parameters are determined. The optimally operating regions of several parameters operating at different modes are determined. Notably, a generalized thermodynamic model of weak dissipative electrical energy storage (EES) systems is proposed, and consequently, the results obtained from the PTES system may be applied directly to reveal the performance characteristics of these EES systems.

AB A novel zero-carbon-emission system for producing high-purity hydrogen and carbon nanoparticles was proposed in this paper. Concentrated solar energy as the only energy source was utilized in a cascaded way. That is to say, concentrated solar energy was first used to provide heat with high temperature for the thermal cracking of methane, and then used to drive the heat-to-power cycle for the output of mechanical work or electricity. The produced mechanical work or electricity was used for separating hydrogen from the unreacted methane based on the membrane technology. The performances of the whole system and its major facilities were studied through the first law thermodynamics. The results showed that, receiver loses about 35% of the input energy due to the high operating temperature, and about 59% of the input energy is used for the purification of hydrogen. The system performance is mainly affected by four key parameters including the heat loss of receiver, the conversion rate of methane in the reactor, the operating pressure of the membrane separator, and the heat-to-power rate of the power generation cycle. Decreasing the operating pressure of the membrane separator is one of the most efficient ways to improve the system efficiency. With the partial pressure of hydrogen in the retentive-side of separator decreasing from 791 to 200 kPa, the ideal system efficiency increases from 0.4 to 0.8.

AB A new chemical looping air separation (CLAS) system, which is composed of a combined heat and power (CHP) unit and two fixed-bed reactors (FBRs), is developed for trigeneration of electricity, oxygen, and nitrogen simultaneously. Based on the specific oxidation conditions of the elevated oxidation pressure and the oxidation temperature higher than the reduction temperature, the alternate operation of two FBRs is operated periodically to avoid the solid looping cycles. Through exergy analysis of the CLAS using different oxygen carriers, the Mn-based CLAS has the lower exergy efficiency than using other oxygen carriers but it has benefits with low methane depletion rate and small reactor size. By solving a multi-objective optimization algorithm for minimizing the methane depletion rate and reactor size, the Pareto-optimal front of the Mn-based CLAS shows that the exergy efficiency improvement would increase the fuel consumption, enlarge the reactor size and reduce the feasible objective region. Through exergoeconomic analysis of the Mn-based CLAS, the specific oxidation conditions could obviously increase the exergy destruction cost of the oxidation reaction but it can be compensated by the relative cost differences of the CHP units.

AB For modern horizontal axis wind turbines (WTs), a yaw drive mechanism is utilized to adjust the nacelle position to face the wind direction. Depending on historical signals from wind direction sensors, conventional yaw control methods could not provide sufficient performance in tracking winds, and thus result in a reduction of wind power extraction. This issue needs to be tackled using advanced control solutions. Taking advantage of predicted wind directions, a novel control solution is proposed in this study. Specifically, the proposed solution refers to a novel control structure that consists of a wind direction predictive model and a novel yaw control method. Under the proposed control structure, a hybrid autoregressive integrated moving average method-based Kalman filter (ARIMA-KF) model is used to predict the wind direction, and two novel yaw control methods are proposed: one created by using the predicted wind direction as the tracking reference, and the other based on a model predictive control (MPC) using a finite control set. To demonstrate the feasibility and the superiority of the proposed solution, two novel yaw controllers are developed and tested through some simulation tests using industrial data. Their performance is compared to the one of two industrial yaw controllers. Comparison results show that the two novel yaw controllers are capable of reducing yaw error, and thus increase wind power extraction for the WTs. Meanwhile, it is noticeable that the MPC-based controller has an advantage in the aspect of reducing yaw actuator usage.

AB A novel hydrogen production plant is proposed, including a thermochemical water decomposition cycle, a pressurized entrained flow gasifier, a water gas shift membrane reactor, a cryogenic air separation unit, a hydrogen-fueled combined cycle for power production and a hydrogen compression system. The syngas produced by the pressurized entrained flow gasifier undergoes the shift reaction in the water gas shift membrane reactor. The stripping of hydrogen is done simultaneously with the shift reaction in the water gas shift membrane reactor to capture more hydrogen and increase the shift reaction conversion percentage. The remaining syngas is combusted in the Brayton cycle and power is produced through Brayton cycle gas turbine. The hot exhausts exiting the Brayton cycle gas turbine goes to the heat recovery steam generation unit where steam is produced. The generated steam goes to the copper-chlorine cycle to produce hydrogen. Part of the power generated by the Brayton cycle is used for the electrolysis reactor in the copper-chlorine cycle. Then, a small part of the hydrogen produced passes to the combined cycle to overcome the needed work rate by the components in the plant. The remaining larger portion of the hydrogen produced goes to the compression system to compress hydrogen to 700 bar for storage. The hydrogen production plant is developed and modeled in the Aspen Plus software package. Energy and exergy analyses are performed on the hydrogen production integrated system. The overall energy and exergy efficiencies of the proposed hydrogen production plant are found to be 51.3% and 47.6% respectively.

AB This paper establishes a thermo-mechanical model considering the liquid density variation to explore the comprehensive energy storage performance of two types of small-sized encapsulated phase change materials (PCMs) as well as effects of shell thickness. The study shows that the varying ranges of internal pressure, melting temperature and latent heat are markedly diminished during melting of PCMs after taking into account the liquid density variation. The decrease of shell thickness leads to a decrease of maximum internal pressure and a larger decrease of critical cracking pressure, which will increase the risk of shell cracking. The decrease in shell thickness slows down the increase in melting temperature and the decrease in latent heat during the melting process, which consequently reduces the melting time and increases the stored latent energy. These results indicate that reducing shell thickness of encapsulated PCMs is favourable for elevating energy charging rate and energy storage capacity while it is harmful to mechanical stability. The Cu/Ni capsule has smaller critical core/shell size ratio to avoid cracking than the salts/SiC capsule, while the former offers a shorter melting period. This implies that physical properties of materials of PCM capsules should be carefully considered for improving mechanical stability and melting dynamics. This study is helpful for selection of appropriate shell thickness and materials to achieve excellent comprehensive energy storage performance of encapsulated PCMs.

AB In the present study, a new power and refrigeration cycle is investigated which is a combination of a Kalina cycle and an ejector refrigeration cycle (ERC). In the proposed configuration of the combined cycle, an ejector refrigeration cycle is inserted into the Kalina cycle to recover heat from ammonia poor solution which leaves the separator at high temperature/pressure and does not contribute to power generation in Kalina cycle Working fluid of the Kalina cycle and ERC are ammonia-water solution and R134a, respectively. The combined cycle is simulated by EES software and details of the applied mathematical model and developed simulation program are extensively reported. The effect of five key operational parameters of the combined cycle (i.e. turbine inlet pressure, turbine inlet temperature, concentration of ammonia-water basic solution, condenser outlet temperature and pressure of refrigerant in heat exchanger) on the combined cycle performance parameters (refrigeration capacity, power production, thermal efficiency, exergy of produced power, exergy of refrigeration and exergy efficiency) is analyzed and physical mechanisms behind the determined results are reported. Additionally, variation of performance parameters with heat exchanger pressure is examined with different refrigerants (R134a, R152a and R290) to determine the effect of refrigerants on system performance. The results show that thermal efficiency of the combined cycle increases with increasing turbine inlet temperature and concentration of ammonia-water solution but decreases with rising condenser outlet temperature and heat exchanger pressure. A maximum thermal efficiency point is determined in the analyzed range of the turbine inlet pressure. Exergy efficiency increases with rising turbine inlet pressure, turbine inlet temperature and concentration of ammonia-water solution but decreases with increasing condenser outlet temperature and heat exchanger pressure. Refrigeration capacity and thermal efficiency results of the combined cycle are the highest for the operation of ERC with R290 and the lowest with R134a. Exergy efficiency is,the lowest for ERC operation with R290 and the highest with R134a.

AB Faults and malfunctions occurring in engineering systems may cause additional resources consumptions and economic expenditures, thus their detection and isolation is of great practical significance. The procedure to discover faults is known as diagnosis, and it can be based on different techniques, depending on the purpose of the analysis: to predict the failure time of the component, or to quantify the inefficiencies of the system due to the anomaly. Among the existing approaches adopted to diagnose the energy systems, Thermoeconomic diagnosis provides useful information to detect the anomalies and to quantify its negative impacts. However, this method does not allow to identify possible strategies useful to reduce the inefficiencies caused by anomalies, which could be a crucial need for the system operator.
   To face this issue, this article proposes a method to perform Thermoeconomic diagnosis of energy systems that enables the analyst to understand the interdependencies between the components, and decomposing the main indicator resulting from Thermoeconomic diagnosis, known as malfunction. The method provides useful information for the system operators to define practical strategies to reduce the negative effects of malfunctions. This approach is also formalized and applied to the CGAM benchmark to highlight the practical achievements of this approach with numerical values. It is found that the proposed approach provides useful insight about the effects of malfunctions, and it may be helpful for system operators to reduce the negative impacts of the anomaly by pinpointing the component with higher contribution in total inefficiency of the system. In this specific case, proper intervention on the pinpointed component mitigated the total inefficiency of the system by almost 40%, and recovered the reference efficiency of the system.

AB Background: Previous studies suggest an inverse correlation between asthma and altitude. In the present work, we performed an in-depth analysis of asthma incidence in the 758 Mexican counties covered by the largest medical institution in the country (similar to 37.5 million insured subjects), and evaluated its relationships with altitude and other factors.
   Methods: Asthma incidence in each county was calculated from new cases diagnosed by family physicians. Other variables in the same counties, including selected diseases, geographical variables, and socioeconomic factors, were also obtained and their association with asthma was evaluated through bivariate and multivariate analyses.
   Results: Median asthma incidence was 296.2x100,000 insured subjects, but tended to be higher in those counties located on or near the coast. When asthma incidence was plotted against altitude, a two-stage pattern was evident: asthma rates were relatively stable in counties located below an altitude of similar to 1500 m, while these rates progressively decreased as altitude increased beyond this level (r(S) = -0.51, p < .001). Multivariate analysis showed that, once each variable was adjusted by the potential influence of the others, asthma incidence was inversely correlated with altitude (standardized beta coefficient, -0.577), helminthiasis (-0.173), pulmonary tuberculosis (-0.130), and latitude (-0.126), and was positively correlated with acute respiratory tract infection (0.382), pneumonia (0.289), type 2 diabetes (0.138), population (0.108), and pharyngotonsillitis (0.088), all with a p <= .001.
   Conclusion: Our study showed that altitude higher than similar to 1500 m comprises a major factor in determining asthma incidence, with the risk of new-onset asthma decreasing as altitude increases. Other less influential conditions were also identified.

AB Introduction: In countries where smoking is associated with lower socioeconomic status, smokers tend to perform worse on cognitive tasks than non-smokers. China is now undergoing a similar process with a recent study showing that there is a reduced cognitive performance in middle aged but not in elderly smokers. We examined the links between smoking status and cognitive functioning among vocational school students in Beijing, China.
   Methods: A total of 213 students aged 16-20 (98 smokers and 115 non-smokers) were recruited from three vocational schools in Beijing. Participants completed three subtests of Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS) (information, arithmetic, digit span) and Dysexecutive Questionnaire (DEX). Smokers also completed a cigarette smoking questionnaire and Fagerstrom Test of Nicotine Dependence (FTND).
   Results: Smokers performed worse than non-smokers in tests of arithmetic and digit span forward (t = 4.25, 2.05, both P < .05). Scores on digit span backward did not differentiate smokers and non-smokers, but among smokers, the performance on this subtest was related to the age of starting smoking (r = 0.26, p < .001). Cognitive performance in smokers was not related to tobacco dependence or intensity of smoking. Compared to non-smokers, smokers had a higher total DEX score and higher scores on three of its five subscales (Inhibition, Knowing-doing dissociation and Social regulation, all p < .05). Another subscale, In-resistance, did not differentiate smokers and non-smokers, but differentiated smokers with lower and higher levels of nicotine dependence (t=-2.12, p < .05).
   Conclusion: Smokers performed worse on some cognitive tasks than non-smokers and scored higher on a questionnaire assessing executive dysfunction.

AB Background: Respiratory disease is a common co-morbidity with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). RA commonly affects the hands, but there is little research investigating whether these patients are physically able to operate inhalers.
   Aim: To compare the physical ability of people with and without RA to use four commonly prescribed inhaler devices (pressurised metered dose inhaler (pMDI), Easi-Breathe (R), HandiHaler (R) and Turbohaler (R)).
   Methods: Adults with RA and an equal number of age-sex matched controls were observed using placebo inhaler devices. Maximum inhalation flow rate was measured with an In-Check Dial device. Dichotomous data were compared (RA versus control) using Fisher's exact test.
   Results: Thirty four participants were recruited for each group. For all inhalers, fewer participants with RA were able to complete all the steps necessary to operate the device: pMDI (50% vs. 91%), Easi-Breathe (R) (77% vs. 97%), HandiHaler (R) (15% vs. 94%) and Turbohaler (R) (85% vs. 100%). This difference was significant (p < .05) for the pMDI, Easi-Breathe (R) and HandiHaler (R). Significantly fewer people (p < .05) with RA were able to depress the pMDI canister, or to complete three steps in the operation of the Handihaler (R) (open the dust cap, remove the capsule from its blister, pierce the capsule). Only one participant (RA group) was unable to achieve the minimum flow rates required to operate the Turbohaler (R) and HandiHaler (R) (p=1.000).
   Conclusions: People with RA have varying physical abilities to use inhalers effectively. A person-centred approach is required to assess which inhaler device is appropriate for each individual patient.

AB Background: Autoantibodies against lung epithelial antigens are often detected in patients with Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF). Anti-Parietal Cell Antibodies (APCA) target the H+/K+ ATPase (proton pump). APCA prevalence and lung H+/K+ ATPase expression was never studied in IPF patients.
   Methods: We retrospectively collected clinical, lung function and imaging data from APCA positive patients (APCA+IPF) and compared them with APCA negative IPF patients matched on the date of diagnostic assessment. H+/K+ ATPase expression was assessed with immunohistochemistry and PCR.
   Results: Among 138 IPF patients diagnosed between 2007 and 2014 and tested for APCA, 19 (13.7%) APCA+ patients were identified. APCA+ IPF patients were 16 men and 3 women, mean age 71 years. The median titer of APCA was 1:160. A pernicious anemia was present in 5 patients and preceded the fibrosis in 3 cases. With a mean follow up of 31 months, 2 patients had an exacerbation and 7 patients died. As compared with 19 APCA-IPF patients, APCA+ IPF patients had a less severe disease with better DLCO (57% vs 43% predicted), preserved PaO2 (85 +/- 8 mmHg vs 74 +/- 11 mmHg), a lower rate of honeycombing on HRCT (58% vs 89%), but they experienced an accelerated decline of FVC (difference 61.4 ml/year; p = .0002). The H+/K+ ATPase was strongly expressed by hyperplastic alveolar epithelial cells in the fibrotic lung.
   Conclusion: Anti-parietal cell autoimmunity is detected in some IPF patients and is associated with an accelerated decline of lung function. Anti-parietal cell autoimmunity may promote lung fibrosis progression.

TI Peak circulatory power is a strong prognostic factor in patients with
   idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension

LA English
DT Article
DE Idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension; Cardiopulmonary exercise
   testing; Peak circulatory power
ID CHRONIC HEART-FAILURE; EXERCISE CAPACITY; BLOOD-PRESSURE; CARDIAC POWER;
   SURVIVAL; DISEASE; RISK
AB Background: Studies have shown that peak circulatory power (peak CircP; peak oxygen uptake x peak systolic blood pressure) is a variable predictor of prognosis in patients with left heart failure. It remains unknown whether peak CircP also predicts outcome in patients with idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension (IPAH).
   Methods: Patients with newly diagnosed IPAH who underwent symptom-limited cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) from 1 January 2011 to 1 January 2014 in Fuwai Hospital were prospectively enrolled and followed for up to 66 months for cardiac events (mortality and lung transplantation).
   Results: One hundred forty patients with IPAH (104 female, mean age: 33 +/- 11 years) were studied. During follow-up (mean: 42 +/- 14 months), 24 patients died and 1 patient underwent lung transplantation. In the univariate analysis, peak oxygen uptake(VO2), oxygen uptake at anaerobic threshold, ventilation (VE)/carbon dioxide output (VCO2) slope, end-tidal partial pressure of carbon dioxide at anaerobic threshold, peak systolic blood pressure (SBP), the change of SBP, the change of heart rate, peak work rate, peak CircP, pulmonary vascular resistance, cardiac index and World Health Organization functional class were predictive of cardiac events (all P < .05). In the multivariate analysis, Peak CircP in the fourth model had the highest significance compared with peak VO2 and VE/VCO2 slope in the second and third model (chi-square = 5.26, P < .02, HR: 0.99, 95% CI: 0.99 to 1.00).
   Conclusions: Peak CircP, better than peak VO2 and VE/VCO(2)slope, was a strong predictor of cardiac events among exercise parameters in patients with IPAH.

TI Association of exercise-induced wheeze and other asthma symptoms with
   emergency department visits and hospitalizations in a large cohort of

AB Objective: Exercise-induced wheeze (EIW) has been found to be associated with asthma-related urgent care in school-aged children. Despite asthma's high prevalence and morbidity among adolescents, this association has not been examined in adolescents. We tested the association of EIW and other asthma symptoms to asthma-related ED visits and hospitalizations in urban adolescents with probable asthma. We hypothesized that EIW would be associated with urgent care.
   Methods: In this cross-sectional study 30,467 high school students (mean age = 16.0) from 49 NYC schools completed two brief validated measures, one assessing probable asthma and the other the frequency of six asthma symptoms over the past year. Adolescents also reported if in the past year they had an asthma-related ED visit or hospitalization. Analyses presented here included students with probable asthma (n = 9149). Using logistic regression, we modeled each asthma symptom as a function of ED visits and hospitalizations adjusting for sex, age, race/ethnicity and asthma severity. Multivariable models included all symptoms to account for the potential interaction between symptoms.
   Results: Among adolescents with probable asthma, EIW was associated with ED visits and hospitalizations. In multivariable models wheeze without a cold, chest tightness, night wakening, but not EIW, were significantly associated with both ED visits and hospitalizations.
   Conclusions: Unlike findings with younger children, EIW does not appear to be associated with ED visits and hospitalizations among urban adolescents with probable asthma. Instead, symptoms, such as chest tightness and night wakening, appear to be important at identifying adolescents at risk for asthma-related urgent care.

   Fibrosis
ID OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY-DISEASE; AIR-TRAVEL; OXYGEN SUPPLEMENTATION;
   COMMERCIAL FLIGHT; HYPOXEMIA; ALTITUDE; EQUATIONS; EXPOSURE; FIBROSIS
AB Background: Pre-flight risk assessments are currently recommended for all Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD) patients. Hypoxic challenge testing (HCT) can inform regarding the need for supplemental in-flight oxygen but variables which might predict the outcome of HCT and thus guide referral for assessment, are unknown.
   Methods: A retrospective analysis of ILD patients attending for HCT at three tertiary care ILD referral centres was undertaken to investigate the concordance between HCT and existing predictive equations for prediction of inflight hypoxia. Physiological variables that might predict a hypoxaemic response to HCT were also explored with the aim of developing a practical pre-flight assessment algorithm for ILD patients.
   Results: A total of 106 ILD patients (69 of whom (65%) had Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF)) underwent HCT. Of these, 54 (51%) patients (of whom 37 (69%) had IPF) failed HCT and were recommended supplemental in-flight oxygen. Existing predictive equations were unable to accurately predict the outcome of HCT. ILD patients who failed HCT had significantly lower resting SpO(2), baseline PaO2, reduced walking distance, FEV1, FVC and TLCO, but higher GAP index than those who passed HCT.
   Conclusions: TLCO > 50% predicted and PaO2 > 9.42 kPa were independent predictors for passing HCT. Using these discriminators, a novel, practical pre-flight algorithm for evaluation of ILD patients is proposed.

AB Background: The assessment of the clinical symptoms is the weakest link of the pulmonary embolism (PE) diagnostic algorithm. Despite the presence of highly sensitive and specific imaging methods, verifying PE remains difficult due to nonspecific clinical symptoms and frequently its subclinical course.
   Objective: The aim of this study is to improve the recognition of PE by investigating the clinical presentation and short-term prognosis of unprovoked PE in comparison to provoked PE. The study was directed to patients who suffer from PE as a primary disease.
   Methods: This prospective observational study included 331 patients with PE, approved by computer tomographic pulmoangiography. They were categorized as having unprovoked or provoked PE, according to their epidemiological data. The clinical characteristics and one-month mortality rate were compared between both groups.
   Results: About 67% of the patients had provoking factors and similar to 33% had unprovoked PE. The patients in the unprovoked PE-group were younger compared to provoked PE-group (56.67 +/- 17.95 vs 63.76 +/- 14.58, p < .0001) and the males predominated vs females (62.04% vs 37.96%, p = .012). The patients with unprovoked PE had more previous thromboembolic events compared to provoked PE-group (30.56% vs 19.45%, p = .022) and a larger thrombotic burden (p = .001). Dyspnea (85.18% vs 85.13%), chest pain (47.22% vs 46.85%), cough (43.92% vs 45.94%), hemoptysis (16.67% vs 14.41%), hemodynamic instability (9.26% vs 8.56%), deep venous thrombosis (49.51% vs 44.5%) had similar frequencies in both groups. No significant differences in the means of systolic pressure of arteria pulmonalis, D-dimer, arterial blood gases, Revised Geneva probability score were found. One-month mortality was lower in unprovoked PE-group than in provoked (1.85% vs 8.52%, p = .042).
   Conclusions: Unprovoked PE occurs at a younger age, more frequently in males. It is characterized by the following significant variables: higher Wells score, lower PESI score, lower CRP, higher thrombotic burden and lower one-month mortality rate, compared to provoked PE.

AB Aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease is a chronic and treatment-resistant disease, characterized by the presence of eosinophilic rhinosinusitis, nasal polyposis, bronchial asthma, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs hypersensitivity. Alterations in arachidonic acid metabolism may induce an imbalance between pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory substances, expressed as an overproduction of cysteinyl leukotrienes and an underproduction of prostaglandin E2. Although eosinophils play a key role, recent studies have shown the importance of other cells and molecules in the development of the disease like mast cells, basophils, lymphocytes, platelets, neutrophils, macrophages, epithelial respiratory cells, IL-33 and thymic stromal lymphopoietin, making each of them promissory diagnostic and treatment targets.
   In this review, we summarize the most important clinical aspects of the disease, including the current topics about diagnosis and treatment, like provocation challenges and aspirin desensitization. We also discuss recent findings in the pathogenesis of the disease, as well as future trends in diagnosis and treatment, including monoclonal antibodies and a low salicylate diet as a treatment option.

AB Background: Executive dysfunction (ED) is often observed in subjects diagnosed with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), but their assessment requires facilities that are not always available. We aim to evaluate the extent to which Frontal Assessment Battery (FAB) discriminates ED in newly diagnosed, untreated, and without-comorbidity OSA patients.
   Methods: Sixty subjects participated in the study. Of these, 40 (31 males and 9 females) were newly diagnosed for OSA through full-night polysomnography (apnea/hypopnea index; M = 39.01, SD = 27.16), untreated, with a mean age of 54.50 years (SD = 8.90), while the remaining 20 (15 males and 5 females) had no symptoms of OSA (M = 51.60 years, SD = 10.70). The instruments used were the following: Questionnaire for Sleep Apnea Risk, Epworth Sleepiness Scale, Mini-Mental State Examination, and FAB.
   Results: The group with OSA exhibited significantly lower values in the FAB global score (p = 0.003) and in Conceptualization (p = 0.001) and Mental Flexibility (p = 0.009) subtests. ROC analysis showed adequate discriminative capacity for the FAB global score (AUC = 0.74) and for Conceptualization (AUC = 0.75) and Mental Flexibility (AUC = 0.70) scores.
   Conclusions: The FAB is a short and no-time-consuming tool that can be used to investigate the presence of ED in untreated OSA patients with no comorbidities, providing clinicians with a simple and effective way of detecting the presence of this dysfunction and allowing a more informed decision for the need of a full neuropsychological assessment.

AB Introduction: There have been four randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded studies of intravenous (IV) iron in Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS), all of which delivered a final total dose of 1000 mg of iron. The purpose of this study was to evaluate effects of a lesser total dose (500 mg of iron).
   Methods: Subjects with idiopathic RLS were enrolled in a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled study. Subjects received either 500 mg ferric carboxymaltose (FCM) or placebo as a single infusion (Phase I). Subjects who were previously on medication were off any RLS medications for at least two weeks prior to baseline assessment. The primary outcome variable was a change-from-baseline at week six on the International RLS Severity Scale (IRLSS) and a subject-completed Visual Analog Scale of Severity (VAS). Phase II of the study involved long-term (30 weeks) follow-up after completing the six week efficacy phase.
   Results: At week six post infusion, FCM, compared to placebo recipients, showed no significantly greater change-from-baseline for both primary outcome measures (IRLSS scale, FCM 500 mg vs. placebo: -8.3 +/- 7.5 vs. -4.8 +/- 8.7, p = 0.100; VAS, FCM 500 mg vs. placebo: -23.4 +/- 24.1 vs. -13.3 +/- 23.1, p = 0.077). None of the secondary outcome variables showed a significant difference at week six. Seven (21.9%) of the 32 subjects treated with iron in Phase I remained free from further RLS medications at 30 weeks. No serious adverse effects were found in this study.
   Conclusions: This study did not show significant benefit from a single 500 mg FCM treatment for RLS symptoms. The two previous, well-controlled, trials of 1000 mg FCM showed significant treatment benefits which suggested that there may have been a clinically relevant total dose required to achieve a clinical response.

AB Background: The development of malignant ventricular arrhythmias due to abnormal cardiac repolarization is a major complication after coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG). Sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) is linked to prolonged cardiac repolarization in non-surgical patients. This study evaluates cardiac repolarization in patients with and without SDB who underwent CABG.
   Methods: 100 patients who had received CABG (84% men, age 68 +/- 10 years, body-mass-index [BMI] 28.7 +/- 4.2 kg/m(2)) were retrospectively evaluated. Polygraphy was recorded the night before CABG. SDB was defined as an apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) of >= 15/h and differentiated into central (CSA) and obstructive (OSA) sleep apnea. Cardiac repolarizationwas assessed by means of T-peak-to-end (TpTe) and QTc-intervals and TpTe/QT-ratios derived from 12-lead electrocardiography (ECG).
   Results: 37% of patients had SDB, 14% CSA and 23% OSA. Before CABG, patients with CSA and OSA had longer TpTe intervals than those without SDB (TpTe: CSA 100 +/- 26 vs. OSA 97 +/- 19 vs. no SDB 85 +/- 14 ms, p = 0.013). QTc intervals and TpTe/QT ratios differed between the two groups (QTc: 444 +/- 54 vs. 462 +/- 36 vs. 421 +/- 32 ms, p < 0.001; TpTe/QT ratio: 0.24 +/- 0.04 vs. 0.23 +/- 0.05 vs. 0.21 +/- 0.03, p = 0.045). SDB was associated with abnormal cardiac repolarization independent of known risk factors for cardiac arrhythmias, such as age, sex, BMI, N-terminal-pro-brain-natriuretic-peptide (NT-proBNP), and heart failure (TpTe: B-coefficient [95%-CI]: 16.0, [7.6-24.3], p < 0.001; QTc: 27.2 [9.3-45.1], p = 0.003; TpTe/QT ratio: 2.9 [1.2-4.6], p < 0.001).
   Conclusion: Independent of known risk factors for cardiac arrhythmias, SDB was significantly associated with abnormal cardiac repolarization before CABG. Data suggest that SDB may contribute to an increased risk of ventricular arrhythmias after CABG. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The loss of vision, particularly when it occurs early in life, is associated with compensatory cortical plasticity not only in the visual cortical areas, but throughout the entire brain. The absence of visual input to the retina can also induce changes in entrainment of the circadian rhythm, as light is the primary zeitgeber of the master biological clock found in the suprachiasmatic nucleus of the hypothalamus. In addition, a greater number of sleep disturbances is often reported in blind individuals. Here, we examined various electroencephalographic microstructural components of sleep, both during rapid-eye-movement (REM) sleep and non-REM (NREM) sleep, between blind individuals, including both of early and late onset, and normal-sighted controls. During wakefulness, occipital alpha oscillations were lower, or absent in blind individuals. During sleep, differences were observed across electrode derivations between the early and late blind samples, which may reflect altered cortical networking in early blindness. Despite these differences in power spectra density, the electroencephalography microstructure of sleep, including sleep spindles, slow wave activity, and sawtooth waves, remained present in the absence of vision.

AB Background: Sleep Disturbances (SDs) are a symptom common to mental health disorders (MHD) and substance use disorders (SUD). We aimed to identify the value of SD as a predictor for subsequent treatment of illicit drug and alcohol use disorders (SUDs) in primary care and relative to the predictive value of mental health disorders (MHDs).
   Methods: We used electronic health records data from ambulatory primary care in a safety net Boston area healthcare system from 2013 to 2015 (n = 83,920). SUD (separated into illicit drug use disorder and alcohol use disorder) and MHD were identified through ICD-9 codes and medical record documentation. We estimated Cox proportional hazard models to examine the risk of SUD across four comparison groups (SD only, SD and MHD, MHD only, and neither SD nor MHD).
   Results: Compared to patients with no sleep or MHD, patients with SD had a greater risk for subsequent SUD treatment. Approximately one-fifth of patients with SD were treated for an illicit drug use disorder and approximately 12% were treated for alcohol use disorder. Risk for SUD treatment, estimated at over 30% by the end of the study, was greatest for patients with a MHD, either alone or comorbid with SD. Risk was greater for older patients and men, and lower for minority patients.
   Conclusions: SD and MHD, individually and comorbid, significantly predict subsequent treatment of illicit drug and alcohol use disorder in primary care. Screening and evaluation for SD should be a routine practice in primary care to help with identifying potential SUD risk. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Objective: A systematic review and meta-analysis of the association between alcohol consumption and risk of sleep apnoea in adults.
   Methods: We searched Medline, EMBASE and Web of Science databases from 1985 to 2015 for comparative epidemiological studies assessing the relation between alcohol consumption and sleep apnoea. Two authors independently screened and extracted data. Random effects meta-analysis was used to estimate pooled effect sizes with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Heterogeneity was quantified using I-2 and explored using subgroup analyses based on study exposure and outcome measures, quality, design, adjustment for confounders and geographical location. Publication bias was assessed using a funnel plot and Egger's test.
   Results: We identified 21 studies from which estimates of relative risk could be obtained. Meta-analysis of these estimates demonstrated that higher levels of alcohol consumption increased the risk of sleep apnoea by 25% (RR 1.25, 95% CI 1.13-1.38, I-2 = 82%, p < 0.0001). This estimate's differences were robust in alcohol consumption and sleep apnoea definitions, study design, and quality but was greater in Low and Middle Income Country locations. We detected evidence of publication bias (p = 0.001). A further eight included studies reported average alcohol consumption in people with and without sleep apnoea. Meta-analysis revealed that mean alcohol intake was two units/week higher in those with sleep apnoea, but this difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.41).
   Conclusion: These findings suggest that alcohol consumption is associated with a higher risk of sleep apnoea, further supporting evidence that reducing alcohol intake is of potential therapeutic and preventive value in this condition. (C) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Background: Most previous studies on sleep duration and cardio-cerebral vascular disease (CCVD) association have not adequately controlled for many confounders. The current study prospectively examined the association of sleep duration with CCVD prevalence in a Chinese community population; cardiovascular risk factors, chronic diseases, and sleep quality were taken into consideration.
   Methods: A cross-sectional study conducted in Pudong New Area of Shanghai, China. Through three-stage sampling, 10,657 adults aged >= 15 years were randomly selected. Self-reported sleep duration and CCVD prevalence were obtained using a structured questionnaire. Medical records of the subjects were reviewed by investigators for further confirmation. Relationships between sleep duration and CCVD prevalence were examined using logistic regression models.
   Results: Compared to midrange sleep duration (7 h), the multivariate-adjusted OR of CCVD prevalence was 1.550 (95% CI 1.192-2.017) for sleeping 5 h, 1.427 (95% CI 0.983-2.072) for sleeping <5 h. A similar situation also prevailed in coronary heart disease (CHD) prevalence: the multivariate-adjusted OR of stroke prevalence was 2.130 (95% CI 1.338-3.389) for sleeping >9 h. In an analysis stratified by sex, participants with a long sleep duration (>9 h) demonstrated significantly increased prevalence (OR = 3.623, 95% CI 1.862-7.052) for stroke only in men.
   Conclusions: The relationship between extreme sleep durations and CCVD were influenced by sex in a Chinese community population. Further studies are needed to investigate the mechanisms of the association between extreme sleep duration and CCVD, as well as sex-specificity in the relationship. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB Objective: This study is aimed at evaluating whether Continuous Positive Airway Pressure treatment (CPAP) may affect autonomic nervous system (ANS) in male patients with severe obstructive sleep apnea (OSAS).
   Methods: We compared autonomic symptoms of de novo severe OSAS patients, OSAS patients on chronic CPAP treatment and healthy controls, using the Scales for Outcome in Parkinson disease-Autonomic (SCOPA-AUT) questionnaire. All groups underwent cardiovascular function tests including head-up tilt test (HUTT), Valsalva maneuver, deep breathing, hand grip and cold face tests. Statistical significance was set at p < 0.05.
   Results: Twelve de novo severe OSAS patients, 17 male OSAS on CPAP and 14 controls were studied. The mean SCOPA-AUT total score was significantly higher in de novo OSAS patients compared with controls. Regarding the distinct domains, both de novo OSAS and CPAP group had abnormalities in respect of controls in urinary sphere. In supine rest condition the baseline values of systolic blood pressure were significantly increased in untreated OSAS patients compared with controls, whereas the basal values of diastolic blood pressure were significantly higher in CPAP patients with respect to controls. After ten min of HUTT, diastolic blood pressure changes were significantly higher in controls compared to both OSAS groups. Untreated OSAS patients showed significant different responses at deep breathing compared to controls. Both OSAS groups had a significant reduction of reflex bradycardia at cold face test.
   Conclusions: Our study shows that both treated and untreated OSAS patients complain of subjective autonomic symptoms like other sleep disorders reinforcing the close relationship between sleep and autonomic activity. Furthermore, cardiovascular reflexes indicate a tendency to hypertension and a reduced sensitivity to stimuli during wakefulness even in OSA patients on CPAP treatment, suggesting potentially permanent autonomic function deficits.

AB Objective/Background: Massive changes in brain morphology and function in the first years of life reveal a postero-anterior trajectory of cortical maturation accompanied by regional modifications of NREM sleep. One of the most sensible marker of this maturation process is represented by electroencephalographic (EEG) activity within the frequency range of sleep spindles. However, direct evidence that these changes actually reflect maturational modifications of fast and slow spindles still lacks.
   Our study aimed at answering the following questions:
   1. Do cortical changes at 11.50 Hz frequency correspond to slow spindles?
   2. Do fast and slow spindles show different age trajectories and different topographical distributions?
   3. Do changes in peak frequency explain age changes of slow and fast spindles?
   Patients/Methods: We measured the antero-posterior changes of slow and fast spindles in the first 60 min of nightly sleep of 39 infants and children (0-48 mo.).
   Results: We found that (A) changes of slow spindles from birth to childhood mostly affect frontal areas (B) variations of fast and slow spindles across age groups go in opposite direction, the latter progressively increasing across ages; (C) this process is not merely reducible to changes of spindle frequency.
   Conclusions: As a main finding, our cross-sectional study shows that the first form of mature spindle (i.e., corresponding to the adult phasic event of NREM sleep) is marked by the emergence of slow spindles on anterior regions around the age of 12 months.

AB Background: Idiopathic REM sleep behaviour disorder (iRBD) has been recognised as a significant biomarker for developing a neurodegenerative alpha-synucleinopathy, which is why iRBD is considered to be a prodromal state for alpha-synucleinopathies including Parkinson's disease (PD). Many patients with PD suffer from complaints of pain and present impaired somatosensory function. We hypothesized that pain perception and somatosensory function could be altered already in a preclinical stage of PD including iRBD. Hence, the objective of this study was to investigate pain perception and somatosensory function in patients with iRBD.
   Methods: Quantitative sensory testing (QST), laser evoked potentials (LEPs), and conditioned pain modulation (CPM) testing were performed in 13 iRBD patients without any clinical signs of PD or narcolepsy (11 males, 2 females, mean age 65.2 years) and 15 gender-and age-matched healthy control subjects (12 males, 3 females, mean age 65.8 years).
   Results: Thermal detection thresholds were higher in the iRBD group compared with the control group (cold detection threshold (CDT) p = 0.020, thermal sensory limen (TSL) p = 0.001), indicating an impaired temperature sensation in iRBD patients. The N2/P2 LEPs amplitude was smaller in iRBD patients than controls, but not statistically significant (p = 0.053).
   Conclusions: This study found an impaired somatosensory function in iRBD patients, suggesting that somatosensory impairment might be an early feature in the neurodegenerative process of PD. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Sleep assessment is a fundamental part of health evaluation. In fact, many diseases (such as obesity, diabetes, or hypertension, as well as psychiatric, neurological, and cardiovascular diseases) produce sleep disorders that are often used as indicators, diagnosis (symptoms), or even as predictors (eg, for depression) of health. For this reason, many efforts have been devoted to designing methods to control and report on sleep quality. Two of the most used sleep assessment tools are sleep questionnaires and sleep diaries. Both methods have a very low cost are easy to administer do not require a sleep centre (unlike, eg, polysomnography), and can be self-administered. Most important, as it has been shown in recent studies, their accuracy is relatively high. In this survey, we systematically review and compare these tools. We examine the evolution of sleep questionnaires and diaries over time, and compare their structure and usage. We also review the validation studies and comparatives performed in previous studies. This allows us to compare the relative sensitivities and specificities of these methods. Modern sleep diaries come in the form of an app. Therefore, we also present the most advanced and used apps, and discuss their advantages over classical paper diaries. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB Objectives: Spinocerebellar ataxias are progressive neurodegenerative disorders characterized by progressive cerebellar features with additional neuro-axis involvement. Oculomotor abnormality is one of the most frequent manifestations. This study was done to assess the polysomnographic abnormalities in patients with Spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA1, SCA2 and SCA3) and also to evaluate whether oculomotor abnormalities interfere with sleep stage R scoring.
   Methods: The study was carried out using 36 genetically positive SCA patients. All patients underwent neurological examination with special focus on oculomotor function (optokinetic nystagmus-OKN and extraocular movement restriction-EOM). The sleep quality was measured with Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS). Disease severity was assessed with International Cooperative Ataxia Rating Scale (ICARS). All the patients underwent over-night video-polysomnography (VPSG).
   Results: Out of 36 patients studied, the data of 34 patients [SCA1 (n = 12), SCA2 (n = 13), SCA3 (n = 9)] were used for final analysis. Patients from SCA1, SCA2, and SCA3 category did not show significant differences in age and diseases severity (ICARS). All patients had vertical OKN impairment. Oculomotor impairment was higher in SCA2 patients. Sleep macro-architecture analysis showed absent stage R sleep, predominantly in SCA2 (69%) followed by SCA3 (44%) and SCA1 (8%). Patients showed a strong negative correlation of stage R sleep percentage with disease severity and oculomotor dysfunction.
   Conclusion: Voluntary saccadic eye movement velocity and rapid eye movements (REMs) in sleep are strongly correlated. The more severe the saccadic velocity impairment, the less likely was it to generate REMs (rapid eye movements) during stage R. Accordingly 69% of SCA2 patients with severe occulomotor impairments showed absent stage R as per the AASM sleep scoring. We presume that the impaired REMs generation in sleep could be due to oculomotor abnormality and has resulted in spuriously low or absent stage R sleep percentage in SCA patients with conventional VPSG scoring rules. The present study recommends the modification of AASM scoring rules for stage R in patients with oculomotor abnormalities. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The study is based on a complex and unique data set of water stable isotopes (i.e., delta O-18 and delta H-2), radon-222 activities (i.e., Rn-222) and groundwater levels to better understand the interaction of fresh groundwater and recirculated seawater in a snowmelt-affected subterranean estuary (STE) in a boreal region (lies de-la-Madeleine, Qc, Canada). By using a combination of hydrogeological and marine geochemical approaches, the objective was to analyze and quantify submarine groundwater discharge processes through a boreal beach after the snow melt period, in early June. The distribution of delta O-18 and delta H-2 in beach groundwater showed that inland fresh groundwater contributed between 97 and 30% of water masses presented within the STE. A time series of water table levels during the 16 days of the study indicated that tides propagated as a dynamic wave limiting the mass displacement of seawater within the STE. This up-and-down movement of the water table (similar to 10-30 cm) induced the vertical infiltration of seawater at the falling tide. At the front of the beach, a radon-based mass balance calculated with high resolution Rn-222 survey estimated total SGD of 3.1 m(3)/m/d at the discharge zone and a mean flow to 1.5 m(3)/m/d in the bay. The nearshore discharge agreed relatively well with Darcy fluxes calculated at the beach face. Fresh groundwater makes up more than 50% of the total discharge during the measuring campaign. These results indicate that beaches in boreal and cold regions could be important sources of freshwater originate and groundwater-borne solutes and contaminants to the marine environment after the snowmelt.

AB Estimating the time required for water to travel through headwater catchments from where it recharges to where it discharges into streams (the transit time) is important for understanding catchment behaviour. This study uses tritium (H-3) activities of stream water to estimate the mean transit times of water in the upper Latrobe and Yarra catchments, southeast Australia, at different flow conditions. The H-3 activities of the stream water were between 1.26 and 1.99 TU, which are lower than those of local rainfall (2.6 to 3.0 TU). H-3 activities in individual subcatchments are almost invariably lowest at low streamflows. Mean transit times calculated from the H-3 activities using a range of lumped parameter models are between 7 and 62 years and are longest during low streamflows. Uncertainties in the estimated mean transit times result from uncertainties in the geometry of the flow systems, uncertainties in the H-3 input, and macroscopic mixing. In addition, simulation of H-3 activities in FEFLOW indicates that heterogeneous hydraulic conductivities increase the range of mean transit times corresponding to a specific H-3 activity. The absolute uncertainties in the mean transit times may be up to +/- 30 years. However, differences between mean transit times at different streamflows in the same catchment or between different sub catchments in the same area are more reliably estimated. Despite the uncertainties, the conclusions that the mean transit times are years to decades and decrease with increasing streamflow are robust. The seasonal variation in major ion geochemistry and H-3 activities indicate that the higher general streamflows in winter are sustained by water displaced from shallower younger stores (e.g., soils or regolith). Poor correlations between H-3 activities and catchment area, drainage density, mean slope, distance to stream, and landuse, imply that mean transit times are controlled by a variety of factors including the hydraulic properties of the soils and aquifers that are difficult to characterise spatially. The long mean transit times imply that there are long-lived stores of water in these catchments that may sustain streamflow over drought periods. Additionally, there may be considerable delay in contaminants reaching the stream. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The groundwater of the Cabo de Gata detritic aquifer, in southeastern Spain, exhibit salinities of between 70-726 mmol/L of Cl- (brackish-salt to hypersaline waters). We have investigated the causes of the high salinity anomaly, which at certain points exceeds that of present-day seawater (600 mmol/L). Two hypotheses are considered as possible sources for the saline water: (1) The deeper, more saline groundwater date back to an old marine intrusion that occurred at the end of the last Ice Age (14-17 ka), when seawater salinity was higher than in the present day. This hypothesis is supported by the values of C-14 measured in this water (similar to 6-10 pmc), which indicate old water of up to 17 ka. However, the values of O-18 and H-2 are lower than would be expected. (2) The water is the result of mixing between fresh groundwater and seawater. The latter explanation agrees well with the low values of O-18 and H-2. This mixture is later subject to evaporation, explaining its high salinity. Hydrogeochemical modelling was carried out for the most saline samples, assuming such mixing between freshwater and seawater followed by evaporation, and the results show a very good agreement between the measured and simulated values. According to the model calculation, the original mixture contained approximately 60% seawater and its volume subsequently was reduced through evaporation by around 30%. This mixing and evaporation could occur during the Flandrian Transgression (6000-8000 y), when this area accommodated a coastal lagoon. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The accurate analysis of the contaminant transport process in wetland flows is essential for environmental assessment. However, dispersivity assessment becomes complicated when the wind strength and direction are taken into consideration. Prior studies illustrating the wind effect on environmental dispersion in wetland flows simply focused on the mean longitudinal concentration distribution. Moreover, the results obtained by these analyses are not accurate when done on a smaller scale, namely, the initial stage of the contaminant transport process. By combining the concentration moments method (the Aris' method) and Gill's expansion theory, the previous researches on environmental dispersion in wetland flows with effect of wind have been extended. By adopting up to 4th-order moments, the wind effect-as illustrated by dimensionless parameters Er (wind force) and omega (wind direction)-on kurtosis and skewness is discussed, the up to 4th-order vertical concentration distribution is obtained, and the two-dimensional concentration distribution is illustrated. This work demonstrates that wind intensity and direction can significantly affect the contaminant dispersion. Moreover, the study presents a more accurate analytical solution of environmental dispersion in wetland flows under various wind conditions. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Prewhitening, the process of eliminating or reducing short-term stochastic persistence to enable detection of deterministic change, has been extensively applied to time series analysis of a range of geophysical variables. Despite the controversy around its utility, methodologies for prewhitening time series continue to be a critical feature of a variety of analyses including: trend detection of hydroclimatic variables and reconstruction of climate and/or hydrology through proxy records such as tree rings. With a focus on the latter, this paper presents a generalized approach to exploring the impact of a wide range of stochastic structures of short- and long-term persistence on the variability of hydroclimatic time series. Through this approach, we examine the impact of prewhitening on the inferred variability of time series across time scales. We document how a focus on prewhitened, residual time series can be misleading, as it can drastically distort (or remove) the structure of variability across time scales. Through examples with actual data, we show how such loss of information in prewhitened time series of tree rings (so-called "residual chronologies") can lead to the underestimation of extreme conditions in climate and hydrology, particularly droughts, reconstructed for centuries preceding the historical period.

AB For most of aquifers with abundant groundwater resource, quantifications of tortuosity and corresponding representative elementary volume (REV) are very essential to improve the understanding of groundwater and contaminant transfers in porous media. In this study, a mathematical model of tortuosity based on the three dimensional (3D) microstructure of regular tetrahedron (RTM) is proposed to quantify tortuosity and corresponding REV of granular porous media. The calculated tortuosity using the new 3D RTM model agrees well with the measured tortuosity in experiment, indicating that the new 3D microstructure model is more appropriate to precisely delineate the tortuosity of granular porous media. Afterward, the new model is utilized to quantify the tortuosity of heterogeneous translucent silica. Moreover, corresponding REV is estimated using a criterion of relative gradient error (epsilon(i)(g)). Results suggest minimum tau-REV sizes most distribute in 0.0-5.0 mm and the bound of cumulative frequency above 80% is larger than 3.00 mm. The REV scale of tortuosity has its own rationality and superiority over that estimated by two-dimensional (2D) tortuosity model, implying the proposed 3D tortuosity model of RTM is helpful for understanding the tortuosity of flow paths in granular porous media and corresponding REV estimation of tortuosity.

ID STORMWATER MANAGEMENT; HARVESTING SYSTEM; WATER; QUALITY; EXAMPLE
AB Communities living on atolls and similar low-lying islands in the tropical Pacific rely on rainwater and shallow groundwater to meet domestic water needs. Rainwater, generally captured and stored using rooftop rainwater catchment systems, is the preferred water source due to higher quality and convenience of access. This study assesses the performance of rainwater catchment systems (RWCS) on Ifalik Atoll, located in Yap State, Federated States of Micronesia in the western Pacific. A field survey was conducted in August 2015 to evaluate RWCS features (guttered roof area, storage tank size, gutter leakage conditions), determine numbers of users, and estimate daily water use via household surveys. All 152 RWCS were surveyed. Water balance modeling was applied to the RWCS to estimate end-of-day stored rainwater volumes for each day of the 1997-1999 time period, during which an El Nino-induced drought occurred. Results indicate that the community is resilient to drought, although the majority of RWCS were depleted of rainwater and hence community sharing was required. Scenario testing indicates that increasing guttered roof area is the optimal strategy for enhancing system reliability. For example, the volume of water maintained at the peak of a drought can be tripled if the available roof areas for the RWCS are guttered. Design curves, which provide a set of roof area - tank volume combinations that achieve specified levels of reliability, were created and can be used to plan new RWCS. Besides offering insights into community-wide water storage and usage patterns and resiliency for Ifalik Atoll, this study presents methods that can be applied to other atoll island communities throughout the Indo-Pacific region.

AB In this study, a new stochastic model based on Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR) and multi-objective optimization methods is developed for optimal placement of sensors in water distribution system (WDS). This model determines minimization of risk which is caused by simultaneous multi-point contamination injection in WDS using CVaR approach. The CVaR considers uncertainties of contamination injection in the form of probability distribution function and calculates low-probability extreme events. In this approach, extreme losses occur at tail of the losses distribution function. Four-objective optimization model based on NSGA-II algorithm is developed to minimize losses of contamination injection (through CVaR of affected population and detection time) and also minimize the two other main criteria of optimal placement of sensors including probability of undetected events and cost. Finally, to determine the best solution, Preference Ranking Organization METHod for Enrichment Evaluation (PROMETHEE), as a subgroup of Multi Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) approach, is utilized to rank the alternatives on the trade-off curve among objective functions. Also, sensitivity analysis is done to investigate the importance of each criterion on PROMETHEE results considering three relative weighting scenarios. The effectiveness of the proposed methodology is examined through applying it to Lamerd WDS in the southwestern part of Iran. The PROMETHEE suggests 6 sensors with suitable distribution that approximately cover all regions of WDS. Optimal values related to CVaR of affected population and detection time as well as probability of undetected events for the best optimal solution are equal to 17,055 persons, 31 mins and 0.045%, respectively. The obtained results of the proposed methodology in Lamerd WDS show applicability of CVaR-based multi-objective simulation-optimization model for incorporating the main uncertainties of contamination injection in order to evaluate extreme value of losses in WDS.

AB Recent research has found that hydrologic modeling over decadal time periods often requires time variant model parameters. Most prior work has focused on assessing time variance in model parameters conceptualizing watershed features and functions. In this paper, we assess whether adding a time variant scalar to potential evapotranspiration (PET) can be used in place of time variant parameters. Using the HBV hydrologic model and four different simple but common PET methods (Hamon, Priestly-Taylor, Oudin, and Hargreaves), we simulated 60+ years of daily discharge on four rivers in New York state. Allowing all ten model parameters to vary in time achieved good model fits in terms of daily NSE and long-term water balance. However, allowing single model parameters to vary in time - including a scalar on PET - achieved nearly equivalent model fits across PET methods. Overall, varying a PET scalar in time is likely more physically consistent with known biophysical controls on PET as compared to varying parameters conceptualizing innate watershed properties related to soil properties such as wilting point and field capacity. This work suggests that the seeming need for time variance in innate watershed parameters may be due to overly simple evapotranspiration formulations that do not account for all factors controlling evapotranspiration over long time periods.

AB Depth-specific sampling of groundwater is important for a variety of hydrogeological applications. Several sampling methods are available but comparably little is known about how their results compare. Therefore, samples from regular observation wells (short screen), micro-filters and direct push were,compared for two sites with differing hydrogeological conditions and land use, both located in the Fuhrberger Feld, Germany. The encountered hydrochemical zonation requires a high resolution of 1 m or better, which the available small number of regular observation wells could only roughly mirror. Because the three methods employ significantly varying pumping rates and therefore, have varying spatial origins of the sample, individual concentrations at similar depths may differ significantly. In a hydrologically and chemically dynamical environment such as the agricultural site, this effect becomes more pronounced than for the more stable forest site. The micro-filters are probably the most depth-specific, but showed distinctly lower concentrations for dissolved gases than the other two methods, due to degassing during sampling. They should thus not be used for any method that relies on dissolved gas analysis. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The Xikuangshan(XKS) mine, the world's largest antimony mine, was chosen for a detailed arsenic hydro-geochemical study because of the elevated arsenic in bedrock aquifers used by local residents. Hydrochemical data, delta S-34 values of dissolved SO42- and Sr-87/Sr-86 ratios have been analyzed to identify the predominant geochemical processes that control the arsenic mobilization within the aquifers. Groundwater samples can be divided into three major types: low arsenic groundwater (0-50 mu g/L), high arsenic groundwater (50-1000 mu g/L) and anomalous high arsenic groundwater (>1000 mu g/L). Arsenic occurs under oxidizing conditions at the XKS Sb mine as the HAsO42- anion. The Ca/Na ratio correlates significantly with HCO3-/Na and Sr/Na ratios, indicating that carbonate dissolution and silicate weathering are the dominant processes controlling groundwater hydrochemistry. The delta S-34 values of the groundwater indicate that dissolved SO42- in groundwater is mainly sourced from the oxidation of sulfide minerals, and elevated As concentrations in groundwater are influenced by the mixing of mine water and surface water. Furthermore, the delta S-34 values are not correlated with dissolved As concentrations and Fe concentrations, suggesting that the reduction dissolution of Fe(III) hydroxides is not the dominant process controlling As mobilization. The Sr-87/Sr-86 ratios imply that elevated As concentrations in groundwater are primarily derived from the interaction with the stibnite and silicified limestone. More specifically, the excess-Na ion, the feature of Ca/Na ratio, and the spatial association of elevated As concentrations in groundwater collectively suggest that high and anomalous high arsenic groundwater are associated with smelting slags and, in particular, the arsenic alkali residue. In general, the hydrochemistry analysis, especially the S and Sr isotope evidences elucidate that elevated As concentrations and As mobilization are influenced by several geochemical processes, including: (1) bedrock weathering; (2) oxidation of arsenopyrite and the dominant sulfides in the ores; (3) mixing of mine drainage and surface Water; (4) leaching of the arsenic alkali residue; and (5) sorption-desorption from Fe/Mn oxides/hydroxides.

AB Groundwater discharge in coastal karst aquifers worldwide represents a substantial part of the water budget and is a main pathway for nutrient transport to the sea. Groundwater discharge to the sea manifests under different forths, making its assessment very challenging particularly in highly heterogeneous coastal systems karst systems. In this study, we present a methodology approach to identify and quantify four forms of groundwater discharge in a mixed lithology system in southern Spain (Maro-Cerro Gordo) that includes an ecologically protected coastal area comprised of karstic marble. We found that groundwater discharge to the sea occurs via: (1) groundwater-fed creeks, (2) coastal springs, (3) diffuse groundwater seepage through seabed sediments, and (4) submarine springs. We used a multi-method approach combining tracer techniques (salinity, Ra-224, and Rn-222) and direct measurements (seepage meters and flowmeters) to evaluate the discharge. Groundwater discharge via submarine springs was the most difficult to assess due to their depth (up to 15 m) and extensive development of the springs conduits. We determined that the total groundwater discharge over the 16 km of shoreline of the study area was at least 11 +/- 3 x 10(3) m(3) d(-1) for the four types of discharge assessed. Groundwater-derived nitrate (NO3-) fluxes to coastal waters over similar to 3 km (or 20%) in a highly populated and farmed section of Maro-Cerro Gordo was 641 +/- 166 mol d(-1), or similar to 75% of the total NO3- loading in the study area. We demonstrate in this study that a multi-method approach must be applied to assess all forms of SGD and derived nutrient fluxes to the sea in highly heterogeneous karst aquifer systems.

AB Rainfall infiltration on hillslopes is an important issue in hydrology, which is related to many environmental problems, such as flood, soil erosion, and nutrient and contaminant transport. This study aimed to improve the quantification of infiltration on hillslopes under both steady and unsteady rainfalls. Starting from Darcy's law, an analytical integral infiltrability equation was derived for hillslope infiltration by use of the flux-concentration relation. Based on this equation, a simple scaling relation linking the infiltration times on hillslopes and horizontal planes was obtained which is applicable for both small and large times and can be used to simplify the solution procedure of hillslope infiltration. The infiltrability equation also improved the estimation of ponding time for infiltration under rainfall conditions. For infiltration after ponding, the time compression approximation (TCA) was applied together with the infiltrability equation. To improve the computational efficiency, the analytical integral infiltrability equation was approximated with a two-term power-like function by nonlinear regression. Procedures of applying this approach to both steady and unsteady rainfall conditions were proposed. To evaluate the performance of the new approach, it was compared with the Green-Ampt model for sloping surfaces by Chen and Young (2006) and Richards' equation. The proposed model outperformed the sloping GreenAmpt, and both ponding time and infiltration predictions agreed well with the solutions of Richards' equation for various soil textures, slope angles, initial water contents, and rainfall intensities for both steady and unsteady rainfalls.

AB Trends in flow discharge, temperature and rainfall from the Qom Rood Watershed, Iran, for a period of 1979-2016 were analyzed at monthly and annual time scales. Trend analyses were conducted using the Mann-Kendall test, the double-mass curve of mean annual discharge versus rainfall, and rainfall runoff relationship before and after the 15 Khordad Dam operation. Multiple regression of flow discharge against rainfall and temperature was used to determine the residual trend at four meteorological and hydrological stations located upstream and downstream of the Qom Rood Watershed. Results showed that the temperature at the upstream and downstream stations did not have any significant trend, but a significant decreasing trend (P < .05) in rainfall was detected only in May (z = -1.66) at the downstream stations. There was a significant positive trend (P < .05) in rainfall in February (z = 2.22) and July (z = 2.15) at the upstream stations, and in October (z = 2.3) and November (z = 1.8) at the downstream stations. However, there was a noticeable decrease in monthly and annual flow discharge, and residual trend at 99% significance level at the downstream stations. At the upstream stations, the flow discharges had significant (P < .05) declining trend in all months, but annual flow discharge did not change significantly. Analysis of double mass curve between runoff and rainfall at the downstream stations showed an inconsistency in the line slope concordant with the time of 15 Khordad Dam operation. Annual mean discharge at the upstream stations did not show a significant change before and after 15 Khordad Dam operation. However, annual flow magnitude decreased significantlyby 87.5 and 81.7% in Shad Abad and KoohSefid, respectively. These results confirmed that natural driving forces did not affect flow discharge changes and the observed decreasing tendency in flow discharge at the downstream stations was due to 15 Khordad Dam, and at the upstream stations due to diversion/storage dams. These findings highlighted the role of human interference in changing the hydrologic regime in the study area based on which appropriate adaptive decisions can be made. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB Dissolution and precipitation of rock matrix are one of the most important processes of geological CO2 sequestration in reservoirs. They change connections of pore channels and properties of matrix, such as bulk density, microporosity and hydraulic conductivity. This study builds on a recently developed multi-layer model to account for dynamic changes of microporous matrix that can accurately predict variations in hydraulic properties and reaction rates due to dynamic changes in matrix porosity and pore connectivity. We apply the model to simulate the dissolution and precipitation processes of rock matrix in heterogeneous porous media to quantify (1) the effect of the reaction rate on dissolution and matrix porosity, (2) the effect of microporous matrix diffusion on the overall effective diffusion and (3) the effect of heterogeneity on hydraulic conductivity. The results show the CO2 storage influenced by factors including the matrix porosity change, reaction front movement, velocity and initial properties. We also simulated dissolution-induced permeability enhancement as well as effects of initial porosity heterogeneity. The matrix with very low permeability, which can be unresolved on X-ray CT, do contribute to flow patterns and dispersion. The concentration of reactant increases along the main fracture paths where the flow velocity increases. The product Ca++ shows the inversed distribution pattern against the H+ concentration. This demonstrates the capability of this model to investigate the complex CO2 reactive transport in real 3D heterogeneous porous media. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Chronic exposure to arsenic (As) through the consumption of contaminated groundwaters is a major threat to public health in South and Southeast Asia. The source of As-affected groundwaters is important to the fundamental understanding of the controls on As mobilization and subsequent transport throughout shallow aquifers. Using the stable isotopes of hydrogen and oxygen, the source of groundwater and the interactions between various water bodies were investigated in Cambodia's Kandal Province, an area which is heavily affected by As and typical of many circum-Himalayan shallow aquifers. Two-point mixing models based on delta D and delta O-18 allowed the relative extent of evaporation of groundwater sources to be estimated and allowed various water bodies to be broadly distinguished within the aquifer system. Model limitations are discussed, including the spatial and temporal variation in end member compositions. The conservative tracer Cl/Br is used to further discriminate between groundwater bodies. The stable isotopic signatures of groundwaters containing high As and/or high dissolved organic carbon plot both near the local meteoric water line and near more evaporative lines. The varying degrees of evaporation of high As groundwater sources are indicative of differing recharge contributions (and thus indirectly inferred associated organic matter contributions). The presence of high As groundwaters with recharge derived from both local precipitation and relatively evaporated surface water sources, such as ponds or flooded wetlands, are consistent with (but do not provide direct evidence for) models of a potential dual role of surface-derived and sedimentary organic matter in As mobilization.

AB Flood impact modelling requires reliable models for the simulation of flood processes. In recent years, flood inundation models have been remarkably improved and widely used for flood hazard simulation, flood exposure and loss analyses. In this study, we validate a 2D inundation model for the purpose of flood exposure analysis at the river reach scale. We validate the BASEMENT simulation model with insurance claims using conventional validation metrics. The flood model is established on the basis of available topographic data in a high spatial resolution for four test cases. The validation metrics were calculated with two different datasets; a dataset of event documentations reporting flooded areas and a dataset of insurance claims. The model fit relating to insurance claims is in three out of four test cases slightly lower than the model fit computed on the basis of the observed inundation areas. This comparison between two independent validation data sets suggests that validation metrics using insurance claims can be compared to conventional validation data, such as the flooded area. However, a validation on the basis of insurance claims might be more conservative in cases where model errors are more pronounced in areas with a high density of values at risk.

AB The accurate measurement of shallow flow velocities is crucial to understand and model the dynamics of sediment and pollutant transport by overland flow. In this study, a novel triple-tracer approach was used to re-evaluate and compare the traditional and well established dye and salt tracer techniques with the more recent thermal tracer technique in estimating shallow flow velocities. For this purpose a triple tracer (i.e. dyed-salted-heated water) was used. Optical and infrared video cameras and an electrical conductivity sensor were used to detect the tracers in the flow. Leading edge and centroid velocities of the tracers were measured and the correction factors used to determine the actual mean flow velocities from tracer measured velocities were compared and investigated. Experiments were carried out for different flow discharges (32-1813 ml s(-1)) on smooth acrylic, sand, stones and synthetic grass bed surfaces with 0.8, 4.4 and 13.2% slopes. The results showed that thermal tracers can be used to estimate shallow flow velocities, since the three techniques yielded very similar results without significant differences between them. The main advantages of the thermal tracer were that the movement of the tracer along the measuring section was more easily visible than it was in the real image videos and that it was possible to measure space-averaged flow velocities instead of only one velocity value, with the salt tracer. The correction factors used to determine the actual mean velocity of overland flow varied directly with Reynolds and Froude numbers, flow velocity and slope and inversely with flow depth and bed roughness. In shallow flows, velocity estimation using tracers entails considerable uncertainty and caution must be taken with these measurements, especially in field studies where these variables vary appreciably in space and time.

TI Drought-induced recharge promotes long-term storage of porewater

AB Subsurface storage of sulfate salts allows closed-basin wetlands in the semiarid Prairie Pothole Region (PPR) of North America to maintain moderate surface water salinity (total dissolved solids [TDS] from 1 to 10 g L-1), which provides critical habitat for communities of aquatic biota. However, it is unclear how the salinity of wetland ponds will respond to a recent shift in mid-continental climate to wetter conditions. To understand better the mechanisms that control surface-subsurface salinity exchanges during regional dry-wet climate cycles, we made a detailed geoelectrical study of a closed-basin prairie wetland (P1 in the Cottonwood Lake Study Area, North Dakota) that is currently experiencing record wet conditions. We found saline lenses of sulfate-rich porewater (TDS > 10 g L-1) contained in fine-grained wetland sediments 2-4 m beneath the bathymetric low of the wetland and within the currently ponded area along the shoreline of a prior pond stand (c. 1983). During the most recent drought (1988-1993), the wetland switched from a groundwater discharge to recharge function, allowing salts dissolved in surface runoff to move into wetland sediments beneath the bathymetric low of the basin. However, groundwater levels during this time did not decline to the elevation of the saline lenses, suggesting these features formed during more extended paleo-droughts and are stable in the subsurface on at least centennial timescales. We hypothesize a "drought-induced recharge" mechanism that allows wetland ponds to maintain moderate salinity under semiarid climate. Discharge of drought-derived saline groundwater has the potential to increase the salinity of wetland ponds during wet climate. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This article examines impacts of infrastructure development and climate variability on economic outcomes for the Amu Darya Basin in Central Asia. It aims to identify the most economically productive mix of expanded reservoir storage for economic benefit sharing to occur, in which economic welfare of all riparians is improved. Policies examined include four combinations of storage infrastructure for each of two climate futures. An empirical optimization model is developed and applied to identify opportunities for improving the welfare of Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, Afghanistan, and Turkmenistan. The analysis 1) characterizes politically constrained and economically optimized water-use patterns for these combinations of expanded reservoir storage capacity, 2) describes Pareto-Improving packages of expanded storage capacity that could raise economic welfare for all four riparians, and accounts for impacts for each of two climate scenarios. Results indicate that a combination of targeted water storage infrastructure and efficient water allocation could produce outcomes for which the discounted net present value of benefits are favorable for each riparian. Results identify a framework to provide economic motivation for all riparians to cooperate through development of water storage infrastructure. Our findings illustrate the principle that development of water infrastructure can expand the negotiation space by which all communities can gain economic benefits in the face of limited water supply. Still, despite our optimistic findings, patient and deliberate negotiation will be required to transform potential improvements into actual gains. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Among the urban aquatic pollutants, the most common is sediment which also acts as a transport medium, for many contaminants. Hence there is an increasing interest in being able to better predict the sediment wash-off from urban surfaces. The exponential wash-off model is the most widely used method to predict the sediment wash-off. Although a number of studies proposed various modifications to the original exponential wash-off equation, these studies mostly looked into one parameter in isolation thereby ignoring the interactions between the parameters corresponding to rainfall, catchment and sediment characteristics. Hence in this study we aim (a) to investigate the effect of rainfall intensity, surface slope and initial load on wash-off load in an integrated and systematic way and (b) to subsequently improve the exponential wash-off equation focusing on the effect of the aforementioned three parameters. A series of laboratory experiments were carried out in a full-scale setup, comprising of a rainfall simulator, a 1 m(2) bituminous road surface, and a continuous wash-off measuring system. Five rainfall intensities ranging from 33 to 155 mm/h, four slopes ranging from 2 to 16% and three initial loads ranging from 50 to 200 g/m(2) were selected based on values obtained from the literature. Fine sediment with a size range of 300-600 p.m was used for all of the tests. Each test was carried out for one hour with at least 9 wash-off samples per test collected. Mass balance checks were carried out for all the tests as a quality control measure to make sure that there is no significant loss of sand during the tests. Results show that the washed off sediment load at any given time is proportional to initial load for a given combination of rainfall intensity and surface slope. This indicates the importance of dedicated modelling of build-up so as to subsequently predict wash-off load. It was also observed that the maximum fraction that is washed off from the surface increases with both rainfall intensity and the surface slope. This observation leads to the second part of the study where the existing wash-off model is modified by introducing a capacity factor which defines this maximum fraction. This capacity factor is derived as a function of wash-off coefficient, making use of the correlation between the maximum fraction and the wash-off rate. Values of the modified wash-off coefficient are presented for all combinations of rainfall intensities and surface slopes, which can be transferred to other urban catchments with similar conditions.

AB Assessing how forest disturbance and climate variability affect streamflow components is critical for watershed management, ecosystem protection, and engineering design. Previous studies have mainly evaluated the effects of forest disturbance on total streamflow, rarely with attention given to its components (e.g., base flow and surface runoff), particularly in large watersheds (>1000 km(2)). In this study, the Upper Similkameen River watershed (1810 km(2)), an international watershed situated between Canada and the USA, was selected to examine how forest disturbance and climate variability interactively affect total streamflow, baseflow, and surface runoff. Baseflow was separated using a combination of the recursive digital filter method and conductivity mass balance method. Time series analysis and modified double mass curves were then employed to quantitatively separate the relative contributions of forest disturbance and climate variability to each streamflow component. Our results showed that average annual baseflow and baseflow index (baseflow/streamflow) were 113.3 +/- 35.6 mm year(-1) and 0.27 for 1954-2013, respectively. Forest disturbance increased annual streamflow, baseflow, and surface runoff of 27.7 +/- 13.7 mm, 7.4 +/- 3.6 mm, and 18.4 +/- 12.9 mm, respectively, with its relative contributions to the changes in respective streamflow components being 27.0 +/- 23.0%, 29.2 +/- 23.1%, and 25.7 +/- 23.4%, respectively. In contrast, climate variability decreased them by 74.9 +/- 13.7 mm, 17.9 +/- 3.6 mm, and 53.3 +/- 12.9 mm, respectively, with its relative contributions to the changes in respective streamflow components being 73.0 +/- 23.0%, 70.8 +/- 23.1% and 73.1 +/- 23.4%, respectively. Despite working in opposite ways, the impacts of climate variability on annual streamflow, baseflow, and surface runoff were of a much greater magnitude than forest disturbance impacts. This study has important implications for the protection of aquatic habitat, engineering design, and watershed planning in the context of future forest disturbance and climate change.

AB Water is an essential natural resource. Among many stressors, altered climate is exerting pressure on water resource systems, increasing its demand and creating a need for vulnerability assessments. The overall objective of this study was to develop a novel tool that can translate a theoretical concept (vulnerability of water resources (VWR)) to an operational framework mainly under altered temperature and precipitation, as well as for population change (smaller extent). The developed tool had three stages and utilized a novel systems thinking approach. Stage-1: Translating theoretical concept to characteristics identified from studies; Stage-2: Operationalizing characteristics to methodology in VWR; Stage-3: Utilizing the methodology for development of a conceptual modeling tool for VWR: WR-VISTA (Water Resource Vulnerability assessment conceptual model using Indicators selected by System's Thinking Approach). The specific novelties were: 1) The important characteristics in VWR were identified in Stage-1 (target system, system components, scale, level of detail, data source, frameworks, and indicator); 2) WR-VISTA combined two vulnerability assessments frameworks: the European's Driver-Pressu re-State-Impact-Response framework (DPSIR) and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's framework (IPCC's); and 3) used systems thinking approaches in VWR for indicator selection. The developed application was demonstrated in Kansas (overlying the High Plains region/Ogallala Aquifer, considered the "breadbasket of the world"), using 26 indicators with intermediate level of detail. Our results indicate that the western part of the state is vulnerable from agricultural water use and the eastern part from urban water use. The developed tool can be easily replicated to other regions within and outside the US. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Partial expansion was observed in stratified subsidence during foundation pit dewatering. However, the phenomenon was suspected to be an error because the compression of layers is known to occur when subsidence occurs. A slice of the subsidence cone induced by drawdown was selected as the prototype. Model tests were performed to investigate the phenomenon. The underlying confined aquifer was generated as a movable rigid plate with a hinge at one end. The overlying layers were simulated with remolded materials collected from a construction site. Model tests performed under the conceptual model indicated that partial expansion occurred in stratified settlements under coordination deformation and consolidation conditions. During foundation pit dewatering, rapid drawdown resulted in rapid subsidence in the dewatered confined aquifer. The rapidly subsiding confined aquifer top was the bottom deformation boundary of the overlying layers. Non-coordination deformation was observed at the top and bottom of the subsiding overlying layers. The subsidence of overlying layers was larger at the bottom than at the top. The layers expanded and became thicker. The phenomenon was verified using numerical simulation method based on finite difference method. Compared with numerical simulation results, the boundary effect of the physical tests was obvious in the observation point close to the movable endpoint. The tensile stress of the overlying soil layers induced by the underlying settlement of dewatered confined aquifer contributed to the expansion phenomenon. The partial expansion of overlying soil layers was defined as inversed rebound. The inversed rebound was induced by inversed coordination deformation. Compression was induced by the consolidation in the overlying soil layers because of drainage. Partial expansion occurred when the expansion exceeded the compression. Considering the inversed rebound, traditional layer-wise summation method for calculating subsidence should be revised and improved. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB We develop a new analytical infiltration model to determine water flow dynamics around layer interfaces during infiltration process in layered soils. The model mainly involves the analytical solutions to quadratic equations to determine the flux rates around the interfaces. Active water content profile behind the wetting front is developed based on the solution of steady state flow to dynamically update active parameters in sharp wetting front infiltration equations and to predict unsaturated flow in coarse layers before the front reaches an impeding fine layer. The effect of water backfill to saturate the coarse layers after the wetting front encounters the impeding fine layer is analytically expressed based on the active water content profiles. Comparison to the numerical solutions of the Richards equation shows that the new model can well capture water dynamics in relation to the arrangement of soil layers. The steady state active water content profile can be used to predict the saturation state of all layers when the wetting front first passes through these layers during the unsteady infiltration process. Water backfill effect may occur when the unsaturated wetting front encounters a fine layer underlying a coarse layer. Sensitivity analysis shows that saturated hydraulic conductivity is the parameter dictating the occurrence of unsaturated flow and water backfill and can be used to represent the coarseness of soil layers. Water backfill effect occurs in coarse layers between upper and lower fine layers when the lower layer is not significantly coarser than the upper layer. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID PRECIPITATION
AB The Murray-Darling Basin (MDB) is a large geographical region in southeastern Australia that contains many rivers and creeks, including Australia's three longest rivers, the Murray, the Murrumbidgee and the Darling. Understanding rainfall patterns in the MDB is very important due to the significant impact major events such as droughts and floods have on agricultural and resource productivity. We propose a model for modelling a set of monthly rainfall data obtained from stations in the MDB and for producing predictions in both the spatial and temporal dimensions. The model is a hierarchical spatio-temporal model fitted to geographical data that utilises both deterministic and data-derived components. Specifically, rainfall data at a given location are modelled as a linear combination of these deterministic and data-derived components. A key advantage of the model is that it is fitted in a step-by-step fashion, enabling appropriate empirical choices to be made at each step. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Permeability decline associated with the migration of natural reservoir fines impairs the well index of injection and production wells in aquifers and oilfields. In this study, we perform laboratory corefloods using aqueous solutions with different salinities in engineered rocks with different kaolinite content, yielding fines migration and permeability alteration. Unusual permeability growth has been observed at high salinities in rocks with low kaolinite concentrations. This has been attributed to permeability increase during particle detachment and re-attachment of already mobilised fines by electrostatic attraction to the rock in stagnant zones of the porous space. We refine the traditional model for fines migration by adding mathematical expressions for the particle re-attachment rate, particle detachment with delay relative to salinity decrease, and the attached-concentration-dependency of permeability. A one-dimensional flow problem that accounts for those three effects allows for an exact analytical solution. The modified model captures the observed effect of permeability increase at high water salinities in rocks with low kaolinite concentrations. The developed model matches the coreflooding data with high accuracy, and the obtained model coefficients vary within their usual intervals. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

DE Dual-polarization radar; Rainfall estimation; Evaporation; Mesoscale

ID WSR-88D
AB Implementation of dual-polarization radar should allow for improvements in quantitative precipitation estimates due to dual-polarization capability allowing for the retrieval of the second moment of the gamma drop size distribution. Knowledge of the shape of the DSD can then be used in combination with mesoscale model data to estimate the motion and evaporation of each size of drop falling from the height at which precipitation is observed by the radar to the surface. Using data from Central Missouri at a range between 130 and 140 km from the operational National Weather Service radar a rain drop tracing scheme was developed to account for the effects of evaporation, where individual raindrops hitting the ground were traced to the point in space and time where they interacted with the radar beam. The results indicated evaporation played a significant role in radar rainfall estimation in situations where the atmosphere was relatively dry. Improvements in radar estimated rainfall were also found in these situations by accounting for evaporation. The conclusion was made that the effects of raindrop evaporation were significant enough to warrant further research into the inclusion high resolution model data in the radar rainfall estimation process for appropriate locations.

AB Trends in monthly evapotranspiration (ET) rates across Nebraska, the most intensely irrigated state within the US, were calculated by the calibration-free version of the nonlinear complementary relationship of evaporation over the 1979-2015 period utilizing North American Regional Reanalysis (NARR) net radiation, 10-m wind velocity, as well as Parameter Regression Independent Slope Model (PRISM) air and dew-point temperature data. State-averaged modeled ET rates rose by 5.5 mm decade(-1) due to the presence of wide-spread large-scale irrigation projects in accordance with a 2.4 mm decade(-1) increase in PRISM precipitation (P) and a simultaneous -2.8 mm decade(-1) drop in United States Geological Survey's state-averaged annual streamflow rates, raising the state-wide ET to P ratio from 0.89 to 0.91 over the modeled time-period. ET rates over irrigated crops increased by 7 mm decade(-1) despite a -4.4 mm decade(-1) drop in precipitation rates. A similar increase in ET rates (6 mm decade(-1)) required 8.1 mm decade(-1) increase in precipitation rates across the non-irrigated Sand Hills of Nebraska. Published NARR ET rates are unable to pick up this unusual regional trend. Since an increase in precipitation rates should normally decrease the ET ratio, as predicted by the Budyko curve, this study yields evidence on how dramatically sustained large-scale irrigation can alter the regional hydrologic cycle not only through a) trivially depleting streamflow rates and/or lowering groundwater table levels; b) suppressing precipitation locally (while enhancing it a long distance downwind), but also; c) reversing the trajectory of the regional ET ratio under generally increasing trends of precipitation.

AB Reliable runoff estimation is important for design of water infrastructure and flood risk management in urban catchments. We developed a spatially distributed Precipitation-Runoff (P-R) model that explicitly represents the land cover information, performs integrated modelling of surface and subsurface components of the urban precipitation water cycle and flow routing. We conducted parameter calibration and validation for a small (21.255 ha) stormwater catchment in Trondheim City during Summer-Autumn events and season, and snow-influenced Winter-Spring seasons at high spatial and temporal resolutions of respectively 5 m x 5 m grid size and 2 min.
   The calibration resulted in good performance measures (Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency, NSE = 0.65-0.94) and acceptable validation NSE for the seasonal and snow-influenced periods. The infiltration excess surface runoff dominates the peak flows while the contribution of subsurface flow to the sewer pipes also augments the peak flows. Based on the total volumes of simulated flow in sewer pipes (Qsim) and precipitation (P) during the calibration periods, the Qsim/P ranges from 21.44% for an event to 56.50% for the Winter-Spring season, which are in close agreement with the observed volumes (Qobs/P). The lowest percentage of precipitation volume that is transformed to the total simulated runoff in the catchment (QT) is 79.77%. Computation of evapotranspiration (ET) indicated that the ET/P is less than 3% for the events and snow-influenced seasons while it is about 18% for the Summer-Autumn season. The subsurface flow contribution to the sewer pipes are markedly higher than the total surface runoff volume for some events and the Summer-Autumn season. The peakiest flow rates correspond to the Winter-Spring season. Therefore, urban runoff simulation for design and management purposes should include two-way interactions between the subsurface runoff and flow in sewer pipes, and snow-influenced seasons.
   The developed urban P-R model is useful for better computation of runoff generated from different land cover, for assessments of stormwater management techniques (e.g. the Low Impact Development or LID) and the impacts of land cover and climate change. There are some simplifications or limitations such as the runoff routing does not involve detailed sewer hydraulics, effects of leakages from water supply systems and faulty/illegal connections from sanitary sewer are not considered, the model cannot identify actual locations of the interactions between the subsurface runoff and sewer pipes and lacks parsimony.

AB For the shallow Westliches Leibnitzer feld aquifer (45 km(2)) we applied the recently developed methodology by Kupfersberger et al. (2017a) to derive the thermal upper boundary for a 3D heat transport model from observed air temperatures. We distinguished between land uses of grass and agriculture, sealed surfaces, forest and water bodies. To represent the heat flux from heated buildings and the mixture between different land surfaces in urban areas we ran the 1D vertical heat conduction module SoilTemp which is coupled to the heat transport model (using FEFLOW) on a time step basis. Over a simulation period of 23 years the comparison between measured and observed groundwater temperatures yielded NSE values ranging from 0.41 to 0.92 including readings at different depths. The model results showed that the thermal input signals lead to distinctly different vertical groundwater temperature distributions. To overcome the influence of specific warm or cold years we introduced the computation of an annual averaged groundwater temperature profile. With respect to the use of groundwater cooling or heating facilities we evaluated the application of vertically averaged statistical groundwater temperature distributions compared to the use of temperature distributions at selected dates. We concluded that the heat transport model serves well as an aquifer scale management tool to optimize the use of the shallow subsurface for thermal purposes and to analyze the impacts of corresponding measures on groundwater temperatures.

AB The study evaluates the water vapor isotopic compositions and its controls with special reference to Indian Summer Monsoon (ISM) season at Roorkee, India. Precipitation is usually a discrete event spatially and temporally in this part of the country, therefore, the information provided is limited, while, the vapors have all time availability and have a significant contribution in the hydrological cycle locally or over a regional scale. Hence for understanding the processes altering the various sources, its isotopic signatures were studied. The Isotope Water Vapour Line (Iso Val) was drawn together with the Global Meteoric Water Line (GMWL) and the best fit line was delta D = 5.42 * delta O-18 + 27.86. The precipitation samples were also collected during the study period and were best fitted with delta D = 8.20( +/- 0.18) * delta O-18 + 9.04( +/- 1. 16) in the Local Meteoric Water Line (LMWL). From the back trajectory analysis of respective vapor samples, it is unambiguous that three major sources viz; local vapor, western disturbance and monsoon vapor are controlling the fate of moisture over Roorkee. The d-excess in ground-level vapor (GLV) reveals the supply of recycled moisture from continental water bodies and evapo-transpiration as additional moisture sources to the study area. The intensive depletion in isotopic ratios was associated with the largescale convective activity and low-pressure/cyclonic/depression systems formed over Bay of Bengal. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB The interaction between surface water and groundwater through the hyporheic zone is recognized to be important as it impacts the water quantity and quality in both flow systems. Three-dimensional (3D) modeling is the most complete representation of a real-world hyporheic zone. However, 3D modeling requires extreme computational power and efforts; the sophistication is often significantly compromised by not being able to obtain the required input data accurately. Simplifications are therefore often needed. The objective of this study was to assess the accuracy of the vertically-averaged approximation compared to a more complete vertically-resolved model of the hyporheic zone. The groundwater flow was modeled by either a simple one-dimensional (1D) Dupuit approach or a two-dimensional (2D) horizontal/vertical model in boundary fitted coordinates, with the latter considered as a reference model. Both groundwater models were coupled with a 1D surface water model via the surface water depth. Applying the two models to an idealized pool-riffle sequence showed that the 1D Dupuit approximation gave comparable results in determining the characteristics of the hyporheic zone to the reference model when the stratum thickness is not very large compared to the surface water depth. Conditions under which the 1D model can provide reliable estimate of the seepage discharge, upwelling/downwelling discharges and locations, the hyporheic flow, and the residence time were determined.

AB Aquifer salinization has recently increased significantly due to human activity and has caused irreparable environmental and economic effects. In this research, a new method is proposed for modeling the vulnerability to salinity for the Ghaemshahr-juybar aquifer. Specifically, the GALDIT (Sea water intrusion) and TAWLBIC (Saltwater up-coning) indices were combined to produce a map of vulnerability (Comprehensive Salinity Index or CSI) to seawater intrusion of a region near the coast and saltwater up-coning away from the coast, respectively. Single parameter and removal layer sensitivity analysis were performed in order to identify the sensitive parameters and achieve optimal weights (through the single-parameter method) of contributing factors in all three methods. The three optimized methods produced were GALDIT-Opt, TAWLBIC-Opt and CSI-Opt. To assess the accuracy of the original maps and optimal ones, the Pearson correlation was used. Results indicated that the Pearson correlation of the optimized GALDIT, TAWLBIC and CSI model was better than GALDIT, TAWLBIC and CSI. The results show that the increase in correlation between EC (Electrical Conductivity), TDS (Total Dissolved Solids) and SAR (Sodium Adsorption Ratio) from the GALDIT model to the CSI-Opt model from values of 0.64, 0.56 and 0.68 has improved to values of 0.81, 0.88 and 0.91, respectively. The highest concentration of EC, with a value of 7050 mu s/cm, is sampled in the areas of the east and northwest of the Ghaemshahr-juybar aquifer, which are classified in the CSI-Opt model as high and very high vulnerability levels. The highest concentration of TDS and SAR has been found in the east, northwest and northeast of the Ghaemshahr-juybar aquifer with a value of 4724 ppm for TDS and 14 mg/l for SAR that have been modeled in the CSI-Opt index as highly vulnerable areas. Eventually, CSI mapping can be used as an efficient tool in prioritizing in terms of the vulnerability to aquifer salinity, carrying out adjustments, recharge, and adaptation policies for this issue.

AB Low flow conditions are governed by short-to-medium term weather conditions or long term climate conditions. This prorripts the question: given climate scenarios, is it possible to assess future extreme low flow conditions from climate data indices (CDIs)? Or should we rely on the conventional approach of using outputs of climate models as inputs to a hydrological model? Several CDIs were computed using 42 climate scenarios over the years 1961-2100 for two watersheds located in Quebec, Canada. The relationship between the CDIs and hydrological data indices (HDIs; 7- and 30-day low flows for two hydrological seasons) were examined through correlation analysis to identify the indices governing low flows. Results of the Mann-Kendall test, with a modification for autocorrelated data, clearly identified trends. A partial correlation analysis allowed attributing the observed trends in HD's to trends in specific CDIs. Furthermore, results showed that, even during the spatial validation process, the methodological framework was able to assess trends in low flow series from: (i) trends in the effective drought index (EDI) computed from rainfall plus snowmelt minus PET amounts over ten to twelve months of the hydrological snow cover season or (ii) the cumulative difference between rainfall and potential evapotranspiration over five months of the snow free season. For 80% of the climate scenarios, trends in HDIs were successfully attributed to trends in CDIs. Overall, this paper introduces an efficient methodological framework to assess future trends in low flows given climate scenarios. The outcome may prove useful to municipalities concerned with source water management under changing climate conditions. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Paleoclimate reconstructions are increasingly used to characterize annual climate variability prior to the instrumental record, to improve estimates of climate extremes, and to provide a baseline for climate change projections. To date, paleoclimate records have seers limited engineering use to estimate hydrologic risks because water systems models and managers usually require streamflow input at the monthly scale. This study explores the hypothesis that monthly streamflows can be adequately modeled by statistically decomposing annual flow reconstructions. To test this hypothesis, a multiple linear regression model for monthly streamflow reconstruction is presented that expands the set of predictors to include annual streamflow reconstructions, reconstructions of global circulation, and potential differences among regional tree-ring chronologies related to tree species and geographic location. This approach is used to reconstruct 600 years of monthly streamflows at two sites on the Bear and Logan rivers in northern Utah. Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiencies remain above zero (0.26-0.60) for all months except April and Pearson's correlation coefficients (R) are 0.94 and 0.88 for the Bear and Logan rivers, respectively, confirming that the model can adequately reproduce monthly flows during the reference period (10/1942 to 9/2015). Incorporating a flexible transition between the previous and concurrent annual reconstructed flows was the most important factor for model skill. Expanding the model to include global climate indices and regional tree-ring chronologies produced smaller, but still significant improvements in model fit. The model presented here is the only approach currently available to reconstruct monthly streamflows directly from tree-ring chronologies and climate reconstructions, rather than using resampling of the observed record. With reasonable estimates of monthly flow that extend back in time many centuries, water managers can challenge systems models with a larger range of natural variability in drought and pluvial events and better evaluate extreme events with recurrence intervals longer than the observed record. Establishing this natural baseline is critical when estimating future hydrologic risks under conditions of a non-stationary climate. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Hydrological consequences of alternative harvesting strategies in deciduous forest landscapes with seasonal snow cover have received relatively little attention. Most forest harvesting experiments in landscapes with seasonal snow cover have focused on clearcutting in coniferous forests. Few have examined alternative strategies such as selection or shelterwood cutting in deciduous stands whose hydrologic responses to harvesting may differ from those of conifers. This study presents results from a 31-year examination of hydrological response to and recovery from alternative harvesting strategies in a deciduous forest landscape with seasonal snow cover in central Ontario, Canada. A quantitative means of assessing hydrologic recovery to harvesting is also developed. Clearcutting resulted in increased water year (WY) runoff. This was accompanied by increased runoff in all seasons, with greatest relative increases in Summer. Direct runoff and baseflow from treatment catchments generally increased following harvesting, although annual peak streamflow did not. Largest increases in WY runoff and seasonal runoff as well as direct runoff and baseflow generally occurred in the selection harvest catchment, likely as a result of interception of hillslope runoff by a forest access road and redirection to the stream channel. Hydrologic recovery appeared to begin towards the end of the experimental period for several stream flow metrics but was incomplete for all harvesting strategies 15 years after harvesting. Geochemical tracing indicated that harvesting enhanced the relative importance of surface and near-surface water pathways on catchment slopes for all treatments, with the clearcut catchment showing the most pronounced and prolonged response. Such insights into water partitioning between flow pathways may assist assessments of the ecological and biogeochemical consequences of forest disturbance.

AB Bayesian inference using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) provides an explicit framework for stochastic calibration of hydrogeologic models accounting for uncertainties; however, the MCMC sampling entails a large number of model calls, and could easily become computationally unwieldy if the high-fidelity hydrogeologic model simulation is time consuming. This study proposes a surrogate-based Bayesian framework to address this notorious issue, and illustrates the methodology by inverse modeling a regional MODFLOW model. The high-fidelity groundwater model is approximated by a fast statistical model using Bagging Multivariate Adaptive Regression Spline (BMARS) algorithm, and hence the MCMC sampling can be efficiently performed. In this study, the MODFLOW model is developed to simulate the groundwater flow in an arid region of Oman consisting of mountain-coast aquifers, and used to run representative simulations to generate training dataset for BMARS model construction. A BMARS-based Sobol' method is also employed to efficiently calculate input parameter sensitivities, which are used to evaluate and rank their importance for the groundwater flow model system. According to sensitivity analysis, insensitive parameters are screened out of Bayesian inversion of the MODFLOW model, further saving computing efforts. The posterior probability distribution of input parameters is efficiently inferred from the prescribed prior distribution using observed head data, demonstrating that the presented BMARS-based Bayesian framework is an efficient tool to reduce parameter uncertainties of a groundwater system.

AB The interactions between the extremely shallow, funnel-shaped topography and dynamic processes in the North Branch (NB) of the Changjiang Estuary produce a particular type of saltwater intrusion, saltwater spillover (SSO), from the NB into the South Branch (SB). This dominant type of saltwater intrusion threatens the winter water supplies of reservoirs located in the estuary. Simulated SSO was weaker than actual SSO in previous studies, and this problem has not been solved until now. The improved ECOM-si model with the advection scheme HSIMT-TVD was applied in this study. Logarithmic and Chezy-Manning formulas of the bottom drag coefficient (BDC) were established in the model to investigate the associated effect on saltwater intrusion in the NB. Modeled data and data collected at eight measurement stations located in the NB from February 19 to March 1, 2017, were compared, and three skill assessment indicators, the correlation coefficient (CC), root-mean-square error (RMSE), and skill score (SS), of water velocity and salinity were used to quantitatively validate the model. The results indicated that the water velocities modeled using the Chezy-Manning formula of BDC were slightly more accurate than those based on the logarithmic BDC formula, but the salinities produced by the latter formula were more accurate than those of the former. The results showed that the BDC increases when water depth decreases during ebb tide, and the results based on the Chezy-Manning formula were smaller than those based on the logarithmic formula. Additionally, the landward net water flux in the upper reaches of the NB during spring tide increases based on the Chezy-Manning formula, and saltwater intrusion in the NB was enhanced, especially in the upper reaches of the NB. At a transect in the upper reaches of the NB, the net transect water flux (NTWF) is upstream in spring tide and downstream in neap tide, and the values produced by the Chezy-Manning formula are much larger than those based on the logarithmic formula. Notably, SSO during spring tide was 1.8 times larger based on the Chezy-Manning formula than that based on the logarithmic formula. The model underestimated SSO and salinity at the hydrological stations in the SB based on the logarithmic BDC formula but successfully simulated SSO and the temporal variations in salinity in the SB using the Chezy-Manning formula of BDC.

ID RISK-BASED DESIGN; POINT ESTIMATE METHODS; FLOOD; COSTS; MODEL
AB Hydrosystems engineering designs involve analysis of hydrometric data (e.g., rainfall, floods) and use of hydrologic/hydraulic models, all of which contribute various degrees of uncertainty to the design process. Uncertainties in hydrosystem designs can be generally categorized into aleatory and epistemic types. The former arises from the natural randomness of hydrologic processes whereas the latter are due to knowledge deficiency in model formulation and model parameter specification. This study shows that the presence of epistemic uncertainties induces uncertainty in determining the design capacity. Hence, the designer needs to quantify the uncertainty features of design capacity to determine the capacity with a stipulated performance reliability under the design condition. Using detention basin design as an example, the study illustrates a methodological framework by considering aleatory uncertainty from rainfall and epistemic uncertainties from the runoff coefficient, curve number, and sampling error in design rainfall magnitude. The effects of including different items of uncertainty and performance reliability on the design detention capacity are examined. A numerical example shows that the mean value of the design capacity of the detention basin increases with the design return period and this relation is found to be practically the same regardless of the uncertainty types considered. The standard deviation associated with the design capacity, when subject to epistemic uncertainty, increases with both design frequency and items of epistemic uncertainty involved. It is found that the epistemic uncertainty due to sampling error in rainfall quantiles should not be ignored. Even with a sample size of 80 (relatively large for a hydrologic application) the inclusion of sampling error in rainfall quantiles resulted in a standard deviation about 2.5 times higher than that considering only the uncertainty of the runoff coefficient and curve number. Furthermore, the presence of epistemic uncertainties in the design would result in underestimation of the annual failure probability of the hydrosystem and has a discounting effect on the anticipated design return period.

AB Artificial recharge measures have been adopted to control the drawdown of confined aquifers and the ground subsidence caused by dewatering during deep excavation in Tianjin, Shanghai and other regions in China. However, research on recharge theory is still limited. Additionally, confined aquifers consisting of silt and silty sand in Tianjin have lower hydraulic conductivities than those consisting of sand or gravel, and the feasibility and effectiveness of recharge methods in these semiconfined aquifers urgently require investigation. A series of single-well and multiwell pumping and recharge tests was conducted at a metro station excavation site in Tianjin. The test results showed that it was feasible to recharge silt and silty sand semiconfined aquifers, and, to a certain extent, the hydrogeological parameters obtained from the pumping tests could be used to predict the water level rise during single-well recharge. However, the predicted results underestimated the water level rise near the recharge well (within 7 m) by approximately 10-25%, likely because the permeability coefficient around the well was reduced during the recharge process. Pressured recharge significantly improved the efficiency of the recharge process. Maintaining the recharge and pumping rates at a nearly equal level effectively controlled the surrounding surface and building settlement. However, the surrounding surface subsidence tended to rapidly develop when recharge stopped. Therefore, the recharge process should continue and gradually stop after the pumping stops. The twin-well combined recharge technique can be used to control the head loss of an aquifer when one of the recharge wells requires pumping to solve the associated clogging problems.

AB Partitioning of rainfall at the soil-atmosphere interface is important for both surface and subsurface hydrology, and influences many events of major hydrologic interest such as runoff generation, aquifer recharge, and transport of pollutants in surface waters as well as the vadose zone. This partitioning is achieved through the process of infiltration that has been widely investigated at the local scale, and more recently also at the field scale, by models that were designed for horizontal surfaces. However, infiltration, overland flows, and deep flows in most real situations are generated by rainfall over sloping surfaces that bring in additional effects. Therefore, existing models for local infiltration into homogeneous and layered soils and those as for field-scale infiltration, have to be adapted to account for the effects of surface slope. Various studies have investigated the role of surface slope on infiltration based on a theoretical formulations for the dynamics of infiltration, extensions of the Green-Ampt approach, and from laboratory and field experiments. However, conflicting results have been reported in the scientific literature on the role of surface slope on infiltration. We summarize the salient points from previous studies and provide plausible reasons for discrepancies in conclusions of previous authors, thus leading to a critical assessment of the current state of our understanding on this subject. We offer suggestions for future efforts to advance our knowledge of infiltration over sloping surfaces. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Downscaled General Circulation Models (GCMs) output are used to forecast climate change and provide information used as input for hydrological modelling. Given that our understanding of climate change points towards an increasing frequency, timing and intensity of extreme hydrological events, there is therefore the need to assess the ability of downscaled GCMs to capture these extreme hydrological events. Extreme hydrological events play a significant role in regulating the structure and function of rivers and associated ecosystems. In this study, the Indicators of Hydrologic Alteration (IHA) method was adapted to assess the ability of simulated streamflow (using downscaled GCMs (dGCMs)) in capturing extreme river dynamics (high and low flows), as compared to streamflow simulated using historical climate data from 1960 to 2000. The ACRU hydrological model was used for simulating streamflow for the 13 water management units of the uMngeni Catchment, South Africa. Statistically downscaled climate models obtained from the Climate System Analysis Group at the University of Cape Town were used as input for the ACRU Model. Results indicated that, high flows and extreme high flows (one in ten year high flows/large flood events) were poorly represented both in terms of timing, frequency and magnitude. Simulated streamflow using dGCMs data also captures more low flows and extreme low flows (one in ten year lowest flows) than that captured in streamflow simulated using historical climate data. The overall conclusion was that although dGCMs output can reasonably be used to simulate overall streamflow, it performs poorly when simulating extreme high and low flows. Streamflow simulation from dGCMs must thus be used with caution in hydrological applications, particularly for design hydrology, as extreme high and low flows are still poorly represented, This, arguably calls for the further improvement of downscaling techniques in order to generate climate data more relevant and useful for hydrological applications such as in design hydrology. Nevertheless, the availability of downscaled climatic output provide the potential of exploring climate model uncertainties in different hydro climatic regions at local scales where forcing data is often less accessible but more accurate at finer spatial scales and with adequate spatial detail.

AB Deoxynivalenol (DON) is a Fusarium mycotoxin that frequently contaminates cereal and cereal-based food and induces liver injury. This study evaluated the protective role of silymarin nanoparticles (SILNPs) and inulin nanoparticles (INNPs) against DON-induced liver injury in rats. Eleven groups of rats were treated orally for 3 weeks as follows: the control group, DON-treated group (5 mg/kg b.w.); INNPs-treated groups at low (LD) or high (HD) dose (100 or 200 mg/kg b.w.); SILPNs-treated group (50 mg/kg b.w.); SILNPs plus INNPs(LD) or INNPs(HD)-treated groups; INNPs(LD) or INNPs(HD) plus DON-treated groups and DON plus SILNPs and INNPs(LD) or INNPs(HD)-treated groups. Blood and tissue samples were collected for different analyses. The results revealed that the practical sizes were 200 and 98 nm for SILNPs and INNPs respectively. DON increased liver enzymes activity, lipid profile, serum cytokines, number and percentage of chromosomal aberration, DNA fragmentation and comet score. It disturbed the oxidative stress markers, down regulated gene expression and induced histological changes in the liver tissue. Treatment with DON and SILNPs and/or INNPs at the two tested doses improved all the tested parameters and SILNPs plus INNPs(HD) normalized most of these parameters in DON-treated animals. SILNPs and INNPs could be promising candidates as hepatoprotective against DON or other hepatotoxins. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Of the 14 extant scorpion families, Buthidae has the most thoroughly characterized venoms. Most of this characterization, however, has been limited to species with medically significant stings, including members of the Centruroides genus, which have caused human deaths (e.g., Centruroides sculpturatus). To understand the origin and evolution of highly toxic venoms, we should also characterize the more harmless venoms of close relatives. We used Illumina sequencing to separately characterize the venom gland transcriptomes of a male and female Hentz striped scorpion (Centruroides hentzi) and performed independent quantitative mass-spectrometry analysis of the venom from each individual, providing the first full venom characterization of a Centruroides species that poses no serious threat to humans. We identified 59 venom proteins that were proteomically confirmed, 63 additional transcripts that were identified on the basis of homology to known toxins, and 355 nontoxins expressed in the venom-glands. The most abundant toxins belonged to the Na+ and K+-channel toxin classes. Antimicrobial peptides and peptidases were also identified, along with a large group of venom proteins that could not be classified based on homology, suggesting C hentzi is a source of previously untapped toxin diversity.

ID RATTLESNAKE ENVENOMATION; ADVERSE-REACTIONS; MANAGEMENT; ANTIVENOM;
   SHOCK
AB Objective: to describe the clinical presentation of two canines present in anaphylactic shock secondary to rattlesnake envenomation. In both cases, there was no previous documented previous envenomation event and the initial sensitization required for anaphylactic response is believed to be secondary to Crotalus atrox toxoid vaccine.
   Case description: In the first case, a 12-year-old golden retriever present for collapse, severe hematochezia, and vomiting after first time envenomation from a suspected western diamondback rattlesnake. The patient presented in severe hypovolemic shock and required aggressive fluid therapy, antivenom, anti-emetics, and pain management. The patient made a full recovery within 24 hours. In the second case, an 8-year old English setter presented for acute collapse, vomiting, and facial swelling after suspected first time envenomation from a suspected Prairie rattlesnake. The patient presented in severe hypovolemic shock with cardiac arrhythmias and required aggressive fluid therapy, antivenom, pain control, anti-emetics, and antibiotics. The patient made a full recovery after three days of hospitalization. Both patients had been previously vaccinated with the C. atrox vaccine.
   Conclusion: This case report documents suspected anaphylaxis in two canine patients after first time envenomation by a rattlesnake. Both patients were previously vaccinated by the Crotalus atrox toxoid, which is hypothesized to be the initial inciting trigger. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The red-bellied black snake (Pseudechis porphyriacus, Elapidae) is one of several species of venomous snakes most commonly implicated in human and domestic animal envenoming in Australia. Human systemic envenoming can present with myotoxicity that may include myoglobinuria; hemoglobinuria and intravascular hemolysis; thrombocytopenia, anticoagulant coagulopathy, and, rarely, mild cranial nerve palsies. Pseudechis porphyriacus envenoming can also feature significant local morbidity such as ecchymoses, bleeding, pain and necrosis. Some envenomed patients may develop progressive thickness necrosis independent of secondary infection, and occasionally require surgical debridement. Uncommonly, some digital envenoming may cause more severe deeper tissue pathology that justifies dermotomy and/or distal phalangeal amputation. Presented are two patients with significant local morbidity from P. porphyriacus envenoming. An 18-month old girl received a protracted envenoming on her right foot, while a 38-year old male professional zoologist was envenomed on the third digit of his right hand. Each patient experienced myotoxicity, one had anticoagulant coagulopathy, and both developed clinically significant local morbidity including persistent bleeding, ecchymoses, local necrosis and pain; each required extensive treatment and variably prolonged admission. Noted also were transiently elevated D-dimer with low-normal or normal fibrinogen levels. The progressive necrosis and subsequent chronic pathologic changes with ischemia of the latter patient's digit eventually required a dermotomy and amputation of the distal phalanx. The pediatric patient did not require extensive wound debridement, but experienced prolonged difficulty in ambulation because of slowly resolving wound discomfort. Factors that may contribute to the severity of local morbidity of P. porphyriacus envenoming are considered, and management of envenoming by this taxon is briefly reviewed.

AB The Reef Stonefish (Synanceia verrucosa) is one of the most dangerous venomous fish known, and has caused occasional human fatalities. The present study was designed to examine some of the pathological effects of the venom from this fish in Sprague Dawley rats. Crude venom was extracted from venom glands of the dorsal spines of stonefish specimens collected from coral reefs in the Gulf of Aqaba (in the northeastern branch of the Red Sea). The rats were given intramuscular injections of the venom and acute toxicity and effect on selected serum marker enzymes as well as normal architecture of vital organs were evaluated. The rat 24 h LD50 was 38 mu g/kg body weight. The serum biochemical markers; alanine transaminase (ALT), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and creatine kinase (CK) increased after 6 h of administration of a sub lethal dose of the venom and remained significantly raised at 24 h. Amylase levels also significantly increased after venom injection. The venom caused histological damage manifested as an interstitial hemorrhage, inflammatory cell infiltration, and necrosis. The demonstrated rises in the levels of different critical biochemical parameters in the serum may have led to the observed abnormal morphological changes in these organs. These results may account for some of the clinical manifestations observed in victims of stonefish envenomation. Thus, the presented data provide further in vivo evidence of the stonefish toxic effects that may threaten human life and call for the need for special measures to be considered.

AB The entomopathogenic Photorhabdus luminescens TT01 is a promoting bacterium that controls effectively many insect pests. Indeed, it exhibited a mortality rate of 32.36% against the first instar larvae of the turnip moth Agrotis segetum, when it was used at a concentration of 5 x 10(7) cells/ml but no toxicity against the second instar larvae in the same condition. P. luminescens TT01 oral toxicity is associated to septicaemia since cells fraction exhibited the highest mortality rate of 34%. In order to enhance P. luminescens TT01 insecticidal potential, combination with Bacillus thuringiensis Vip3Aa16 toxin was tested. An improvement of insecticidal activity was shown. Indeed, 100% mortality of A. segetum first instar larvae was obtained after 2 days of treatment, when using TT01 cells and Vip3Aa16 toxin at a concentration of 5 x 10(7) cells/ml and 9.025 ng/cm(2), respectively. Moreover, growth inhibition rate of 45% of the second instar larvae was observed, when using the same combination. A. segetum mortality could be the result of several alterations in the midgut epithelium caused by Vip3Aa16 toxin, allowing a rapid invasion of the hemocoel by TT01 cells as demonstrated by histopathological study. Clear symptoms of intoxication were observed for all combinations tested, including swelling, vesicle formation, cytoplasm vacuolization and brush border membrane lysis. Taken together, these results promote the use of P. luminescens TT01 as a potent bioinsecticide to control effectively A. segetum by oral treatment in a mixture with Vip3Aa16 toxin.

   Supply chain; Supply disruption; Stock-out; Recording; Monitoring
AB Home-based records (HBRs) provide an effective, inexpensive mechanism for recording and tracking infant vaccinations, yet stock-outs prevent HBRs from fulfilling their intended function. We describe the annual occurrence of HBR stock-outs during 2014-2016 reported by national immunization programmes to the WHO and UNICEF on the Joint Reporting Form on Immunization. During 2014-16, 48 countries reported at least one HBR stock-out. Thirteen countries reported HBR stock-outs for two of the three years. Forty-four countries reported two or more HBR funding sources in 2016. Challenges persist in ensuring continuous availability of HBRs. HBR stock-outs have important implications as they may impact continuity-of-care, increase inefficiencies at the point-of-care and reduce the ability of caregivers to be effective health advocates. Identifying mechanisms for preventing stock-outs should be a focus of attention for programmes and development partners. Expanded efforts are required to better understand the underlying causes of HBR stock-outs and identify solutions. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

ID AUTISM
AB In Italy, in 2016, we conducted a cross-sectional survey to estimate vaccine hesitancy and investigate its determinants among parents of children aged 16-36 months.
   Data on parental attitudes and beliefs about vaccinations were collected through a questionnaire administered online or self-administered at pediatricians' offices and nurseries. Parents were classified as pro-vaccine, vaccine-hesitant or anti-vaccine, according to self-reported tetanus and measles vaccination status of their child. Multivariable logistic regression was used to investigate factors associated with hesitancy.
   A total of 3130 questionnaires were analysed: 83.7% of parents were pro-vaccine, 15.6% vaccine hesitant and 0.7% anti-vaccine. Safety concerns are the main reported reason for refusing (38.1%) or interrupting (42.4%) vaccination. Anti-vaccine and hesitant parents are significantly more afraid than pro-vaccine parents of short-term (85.7 and 79.7% vs 60.4%) and long-term (95.2 and 72.3% vs 43.7%) vaccine adverse reactions. Most pro-vaccine and hesitant parents agree about the benefits of vaccinations. Family pediatricians are considered a reliable source of information by most pro-vaccine and hesitant parents (96.9 and 83.3% respectively), against 45% of anti-vaccine parents. The main factors associated with hesitancy were found to be: not having received from a paediatrician a recommendation to fully vaccinate their child [adjusted odds ratio (AOR): 3.21, 95% CI: 2.14-4.79], having received discordant opinions on vaccinations (AOR: 1.64, 95% CI: 1.11-2.43), having met parents of children who experienced serious adverse reactions (AOR: 1.49, 95% CI: 1.03-2.15), and mainly using non-traditional medical treatments (AOR: 2.05, 95% CI: 1.31-3.19).
   Vaccine safety is perceived as a concern by all parents, although more so by hesitant and anti-vaccine parents. Similarly to pro-vaccine parents, hesitant parents consider vaccination an important prevention tool and trust their family pediatricians, suggesting that they could benefit from appropriate communication interventions. Training health professionals and providing homogenous information about vaccinations, in line with national recommendations, are crucial for responding to their concerns. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Streptococcus equi ssp. zooepidemicus (SEZ) is an important pathogen of swine streptococcal diseases and can infect a wide range of animals as well as human beings. The absence of effective vaccine confounds the control of SEZ infection. Sec_205, a novel protein identified in the previous study, was inducibly over expressed in Escherichia coli in the present study. The purified recombinant protein could elicit a significant humoral antibody response and provide efficient protection against lethal challenge of SEZ C55138 in mouse model. The protection against SEZ infection was mediated by specific antibodies to Sec_205 to some extent and was identified by the passive protection assay. The Sec_205 was an in vivo-induced antigen confirmed by the real-time PCR and could adhere to the Hep-2 cells by the inhibition assay. These suggest that Sec_205 may play a vital role in pathogenicity and serve as a new vaccine candidate against SEZ infection. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background: Viral clearance of human HBV infection largely depends on the age of exposure. Thus, a mouse model with age-dependent immune response and immune-tolerance for HBV infection was established.
   Methods: HBVRag1 mice were generated by crossing Rag1(-/-) mice with HBV-Tg mice. Following adoptive transfer of splenocytes adult (8-9 weeks old) and young (3 weeks old) HBVRagl mice were named as HBVRag-ReA and HBVRag-ReY mice respectively. The biochemical parameters that were associated with viral load and immune function, as well as the histological evaluation of the liver tissues between the two mouse models were detected. The immune tolerance of HBVRag-ReY mice that were reconstituted at the early stages of life was evaluated by quantitative hepatitis B core antibody assay, adoptive transfer, and modulation of gut microbiota with the addition of antibiotics.
   Results: HBVRag-ReA mice indicated apparent hepatocytes damage, clearance of HBsAg and production of HBsAb and HBcAb. HBVRag-ReY mice did not develop ALT elevation, and produced HBcAb and HBsAg. A higher number of hepatic CDS+ T and B cells promoted clearance of HBsAg in HBVRag-ReA mice following 30 days of lymphocyte transfer. In contrast to HBVRag-ReA mice, HBVRag-ReY mice exhibited higher levels of Th1/Th2 cytokines. HBVRag-ReY mice exhibited significantly higher (P < .01, approximately 10-fold) serum quantitative anti-HBc levels than HBV-Tg mice, which might be similar to the phase of immune clearance and immune tolerance in human HBV infection. Furthermore, the age related tolerance in HBVRag-ReY mice that were sensitive to antibiotic treatment was different from that noted in HBV-Tg mice. GS-9620 could inhibit the production of HBsAg, whereas HBV vaccination could induce sustained seroconversion in HBVRag-ReY mice with low levels of HBsAg.
   Conclusions: The present study described a mouse model with age-dependent immunity and immune tolerance for HBV infection in vivo, which may mimic chronic HBV infection in humans. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI An assessment of shedding with the oral rabies virus vaccine strain SPBN

ID HUMAN ADENOVIRUS; SKUNKS; SAFETY; CHALLENGES; INFECTION; WILDLIFE; FOXES
AB A safety requirement for live vaccines is investigating possible shedding in recipients since the presence of replication competent vaccine in secretions could result in direct and indirect horizontal transmission. This is especially relevant for oral rabies vaccine baits that are deliberately distributed into the environment. In the current study, survival of an oral rabies virus vaccine, SPBN GASGAS, was examined in excretions from different target and non-target species; red fox, raccoon dog, small Indian mongoose, raccoon, striped skunk, domestic dog, domestic cat and domestic pig. Saliva and (pooled) fecal samples collected at different time points after oral administration of the vaccine strain were examined for the presence of viral RNA (rt-PCR). All PCR-positive and a subset of PCR-negative samples were subsequently investigated for the presence of infectious virus by isolation in cell culture (RTCIT). Up to 7 days post vaccine administration viral RNA could be detected in 50 of 758 fecal samples but no infectious virus was detected in any of the examined PCR-positive fecal samples. In contrast, RNA-fragments were detected in 248 of 1053 saliva swabs for an extended period (up to 10 days) after vaccine administration, but viable virus was only present during the first hours post vaccine administration in 38 samples. No infectious vaccine virus was isolated in saliva swabs taken 24 h or more after vaccine administration. Hence, no active shedding of the vaccine virus SPBN GASGAS after oral administration occurred and the virus isolated during the initial hours was material originally administered and not a result of virus replication within the host. Thus, potential horizontal transmission of this vaccine virus is limited to a short period directly after vaccine bait uptake. It can be concluded that the environmental risks associated with shedding after distributing vaccine baits containing SPBN GASGAS are negligible. (C) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Background: Antibodies to measles, mumps, and rubella decline 3% per year on average, and have a high degree of individual variation. Yet, individual variations and differences across antigens are not well understood. To better understand potential implications on individual and population susceptibility, we reanalyzed longitudinal data to identify patterns of seropositivity and persistence.
   Methods: Children vaccinated with the second dose of measles, mumps, rubella vaccine (MMR2) at 4-6 years of age were followed up to 12 years post-vaccination. The rates of antibody decline were assessed using regression models, accounting for differences between and within subjects.
   Results: Most of the 302 participants were seropositive throughout follow-up (96% measles, 88% mumps, 79% rubella). The rate of antibody decline was associated with MMR2 response and baseline titer for measles and age at first dose of MMR (MMR1) for rubella. No demographic or clinical factors were associated with mumps rate of decline. One month post-MMR2, geometric mean titer (GMT) to measles was high (3892 mIU/mL), but declined on average 9.7% per year among those with the same baseline titer and <2-fold increase post-MMR2. Subjects with >= 2-fold experienced a slower decline (<= 7.4%). GMT to rubella was 149 one month post-MMR2, declining 2.6% and 5.9% per year among those who received MMRI at 12-15 months and >15 months, respectively. GMT to mumps one month post-MMR2 was 151, declining 9.2% per year. Only 14% of subjects had the same persistence trends for all antigens.
   Conclusions: The rate of antibody decay varied substantially among individuals and the 3 antigen groups. A fast rate of decline coupled with high variation was observed for mumps, yet no predictors were identified. Future research should focus on better understanding waning titers to mumps and its impacts on community protection and individual susceptibility, in light of recent outbreaks in vaccinated populations.

AB Botulinum neurotoxins (BoNT) are the most toxic proteins for humans. BoNTs are single chain proteins with an N-terminal light chain (LC) and a C-terminal heavy chain (HC). HC comprises a translocation domain (HCN) and a receptor binding domain (HCc). Currently, there are no approved vaccines against botulism. This study tests a recombinant, full-length BoNT/A1 versus LCHCN/A1 and HCc/A1 as vaccine candidates against botulism. Recombinant, full-length BoNT/Al was detoxified by engineering 3-amino acid mutations (E224A/R363A/Y366F) (M-BoNT/A1) into the LC to eliminate catalytic activity, which reduced toxicity in a mouse model of botulism by >10(6)-fold relative to native BoNT/A1. As a second step to improve vaccine safety, an additional mutation (W1266A) was engineered in the ganglioside binding pocket, resulting in reduced receptor binding, to produce M-BoNT/A1(w). M-BoNT/A1(w) vaccination protected against challenge by 10(6) LD50 Units of native BoNT/A1, while M-BoNT/A1 or M-BoNT/A1(w) vaccination equally protected against challenge by native BoNT/A2, a BoNT subtype. Mice vaccinated with M-BoNT/A1w surviving BoNT challenge had dominant antibody responses to the LCHCN domain, but varied antibody responses to HCc. Sera from mice vaccinated with M-BoNT/A1(w) also neutralized BoNT/A1 action on cultured neuronal cells. The cell- and mouse-based assays measured different BoNT-neutralizing antibodies, where M-BoNT/A1(w) elicited a strong neutralizing response in both assays. Overall, M-BoNT/A1(w), with defects in multiple toxin functions, elicits a potent immune response to BoNT/A challenge as a vaccine strategy against botulism and other toxin-mediated diseases.

AB The attenuated recombinant Vibrio cholerae O1 vaccine strain CVD 103-HgR, re-developed as PXVX0200, elicits a rapid serum vibriocidal antibody (SVA) response and protects against cholera diarrhea in volunteer challenge studies. We performed a phase 3, placebo controlled, double blind, multi-center study to further assess the safety, immunogenicity, and lot-to-lot consistency of PXVX0200. Adult volunteers 18-45 years of age were randomized 8:1 to receive a single dose of 1 x 10(9) CFU of PXVX0200 from three production lots or saline placebo. Immunogenicity endpoints included SVA and anti-cholera toxin (CT) antibody levels on days 1, 11, 29, 91 and 181. Safety was assessed by comparing solicited signs and symptoms on days 1-8, unsolicited adverse events through day 29 and serious adverse events through day 181. A total of 3146 participants were enrolled, including 2795 vaccine and 351 placebo recipients. The SVA seroconversion rates at day 11 were 94% and 4% in the PXVX0200 and placebo recipients, respectively (P < .0001). Cumulative SVA seroconversion occurred among 96% of vaccine recipients. PXVX0200 SVA GMTs peaked on day 11 and remained significantly higher than placebo through day 181 while the fold-rise over baseline in PXVX0200 anti-CT antibody was significantly greater than placebo at every post-vaccination time point. Most reactogenicity was mild and resolved within 1-3 days with headache and diarrhea more frequently reported in PXVX0200 recipients. There were no differences in unsolicited adverse events and no study-related serious adverse events. Immunogenicity and safety endpoints were equivalent between the three production lots.

AB Seneca Valley virus (SVV) infection in pigs is associated with porcine idiopathic vesicular disease (PIVD). Outbreaks of SVV infection in pig herds have been reported in several Asia and Americas countries. Recently, a series of outbreaks of SVV infection occurred in China, Canada, Thailand and the United States. However, no available vaccines have been developed to limit the transmission of SVV. The SVV CH-FJ-2017 from Fujian province in China is a representative of the epidemic strains, and shows 98.5-99.9% capsid protein amino acid identity with the recent SVV strains. In the present study, we developed a SVV CH-FJ-2017 inactivated vaccine. The SVV was produced by cultivation of BHK-21 cells in roller bottles, inactivated with binary ethylenimine, and mixed with oil adjuvant (Montanide ISA). The immunogenicity of the inactivated vaccine in pigs was evaluated by neutralizing test, and the immunized pigs were challenged with SVV CH-FJ-2017. The results showed that animals receiving one dose of the inactivated vaccine (2 mu g/dose) with oil adjuvant developed high neutralizing antibody titers and showed no clinical signs after virus challenge comparing with the non-vaccinated animals, indicating a good protective efficacy of the produced vaccine against SVV infection. This is the first reported SVV vaccine that can be used for control of SVV infection in pigs. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The objective of this study is to determine the immunogenicity and safety of our novel anti-gastrin vaccine that is composed of the common amino-terminal portions of human carboxy-amidated gastrin-17 (G17) and glycine-extended gastrin-17 (gly-G17) as well as the common carboxy-terminal portion of the gastrin precursor progastrin (in a 50:50 mixture) all covalently linked to tetanus toxoid (TT) via peptide spacers.
   The vaccine, or immunogen, was injected intramuscularly into the legs of BALB/c mice, which produced high serum titres of specific IgG antibodies and IFN-gamma in their spleen cells, identifiable by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and enzyme-linked immunospot assay (ELISPOT), respectively. TT as the protein carrier effectively enhanced the antigenic epitopes' humoural and cellular immune responses, unlike the antigenic epitopes alone or the immunogen's adjuvant emulsion system (AES), all of which failed to provoke any obvious immune response. Notably, the animals' body weights increased significantly after immunization (P < .01), while their haematology and serum biochemistry were all generally normal, and the gross anatomy of their main organs (e.g., heart, liver, spleen, lung, kidney) showed no obvious histopathological changes.

AB Background: Annual influenza vaccination is a key to preventing widespread influenza infections. Recent reports of influenza vaccine effectiveness (VE) indicate that vaccination in prior years may reduce VE in the current season, suggesting vaccine interference. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the potential effect of repeat influenza vaccinations in the presence of vaccine interference.
   Methods: Using literature-based parameters, an age-structured influenza equation-based transmission model was used to determine the optimal vaccination strategy, while considering the effect of varying levels of interference.
   Results: The model shows that, even in the presence of vaccine interference, revaccination reduces the influenza attack rate and provides individual benefits. Specifically, annual vaccination is a favored strategy over vaccination in alternate years, as long as the level of residual protection is less than 58% or vaccine interference effect is minimal. Furthermore, the negative impact of vaccine interference may be offset by increased vaccine coverage levels.
   Conclusions: Even in the presence of potential vaccine interference, our work provides a population-level perspective on the potential merits of repeated influenza vaccination. This is because repeat vaccination groups had lower attack rates than groups that omitted the second vaccination unless vaccine interference was at very high, perhaps implausible, levels.

AB Introduction: Influenza vaccination has been shown to be safe and effective against influenza and in the prevention of complicating secondary respiratory illnesses. However, its uptake in young children remains low. This study explored the views, attitudes and practices of parents and primary care providers (PCPs) on their knowledge and acceptance of influenza vaccination in children under 5.
   Methods: Using a cross-sectional qualitative research design, we conducted 30 in-depth interviews with PCPs (i.e., general practitioners, practice nurses, maternal and child health nurses, and pharmacists) and five focus groups with parents (n = 50) between June 2014 and July 2015 in Melbourne, Australia. Data were thematically analysed.
   Results: Parents thought the vaccine could cause influenza, and influenza vaccination was not necessary for their children as they needed to build their own 'immunity'. Parents said that they would consider vaccinating their children if recommended by their GP and if the influenza vaccine was part of the immunisation schedule. PCPs also expressed concerns regarding the efficacy of the vaccine as well as out-of-pocket costs incurred by families, and uncertainty regarding the mortality and morbidity of influenza in otherwise healthy children. However, they said they would recommend the vaccine to high-risk groups (e.g. children with chronic disease(s), and asthma).
   Conclusion: Despite the established safety of influenza vaccines, barriers to uptake include concerns regarding the iatrogenic effects of vaccination, its administration schedule, and knowledge of influenza severity. Updated information on influenza and the efficacy of the vaccine, and incorporating influenza vaccination into the immunisation schedule may overcome some of these barriers to increase influenza vaccination in this vulnerable cohort.

AB Background: Vaccination rates have remained steady for a number of years in Australia, however geographical areas of lower vaccine coverage remains a day-to-day challenge. The study explores parental attitudes, beliefs and intentions in relation to vaccination and examines the early effects of recent No Jab No Pay legislation.
   Methods: A national survey of was conducted, using an online questionnaire. Parents from all states in Australia with at least one child aged <6 years were invited to participate.
   Results: A total of 429 parents participated in the study. The substantial majority of participants reported having their youngest child's vaccination status up to date (n = 401, 93.5%). A child's vaccinations were more likely to be up to date if they had consulted a paediatrician in the previous 12-months (OR 5.01; 95%CI 1.05, 23.92; p = .043). Conversely they were less likely to be vaccinated if they were influenced by information from a complementary medicine (CM) practitioner (OR 0.03; 95%CI 0.01, 0.15; p< .001) or had visited a CM-practitioner (OR 0.09; 95%CI 0.02, 0.33; p < .001) in the previous 12-months. A total of 2.6% of parents had immunised their child as a result of the No Jab No Pay legislation, while 3.9% stated the legislation had no effect, and 1.2% said it had made them less likely to vaccinate. A further 1.2% of parents stated they are considering vaccination as a result of the legislative changes.
   Conclusion: Parents who have not vaccinated their children appear to trust non-mainstream sources of information such as CM-practitioners. Further research is required to determine how to manage the challenges and opportunities of CM-practitioners as a source of vaccine information. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Existing Influenza A virus (IAV) vaccines target variable parts of the virus that may change between seasons. Vaccine design relies on predicting the predominant circulating influenza strains but when there is a mismatch between vaccine and circulating strains, efficacy is sub-optimal. Furthermore, current approaches provide limited protection against emerging influenza strains that may cause pandemics. One solution is to design vaccines that target conserved protein domains of influenza, which remain largely unchanged over time and are likely to be found in emergent variants. We present a virus-like particle (VLP), built using the hepatitis B virus tandem core platform, as an IAV vaccine candidate containing multiple conserved antigens. Hepatitis B core protein spontaneously assembles into a VLP that is immunogenic and confers immunogenicity to proteins incorporated into the major insertion region (MIR) of core monomers. However, insertion of antigen sequences may disrupt particle assembly preventing VLP formation or result in unstable particles. We have overcome these problems by genetically manipulating the hepatitis B core to express core monomers in tandem, ligated with a flexible linker, incorporating different antigens at each of the MIRs. Immunisation with this VLP, named Tandiflu1, containing 4 conserved antigens from matrix protein 2 ectodomain and hemagglutinin stalk, leads to production of cross-reactive and protective antibodies. The polyclonal antibodies induced by Tandiflu1 can bind IAV Group 1 hemagglutinin types H1, H5, H11, H9, H16 and a conserved epitope on matrix protein 2 expressed by most strains of IAV. Vaccination with Tandiflul results in 100% protection from a lethal influenza challenge with H1N1 IAV. Serum transfer from vaccinated animals is sufficient to confer protection from influenza-associated illness in naive mice. These data suggest that a Tandem Core based IAV vaccine might provide broad protection against common and emergent H1 IAV strains responsible for seasonal and pandemic influenza in man.

AB Background: The originally recommended dosing schedule, 0, 2, 6 months, for the 3-dose quadrivalent human papillomavirus vaccine (4vHPV) was often not followed, resulting in longer than recommended intervals between doses and interest in the effect of prolonged intervals. Recent two-dose recommendations require investigations into the effect of delaying dose 2.
   Methods: This multi-site, prospective study enrolled healthy 9-17 year old girls (n = 1321) on the day of or within 28 days following a third dose of 4vHPV vaccination. Antibody titers to 4vHPV types were measured at one and six months post-dose 3 from all participants and post-dose 2 from participants who were on time for dose 3. To compare antibody responses, participants were categorized into groups: second and third doses on time (control group); on-time dose 2, substantially late dose 3 (group 2); substantially late dose 2, on-time dose 3 (group 3); both doses substantially late (group 4). Analyses compared age-adjusted geometric mean titers (GMTs) at one-month and six-months post-dose 3, effect of delaying the second dose, and two versus three doses as well as post-dose 2 GMTs, stratified by age.
   Results: Compared to on-time dosing, one-month post-dose 3 GMTs were non-inferior in groups 2, 3, and 4 and were superior in group 2. Six month post-dose 3 GMTs were superior in groups 2, 3, and 4 for each genotype, except HPV 18 in group 3. Age-adjusted post does 2 titers were significantly lower than post dose 3 titers when dose 2 was on time but were significantly higher when dose 2 was substantially late. Participants >= 15 years old had no difference in post-dose 2 titers compared to <15 year olds when dose 2 was substantially delayed.
   Conclusions: Prolonged intervals between doses do not appear to diminish and may enhance antibody response to 4vHPV. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Background: Influenza vaccination has been recommended for all persons aged >= 6 months since 2010.
   Methods: Data from the 2016 National Internet Flu Survey were analyzed to assess provider vaccination recommendations and early influenza vaccination during the 2016-17 season among adults aged >= 18 years. Predictive marginals from a multivariable logistic regression model were used to identify factors independently associated with early vaccine uptake by provider vaccination recommendation status.
   Results: Overall, 24.0% visited a provider who both recommended and offered influenza vaccination, 9.0% visited a provider who only recommended but did not offer, 25.1% visited a provider who neither recommended nor offered, and 41.9% did not visit a doctor from July 1 through date of interview. Adults who reported that a provider both recommended and offered vaccine had significantly higher vaccination coverage (66.6%) compared with those who reported that a provider only recommended but did not offer (48.4%), those who neither received recommendation nor offer (32.0%), and those who did not visit a doctor during the vaccination period (28.8%). Results of multivariable logistic regression indicated that having received a provider recommendation, with or without an offer for vaccination, was significantly associated with higher vaccination coverage after controlling for demographic and access-to-care factors.
   Conclusions: Provider recommendation was significantly associated with influenza vaccination. However, overall, 67.0% of adults did not visit a doctor during the vaccination period or did visit a doctor but did not receive a provider recommendation. Evidence-based strategies such as client reminder/recall, standing orders, provider reminders, or health systems interventions in combination should be undertaken to improve provider recommendation and influenza vaccination coverage. Other factors significantly associated with a higher level of influenza vaccination included age >= 50 years, being Hispanic, having a college or higher education, having a usual place for medical care, and having public health insurance.

AB Vaccine coverage of the general population in Luxembourg is high, but refugees or asylum seekers may be incompletely vaccinated and susceptible to vaccine-preventable diseases.
   In order to assess protection rates, serum and oral fluid samples were collected from 406 newcomers aged between 13 and 70 years arriving between May and September 2012. Sera were screened for IgG antibodies against measles, rubella, mumps, hepatitis B, tetanus, diphtheria and pertussis. Oral fluid samples were screened for antibodies against measles, mumps and rubella virus to investigate their suitability for antibody prevalence studies.
   More than 90% of the participants had IgG antibodies against rubella, 73% against measles and 56% against mumps. Less than 19% had anti-HBs antibodies. Nearly 84% of the participants had an adequate protection against tetanus, 73% against diphtheria and 40% had pertussis antibodies. 93%, 95% and 78% of the measles, rubella and mumps test results obtained with serum and oral fluid were concordant.
   The majority of the participants lacked antibodies against at least one of the measles/mumps/rubella (58%) and diphtheria/tetanus/pertussis (72%) vaccine components and against hepatitis B virus (82%) and might thus profit from vaccination. Oral fluid is a suitable alternative and non-invasive specimen for measles rubella antibody prevalence studies. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Ammonium oxidation to nitrite and then to nitrate (nitrification) is a key process in many waterworks treating groundwater to make it potable. In rapid sand filters, nitrifying microbial communities may evolve naturally from groundwater bacteria entering the filters. However, in new filters this may take several months, and in some cases the nitrification process is never sufficiently rapid to be efficient or is only performed partially, with nitrite as an undesired end product. The present study reports the first successful priming of nitrification in a rapid sand filter treating groundwater. It is shown that nitrifying communities could be enriched by microbiomes from well-functioning rapid sand filters in waterworks and that the enriched nitrifying consortium could be used to inoculate fresh filters, significantly shortening the time taken for the nitrification process to start. The key nitrifiers in the enrichment were different from those in the well-functioning filter, but similar to those that initiated the nitrification process in fresh filters without inoculation. Whether or not the nitrification was primed with the enriched nitrifying consortium, the bacteria performing the nitrification process during start-up appeared to be slowly outcompeted by Nitrospira, the dominant nitrifying bacterium in well functioning rapid sand filters.

AB The main objective of this project was to develop a steel slag filter effluent neutralization process by acidification with CO2-enriched air coming from a bioprocess. Sub-objectives were to evaluate the neutralization capacity of different configurations of neutralization units in lab-scale conditions and to propose a design model of steel slag effluent neutralization. Two lab-scale column neutralization units fed with two different types of influent were operated at hydraulic retention time of 10 h. Tested variables were mode of flow (saturated or percolating), type of media (none, gravel, Bionest and Anox-Kaldnes K3), type of air (ambient or CO2-enriched) and airflow rate. One neutralization field test (saturated and no media, 2000-5000 ppm CO2, sequential feeding, hydraulic retention time of 7.8 h) was conducted for 7 days. Lab-scale and field-scale tests resulted in effluent pH of 7.5-9.5 when the aeration rate was sufficiently high. A model was implemented in the PHREEQC software and was based on the carbonate system, CO2 transfer and calcite precipitation; and was calibrated on ambient air lab tests. The model was validated with CO2-enriched air lab and field tests, providing satisfactory validation results over a wide range of CO2 concentrations. The flow mode had a major impact on CO2 transfer and hydraulic efficiency, while the type of media had little influence. The flow mode also had a major impact on the calcite surface concentration in the reactor: it was constant in saturated mode and was increasing in percolating mode. Predictions could be made for different steel slag effluent pH and different operation conditions (hydraulic retention time, CO2 concentration, media and mode of flow). The pH of the steel slag filter effluent and the CO2 concentration of the enriched air were factors that influenced most the effluent pH of the neutralization process. An increased concentration in CO2 in the enriched air reduced calcite precipitation and clogging risks. Stoichiometric calculations showed that a typical domestic septic tank effluent with 300 mg/L of biodegradable COD provides enough biological CO2 for neutralization of a steel slag effluent with pH of 10.5-11.5. A saturated neutralization reactor with no media operated at hydraulic retention time of 10 h and a concentration of 2000 ppm in CO2 enriched air is recommended for full-scale applications.

AB Most of the knowledge on the occurrence of Uranium (U) in groundwater comes from in-situ manipulation experiments in the field, computational modelling studies or from laboratory analyses where individual processes of U mobilization were studied in isolation. Because of Uranium's vital redox chemistry it interacts, often simultaneously, with many other element cycles (e.g., sulfur, carbon, iron, and manganese) making it difficult to predict U concentrations in natural environments. For the present study a large data set was analyzed to predict the occurrence of U in groundwater from basic hydrochemistry. The data set consists of more than 8000 chemical groundwater analyses (including Uranium concentrations) from more than 2000 sampling locations.
   A strong relation between U concentrations and electric conductivity as well as alkalinity was observed, suggesting that weathering of geogenic source material and desorption from mineral surfaces is the principle mechanism of U release. Except for aquifers with strongly reducing conditions this process leads to a slow but continuous accumulation of U in groundwater in most cases. Importantly, the occurrence of U is modulated by the prevailing redox conditions in an aquifer. Uranium concentrations were moderate under oxic conditions and highest under manganese and nitrate-reducing conditions (heterotrophic as wells as autotrophic nitrate reduction). Only in iron- and sulfate-reducing groundwater the probability of U concentrations above 1 mu g l(-1) was virtually zero, as these ground waters act as U sinks.
   The combination of mineral weathering (especially carbonates) with mobilization of U under manganese and nitrate reducing conditions results in the highest risk of detecting U. In contrast, a low risk is associated with low pH (<7) and low mineralization of groundwater, which is the case in granitic catchments, for example. Our results further provide evidence, that agricultural practices such as liming, use of fertilizers and irrigation influence the occurrence of U in groundwater in multiple ways. Accurate management of aquifers underlying farmland will therefore become more and more important in the future. In summary, we find that the vulnerability of an aquifer to elevated U concentrations cannot be explained by a single factor. This complicates efforts to target elevated U concentrations in groundwaters that are abstracted for drinking water production. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB To assess the fate and long-term reactivity of bimetallic nanoparticles used in groundwater remediation, it is important to trace the physicochemical transformation of nanoparticles during aging in water. This study investigated the short-term (within 5 d) and long-term (up to 90 d) aging process of Fe/Ni bimetallic nanoparticles (Fe/Ni BNP5) in simulated groundwater and the consequent effect on the particle reactivity. Results indicate that the morphological, compositional and structural transformation of Fe/Ni BNPs happened during the aging. In the 5-d short-term aging, Fe-0 corrosion occurred rapidly and was transformed to ferrous ions which were adsorbed onto the surface of Fe/Ni BNPs, accompanied by the elevation of solution pH and the negative redox potential. In the long-term aging, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images show that the particles transformed from spherical to rod-like and further to sheet-like and needle-like. X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis reveals that the main aging product was magnetite (Fe3O4) and/or maghemite (gamma-Fe2O3) after aging for 60-90 d. Energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS) analysis demonstrates that the mass ratio of Fe/Ni increased with aging, revealing that Ni were possibly gradually entrapped and covered by the iron oxides. Besides, the release of Ni into solution was also detected during the aging. The reactivity of the aged Fe/Ni BNP5 was examined by studying its performance in tetracycline (TC) removal. The aged Fe/Ni BNPs within 2 d kept similar removal efficiency of TC as the fresh particles. However, the removal efficiency of TC by Fe/Ni BNPs aged for 5-15 d dropped by 20-50% due to aggregation and oxidation of particles, and the removal efficiency further decreased slowly with the prolongation of aging time up to 90 d. This reveals that Fe/Ni BNPs were vulnerable to passivation in water environments. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Lake water constituents, such as chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) and nitrate, absorb sunlight which induces an array of photochemical reactions. Although these reactions are a substantial driver of pollutant degradation in lakes they are insufficiently understood, in particular on large scales. Here, we provide for the first time comprehensive photochemical maps covering a large geographic region. Using photochemical kinetics modeling for 1048 lakes across Sweden we simulated the steady-state concentrations of four photoreactive transient species, which are continuously produced and consumed in sunlit lake waters. We then simulated the transient-induced photochemical transformation of organic pollutants, to gain insight into the relevance of the different photoreaction pathways. We found that boreal lakes were often unfavorable environments for photoreactions mediated by hydroxyl radicals (center dot OH) and carbonate radical anions (CO3-center dot), while photoreactions mediated by CDOM triplet states ((CDOM)-C-3*) and, to a lesser extent, singlet oxygen (O-1(2)) were the most prevalent. These conditions promote the photodegradation of phenols, which are used as plastic, medical drug and herbicide precursors. When CDOM concentrations increase, as is currently commonly the case in boreal areas such as Sweden, (CDOM)-C-3* will also increase, promoting its importance in photochemical pathways even more.

AB The herbicide bentazone is recalcitrant in aquifers and is therefore frequently detected in wells used for drinking water production. However, bentazone degradation has been observed in filter sand from a rapid sand filter at a waterworks with methane-rich groundwater. Here, the association between methane oxidation and removal of bentazone was investigated with a methanotrophic enrichment culture derived from methane-fed column reactors inoculated with that filter sand. Several independent lines of evidence obtained from microcosm experiments with the methanotrophic enrichment culture, tap water and bentazone at concentrations below 2 mg/L showed methanotrophic co-metabolic bentazone transformation: The culture removed 53% of the bentazone in 21 days in presence of 5 mg/L of methane, while only 31% was removed in absence of methane. Addition of acetylene inhibited methane oxidation and stopped bentazone removal. The presence of bentazone partly inhibited methane oxidation since the methane consumption rate was significantly lower at high (1 mg/L) than at low (1 mu g/L) bentazone concentrations. The transformation yield of methane relative to bentazone normalized by their concentration ratio ranged from 58 to 158, well within the range for methanotrophic co-metabolic degradation of trace contaminants calculated from the literature, with normalized substrate preferences varying from 3 to 400. High-resolution mass spectrometry revealed formation of the transformation products (TPs) 6-OH, 8-OH, isopropyl-OH and di-OH-bentazone, with higher abundances of all TPs in the presence of methane. Overall, we found a suite of evidence all showing that bentazone was co-metabolically transformed to hydroxy-bentazone by a methanotrophic culture enriched from a rapid sand filter at a waterworks.

AB The migration of arsenic (As) enriched groundwater into Pleistocene aquifers as a consequence of extensive groundwater abstraction represents an increasing threat to the precious water resources in Asian delta regions. Pleistocene aquifer sediments are typically rich in Felll-(hydr)oxides and are capable to adsorb high amounts of As. This results in a pronounced accumulation of As in Pleistocene aquifers, where high As groundwater infiltrates from adjacent Holocene aquifers. However, As retention by Pleistocene aquifers over long-term time scales remains largely unknown. We studied As sorption in situ by placing natural Pleistocene sediments and pure mineral phases directly inside groundwater monitoring wells at a study site near Hanoi (Vietnam). This in situ exposure allows for constant flushing of the samples with unaltered groundwater and the establishment of undisturbed sorption equilibria similar to those in local aquifer sediments, which is not readily attainable in traditional laboratory sorption experiments. The groundwaters in our experimental wells were characterized by different As concentrations (0.01-6.63 mu mol/L) and redox states, reaching from suboxic to anoxic conditions (E-h of +159 to -4 mV). Results show that adsorption is the dominant As retention mechanism, independent from the respective groundwater chemistry (i.e. concentrations of dissolved P, HCO3- and Si). Whilst most of the As sorbed within the first week, sorption further increased slowly but consistently by 6-189%, respectively, within six months. Hence, the As sorption behavior of Pleistocene aquifer sediments should be determined over longer periods to avoid an underestimation of the As sorption capacity. Accompanying desorption experiments revealed that about 51% of the sorbed As was remobilized within six months when exposed to low As groundwater. We therefore conclude that a considerable proportion of the As accumulated in the aquifer sediments is prone to remobilization once the As concentrations in migrating groundwater decline. Remobilization of As should be considered in local water management plans to avoid contamination of precious groundwater resources with this As legacy. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The intensive use of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) in cosmetics and textiles causes their release into sewer networks of urban water systems. Although a few studies have investigated antimicrobial activities of nanoparticles against environmental bacteria, little is known about potential impacts of the released AgNPs on sulfate reducing bacteria in sewers. Here, we investigated the effect of AgNPs on Desulfovibrio vulgaris Hidenborough (D. vulgaris), a typical sulfate-reducing bacterium (SRB) in sewer systems. We found AgNPs stimulated the proliferation of D. vulgaris, rather than exerting inhibitory or biocidal effects. Based on flow cytometer detections, both the cell growth rate and the viable cell ratio of D. vulgaris increased during exposure to AgNPs at concentrations of up to 100 mg/L. The growth stimulation was dependent on the AgNP concentration. These results imply that the presence of AgNPs in sewage may affect SRB abundance in sewer networks. Our findings also shed new lights on the interactions of nanoparticles and bacteria. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Many wastewater treatment technologies have been shown to remove bacterial pathogens more effectively than viral pathogens and, in aquatic environments, levels of traditional faecal indicator bacteria (FIB) do not appear to correlate consistently with levels of human viral pathogens. There is, therefore, a need for novel viral indicators of faecal pollution and surrogates of viral pathogens, especially given the increasing importance of indirect and direct wastewater reuse. Potential candidates include bacterio-phages (phages) and the study described here sought to elucidate the relationship between three groups of phages (somatic coliphages (SOMPH), F-RNA coliphages (F-RNAPH) and human-specific phages infecting B. fragilis (Bf124PH) - enumeration using double layer agar technique) and viral pathogens (human adenovirus (HuAdV) and norovirus (NoV) - enumeration using molecular methods) through full-scale municipal wastewater treatment processes. FIB (faecal coliforms (FC) and intestinal enterococci (ENT) - enumeration using membrane filtration) were also monitored. Samples were collected every fortnight, during a twelve-month period, at each stage of four full-scale wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) in southern England (two activated sludge (AS) and two trickling filter (TF) plants) (n = 360 samples). FIB and SOMPH were consistently found in all samples tested, whereas F-RNAPH, Bf124PH and HuAdV were less frequently detected, especially following AS treatment. The detection rate of NoV was low and consequently discussion of this group of viruses is limited. Concentrations of SOMPH and FIB were statistically higher (p value < 0.05) than concentrations of F-RNAPH, Bf124PH and HuAdV in raw wastewater. FIB were more effectively removed than phages in both systems. Removal rates of HuAdV were similar to those of phages at the secondary treatment stage of both systems. In TF systems, HuAdV were removed at the same rate as F-RNAPH, but at lower rates than SOMPH and Bf124PH. The findings suggest that phages (in particular SOMPH) are better indicators of the fate of viral pathogens in WWTP than existing FIB and that these organisms may have a useful role to play in future sanitation safety planning.

AB This study examines the feasibility of a novel nanofiltration membrane bioreactor (NF-MBR) followed by reverse osmosis (RO) process for water reclamation at 90% recovery and using an ultrafiltration MBR (UF-MBR)+RO as baseline for comparison. Both MBRs adopted the same external hollow fiber membrane configurations and operating conditions. The collected permeates of the MBRs were subsequently fed to the respective RO systems. The results showed that the NF-MBR (operated at a constant flux of 10 L/m(2)h) achieved superior MBR permeate quality due to enhanced biodegradation and high rejection capacity of the NF membrane, leading to lower RO fouling rates (similar to 33 times) as compared to the UF-MBR. Further analysis indicated that the cake layer fouling that caused the cake-enhanced osmotic pressure (CEOP) effect contributed predominantly to the transmembrane pressure (TMP) increase in the NF-MBR, while irreversible pore fouling was the major reason for OF membrane fouling. Furthermore, it was found that the biopolymers (i.e., organics with MW > 10 kDa) were the main components present in the foulants of the NF/UF membranes and RO membranes. The analysis indicated that the NF-MBR RO system at recovery of 90% has comparable energy consumption as the UF-MBR RO system at recovery of 75%. Our findings proved the feasibility of the NF-MBR RO for water reclamation at a high recovery rate. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Natural organic matter (NOM) is ubiquitous in aqueous systems and dynamically partitions onto/from environmental surfaces. However, such interfacial processes have not been uniformly quantified in situ and in real time. In this work, adsorption and deposition processes of Suwannee River humic acid (SRHA) and Suwannee River fulvic acid (SRFA), as model NOM, were evaluated for a series of environmentally relevant interfaces. Real-time, interfacial phenomenon, including deposition, release, and adlayer viscoelastic properties, were quantified over a variety of water chemistries via quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring (QCM-D). Specifically, adlayer mass and deposition rates of SRHA and SRFA were evaluated as a function of NOM concentration/molecular weight (fraction), pH, electrolyte composition (type and concentration), and collector surface type. For these, the adsorption of SRHA onto aluminum oxide (Al2O3) and polystyrene (PS) surfaces follows the Langmuir isotherm model. Rapid, near-monolayer formation of SRHA/SRFA adlayers were observed on Al2O3, hydroxyapatite (HAP), and poly (L-lysine) (PLL) surfaces, but not on PS or iron oxide (Fe3O4) surfaces. The presence of divalent cations (Ca2+/Mg2+) at relatively low concentrations (0.5-5.0 mM) significantly enhances the mass of SRHA/SRFA deposited onto the surfaces of silica (SiO2), Al2O3, and PS. Viscoelastic properties of the adsorbed layer based on the ratio of dissipation to frequency revealed a relatively unique adlayer structure for SRHA in the presence of 5.0 mM Ca2+.

AB It is possible to distribute drinking water without a disinfectant residual when the treated water is biologically stable. The objective of this study was to determine the impact of easily and slowly biodegradable compounds on the biostability of the drinking water at three full-scale production plants which use the same surface water, and on the regrowth conditions in the related distribution systems. Easily biodegradable compounds in the drinkirig water were determined with AOC-P17/Nox during 2012-2015. Slowly biodegradable organic compounds measured as particulate and/or high-molecular organic carbon (PHMOC), were monitored at the inlet and after the different treatment stages of the three treatments during the same period. The results show that PHMOC (300-470 mu g C L-1) was approximately 10% of the TOC in the surface water and was removed to 50-100 mu g C L-1. The PHMOC in the water consisted of 40-60% of carbohydrates and 10% of proteins. A significant and strong positive correlation was observed for PHMOC concentrations and two recently introduced bioassay methods for slowly biodegradable compounds (AOC-A3 and biomass production potential, BPC14). Moreover, these three parameters in the biological active carbon effluent (BACF) of the three plants showed a positive correlation with regrowth in the drinking water distribution system, which was assessed with Aeromonas, heterotrophic plate counts, coliforms and large invertebrates. In contrast, the AOC-P17/Nox concentrations did not correlate with these regrowth parameters. We therefore conclude that slowly biodegradable compounds in the treated water from these treatment plants seem to have a greater impact on regrowth in the distribution system than easily biodegradable compounds.

AB This paper introduces a new mathematical model built under the PC-PWM methodology to describe the aeration process in a full-scale WWTP. This methodology enables a systematic and rigorous incorporation of chemical and physico-chemical transformations into biochemical process models, particularly for the description of liquid-gas transfer to describe the aeration process. The mathematical model constructed is able to reproduce biological COD and nitrogen removal, liquid-gas transfer and chemical reactions. The capability of the model to describe the liquid-gas mass transfer has been tested by comparing simulated and experimental results in a full-scale WWTP. Finally, an exploration by simulation has been undertaken to show the potential of the mathematical model. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB We used Ames assays to investigate the effects of ozonation (designated O-3), ozonation followed by chlorination (O-3/Cl), an advanced oxidation process (AOP, UV/H2O2), and AOP followed by chlorination (AOP/Cl) on the mutagenicity of solutions of 3-methy1-4-nitrophenol (3M4NP), a major environmental degradation product of the organopliosphorus insecticide fenitrothion. Whereas O-3 did not induce mutagenicity, O-3/Cl, AOP, and AOP/Cl converted 3M4NP into mutagenic transformation products (TPs). Using liquid chromatography mass spectrometry, we detected a total of 138 peaks in the solutions subjected to O-3/Cl, AOP, and AOP/Cl. To elucidate the TPs responsible for the observed mutagenicity, we performed simple regression analyses of the relationship between the area of each peak and the observed mutagenicity of samples withdrawn periodically during each oxidation process. The area of each of 10 peaks was found to be positively correlated (r(2) >= 0.8) with the observed mutagenicity, suggesting that the TPs corresponding to these peaks contributed to the mutagenicity. After taking into account the consistency of mutagenicity induction by the oxidation processes and analyzing the peaks by tandem mass spectrometry, we identified 3 TPs, corresponding to 6 peaks, as candidate mutagens. These TPs were assessed by means of 4 quantitative structure activity relationship (QSAR) models, and all 3 were predicted to be mutagenic by at least one model. This result was consistent with our assumption that these TPs were mutagens. Ames assays of an authentic sample of one of the 3 TPs revealed that it did not contribute to the mutagenicity. This left 3-methoxy-4-nitrophenol and 2-[(E)-[(2,5-dihydroxyphenyl) methylidene]amino]-5-dihydroxybenzaldehyde on the list of mutagens suspected of contributing to the mutagenicity induced by AOP. No TPs were identified as candidate mutagens responsible for the mutagenicity induced by O-3/Cl and AOP/Cl. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In order to optimize drinking water production operation, membrane users can use several analytical tools that help membrane fouling prediction and alleviate fouling by a proper feed water resource selection. However, during strong fouling event, membrane decision-makers still face short-term deadline to decide between different options (e.g. optimization of pretreatment or change in feed water quality). Hence, statistical approach might help to better select the most relevant analytical parameter related to fouling potential of a specific resource in order to speed-up decision taking. In this study, the physical and chemical properties and the filtration performances (at lab-scale) of five ground water resources, selected as potential resources of a large drinking production site of Paris (France), was evaluated through one year. Principal component analysis emphasizes the strong link between waters' organic matrix and fouling propensity. Cluster analysis of filtration performances allowed classifying the water samples into three groups exhibiting strong, low and intermediate fouling. Finally, multiple linear regressions performed on all collected data indicated that strong fouling events were related to a combined increase of carbon content and protein like-substances while intermediate fouling might only be anticipated by an increase of fluorescence signal associated to protein like-substances. This study demonstrates that advanced data analysis might be a powerful tool to better manage water resources selection used for drinking water production and to forecast filtration performances in a context of water quality degradation.

AB Anaerobic digestion of biowaste not only reduces environmental burden but also plays an important role for sustainable energy supply. For process optimization simulation based on the Anaerobic Digestion Model No.1 (ADM1) is commonly used.
   The ADM1 was extended to include the known three genera of propionate oxidizing bacteria (POB) and the two routes of propionate degradation (methyl-malonyl CoA and C6-dismutation pathway). Kinetic parameters for anaerobic propionate oxidation by single strains of the three propionate oxidizing genera were determined from defined tri-cultures of the POB with hydrogenotrophic and acetotrophic methanogens and implemented into ADM1. The such improved model ADM1xpro was evaluated with operational data from a full scale wet biowaste digestion plant. Predicted amounts of biogas and composition with ADM1xpro (2201 m(3) (d(-1), 68.1 % CH4 and 31.9 % CO2) correlated well with full-scale process data (2171 m(3) d(-1,) 67.5 % CH4 and 31.9 % CO2).

AB Significant progress has been made over recent years in capacitive deionization (CDI) to develop novel system configurations, predictive theoretical models, and high-performance electrode materials. To bring CDI to large scale practical applications, it is important to quantitatively understand the intrinsic tradeoff between kinetic and energetic efficiencies, or the relationship between energy consumption and the mass transfer rate. In this study, we employed both experimental and modeling approaches to systematically investigate the tradeoff between kinetic and energetic efficiencies in membrane CDI (MCDI). Specifically, we assessed the relationship between the average salt adsorption rate and specific energy consumptions from MCDI experiments with different applied current densities but a constant effluent salinity. We investigated the impacts of feed salinity, diluted water salinity, diluted water volume per charging cycle, and electrode materials on the kinetics-energetics tradeoff. We also demonstrate how this tradeoff can be employed to optimize the design and operation of CDI systems and compare the performance of different electrode materials and CDI systems.

AB Extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) are an important parameter in drinking-water biofilters, and, to date, this is the first study to compare protocols from the literature for extracting EPS from granular filter media. Five extraction protocols were compared, and one was improved by varying the type of initial physical treatment and the shaking intensity, temperature, and time of incubation. Extracting EPS from granular filter media in triplicate by combining 2 g (wet weight) of filter media with 10 mL of extraction buffer (10 mM Tris, 10 mM EDTA, 2.5% NaCl, pH 8), vortexing for 1 min, and incubating for 4 h at 35 degrees C with shaking at 200 rpm yielded significantly higher EPS polysaccharide and/or protein concentrations than did protocols from the literature. This improved protocol extracted a significant fraction of the biofilm attached to sand but was less effective on biofilm attached to anthracite or granular activated carbon (GAC). A survey of 11 full-scale biofilters from the U.S. and Canada revealed that EPS polysaccharide and protein concentrations can vary over one order of magnitude, from 0.02 to 0.60 mg glucose/g total solids (TS) and 0.27 to 3.38 mg bovine serum albumin/g TS, respectively. Backwashing significantly lowered the biomass and EPS polysaccharide concentrations, but the majority of the biofilm remained attached to the filter media after bacicwashing, as expected. The fraction of EPS polysaccharides and proteins removed during backwashing did not differ between anthracite and GAC biofilters. The improved EPS extraction protocol can be utilized to investigate the role of EPS in biofilter performance. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Switch of source water may induce "red water" episodes. This study investigated the impacts of water quality on iron release, dissolved oxygen consumption (ADO), corrosion scale evolution and bacterial community succession in cast iron pipes used for drinking water distribution at pilot scale, and proposed a source water switch strategy accordingly. Three sets of old cast iron pipe section (named BP, SP and GP) were excavated on site and assembled in a test base, which had historically transported blended water, surface water and groundwater, respectively. Results indicate that an increasing Cl- or SO42- concentration accelerated iron release, but alkalinity and calcium hardness exhibited an opposite tendency. Disinfectant shift from free chlorine to monochloramine slightly inhibited iron release, while the impact of peroxymonosulfate depended on the source water historically transported in the test pipes. The ADO was highly consistent with iron release in all three pipe systems. The mass ratio of magnetite to goethite in the corrosion scales of SP was higher than those of BP and GP and kept almost unchanged over the whole operation period. Siderite and calcite formation confirmed that an increasing alkalinity and hardness inhibited iron release. Iron-reducing bacteria decreased in the BP but increased in the SP and GP; meanwhile, sulfur-oxidizing, sulfate-reducing and iron oxidizing bacteria increased in all three pipe systems. To avoid the occurrence of "red water", a source water switch strategy was proposed based on the difference between local and foreign water qualities. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB California has one of the largest systems of surface water reservoirs in the world, providing irrigation water to California's agriculturally productive Central Valley. Irrigation water is recognized as a vehicle for the microbial contamination of raw produce and must be monitored according to new federal regulation. The purpose of this study was to further understanding of the variability of fecal indicator bacteria (Escherichia coli and fecal coliforms) and pathogens (E. coli O157:147 (O157), non-O157 Shiga toxin-producing E. coli (STEC) and Salmonella) along both horizontal and vertical profiles within California reservoirs. Monthly sampling was conducted in six reservoirs located in the foothills of the Western Sierra Nevada during the summer irrigation season and extreme drought conditions of 2014 (n = 257). Concentrations of fecal indicator bacteria were highly variable between reservoirs (p < 0.05) and along the horizontal profile (p < 0.001) from upstream to downstream, with higher concentrations typically found outside of the reservoirs than within. Though many of the reservoirs were thermally stratified, bacterial concentrations were not associated with water temperature (p > 0.05) or any one particular depth strata (p < 0.05). However, prevalence of Salmonella and STEC (16/70 and 9/70 respectively) was higher in the deep strata than in mid or surface layers. We found no statistical association between samples collected downstream of reservoirs and those from the reservoirs themselves. Continued monitoring and modeling of both bacterial indicators and enteric pathogens are critical to our ability to estimate the risk of surface irrigation water supplies and make appropriate management decisions.

AB In the present study, snO(2) nanoparticles were successfully synthesized by chemical precipitation method using anhydrous aspartic acid and surfactant at two annealing temperatures, 300 degrees C and 600 degrees C. The effect of surfactants cationic CTAB and anionic SDS on the synthesized SnO2 nanoparticles (NPs) were studied elaborately. In this article, for the first time, SnO2 NPs were employed as an excellent photo catalyst in the degradation of carbamazepine (CBZ), a popular antiepileptic drug which is most commonly detected pharmaceutically active compounds (PhACs) in municipal wastewater under UV-C light irradiation. Comparative studies between the photocatalytic activity of SnO2 NPs synthesized with CTAB (SC1) and SDS (SS1) on the degradation of the CBZ drug were investigated. Parameters like the effect of catalytic loading, initial concentration, pH and contact time were also studied for optimization. The results indicate that SC1 is a better photocatalyst with rate constant 6.66 x 10(-2) min(-1) than SS1 with rate 5.7 x 10(-2) min(-1). To determine the transformation product formed on the photodegradation LCMS (ESI) analysis was done. The synthesized SnO2 NPs can be recycled up to 8th cycles without any notable alteration in its photocatalytic activity. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Glasses with a general formula (0.9-x)NaPO3-xSiO(2)-0.1ZnO (0 <= x <= 0.1 mol) have been prepared using the conventional melt-quenching technique. Samples were investigated by means of X-ray diffraction, density evolutions, refractive index measurements (n), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), Fourier-transformed infrared (FTIR), Raman and UV-Visible spectroscopy.
   The variations of density and refractive index of the glass series were attributed to the structural changes of the glass network resulting from the incorporation of SiO2.
   The increase in glass transition temperature (T-g) values reflects an increase of the rigidity of the glass network when SiO2 is gradually introduced. These results were correlated with FTIR and Raman investigations which revealed the enhancement of the vitreous network when P-O-P bonds were replaced by P-O-Si.
   The variation of the optical band gap (E-opt) of the amorphous materials indicated an increase in the band gap energy with the glass composition. This behavior can be explained by the increase of number of non-bridging oxygen (NBOs) which is probably due to the depolymerization of phosphate chains.

AB The differentiation between the behavior of Zn2+ and Na+ cations in silicate network is shaded by the lack of characteristic infrared or Raman bands belonging to the modes involving the zinc- or sodium-oxygen bonds. It was shown in this study that the stepwise substitution of Na2O for ZnO in the xZnO-yNa(2)O-(1-x-y)SiO2 glasses with keeping approximately the same SiO2 content causes the high-frequency shift of the Raman-active boson peak (BP) that is the decrease of the correlation length in structural glass heterogeneities. Intercomparison of this trend with variations of the measured structural strength and microhardness of the glasses under consideration afforded ground to suggestion of a possible dual role of Zn2+ ion as either glass-modifier or glass former in specific compositions of zinc-alkali-silicate glasses.

ID CHALCOGENIDE GLASS; TEMPERATURE; TRANSITION
AB We have investigated compositional dependences of crystallization events of Ge-Sb-Se glasses across the compositional range appropriate for molded lens applications in the long-wavelength infrared spectrum. The onset temperature of crystallization turned out to feature no significant dependence on compositional changes of the constituent atoms, unlike glass transition temperature, Vickers hardness and thermal expansion coefficient, all of which revealed a much more significant correlation against germanium or selenium content. In an effort to unveil glass-structural attributes to the observed onset temperature of crystallization values, both mean coordination number and average bond energy were taken into consideration: The onset temperature of crystallization values appeared to be linearly proportional to average bond energy, whereas no such a correlation was verified in the case of mean coordination number. We delineated these behaviors, with an emphasis paid to the off-stoichiometry of each glass composition, in terms of network connectivity and chemical bond energy of the glass structure. In addition, crystalline phases precipitated during the bulk crystallization were identified, and the effects of the surface crystallization were analyzed in connection with infrared transmittance and hardness.

AB Ab initio simulations within a generalized gradient approximation are carried out to investigate the densification mechanism of amorphous zinc oxide (a-ZnO) under hydrostatic pressure. In contrast to the crystalline ZnO, the densification of a-ZnO is found to proceed gradually and is associated with a structural modification from a low density amorphous state to a high density amorphous state. Accompanied by the phase transformation, the mean coordination number increases from similar to 4.0 to similar to 5.5. The high-density amorphous form of ZnO has a local structure, partially comparable with that of the rocksalt type ZnO crystal and presents a semiconducting behavior. The phase change is irreversible because upon pressure release, an amorphous model largely consisting of fivefold coordination is recovered. The decompressed model can be, therefore, classified as an intermediate phase between the wurtzite-like and the rocksalt-like amorphous configurations.

AB The application of OMCTS/H-2/O-2 combustion process for the fused silica glass synthesis can prevent the halide emission compared to the conventional SiCl4/H-2/O-2 system. Detailed chemical kinetics of OMCTS/H-2/O-2 is critical for the prediction of flame characteristics, vapor nucleation, particle growth and deposition in the synthesis process. In this work, a detailed OMCTS/H-2/O-2 mechanism consisting of 55 species and 239 elementary reactions is formulated, which accounts for the oxidation, pyrolysis and hydrolysis of OMCTS, the combustion processes of H-2/O-2 and low hydrocarbon intermediate species. The dominant reaction pathways at representative thermo-chemical conditions for the fused silica glass synthesis are further analyzed through the directed relation graph method and a reduced mechanism of 24 species and 39 reactions is developed. The fused silica glass synthesis processes with OMCTS/H-2/O-2 and SiCl4/H-2/O-2 are then simulated respectively with the proposed mechanisms to reveal the differences in the flame, radicals and SiO2 formation characteristics. It is shown that although the two systems yield similar flame characteristics such as temperature and OH distributions, the SiO2 formation characteristics is different. The OMCTS/H-2/O-2 system has significant larger SiO2 concentration and a wider spread of SiO2 near the silica glass ingot and consequently a higher SiO2 formation rate. It is also shown that one new peak appears in the SiO distribution between the nozzle and SiO2 peak because the OMCTS pyrolysis process is important and it yields a larger amount of SiO. The effects of hydrogen inflow mass flow rate on the flame and SiO2 formation characteristics in the OMCTS/H-2/O-2 system are also analyzed.

The obtained glasses were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), FTIR and Mossbauer Effect (ME) spectra. Both of XRD and ME showed that all samples of x < 15 had formed pure glass phases, while the sample of x = 15 exhibited crystalline phase embedded in an amorphous structure. DC activation energy was observed to increase as Bi content increase. Cole-Cole parameters referred to a distribution of the relaxation time. The refractive index as the Bi ion was increased.

AB The Zr55Ni5Al10Cu32 alloy was prepared by copper-mold casting method. The microstructure of the alloy was examined by integrating the X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscope and electron probe microanalyzer. It was found that the alloy cast in the mold with 3 mm in diameter contains amorphous and Cu10Zr7 phases, while the alloys cast in the mold with 6 (D6) and 10 mm in diameter consist of Cu10Zr7, CuZr2 crystalline and amorphous phases. The quasi-static experiment result shows that the compressive fracture strength of D6 is up to 1560 MPa. Moreover, it was found that the Zr55Ni5Al10Cu30 alloy burned completely in air based on the evolution of bright spark during ballistic impact testing. The obviously reaming effect to impact target indicates that the Zr55Ni5Al10Cu30 alloy has a promising application in reactive material.

AB In this work, gamma radiation shielding parameters for six titanate bismuth borotellurite glasses were investigated. The mass attenuation coefficients (mu/rho) have been calculated using XCOM software and MCNP5 code within the photon energy range 0.015-10 MeV. The (mu/rho) values were then used to calculate the effective atomic number (Z(eff)), electron density (N-e), mean free path (MFP) and half-value layer (HVL) values. By using the Geometric progression (G-P) method, the exposure buildup factor (EBF) values at 0.015 MeV-15 MeV photon energy range, with penetration depths up to 40 mfp at intervals 1, 5, 10, 20, 30, and 40 mfp were evaluated. The 30 TeO2-30 B2O3-30 Bi2O3-10 TiO2 (mol %) glass possesses better gamma ray shielding effectiveness due to a higher value of (mu/rho), Z(eff) and lower values of HVL and MFP. The studied glasses exhibit excellent gamma ray shielding features compared to different types of concretes.

AB Annealing regulation plays an important role in improving the mechanical and dynamic properties of bulk metallic glass (BMG), but the influence of annealing on the tribological properties of Zr-based BMG hasn't been investigated. In this study, we comparably investigated the tribological properties of the Zr-based BMG (Zr61Ti2Cu25Al12) under different annealing degrees. The result shows that the anti-friction property of the BMG weakens with the increase of the annealing degree, but their anti-wear property presents an opposite trend. This study makes a contribution to understanding the relationship between the annealing degree and tribological properties, which means the BMG can be further optimized for the application of tribology by annealing regulation.

AB The superlattice-like (SLL) GaSb/Ge2Te multilayer thin films were proposed for multilevel ultralong-retention phase-change memory (PCM). Multiple resistance states can be achieved by tuning the thickness ratio between GaSb and Ge2Te layers. The intermediate resistance state could be maintained at a large temperature gap over a wide range from 270 to 355 degrees C, which guarantee the substantial reliability of the multilevel storage. The high crystallization temperature and 10-years data-retention temperature indicate the high thermal stability of the GaSb/Ge2Te films. After crystallization, the density of the GaSb/Ge2Te multilayer thin films increased slightly. It is in favor of the high reliability for the multilevel PCM. The two crystallization processes and three resistance states support a multilevel storage in the GaSb/Ge2Te-based test cell. The multiple resistance states originate from the localization of the electronic states, which result from the disorder as a result of doping element migrating from neighbor layer. The minimum energy necessary for RESET operation of GaSb/Ge2Te (3.7 x 10(-11) J) is lower than that of Ge2Sb2Te5 (8.1 x 10(-10) J) cell. GaSb/Ge2Te-based cell exhibited lower power consumption, high thermal stability and fast switching speed, suggesting GaSb/Ge2Te being one of the potential materials for multilevel PCM.

Using classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, the present work aims to discover the general GFA-related features in Fe-based liquids by the addition of large metallic (Ni) and small non-metallic (P) elements, respectively, into pure Fe melts. Simulation results demonstrate the better GFA of both the Fe80Ni20 and Fe20P20 liquids than that of pure Fe. Compared with pure Fe liquid, in both Fe80Ni20 and Fe20P20 glass-forming liquids, more < 0, 0, 12, 0 >, < 0, 1, 10, 3 > and < 0, 1, 10, 2 > icosahedron-like clusters with slow dynamics form rapidly during cooling, accompanied with depressing < 0, 3, 6, 4 >, < 0, 3, 6, 5 >, < 0, 2, 8, 4 > and < 0, 4, 4, 6 > bcc-like clusters with faster dynamics. Also, the dynamic heterogeneity of Fe80Ni20 and Fe80P20 liquids experiences a more dramatic increase before glass transition. These findings reveal the general structural and dynamic characteristics in Fe-based glass-forming liquids beneficial to GFA and shed light on how to enhance GFA from the structural and dynamic origin.

AB Highly crystallinity transparent glass-ceramics based on MgO-Al2O3-SiO2-P2O5 system have been prepared by conventional melt-quenching and "two-step" crystallization method. The crystallization kinetics, phase evolution, structure, physical and light transmittance properties of glass-ceramics were studied. The results reveal that the crystallization mechanism of this glass is believed to be three-dimensional interfacial growth. The predominant crystalline phase is Mg2Al4Si5O18 in these glass-ceramics, and the content of crystalline phase becomes higher with rising of crystallization temperature and time, which the light transmittance of glass-ceramics decreases. It is observed that the main elements are uniformly distributed in glass-ceramics from EDS element distribution maps. All things considered, the optimal heat treatment schedule of parent glass is 840 degrees C/36 h + 1050 degrees C/3 h, the prepared glass-ceramics possesses high crystallinity (90.5 vol%), good light transmittance (85%) and excellent mechanical and thermal properties. These findings make this family of transparent glass ceramics showing potential applications in solid-state optical functional material.

AB Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations have been widely used to study the structure of metallic glasses (MGs) at atomic scale. However, ultrafast cooling rates in MD simulations create structures that are substantially under relaxed. In this study, we introduce long-term pressurized annealing up to 1 mu s slightly below the glass-transition temperature, T-g, in MD simulation, which effectively relaxes the structure of Cu64Zr36 MG toward experimental conditions. It is found that applying hydrostatic pressure up to 2 GPa relaxes the MG to low-energy states whereas higher pressures retard relaxation events. In the sample annealed at 2 GPa pressure, equivalent cooling rate reaches to 3.7 x 10(7) K/s, which is in the order of melt spinning experiments. Furthermore, the correlation between structural relaxation and medium-range structures formed by interpenetrating connection of icosahedra is studied. Clustering coefficient analysis shows that in the samples prepared at high cooling rates, interpenetrating icosahedral networks are fragmented. However, as the glass relaxes toward real conditions, a unified network develops throughout the glassy structure, which acts as a solid-like backbone. The morphology of such a network differs from string-like fashion proposed in the previous studies.

AB The temperature dependence of initial permeability (mu(i)-T), the average grain size (D), the Curie temperature of amorphous phase (T-c(am)) of a series of annealed (Fe0.5Co0.5)(73.5)Nb3Si13.5Cu1B9-xAlx = 0, 1, 2, 3) alloys were investigated. The Curie temperature of amorphous phase (T-c(am)) for the Al-contained alloys decreased compared with the Al-free alloy, but the high-temperature magnetic softness was improved. It was found that the increasing Al content enlarged the interval temperature (Delta T-x) between the onset crystallization temperature (T-x1) and the secondary crystallization temperature (T-x2). The mu(i) of 530 degrees C vacuum annealed samples tended to increase both at room temperature (except for x = 3 alloy) and elevated temperature when Al replaced B element. The (Fe0.5Co0.5)(73.5)Nb3Si13.5Cu1B6Al3 alloy exhibited excellent high-temperature magnetic softness, and its higher mu(i) above 1000 can be maintained up to 670 degrees C.

AB Fe66.3B16.6Y17.1 amorphous structures designed based on a competitive atomic cluster model shows excellent catalytic ability due to the competition between two different Fe-rich clusters Fe11Y3 and Fe8B2. In this work, it was demonstrated that the minor elements play a key role in the catalytic behaviors by changing the local structure around Fe. Fe66.3B16.6Y17.1 based on Fe11Y3 and Fe8B2 clusters achieves the decolourization efficiency up to 99.2% on the azo dye Orange G (OG). The replacement of Fe11Y3 cluster by Fe11Zr3 or Fe11Nb3 leads to significantly deteriorated efficiencies of 13.2% for Fe66.3Br16.6Zr17.1 and 10.4% for Fe66.3B16.6Nb17.1 at identical testing conditions. The analysis on their local structures and the bonding states of Fe revealed that the weak interactions between atoms in these structures are related to the decolourization ability and catalytic effect directly. X-ray photoelectron spectra show that the jj coupling in the Fe 2p(5)3d(7) final state is a good predictor for the decolourization ability and catalytic effect of these Fe-rich amorphous structures.

AB The peculiarities of photoelastic and acousto-optic effects are first tested in chalcohalide 65GeS(2)-25Ga(2)S(3).10CsCl glass exploring the interferometry method. The determined piezo-optic coefficients occur to be (in Br) pi(11) = 2.8 +/- 0.6, pi(12) = 6.0 +/- 0.9 and pi(44) = -3.2 +/- 1.1. In respect to maximal acousto-optic figure of merit M-2 = 55.6.10(-15) s(3)/kg proper for longitudinal acoustic wave propagation and polarization along X-2 (i = 2) direction, this glass seems more perspective for photoelastic and acousto-optic modulation in visible and near IR ranges, than many alternative candidates, such as crystalline quartz, LiNbO3, CaWO4, PbMoO4, beta-BaB2O4, etc. For the first time it has been shown that piezo-optic effect of isotropic solids is anisotropic, and the degree of anisotropy is the difference of pi(11)-pi(12) coefficients.

AB To observe and regulate the surroundings of Nd3+ in silica glass, Nd3+-doped quartz-based composite glass was successfully prepared by the mixing and high-temperature sintering of 95 mol% SiO2 powder with 5 mol% Nd3+:Al(PO3)(3) glass powder. The spectroscopic properties of the composite glass were studied. The results showed that the emission peak wavelengths of Nd3+ were closer to that of the phosphate glass than of quartz glass, although the proportion of silica was much higher than that of phosphate. In order to determine the coordination environment of Nd3+ in the composite glass, the Judd-Ofelt intensity parameters were calculated and the electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectra were measured. The results indicated that Nd3+ interacted strongly with P5+, which led to a better dispersion. of Nd-3 + in the composite glass. Finally, structural analyses of the glasses were performed through Raman and infrared spectroscopy. Based on these results, we concluded that the coordination environment around Nd3+ could be effectively regulated by our proposed multistep preparation method.

AB Lanthanum oxide-strontium titanate-borosilicate glasses with increasing content of La2O3 were prepared by the melt quench technique. X-ray diffraction results revealed the amorphous nature of the prepared samples which indicated the formation of glass. In order to study the structure of various glass samples, density and molar volume were calculated at room temperature by using Archimedes principle. Structural and optical properties were studied by employing infrared spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy and UV-vis spectroscopy techniques. Direct and indirect optical band gap values were evaluated from Davis and Motts plots. The maximum and minimum optical band gap was found to be 3.54 and 3.46 eV. Urbach energy (Eu), steepness parameter (a), skin depth (8) and electron phonon interaction (Ee.p) were also studied. The calculated values of Eu were found to be increased from 0.30 to 0.33 eV with increasing the concentration of La2O3. Cytotoxicity of the synthesized glass samples was also performed. MTT assay was also performed to check the cell viability of the synthesized glass samples. These results revealed that the lower concentrations 1 tg/ml and 5 mu g/ml of the glass sample STB9L are found to be safe for biological applications.

AB MgO-Al2O3-SiO2-TiO2 glass-ceramics with 3 mol% alkali metal oxides were prepared, and the 3 moi% alkali metal oxides were induced by 3 mol% Na2O only, 1.5 mol% Na2O + 1.5 mol% Li2O, and 1.5 moi% Na2O + 1.5 moi% K2O, respectively. Effects of alkali metal oxides on the crystallization behavior and acid corrosion resistance of the MgO-Al2O3-SiO2-TiO2 glass-ceramics were investigated. The results showed that-cordierite precipitated in the glass matrix firstly, and it changed into a-cordierite with the crystallization temperature increasing. Using K2O substitution of Na2O hindered the precipitation of cordierite, while the addition of Li2O promoted the precipitation of p-cordierite at low temperatures. When the main crystalline phase was-cordierite, the acid resistance of the glass-ceramics was significantly improved compared with the base glass. With the main crystalline phase changing from g-cordierite to a-cordierite, the acid resistance of the glass-ceramics became worse, Which was related to the honeycomb structure of a-cordierite. When 1.5 mol% Na2O was replaced by Li2O, the glass samples crystallized at 880 degrees C showed the optimum acid resistance with the minimum weight loss 0.096%.

AB Short range order of As40-xCuxTe60 (x = 0, 10, 20, 25, 30) glasses was studied by neutron- and X-ray diffraction, combined with extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) measurements at the K-edges of all components. Large-scale structural models were generated by fitting the experimental datasets simultaneously in the framework of the reverse Monte Carlo simulation technique. These simulations revealed that As and Te atoms bind to about 3 and 2 As/Te neighbors, respectively, both of which possess Cu neighbors. The Cu Te bond length is 2.57 +/- 0.02 angstrom while the Cu As distance is as high as 2.86 +/- 0.04 angstrom. The results further showed that besides As and Te, Cu atoms also bind to Cu. The total coordination number of Cu is significantly higher than 4 for the compositions x = 25 and 30.

AB Computational simulation of the extrusion of a glass preform for drawing microstructured optical fibers was used to study processing induced distortion and drift of the holes within the preform. Such distortion is the primary weakness of the extrusion approach. The validated model from a previous study for a preform with 36 holes is used herein for a sensitivity analysis. Symmetry of the cross section allows analysis of a thirty-degree subdomain, which contains five holes. Scalar variables are introduced to quantify preform deformation, hole distortion and hole drift. The manuscript describes and compares data sets and normalizing procedures for these variables, in order to choose a suitable set that facilitates the interpretation of the deformation, as well as the comparison between the outputs of different die designs. For two related die inserts, the sensitivity of these variables with respect to the level of friction ranging from no friction to no-slip, was studied in detail for the five holes. Such a study is required to identify ways to optimize the die insert geometry that creates the lattice of holes in the preform. Optimization is addressed in Part II, which is a companion study.

AB Highly transparent and durable self-cleaning materials became demanding for diverse applications. To attain such goals, glass system with composition (69 x)TeO2-20ZnO-10Na(2)O-1Er(2)O(3)-(x)TiO2, where x = 0.0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3 and 0.4 mol% were synthesized using the conventional melt quenching method and characterized. For the first time, the influence of embedded TiO2 (Titania) nanoparticles (TNPs) concentration variation on the selfcleaning and spectral properties was examined to establish their correlation. TEM micrograph revealed the nucleation of spherical TNPs (average size approximate to 14 run) inside the amorphous matrix. Reduction in the optical band gap energy (from 3.08-3.03 eV) and water contact angle (from 68 degrees to 43 degrees) both were evidenced with the increase in TNPs contents, wherein the later one (reduced contact angle or enhanced wettability) was attributed to the enhanced hydrophilicity of the glass samples. Conversely, a slight increase in the methylene blue (MB) degradation rate with the increase of TNPs contents up to 0.2 mol% indeed indicated an improved photocatalytic activity of the synthesized glass. The absorption spectra exhibited ten significant bands of Er3+ ions in the wavelength range of 407 to 1532 nm. The emergent three prominent photoluminescence (PL) emission bands of the glass sample (with 0.2 mol% of TNPs) positioned at 535 nm, 555 nm and 670 nm were enhanced by a factor of 6.77, 4.56 and 2.00, respectively. Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) band of the embedded TNPs inside the glass was detected around 581 nm. Furthermore, Raman band of the glass (containing 0.4 mol% of TNPs) centred at 845 cm(-1) displayed an intensity enhancement by a factor of 3.58 times, which was ascribed to the TNPs localized SPR field mediated effect. It is established that the measured enhanced hydrophilicity (self cleanliness) and improved spectral features of the present glass composition was steered by the TNPs surface plasmon assisted effects.

AB Recently, great importance has been devoted to different glass systems doped with rare-earth ions because of their peculiar properties, in particular in the field of high-energy physics for particle energy measurement. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the optical and physical properties of Dy3+, Er3+ Nd3+ doped glasses belonging to the 20BaO-20Bi(2)O(3)-60B(2)O(3) system in which several rare-earths oxide concentrations were added to encounter the requirements for particle energy measurement. High density, low refractive index, high emission intensity (or high scintillation yield) are required for this purpose. Moreover, molar volume, glass transition and melting temperatures, X-ray diffraction and Raman spectra were measured and discussed in order to characterize the glass state. All the properties measured have shown a non-linear trend moving from 1 mol% to 10 mol% of rare-earths content. At the same time comparison between the trend derived by samples with same stoichiometry but containing different rare earths highlight different behaviors. In particular the highest density has been reached with the glass where Dy2O3 is at 2,5 mol%.

AB The novelty of this work is the comparison of two methods to determine the dissolution kinetics in order to evaluate the applicability of the Johnson-Mehl-Avrami-Kolmogorov (JMAK) model for the crystals dissolution in silicate melts. For this, this work focuses on the dissolution of rare earth (RE) silicates (Ca2RE8(SiO4)(6)O-2 where RE = Nd) with an apatite structure in a sodium-borosilicate glass melt. The first approach consists in the characterization of the dissolution kinetics by following the crystalline area fraction by image analysis as a function of time and temperature. Then, a model based on the generalized JMAK equation is proposed to fit the experimental data. This model enables to determine both the mechanism limiting the dissolution (i.e. the diffusion) and the activation energy of 'crystals dissolution in the studied glass system (496 kJ/mol). To support these results, a second and most common approach is the measure of the chemical profiles at the crystal/melt interfaces by microprobe. The conclusions obtained by this last method are in agreement with the conclusions based on JMAK model. All these results allowed to confirm that the JMAK model is well suited to model crystals dissolution in silicate melts.

AB Characterization of the alteration layers that form on glass surfaces during corrosion processes provides valuable information on both the mechanisms and rate of glass alteration. In recent years, state-of-the-art materials and surface characterization techniques have been employed to study various aspects of the alteration layers that result from corrosion, In most cases, these techniques are destructive and thus can only be employed at the end of the corrosion experiment. Here, we show that the alteration layers can be investigated by non-destructive spectroscopic ellipsometry (SE), which provides pertinent information on alteration layer thickness, morphology, and, through correlation of the index of refraction, porosity. SE measurements of silicate glass coupons altered in aqueous solutions of pH 3, 5, 7, 9, and 11 at 90 degrees C for 7 days are compared to cross-sectional secondary electron microscopy images. In most cases, quantitative agreement of the alteration layer thickness is obtained. The fractional porosity calculated from the index of refraction is lower than the porosity calculated from elemental analysis of the aqueous solutions, indicating that the alteration layer has compacted during corrosion or the subsequent supercritical CO2 drying process.

AB Organic groups on silica aerogels (SAs) introduced by surface modification not only achieve the hydrophobicity but also constitute the primary combustible components. In this study, the flammability of the typical precursor, i.e., tetraethoxysilane (TEOS) and sodium silicate (SS), synthetic SAs was investigated separately by cone calorimeter. The results demonstrated that SS based SAs had less fire hazards, smoke toxicity and larger critical heat flux, corresponding to lower flammability, compared to TEOS based SAs. Further research indicated that the lower flammability of SS based SAs should be attributed to a less quantity of organic groups which was related to their microstructure, especially specific surface area. The phosphorous components in SAs introduced by phosphoric acid contributed to improving the flame retardancy as the indication of a reduced gross calorific value. Besides, TG-DSC analysis revealed that SS based SAs had higher thermal stability with an improved onset temperature and peak temperature for the organic groups' oxidation reactions. Thus, it can be concluded that using sodium silicate as precursor and introducing phosphorous compounds contributed to improving the flame retardancy of SAs.

AB Planar flow casting (PFC) is a major method for industrial preparing amorphous ribbon. The key factors that affect ribbon formation in PFC are temperature and thermal stable time of cooling roller. This study proposes a new approach to investigate the transient three-dimensional temperature of the cooling roller using variable heat flux as the boundary condition. Firstly, the heat flux acted on the roller outer wall is calculated by two-dimensional heat transfer model. Employing the heat flux as the boundary condition, the three-dimensional transient temperature of the cooling roller is then analyzed. This study also examines the effects of the roller thickness and" diameter on the temperature and stable time. Results show that the heat conduction in the roller not only in the radial direction but also in the width direction. The temperature is unevenly distributed, reaching the peak value in the middle width position, and the roller achieves thermal equilibrium after about 120 s of casting. In addition, the roller thickness mainly affects the stable time and the temperature of the inner wall; the diameter affects the stable time as well as the temperatures of both the inner and outer walls. Finally, the reliability of the simulation approach and results are verified by measuring the roller transient evolution temperature on the spot with the infrared thermal imager. This study provides the reference for the selection of roller parameters and the prediction of roller stable time during the PFC process.

AB The compositional evolution of the network structure of binary (BaO)(x)(TeO2)(100 -x), glasses (5 <= x <= 25) is studied using two-dimensional Te-125 isotropic-anisotropic correlation nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. It is demonstrated that only a consideration of the full Te-125 chemical shift tensor in combination with the composition dependent evolution of isotropic Te-125 NMR line shape can yield a consistent structural model of these glasses in terms of the complex tellurium speciation. When taken together, the results indicate that the addition of the modifier BaO results in a progressive depolymerization of the network of corner- and edge-shared TeO4/2 trigonal bipyramids via their replacement with primarily a combination of negatively charged TeO3/20 trigonal bipyramids and TeO1/2O2 trigonal pyramids with one and two non-bridging oxygen, respectively.

AB A novel series of borate glasses in the composition, xCo(3)O(4) + (50 - x) (V2O5) + 50 B2O2 where x = 0.05 to 0.45 have been prepared by melt quenching technique. X-ray diffraction studies confirmed the non-crystalline nature of the samples. The room temperature density and molar volume varied non-linearly with cobalt concentration. Electrical conductivity and activation energy were determined and both varied non-linearly with cobalt concentration. Conductivity reached minimum and activation energy reached maximum at x = 0.4 of cobalt concentration. This anomalous behavior is due to the enhancement of Anderson localization caused by increase in configurational disorder. Various polaron related parameters were investigated in the light of Mott's SPH model for T > theta D/2. The density of states at fermi level was determined using Greaves VRH model which adequately explains conductivity for T < theta D/2. The nonlinear variation in various physical parameters with second TMI is attributed to the Mixed transition effect.

AB In this work we present our findings performing low frequency Raman measurements over temperature in a tellurite-tungstate glass sample. The spectra could be fitted by using only two log-Gaussians, which suggests that quasi-elastic light scattering is negligible. The positions of the peaks have the same temperature behavior, being the higher frequency one refereed as Boson Peak in literature. The similar temperature behavior and depolarization ratio indicates that the peaks may have the same origin, being linked to the transversal and longitudinal vibrations of some unit.

AB Ge10Se90 (-) Te-x(x) (x = 10, 20, 30) alloys have been prepared by the conventional melt quenching technique. Several important physical parameters have been calculated to understand the structural changes in the prepared compositions. Spectroscopic ellipsometry technique has been used to investigate the optical properties of the deposited thin films. The extracted optical constants have been utilized to evaluate several interesting optoelectrical parameters. The prepared films have revealed indirect energy gap transition that varied from 1.4 to 1.02 eV. Increasing Te content leads to the increase in the joint density of states (JDOS) in the investigated films which is accompanied by the decrease in the energy gap. Profound analysis has been made to study the variation of physical, optical, and optoelectrical parameters of Ge10Se90 (-) Te-x(x) Per as a function of Te content. Moreover, it was fruitful to estimate the changes in the nonlinear parameters of the studied films. An obvious increase in the nonlinear parameters has been observed with the increase in Te percent. This refers to an increase in the nonlinear response of bound electrons in the glassy system to the applied electric field. Believing this we may expect the usage of the samples under investigation in non-linear devices. The studied parameters have enriched our current knowledge regards to the nature of the studied compositions.

AB Measurements of fracture toughness from the crack tip opening displacement (CTOD) testing methods are complex and paramount important for a range of bulk metallic glasses (BMGs). In this work, we attempted to propose an indentation protocol to evaluate indentation fracture toughness based on two key considerations: First, the plastic deformation induced damage to the characteristic fracture initiation point calculated from integrating the indentation load-displacement curves is obtained and used to estimate indentation fracture toughness. Second, the continuum damage mechanics theory has been adopted to identify the characteristic fracture initiation point. To verify the applicability of the suggested approach, fracture toughness values of BMGs were estimated and compared with those from CTOD tests in the literature. The estimated fracture toughness values Kc obtained from the indentation tests agreed well with those K-Q from the CTOD tests within an approximately relative difference of 10%. We also found that K9 linearly correlates with K-C (K-Q = 1.1K(C) - 3.7). The value of K-Q in Al-based BMG is predicted to be similar to 35 MPa root m.

AB Novel Er3+ and Yb3+ doped transparent oxyfluoride glass ceramics containing NaLaF4 nanocrystals were prepared from oxyfluoride glasses with general composition of Na2O-NaF-LaF3-Al2O3-SiO2. The crystallization processes, changes in morphology and upconversion luminescence were analyzed. The heat treatment of the precursor glasses promoted the formation of hexagonal NaLaF4 and an unidentified fluorite type compound. An enhancement of upconversion luminescence with the introduction of YbF3 in the glass ceramics was detected and indicated an efficient energy transfer from Yb3+ to Er3+. The local environment of Er3+ in hexagonal NaLaF4 and the fluorite phase was analyzed using site-selective spectroscopy and compared with polycrystalline ceramics. The incorporation of Er3+ ions in three non-equivalent cationic sites in the crystalline lattice of hexagonal NaLaF4 nanocrystals was observed. The local environment of erbium ions in the fluorite phase was found to be similar to alpha-NaYF4 suggesting the formation of Er3+ and Yb3+ stabilized alpha-NaLaF4.

AB In this work, the near-infrared photoluminescence properties in Tm3+/Ho3+ co-doped tellurite glass was investigated. The tellurite glass with composition TeO2-ZnO-Na2O-La2O3 was synthesized using conventional melt quenching technique and characterized by UV/Vis/NIR absorption and near-infrared emission spectroscopies, fluorescence decay measurement and differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) analysis. Under the excitation of 808 nm laser diode (LD), a broadband 2.0 inn band luminescence ranging from 1600 to 2200 nm with a full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 362 nm was observed, which was contributed by 1.85 pm fluorescence from Tm3+: F-3(4) -> H-3(6) and 2.05 pm fluorescence from Ho3+: I-5(7) -> I-5(8). The fluorescence emission of Ho3+ was originated from the energy transfer from Tm3+ to Ho3+ ions, and the energy transfer mechanism was elucidated by analyzing fluorescence decay behavior of Tm3+ and quantitative calculation of phonon contribution joined in the energy transfer process. Meanwhile, based on the absorption spectrum, some important spectroscopic parameters such as Judd-Ofelt intensity parameter, spontaneous radiative transition probability, fluorescence branching ratio, absorption and emission cross-sections, and gain coefficient spectrum were calculated to reveal the spectroscopic properties of doped tellurite glass. Furthermore, from the DSC curve it can be derived that the investigated glass possesses a good thermal stability with Delta T( = T-x - T-g) larger than 152 degrees C. These results indicate that Tm3+/Ho3+ co-doped tellurite glass could be a promising gain medium applied for 2.0 mu m near infrared band broad fiber amplifiers and tunable fiber lasers.

AB Electron transport properties and thermal stability of Ni33.3Zr66.7 metallic glass (MG) have been studied using an original device for simultaneous measurements of electrical resistivity and absolute thermoelectric power (ATP) controlled by a LabView software written by one of us. The electrical resistivity and absolute thermoelectric power were measured simultaneously and very accurately over a temperature range from 25 to 400 degrees C with a nominal heating rate of 0.5 K min(-1). The electronic thermal conductivity was also determined using the Wiedemann-Franz law in the same temperature range. Due to its high efficiency, this technique is more and more used because it is characterized by a high sensitivity to detection of the phase transitions related to electronic transport, which is the aim of this study. Analysis of the temperature dependence of the resistivity and ATP of the Ni33.3Zr66.7 glassy ribbons proves the potential of this characterization method to study the thermal behavior of metallic glasses. The crystal structure and the morphology of Ni33.3Zr66.7 metallic glass in the as quenched state and after heat treatments were studied using X-ray diffraction (XRD), and scanning electron microscope (SEM).

AB We present emerging structural and transport properties of amorphous Al60-xMnxCu40. We observed, in all structural data, a dominant peak in the structure factor S(K) at scattering vector K-pe similar or equal to 2k(p) in reciprocal space, with 2k(F) the diameter of the Fermi sphere which is related to local spherical structural periodicity of nearest neighbor shells at medium-range distances in real space. The characteristic atomic distances between nearest neighbor shells are determined by the Friedel wavelength, half of the Fermi wavelength. We discussed the structural features, as caused by an optimized global resonances between the electronic and the static atomic structure, with subsequent consequences on structural stabilization and electronic transport. The global resonances are self-organizing by the exchange of characteristic momentum together with energy, trigger density anomalies and hybridization effects. We show strong indications for a combined action of density anomaly and hybridization. Within the homogeneous amorphous phase, higher the Manganese content, stronger is the hybridization with higher structural stability. Under global resonances both the electronic transport properties and thermal stability data are strongly correlated with the structural determination,

AB Owing to the outstanding service life of metallic prostheses, a substantial effort has been put into their surface modification to improve biocompatibility and reduce metallic ion diffusion. To satisfy these requirements, the coating materials obtained using the sol-gel method, with its wide range of tuning properties, have been extensively explored. The well-known biocompatibility of these materials makes them good candidates for different biomedical applications. We designed a series of siloxane-gelatin hybrids to be used as coatings for metallic implants or in controlled delivery systems. Two different matrixes were designed based on methyltrimethoxysilane (MTMOS), tetraethoxysilane (TEOS) and 3-glycidoxypropyltrimethoxysilane (GPTMS) alkoxysilane precursors. In one hybrid coating gelatin was physically entrapped and in the other it was linked to the siloxane network by covalent bonds. Synthesis parameters were established by studying the sol-gel reaction using Si-29 nuclear magnetic resonance (Si-29 NMR), which also allowed quantification of the network connectivity. Dissolution and degradation studies showed the effectiveness of GPTMS as a covalent coupling agent between the silica and gelatin phases; it increased the stability of the coatings in aqueous media. The aim of this study was to design a set of hybrid materials with highly tailorable properties, suitable for their potential biomedical applications.

AB The peculiarities of sinter-crystallization of La2O3 center dot SrO center dot 5B(2)O(3) fine glass powder (below 1 mu m) are investigated and discussed. The sintering was studied by contactless optical dilatometry and porosity measurements. The crystallization process was evaluated by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and the crystalline phase formation was analyzed by X-ray diffraction (XRD). Finally the microstructures of the samples sintered at different temperatures were observed by field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM).
   The specific aim of this study was to highlight the influence of sintering temperature and heating rate on the densification process and the final structure of glass-ceramic samples. It was shown that zero water adsorption and minimum closed porosity of similar to 3% were obtained at heating rate of 2 degrees C/min and at about 1 h holding at 690 degrees C. The temperature increase accelerated intense foaming process that resulted in formation of total porosity of 35-45%. It was also demonstrated that the foaming depended on the heating rate: the higher the heating rate - the more intensive was the bloating. The observed foaming process was related to intensive crystallization and re-crystallization of La2O3 center dot SrO center dot 5B(2)O(3) crystal phase. The phase formation processes entirely completed after 30-60 min at 730-740 degrees C with the formation of intriguing and unusual crystal structures.

AB The effects of pre-compression treatment at room temperature on the microstructures, mechanical properties, and corrosion resistance in the seawater solution of Cu47.5Zr47.5Al5 bulk metallic glasses (BMGs) have been investigated. The amount and size of B-2-CuZr nanocrystallites precipitated from the glass matrix increase with enhancing the pre-compression stress, which suggests that the appropriate pre-compression treatment promotes the formation of metallic glass matrix composites (MGMCs). The 850 MPa pre-compressed MGMC possesses the highest compressive fracture strength (1814 MPa) and a certain degree of plasticity, as well as the larger hardness of 700 HV. The 1415 MPa pre-compressed MGMC with more B-2-CuZr nanocrystallites demonstrates advantages in thermal stability and corrosion resistance in the seawater solution. It shows the higher corrosion resistance with the most positive corrosion potential and the lower corrosion current density than the other tested samples. These can be attributed to the structural homogeneity after appropriate precipitation of nano-crystallites.

The super-cooled liquid region was evaluated to be Delta T = Tx - Tg = 22 degrees C, where Tx is the temperature of crystallization and Tg is the glass transition temperature. The thermal stability of this material was investigated using different measurement methods. No crystallization was detected after 30 min at 120 degrees C, which is of major interest for sterilization processes in the medical field. Resistance to crystallization was also investigated. All the results highlight the suitability of this new metallic glass for biomedical applications.

AB The effects of alkaline earth metal oxides (RO) concentrations on the network structure and properties of non-alkali aluminoborosilicate glasses were studied. With the increasing of RO concentrations from 10 to 20 mol%, the number of Q(4) units decreased, while the number of Q(3) units increased. The [AlO4] units always pre-dominated in Al groups, and the fraction of [BO4] among B groups increased from 2% to 10%. Meantime, the value of NBO/T increased from 0.48 to 0.70, indicating the weak network connectivity. The depolymerization of T-O-T network resulted in higher coefficient of thermal expansion, lower temperature of transition point, weaker durability in HF acid. While, the increasing in R2+ cations and [BO4] units led to the higher elastic modulus of glasses. The increasing in RO also enhanced the density, dielectric constant and durability in NaOH solution of glasses.

AB In Part I of this computational study, scalar variables were introduced to quantify the quality of the cross-sectional geometry of a glass preform used to draw Microstructured Optical Fibers (MOF). These non-dimensional variables measure the processing induced distortions that occur during extrusion of the preform. That study investigated flow through two die designs, and showed that the distortions, which can limit the use of this technology, are a strong function of friction that accompanies interface slip. Furthermore, it was observed that a short welding chamber length, while producing a complex flow, might allow for an optimization of the die to produce a desired final geometry. An extensive sensitivity analysis set the stage for the current optimization study, which includes two approaches. First, the radii of the circular feed holes in the two die designs were altered. Within the computational domain, there are 17 and 13 feed holes in the two designs. Second, the five circular pins that create the holes in the preform were modified in both shape and position. Results show that the DAP parameter, which quantifies the degree of circularity of the holes, can be used to guide optimization of the feed hole size and pin shape to drastically reduce hole distortion. Furthermore, for the examples considered, the drift of the holes from their desired positions was simultaneously improved.

AB Bio-polymer electrolyte iota-carrageenan (I-carrageenan) with ammonium nitrate (NH4NO3) has been prepared by solution-casting technique. The increase in amorphous nature of the bio-polymer electrolyte due to the addition of salt has been confirmed by X-ray diffraction analysis. From the XRD spectra, the average particle size has been calculated using the Debye-Scherrer formula and the value is 0.98 nm. The complex formation between the polymer and the salt has been confirmed by Fourier transform infra-red spectroscopy. The glass transition temperature of the bio-polymer I-carrageenan with NH4NO3 electrolytes has been found using differential scanning calorimetric technique. From the AC impedance spectroscopic analysis, the ionic conductivity value has been found to be 1.46 x 10(-3) S/cm at ambient temperature for the composition of 1.0 g I-carrageenan: 0.4 wt% NH4NO3. The temperature dependent conductivity of the polymer electrolyte obeys an Arrhenius relationship. The dielectric behavior has been analyzed using dielectric permittivity (epsilon*) and the relaxation frequency (tau) has been calculated from the loss tangent spectra (tan delta). The modulus spectra indicate non-Debye nature of the material. Ionic transference number has been found to be 0.95 for the polymer 1.0 g I-carrageenan: 0.4 wt% NH4NO3. The result reveals that the conducting species are predominantly due to ions. Electrochemical stability window of 2.46 V has been measured by using linear sweep voltammetry for the highest ionic conducting membrane. A primary proton battery has been constructed with the highest conductivity sample and open circuit voltage has been found to be 1.04 V. Fuel cell has been constructed with the highest proton conductivity polymer 1.0 g I-carrageenan: 0.4 wt% NH4NO3 and the open circuit voltage found to be 442 mV.

Optical absorption and photoluminescence emission of CdS/ZnS-doped silico-phosphate films were investigated. CdS/ZnS nano-crystalline particles were put into evidence by X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) spectroscopy. The specific vibration modes of the constituents were evidenced by structural analysis carried out by Raman and Fourier Transform Infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). The characteristic fluorescence emission of CdS/ZnS nanoparticles was noticed in the visible domain. The morphology of the films was investigated by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) and Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM). Clusters of hexagonal crystalline CdS/ZnS QDs were put into evidence.

AB The composition of the matrix glass has a significant effect on the luminescent property and density of the scintillating glass. In this paper, the Ce3+/Tb3+ co-doped Gd2O3-B2O3-SiO2 (GBS) scintillating glasses were melted in reducing atmosphere. The effects of Gd3+ on the luminescent property and density of scintillating glass were studied. The results show that increasing Gd3+ ions concentration can increase the density of the scintillating glass. The energy transfer from Gd3+ to Tb3+ in the glass can sensitizes the luminescence of Tb3+ ions. Meanwhile, the increase of Gd3+ ions concentration increases the optical basicity of the glass and the electrons on the Ce3+ ion 4f orbit are more likely to migrate to 5d orbit, which promotes the energy transfer from Ce3+ to Tb3+. However, the concentration of Gd3+ ions is too high to cause concentration quenching and Ce3+ ion charge transfer quenching, which are not conducive to the light of the glass.

AB Modifier-mixing provides a useful tool for tailoring the structural dynamics of oxide glasses. Its physical basis, however, remains subject to intense discussion. Here, we extend our previous consideration of Ca-Mg mixing in alkaline earth metaphosphate glasses [J. Non-Cryst. Solids 468, 74-81 (2017)] across the broader range of alkaline earth species. We report on the effects of divalent modifier mixing for pairs selected from the group of Mg, Ca, Sr and Ba. For this, short-range structural features as obtained from nuclear magnetic resonance, Raman and far-infrared spectroscopy are related to various physical properties, including ionic mobility. Depending primarily on the difference in ion size and bond localization among the modifier cation species, we find different extents of the mixed-modifier effect. This agrees with the dynamic structure model in which the mismatch of cation sites governs non-linear mixing effects.

AB Lithium disilicate glass-ceramics show great potential in the fabrication of anisotropic structures due to their high-strength needle-form crystalline phase subjective to processing-induced alignment. Here we explore this strategy by focusing on the mechanistic aspects of fracture. Through different variations of the fracture toughness test we demonstrate the effect of bulk crystal orientation on fracture energy, toughening mechanisms, crystal size and aspect ratio. Using the anisotropic Poisson's ratio of the Li2Si2O5 crystal phase obtained by Resonant Ultrasound Spectroscopy, we apply the new geometry factor developed by Strobl et al. to provide a more accurate insight into the anisotropic crack propagation behavior in LS2 glass-ceramics. Raman spectra and X-Ray Diffraction patterns are resolved for the Li2Si2O5 phase aligned at plane parallel, anti-plane and random orientations.
   We show that Li2Si2O5 crystallites oriented perpendicular to the crack growth plane tended to induce large scale crack deflection unless the crack was forced into a straight path, thereby promoting crystallite fracture, increased K-Ic-values and accentuated R-curve behavior. Crystal aspect ratio and residual stresses in the glass have been identified as important influencing factors on crack growth behavior and toughening mechanisms.

AB In this work, ab initio molecular dynamics simulations have been performed to determine the local structures of molten Ni1-xCox and Ni1-xFex binary alloys. The results reveal that the spin-polarized Setting is crucial to simulating Ni1-xFex alloys, while for Ni1-xCox the magnetic and nonmagnetic simulations yield similar results. The bonding tendency of cobalt is not very obvious while Fe atoms prefer hetero-coordination in nickel-based binary alloys. Pentagonal bipyramids are prevalent in both Ni1-xCox and Ni1-xFex, but icosahedral short-range order (ISRO) is not abundant as expected. Besides, the coordination short-range orders of Ni1-xCox and Ni1-xFex are rather similar, distinguishing from those in Ni1-xAlx, which means the local melt structure depends on the specific solute-solvent interaction in nickel-based binary alloys.

AB The lithium disilicate (LD) glass-ceramics with the SiO2-Li2O-R2O-Al2O3-P2O5-CeO2 system were prepared by adding R2O (R = K, Rb, Cs) as modifier. The effects of R2O addition on the crystallization behavior, microstructure and fracture strength of the LD glass-ceramics were investigated by differential thermal analysis (DTA), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) etc. The results indicate that the fracture strength of LD glass-ceramics could be improved greatly by introducing Rb2O or Cs2O instead of K2O, therein, introducing Rb2O instead of K2O improved the fracture strength by 26% and Cs2O substituting K2O improved the fracture strength by 37%. The crystallization activation energy of different crystal phase was calculated. It was found that the lower the crystallization activation energy of lithium disilicate is, the higher the fracture strength of LD glass-ceramic achieves. Based on the results, a new chemical strengthening theory of LD glass-ceramic has been proposed, which is of great significance for developing ID dental restorative materials and other functional glasses.

AB Controlled drug delivery is one of the most intruding field in pharmaceutical research. It is desired for most of the drugs due to safety and efficacy reasons. Another emerging field is improving the bioavailability of poorly water-soluble drugs. By encapsulating such drugs into biodegradable polysaccharide materials both, improved bioavailability and controlled drug release is readily expected. Nifedipine, used as a model drug, was encapsulated within polysaccharide gels by the novel ethanol induced gelation method. Wet materials were processed by supercritical technology to retain its form and structure. Swelling and in-vitro dissolution tests were performed to investigate the swelling of aerogels and release behavior of nifedipine within body fluids. It was observed that guar and xanthan are not the best candidates for oral delivery of nifedipine, since the release was prolonged to 14 days. Oppositely, pectin and alginate are both suitable for nifedipine encapsulation as they released 100% of nifedipine within the first 5 h. Higher drug loading was achieved by pectin aerogels most likely due to their higher surface area.

AB Glasses of the composition xCdF(2)center dot(100 - x)B2O3 (40 <= x <= 75 mol%) have been studied. X-ray diffraction (XRD), infrared spectroscopy (IR) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) were used to follow the structural changes and the effect on density and electric conduction of glasses. XRD indicated formation of crystalline phases at x = 80 mol%, including CdF2, Cd4OF6 and 3CdO center dot B2O3. SEM revealed formation of separated amorphous CdF2 clusters in all glasses and rounded crystalline particles at x = 80 mol%. IR spectra revealed that B2O3 is partially modified by CdF2, building four-coordinated boron units in the form of Cd-1/2(2+)[BO3F](-). The rest of CdF2 forms its own vitreous matrix. Density and molar volume have been correlated with the concentration of structural units. There is a limited increase in the electrical conductivity with CdF2 content, while the activation energy shows a maximum at similar to 60 mol CdF2. The correlation between both quantities has been discussed in terms of the parameters in Arrhenius relation.

   ORDER
AB Human interaction with multimedia devices occurs predominantly over inorganic glass surfaces. Scratch-induced damage is a primary limitation in the suitability of brittle glasses for this purpose. However, neither truly quantitative data nor a topo-chemical understanding of the underlying deformation process which would allow for the development of improved materials is presently available.
   Here, we present lateral nano-indentation experiments for determining the work of deformation which is involved in the process of glass scratching. Using a series of hot-compressed vitreous silica with mild degrees of structural densification, we derive relations between quantitative scratch hardness and the underlying glass structure. We show that Young's modulus provides a clear rational for the observed variations in scratching hardness. In the specific case of silica, the energy needed to generate a certain scratch volume corresponds to roughly one tenth of Young's modulus. This relationship formally indicates that only about one tenth of the bonds which are involved in the deformation process are broken in its course. However, comparison with a more complex glass material with a certain fraction of two dimensional structural units and a strong ability for topological adaption to local stress clearly indicates a deviation from this behavior. This opens a pathway to topochemical engineering of scratch-resistant glasses.

AB During the last decades, the nucleation and crystallization of the Li2O - SiO2 system has been widely investigated and its particular theoretical features disclosed. However, multicomponent lithium disilicate systems, being of higher technological interest, still require further studies aiming at better tailoring their relevant mechanical and chemical properties. Here we report on the effects of SiO2/Li2O molar ratio and the addition of P2O5 on the structure and crystallization behaviour of multicomponent lithium disilicate based glasses. Two non-stoichiometric P2O5-free lithium disilicate based glasses featuring equimolar contents of K2O and Al2O3 and with SiO2/Li2O molar ratios of 2.62 and 2.92 were synthesized in the Li2O - SiO2 system through the melt-quench technique. The influence of partially replacing (K2O + Al2O3) by P2O5 while keeping the same SiO2/Li2O molar ratios of P2O5-free glasses was investigated. The structural features of glasses were assessed by nuclear magnetic resonance. Differential thermal analysis was used to study crystallization kinetics and the crystalline phase evolution was followed by X-ray diffraction. The results showed that an increase in SiO2/Li2O molar ratio decreased the overall crystallization rate, preventing the formation of lithium disilicate. However, adding P2O5 had an opposite effect, enhancing the formation of fine lithium disilicate crystals. The nucleating role of P2O5 is discussed.

AB Recently glasses have been considered as potential candidates for solid-state batteries applications due to the peculiar properties that they show if compared to crystalline ones. In this work, the dynamic properties of copper (Cu1+) and lithium (Li1+) ions in phosphate glasses, in which Cu2O was progressively substituted to Li2O, were investigated and correlated with the glass structure analysis by using Molecular Dynamic (MD) simulations.
   The diffusion of Li+ ions and how it is influenced by Cu2+ and Cu1+ ions were highlighted. In this vitreous system, the Cu1+ ions diffuse interacting with the lithium diffusion.
   This results in the general increase of the activation energy of Li1+ as a function of the Cu2O content in these glasses. At the same time the substitution of Li2O by Cu2O leads to the decrease of the Ea of the Cu1+, mainly due to structural changes that promote the disruption of the Li1+ pathway and the creation of more stable Cu1+ sites. This explains the increased migrati on of this ion in higher copper content system.

AB In this study, in order to improve the mechanical properties of resorcinol-formaldehyde (RF) aerogel, synthesis of crosslinked aerogel using hexamethylene diisocyanate (HDI) as a crosslinking agent was investigated. The crosslinking was performed using exitu and in situ methods at two different concentrations of catalyst. The effects of the crosslinking and the catalyst concentration on the morphology and the mechanical properties of RF aerogels were evaluated by different analyzes. The Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) confirmed the reaction of HDI isocyanate groups with resorcinol hydroxyl groups. The Scanning Electron Microscope(SEM) and Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) results indicated changes in the morphology and thickening of the necks. For the crosslinked aerogels, compared to the native samples, a decrease of the compressive modulus and about five times increase in the compressive stress were obtained. Moreover, an improvement of the impact strength and a reduction in the hardness were observed.

AB Amorphous micro silica (MS) is used as a raw material in the production of porous calcium silicate. MS is a by-product from the silicon and silicon-alloy production, and strongly influences the properties of porous calcium silicate products. We investigate the kinetics of the formation of calcium silicate hydrate (C-S-H) gel from the reaction between quicklime and MS based on two types of MS (MS97.5 and MS92.8, which have 97.5 and 92.8 wt% SiO2, respectively). The C-S-H gel is found to be amorphous, but with short- and medium range order similar to tobermorite for the two types of MS. MS97.5 is found to react faster than MS92.8. The activation energy is determined to be 76 kJ/mol for MS97.5 and 103 kJ/mol for MS92.8. For comparable surface area of MS, the C-S-H formation mechanism is strongly affected by metallic or metal oxide impurities in two ways. First, the positively charged metal ions are attached to the negatively charged hydroxyl groups at the MS surface, resulting in less available hydroxyl groups for MS-quicklime reaction, and in lower solubility of MS. Second, impurities react with the calcium silicate network, making less raw material available for the reaction.

AB A new melt derived glass system consisting of Co2O3 added to 40P(2)O(5)center dot 25B(2)O(3)center dot 25CaO center dot 10Na(2)O matrix was investigated in order to evaluate the influence of cobalt ions on the network structure. Multiple techniques, i.e. Xray diffraction (XRD), Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy and X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) were used to characterize the local structure, the nature of the chemical bonding and the surface composition of these samples. The XRD measurements proved the vitreous character of samples with 0 and 3 mol% Co2O3. At higher cobalt oxide content (5, 7 and 10 mol%) the occurrence of a crystalline phase characteristic to Co2P4O12 has been observed. The complementary spectroscopic studies (FTIR and Raman) revealed that the incorporation of Co2O3 enhances the network connectivity and thereby the short range order in samples. Depending on their amount, the cobalt ions differently influence the borophosphate network via the tetraborate/triborate and metaphosphate/pyrophosphate ratios. For the sample containing 10 mol% Co2O3 the FTIR analysis indicates absorptions assigned to vibrations in CoO6 tetrahedra and suggests the presence of six-coordinated cobalt ions in Co3+ valence state. This study has proven that borophosphate based glasses are able to entrap cobalt ions, are sensitive from structural point of view to the amount of Co2O3 and possess interesting structural peculiarities.

AB Sodium zinc barium borotellurite glass systems doped with singly Er, Pr, and Er/Pr-codoped ions were fabricated via melt quenching method to study their structural, thermal, and gamma radiation shielding features. Both FTIR and Raman spectroscopic results revealed that the glass network matrix is prevailingly formed by TeO4, TeO3 (+) (1), TeO3, BO3 and BO4 structural clusters. The characteristic temperatures (glass transition (T-g), onset crystallization (T-x), peak crystallization (T-c), and melting (T-m)) and thermal stabilities (Delta T) were determined by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). An increase in 'T-g' and (Delta T) variation within the temperature range 123-164 degrees C with an addition of Er2O3, Pr6O11, and Er2O3/Pr6O11 oxides indicates that synthesized glasses possess good thermal stability. For selected glasses, mass attenuation coefficient (mu/rho) values calculated using both XCOM software and MCNP5 simulation code in the 0.015-15 MeV photon energy range were matched well. Moreover, based on the (mu/rho) values, various shielding parameters like effective atomic number (Z(eff)), electron density (N-e), mean free path (MFP) and half-value layer (HVL) are evaluated. Additionally, exposure buildup factor (EBF) values have been determined using Geometric Progression (G-P) fitting method in the energy range 0.015-15 MeV and up to a penetration depth of 40 mfp, and variation of all the shielding parameters is discussed for the effect of singly Er, Pr and doubly Er/Pr ions inclusion into the host glass. As an example, the prepared rare-earth (RE)-doped glasses show lower HVL values compared to 80TeO(2)-20MgO and 80TeO(2)-20MoO(3) (mol %) glasses suggesting their potentiality as good gamma radiation shielding materials.

AB Atomic processes giving rise to the photoinduced fluidity have been studied for amorphous selenium. Ab initio molecular orbital calculations of Se clusters suggest that distorted atomic structures such as curled and intersecting chains have smaller optical gaps. Those atomic sites are likely to be excited by subgap (Urbach-edge) light, which undergo structural relaxation including bond breakages and interchanges. Such photo-electro-structural transformations could originate the macroscopic fluidity. Possibility of electronic glass-transition is also discussed.

AB The effect of Al2O3 content on electrical conductivity and glass stability against crystallization in the system KH2PO4-Al2O3-P2O5 was investigated using Raman, IR, and impedance spectroscopies.
   DSC observations were carried out on glasses from a series of KH2PO4/(1 - x) P2O5/x Al2O3, with x = 0, 0.5, 0.1, 0.2 and 0.3 mol, to determine the relative glass stability. The DSC observations indicate that from x = 0.1 the glasses become more stable. For this composition (x = 0.1) the conductivity, which was obtained by AC impedance spectroscopic studies, was 7.0 x 10(-6) S.cm(-1) at room temperature.
   Spectroscopic investigations reveal the depolymerization of the phosphate glass network by systematic conversion of Q(2) structural units into Q(1) and finally into Q(0) structural units. Even though Q(2) to Q(1) conversion is taking place due to breaking of P-O-P linkages, formation of P-O-Al linkages provide cross linking between short P-structural units, which make the glass network more rigid.

AB Glass and anti-glass samples of Bi2O3-TeO2 and Bi2O3-Nb2O5-TeO2 were prepared by ice-water quenching and normal-quenching respectively. The bismuth tellurite system has poor glass forming ability (GFA) and forms a glassy phase at low Bi2O3 concentration of 2 to 5-mol%. On increasing Bi2O3 concentration to 10 mol%, a mixture of glass and anti-glass phases are formed by rapid quenching of the melt. A further increase in Bi2O3 concentration to 20 mol%, produces a sample consisting of entirely Bi2Te4O11 anti-glass upon melt-quenching. An anti-glass is a solid, which has long range order of cations (Te4+, Bi3+, Nb5+ etc.) but these are statistically distributed at their sites while the anion sites are partially vacant. Consequently the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of bismuth tellurite and bismuth niobium tellurite anti-glass samples show sharp XRD peaks but the Raman spectra show broad phonon bands due to disturbed short-range order of the anions. The addition of Nb2O5 to the Bi2O3-TeO2 system significantly enhances the GFA. Samples from the system: xBi(2)O(3)-xNb(2)O(5)-(100-2x)TeO2 grow micro-inclusions or spherulites of size of several micron within the glass matrix on slow melt cooling. Heat treatment of 7.5Bi(2)O(3)-7.5Nb(2)O(5)-85TeO(2) sample show structural transitions from glass anti glass -> crystalline phases.

The simulated results of mass attenuation coefficients were compared with the output of XCOM program. Good agreement was observed between simulated and XCOM results. The obtained mass attenuation coefficients were further used to calculate the effective atomic number, electron density, half value layer and mean free path. The maximum values of mass attenuation coefficients and effective atomic number were found for PZPb50 glass sample. The results from this study indicate that the MCNP5 code used in this work may be utilized as a better alternative to experimental work to make supplementary calculations on the photon attenuation characteristics of other materials and glass systems. The lower values of the mean free path of the selected samples as compared to the standard shielding concretes; establishes them as suitable gamma shields. PZPB50 is the best among the selected shielding glasses.

AB During the non-isothermal annealing of Cu33Zr67 metallic glass (MG), two abnormal crystallization behaviors were detected. Nano-crystal growth ceasing leads to amorphous/nano-crystalline dual-phase structure, and residual amorphous crystallization is accompanied by grain coarsening. The structural evolutions of Cu33Zr67 MG at atomic-level were observed by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy. By analyzing structural factors, the nano-crystal growth ceasing is attributed to the spatially variation of icosahedral short-range order density arising from the structural heterogeneity of Cu33Zr67 MG, and the concurrence of crystallization and grain coarsening is due to higher thermal stability of residual amorphous as compared to bct-CuZr2 nano structure.

AB Silica aerogel is one of the most attractive insulation materials but has not been broadly applied yet because of limitation of its fragile nature. In this work, we synthesized a compressible bacterial cellulose/silica aerogel composite from the co-precursor of tetraethylorthosilicate and methyltrimethoxylsilane by a two-step acid-base catalyzed sol-gel method followed by supercritical CO2 drying. This aerogel composite possessed a series of excellent properties: standing the considerable strain, high resilience, dust-free, low density of 0.066 g/cm(3) and low thermal conductivity of 0.0292 W/(m.K) along with hydrophobicity with a water contact angle of 147 degrees. Weight loss analysis indicated that the thermal stability of the as-prepared composites was about 270 degrees C which primarily depended on the thermal stability of the bacterial cellulose. These outstanding properties were attributed to the Interpenetration Polymer Network structure formed via the co-precursors and the bacterial cellulose and the excellent fabric of the aerogel retained by the supercritical CO2 drying. The results suggest that the as-prepared aerogel composite has potential applications as a suitable insulation material with dust-free and resilience.

AB A microscopic free energy model with an order parameter was introduced earlier that included a local frustration gauge field with U1 symmetry. Ad hoc values of this field were introduced to fit the NQR distribution of a powdered sample of As2Se3 glass and predict the glass and Kauzmann temperatures. Here we derive initial values of the local frustration force amplitudes from an associated molecular free energy. We show that these amplitudes as calculated solely as gradients of the free energy are too large, and that a force term derived from energy leaving the glass and entering the bath must be included to give the correct magnitude. The modification to the bath also acts as a U1 gauge transformation of the frustration field, and insures that the "freezing" process is irreversible, non-equilibrium, and approximately steady state.

AB We demonstrate the possibility of joint formation of fluorescent silver clusters and plasmonic silver nanoparticles spatially confined in micron-sized domains by the one-step femtosecond direct laser writing (DLW) without subsequent heat treatment in zinc phosphate glasses with different concentration of silver. We show that DLW in glass induces local micro-modification of optical properties resulted in the appearance of luminescence, absorption and form birefringence in domains. Variation of laser pulse energy allows controlling the micro modification process and tuning of optical properties. We propose a possible mechanism for observed phenomena that includes local chemical redistribution of glass network modifiers during DLW process. We believe that ability to form complex 3D shapes of luminescent, plasmonic and birefringent structures embedded in dielectric transparent glass materials opens new routes for the design of nanophotonic devices and multidimensional optical memory.

TI Diversity and evolution of the Confuciusornithidae: Evidence from a new

AB The Huajiying Formation contains the earliest deposits of the Jehol Biota, representing the world's second oldest avifauna. This avifauna includes the early confuciusornithid Eoconfuciusornis zhengi, the oldest occurrence of this Glade and one of the earliest divergences of pygostylian birds. Although E. zhengi shows unique traits, the holotype's immature age makes comparisons with the better known Confuciusornis sanctus problematic. As a result, the taxonomic validity of E. zhengi is controversial. We describe a small, osteologically adult confuciusornithid from the same deposits as E. zhengi. The new fossil is most similar to E. zhengi but also shares traits with the stratigraphically younger Confuciusornis. The humerus of the new fossil is straighter and more slender, and bears a less dorsally-developed deltopectoral crest compared with similarly-sized and smaller specimens of Confuciusornis. The morphology of the humerus is intermediate between E. zhengi and Confuciusornis and its proximal portion is pierced by a small deltopectoral foramen, absent in the holotype of E. zhengi. However, this foramen is much smaller than in any other confuciusornithid. Shape analyses (geometric morphometrics) of the humerus of confuciusornithids of different ages and representatives of other basal avians and closely-related non-avian theropods supports our observations and indicate that the humeral differences between the holotype of E. zhengi and the new specimen are not easily explained as ontogenetic variation within a single species. However, the limited number of early confuciursornithids does not allow us to confidently interpret such differences as interspecific. Nonetheless, these analyses support the morphological distinctiveness of the early confuciusornithids from the Huajiying Formation and suggest a stepwise acquisition of the unique humeral morphology of Confuciusornithidae.

AB Thirty-five stratigraphic section exposed along the Mukah-Selangau road in the Mukah-Balingian area have been studied. Sedimentological and palynological data have been integrated to gain a better insight into the depositional architecture of the area. Broadly, the Mukah-Balingian area is dominated by fluvial, floodplain and estuarine related coal-bearing deposits. The Balingian, Begrih and Liang formations have been described and interpreted in terms of seven fades association. These are: FA1 - Fluvial-dominated channel facies association; FA2 - Tide-influenced channel facies association; FA3 - Tide-dominated channel facies association; FA4 - Floodplain fades association; FA5 - Estuarine central basin-mud flats fades association; FA6 - Tidal flat facies association and FA7 - Coastal swamps and marshes facies association. The Balingian Formation is characterised by the transgressive phase in the base, followed by a regressive phase in the upper part. On the basis of the occurrence of Florscheutzia trilobata with Florscheutzia levipoli, the Early to Middle Miocene age has been assigned to the Balingian Formation. The distinct facies pattern and foraminifera species found from the samples taken from the Begrih outcrop imply deposition in the intertidal flats having pronounced fluvio-tidal interactions along the paleo-margin. Foraminiferal data combined with the pronounced occurrence of Stenochlaena laurifolia suggest at least the Late Miocene age for the Begrih Formation. The internal stratigraphic architecture of the Liang Formation is a function of a combination of sea level, stable tectonic and autogenic control. Based on strati graphic position, the Middle Pliocene to Pleistocene age for the Liang Formation is probable. The Balingian, Begrih and Liang formations display deposits of multiple regressive-transgressive cycles while the sediments were derived from the uplifted Penian high and Rajang group.

AB Three new fossil species, two attributed to the genus Castanopsis (C. nanningensis and C. guangxtensiS) and one to the organ genus Lithocarpoxylon (L. nanningensis) are described on the basis of well-preserved mummified wood from the upper Oligocene of Yongning Formation in the Nanning Basin, Guangxi Province, South China. The two species of Castanopsis represent the most ancient reliable wood record of this genus in China and also southeastern Asia, which is the center of diversity of extant species. The fossil leaf records of Castanopsis indicated this genus has migrated to South China in the late Eocene. This fossil wood evidence confirms the presence and persistence of Castanopsis in this region in the late Oligocene. In the Yongning Formation, the presence of numerous Fagaceae woods with faint or absent growth ring boundaries (in C. nanningensis) occasionally associated with prominent ring-porous patterns, suggests that Guangxi (South China) had a seasonal (probably monsoonal) tropical climate during the late Oligocene.

AB The Liaohe Delta in Northeast China is one of the ecologically important estuarine deltas in China. It has been formed via the accumulation of sediment discharged by four rivers in the Liaohe Plain that enter Liaodong Bay. Twenty-seven 30-40 m long cores recovered from the Liaohe Plain and Liaodong Bay were analyzed for sedimentary characteristics, grain size, foraminifera species, and ages determined by accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) C-14 to document the stratigraphical sequence and the spatio-temporal evolution of the Liaohe Delta. Our results revealed that the sedimentary environments have evolved from fluvial, tidal flat/estuarine, to neritic and finally to a deltaic environment since the Late Pleistocene. The Holocene transgression arrived at the present coastline at similar to 8500 cal a BP and flooded the maximum area of land at similar to 7000 cal a BP. A deltaic environment prevailed in this area after 7000 cal a BP. Bounded by the modern Liaohe River mouth, the present deltaic sedimentary system can be divided into the eastern and western components. The rate of seaward progradation of the eastern paleocoastline was estimated to be similar to 8.6 m/a since 7000 cal a BP; the eastern cores in the present coastline began receiving the deltaic sediments at similar to 5000 cal a BP. The rate of seaward progradation of the western paleocoastline was estimated to be only similar to 2.8 m/a since 7000 cal a BP. The coastline on the western side began accumulating deltaic sediments about 2000 years later than the eastern coastline. Depocenter shifting was hypothesized to be the reason for the spatial differences in the sedimentary processes. However, the change of sediment fluxes of the western rivers due to climate changes and ancient human impacts might be the reason for the differences of the temporal evolution of the eastern and western sedimentary systems in the Liaohe Delta.

AB The estuarine-inner shelf mud regions of the East China Sea (ECS) are valuable for studying the source-to-sink processes of fluvial sediments deposited since the Holocene. In this study, we present evidence of the provenance and environmental evolution of two cores (S5-2 and JC07) from the estuarine-inner shelf regions of the ECS over the past 100 years based on Pb-210 dating, high-resolution grain size measurements and clay mineral analyses. The results indicate that the clay mineral assemblages of cores S5-2 and JC07 are dominated by illite, followed by kaolinite and chlorite, and present scarce amounts of smectite. A comparison of these clay mineral assemblages with several major sources reveals that the fine sediments on the estuarine-inner shelf of the ECS represent a mixture of provenances associated with the Yangtze and Yellow Rivers, as well as smaller rivers. However, the contribution of each provenance has varied greatly over the past hundred years, as indicated by the down-core variability due to strong sediment reworking and transport on the inner shelf and the reduction of the sediment load from the Yangtze River basin. In the mud region of the Yangtze River estuary, the sediment from 1930 to 1956 was primarily derived from the Yangtze River, although the Yellow River was also an important influence. From 1956 to 2013, the Yellow River contribution decreased, whereas the Yangtze River contribution correspondingly increased. In the Zhe-Min mud region, the Yangtze River contributed more sediment than did other rivers from 1910 to 1950; however, the Yangtze River contribution gradually decreased from 1950 to 2013. Moreover, the other small rivers accounted for minor contributions, and the East Asian winter monsoon (EAWM) played an important role in the sediment transport process in the ECS. Our results indicate that the weakening/strengthening of the EAWM and a decrease in the sediment load of the Yangtze River influenced the transport and fate of sediment on the estuarine-inner shelf of the ECS.

AB Deep tectonic processes are key integral components in the evolution of mountain belts, while observations of their temporal development are generally obscured by thermal resetting, retrograde alteration and structural overprinting. Here we recorded an integrated rock time-temperature history for the first time in the pro-wedge part of the active Taiwan arc-continent collision starting from sedimentation through cleavage-forming state to its final exhumation. The integrated thermal and age results from the Raman Spectroscopy of Carbonaceous Material (RSCM) method, zircon U-Pb laser ablation dating, and in-situ Ar-40/Ar-39 laser microprobe dating suggest that the basal accretion process was crucial to the development of the Taiwanese orogenic wedge. The basal accretion process commenced early in the mountain building history (similar to 6 Ma) and gradually migrated to greater depths, as constrained by persistent plate convergence and cleavage formation under nearly isothermal state at similar depths until similar to 2.5 Ma recorded in the early-accreted units. Such development essentially contributed to mountain root growth by the increased depth of the wedge detachment and the downward wedge thickening during the incipient to full collision stages in the Taiwan mountain belt.

AB We examined the source-to-sink sediment transport processes from the Changjiang River to the estuarine coastal shelf area by analyzing the clay mineral assemblages in suspended sediment samples from the Changjiang River catchment and surface samples from the estuarine coastal shelf area following the impoundment of the Three Gorges Dam (TGD) in 2003. The results indicate that the clay mineral compositions throughout the study area are dominated by illite, with less abundant kaolinite and chlorite and scarce smectite. The clay minerals display distinct differences in the tributaries and exhibit obvious changes in the trunk stream compared with the periods before 2003, and the source of sediment has largely shifted to the mid-to lower reaches of the river after 2003. Spatially, the clay mineral assemblages in the estuarine area define two compositionally distinct provinces. Province I covers the mud area of the Changjiang River estuary and the Zhe-Min coastal region, where sediment is primarily supplied by the Changjiang River. Province II includes part of the Changjiang River estuary and the southeastern portion of the study area, where the sediment is composed of terrestrial material from the Changjiang River and re-suspended material from the Huanghe River carried by the Jiangsu coastal current. Moreover, the other smaller rivers in China (including the Oujiang and Minjiang rivers of mainland China and the rivers of West Taiwan) also contribut sediments to the estuarine and inner shelf areas. In general, the clay mineral assemblages in the Changjiang River estuarine area are have mainly been controlled by sediment supplied from upstream of the Changjiang River tributaries. However, since the completion of the TGD in 2003, the mid-to downstream tributaries have become the main source of sediments from the Changjiang catchment into the East China Sea. These analyses further demonstrate that the coastal currents and the decrease in the sediment load of the river have the greatest impacts on the distribution and transport of clay minerals assemblages in the sediments.

AB In this study, luminescence dating of core sediments from the North Bohai Coast (China) was applied to provide a high-resolution chronological constraint, on a better understanding of the Holocene marine-terrestrial interaction. The studied sedimentary sequence contains a terrigenous deposit, a transgressive deposit and a pro grading deltaic succession; all are believed to have formed during the late Pleistocene. To establish a reliable luminescence chronology, the luminescence signals of ten samples were investigated in order to quantify the degree of bleaching. This approach involved the use of quartz OSL, K-feldspar infrared stimulated luminescence (IRSL) and post-IR IRSL (pIRIR) ages. The resulting data were then compared with radiocarbon ages. The quartz OSL signals were well-bleached for all the samples, and the feldspar pIRIR(150) and pIRIR(225) signals yielded reliable ages for the pre-Holocene deposits but overestimated ages for late Holocene deposits (< 1000 years). Radiocarbon data appeared to slightly overestimate the age of the young Holocene samples, therefore the chronological framework was established using quartz OSL ages. The early-mid Holocene transgressive deposits are relatively thin, which was attributed to the low-gradient relief and weak riverine fluvial input. Rapid deltaic progradation with high sedimentation rates over the last millennia, was revealed by the quartz OSL age results. This was supported by historical records for this section of the coastline. Episodic deposition around 700 years ago most likely triggered by frequent flooding events, was highlighted by the clustered OSL ages. While the sediment increment was 2.7 x 10(4) m(3) a(-1) for the period of similar to 6(-1) ka, this increased considerably to 9.1 x 10(6) m(3) a(-1) during the rapid progradation of the last millennium. The increase appears related to winter monsoon enhancement and human activity during the last 1000 years.

AB The Jigunsan Formation is the middle Ordovician shale-dominated transgressive succession in the Taebaeksan Basin, located in the eastern margin of the North China platform. The total organic carbon (TOC) content and some geochemical properties of the succession exhibit a stratigraphically distinct distribution pattern. The pattern was closely associated with the redox conditions related to decomposition, bulk sedimentation rate (dilution), and productivity. To explain the distinct distribution pattern, this study attempted to construct a high resolution sequence stratigraphic framework for the Jigunsan Formation. The shale-dominated Jigunsan Formation comprises a lower layer of dark gray shale, deposited during transgression, and an upper layer of greenish gray siltstone, deposited during highstand and falling stage systems tracts. The concept of a back stepped carbonate platform is adopted to distinguish early and late transgressive systems tracts (early and late TST) in this study, whereas the highstand systems tracts and falling stage systems tracts can be divided by changes in stacking patterns from aggradation to progradation. The late TST would be initiated on a rapidly back-stepping surface of sediments and, just above the surface, exhibits a high peak in TOC content, followed by a gradually upward decrease. This trend of TOC distribution in the late TST continues to the maximum flooding surface (MFS). The perplexing TOC distribution pattern within the late TST most likely resulted from both a gradual reduction in productivity during the late TST and a gradual increase in dilution effect near the MFS interval. The reduced production of organic matter primarily incurred decreasing TOC content toward the MFS when the productivity was mainly governed by benthic biota because planktonic organisms were not widespread in the Ordovician. Results of this study will help improve the understanding of the source rock distribution in mixed carbonate-siliciclastic successions within a stratigraphic framework, particularly for unconventional shale reservoirs.

AB Interpretation of multichannel seismic reflection data along the Mumbai Offshore Basin (MOB) revealed the tectonic processes that led to the development of sedimentary basins during Cenozoic evolution. Structural interpretation along three selected MCS profiles from MOB revealed seven major sedimentary sequences (similar to 3.0 s TWT, thick) and the associated complex fault patterns. These stratigraphic sequences are interpreted to host detritus of syn- to post rift events during rift-drift process. The acoustic basement appeared to be faulted with interspaced intrusive bodies. The sections also depicted the presence of slumping of sediments, subsidence, marginal basins, rollover anticlines, mud diapirs etc accompanied by normal to thrust faults related to recent tectonics. Presence of upthrusts in the slope region marks the locations of local compression during collision. Forward gravity modeling constrained with results from seismic and drill results, revealed that the crustal structure beneath the MOB has undergone an extensional type tectonics intruded with intrusive bodies. Results from the seismo-gravity modeling in association with litholog data from drilled wells from the western continental margin of India (WCMI) are presented here.

AB Science, technology and innovation (STI) policy is borne by a set of historically contingent concepts, models, and metaphors. From around 1950 to 1980, its language was dominated by the contract metaphor and the linear model of innovation, both of which have catered for beliefs in stability, orderliness, and distinct social roles for scientists and policymakers. While prominent new models of the 1990s (mode 2, post-normal science, triple helix) had challenged the old contract metaphor, they remained experts' brainchildren. After 2000, in contrast, we observe the emergence and pluralization of several new and powerful concepts. Building on conceptual history and cognitive linguistics, we analyze three of these new concepts: "frontier research," "grand challenges," and "responsible research and innovation" (RRI). Whereas the "frontier" and "grand challenges" convey many layered historical meanings, a distinct metaphorical appeal, and have become popularized beyond expert's communities, the RRI discourse, though the most ambitious one, has not yet shaken off its roots in the bureaucratic structures of the European Commission. Finally, we discuss which conceptual and metaphorical properties enable the career of STI policy discourses in the 21st century.

AB Greater understanding of how interdisciplinary research and education evolves is critical for identifying and implementing appropriate programme management strategies. In this paper a programme evaluation framework is presented. It is based on social learning processes (individual learning, interdisciplinary research practices, and interaction between researchers with different backgrounds); social capital outcomes (ability to interact, interpersonal connectivity, and shared understanding); and knowledge and human capital outcomes (new knowledge that integrates multiple research fields). The framework is illustrated on an established case study doctoral programme. Data are collected via mixed qualitative/quantitative methods to reveal several interesting findings about how interdisciplinary research evolves and can be supported. Firstly, different aspects of individual learning seem to contribute to a researcher's ability to interact with researchers from other research fields and work collaboratively. These include learning new material from different research fields, learning how to learn new material and learning how to integrate different material. Secondly, shared interdisciplinary research practices can be identified that may be common to other programmes and support interaction and shared understanding between different researchers. They include clarification and questioning, harnessing differences and setting defensible research boundaries. Thirdly, intensive interaction between researchers from different backgrounds support connectivity between the researchers, further enabling collaborative work. The case study data suggest that social learning processes and social capital outcomes precede new interdisciplinary research findings and are therefore a critical aspect to consider in interdisciplinary programme management.

AB This paper provides a novel interpretation of the factors leading to low performance in venture capital (VC) markets. By using human and social capital perspectives, we investigate the relationship between the professional experience and education of VC firm managers and i) the success of their portfolio firms on one hand and ii) their fundraising activity on the other. Our study focuses on the French VC market. The French business environment is characterized by tight links between businesses and the state and by powerful elite networks, while the VC industry has been dominated by government funding and incentives since the global financial crisis. We evidence a positive relationship between task-specific human capital variables and the exit success of VC-backed firms. However, unlike the research from the US market, we find no support for the claim that success determinants impact fundraising activity. Instead, we substantiate the importance of higher social networks for raising larger funds in markets with strong networks.

AB This paper presents the results of an exploration of factors influencing the organisation and conduct of academic research collaborations in Kenya. A mixed methods research design, involving 248 academics in four disciplines across four major public Kenyan universities, was employed. The study reveals a relatively high level of collaborative research which varies by disciplinary areas. Resource dependence emerged as having a strong influence on decisions to collaborate for this community. This was mainly attributed to low levels of investment in funding research, at both the institutional and national level. At the institutional level, inadequate policies, high levels of bureaucracy, competition among local institutions, weak links with industry, and a major focus on teaching as opposed to research, were reported as barriers to collaborative research. These contextual issues informed the resulting discussion of factors that affect collaborative research in Kenya.

AB Since the late 1990s, mergers have been pursued by a large number of national university systems. The mergers have been justified as a way of increasing research performance. This paper examines the impact of mergers on one vital measure of university research performance, the production of publications, for 29 Chinese university mergers and 8 Nordic university mergers. Using Web of Science counts of research articles before and after a merger while controlling for the university inputs of R & D funding and research personnel, it was found that Chinese universities exhibited a small but significant increase in the rate of growth of articles following a merger. The Nordic performance was less clear cut. Our findings support the belief that mergers of similarly sized institutions usually have little impact on research performance. In contrast, mergers between a large comprehensive university and much smaller universities have a positive impact on overall publications. We also show that cases in which the merger was between a comprehensive university and a medical school resulted in significantly improved performance in terms of scholarly publications. We attribute the improvement to synergies between the basic biological research in the comprehensive university and the more practical research under-taken in medical schools. We conclude with suggestions for policy-makers aiming to create synergies through mergers.

AB This study investigates how R & D subsidy and non-R & D subsidy affect entrepreneurial firms' initial public offering (IPO) performance in an emerging economy like China. Analyzing data from 269 IT (information technology) entrepreneurial firms in China, we found that R & D subsidy has an inverted U-shape effect on IPO performance, while non-R & D subsidy has a positive effect on IPO performance. Furthermore, both state ownership and patent intensity moderate the inverted U-shape relationship between R & D subsidy and IPO performance. In contrast, neither of them moderates the positive relationship between non-R & D subsidy and IPO performance. These findings contribute to the literature on the effectiveness of government subsidy by highlighting the symbolic effect of government subsidy on external financing in emerging economies, and offer important practical implications to entrepreneurial firms and government funding agencies in China.

AB According to the knowledge-spillovers theory of entrepreneurship (KSTE), local knowledge spillovers affect entrepreneurial dynamics, because of knowledge asymmetries and uncertainty. Most of the empirical literature has tested this hypothesis using a measure of local knowledge stock. This paper is aimed at extending the framework by showing that the domains over which local knowledge spans are also important. The paper investigates the impact of the configuration of local knowledge bases on new firm formation dynamics by combining the KSTE framework with the recombinant knowledge approach. Local knowledge bases emerge from the combination of different knowledge inputs. These inputs may be closely or loosely related to one another. Technological differentiation and the relatedness degree of local competences can be interpreted as characteristics of the local knowledge base interacting with the knowledge filter and the entrepreneurial absorptive capacity. The paper proposes a taxonomy of regional modes of knowledge production and investigates new firm formation in 92 Italian NUTS 3 regions observed over the 1995-2009 time span. The results confirm that the availability of local knowledge pools is important, and show that the 'rich integration' mode is the configuration that favours the entrepreneurial process. Finally, the policy implications and avenues for further research are presented and discussed.

AB This study explores the initial public offering (IPO) and financing of biotechnology start-ups in Japan. Using a unique data set, we find that biotechnology start-ups initially backed by venture capital (VC) firms and those originating from universities are more likely to go public within a shorter period. Moreover, we find that neither staged financing nor syndication by VC firms is associated with higher IPO value relative to investment. Furthermore, we provide evidence that the timing of IPOs does not depend on equity market conditions in the biotechnology industry, whereas IPO value tends to depend on equity market conditions. We discuss the factors that explain these findings, which contradict findings in previous studies of VC investments.

TI Unintended consequences on gender diversity of high-tech growth and
   labor market polarization
SO RESEARCH POLICY

ID HIGH-TECHNOLOGY EMPLOYMENT; JOB POLARIZATION; WAGE INEQUALITY
AB There has been considerable media coverage highlighting the lack of gender diversity in Silicon Valley, stressing the relatively low participation of women in the high-tech economy. Austin offers a unique case for testing whether similar gender issues characterized other high-tech regions because the city has historically benefited from the expansion of Silicon Valley's large high-tech firms since the 1980s. The gender-biased business practices identified in Silicon Valley firms may have been transferred to their branch plants in Austin. Our analysis shows women's losses in middle-skill occupation employment shares were concentrated in the low-tech industry and were partially offset by job share gains in high-skill occupations in the same sector between 1980 and 2015. Men's losses in middle-skill occupation job share were also mainly concentrated in the low-tech sector but were partially offset by employment share gains in high-skill occupations only in the high-tech industry during this period. Women made large gains in relative real median wages only in high-skill occupations in the high-tech industry while their relative real median wages in other skill occupations and in the low-tech industry stagnated around zero during this period. Men's gains in relative median wages were also concentrated only in the high-tech industry but were less than half of women's and were negative (between 10 and 21 percent) in other occupations in the high-tech industry and across all occupations in the low-tech industry. As noted in previous studies, the impact of job polarization is not well understood across sectors and gender. This study finds the high-tech industry in Austin has had unintended consequences in terms of job polarization across gender, providing relatively fewer job opportunities in high-skill occupations to women than men but offering much higher gains in relative real median wages to women than men. Males also found relatively more job opportunities in high-skill occupations in the high-tech industry than women but experienced only half of women's gains in relative median wages in this industry between 1980 and 2015.

AB Although prior research conceptualizes how knowledge-seeking motivates the internationalization of emerging market enterprises (EMEs), whether outward foreign direct investment (OFDI) indeed leads to enhanced innovation performance has received limited attention. We address this subject by conceptualizing how Chinese EMEs' OFDI enhances their subsidiaries' organizational learning and innovation performance and whether geographic location choices influence this relationship. Our panel data analysis of Chinese EMEs shows that OFDI has a positive effect on innovation performance of Chinese EMEs' subsidiaries and that this effect is stronger when the OFDI is directed towards developed rather than emerging countries. These findings advance the notion that EMEs can use OFDI as a strategy to globalize R&D and enhance their innovation performance and demonstrate that certain established assumptions regarding organizational learning are not valid for EMEs.

AB A major proportion of the world's population will be located in cities by 2030. With cities globally facing challenges due to the social exclusion of significant proportions of their populace, new thinking is needed on ways to correlate the competing socio-economic goals of various actors. This study sought to uncover the link between governance in cities as an innovation process and socio-economic regime transition towards a more equitable urban society. To do so, we draw on transition management thinking to consider urban regime transitions evolving in a temporal and incremental manner and in a multi-level context. We sought expansion from a delimited focus on socio-technical regimes in transition management literature to incorporate the notion of urban socio-economic regimes. This involved integrating aspects of reflexive governance and politics in a city context with a basic ontology of complex social systems and their evolutionary dynamics that underlies transition management approaches. Our focus is on learning by doing and experimentation as well as participation of citizens with other key city actors in a radically new process of mutual learning that creates social inclusion. The juxtaposition of national, city and community level interactions and their impact on socio-economic regime transition brings into sharp relief the issue of spatial scale and a lack of consideration in transition approaches generally. The study findings reveal a spatial orientation for creating new urban forms of reflexive governance as an innovation process taking place in transition arenas that can trigger new pathways to socio-economic change.

ID SEARCH; IMPACT; LANDSCAPE; RENEWAL; GROWTH
AB I develop a model of innovation where new technologies are combinations of pre-existing technological components. The model captures two opposing forces. The best ideas are used up (knowledge is exhaustible). However, as firms learn which technologies can be combined, new ideas become feasible (knowledge accumulates). I test the model with more than 80 years of US patent data. Technological components are proxied by 13,517 patent office technology classifications. These are reused and recycled in 10,000 distinct three-component sets. Consistent with a learning/fishing-out dynamic, I show patenting in one set of components is correlated with a subsequent increase in similar patents (sharing two of three components), but a subsequent decrease in identical patents (sharing all three components). I use patent renewal data to show my results are not driven by changes in demand for various technology bundles. My results suggest the positive impact of learning on subsequent patenting is larger than the negative impact of fishing out.

AB Academics are increasingly expected to produce concrete and directly applicable solutions to hard-to-solve 'real world problems' such as poverty, development, and environmental degradation. However, conventional assessments of the impact of science on society have not yet been adequately adapted to capture the diverse effects of this type of problem-centred research. Drawing on a case study of a large-scale project on (un)sustainable consumption, this paper demonstrates the range, complexity and potential long-term nature of impact in interdisciplinary sustainability research. It thus supports arguments for alternative approaches to impact assessment that question conventional views of translating scientific knowledge into action, value the multi-directionality of science-society relations and recognise diverse forms of engagement between scientists and non-scientific actors through non-academic channels and outputs. The paper also challenges common (mis)conceptions of work practices in a university context by demonstrating the highly innovative and inclusive nature of much sustainability research that seeks to address the needs of diverse communities of actors. It is argued that only radically different ways of conceptualising and measuring short-, medium- and long-term impacts can capture the success or otherwise of social-scientific and interdisciplinary sustainability research.

AB As it becomes apparent that users are an important source in innovation in society and in organizations, scholars are realizing that user-directed innovation policy might contribute to improving social welfare. How such policy might be designed, however, is uncertain, as are the costs and benefits of such policies. It is also not clear whether there is a problem for user-directed policy to solve, or what that problem is.
   As a first empirical step to answering these questions, we report the results of providing hospital clinicians with access to 'makerspaces', i.e. staffed facilities with prototyping tools and the expertise in using them.
   Findings suggest that almost all innovations developed in the makerspaces are user innovations; that the potential returns from the innovations developed in the makerspaces' first year of operation are more than tenfold the required investment; and that most of the innovations would not have been developed without access to makerspaces. Due to lack of diffusion, only a limited share of potential returns is realized.
   This suggests not only that there are problems of non-development and under-development that policy can solve and that doing so supports social welfare. It also suggests makerspaces as an effective form of user-supporting innovation policy.

AB As job markets have been polarizing, firms have been changing their labor inputs. By using matched employer employee data for Portugal, we examine whether labor market polarization has occurred within or across firms and how labor input upgrades have contributed to overall productivity growth. We develop a firm taxonomy based on worker's occupational data. Firms can be focused on one task Abstract, Manual or Routine on a combination of tasks, or none. Results show that Abstract firms are the most productive and their share has increased over time. Manual firms, the least productive, have had a stable share throughout the period. Routine firms have seen their share decline over time. The dynamic decomposition of the estimated productivity reveals that productivity growth is propelled by increased market shares of the most productive incumbents and exiting of the least productive, especially for Abstract firms. Notwithstanding these productivity growth drivers, they fail to avert the productivity stagnation observed in Portugal between 2004 and 2009 due to the overall decline in productivity of incumbent firms, especially Routine. We discuss the policy implications of our results which are relevant to other European economies also lagging behind in terms of knowledge and innovation capabilities.

AB This study investigates four different sourcing strategies employed by firms in order to successfully deal with a new architectural innovation hitting the market. The four sourcing approaches reflect the varying degrees of internalization of component design and manufacturing: make, in-house design, long-term supplier, and "new supplier, where make implies the highest and new supplier the lowest degree of internalization of the firm's component sourcing in a spectrum. Comparing and contrasting the innovation performance of the four sourcing approaches in the pre- and post-dominant design eras, we suggest theoretical implications for the critical path of strategic sourcing decisions over time for a new architectural innovation. By doing so, we suggest an integrated framework of stage-contingent sourcing strategies and provide the associated empirical results that demonstrate normative strategic guidance for managers.

AB Hourglassing is a well-known pathological numerical artifact affecting the robustness and accuracy of Lagrangian methods. There exist a large number of hourglass control/suppression strategies. In the community of the staggered compatible Lagrangian methods, the approach of sub-zonal pressure forces is among the most widely used. However, this approachis known to add numerical strength to the solution, which can cause potential problems in certain types of simulations, for instance in simulations of various instabilities. To avoid this complication, we have adapted the multi-scale residual-based stabilization typically used in the finite element approach for staggered compatible framework. In this paper, we describe two discretizations of the new approach and demonstrate their properties and compare with the method of sub-zonal pressure forces on selected numerical problems.

AB We solve the wave equation with variable wave speed on nonconforming domains with fourth order accuracy in both space and time. This is accomplished using an implicit finite difference (FD) scheme for the wave equation and solving an elliptic (modified Helmholtz) equation at each time step with fourth order spatial accuracy by the method of difference potentials (MDP). High-order MDP utilizes compact FD schemes on regular structured grids to efficiently solve problems on nonconforming domains while maintaining the design convergence rate of the underlying FD scheme. Asymptotically, the computational complexity of high-order MDP scales the same as that for FD. (c) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB In this paper, we consider a variable-separation (VS) method to solve the stochastic saddle point (SSP) problems. The VS method is applied to obtain the solution in tensor product structure for stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs) in a mixed formulation. The aim of such a technique is to construct a reduced basis approximation of the solution of the SSP problems. The VS method attempts to get a low rank separated representation of the solution for SSP in a systematic enrichment manner. No iteration is performed at each enrichment step. In order to satisfy the inf-sup condition in the mixed formulation, we enrich the separated terms for the primal system variable at each enrichment step. For the SSP problems by regularization or penalty, we propose a more efficient variable-separation (VS) method, i.e., the variable-separation by penalty method. This can avoid further enrichment of the separated terms in the original mixed formulation. The computation of the variable-separation method decomposes into offline phase and online phase. Sparse low rank tensor approximation method is used to significantly improve the online computation efficiency when the number of separated terms is large. For the applications of SSP problems, we present three numerical examples to illustrate the performance of the proposed methods. (c) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB In this paper we propose a third order accurate finite volume scheme based on a posteriori limiting of polynomial reconstructions within an Adaptive-Mesh-Refinement (AMR) simulation code for hydrodynamics equations in 2D. The a posteriori limiting is based on the detection of problematic cells on a so-called candidate solution computed at each stage of a third order Runge-Kutta scheme. Such detection may include different properties, derived from physics, such as positivity, from numerics, such as a non-oscillatory behavior, or from computer requirements such as the absence of NaN's. Troubled cell values are discarded and re-computed starting again from the previous time-step using a more dissipative scheme but only locally, close to these cells. By locally decrementing the degree of the polynomial reconstructions from 2 to 0 we switch from a third-order to a first-order accurate but more stable scheme. The entropy indicator sensor is used to refine/coarsen the mesh. This sensor is also employed in an a posteriori manner because if some refinement is needed at the end of a time step, then the current time-step is recomputed with the refined mesh, but only locally, close to the new cells. We show on a large set of numerical tests that this a posteriori limiting procedure coupled with the entropy-based AMR technology can maintain not only optimal accuracy on smooth flows but also stability on discontinuous profiles such as shock waves, contacts, interfaces, etc. Moreover numerical evidences show that this approach is at least comparable in terms of accuracy and cost to a more classical CWENO approach within the same AMR context.

AB The discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method has found widespread application in elliptic problems with rough coefficients, of which the Darcy flow equations are a prototypical example. One of the long-standing issues of DG approximations is the overall computational cost, and many different strategies have been proposed, such as the variational multiscale DG method, the hybridizable DG method, the multiscale DG method, the embedded DG method, and the Enriched Galerkin method. In this work, we propose a mixed dual-scale Galerkin method, in which the degrees-of-freedom of a less computationally expensive coarse-scale approximation are linked to the degrees-of-freedom of a base DG approximation. We show that the proposed approach has always similar or improved accuracy with respect to the base DG method, with a considerable reduction in computational cost. For the specific definition of the coarse-scale space, we consider Raviart-Thomas finite elements for the mass flux and piecewise-linear continuous finite elements for the pressure. We provide a complete analysis of stability and convergence of the proposed method, in addition to a study on its conservation and consistency properties. We also present a battery of numerical tests to verify the results of the analysis, and evaluate a number of possible variations, such as using piecewise-linear continuous finite elements for the coarse-scale mass fluxes.

AB In this paper we propose a method for the strong imposition of random Dirichlet boundary conditions in the Dynamical Low Rank (DLR) approximation of parabolic PDEs and, in particular, incompressible Navier Stokes equations. We show that the DLR variational principle can be set in the constrained manifold of all S rank random fields with a prescribed value on the boundary, expressed in low rank format, with rank smaller then S. We characterize the tangent space to the constrained manifold by means of a Dual Dynamically Orthogonal (Dual DO) formulation, in which the stochastic modes are kept orthonormal and the deterministic modes satisfy suitable boundary conditions, consistent with the original problem. The Dual DO formulation is also convenient to include the incompressibility constraint, when dealing with incompressible Navier Stokes equations. We show the performance of the proposed Dual DO approximation on two numerical test cases: the classical benchmark of a laminar flow around a cylinder with random inflow velocity, and a biomedical application for simulating blood flow in realistic carotid artery reconstructed from MRI data with random inflow conditions coming from Doppler measurements.

AB The Flux-Corrected Transport (FCT) algorithm is applied to the unsteady and steady-state particle transport equation. The proposed FCT method employs the following: (1) a low-order, positivity-preserving scheme, based on the application of M-matrix properties, (2) a high-order scheme based on the entropy viscosity method introduced by Guermond [1], and (3) local, discrete solution bounds derived from the integral transport equation. The resulting scheme is second-order accurate in space, enforces an entropy inequality, mitigates the formation of spurious oscillations, and guarantees the absence of negativities. Space discretization is achieved using continuous finite elements. Time discretizations for unsteady problems include theta schemes such as explicit and implicit Euler, and strong-stability preserving Runge-Kutta (SSPRK) methods. The developed FCT scheme is shown to be robust with explicit time discretizations but may require damping in the nonlinear iterations for steady-state and implicit time discretizations.

AB Concentration organization and dynamics in heterogeneous porous media are key physical factors driving chemical reactivity. At equilibrium, reactivity depends not only on the concentration distribution but also on concentration gradients. As high and low values of concentration and concentration gradient do not superpose, we derive a transport equation for the concentration gradients and set up an adapted particle method to approach them numerically. Particles dynamically optimize their organization to provide highly accurate concentration gradients. The global strategy combining separate particle methods for the concentration and its gradient gives optimal predictions of reactivity. (c) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB In this paper, we are interested in the resolution of the time-dependent problem of particle transport in a medium whose composition evolves with time due to interactions. As a constraint, we want to use of Monte-Carlo (MC) scheme for the transport phase. A common resolution strategy consists in a splitting between the MC/transport phase and the time discretization scheme/medium evolution phase. After going over and illustrating the main drawbacks of split solvers in a simplified configuration (monokinetic, scalar Bateman problem), we build a new Unsplit MC (UMC) solver improving the accuracy of the solutions, avoiding numerical instabilities, and less sensitive to time discretization. The new solver is essentially based on a Monte Carlo scheme with time dependent cross sections implying the on-the-fly resolution of a reduced model for each MC particle describing the time evolution of the matter along their flight path.

AB Solving the Fokker-Planck equation for high-dimensional complex turbulent dynamical systems is an important and practical issue. However, most traditional methods suffer from the curse of dimensionality and have difficulties in capturing the fat tailed highly intermittent probability density functions (PDFs) of complex systems in turbulence, neuroscience and excitable media. In this article, efficient statistically accurate algorithms are developed for solving both the transient and the equilibrium solutions of Fokker-Planck equations associated with high-dimensional nonlinear turbulent dynamical systems with conditional Gaussian structures. The algorithms involve a hybrid strategy that requires only a small number of ensembles. Here, a conditional Gaussian mixture in a high-dimensional subspace via an extremely efficient parametric method is combined with a judicious non-parametric Gaussian kernel density estimation in the remaining low-dimensional subspace. Particularly, the parametric method provides closed analytical formulae for determining the conditional Gaussian distributions in the high-dimensional subspace and is therefore computationally efficient and accurate. The full non-Gaussian PDF of the system is then given by a Gaussian mixture. Different from traditional particle methods, each conditional Gaussian distribution here covers a significant portion of the high-dimensional PDF. Therefore a small number of ensembles is sufficient to recover the full PDF, which overcomes the curse of dimensionality. Notably, the mixture distribution has significant skill in capturing the transient behavior with fat tails of the high-dimensional non-Gaussian PDFs, and this facilitates the algorithms in accurately describing the intermittency and extreme events in complex turbulent systems. It is shown in a stringent set of test problems that the method only requires an order of O(100) ensembles to successfully recover the highly non-Gaussian transient PDFs in up to 6 dimensions with only small errors.

AB A meshless approach to approximating spatial derivatives on scattered point arrangements is presented in this paper. Three various derivations of approximate discrete Laplace operator formulations are produced using the Taylor series expansion and renormalised least-squares correction of the first spatial derivatives. Numerical analyses are performed for the introduced Laplacian formulations, and their convergence rate and computational efficiency are examined. The tests are conducted on regular and highly irregular scattered point arrangements. The results are compared to those obtained by the smoothed particle hydrodynamics method and the finite differences method on a regular grid. Finally, the strong form of various Poisson and diffusion equations with Dirichlet or Robin boundary conditions are solved in two and three dimensions by making use of the introduced operators in order to examine their stability and accuracy for boundary value problems. The introduced Laplacian operators perform well for highly irregular point distribution and offer adequate accuracy for mesh and mesh-free numerical methods that require frequent movement of the grid or point cloud.

AB We show how auction algorithms, originally developed for the assignment problem, can be utilized in Merriman, Bence, and Osher's threshold dynamics scheme to simulate multi-phase motion by mean curvature in the presence of equality and inequality volume constraints on the individual phases. The resulting algorithms are highly efficient and robust, and can be used in simulations ranging from minimal partition problems in Euclidean space to semi-supervised machine learning via clustering on graphs. In the case of the latter application, numerous experimental results on benchmark machine learning datasets show that our approach exceeds the performance of current state-of-the-art methods, while requiring a fraction of the computation time.

AB In this work, the time-marching reinitialization method is extended to compute the unsigned distance function in multi-region systems involving arbitrary number of regions. High order and interface preservation are achieved by applying a simple mapping that transforms the regional level-set function to the level-set function and a high-order two-step reinitialization method which is a combination of the closest point finding procedure and the HJ-WENO scheme. The convergence failure of the closest point finding procedure in three dimensions is addressed by employing a proposed multiple junction treatment and a directional optimization algorithm. Simple test cases show that our method exhibits 4th-order accuracy for reinitializing the regional level-set functions and strictly satisfies the interface-preserving property. The reinitialization results for more complex cases with randomly generated diagrams show the capability our method for arbitrary number of regions N, with a computational effort independent of N. The proposed method has been applied to dynamic interfaces with different types of flows, and the results demonstrate high accuracy and robustness. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

ID MODIFIED EQUATIONS
AB A common way to simulate the transport and spread of pollutants in the atmosphere is via stochastic Lagrangian dispersion models. Mathematically, these models describe turbulent transport processes with stochastic differential equations (SDEs). The computational bottleneck is the Monte Carlo algorithm, which simulates the motion of a large number of model particles in a turbulent velocity field; for each particle, a trajectory is calculated with a numerical timestepping method. Choosing an efficient numerical method is particularly important in operational emergency-response applications, such as tracking radioactive clouds from nuclear accidents or predicting the impact of volcanic ash clouds on international aviation, where accurate and timely predictions are essential. In this paper, we investigate the application of the Multilevel Monte Carlo (MLMC) method to simulate the propagation of particles in a representative one-dimensional dispersion scenario in the atmospheric boundary layer. MLMC can be shown to result in asymptotically superior computational complexity and reduced computational cost when compared to the Standard Monte Carlo (StMC) method, which is currently used in atmospheric dispersion modelling. To reduce the absolute cost of the method also in the non-asymptotic regime, it is equally important to choose the best possible numerical timestepping method on each level. To investigate this, we also compare the standard symplectic Euler method, which is used in many operational models, with two improved timestepping algorithms based on SDE splitting methods.

AB In this paper, we develop a new tensor-product based preconditioner for discontinuous Galerkin methods with polynomial degrees higher than those typically employed. This preconditioner uses an automatic, purely algebraic method to approximate the exact block Jacobi preconditioner by Kronecker products of several small, one-dimensional matrices. Traditional matrix-based preconditioners require O(p(2d)) storage and O(p(3d)) computational work, where pis the degree of basis polynomials used, and dis the spatial dimension. Our SVD-based tensor-product preconditioner requires O(p(d+1)) storage, O(p(d+1)) work in two spatial dimensions, and O(p(d+2)) work in three spatial dimensions. Combined with a matrix-free Newton-Krylov solver, these preconditioners allow for the solution of DG systems in linear time in p per degree of freedom in 2D, and reduce the computational complexity from O(p(9)) to O(p(5)) in 3D. Numerical results are shown in 2D and 3D for the advection, Euler, and Navier-Stokes equations, using polynomials of degree up to p = 30. For many test cases, the preconditioner results in similar iteration counts when compared with the exact block Jacobi preconditioner, and performance is significantly improved for high polynomial degrees p.

AB We present a randomized iterative method for approximating unknown function sequentially on arbitrary point set. The method is based on a recently developed sequential approximation (SA) method, which approximates a target function using one data point at each step and avoids matrix operations. The focus of this paper is on data sets with highly irregular distribution of the points. We present a nearest neighbor replacement (NNR) algorithm, which allows one to sample the irregular data sets in a near optimal manner. We provide mathematical justification and error estimates for the NNR algorithm. Extensive numerical examples are also presented to demonstrate that the NNR algorithm can deliver satisfactory convergence for the SA method on data sets with high irregularity in their point distributions.

AB Progress in the development of coupled atomistic-continuum methods for simulations of critical dynamic material behavior has been hampered by a spurious wave reflection problem at the atomistic-continuum interface. This problem is mainly caused by the difference in material descriptions between the atomistic and continuum models, which results in a mismatch in phonon dispersion relations. In this work, we introduce a new method based on atomistic dynamics of lattice coupled with a concurrent atomistic-continuum method to enable a full phonon representation in the continuum description. This permits the passage of short-wavelength, high-frequency phonon waves from the atomistic to continuum regions. The benchmark examples presented in this work demonstrate that the new scheme enables the passage of all allowable phonons through the atomistic-continuum interface; it also preserves the wave coherency and energy conservation after phonons transport across multiple atomistic-continuum interfaces. This work is the first step towards developing a concurrent atomistic-continuum simulation tool for non-equilibrium phonon-mediated thermal transport in materials with microstructural complexity.

AB We present a fast and efficient Fourier-based solver for the Poisson problem around an arbitrary geometry in an unbounded 3D domain. This solver merges two rewarding approaches, the lattice Green's function method and the immersed interface method, using the Sherman-Morrison-Woodbury decomposition formula. The method is intended to be second order up to the boundary. This is verified on two potential flow benchmarks. We also further analyse the iterative process and the convergence behavior of the proposed algorithm. The method is applicable to a wide range of problems involving a Poisson equation around inner bodies, which goes well beyond the present validation on potential flows. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

AB A computational tool for coarse-graining nonlinear systems of ordinary differential equations in time is discussed. Three illustrative model examples are worked out that demonstrate the range of capability of the method. This includes the averaging of Hamiltonian as well as dissipative microscopic dynamics whose 'slow' variables, defined in a precise sense, can often display mixed slow-fast response as in relaxation oscillations, and dependence on initial conditions of the fast variables. Also covered is the case where the quasi-static assumption in solid mechanics is violated. The computational tool is demonstrated to capture all of these behaviors in an accurate and robust manner, with significant savings in time. Apractically useful strategy for accurately initializing short bursts of microscopic runs for the evolution of slow variables is integral to our scheme, without the requirement that the slow variables determine a unique invariant measure of the microscopic dynamics.

AB Sensitivity analysis methods are important tools for research and design with simulations. Many important simulations exhibit chaotic dynamics, including scale-resolving turbulent fluid flow simulations. Unfortunately, conventional sensitivity analysis methods are unable to compute useful gradient information for long-time-averaged quantities in chaotic dynamical systems. Sensitivity analysis with least squares shadowing (LSS) can compute useful gradient information for a number of chaotic systems, including simulations of chaotic vortex shedding and homogeneous isotropic turbulence. However, this gradient information comes at a very high computational cost. This paper presents multiple shooting shadowing (MSS), a more computationally efficient shadowing approach than the original LSS approach. Through an analysis of the convergence rate of MSS, it is shown that MSS can have lower memory usage and run time than LSS. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Several multiscale methods account for sub-grid scale features using coarse scale basis functions. For example, in the Multiscale Finite Volume method the coarse scale basis functions are obtained by solving a set of local problems over dual-grid cells. We introduce a data-driven approach for the estimation of these coarse scale basis functions. Specifically, we employ a neural network predictor fitted using a set of solution samples from which it learns to generate subsequent basis functions at a lower computational cost than solving the local problems. The computational advantage of this approach is realized for uncertainty quantification tasks where a large number of realizations has to be evaluated. Weattribute the ability to learn these basis functions to the modularity of the local problems and the redundancy of the permeability patches between samples. The proposed method is evaluated on elliptic problems yielding very promising results. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB In this paper, we develop a high order semi-Lagrangian (SL) discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method for nonlinear Vlasov-Poisson (VP) simulations without operator splitting. In particular, we combine two recently developed novel techniques: one is the high order non-splitting SLDG transport method (Cai et al. (2017) [4]), and the other is the high order characteristics tracing technique proposed in Qiu and Russo (2017) [29]. The proposed method with up to third order accuracy in both space and time is locally mass conservative, free of splitting error, positivity-preserving, stable and robust for large time stepping size. The SLDG VP solver is applied to classic benchmark test problems such as Landau damping and two-stream instabilities for VP simulations. Efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed scheme is extensively tested. Tremendous CPU savings are shown by comparisons between the proposed SL DG scheme and the classical Runge-Kutta DG method.

AB While smoothed-particle hydrodynamics (SPH) simulations are usually performed using uniform particle distributions, local particle refinement techniques have been developed to concentrate fine spatial resolutions in identified areas of interest. Although the formalism of this method is relatively easy to implement, its robustness at coarse/fine interfaces can be problematic. Analysis performed in [16] shows that the radius of refined particles should be greater than half the radius of unrefined particles to ensure robustness. In this article, the basics of an Adaptive Particle Refinement (APR) technique, inspired by AMR in mesh-based methods, are presented. This approach ensures robustness with alleviated constraints. Simulations applying the new formalism proposed achieve accuracy comparable to fully refined spatial resolutions, together with robustness, low CPU times and maintained parallel efficiency.

AB One of the key research topics in the computational fluid dynamics community is to improve the computational efficiency of steady-state finite volume codes. Real-world use cases require the solution to the Navier-Stokes equations for a wide range of Mach numbers, Reynolds numbers and mesh cell aspect ratios. This introduces stiffness in the discretised equations and therefore a slowdown in convergence. The community has pursued in particular two avenues to speed up the convergence of the corresponding error modes: Optimisation of Runge-Kutta coefficients for explicit Runge-Kutta schemes; and the introduction of implicit preconditioners, with a limited investigation of Runge-Kutta coefficients suitable to those implicit preconditioners. After proposing improvements to the implicit preconditioner, the present work proposes an optimisation procedure allowing the optimisation of the Runge-Kutta coefficients specifically for the implicit preconditioner. Employed on a realistic use case, the Runge-Kutta coefficients extracted with this method show a 20%-38% reduction of the number of iterations needed for convergence compared to Runge-Kutta coefficients recommended in the literature for comparable schemes and with the same computational cost per iteration.

AB This paper presents the algebraic dynamic multilevel method (ADM) for compositional flow in three dimensional heterogeneous porous media in presence of capillary and gravitational effects. As a significant advancement compared to the ADM for immiscible flows (Cusini et al., 2016) [33], here, mass conservation equations are solved along with k-value based thermodynamic equilibrium equations using a fully-implicit (FIM) coupling strategy. Two different fine-scale compositional formulations are considered: (1) the natural variables and (2) the overall-compositions formulation. At each Newton's iteration the fine-scale FIM Jacobian system is mapped to a dynamically defined (in space and time) multilevel nested grid. The appropriate grid resolution is chosen based on the contrast of user-defined fluid properties and on the presence of specific features (e.g., well source terms). Consistent mapping between different resolutions is performed by the means of sequences of restriction and prolongation operators. While finite-volume restriction operators are employed to ensure mass conservation at all resolutions, various prolongation operators are considered. In particular, different interpolation strategies can be used for the different primary variables, and multiscale basis functions are chosen as pressure interpolators so that fine scale heterogeneities are accurately accounted for across different resolutions. Several numerical experiments are conducted to analyse the accuracy, efficiency and robustness of the method for both 2D and 3D domains. Results show that ADM provides accurate solutions by employing only a fraction of the number of grid-cells employed in fine-scale simulations. As such, it presents a promising approach for large-scale simulations of multiphase flow in heterogeneous reservoirs with complex non-linear fluid physics. (c) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The study of Multiphase Fluid Structure Interaction (MFSI) is becoming of great interest in many engineering applications. In this work we propose a new algorithm for coupling a FSI problem to a multiphase interface advection problem. An unstructured computational grid and a Cartesian mesh are used for the FSI and the VOF problem, respectively. The coupling between these two different grids is obtained by interpolating the velocity field into the Cartesian grid through a projection operator that can take into account the natural movement of the FSI domain. The piecewise color function is interpolated back on the unstructured grid with a Galerkin interpolation to obtain a point-wise function which allows the direct computation of the surface tension forces.

AB We present a robust sharp-interface immersed boundary method for numerically studying high speed flows of compressible and viscous fluids interacting with arbitrarily shaped either stationary or moving rigid solids. The Navier-Stokes equations are discretized on a rectangular Cartesian grid based on a low-diffusion flux splitting method for inviscid fluxes and conservative high-order central-difference schemes for the viscous components. Discontinuities such as those introduced by shock waves and contact surfaces are captured by using a high-resolution weighted essentially non-oscillatory (WENO) scheme. Ghost cells in the vicinity of the fluid-solid interface are introduced to satisfy boundary conditions on the interface. Values of variables in the ghost cells are found by using a constrained moving least squares method (CMLS) that eliminates numerical instabilities encountered in the conventional MLS formulation. The solution of the fluid flow and the solid motion equations is advanced in time by using the third-order Runge-Kutta and the implicit Newmark integration schemes, respectively. The performance of the proposed method has been assessed by computing results for the following four problems: shock-boundary layer interaction, supersonic viscous flows past a rigid cylinder, moving piston in a shock tube and lifting off from a flat surface of circular, rectangular and elliptic cylinders triggered by shock waves, and comparing computed results with those available in the literature.

AB This paper presents the implementation and validation of a remeshed Vortex Particle-Mesh (VPM) method capable of simulating complex compressible and viscous flows. It is supplemented with a radiation boundary condition in order for the method to accommodate the radiating quantities of the flow. The efficiency of the methodology relies on the use of an underlying grid; it allows the use of a FFT-based Poisson solver to calculate the velocity field, and the use of high-order isotropic finite differences to evaluate the non-advective terms in the Lagrangian form of the conservation equations. The Mohring analogy is then also used to further obtain the far-field sound produced by two co-rotating Gaussian vortices. It is demonstrated that the method is in excellent quantitative agreement with reference results that were obtained using a high-order Eulerian method and using a highorder remeshed Vortex Particle (VP) method.

AB In this work, we proposed a new method to prepare graphene nanosheets. Expand graphite has large sheet spacing and oil absorption, and the self-combustion precursor of BaFe12O19 is oily gel. It means that the BaFe12O19 oily gel can enter between the layers of expand graphite. When BaFe12O19 oily gel is self combusted to form BaFe12O19 particles, it has a significant increase in volume. Expand graphite will occur secondary expansion and be peeled into graphene nanosheets. We characterized it by several ways and this is a time-saving, convenient, and low-cost method.

ID ENUCLEATION
AB Surgical removal of a diseased ocular globe is followed by the placement of a permanent orbital implant in the patient's anophthalmic cavity to provide adequate support to surrounding tissues. We fabricated foam-like CaSiO3-containing glass-ceramics that exhibited favorable micro-architectural characteristics for use as orbital implant materials, i.e. a network of open and large macropores (similar to 250 mu m) that could potentially allow ingrowth of fibrovascular tissue. The implants had an excellent chemical stability in contact with simulated body fluids (no mass losses were registered after soaking for 1 month in vitro) and high mechanical strength (similar to 20 MPa under compression) to permit safe manipulation during surgery. Therefore, this new glass-ceramic porous material is a promising, potentially less expensive alternative to existing polymeric or ceramic bioinert orbital implants. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB Herein, the phosphate glasses containing 0-2 mol% nickel oxide were prepared by melt-quenching technology. The structural and magneto-optical properties were investigated. The results show that the NiO doped phosphate glass is composed of a three-dimensional network structure formed by different types of phosphate groups, and exhibits obvious amorphous characteristic. The addition of NiO has no distinct effect on the network structure of glass, but the absorption peaks of attributed to d-orbital electron transition appear in the UV-visible spectrum. The Verdet constant measured at 632.8 nm shows a positive correlation with NiO concentration. When the content of NiO up to 2 mol%, the Verdet constant is 55.5 degrees/T cm, which is 18 times higher than that of the host glass approximately. This means a potential to cover the increasing demand for new and improve Faraday rotators. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In this paper, Si3N4 nanowires (SNWs) were successfully prepared by directly nitriding Si powders and firstly applied as an efficient photocatalyst for the degradation of antibiotic residues. Comparing with commercial Si3N4 powder (SNPs), the prepared SNWs demonstrate enhanced photocatalytic activity for tetracycline hydrochloride (TC-HCl) photodegradation under UV-vis light with good stability. The improved photocatalytic performance should come from its unique morphology and small size. The synthesis and application of Si3N4 nanowires in removing antibiotic residue may contribute to development of newly efficient photocatalyst for environmental issues. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB In quasi-one-dimensional polar nanostructures the relative orientation of the long and polar axes will determine how the polarity of the nanostructure may be exploited for applications. Here we present the growth by molecular-beam epitaxy of quasi-1d ZnO nanostructures (specifically nanobelts) with the polar axis perpendicular to the growth axis. We demonstrate the control of nanostructure morphology by growth temperature. Our work represents a key milestone towards the development of future polarization-engineered oxide heterostructures embedded in quasi-1d nanodevices. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB ZnO nanoparticles (NPs) have been widely studied as bacteriostatic reagents. In this work, ZnO NPs were loaded within carboxymethyl chitosan (CMCS) to prepare CMCS/ZnO nanocomposite microspheres by spray drying. The analysis showed that CMCS/ZnO microspheres with a diameter of 1-6 mu m was notably as effective antibacterial activity as pure ZnO NPs in a dose dependent manner. Flow cytometry data supported CMCS/ZnO microspheres had half significantly less than pure ZnO NPs of cell apoptosis in the same concentration of ZnO. The study additionally presented that the chelating effect of chitosan on metal ions improved the biocompatibility of CMCS/ZnO microspheres. In one word, the present research will shed new light on the fabrication of anti-bacterial nanomaterials such as ZnO NPs with enhanced biocompatibility and efficient antibacterial property by a simple and cost-effective way.

AB Microporous zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs) have shown great potential in many application fields. However, the small dimensions of ZIF nanoparticles make them difficult to employ in practical systems. To overcome this problem, a novel and efficient strategy has been developed to immobilize ZIF crystals on a macroporous phyllosilicate mineral. As an example, water-stable ZIF-8 nanocrystals were synthesized and assembled on the dopamine-modified surface of expanded vermiculite using the sequential addition of methanol solutions of Zn(NO3)(2)center dot 6H(2)O and 2-methylimidazole. The ZIF-8 nanoparticle-decorated mineral exhibited a dense growth of microporous ZIF-8 nanocrystals of 80 +/- 10 nm, resulting in 9.8 wt% of ZIF-8 loading and a BET surface area of 120 m(2)/g.

AB Calcium phosphate cement (CPC)/small intestinal submucosa (SIS) composite scaffold was prepared in this work by subtly stacking bio-inspired Haversian motifs (lamellar cylindrical motifs), which can form a structure similar to the Haversian microstructure in natural bones. SIS is rich in collagen and CPC can be easily transformed to hydroxyapatite into body fluids, making the components of the scaffold similar to natural bones. Porosity and specific surface area of the scaffold were 32 +/- 0.58%, and 26.749 +/- 2.691 m(3)/m(3) respectively. Pore size mainly ranges from 100 mu m to 400 mu m. The large specific surface area and the pore size are not only beneficial to cells attachment, growth, migration and revascularization, but also to the scaffold mineralization. After soaking for 6 hat 10 x simulated body fluids, the compressive strength of the scaffold was about 27 MPa, 3 times more than that of the original scaffold. Thanks to the increasing compressive strength with holding the soaking time, the scaffold should be suitable for in vivo implanting and bone remodeling. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Constructing heterojunction is one of the methods to restrain the hole-electron recombination and thus improve the photoelectric property. In this work, PbS nanoparticles were grown directly on ultra thin MoS2 nanosheets to fabricate 2D MoS2/PbS nanocomposites via a facile one-pot solvothermal route. PbS nanoparticles anchored on MoS2 sheets exhibited high crystallinity and uniformity. The particle size can be controlled by varying the precursor concentration. The nanocomposites displayed higher photocurrent compared with pristine MoS2, due to the improved light harvesting and the construction of p-n heterojunction structure.

AB The success of bone substitute can be undermined by poor osseointegration and infection. To counter both issues, many researches attempted to incorporate antibacterial agents such as silver into biocompatible materials like hydroxyapatite. However, the balance between both properties is often fraught with compromise. Silver, silicon co-substituted hydroxyapatite (Ag,Si-HA) was developed to create bioactivity in tandem with antibacterial properties. The favourable in vitro results prompted us to study further Ag, Si-HA in vivo. Haematoxylin and eosin, Masson's trichrome and immunohistochemistry staining of type I collagen results demonstrated that the co-substitution of Si in Ag-HA to form Ag,Si-HA, could enhance its osteoconductivity and biocompatibility in the rabbit femoral condyle model.

The Sn nanorods with a diameter of similar to 50 nm are protected by similar to 3 nm CNTs. The whole hierarchical structure forms a conductive network, which ensures rapid transportation of electrons. As a result, when utilized as lithium-ion battery anode, the 3DC-Sn@CNT electrode exhibits good cycling stability (700 mAh g (1) after 100 cycles at 0.1 A g (1)) and rate performance (240 mAh g 1 at 1 A g (1)).

AB Modified oxide layer was successfully prepared on AZ91 magnesium alloy by plasma electrolytic oxidation (PEO) using phosphate electrolyte containing calcium fluoride (CaF2). Evaluating the corrosion behavior of the oxidized AZ91 magnesium alloy by potentiodynamic polarization in simulated body fluid (SBF) solution indicated that addition of CaF2 to electrolyte leads to considerable decrease in corrosion rate caused by surface porosity, oxide layer thickness, and formation of MgF2 phase. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) revealed that the resistance of the outer porous and the inner barrier parts of the oxide layer increased by 3 and 41 times, respectively. Presence of biological calcium ion along with fluorine and phosphorous ions in the oxide layer composition created a higher driving force for nucleation and growth of bioactive layer by decreasing the contact angle with SBF solution.

AB R5 is a synthetic silaffin peptide derived from diatoms that can precipitate monodisperse silica particles (SPs) from silicic acid under mild biomimetic conditions. Due to the range of potential applications, it is important to understand the mechanisms that govern such silica precipitation, however to date these mechanisms remain ambiguous. Here, we report that the N-terminal residues of R5 substantially impact the silica precipitating mechanism, most likely by affecting the self-assembling properties of the peptide. Our results show that the morphology of silaffin-derived SPs can be modulated by changing the N-terminus of the peptide. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A bilayered polylactic-co-glycolic acid (PLGA)/multiwall carbon nanotubes (MWNTs)/bacterial cellulose (BC) composite membrane was prepared by vacuum freeze-drying and electrospinning for use as a guided tissue regeneration (GTR) membrane to repair maxillary canine periodontal defects in beagle dogs. Morphological and histological observations and analyses were performed to characterize the membrane. The bilayered membrane comprised a lower fibrous BC film layer and an upper electrospun PLGA/MWNTs film layer with a three-dimensional network structure. The histological results showed that the bilayered membrane promoted periodontal tissue regeneration. The BC/PLGA/MWNTs membrane may be an ideal GTR membrane candidate and thus has potential therapeutic applications in periodontal disease. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Lithium aluminosilicate glass-ceramics were prepared using melt-quenching method. B2O3 was added into glass-ceramics as sintering aids. The effects of B2O3 addition and sintering temperature on the microstructure, phase composition, dielectric properties, thermal and mechanical properties and densification of glass-ceramics were investigated. The addition of B2O3 lowered the sintering temperature of the glass-ceramics from 950 to 800 degrees C, and improved the bending strength from 97 to 195 MPa. The coefficient of thermal expansion of materials increased with the increasing sintering temperature and B2O3 content. The results show that B2O3 is helpful to densification sintering of glass-ceramics. The samples with 3 wt% B2O3 sintered at 800 degrees C showed epsilon(r) of 7.2, tan delta of 1.4 x 10(-3), bending strength of 195 MPa, and CTE of 2.67 x 10(-6) K-1. The results indicated that the LAS glass-ceramic can be a possible candidate for LTCC substrate applications. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In the present work, dense silicon nitride (Si3N4) was developed using pressureless sintering for biomedical applications. The Si3N4 samples with 15 wt% sintering additives (Al2O3 + Y2O3) were sintered at 1700 degrees C for 2 h followed by characterization in terms of phase constituents, mechanical, in vitro tribological and biological properties. In vitro tribological tests in simulated body fluid (SBF) revealed that the wear rate and coefficient of friction of Si3N4 reduced by one order of magnitude in the presence of 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). The in vitro biocompatibility evaluations using human osteoblast-like cells (MG63) confirmed that the sintered Si3N4 samples were non-cytotoxic. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Flat TiO2 thin films were dip coated on contact lens polymer substrates (fluorinated ethylene propylene copolymer, FEP) using a hybrid sol-gel and annealed for 12 hat <= 200 degrees C. The grain sizes were in the range 10-20 nm but extensive shrinkage cracking was present. The crystallinities of the films annealed at <= 150 degrees C increased with increasing temperature gradually but only to a limited extent, although the crystallinity at 200 degrees C was significant. Recrystallisation resulted in decreased transparency, increased reflectivity, and a red shift to lower band gap. The methylene blue (MB) degradation was in the order 25 degrees C < 200 degrees C < 100 degrees C < 150 degrees C, indicating that the photocatalytic performance was dominated by crystallinity and exposed surface area, the latter of which decreased at 200 degrees C owing to partial submergence in the softened polymeric substrate. The films indicated antimicrobial capacity since they exhibited a maximal level of S. aureus destruction (85%) following 5 h of UV irradiation. The films also appeared to be microstructurally stable following wash testing in contact lens washing solution. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB To meet the practical application, it is still a challenge to prepare TiO2 with excellent photocatalytic performance. Therefore, in this work, TiO2 photocatalyst with enhanced sunlight-driven photocatalytic activity was facilely obtained after hydrothermal treatment of TiO2 with the assistance of sodium dodecyl benzene sulfonate (SDBS). TiO2 and SDBS-TiO2 were characterized by Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) method, X-ray diffraction (XRD), UV-Vis diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), surface photovoltage (SPV) spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), respectively. The photocatalytic performance of the photocatalysts toward Rhodamine B (RhB) discolorization was evaluated. The results display that a much higher photo-induced charge separation rate, active free radicals and surface hydroxyl radical content were produced in the SDBS-TiO2 photocatalytic system. The results further reveal that the photocatalytic performance of SDBS-TiO2 is more than two times of that of the reference TiO2. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A high performance, low operating voltage organic field effect transistor (OFET) has been fabricated by utilizing organically modified silicate (ormosil) based film as dielectric. The ormosil film is fabricated by a sol-gel method at low temperature (180 degrees C) and exhibits a high dielectric (k = 33), a smooth surface (R-q = 0.29 nm) and a low leakage current density (5 x 10(-9) A cm(-2) at -2 V). The ormosil film contains hydrophobic methyl (CH3) functional groups derived from methyltriethoxysilane (MTES) and these groups produce a surface with hydrophobic character and low surface energy for pentacene film growth. The OFET with the ormosil dielectric exhibits excellent performs with high mobility (0.80 cm(2) V-1 s(-1)), low operating voltage (-1.5 V), low threshold voltage (-0.25 V) and low sub-threshold swing (192 mV dec(-1)). The result demonstrates that the ormosil film can be used as a high performance dielectric for OFETs, and provides a promising way for low power and low cost organic electronics.

AB Ball milling (BM) a Cu nanopowder resulted in an increase of the average grain size from 8 to 52 nm, followed by a gradual decrease to 19 nm. In contrast, the grain size of coarse-grained Cu decreased monotonically from 290 nm to 19 nm. Fitting a model to the kinetic curves indicates that the two processes have similar activated volumes during collisions. It also reveals that particles over 100 nm are formed when nanoparticles are compressed during a collision for the first time. (C) 2017 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

AB This study investigated the tensile and fracture behaviour of additively manufactured MS1-H13 hybrid hard steel. Samples were prepared using Direct Metal Laser Sintering (DMLS) technique to additively deposit MS1 powder on as received H13 tool steel round bars. Four different heat-treatments were subsequently applied to the samples and uniaxial tensile tests to fracture were completed. Results found peak hardness/strength could be achieved with a single heat-treatment cycle and fracture in peak hardened samples occurred in MS1 adjacent to the print interface, as verified by Energy Dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis. As-printed samples fractured in the H13 material away from the interface. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The mechanochemical reaction of zinc peroxide (ZnO2) with zinc (Zn) and copper (Cu) metal powders was examined. Ex-situ characterization of samples was adopted to monitor the progress of reaction and to determine the nature of final product. Cubic ZnO2 transformed to hexagonal ZnO after grinding for 4 h. Band gap of the sample, determined by Kubelka-Munk function, was 3.02 eV. Vibration modes at 509 and 557 cm(-1) due to defects were prominent for this sample in its Raman spectrum. This was endorsed by intense emission at 440 nm in the photoluminescence spectrum as well. The reaction of ZnO2 with Cu powder was slow and completed after grinding for 11 h yielding hexagonal ZnO. Doping of Cu2+ for Zn2+ in ZnO was confirmed from reduction in the band gap as compared with bulk ZnO. High concentration of defects manifested as emissions at 377, 409 and 419 nm when excited with lambda = 320 nm. Both the samples catalyzed photo degradation of Rhodamine-B (Rh-B) dye solution. The recyclable nature of it has also been examined. (C)2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

This unique one-step design for hybridizing hierarchical porous MoO2 spheres with reduced graphene oxide (RGO) sheet is different from that of MoO2/graphene composites reported previously. The resultant hierarchical MoO2@RGO electrode was applied as an anode material for lithium-ion batteries and found to exhibit outstanding electrochemical performance with a reversible capacity of 708 mAh g(-1) at a current density of 0.5 A g(-1) after 50 cycles.

AB Copper (Cu) film bonded with polymer substrates offers better dimensional stability than that of deposited Cu especially in humid environment. However, poor adhesion is an issue in both cases. In this paper, we demonstrate a two-step, low temperature direct bonding technique for liquid crystal polymer (LCP) and copper (Cu) using oxygen plasma. The bonded interface showed high peel strength. This strong adhesion is due to the interdiffusion of Cu and carbon atoms into LCP and Cu film respectively. These phenomena resulted in three-dimensional metal clusters of Cu atoms and islands at the LCP/Cu interface, which gradually diffuse into the LCP. Interfacial elemental analysis reveals an intermediate oxide layer formation due to Cu2O and C=O. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The hierarchical micro/nanostructure has been fabricated on the surface of titanium by various surface modification methods for improving the biocompatibility of implants. However, it is still a challenge to construct a regular micro- and nanostructure on the surface of titanium. In this study, an orderly micro/nanostructure was produced on titanium surface by micro-milling and anodic oxidation. Compared to polished titanium, micro/nanostructured titanium presented increased roughness and enhanced hydrophilicity. More importantly, the proliferation of osteoblasts was significantly improved on the surface of micro/nanostructured titanium. This study provides a promising strategy to fabricate an orderly micro/nanostructure on the surface of titanium for improving cell proliferation. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Analysis of the thermodynamics controlling phase selection are re-evaluated based on newly published results of atomistic simulations that quantify grain tilt-boundary surface energy. Nucleation does not occur until some critical misorientation develops through dislocation association such that the grain boundary becomes a potent nucleation site. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB Acid Red 27-crosslinked PANI (ARCP) was prepared via chemical oxidative polymerization in the presence of Acid Red 27 (AR-27) as crosslinking agent and doping agent. The results showed that in comparison with the microsized bulky structure of uncrosslinked PANI, the nanofiber structure of ARCP was observed and the diameter of ARCP nanofiber decreased from 300 nm to 60 nm with the increase of feeding molar ratio of AR-27 to aniline. ARCP exhibited a large specific capacitance of 463 F.g(-1) at 2 A.g(-1) and a great electrochemical cycling stability with the specific capacitance retention of 85.5% after 1000 cycles when the feeding molar ratio of AR-27 to aniline was 0.04:1, which was better than uncrosslinked PANI with a specific capacitance of 280 F.g(-1) and the specific capacitance retention of 70.8%.

AB Periprosthetic joint infections that may occur when a prosthetic implant is inserted can cause serious problems in the human body. Infection by antibiotic-resistant bacteria is known to be difficult to treat because it can form a thick biofilm. This paper proposes a dual antibiotic delivery system capable of sustained release from a biodegradable material to treat periprosthetic joint infections caused by antibiotic resistant bacteria. Three-dimensional printing technology was used to fabricate scaffolds incorporating dual antibiotics. A cylindrical biodegradable polymer scaffold capable of releasing antibiotics was prepared by homogeneously mixing tobramycin or vancomycin, or a mixture thereof, and combining with a ring-shaped metal scaffold. The release profile of the antibiotics released from the fabricated hybrid scaffold was measured by high performance liquid chromatography and the susceptibility of antibiotics confirmed using Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli. In addition, non-cytotoxicity of the antibiotic-incorporated scaffolds was confirmed. In conclusion, we successfully fabricated a metal polymer hybrid scaffold capable of sustained release of two antibiotics therefore, it is expected that metal-polymer hybrid scaffold provides promising treatment for periprosthetic joint infection.

AB Porous Al2O3 ceramics with different SiC contents were successfully prepared through preceramic polymer process following by sintering at 1500 degrees C at N-2 atmosphere, where ball-shape Al2O3 powders and preceramic polymer silicone resin were used as the matrix and the binder. According to the SEM, XRD and elemental analysis, it was found that C-nanowires were formed in the gap between grains in sintered samples, which was formed by the organic-inorganic transformation of silicone resin at N-2 atmosphere. The existence of SiC was beneficial for the formation of C-nanowires. With the increase of SiC content in the samples, the porosity had no evidently change, however, the bending strength increased from 23 MPa to 50 MPa. (C) 2017 Elsevier By. All rights reserved.

AB The construction of high-quality graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4)-based heterojunctions remains a grand challenge. Herein, the ternary heterojunctions of g-C3N4/ZnS/CuS has been fabricated via a facile three step process: the polymerization of melamine, the loading of ZnS nanoparticles (NPs), and further deposition of hexagonal CuS nanosheets. Compared with pure g-C3N4, there is an extended visible-light absorption over 500-800 nm for g-C3N4/ZnS/CuS, which enables the possible utilization of low-energy visible light. Moreover, ZnS NPs interface layers and hexagonal CuS nano-sheets can be both utilized as electron co-catalysts to markedly improve the separation efficiency of the photo-generated electrons and holes and decrease interface transfer resistance, resulting in highly efficient photocatalytic activity for degradation of Rhodamine B (RhB) and significantly enhanced photoconductivity in an all-solid-state device. This work can be helpful for developing other effective hetero-structured photocatalysts and photoelectrical devices. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB We report the successful synthesis and characterization of Zn1-xCuxO (x = 0.05, 0.10, 0.15, 0.20) thin films prepared by a simple and facile Successive Ionic Layer Adsorption and Reaction (SILAR) method. The nitrogen monoxide (NO) gas sensing properties of the Zn1-xCuxO sensors were studied systematically. The sensors were proved to have acceptable responses towards 20 ppb NO gas. Zn0.90Cu0.10O exhibited improved sensing performance at operating temperature of 55 degrees C compared to other samples. To improve sensor selectivity, a molecular zeolite filter was coated on the Zn0.90Cu0.10O sensor. The gas sensing results showed that the selectivity of intergrown zeolite filter coated Zn0.90Cu0.10O sensor enhanced significantly compared to uncoated sensors. (C) (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

ID PERFORMANCE
AB The tradeoff between performance and fabrication costs plays a vital role in thermoelectric application. In this paper, an efficient fabrication method for thermoelectric composite materials with low cost is presented. The mixtures of P-type Bi-0.5Sb1.5Te3 (BST) powders and epoxy resin with different ratios were prepared and cold-pressed using a stainless steel die under 70 Mpa for 3 min. The composite samples were then thermo-cured at 75 degrees C for 3 h and tested. The composite samples demonstrated a much lower thermal conductivity of 0.55 W m(-1) K-1 in comparison with 1.48 W m(-1) K-1 at 125 degrees C of the bulk BST material. The ZT of the composite samples was measured and compared with that of the conventional Bi2Te3-based ingot. This fabrication method significantly simplifies the process of thermoelectric materials compared with traditional preparation technique. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID OSTEOGENIC DIFFERENTIATION
AB Magnetic stimulation and magnetically responsive scaffolds can play unique roles in promoting bone repair and regeneration. Here, we designed and fabricated a novel type of magnetic porous scaffold that integrates superparamagnetic, cytocompatibility, and osteostimulation properties by incorporating a spherical core-shell nano-iron oxide-hydroxyapatite (Fe3O4-HA) composite into polyurethane (PU). Its structural, physicochemical and magnetic properties, as well as its preliminary cytocompatibility were evaluated. The results show that the scaffold had a highly interconnected porous structure with a porosity of about 65%, a pore size distribution of 100-600 mu m and a compressive strength of 4.16 MPa. The results of the magnetic hysteresis loops suggest that the composite scaffolds possess superparamagnetism and that the saturation magnetization of the scaffold was about 2.19 emu/g. The cell culture indicates that the porous magnetic scaffold had good cell affinity and cytocompatibility. In general, this study demonstrates that the Fe3O4-HA/PU composite scaffold integrating both magnetic properties and bio-compatibility may be an ideal candidate material for bone repair.

ID HYDROGEN-PRODUCTION
AB mac-FTO (ordered macroporous fluorine doped tin oxide) films were fabricated on FTO glass as structured substrates for supporting CdxZn1-xS photocatalysts. A series of CdxZn1-xS (x = 1-0.2) photocatalysts were decorated on the mac-FTO film via simple in-situ deposition. Through the manipulation of Cd:Zn atomic ratios, photoelectrochemical results show that the optimized CdxZn1 S-x@mac-FTO electrode generates photocurrent density up to 9 mA cm(-2) under visible light at 0 V vis. V-Ag/AgCl. The larger surface area in comparison to planar FTO electrode and the improved conductivity in comparison to macroporous semiconductor electrodes are realized as an increase in photocurrent support.

ID MICROSTRUCTURE DEVELOPMENT
AB Strength enhancement of Mg-based alloys without deteriorating their ductility is currently a major scientific and industrial challenge. In this study, discs of as-cast EZ33A alloy were processed by high-pressure torsion (HPT). The coarse-grained cast material was turned to ultrafine-grained (UFG) of similar to 240 nm, similar to 135 nm and similar to 127 nm size, after 1, 3 and 10 turns, respectively. Simultaneously, hardness increased from 60 HV for the as-cast material to 90-95 HV after HPT processing. Samples subjected to various HPT routes showed enhanced ultimate tensile strength of 270 MPa, along with their uniform elongation up to 10%. The simultaneous increase of strength and ductility was attributed to the bimodal grain size distribution, as well as to the fragmentation and redistribution of brittle (Mg,Zn)(12)Ce phase.

AB Aromatic poly(ether-ether-ketone)s (PEEKs) have received much attention to be used in biomedical field, due to their good physicochemical properties, processability and biocompatibility. Metal-exchanged zeolites have demonstrated to be good biomaterials in various applications, because of their low-toxicity, functional groups for grafting and high dispersibility. In this study, new materials based on silver containing zeolite L (Ag-ZL) and a PEEK containing phthalide units and pendant carboxylic groups were prepared. The films were characterized by FTIR spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy and humidity absorption measurements. Their antimicrobial activity and cytotoxicity were investigated. The films having 12% Ag-ZL showed antimicrobial activity against Gram positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus 25923 ATCC and Staphylococcus aureus MRSA 43300 ATCC) and Gram negative bacteria (Escherichia coli 25922 ATCC) while those having 2% Ag-ZL were active only towards Gram positive bacteria. All the samples exhibited reduced cytotoxicity being thus potential candidates for biomedical applications. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB We presented a series of Ba-3(ZnB5O10)PO4: Eu2+ borophosphate phosphors and highlighted their photo-luminescence characteristics of intrinsic Eu2+ emission. Under near-ultraviolet excitation, the composition-optimized Ba-2.95(ZnB5O10)PO4: 0.05Eu(2+) generated bright blue emission peaking at 415 nm with an internal quantum efficiency of 30.1%, corresponding to the electric-dipole allowed 4f-5d transition of the Eu2+ ions. The nonradiative transition between Eu2+ ions in Ba-3(ZnB5O10)PO4: Eu2+ phosphors was attributable to be the dipole-dipole interaction, and the activation energy for thermal quenching was calculated to be 0.223 eV. Crystallographic site-occupations of Eu2+ ions in the Ba-3(ZnB5O10)PO4 host were also assigned and only one Eu2+ luminescence center that substituted nine-coordinated Ba site was confirmed. The Ba-2.95(ZnB5O10)PO4: 0.05Eu(2+) phosphor exhibited a better light yield with chromaticity coordinates of (0.168, 0.049) and correlated color temperature of 2009 K than that of commercial phosphor BaMgAl10O17: Eu2+. These results indicate the Ba-3(ZnB5O10)PO4: Eu2+ phosphors are competitive as the promising blue-emitting phosphor-converted materials for white light-emitting diodes. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

In a forward flow, volatility in transportation cost, holding cost, and forecasting the market's demand are the most challenging issues for decision makers, while determining the rate of returned products and efficiency in recycling the returned products are crucial parameters to predict in reverse flow. In this paper, it is aimed to develop and apply a fully fuzzy programming (FFP) method to determine the possible upper, middle, and lower ranges of profit for a multi-echelon battery CLSC with multi-components, multi-product in multi-period under imprecise information. In addition, we extend the proposed model to multi-objective to consider the green factors related to plants and battery recovery centers. Fuzzy analytic network process (Fuzzy ANP) is utilized to alter the qualitative measurements to the measurable parameters. Then, distance technique and epsilon-constraint method are utilized for solving the multi-objective problem. We illustrate the application of the model in Vancouver, Canada using maps.

AB With the emerging trend of green supply chain management, supplier selection and order allocation based on green criteria have become very important in this competitive world. During the selection process of the eligible suppliers, qualitative as well as quantitative factors should be considered. In this paper, a novel mathematical model is developed to select a set of suppliers, and assign the order quantity. Due to the importance of environmental concerns, both qualitative and quantitative environmental criteria are taken into account in this research. The proposed model comprises two phases namely a two-stage QFD, and a stochastic multi-objective mathematical model. The stochastic (scenario) approach helps to manage the uncertainty in the order allocation process. Furthermore, trapezoidal fuzzy numbers are utilized to handle the vagueness in human thoughts. The application of the proposed model is shown in beverages industry. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The cellular cytoskeleton is a dynamic subcellular structure that can be a marker of key biological phenomena including cell division, organelle movement, shape changes and locomotion during the avascular tumor phase. Little attention is paid to quantify changes in the cytoskeleton while nuclei and cytoplasmic both are present in subcellular microscopic images. In this paper, we proposed a quantitative image analysis method to analyze subcellular cytoskeletal changes using a texture analysis method preceded by segmentation of nuclei, cytoplasm and ruffling regions (area except nuclei and cytoplasm). To test and validate this model we hypothesized that Mammary Serine Protease Inhibitor (maspin) acts as cytoskeleton regulator that mediates cell-extracellular matrix (ECM) adhesion in tumor. Maspin-a tumor suppressor gene shows multiple tumor suppressive properties such as increasing tumor cell apoptosis and reducing migration, proliferation, invasion, and overall tumor metastasis. The proposed method obtained separated ruffling regions from segmentation steps and then adopted gray level histograms (GLH) and grey-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) texture analysis techniques. In order to verify the reliability, the proposed texture analysis method was used to compare the control and maspin expressing cells grown on different ECM components: plastic, collagen 1, fibronectin and laminin. The results show that the texture parameters extracted reflect the different cytoskeletal changes. These changes indicate that maspin acts as a regulator of the cell-ECM enhancement process, while it reduces the cell migration. Overall, this paper not only presents a quantitative image analysis approach to analyze subcellular cytoskeletal architectures but also provides a comprehensive tool for the biologist, pathologist, cancer specialist, and computer scientist to understand cellular and subcellular organization of cells. In long term, this method can be extended to be used in live cell tracking in vivo, image informatics based point-of-care expert system and quantification of various complex architectures in organisms.

SO EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS

DE Genetic programming; Genetic algorithm; Fitness
AB This research investigates the hypothesis that the use of different fitness measures at the different generations of genetic programming (GP) is more effective than the convention of applying the same fitness measure individually throughout GP. A genetic algorithm (GA) is used to induce the sequence in which fitness measures should be applied over the GP generations. Subsequently, the performance of a GP system applying the evolved fitness measure sequence is compared with the conventional GP approach. The former approach is shown to significantly outperform standard GP on varied benchmark problems. Furthermore, the evolved fitness measure sequences are shown to generalize within a problem class: therefore, the sequences can be evolved off-line for different problem classes. Critically, sequences trained on the problem classes are also shown to generalize to complex, real-world problems. Overall, the findings of the study are in favor of the hypothesis. This study has revealed the effectiveness of dynamic fitness measures when applied to benchmark and real-world problems. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Driving simulators are effective tools for producing the feeling of driving a real car through generation of a similar environment and motion cues. The main problem of motion simulators is their limited workspace which does not allow them to produce the exact motions of a real vehicle, hence they need a Motion Cueing Algorithm (MCA). A high-fidelity motion simulator can be used for vehicle prototyping and testing as well as driver/pilot training to enhance transportation safety. Using motion simulators with the capability of replacing realistic motions for these purposes is less risky for drivers and more time and cost-effective. Due to workspace limitations, washout filters have been designed to bring motion simulators back to a neutral position; however, the problem of violation of platform constraints is still an issue. Recently Model Predictive Control (MPC) has become popular in driving simulators. The primary advantage of this control method is respecting constraints and consideration of future dynamics. The horizon windows of future control and prediction affect the computational burden and the output performance. As these horizons are chosen manually by the designer, they are sub-optimal and in some cases too wide or narrow. In this paper, a novel method based on Genetic Algorithm (GA) is employed to achieve the best control and prediction horizons considering minimization of several terms such as sensation error, displacement and the computational burden. This new method is proposed to eliminate the MPC-MCA drawbacks such as time-consuming empirical guessing by iterative trial-and-error for the initial control and prediction horizons as selecting the initial control and prediction horizons based on trial-and-error can lead to large sensation error, low motion fidelity, inefficient platform usage as well as the computational burden. Therefore, this method provides a new framework for tuning not only the MPC-MCA optimally but also all the MPC-based applications while minimizing the desired cost function and computational load. The simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed method in terms of output performance improvement and the computational burden. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID RECOGNITION
AB This paper reports a face identification system for visible, look alike and post surgery face images of individuals using some novel variants which are exploited from local graph structure (LGS). The proposed LGS variants attempt to improve the performance of the face identification system under the influence of pose changes, facial expression changes, illumination variation, makeup, accessories (glasses) and facial complexity (look alike and plastic surgery). The idea is to represent each pixel along with its neighborhood pixels of a face image based on the regenerated directed local graph structure. From the newly defined local graph structure a binary pattern is generated for each pixel and this binary string is then converted into a decimal value and generates a transformed pattern. Finally, this transformed pattern is used to generate a concatenated histogram which is then used for matching and identification by using three well-known classifiers, namely, locally scaled sum of squared differences (LSSD), locally scaled sum of absolute differences (LSAD), and histogram intersection (HI). Unlike prior works, face images do not have to undergo the preprocessing stages as each novel variant deals with local structure of a face image by disregarding other effects. The UMIST, the JAFFE, the Extended Yale Face B, the Look-alike and the Plastic Surgery face databases are used for the evaluation. Extensive experiments on face databases exhibit promising and convincing results. Further, the experimental results have led to a robust identification system which is found to be invariant to different challenges made of due to capturing environment and face modality changes.

AB The design of wood-fiber based thermal insulating material with optimized properties and characteristics requires a good scientific knowledge of the latter. Currently, the technical, economic and ecological characteristics of a wood-fiber based composite mat are not well known. This article presents a methodology for the acquisition of expert knowledge so that the properties and characteristics can be modeled. The knowledge domain is multidisciplinary and it was delimited and decomposed into disciplines and domains of expertise. A panel of seven experts was constituted to cover the various disciplines and domains of expertise of the knowledge domain. Knowledge acquisition sessions, guided by the estimated importance and the availability of knowledge, were conducted using semi-structured interviews and the mapping of the existing causal relations between variables. A causal map was established to represent the causal knowledge of each of the experts and then, the established causal maps were assembled into a unique global causal map, which was subsequently validated by the experts. It contains the information necessary for formulating the properties and characteristics to be optimized, which were: thermal conductivity; thickness recovery of the material; the manufacturing cost and the product's environmental impact. Properties and characteristics are function of raw material type, their morphological properties and the manufacturing process variables. This methodology makes it possible to establish which objectives to optimize and which variables influence each objective. Consequently, the objective functions of the optimization problem can be clarified, specified and modeled. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID NAMED ENTITY RECOGNITION
AB In multiword expression (MWE) recognition, there exist many studies where different learning methods are employed to decide whether given word combination is a multiword expression. The recognition methods commonly utilize a number of features that are extracted from a data source, frequently from the given text. Though the recognition methods and the features are well studied, we believe that to achieve the best possible performance with a learning method, different subsets of features should also be considered and the best performing subset must be selected.
   In this paper, we propose a procedure that covers the performance comparison of well-known feature selection methods to obtain the best feature subset in MWE recognition. The evaluation tests are performed on a Turkish MWE data set and the performance is measured by precision, recall and Fl values. The highest Fl value =0.731 is obtained by C4.5 classifier employing either wrapper or filtering method in feature selection. In the regarding setting(s), it is examined that the performance is increased by 1.11% compared to the setting where all features are employed in classification.
   Based on the experimental results, it may be stated that feature selection improves the performance of MWE recognition by eliminating the noisy/non-effective features. Moreover, it is obvious that proposed feature selection method contributes to the overall MWE recognition system by reducing the measurement and storage requirements due to the lower number of features in classification, providing a faster and more -cost effective learning model.

AB The models that set the closest targets have made an important contribution to DEA as tool for the best-practice benchmarking of decision making units (DMUs). These models may help defining plans for improvement that require less effort from the DMUs. However, in practice we often find cases of poor performance, for which closest targets are still unattainable. For those DMUs, we propose a two-step benchmarking procedure within the spirit of context-dependent DEA and that of the models that minimize the distance to the DEA efficient frontier. This procedure allows to setting more realistically achievable targets in the short term. In addition, it may offer different alternatives for planning improvements directed towards DEA efficient targets, which can be seen as representing improvements in a long term perspective. Thus, the sequential approach provides managers with a decision-support tool for the design of continuous improvement strategies based on actionable targets, by learning from better practices of others as an expert system. To illustrate, we examine an example which is concerned with the research performance of public Spanish universities. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Recently, Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) are widely used for monitoring and tracking applications. Sensor mobility adds extra flexibility and greatly expands the application space. Due to the limited energy and battery lifetime for each sensor, it can remain active only for a limited amount of time. To avoid the drawbacks of the classical coverage model, especially if a sensor died, K-coverage model requires at least k sensor nodes monitor any target to consider it covered. This paper proposed a new model that uses the Genetic Algorithm (GA) to optimize the coverage requirements in WSNs to provide continuous monitoring of specified targets for longest possible time with limited energy resources. Moreover, we allow sensor nodes to move to appropriate positions to collect environmental information. Our model is based on the continuous and variable speed movement of mobile sensors to keep all targets under their cover all times. To further prove that our proposed model is better than other related work, a set of experiments in different working environments and a comparison with the most related work are conducted. The improvement that our proposed method achieved regarding the network lifetime was in a range of 26%-41.3% using stationary nodes while it was in a range of 29.3%-45.7% using mobile nodes. In addition, the network throughput is improved in a range of 13%-17.6%. Moreover, the running time to form the network structure and switch between nodes' modes is reduced by 12%.

AB Using profit-based evaluation measures is a necessity in business-oriented contexts, as they aid companies in making cost-optimal decisions. Among the measures that effectively include the true nature of costs and benefits in binary classification, the expected maximum profit (EMP) has been used successfully for churn prediction and credit scoring, and defined in general for binary classification problems. However, despite its competitive results against the most frequently used measures, the EMP relies on a fixed probability distribution of costs and benefits, the range of which in real applications is not entirely known. In this paper, we propose to extend this measure by adding random shocks to these distributions. We call this new measure the R-EMP, following the convention of the analogous EMP measure. Our metric adds a stochastic component to each point of the cost-benefit distributions, assuming that costs and benefits have a fixed probability, but its distribution range is subject to an external shock, which can be different for each cost or benefit. The experimental set-up is focused on a credit scoring application using a dataset of a Chilean financial institution, with the attribute selection for a logistic regression being accomplished using the AUC, EMP, H-measure, and R-EMP as the selection criteria. The results indicate that the R-EMP measure is the most robust metric for achieving the greatest profit for the company under uncertain external conditions. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Dimension reduction methods are useful pre-processing tools for efficient quantitative analysis with the aim to preserve the main features of the multidimensional data. However, negative values resulting from the transformation may obscure the interpretation of the analysis. This novel study aims to investigate the effects of non-negative dimension reduction methods on the mean-variance portfolio optimization model. Backtesting results for major stock market indices show that reducing dimensionality of asset prices may improve the overall efficiency of the mean-variance portfolio optimization output.

AB Hand gestures are an intuitive way for humans to interact with computers. They are becoming increasingly popular in several applications, such as smart houses, games, vehicle infotainment systems, kitchens and operating theaters. An effective human-computer interaction system should aim at both good recognition accuracy and speed. This paper proposes a new approach for static hand gesture recognition. A benchmark database with 36 gestures is used, containing variations in scale, illumination and rotation. Several common image descriptors, such as Fourier, Zernike moments, pseudo-Zernike moments, Hu moments, complex moments and Gabor features are comprehensively compared in terms of their respective accuracy and speed. Gesture recognition is undertaken by a multilayer perceptron which has a flexible structure and fast recognition. In order to achieve improved accuracy and minimize computational cost, both the feature vector and the neural network are tuned by a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm based on the Nondominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II). The proposed method is compared with state-of-the-art methods. A real-time gesture recognition system based on the proposed descriptor is constructed and evaluated. Experimental results show a good recognition rate, using a descriptor with low computational cost and reduced size. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The Bag-of-Visual-Words model has emerged as an effective approach to represent local video features for human actions classification. However, one of the major challenges in this model is the generation of the visual vocabulary. In the case of human action recognition, losing spatial-temporal relationships is one of the important reasons that provokes the low descriptive power of classic visual words. In this work we propose a three-level approach to construct visual n-grams for human action classification. First, in order to reduce the number of non-descriptive words generated by K-means clustering of the spatio-temporal interest points, we propose to apply a variant of the classical Leader-Follower clustering algorithm to create an optimal vocabulary from a pre-established number of visual words. Second, with the aim of incorporating spatial and temporal constraints to the Bag-of-Visual-Words model, we exploit the spatio-temporal relationships between interest points to build a graph-based representation of the video. Frequent subgraphs are extracted for each action class and a visual vocabulary of n-grams is constructed from the labels (descriptors) of selected subgraphs. Finally, we build a histogram by using the frequency of each n-gram in the graph representing a video of human action. The proposed approach combines the representational power of graphs with the efficiency of the Bag-of-Visual-Words model. Extensive validation on five challenging human actions datasets demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed model compared to state-of-the-art methods. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Due to the plate formats and multiform outdoor illumination conditions during the image acquisition phase, it is challenging to find effective license plate detection (LPD) method. This paper aims to develop a new detection method for identifying vehicle license plates under low quality images using image processing techniques. In this research, a robust method using a large number of AdaBoost cascades with three levels pre-processing local binary patterns classifiers (3L-LBPs) are used to detect license plates (LPs) regions. The method achieves a very high accuracy for detecting LP number from one vehicle image. The proposed method was tested and trained with the images from 630 and 400 vehicles, respectively. The images involve many difficult conditions, such as low/high contrast, dusk, dirt, fogy, and distortion problems. The experimental results demonstrate very satisfactory performance for LP detection in term of speed and accuracy, and were better than the most of the existing methods. The processing time for the whole testing LPD system was about 1.63 seconds to 2 seconds. The overall probability detection, precision, and f-measurement are 98.56%, 95.9% and 97.19%, respectively; with false positive rate 5.6%. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB As a population-based random search optimization technique, particle swarm optimization (PSO) has become an important branch of swarm intelligence (SI). The tuning of parameters in PSO has attracted the attention of many researchers. This study proposes an alternative technology called hybrid non parametric PSO (HNPPSO) algorithm. Other SI operations, including a multi-crossover operation, a vertical crossover, and an exemplar-based learning strategy, are combined with the proposed algorithm to balance the global and local search capabilities. The first- and second-order stability analyses conducted for the present study showed that the particle positions are expected to converge at a fixed point in the search space and that the variance of the particle positions converges to zero. In the experiments, the proposed algorithm was compared with 10 other advanced PSO techniques using 40 widely used benchmark functions. The experimental results indicated that the proposed algorithm yields better solution accuracy and convergence speed than the other PSO techniques. The proposed algorithm significantly outperformed the other PSO approaches in terms of convergence speed. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In the era of social media, exponential growth of information generated by online social media and e-commerce applications demands expert and intelligent recommendation systems. It has become one of the most valuable tools as it reduces problems such as information overload while selecting and suggesting friends, items, products, jobs etc according to users' interests. Recommendation uses Collaborative Filtering as one of the most popular approaches but the major limitations of this approach are sparsity and cold-start issues. Mostly existing recommendation systems focus on a single domain, on the other end cross-domain collaborative filtering is able to alleviate the degree of sparsity and cold-start problems to a better extent. To avoid these problems, cross domain evolution comes in limelight and has become an emerging topic of research nowadays. This paper mainly discusses the notion of cross-domain recommendation, its techniques and proposes a generalized Cross Domain-Multi Dimension Tensor Factorization (CD-MDTF) approach to trade off influence among domains optimally. Cross Domain recommendation system employs knowledge from source domain and commingles it to target domain which covers the aspect of intelligent behavior and brings it to the category of an expert system. Finally, to evaluate the proposed CD-MDTF approach, experiments are performed on two real-world datasets, Movie-Lens and Book-Crossing. Results validate that sparsity and cold start problem, is reduced by 16% and 25% respectively in comparison to single-domain recommendation systems. Further, the proposed CD-MDTF recommendation system accuracy is validated using precision and recall as evaluation performance metrics which shows an improvement of 41% in precision and 21% in recall. The results show that embedding of multiple domains and multiple dimensions for recommendation helps in result improvement, thereby augmenting the recommendation system performance like an expert and intelligent system.

AB Segmentation of brain MR image tissues has been a challenge because of the embedded nonlinear bias field acquired during the image acquisition process. This problem is further compounded due to the presence of noise. In order to deal with such issues, we have proposed a Variable Variance Adaptive Mean Shift (WAMS) algorithm which not only removes noise but also reinforces the clustering attribute by its mode seeking ability. We have formulated the problem for jointly estimating the bias field, tissue class labels and noise free pixels. Since, all the parameters are unknown and interdependent it is hard to obtain optimal estimates. In this regard, we have proposed a recursive framework to obtain the estimates of the parameters, which are partial optimal ones. In the first step of the recursion, the possibilistic fuzzy clustering algorithms has been applied to determine different clusters and bias field. These clusters are noisy and hence in the second step of the recursion, VVAMS algorithm has been applied on each cluster to eliminate noise and reinforce the modes of the clusters. These two steps constitute one combined iteration. Theoretically, the recursive framework is supposed to converge after large number of recursions but in practice it converges after a few iterations. This proposed scheme has successfully been tested with 50 biased noisy slices from Brainweb database and some real brain MR image data from IBSR database. The results have been quantitatively evaluated by percentage of misclassification, Rand Index, t-test, fuzzy partition coefficient (V-pc), fuzzy partition entropy (V-pe) and Tanimoto index. The quantitative evaluations of the tissue class labels demonstrate the superiority of proposed scheme over the existing methods. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Decision-making processes in private banking must comply with standards for risk management and transparency enforced by banking regulations. Therefore, investors must be supported throughout a risk informed decision process. This paper contributes to the literature by presenting a hybrid integrated framework that considers personal features of the investor and additional characteristics imposed by regulations, for which linguistic evaluations are used with regard to risk exposure. The proposed approach for personal investment portfolios considers legal aspects and investor's preferences as an input to the novel fuzzy multiple-attribute decision making approach for sorting problems proposed in this paper, called FTOPSIS-Class. Then, the next step of the proposed framework uses the sorting results for a fuzzy multi-objective optimization model that considers the risk and return associated with the investor's profile over three objectives. The contributions of this paper are illustrated and validated by using a numerical application in line with a new trend for modern portfolio theory which enables a real world investor's characteristics to be considered throughout the decision-making process.

AB The application of classifiers on data represents an important help in a process of decision making. Any classifier, or other method used for knowledge extraction, suffers a deterioration when it is applied on data with noise. Credal C4.5 (CC4.5) is a recent method of classification, that introduces imprecise probabilities in the algorithm of the classic C4.5. It is very suitable in classification noise tasks, but it has a clear dependency of a parameter. It has been proved that this parameter is related with the level of overfitting of the model on the data used for training. In noisy domains, this characteristic is important in the sense that variations of this parameter can reduce the variance of the model. Depending on the degree of noise that a data set has, the application of different values of this parameter can produce different performance of the CC4.5 model. Hence, the use of the correct parameter is fundamental to attain a high level of performance for this model. In this paper, that problem is solved via a rough procedure to estimate the level of class noise in the training data. Combining this new noise estimation process with the CC4.5, it is presented a direct method that has an equivalent performance than the one of the CC4.5 when it is used with the best value of its parameter for each level of class noise.

DE Adversarial Learning; Classifier Resilience; Cyber Security
AB The use of machine learning algorithms for cyber security purposes gives rise to questions of adversarial resilience, namely: Can we quantify the effort required of an adversary to manipulate a system that is based on machine learning techniques? Can the adversarial resilience of such systems be formally modeled and evaluated? Can we quantify this resilience such that different systems can be compared using empiric metrics?
   Past works have demonstrated how an adversary can manipulate a system based on machine learning techniques by changing some of its inputs. However, comparatively little work has emphasized the creation of a formal method for measuring and comparing the adversarial resilience of different machine learning models to these changes.
   In this work we study the adversarial resilience of detection systems based on supervised machine learning models. We provide a formal definition for adversarial resilience while focusing on multisensory fusion systems. We define the model robustness (MRB) score, a metric for evaluating the relative resilience of different models, and suggest two novel feature selection algorithms for constructing adversary aware classifiers. The first algorithm selects only features that cannot realistically be modified by the adversary, while the second algorithm allows control over the resilience versus accuracy tradeoff. Finally, we evaluate our approach with a real-life use case of dynamic malware classification using an extensive, up-to-date corpus of benign and malware executables. We demonstrate the potential of using adversary aware feature selection for building more resilient classifiers and provide empirical evidence supporting the inherent resilience of ensemble algorithms compared to single model algorithms.

AB The multi-objective evolutionary algorithm based on decomposition (MOEA/D) has been recognized as a promising method for solving multi-objective optimization problems (MOPs), receiving a lot of attention from researchers in recent years. However, its performance in handling MOPs with complicated Pareto fronts (PFs) is still limited, especially for real-world applications whose PFs are often complex featuring, e.g., a long tail or a sharp peak. To deal with this problem, an improved MOEA/D (named iMOEA/D) that mainly focuses on bi-objective optimization problems (BOPS) is therefore proposed in this paper. To demonstrate the capabilities of iMOEA/D, it is applied to design optimization problems of truss structures. In iMOEA/D, the set of the weight vectors defined in MOEA/D is numbered and divided into two subsets: one set with odd-weight vectors and the other with even-weight vectors. Then, a two-phase search strategy based on the MOEND framework is proposed to optimize their corresponding populations. Furthermore, in order to enhance the total performance of iMOEA/D, some recent developments for MOEA/D, including an adaptive replacement strategy and a stopping criterion, are also incorporated. The reliability, efficiency and applicability of iMOEA/D are investigated through seven existing benchmark test functions with complex PFs and three optimal design problems of truss structures. The obtained results reveal that iMOEA/D generally outperforms MOEA/D and NSGA-II in both benchmark test functions and real-world applications. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The proposed learning machine, particle swarm optimization (PSO) based regularized extreme learning adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (PSO-RELANFIS), has the advantages of reduced randomness, reduced computational complexity and better generalization. The fuzzy membership function parameters of the proposed system are randomly selected with in constraint ranges. A regularized loss function is developed using constrained optimization and the optimized regularization parameter is obtained using PSO technique.

AB Constraint solvers have proved to be a powerful tool for both expressing and solving complex problems in many contexts, in particular in Automated Planning and Scheduling. In this work, we propose new constraints to enhancing an implementation of a constraint solver for sets of integers (ic_sets) embedded in the ECLIPSe system. This way, we confer a new vision of modelling that in particular allows a task to be planned on alternate days. In addition, these new constraints make finite domain and finite sets domains to cooperate, reducing the search space and improving the efficiency of the existing set solvers for some specific cases. We report on a prototype implementation and apply these constraints to modelling scheduling problems as benchmarks for a performance analysis. Experiments reveal a relevant improvement with respect to the standard ic_sets solver which only features cardinality as cooperation mechanism between domains. Both enhanced expressiveness and performance are key points for practical applications of such solvers. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The original Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) models have required an assumption that the status of all inputs and outputs be known exactly, whilst we may face a case with some flexible performance measures whose status is unknown. Some classifier approaches have been proposed in order to deal with flexible measures. This contribution develops a new classifier non-radial directional distance method with the aim of taking into account input contraction and output expansion, simultaneously, in the presence of flexible measures. To make the most appropriate decision for flexible measures, we suggest two pessimistic and optimistic approaches from both individual and summative points of view. Finally, a numerical real example in the banking system in the countries of the Visegrad Four (i.e. Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, and Slovakia) is presented to elaborate applicability of the proposed method.

AB We are witnessing an increasing usage of location data by a variety of applications. Consequently, information systems are required to deal with large datasets containing raw data to build high level abstractions. Semantic Web technologies offer powerful representation tools for pervasive applications. The convergence of location-based services and Semantic Web standards allows an easier interlinking and annotation of trajectories. However, due to the wide range of requirements on modeling mobile object trajectories, it is important to define a high-level data model for representing trajectory episodes and contextual elements with multiple levels of granularity and different options to represent spatial and temporal extents, as well as to express quantitative and qualitative semantic descriptions. In this article, we focus on modeling mobile object trajectories in the context of Semantic Web. First, we introduce a new version of the Semantic Trajectory Episodes (STEP) ontology to represent generic spatiotemporal episodes. Then, we present FrameSTEP as a new framework for annotating semantic trajectories based on episodes. As a result, we combine our ontology, which can represent spatiotemporal phenomena at different levels of granularity, with annotation algorithms, which allow to create instances of our model. The proposed spatial annotation algorithm explores the Linked Open Data cloud and OpenStreetMap tags to find relevant types of spatial features in order to describe the environment where the trajectory took place. Our framework can guide the development of future expert systems in trajectory analysis. It enables reasoning about knowledge gathered from large trajectory data and linked datasets in order to create several intelligent services. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Learning from data streams (incremental learning) is increasingly attracting research focus due to many real-world streaming problems and due to many open challenges, among which is the detection of concept drift a phenomenon when the data distribution changes and makes the current prediction model inaccurate or obsolete. Current state-of-the art detection methods can be roughly split into performance monitoring algorithms and distribution comparing algorithms. In this work we propose a novel concept drift detector that can be combined with an arbitrary classification algorithm. The proposed concept drift detector is based on computing multiple model explanations over time and observing the magnitudes of their changes. The model explanation is computed using a methodology that yields attribute-value contributions for prediction outcomes and thus provides insight into the model's decision-making process and enables its transparency. The evaluation has revealed that the methods surpass the baseline methods in terms of concept drift detection, accuracy, robustness and sensitivity. To even further augment interpretability, we visualized the detection of concept drift, enabling macro and micro views of the data. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The use of Tetragenococcus halophilus and Zygosaccharomyces rouxii as starter cultures is essential for desirable volatiles production during moromi stage of soy sauce fermentation. In this study, the effect of simultaneous and sequential inoculation of cultures in moromi fermentation models, with respect to viability, physicochemical changes, and volatiles formation (using SPME-GC/MS) was investigated. Interestingly, an antagonism was observed as T. halophilus only proliferated (3 log increase) in the presence of Z. rouxii, while Z. rouxii growth was suppressed by 4 log in concurrence with pH increase to 7.31. Final content of reducing sugars, ethanol, acetic acid, and amino nitrogen did not differ significantly (p < 0.05) between co-inoculation and sequential inoculation. However, Z. rouxii promoted alcohols formation and produced a more complex aroma profile under suppression. According to Principal Component Analysis (PCA), the inoculation sequence (co-inoculation and sequential) has impacts on volatile compound profiles during moromi fermentation.

AB Lipase from liver of seabass (Lates calcarifer), with a molecular weight of 60 kDa, was purified to homogeneity using ammonium sulfate precipitation and a series of chromatographies, including diethylaminoethyl sepharose (DEAE) and Sephadex G-75 size exclusion columns. The optimal pH and temperature were 8.0 and 50 degrees C, respectively. Purified lipase had Michaelis-Menten constant (K-m) and catalytic constant (k(cat)) of 0.30 mM and 2.16 s(-1), respectively, when p-nitrophenyl palmitate (p-NPP) was used as the substrate. When seabass skin was treated with crude lipase from seabass liver at various levels (0.15 and 0.30 units/g dry skin) for 1-3 h at 30 degrees C, the skin treated with lipase at 0.30 units/g dry skin for 3 h had the highest lipid removal (84.57%) with lower lipid distribution in skin. Efficacy in defatting was higher than when isopropanol was used. Thus, lipase from liver of seabass could be used to remove fat in fish skin.

AB The phosphorylation of sarcoplasmic proteins in postmortem muscles was investigated in relationship to color stability in the present study. Although no difference was observed in the global phosphorylation level of sarcoplasmic proteins, difference was determined in the phosphorylation levels of individual protein bands from muscles with different color stability. Correlation analysis and liquid chromatography -tandem mass spectrometry(LC-MS/MS) identification of phosphoproteins showed that most of the color stability-related proteins were glycolytic enzymes. Interestingly, the phosphorylation level of myoglobin was inversely related to meat color stability. As the phosphorylation of myoglobin increased, color stability based on a* value decreased and metMb content increased. In summary, the study revealed that protein phosphorylation might play a role in the regulation of meat color stability probably by regulating glycolysis and the redox stability of myoglobin, which might be affected by the phosphorylation of myoglobin.

AB In the present work a fast, reliable and safe Ion Exchange Chromatography-Pulsed Amperometry Detection (IC-PAD) method for direct determination of free cyanide in drinking water has been reported. To the best of our knowledge for the first time we are reporting the application of Gold working electrode for detection of free cyanide in a chromatography system. The system shows a wide linear range up to 8000 mg/L. The electrode was found to have improved sensitivity and selectivity in the presence of interfering ions. The detection limit of the system was calculated to be 2 mg/L. Long term evaluation of the electrode was found to be stable. Reproducible results were obtained from analysis of drinking water samples with recoveries of 98.3-101.2% and Relative Standard Deviations (RSD) of < 2%. This study proves the potential application of the newly developed method for the analysis of free cyanide in drinking water. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Oleanolic (OA) and maslinic (MA) acids are two natural triterpenoids with a wide range of beneficial effects for human health. However, their low solubility and permeability make their application in the food, or pharmaceutical, industry difficult. The complexation of OA and MA with alpha-beta-,gamma-, HP-alpha-, HP-beta-and HP-gamma-CDs, under different pH and temperature conditions, has been studied. Neither alpha-nor HP-a-CDs formed inclusion complexes, while beta-, HP-beta-and HP-gamma-CDs provided AL type and gamma-CDs BS phase solubility diagrams. Complexation was shown to be more stable in the case of MA but complexation efficiency was greater for OA. Increasing the pH and temperature of the complexation media tended to improve the complexation process with triterpenic acids.

AB Rice bran was used as a starting material to prepare protein concentrate through enzyme-assisted extraction. The hydrolysis of protein concentrate under in vitro gastrointestinal digestion (pepsin-trypsin system) greatly improved the antioxidant properties. Rice bran protein hydrolysate was further fractionated by membrane ultrafiltration (UF, F1: molecular weight (MW) < 3 kDa, F2: MW 3-5 kDa, and F3: MW 510 kDa). Peptides with smaller MW possessed higher antioxidant activities (P < 0.05). UF showed a great efficacy to selectively separate the metal-chelating peptides. Tyrosine and phenylalanine had positive correlations with their DPPH & ABTS radicals scavenging activities and ferric reducing antioxidant power (r > 0.831). A major peptide fragment was detected at m/z 1088 by a MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. There is high potential that antioxidative peptides from rice bran might also be produced in the gastrointestinal tract of the human body. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The effects of the ester group and solvent on the structure and antioxidant activity of pinobanksin were carried out using DFT calculation. First, the properties of the intramolecular hydrogen-bonds in the investigated compounds were studied. Second, the antioxidant capacities of the investigated compounds were analyzed by HAT, SET-PT and SPLET mechanisms from thermodynamic point. The conclusions are: 1) HAT mechanism is most favorable in the gas and CCl4 phases, while SPLET mechanism is more favored in the CH3CN and H2O phases. In the CHCl3 phase, the thermodynamically preferred mechanism is HAT for the 3 - OH and 5 - OH groups. While, HAT and SPLET mechanisms may run simultaneously for the 7 - OH group. 2) Replacing the 3 - OH group by ester group with different alkyl chains does not change much of the antioxidant activity of pinobanksin. 3) Besides, the 7 - OH group contributes mainly to the antioxidant activities of the investigated compounds.

AB Hydrolysis of Gracilaria lemaneiformis agar by beta-agarase was compared with HCl hydrolysis. The results showed that optimum catalysis conditions for the beta-agarase were pH 7.0 at 45 degrees C. Mass spectroscopy, thin-layer chromatography and GPC results showed that the polymerization degrees of the hydrolysis products by the beta-agarase were mainly four, six and eight( more specific than the hydrolysate by HCl). The enzymatic degradation products of agar were distinctly different from those of HCl hydrolysis in the ratios among galactose and 3,6-anhydro-galactose and sulfate group contents. The NMR spectrometry proved that the products of beta-agarase were neoagaroligosaccharides, which was not found in the agarolytic products by HCl. The neoagarotetraose inhibited tyrosinase activity competitively with the K-I value of 16.0 mg/ml. Hydroxyl radical-scavenging ability of neoagaroligosaccharides was much greater than that of agar HCl hydrolysate. This work suggests that neoagaroligosaccharide products produced by our beta-agarase could be more effective in function than products from acid hydrolysis. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB A salt-tolerant aspartyl aminopeptidase (approximately 57 kDa) from Aspergillus oryzae 3.042 was purified and identified. Specific inhibitor experiments indicated that it was an aminopeptidase containing Zn2+. Its optimal and stable pH values and temperatures were 7 and 50 degrees C, respectively. Its relative activity remained beyond 30% in 3 M NaCl solution for 15 d, and its Km and V-max were slightly affected in 3 M NaCl solution, indicating its excellent salt-tolerance. A comprehensive analysis including protein homology modelling, molecular dynamics simulation, secondary structure, acidic residues and hydrophobicity of interior residues demonstrated that aspartyl aminopeptidase had a greater stability than non-salt-tolerant protease in high salinity. Higher contents of ordered secondary structures, more salt bridges between hydrated surface acidic residues and specific basic residues and stronger hydrophobicity of interior residues were the salt-tolerance mechanisms of aspartyl aminopeptidase.

AB This work reports a novel thermophilic beta-glucosidase (TN0602) from Thermotoga naphthophila RKU-10, demonstrating exceptionally high catalytic selectivity (100%) for the exclusive synthesis of prebiotic galactotrisaccharides (GOS3) in a high volumetric production yield of 23.28 g L-1 h(-1) (higher than the highest value ever reported) at pH 6.5 and 75 degrees C, with milk processing waste lactose as both the galactosyl donor and acceptor. A comparative study with commercial beta-galactosidase from Aspergillus oryzae (AO) with respect to reaction kinetics, enzyme-substrate thermodynamic binding (substrate induced fluorescence quenching) and molecular docking simulation studies showed that beta- glucosidase TN0602 has a deep catalytic "pocket" with a narrow entrance that prevents simultaneous access of lactose and GOS(3) to the catalytic site, explaining its distinct catalytic specificity and reaction kinetics. The findings revealed in this work offer an improved understanding of how enzyme protein structure determines catalytic specificity, which serves as new knowledge to engineer beta-glucosidase for the biosynthesis of designer GOS.

AB In this work, an effective and simple approach for vinegar production from olive oil press-mill wastewaters (OMW) is presented. Effects of sterilization and yeast presence on the acetic acid production were investigated. Sugar addition and inoculum of selected yeast starter have been crucial for a satisfactory acidification. In the obtained olive vinegar, the pH and total acidity were 2.92 and 5.6%, respectively. A considerable high level of ash (2%) and total phenols (3600 mg/L as GAE) characterized olive vinegar, in comparison with samples of apple, wine and balsamic commercial vinegars. Moreover, a high presence of hydroxytyrosol (1019 mg/L) was obtained. This abundant presence of antioxidants makes olive vinegar a promising nutraceutical and environmentally-friendly product, based upon a waste material such as OMW.

AB The aims of this study were the optimization and validation of a new ultrasound assisted phytosterol method through analysis of response surface generated from Box-Behnken design. Variables quantity of sample (g), volume of KOH/MeOH (mL) and ultrasound time (s) were investigated in three levels. The evaluation process of the methodology was executed through determination of analytical parameters, such as selectivity, linearity, accuracy, dynamic linear range, "intra-day" accuracy and limits of detection and quantification. Optimized conditions for stigmasterol determination were 0.25 g; 2.5 mL; 300 s; and beta-sitosterol were 0.25 g; 5.4 mL; 300 s. The evaluated conditions and all investigated analytical parameters showed that the method is effective for determination of analytes beta-sitosterol and stigmasterol. This new analytical method has the same efficiency of the traditional method, while significantly reducing the total time of extraction for 300 s regarding saponification step when compared to 3600 s from the traditional method.

AB Flow injection mass spectrometry (FIMS) combined with chemometrics was evaluated for rapidly detecting economically motivated adulteration (EMA) of milk. Twenty-two pure milk and thirty-five counterparts adulterated with soybean, pea, and whey protein isolates at 0.5, 1, 3, 5, and 10% (w/w) levels were analyzed. The principal component analysis (PCA), partial least-squares-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA), and support vector machine (SVM) classification models indicated that the adulterated milks could successfully be classified from the pure milks. FIMS combined with chemometrics might be an effective method to detect possible EMA in milk.

AB Puffing of coffee beans, which induces heat- and pressure-derived physicochemical changes, was applied as an alternative to roasting. Roasted or puffed coffee beans with equivalent lightness values were compared. The moisture content was higher while the crude fat and protein compositions were lower in puffed beans than in roasted beans. The pH was lower and the acid content was higher in puffed beans than in roasted beans. The roasted beans exhibited greater specific volumes, while the puffed beans displayed greater extraction yields. The trigonelline and total phenolic contents were greater in puffed beans than in roasted beans resulting in an enhanced antioxidant capacity. Sensory evaluation of roasted and puffed coffee bean brews revealed that puffing did not affect the flavor or overall acceptance. The current study provides evidence that puffing is an alternative to roasting coffee beans with various benefits.

AB Apricot polyphenols and carotenoids were monitored after industrial and domestic cooking, and after 2 months of storage for industrial processing.
   The main apricot polyphenols were flavan-3-ols, flavan-3-ol monomers and oligomers, with an average degree of polymerization between 4.7 and 10.7 and caffeoylquinic acids. Flavonols and anthocyanins were minor phenolic compounds. Upon processing procyanidins were retained in apricot tissue. Hydroxycinnamic acids, flavan-3-ol monomers, flavonols and anthocyanins leached in the syrup. Flavonol concentrations on per-can basis were significantly increased after processing. Industrial processing effects were higher than domestic cooking probably due to higher temperature and longer duration. After 2 months of storage, among polyphenols only hydroxycinnamic acids, flavan-3-ol monomers and anthocyanins were reduced.
   Whichever the processing method, no significant reductions of total carotenoids were observed after processing. The cis-beta-carotene isomer was significantly increased after processing but with a lower extent in domestic cooking. Significant decreased in total carotenoid compounds occurred during storage.

AB Wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) dough strength and extensibility are mainly determined by the polymerization of glutenin. The number of high-molecular-weight glutenin subunits (HMW-GS) differs in various wheat varieties due to the silencing of some genes. The effects of Ax1 or Dx2 subunit absence on glutenin polymerization, dough mixing properties and gluten micro structure were investigated with two groups of near-isogenic lines. The results showed that Ax1 or Dx2 absence decreased the accumulation rate of glutenin polymers and thus delayed the rapid increase period for glutenin polymerization by at least ten days, which led to lower percentage of polymeric protein in mature grain. Ax1 or Dx2 absence significantly decreased the dough development time and dough stability, but increased the uniformity of micro structure. Lacunarity, derived from quantitative analysis of gluten network, is suggested as a new indicator for wheat quality.

AB The present work aims to systematically demonstrate the authenticity of honeys with non-extractable proteins for the first time, by means of EA-IRMS and LC-IRMS. Fifty-three pure honeys of various botanical and geographical origins were studied and a criterion on the basis of the stable carbon isotope ratio characterization of total honey and the main sugars was established for pure honeys. Parameters such as delta C-13 values of total honey and the main sugars were well utilized to identify honeys with non-extractable proteins. Thirty-five honeys from which protein could not be extracted were all identified as adulterated with C-4 sugars or C-3 sugars. The use of isotopic compositions and some systematic differences permit the honeys with non-extractable proteins to be reliably identified. The findings obtained in this work could supplement the AOAC 998.12 C-4 sugar method, with regard to honeys from which protein cannot be extracted.

AB Rapid detection of bioactive components in food has attracted great attention. Herein, we report a novel method through surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) spectra based barcodes for simultaneous characterization of chemical structures and bioactivities of nine citrus components for the first time. SERS barcodes were successfully used to characterize and discriminate all the components with high sensitivity down to 40-60 ng. Importantly, SERS barcodes exhibited the 'identity' characteristics. Beyond the molecular structure information, bioactivity information can also be read from the barcodes according to the bioactivity assay and structure-activity relationship. Hence, a simple and intuitive SERS barcoding approach used for simultaneous characterization of chemical structures and bioactivities was established. With a large database of barcodes, there is high potential that the SERS barcoding approach could be further developed to be a rapid, simple and effective foodomics-like approach for bioactive compound identification from a complex food matrix.

The hitherto undescribed compounds are all mono-acyl arsenosugar phospholipids, differing from previously reported natural arsenic-containing phospholipids by containing only one fatty acid on the glycerol group. Collectively, this new group of mono-acyl compounds constituted about 30% of total lipid arsenic; other significant groups were the di-acyl arsenosugar phospholipids (50%) and arsenic hydrocarbons (20%). The origin and relevance of the mono-acyl arsenosugar phospholipids in Kombu, a commercial seafood product, is briefly discussed.

AB A biomimetic enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (BELISA) which was based on molecularly imprinted polymers on paper (MIPs-paper) with specific recognition was developed. As a detector, the surface of paper was modified with gamma-MAPS by hydrolytic action and anchored the MIP layer on gamma-MAPS modified-paper by copolymerization to construct the artificial antibody Through a series of experimentation and verification, we successful got the MIPs-paper and established BELISA for the detection of carbaryl. The development of MIPs-paper based on BELISA was applied to detect carbaryl in real samples and validated by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) based on anti-carbaryl biological antibody. The results of these two methods (BELISA and ELISA) were well correlated (R-2 = 0.944). The established method of MIPs-paper BELISA exhibits the advantages of low cost, higher stability and being re-generable, which can be applied as a convenient tool for the fast and efficient detection of carbaryl.

However, the method is time-consuming when analyzing a large number of samples. In this study, a modified Somogyi-Nelson assay with excellent accuracy and sensitivity was developed using a 96-well microplate.

AB Peanuts roasted to equivalent surface colors at different temperature/time combinations can vary substantially in chemical and physical properties related to product quality. This study used a pilot plant scale roaster that simulates the configurations of one of the most common industrial roaster, a multi-zone belt roaster. Jumbo-size runner-type peanuts were systematically roasted at 5 temperatures (149-204 degrees C) to three Hunter L-values of 53, 48.5, and 43, corresponding to light, medium, and dark roasts. Moisture and tocopherol contents were more closely correlated with roast color rather than temperature, with exceptions at 149 degrees C. Moisture decreased with darker roast color, while the total tocopherols were greatest in peanut oils with darker colors. Yield stress of peanut pastes increased as the color darkened, indicating spreadability correspondingly decreased with darker roast colors. The overall flavor of roasted peanuts was found to be optimized at 177 degrees C/15 min with the medium roast color.

AB The objectives of the current study were to explore the correlation between Raman spectroscopy and lipid characteristics and to assess the potential of Raman spectroscopic methods for distinguishing the different sources of animal-originated feed based on lipid characteristics. A total of 105 lipid samples derived from five animal species have been analyzed by gas chromatography (GC) and FT-Raman spectroscopy. High correlations (r(2) > 0.94) were found between the characteristic peak ratio of the Raman spectra (1654/1748 and 1654/1445) and the degree of unsaturation of the animal lipids. The results of FT-Raman data combined with chemometrics showed that the fishmeal, poultry, porcine and ruminant (bovine and ovine) MBMs could be well separated based on their lipid spectral characteristics. This study demonstrated that FT-Raman spectroscopy can mostly exhibit the lipid structure specificity of different species of animal-originated feed and can be used to discriminate different animal-originated feed samples.

AB This study investigated the effects of the ultrahigh pressure homogenization (pressure, protein concentration, oil phase fraction, pH, temperature, and ionic strength) and storage on the properties of nanoemulsions (100-500 nm range), which were stabilized by laboratory-prepared soybean protein isolate (SPI), beta-conglycinin (7S) and glycinin (11S). The nanoemulsions made with SPI, 7S and 11S proteins exhibited considerable stability over various ionic strengths (0-500 mM NaCl), pH (<4 or >7), thermal treatments (30-60 degrees C) and storage (0-45 days). The far-UV spectra of SPI, 7S, 11S dispersions, and SPI-,7S-, 11S protein-stabilized nanoemulsions were analyzed for the protein structural changes following lipid removal. The ultra-high pressure homogenization changed the secondary structure of SPI, 7S, 11S proteins in the nanoemulsions, and enhanced their stability. This study demonstrated that SPI, 7S, and 11S proteins can be used as effective emulsifiers in nanoemulsions prepared by ultra-high pressure homogenization. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB The impact of cooking methods (boiling, microwaving, griddling and frying in olive and soybean oils) on nutritional composition (protein, minerals, fat, carbohydrates, fibre, fatty acid profile and energy), antioxidant capacity and (poly) phenolic compounds of cactus cladodes (Opuntia ficus-indica) was evaluated. Culinary processes, except boiling, increased soluble and insoluble fibre up to 5.0 g/100 g becoming a good fibre source. Cactus cladodes fried in olive oil showed a healthier fatty acid profile and lower omega-6/omega-3 ratio than in soybean oil. Flavonoids accounted for 80% of total (poly)phenolic compounds, being isorhamnetin the most abundant. Heat treatment, particularly griddling and microwaving, increased every flavonoid and phenolic acid up to 3.2-fold higher than in raw samples, and consequently their antioxidant capacity. Even boiling induced losses in total (poly)phenols and antioxidant capacity by leaching into water, the main compounds were maintained. Principal Component Analysis distributed heat treated cactus cladodes according to their distinctive polyphenols and antioxidant capacity.

AB The roles of the.-aminobutyric acid (GABA) shunt and polyamine (PA) degradation pathway on GABA accumulation were investigated in fresh tea leaves under anaerobic and aerobic sequential incubations. The GABA accumulation was mainly completed in the first anaerobic incubation through the interaction of the GABA shunt with the PA degradation pathway. When treated with aminoguanidine, the diamine oxidase and polyamine oxidase activities were almost completely inhibited, and the GABA contents decreased by 40.7%, 46.4%, 41.0% and 37.5% in the tea leaves of the four cultivars 'Fuyun No. 6', 'Fudingdabai', 'Longjing No. 43' and 'Pingyangtezao', respectively. The glutamate decarboxylase activity decreased significantly, and the accumulation of GABA may increase or decrease because of varietal differences, which occurred mainly relying on the PA degradation pathway during the second anaerobic incubation. Thus, approximately 37%-47% of the GABA formed in fresh tea leaves under hypoxia was supplied by the PA pathway.

AB Rice and rice products have been reported to contain high contents of toxic inorganic arsenic (iAs). The inorganic arsenic contents in microwavable ready-to-eat rice products (n = 30) and different types of Korean rice (n = 102) were determined by a gas chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (GC-MS/MS). The method showed low limit of detection (0.015 pg), high intra-and inter-day repeatability (< 7.3%, RSD), and recovery rates (90-117%). The mean iAs content in the ready-to-eat rice products was 59 mu g kg(-1) (dry weight basis). The mean iAs contents in polished white, brown, black, and waxy rice were 65, 109, 91, and 66 mu g kg(-1), respectively. The percentages of ready-to-eat rice products, white, brown, black, and waxy rice containing iAs over the maximum level (100 mu g kg(-1)) set by EU for the infant foods were 17, 4, 70, 36 and 0%, respectively.

AB This study was undertaken to analyze the effect of conjugation of egg-white lysozyme with guar gum. Lysozyme is an antimicrobial polypeptide that can be used for food preservation. Its antibacterial activity is limited to gram positive bacteria. Conjugation with polysaccharides like guar gum may broaden its activity against gram negatives. Conjugate was developed through Maillard reaction. Assays carried out included sugar estimation, SDS-PAGE, GPC, color, FT-IR, DSC, thermal stability, solubility, emulsifying, foaming and antioxidant activity. In addition, antimicrobial activity of the conjugate was determined against two gram positive (Staphyllococcus aureus and Enterococcus) and two gram negative pathogens (E. coli and Salmonella). Results showed higher functional properties of lysozyme-guar gum conjugate. The antioxidant properties increased from 2.02-35.80% (Inhibition of DPPH) and 1.65-4.93 AAE/g (reducing power) upon guar gum conjugation. Conjugate significantly inhibited gram negative bacteria and the antibacterial activity also increased significantly against gram positive pathogens.

AB The influence of frying time on the taste profile of potato chips was characterized. Direct comparison of isolates from potato chip samples fried for 170 s and 210 s indicated longer frying time increased the perceived umami intensity and decreased the sour intensity. The compounds responsible for the greater umami intensity were identified as monosodium L-pyroglutamate (L-MSpG) and monosodium D-pyroglutamate (D-MSpG). The reduction in sour intensity was attributed to the degradation of D-chlorogenic acid. MSpGs were endogenous in raw potatoes and also thermally generated from glutamic acid during frying. Taste recombination studies further confirmed the contribution of both compounds to the umami character of potato chips. Furthermore, time-intensity taste analysis revealed that topical addition of both L-and D-MSpG enhanced the perceived intensity of the umami taste and the overall flavor characteristic of the potato chips.

AB Clean extracts are essential in LC-MS/MS, since the matrix effect can interfere in the analysis. Alternative materials which can be used as sorbents, such as chitosan in the clean-up step, are cheap and green options. In this study, chitosan from shrimp shell waste was evaluated as a sorbent in the QuEChERS method in order to determine multi-residues of veterinary drugs in different types of milk, i.e., fatty matrices. After optimization, the method showed correlation coefficients above 0.99, LOQs ranged between 1 and 50 mu g kg(-1) and recoveries ranged between 62 and 125%, with RSD < 20% for all veterinary drugs in all types of milk under study. The clean-up step which employed chitosan proved to be effective, since it reduced both the matrix effect (from values between -40 and -10% to values from -10 to +10%) and the extract turbidity (up to 95%). When the proposed method was applied to different milk samples, residues of albendazole (49 mu g kg(-1)), sulfamethazine (< LOQ) and mebendazole (< LOQ) were found.

AB The autolysis of sea cucumber body wall is caused by endogenous proteolysis of its structural elements. However, changes in collagen fibrils, collagen fibres and microfibrils, the major structural elements in sea cucumber body wall during autolysis are less clear. Autolysis of sea cucumber (S. japonicus) was induced by cutting the body wall, and the structural and biochemical changes in its dermis were investigated using electron microscopy, differential scanning calorimetry, infrared spectroscopy, electrophoresis, and chemical analysis. During autolysis, both collagen fibres and microfibrils gradually degraded. In contrast, damage to microfibrils was more pronounced. Upon massive autolysis, collagen fibres disaggregated into collagen fibril bundles and individual fibrils due to the fracture of interfibrillar bridges. Meanwhile, excessive unfolding of collagen fibrils occurred. However, there was only slight damage to collagen monomers. Therefore, structural damage in collagen fibres, collagen fibrils and microfibrils rather than monomeric collagen accounts for autolysis of S. japonicus dermis.

AB Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) combines Near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy and digital imaging to give information about the chemical properties of objects and their spatial distribution. Protein content is one of the most important quality factors in wheat. It is known to vary widely depending on the cultivar, agronomic and climatic conditions. However, little information is known about single kernel protein variation within batches. The aim of the present work was to measure the distribution of protein content in whole wheat kernels on a single kernel basis, and to apply HSI to predict this distribution.
   Wheat samples from 2013 and 2014 harvests were sourced from UK millers and wheat breeders, and individual kernels were analysed by HSI and by the Dumas combustion method for total protein content. HSI was applied in the spectral region 980-2500 nm in reflectance mode using the push-broom approach. Single kernel spectra were used to develop partial least squares (PLS) regression models for protein prediction of intact single grains.
   The protein content ranged from 6.2 to 19.8% ("as-is" basis), with significantly higher values for hard wheats. The performance of the calibration model was evaluated using the coefficient of determination (R-2) and the root mean square error (RMSE) from 3250 samples used for calibration and 868 used for external validation. The calibration performance for single kernel protein content was R-2 of 0.82 and 0.79, and RMSE of 0.86 and 0.94% for the calibration and validation dataset, enabling quantification of the protein distribution between kernels and even visualisation within the same kernel. The performance of the single kernel measurement was poorer than that typically obtained for bulk samples, but is acceptable for some specific applications. The use of separate calibrations built by separating hard and soft wheat, or on kernels placed on similar orientation did not greatly improve the prediction ability. We simulated the use of the lower cost InGaAs detector (1000-1700 nm), and reported that the use of proposed HgCdTe detectors over a restricted spectral range gave a lower prediction error (RMSEC = 0.86% vs 1.06%, for HgCdTe and InGaAs, respectively), and increased R-2 value (R-c(2) = 0.82 vs 0.73).

AB Micronutrient deficiencies result in irreversible physical and cognitive consequences. Fortification of flour is widely applied to address micronutrient deficiencies, but vitamin losses can occur during the storage of fortified products. This work aimed at assessing the combined influence of different factors on vitamin A retention and the oxidative status of wheat flours: storage duration (up to 6 months), temperature during storage, relative humidity within storage facilities, type of packaging (oxygen-permeable or not), and premix composition (with or without ferrous sulphate). Vitamin A degradation was high and occurred rapidly: more than 45% was lost within 3 months in the mildest conditions, whereas over 85% was lost within 3 months in the most severe conditions. Vitamin A retention was related to the extent of oxidation reactions that occurred in flours during storage, and the factors that mostly affected vitamin A retention were the storage duration, the type of packaging and the temperature.

AB The effect of high hydrostatic pressure processing (650 MPa/9 min) on molecular mass distribution, and hydrodynamic and structural parameters of amylose (maize, sorghum, Hylon VII) and amylopectin (waxy maize, amaranth) starches was studied. The starches were characterized by high-performance size-exclusion chromatography (HPSEC) equipped with static light scattering and refractive index detectors and by Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. Significant changes were observed in molecular mass distribution of pressurized waxy maize starch. Changes in branches/branch frequency, intrinsic viscosity, and radius of gyration were observed for all treated starches. The combination of SEC and FTIR data showed that alpha-1,6-glycosidic bonds are more frequently split in pressurized amaranth, Hylon VII, and waxy maize starch, while in sorghum and maize starches, the alpha-1,4 bonds are most commonly split. Our results show that the structural changes found for pressurized starches were more strongly determined by the starch origin than by the processing applied. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Titanium dioxide (TiO2) is a widely used additive in foods. However, in the scientific community there is an ongoing debate on health concerns about TiO2. The main goal of this study is to determine TiO2 content by using laser induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS). To this end, different amounts of TiO2 was added to white chickpeas and analyzed by using LIBS. Calibration curve was obtained by following Ti emissions at 390.11 nm for univariate calibration, and partial least square (PLS) calibration curve was obtained by evaluating the whole spectra. The results showed that Ti calibration curve at 390.11 nm provides successful determination of Ti level with 0.985 of R-2 and 33.9 ppm of limit of detection (LOD) value, while PLS has 0.989 of R-2 and 60.9 ppm of LOD. Furthermore, commercial white chickpea samples were used to validate the method, and validation R-2 for simple calibration and PLS were calculated as 0.989 and 0.951, respectively.

AB The Fenton reaction is used to produce hydroxyl radicals for the evaluation of the antioxidant activity of plant extracts. In this paper the parameters affecting the production of hydroxyl radicals and their spin trapping with DMPO were studied. The use of quinolinic acid (Quin) as an Fe(II) ligand was proposed for antioxidant activity determination of Green tea, orange juice and asparagus extracts. Quin, buffers and pH affect the DMPO-OH signal intensity of the EPR spectra. Quin/Fe(II) and low pH enhance the (OH)-O-center dot generation. Phosphate and Tris-HCl buffers decrease the signal intensity measured in Fe(II)-sulfate and Fe(II)Quin systems. The extracts were analyzed with Fenton systems containing Fe(II)-sulfate and Fe(II)-Quin with and without buffer. The highest activity was shown with Fe(II)-Quin without buffer, this system being less influenced by pH and chelating agents present in the extracts. This paper will help researchers to better design spin trapping experiments for food matrices. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This study describes the development of an analytical approach for the determination of Cr(III) in dairy products by microwave assisted extraction, complexation in situ by ethylenediaminetetraacetate (EDTA) and high performance liquid chromatography hyphenated to inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (HPLC-ICP-MS). The extraction step was optimised by using an experimental design. A limit of quantification of 38 mu g kg(-1) dry weight (d.w.) was obtained whereas the bias (%) measured ranged from 10 to 18%. The repeatability and intermediate precision varied between 1.2-5.0% and 7.5-13.5%, respectively. The method was applied to the analysis of several dairy samples beforehand characterized in terms of Cr(VI) and total chromium (Crtotal). Cr(III) concentrations ranged from < 13 to 255 mu g kg(-1) d.w. The results showed a good agreement between Cr(III) and Crtotal concentration levels.

AB Pasta cooking quality is well known to be related to semolina protein content and composition, however impact of the unextractable polymeric protein content (% UPP) remains disputed. In this work different semolina samples, of variable protein contents (10.5-14.2%) and % UPP (20.2-46.3%) are studied. The changes in % UPP induced by the successive pasta processing steps (mixing, extrusion, drying) but also those occurring during resting periods at 35 degrees C, applied in-between them, were investigated. Effect of a resting period was moderate after mixing, but pronounced after extrusion. Resting of extruded pasta at 35 degrees C significantly increased % UPP, which can even grow beyond that of the semolina. No relationship was found between pasta viscoelastic index (VI) and semolina % UPP or protein content. However, cooked pasta VI was found related to the calculated % UPP of rested fresh pasta.

AB Owing to the overall increase in herbal infusions' consumption, there's a progressively higher need of suitable plant material, as well as adequate conservation techniques to maintain its quality. Among, the available technologies, irradiation is gaining interest as a feasible preservation method. In line with this approach, this wok was designed to evaluate the effects of electron-beam and gamma irradiation over the phenolic profiles of two plant species Melissa officinalis L. (LB) and Melittis melissophyllum L. (BB). Individual phenolics were characterized by high-performance liquid chromatography coupled to a diode array detector and a mass spectrometer (HPLC-DAD-ESI/MS). Irradiated samples showed a general increase in individual phenolic contents, especially in lithospermic acid A in LB and 5-O-caffeoylquinic acid in BB. Thus, this study revealed the potential usefulness of both conservation technologies when employed to this type of plants.

AB This study was aimed at determining the effect of starch oxidation on its acetylation, structure of starch granules, and generation of free radicals. Corn and waxy corn starches were oxidised by NaClO applied in doses of 10, 20, and 30 g Cl/kg of starch, and then acetylated using acetic acid anhydride. The carboxyl, carbonyl, acetyl groups were determined in modified starches. Structural properties of starch granules were evaluated based on molecular weight distribution, gelatinisation, crystallinity, specific surface, intrinsic viscosity. EPR measurements were carried out to establish starch susceptibility to UV irradiation induced generation of free radicals. It was found that the number of carbon centered radicals was dependent on the kind of starch and its chemical modification. Study results allowed concluding that the applied modifications contributed to significant changes in starch granules that were determined not only by the amylose content of starch but also by the degree of its oxidation.

AB The aim of this work was to produce diacylglycerols (DAG) and monoacylglycerols (MAG) with a high content of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA). Rhizomucor miehei lipase mediated-hydrolysis of sardine oil was conducted at several water activities. The system was mechanistically modeled to predict the time evolution of the concentration of triacylglycerols, DAG, MAG and free fatty acids (FFA) and the concentration of saturated, mono-and polyunsaturated fatty acids. The release of the first fatty acid from the triacylglycerol was independent on the unsaturation degree. Contrary, the hydrolysis of the second one was highly affected by the degree of unsaturation, PUFA being the fatty acids that showed the highest resistance to hydrolysis. MAG percentage was maximum (7 mol%) at lower water activities, while DAG content was favored at higher water activities (35 mol%), achieving a 2-fold concentration of DHA. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Fruit and vegetables (F & V) polyphenols have numerous positive health effects, ascribed either to their antioxidant activity within the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) or to bioactivity of their absorbed metabolites. The effect of the F & V matrix on the gastrointestinal bioaccessibility of polyphenols was investigated along with its possible interaction with protein digestion. Minipigs were fed a complete meal with either cubed F & V (apple, plum, artichoke) added, or the corresponding phenolic extract (PE). Gastric and ileal chymes were kinetically collected over the postprandial period. The overall polyphenol bioaccessibility in the stomach was found to be 1.5% and 3.1% after F & V and PE consumption, respectively. The lower release rate from artichoke than from apple showed evidence of a plant effect. Flavanol monomers and glucoside conjugates were not recovered in the ileum in agreement with their absorption in the upper GIT. Interestingly, PE, but not F & V, significantly decreased the speed and efficiency of dietary protein digestion.

AB Cashew nuts are important both nutritionally and industrially, but can also cause food allergies in some individuals. The present study aimed to assess the effect(s) of industrial processing on anacardic acids and allergens present in cashew nuts. Sample analyses were performed using liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry, SDS-PAGE and immunoassay. The anacardic acid concentration ranged from 6.2 to 82.6 mg/g during processing, and this variation was attributed to cashew nut shell liquid incorporation during storage and humidification. Dehydrated and selected samples did not significantly differ in anacardic acid content, having values similar to the raw sample. SDS-PAGE and immunoassay analysis with rabbit polyclonal sera and human IgE indicated only minor differences in protein solubility and antibody binding following processing steps. The findings indicate that appreciable amounts of anacardic acid remain in processed nuts, and that changes to cashew allergens during industrial processing may only mildly affect antibody recognition.

AB The preservatives benzoic acid and sorbic acid are generally quantified with separation techniques, such as HPLC or GC. Here we describe a new method for determining these compounds in processed food samples based on a narrowness of the UV-visible spectral band width with derivative processing. It permits more selective identification and determination of target analytes in matrices. After a sample is purified by micro dialysis, UV spectra of sample solutions were measured and fourth order derivatives of the spectrum were calculated. The amplitude between the maximum and minimum values in a high-order derivative spectrum was used for the determination of benzoic acid and sorbic acid. Benzoic acid and sorbic acid levels in several commercially available processed foods were measured by HPLC and the proposed spectrometry method. The levels obtained by the two methods were highly correlated (r(2) > 0.97) for both preservatives.

AB A Quality Management Framework to improve quality and harmonization of Total Diet Study practices in Europe was developed within the TDS-Exposure Project. Seventeen processes were identified and hazards, Critical Control Points and associated preventive and corrective measures described. The Total Diet Study process was summarized in a flowchart divided into planning and practical (sample collection, preparation and analysis; risk assessment analysis and publication) phases. Standard Operating Procedures were developed and implemented in pilot studies in five organizations. The flowchart was used to develop a quality framework for Total Diet Studies that could be included in formal quality management systems. Pilot studies operated by four project partners were visited by project assessors who reviewed implementation of the proposed framework and identified areas that could be improved. The quality framework developed can be the starting point for any Total Diet Study centre and can be used within existing formal quality management approaches.

AB Sugar-free cranberry juice (XAD) and juice with 15% of maltodextrin were dried by freeze-, vacuum and spray drying methods. Total phenolics (589-6435 mg/kg dry matter) including 5 flavonols, 3 phenolic acids, 2 procyanidins and 5 anthocyanins were stronger affected by juice formulation than by drying methods. Spray drying of juice, regardless of its formulation, was competitive to freeze drying in terms of polyphenols' retention. Increase in temperature up to 100 degrees C during vacuum drying of XAD extracts resulted in degradation of polyphenolics (down to 4%), except chlorogenic acid. Its content increased with rise in temperature and accelerated hydroxymethylfurfural formation. The stronger the impact of drying, the more chlorogenic acid is present in cranberry products. In all powders analysed, formation of furoylmethyl amino acids was noted. Antioxidant capacity of cranberry products was influenced by juice formulation and was linked to content of polyphenols.

AB The aim of this work was to study the effect of three nixtamalization processes using wood ashes, Ca(OH)(2), and CaCl2 on the physicochemical properties of beans. Raw beans had C-type starch, 10.10% resistant starch (RS), and two DSC endotherms: 1) starch gelatinization, and 2) melting of amylose-lipid complexes plus protein denaturation. Nixtamalization increased the Ca and Fe content, decreased the RS content to 4.19-4.43%, and produced starch retrogradation. DSC and FT-IR analysis of the flours evidenced a "stabilizing" effect of cooking with NaCl and CaCl2 on bean proteins. In contrast, cooking with wood ashes and Ca(OH)(2) produced denaturation of bean proteins, decreasing the second transition enthalpy and absorption bands of amide I, II and III. Results showed that traditional and classic nixtamalization of beans are alternatives to obtaining mineral fortified flours that could be used as ingredients in the elaboration of foods with a good nutritional profile.

AB Ochratoxin A (OTA) is one of the main mycotoxins that can be found in food. The use of gamma radiation is a technique for preserving food that may exert some effects on mycotoxins. OTA was irradiated in its dry form, in aqueous and in methanolic solutions, and in wheat flour, grape juice and wine. Additionally, the toxicity of OTA irradiated in water was tested. In aqueous solutions, more than 90% of the OTA was degraded by gamma-radiation doses >= 2.5 kGy, and a 2-fold reduction in OTA cytotoxicity was observed. In food matrices, the elimination of OTA by gamma-radiation was found more difficult, as radiation doses of 30 kGy eliminate at most 24% of the OTA. Higher moisture content of food matrices did not substantially increase OTA elimination. It is concluded that OTA is very sensitive to irradiation in water solutions but resistant in its dry form and in food matrices.

AB The objectives of this study were to apply response surface methodology to optimize fat-soluble vitamin loading in re-assembled casein micelles, and to evaluate vitamin D stability of dry formulations during ambient or accelerated storage and in fortified fluid skim milk stored under refrigeration. Optimal loading of vitamin A (1.46-1.48 mg/100 mg casein) was found at 9.7 mM phosphate, 5.5 mM citrate and 30.0 mM calcium, while optimal loading of vitamin D (1.38-1.46 mg/100 mg casein) was found at 4.9 mM phosphate, 4.0 mM citrate and 26.1 mM calcium. In general, more vitamin D was retained in vitamin D-re-assembled casein micelles than control powders during storage, while vitamin D loss was not different for vitamin D-re-assembled casein micelles and control fortified milks after 21 days of refrigerated storage with light exposure. In conclusion, reassembled casein micelles with high loading efficiency show promise for improving vitamin D stability during dry storage.

AB The mucoadhesion between polymeric substances and mucosal membranes, widely exploited in the pharmaceutics industry to prolong drug residence, has been investigated as a means of retaining taste or aroma molecules in the oral cavity. This study shows that the mucoadhesive properties of carboxymethyl cellulose, a commonly used polysaccharide in the food and pharmaceutics industry, can modify retention, release and perception of sodium over time. A three-part study was designed coupling in vitro retention using ex vivo porcine tongue, sensory perception with a trained panel and in vivo retention of sodium ions in human volunteers. The findings suggest that although salt perception is stunted in samples containing a random coil, ionic, mucoadhesive thickener, the retention of sodium ions in the mouth is prolonged due to the mucoadhesive nature of the polysaccharide. Not only has this study-investigated mucoadhesion of liquid formulations in the oral cavity but it is also the first to link the mucoadhesive nature of a commonly used polysaccharide to the organoleptic properties of a food.

AB Substantial equivalence studies were performed in three Theobroma spp., cacao, bicolor and grandiflorum through chemical composition analysis and protein profiling of fruit (pulp juice and seeds). Principal component analysis of sugar, organic acid, and phenol content in pulp juice revealed equivalence among the three species, with differences in some of the compounds that may result in different organoleptic properties.
   Proteins were extracted from seeds and pulp juice, resolved by two dimensional electrophoresis and major spots subjected to mass spectrometry analysis and identification. The protein profile, as revealed by principal component analysis, was variable among the three species in both seed and pulp, with qualitative and quantitative differences in some of protein species. The functional grouping of the identified proteins correlated with the biological role of each organ. Some of the identified proteins are of interest, being minimally discussed, including vicilin, a protease inhibitor, and a flavonol synthase/flavanone 3-hydroxylase. Biological significance: Theobroma grandiflorum and Theobroma bicolor are endemic Amazonian plants that are poorly traded at the local level. As close relatives of Theobroma cacao, they may provide a good alternative for human consumption and industrial purposes. In this regard, we performed equivalence studies by conducting a comparative biochemical and proteomics analysis of the fruit, pulp juice and seeds of these three species. The results indicated equivalent chemical compositions and variable protein profiles with some differences in the content of the specific compounds or protein species that may result in variable organoleptic properties between the species and can be exploited for traceability purposes.

AB Six table grape cultivars (Centennial Seedless, Chasselas, Italia, Italia Rubi, Alphonse Lavallee, and Muscat de Hambourg) were analyzed for their levels of soluble solids, titratable acidity, sugars, organic acids, vitamin C and E, carotenoids, polyphenolics and volatile compounds during two successive years. Descriptive sensory analyses of the six table grape varieties were also performed. Mainly due to anthocyanins, black cultivars had the highest total phenolic contents. Alphonse Lavallee had also both the highest levels of trans-resveratrol and piceid, and Muscat de Hambourg the highest levels of a-tocopherol, alpha-carotene and monoterpenols, well-known key aroma compounds in Muscat varieties having also interesting pharmacological properties. This study shows that the two traditional black French cultivars, Muscat de Hambourg and Alphonse Lavalle, are particularly rich in bioactive compounds and have a great potential for human health. Finally, Muscat de Hambourg was significantly rated sweeter, juicier and more aromatic than the others cultivars.

AB A review of national nutrition surveys from 2000 to date, demonstrated high prevalence of vitamin D intakes below the EFSA Adequate Intake (AI) (< 15 mu g/d vitamin D) in adults across Europe. Dietary assessment and modelling are required to monitor efficacy and safety of ongoing strategic vitamin D fortification. To support these studies, a specialized vitamin D food composition dataset, based on EuroFIR standards, was compiled. The FoodEXplorer (TM) T tool was used to retrieve well documented analytical data for vitamin D and arrange the data into two datasets - European (8 European countries, 981 data values) and US (1836 data values). Data were classified, using the LanguaL (TM), FoodEX2 and ODIN classification systems and ranked according to quality criteria. Significant differences in the content, quality of data values, missing data on vitamin D-2 and 25(OH) D-3 and documentation of analytical methods were observed. The dataset is available through the EuroFIR platform.

AB This study aimed to characterize the brown lentil (Lens culinaris Medikus) starch and investigate the formation of amylose-lipid complexes (Resistant Starch Type V) by the addition of different lipids/fatty acids (10%, w/w) to both raw and cooked starch samples. Resistant starch content (measured by the official method of AACCI (Method 32-40), using the resistant starch assay kit) of raw brown lentil starch (BLS) increased significantly by the additions of lipids/fatty acids, starch sample complexed with HSO (hydrogenated sunflower oil) (14.1 +/- 0.4%) being the highest. For the cooked starch/lipid complexes, more profound effect was evident (22.2-67.7%). Peak, breakdown and trough viscosity values of the amylose-lipid complexed starches were significantly lower than that of BLS (p < 0.05), while significant decreases in the setback and final viscosities were only detected in oil samples, but not in fatty acids. Each lipid in concern exerted different effects on the digestibility of starch and amylose-lipid complex formation while having no substantial differential effects on the thermal properties of starch depicted by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). Amylose-lipid complex formation with suitable fatty acids/lipids seems a promising way of increasing resistant starch content of food formulations. Although the applications being quite uncommon yet, brown lentil seems to have potential both as a starch and also as a resistant starch source.

AB The failure of the antioxidant scavenging system in advanced ripening stages, causing oxidative stress, is one of the most important factor of fruit decay. Production of rich antioxidant fruit could represent a way to delay fruit senescence and preserve its characteristics. We investigated the antioxidant metabolites (ascorbate, glutathione, tocopherols, and polyphenols) and enzymes (ascorbic peroxidases, peroxidases and polyphenol oxidases) involved in the antioxidant response in forty-three accessions of sweet cherry fruits from Campania region.
   Our results highlight accessions with high antioxidant metabolites contents but low enzymatic activities. These represent important factors in both pre- and post-harvest on the qualitative and nutritional characteristics of sweet cherry. Observed differences are probably due to endogenous characteristics making these accessions particularly interesting for breeding programs aimed to improve fruit quality and shelf-life and for addressing the cultivation of a specific characterized cultivar based on the intended use, fresh consumption or processed products.

AB The electrochemical techniques were used to determine the total antioxidant capacity of breast milks and the results were compared with a commonly used spectrophotometric (2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl, DPPH) method. Breast milk from mothers of preterm infants was monitored in three lactation phases and after storage of expressed milk by monitoring changes in the total antioxidant capacity over a two year period. Statistical analysis showed there was no significant difference between the ability of the three methods to detect changes in breast milk after storage. Either of the electrochemical techniques studied could be successfully used to replace the time-consuming spectrophotometric method and can be applied to clinical trials.

On average, the Protein Digestibility-Corrected Amino Acid Score of red lentils 55.0) was higher than that of green lentils 50.8). Extruded lentil flour had higher scores 63.01 red, 57.09 green) than either cooked 57.40 red, 52.92 green) or baked 53.84 red, 47.14 green) flours. The average Digestible Indispensable Amino Acid Score of red lentils 0.54) was higher than green lentils 0.49). The Protein Efficiency Ratio of the extruded lentil flours 1.30 red, 1.34 green) was higher than that of the baked flour 0.98 red, 1.09 green). A correlation was found between in vivo and in vitro methods of determining protein digestibility R-2 = 0.8934). This work could influence selection of processing method during product development.

AB In 2010, the Directive on undesirable substances in animal feed entered into force and for the first time was laid down a maximum limit for nitrite content in sugar industry feed materials such as molasses and beet pulp. Due to a lack of suitable analytical methods for nitrite determination, this study was developed with the aim to standardize a nitrite analytical method in by-products from sugar industry.
   In this study high performance anion exchange chromatography with conductometric detection was used for determining nitrite and nitrate content of sugar by-products included in feed material.
   The study confirms the usefulness of the applied ion chromatographic method for the evaluation of the content of nitrite and nitrate in sugar by-products.
   The results showed that in many samples of beet pulp and molasses the content of "undesirable substances for animal feed" was below 15 mg kg(-1) (expressed as sodium nitrate at 12% of moisture).

AB Phycocyanins from cyanobacteria are possible sources for new natural blue colourants. Their chromophore, phycocyanobilin (PCB), was cleaved from the apoprotein by solvolysis in alcohols and alcoholic aqueous solutions. In all cases two PCB isomers were obtained, while different solvent adducts were formed upon the use of different reagents. The reaction is believed to take place via two competing pathways, a concerted E2 elimination and a S(N)2 nucleophilic substitution. Three cleavage methods were compared in terms of yield and purity: conventional reflux, sealed vessel heated in an oil bath, and microwave assisted reaction. The sealed vessel method is a new approach for fast cleavage of PCB from phycocyanin and gave at 120 degrees C the same yield within 30 min compared to 16 h by the conventional reflux method (P < 0.05). In addition the sealed vessel method resulted in improved purity compared to the other methods. Microwave irradiation increased product degradation.

AB The aim of the work is to compare the antioxidant activity of 4-vinylguaiacol (4-VQ) and 4-vinylsyringol (4-VS) added to stabilize three (flaxseed, olive and rapeseed) commercial oils. The phenolics were added at concentration of 20, 40 and 80 mg per 100 g of oil. The oils were oxidized in a Rancimat test at 110 degrees C. The linear dependences between the concentrations of each of these compounds and the induction period (IP) were found. Generally, 4-VQ was more effective, since the determined IP increase after its addition was from 5 to 25-fold higher than for the same addition of 4-VS. The highest increase was noted for flaxseed oil, for which 80 mg 4-VQ addition per 100 g of oil resulted in 50% IP increase. The highest absolute values of IP were reached by extra virgin olive oil, naturally abundant in phenolic compounds and with the lowest fatty acids oxidation index.

AB The objective of this study was to develop a method for authenticating organic milk samples in North Spain on the basis of its trace mineral composition. Fourteen elements in 98 samples were determined by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. Although concentrations of Co, Cr, Cu, I, Se and Zn where statistically higher in conventional milk and As in organic, none of these elements by itself was able to discriminate between organic and conventional milk. The chemical data was examined by principal component analysis and cluster analysis, revealing a natural separation between organic and conventional milk. In a second step, several supervised pattern recognition techniques were used to construct mathematical models for predicting the type of milk ( organic or conventional) based on the metal content. The results proved that the model constructed using the artificial neural network is capable of correctly identifying the type of milk in almost 95% of cases.

AB Malus domestica Borkh apples are one of the most consumed fruits in the world, due to their sweetness and flavour. Herein, 'Bravo de Esmolfe' apple fruits were characterized regarding their nutritional value, chemical composition and bioactive properties. Besides nutrients, flavan-3-ols (i.e., epicatechin and B-type procyanidins) as also hydroxycinnamoyl-quinic acids and phloretin derivatives were identified in the samples. Extracts prepared from 'Bravo de Esmolfe' also proved to have antioxidant activity and antibacterial effects against Gram-positive bacteria, namely methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Listeria monocytogenes and Enterococcus faecalis, and against the Gram-negative bacteria Escherichia coli, Escherichia coli (ESBL) (producing extended spectrum beta-lactamases) and Morganella morganii. There is very little information about 'Bravo de Esmolfe' apple, so this study is important to inform consumers about an alternative source of nutritional and bioactive compounds.

AB In the present work the possibility of using an untargeted metabolomic strategy to discriminate between common and durum wheat lipidome for an authenticity purpose was explored. A first study was conducted by analyzing 52 samples from two durum and common wheat varieties. Afterwards, an extended and independent sample set (173 samples and five varieties) was used as a confirmatory study to verify the stability and consistency of the models obtained. Putatively identified markers were evaluated applying ROC curves resulting in individual marker AUC > 90% both in preliminary and confirmatory study. In addition, digalactosyl diglyceride (DGDG) 36:4 was shown to be an effective marker differentiating between authentic durum wheat and its adulterated admixture down to 3% adulteration level, which is the maximum contamination level allowed by Italian legislation. The results demonstrated that untargeted lipidomics, in conjunction with chemometric tools has a significant potential for screening and detection of wheat fraud.

AB This investigation was performed to assess the effects of sonication on the structure of protein, extractability of phenolics, and biological properties of isolated proteins and protein co-precipitates prepared from brewers' spent grain and soybean flour. Scanning electron micrographs revealed that the sonicated protein isolates and co-precipitates had different microstructures with fewer aggregates and smaller particles down to the nanometer scale compared to non-sonicated samples. However, the levels of free and bound phenolics extracted from nonsonicated protein isolates and protein co-precipitates increased compared to sonicated samples. The bound phenolics extracted after acid hydrolysis of sonicated protein co-precipitates showed improved ACE inhibitory activity and diminished antioxidant potency compared to non-sonicated samples. However, the free phenolics extracted from sonicated protein co-precipitates showed decreased ACE inhibitory activity and increased antioxidant activities compared to non-sonicated samples. The free and bound phenolics extracted from sonicated protein co-precipitates showed increased alpha-amylase inhibitory activity compared to non-sonicated samples.

AB Carotenoids, tocols, phenolic acids and antioxidant capacity were studied during in vitro digestion of water biscuits (WB) from bread wheat, einkorn and einkorn-pseudocereals. Antioxidant and cytotoxic activities of digestates were also measured using a 70% Caco2/30% HT-29 human intestinal co-culture layer. Antioxidant profiles differed among WB formulations. Only hydrophilic molecules were solubilised by gastric digestion. After intestinal digestion, 77% carotenoids and 67% tocols were released. Soluble-conjugated phenolic acids increased (30%) and insoluble-bound forms decreased (17%), suggesting partial conversion from bound to conjugated form. After intestinal digestion, antioxidant capacity increased regardless of type and amount of antioxidants in undigested or digested WB. All WB, especially those with quinoa flour, reduced the AAPH pro-oxidant capacity in co-culture cells. These results highlight the potential health benefits of underutilized crops and the need for in vitro or in vivo models to better address potential bioactivity at intestinal and target organs level.

AB The reaction between 4-oxo-2-alkenals (fumaraldehyde, 4-oxo-2-hexenal, and 4-oxo-2-nonenal) and phenolic compounds (resorcinol and 2-methylresorcinol) was studied to characterize the trapping ability of phenolic compounds for these lipid oxidation products. The reaction occurred rapidly under neutral or slightly basic conditions and different carbonyl-phenol adducts were produced. However, these compounds were unstable and their stabilization had to be achieved by means of either acetylation or reduction with sodium borohydride. Three different kinds of adducts were isolated and characterized by using mass spectrometry (MS) and 1D and 2D nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR). They were benzofuran-6-ols, 2,3,3a, 8a-tetrahydrofuro[2,3b] benzofuran-2,6-diols, and chromane-2,7-diols. Most of them were produced as mixtures of diasteromers and all of them had a carbonyl group in a free form or as hemiacetal. A reaction pathway that explains the formation of these compounds is proposed. These results provide the basis to understand the removal of 4-oxo-2-alkenals by phenolic compounds in foods.

AB A characterization of the phenolic profile of 25 cocoa genotypes established in a Mexican gene bank was carried out. From five different extraction methods commonly used for phenols, extraction with acidified methanol-water was chosen as the best to quantify the concentrations of theobromine and individual phenols in cocoa beans. High concentrations of individual and total phenols were found for genotypes native to Mexico (like RIM105, M031, and M033) or from Peru and Ecuador (INI10), but not the commercial mix (CAF), and were directly associated with their antioxidant activities. Despite the loss of some theobromine and phenols during fermentation, epicatechin remained in the fermented cotyledon in high concentrations. This study could help promote the commercialization of Mexican genotypes of cocoa and reports the possibility of upcycling fermented cocoa husks, which are rich in bioactive compounds and fiber, as novel functional extracts for use in food formulation or for nutraceutical purposes.

AB The QUENCHER method is a time and cost-saving extraction-free procedure measuring in vitro antioxidant capacity which appears highly relevant from an industrial perspective. However, grinding and exact weighting of material may be considered as critical points and were addressed in the present paper. Increasing sample weight at constant ABTS volume reduced TEAC values up to 50%. Working at higher ABTS radical concentration than recommended furthermore increased the TEAC values by 30%. Both weight and ABTS concentration effect could yet be predicted using a general model built on refined wheat (adjusted R2: 0.9986). Only cryo-milling enabled to reduce granulometry of bran-rich samples in recommended range. Consequent size reduction increased TEAC values up to 90%. Impact of ultrafine jet-milling did however not systemically impact more TEAC values than cryo-milling. The proposed model approach allowed taking the best advantages of QUENCHER and confirmed this method as ideal for industrial applications.

AB The acid decomposition method was applied for the sample preparation of processed fruit juice. The decomposition of 15 mL of juice sample using HNO3 and H2O2 was performed in a digester block with reflux system and heated at 200 degrees C for 150 min. The limits of detection were 0.03; 0.24; 0.8; 0.008; 0.026 and 0.056 mg L-1 for Cr, Cu, K, Mg, Na and Zn, respectively and for Pb was 0.99 mu g L-1. The accuracy was evaluated by spiked experiments (80 to 119%). Four processed fruit juice samples commercialized in Brazil (strawberry, mango, peach, and orange) were analyzed and indicated the absence of Cr, Zn and Cu in the samples, except for Cu in strawberry juice. Pb was found in the mango juice sample (17.8 +/- 0.9 mu g L-1) and the concentration is below the maximum values recommended by Brazilian legislation for juices of citric fruits (0.3 mg kg(-1)).

AB Grape canes represent a promising source of bioactive phytochemicals. However the stabilization of the raw material after pruning remains challenging. We recently reported the induction of stilbenoid metabolism after winter pruning including a strong accumulation of E-resveratrol and E-piceatannol during the first six weeks of storage. In the present study, the effect of mechanical wounding on freshly-pruned canes was tested to increase the induction of stilbenoid metabolism. Cutting the grape canes in short segments immediately after pruning triggered a transient expression of phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL) and stilbene synthase (STS) genes, followed by a rapid accumulation of E-resveratrol and E-piceatannol. The degree of stilbenoid induction was related to the intensity of mechanical wounding. Data suggest that a global defense response is triggered involving jasmonate signaling, PR proteins and stilbenoid metabolism. Mechanical wounding of freshly-pruned canes drastically shortens the time required to reach maximal stilbenoid accumulation from 6 to 2 weeks.

AB Bioavailability of yerba mate phenolic compounds was assessed in healthy humans. More than 34 metabolites were identified in biological fluids, mainly sulfated conjugates of caffeic and ferulic/isoferulic acids, in addition to non-metabolized caffeoyl-,feruloyl- and p-coumaroilquinic acids, with rapid appearance and clearance in plasma indicative of small intestinal absorption. These compounds amounted to 13.1% of the urinary metabolites. Delayed absorption of dihydrocaffeic, dihydroferulic and dihydrocoumaric acids and their phase II metabolites, in addition to feruloylglycine, pointed to their microbial origin and colonic absorption, accounting for 81.0% of excreted metabolites. Phase II flavonol metabolites (0.2%) derived mainly from rutin after colonic transformation and absorption were also detected. Additionally, dihydroferuloyl-, dihydrocaffeoyl- and dihy-drocoumaroylquinic acids (5.7%) were identified, showing the most delayed kinetics. Total phenolic excretion (147.6 mu mol) corresponded to 13.2% of ingested phenols. In conclusion, yerba mate polyphenols are partially bioavailable and extensively metabolized, mainly by the colonic microbiota.

AB The study determines the antioxidant properties of methanol vegetable extracts from raw vegetables, conventionally cooked vegetables and sous-vide. In the research, two methods were used: free radical scavenging DPPH (mu M Trolox) and the reduction of Fe3+ to Fe2+ - FRAP (mu M Fe2+). Antioxidative properties for raw vegetables were obtained with the range of 7.47-235 (mu M Trolox/100 g of vegetables) and 2.66-103 (mu M Fe2+/100 g of vegetables), for vegetables after the conventional cooking process 6.15-657 (mu M Trolox/100 g of vegetables) and 3.03-99.9 (mu M Fe2+/100 g of vegetables), for vegetables after the sous-vide process 4.45-648 (mu M Trolox/100 g of vegetables) and 3.06-99.9 (mu M Fe2+/100 g of vegetables). For some vegetables, an increase in the antioxidative potential was observed as a result of cooking processes; however, it was much higher for the sous-vide technique. All results were subjected to a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and, if significant differences were revealed, the POST-HOC Duncan test was used (alpha = 0.05).

AB This study reports the formation of 2-furomethyl-amino acids (2-FM-AA) as indicators of Maillard reaction (MR) in black garlic elaboration, followed by the determination of furosine by ion-pair RP-HPLC-UV. The method was assessed for accuracy, repeatability and detection and quantitation limits indicating its adequacy. Traditional procedure of black garlic obtainment and the inclusion of convective drying (CDP) and ohmic heating (OHP) were assayed. For comparison purposes, three commercial black garlic samples were used. Together with furosine (2-FM-lysine), 2-furoylmethyl-gamma-aminobutyric acid and 2-FM-arginine were detected. Levels of furosine were higher in CDP (46.6-110.1 mg/100 g protein) than in OHP (13.7-42.0 mg/100 g protein) samples, probably due to the most severe processing conditions used in the former. These results highlight the suitability of 2-FM-AA as chemical indicators to monitor the process of black garlic elaboration in order to obtain high quality products.

AB Sorghum is a nutritionally dense grain but its nutritional quality is limited by its poor digestibility. The objective was to determine the effects of ultrasonication on the physicochemical properties of kafirin, major protein in sorghum, and its stability against pepsin-pancreatin hydrolysis (PPH). Ultrasonication for 10 min at 40% amplitude increased the solubility of purified kafirin from 6.5 mu g/mL to 173.3 mu g/mL. Ultrasonication altered the secondary structure of kafirin as evaluated by circular dichroism and Fourier-transform infrared red spectroscopy. In pepsin-pancreatin hydrolysates, 14.7% increase in molecules with molecular weight between 0.075 and 0.5 kDa was detected in size-exclusion chromatogram after ultrasonication at 40% amplitude, 10 min. The degree of hydrolysis was also increased after ultrasonication by 17.7%, 127.6%, 346.6% as measured by o-phthaldialdehyde derivatization, trichloroacetic acid precipitation and hydrochloric acid hydrolysis, respectively with improved antioxidant property. Our results showed the potential of ultrasonication to improve digestibility and biological properties of sorghum flour.

AB Microwave (MW) thermal heating has been proposed as an efficient method for honey liquefaction, while maintaining honey quality criteria. However, little is known about the effects of MW thermal heating on honey antibacterial activity. In this study, we aimed to determine the effects of MW heating on the antibacterial activity of raw rapeseed honeys against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus, with a particular focus on two major bee-derived antibacterial components, defensin-1 and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2).
   Our results demonstrated that MW thermal heating completely abolished honey antibacterial activity whereas conventional thermal treatment at 45 and 55 degrees C did not affect the antibacterial activity of honey samples. A significant decrease in both glucose oxidase activity and H2O2 production as well as defensin-1 amount was observed in MW-treated samples.
   Given that defensin-1 and H2O2 are regular antibacterial components of all honeys, MW heating may have similar negative effects on every type of crystallized/liquid honey.

AB Faba bean (Vicia faba L.) provides environmental and health benefits; however, the presence of the pyrimidine glycosides vicine and convicine (v-c) in its seeds limits consumption. Low v-c genotypes have been introduced, but the convicine levels in these genotypes have not been quantified. To improve detection, the polar nature of vc was exploited by implementing hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC). A sample preparation method using a two-step extraction was developed for use with UV and/or tandem mass spectrometry (SRM) detection. The HILIC-UV method was suitable for over three orders of magnitude, covering the range of v-c concentrations in faba bean seeds across all genotypes tested. The linear range of HILIC-SRM was slightly less (similar to 3 orders of magnitude), but improved sensitivity and selectivity make it more suitable for quantifying low v-c samples. The analysis of 13 genotypes suggests that v-c concentrations in faba bean seeds may be independent quantitative traits.

AB This study investigates the effects of tomato puree fortification with several anthocyanin-rich food colorants on bioactive compound content (phenolics, isoprenoids), antioxidant capacity, in vitro biological activities and consumer acceptance.
   Tomato puree (tp) was added with different anthocyanin extracts from black carrot (Anthocarrot), grape fruit skins (Enocolor), elderberry fruits (Elderberry) or mahaleb cherry fruits (Mahaleb), thus obtaining a 'functional tomato puree' (ftp). The consumer acceptance (colour, flavor, taste, visual appearance) was at high level, except for Mahaleb-added ftp. Compared to the control (tp), the addition of colouring extracts increased significantly the total phenolic content, before pasteurization, in addition to the expected anthocyanin content. However, after pasteurization, mostly Anthocarrot-ftp preserved an increased phenolic (+53%) content, as well as a higher antioxidant capacity (50%), more than the other added-extracts.
   Consistently, against tp, Anthocarrot-ftp exhibited an increased anti-inflammatory capacity as showed by the reduced expression of vascular cell adhesion molecule (VCAM)-1 in human cultured endothelial cells, under inflammatory conditions.

AB Gastrointestinal stability of zinc-peptide complexes is essential for zinc delivery. As peptide surface charge can influence their metal complex stability, we evaluated the zinc-chelating capacity and stability of zinc complexes of whey protein hydrolysates (WPH), produced with Everlase (WPH-Ever; xi-potential, -39 mV) and papain (WPH-Pap; xi-potential, -7 mV), during simulated digestion. WPH-Ever had lower amount of zinc-binding amino acids but showed higher zinc-chelating capacity than WPH-Pap. This is attributable to the highly anionic surface charge of WPH-Ever for electrostatic interaction with zinc. Release of zinc during peptic digestion was lower for WPH-Ever-zinc, and over 50% of zinc remained bound in both peptide complexes after peptic-pancreatic digestion. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy suggests the involvement of carboxylate ion, and sidechain carbon-oxygen of aspartate/glutamate and serine/threonine in zinc-peptide complexation. The findings indicate that strong zinc chelation can promote gastric stability and impede intestinal release, for peptides intended for use as dietary zinc carriers.

AB The detection of mutant DNA is critical for precision medicine, but low-frequency DNA mutation is very hard to be determined. CRISPR/Cas9 is a robust tool for in vivo gene editing, and shows the potential for precise in vitro DNA cleavage. Here we developed a DNA mutation detection system based on CRISPR/Cas9 that can detect gene mutation efficiently even in a low-frequency condition. The system of CRISPR/Cas9 cleavage in vitro showed a high accuracy similar to traditional T7 endonuclease I (T7E1) assay in estimating mutant DNA proportion in the condition of normal frequency. The technology was further used for low-frequency mutant DNA detection of EGFR and HBB somatic mutations. To the end, Cas9 was employed to cleave the wild-type (WT) DNA and to enrich the mutant DNA. Using amplified fragment length polymorphism analysis (AFLPA) and Sanger sequencing, we assessed the sensitivity of CRISPR/Cas9 cleavage-based PCR, in which mutations at 1%-10% could be enriched and detected. When combined with blocker PCR, its sensitivity reached up to 0.1%. Our results suggested that this new application of CRISPR/Cas9 system is a robust and potential method for heterogeneous specimens in the clinical diagnosis and treatment management.

AB The aim of this study was to investigate the possible effects of EPHX1 and VKORC1L1 polymorphisms on variability of responses to warfarin. Sixteen single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 201 patients with stable warfarin doses were analyzed including genes of VKORC1, CYP2C9, CYP4F2, GGCX, EPHX1 and VKORC1L1. Univariate analysis was conducted for the association of genotypes with stable warfarin doses. Multiple linear regression analysis was used to investigate factors that independently affected the inter-individual variability of warfarin dose requirements. The rs4072879 of VKORC1L1 (A > G) was significantly associated with stable warfarin doses; wild homozygote carriers (AA) required significantly lower stable warfarin doses than those with the variant G allele (5.02 +/- 1.56 vs. 5.96 +/- 2.01 mg; p = 0.001). Multivariate analysis showed that EPHX1 rs1877724 and VKORC1L1 rs4072879 accounted for 1.5% and 1.3% of the warfarin dose variability. Adding EPHX1 and VKORC1L1 SNPs to the base model including non-genetic variables (operation age, body weight and the therapy of ACEI or ARB) and genetic variables (VKORC1 rs9934438, CYP2C9 rs1057910, and CYP4F2 rs2108622) gave a number needed to genotype of 34. This study showed that polymorphisms of EPHX1 and VKORC1L1 could be determinants of stable warfarin doses.

AB The chemokine ligand C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 12 (CXCL12) is a kind of small molecules of cytokines that widely expressed in diversified tissues. Recent evidence suggests that CXCL12 plays an important role in the communication of tumor cells with their surrounding microenvironment. The interaction of CXCL12 and its receptors subsequently excite the downstream signaling pathways to affect tumor angiogenesis, tumor cell proliferation and chemoresistance, and thus represents a potential target for cancer therapy. Outpouring molecules targeting CXCL12/CXCR4 axis in tumor microenvironment combined with traditional chemotherapy have drawn more and more attentions, which will be a promising method in anti-cancer therapies. Our review focuses on these roles of CXCL12 and summarizes strategies for treating cancer by disrupting this interaction with special emphasis on the CXCR4/CXCL12 axis.

AB Chronic myelocytic leukemia cell line K562 undergoes differentiation by phorbol esters to megakaryocytes and we have used this system to understand miRNA processing leading to isomiR generation. PMA treatment significantly altered the production of miRNA in K562 cells. Expression of 24.4% of miRNAs were found to be stimulated whereas expression of 10% miRNAs were inhibited by PMA treatment. Our results suggest that miRNA precursors are processed into isomiRs in a deterministic manner. The relative levels of different isomiRs of a miRNA remained mainly unchanged even after PMA treatment irrespective of overall changes in expression (either up-regulation or down-regulation). However, not all miRNAs behave in the same way, about 7% showed a variation of isomiR profiles after PMA treatment. Most of the later class of miRNAs were found to be oncogenic miRNAs. Further, it was also found that number of isomiRs was independent of abundance of a miRNA. Functional importance of different isomiRs was demonstrated using three different isomiRs of miR-22. Our results showed that different isomiRs could inhibit expression of targets genes with different efficiencies. Our study suggests that the heterogeneity of a miRNA population generated during processing is in general regulated and that variation in the generation of an isomiR can be a functionally important regulatory feature.

AB MiR-93-5p has been previously found to be associated with gastric cancer (GC) tumorigenesis; however, the current understanding of its function in this context remains largely incomplete. In the present study, we showed that miR-93-5p was upregulated in GC tissues. We also demonstrated that miR-93-5p overexpression promoted the proliferation, migration, invasion, and chemoresistance of SGC-7901 cells in vitro, and conversely, that endogenously silencing miR-93-5p expression induced the opposite effects in HGC-27 cells. Overexpression of miR-93-5p was found to inactivate the Hippo pathway, and furthermore, miR-93-5p knockdown activated Hippo signaling. MiR-93-5p upregulation was also shown to inhibit the expression of two well-characterized Hippo pathway regulators, protocadherin Fat 4 (FAT4), and large tumor suppressors 2 (LATS2), at both the mRNA and protein level. Additionally, the results of bioinformatics analyses and luciferase reporter assays indicated that miR-93-5p directly targets the 3'-UTR of FAT4 and LATS2. Taken together, these results demonstrate that miR93-5p promotes GC-cell progression via the inactivation of the Hippo signaling pathway, and thus, represents a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of GC.

AB MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have emerged as critical regulators for cancer development and progression of human melanoma. However, the potential molecular mechanism of miR-767 in human melanoma has not been intensively investigated. In this present study, we confirmed that miR-767 was frequently up-regulated in human melanoma tissues and cell lines. Ectopic expression of miR-767 promoted cell proliferation in human melanoma cell lines A375 and WM35, whereas miR-767-in reversed the function. Bioinformatics analysis revealed that cylindromatosis (CYLD) was hypothesized to be a possible target gene of miR-767, and this was confirmed by luciferase activity assay. Knockdown of CYLD counteracted the proliferation arrest by miR-767-in in melanoma cells A375 and WM35. In conclusion, our study indicated that miR-767 acted as a role of tumor promoter by targeting CYLD in human melanoma, and might serve as a prognostic or therapeutic target for human melanoma.

AB Hypermodified bases present at 3'-adjacent (37th) position in anticodon loop of tRNA(Phe) are well known for their contribution in modulating codon-anticodon interactions. Peroxywybutosine (o2yW), a wyosine family member, is one of such tricyclic modified bases observed at the 37th position in tRNA(Phe). Conformational preferences and three-dimensional structural analysis of peroxywybutosine have not been investigated in detail at atomic level. Hence, in the present study quantum chemical semi-empirical RM1 and multiple molecular dynamics (MD) simulations have been used to study structural significance of peroxywybutosine in tRNA(Phe). Full geometry optimizations over the peroxywybutosine base have also been performed using ab-initio HF-SCF (6-31G**), DFT (B3LYP/6-31G**) and semi-empirical PM6 method to compare the salient properties. RM1 predicted most stable structure shows that the amino-carboxy-propyl side chain of o2yW remains 'distal' to the five membered imidazole ring of tricyclic guanosine. MD simulation trajectory of the isolated peroxy base showed restricted periodical fluctuations of peroxywybutosine side chain which might be helpful to maintain proper anticodon loop structure and mRNA reading frame during protein biosynthesis process. Another comparative MD simulation study of the anticodon stem loop with codon UUC showed various properties, which justify the functional implications of peroxywybutosine at 37th position along with other modified bases present in ASL of tRNA(Phe). Thus, this study presents an atomic view into the structural properties of peroxywybutosine, which can be useful to determine its role in the anticodon stem loop in context of codon-anticodon interactions and frame shift mutations.

AB Background: Hypochondroplasia (HCH; OMIM 146000) is a common autosomal dominant skeletal dysplasia characterized by disproportionate short stature, short extremities, relative macrocephaly, and lumbar lordosis. Because of its clinical and genetic heterogeneity, gene mutational analysis is particularly important in diagnosis and the phenotypes may be ameliorated if diagnosed early.
   Materials and methods: In this study, we examined a Chinese family with HCH, performed an inductive analysis of their clinical features and radiographic results, and applied targeted exome sequencing (TES) technology to perform a molecular diagnosis.
   Results: The proband and his mother all presented disproportionate short stature, short, stubby extremities, unchanged interpedicular distances from L1 - L5, and short iliac bones, with a 'fish mouth -shaped' sciatic notch. The mother received induced abortion recently because an ultrasound showed short femur length of her fetus at 24-week gestation. Eventually, a novel heterozygous mutation (c.1145G > A) in FGFR3 was identified by TES in the proband, his mother, and her fetus; this causes the substitution of glycine with aspartic acid in codon 382.
   Conclusions: In this study, we diagnosed a Chinese pedigree with HCH based on clinical data, radiographic features, and genetic testing results. Our results extend the genetic mutation spectrum of FGFR3 and demonstrate that TES is an effective method for the diagnosis of skeletal dysplasia in clinical practices.

AB Identification of new polymorphic variants from RNA-seq data is difficult mainly because of the errors arising during bioinformatic analysis. Therefore, new experiments in this area are very profitable for improving new statistical methods. In our study of the porcine brain transcriptome, we have identified 10966 polymorphic variants, among which 7277 were single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Further, we have calculated allelic ratios for the SNPs identified and estimated that 52% of genes in porcine brain are subjected to allele-specific expression (ASE), a phenomenon in which one allele is preferentially expressed. Our investigation presents the first estimates of ASE in porcine brain. In addition, we have used the results of RNA-seq for the identification of SNPs in putatively imprinted genes. Finally, we have used these SNPs for the verification of the imprinted status of the INPP5f variant 2, LRRTM1 and HM13 genes in pigs by Sanger sequencing. We observed that INPP5f variant 2 is paternally expressed, while HM13 and LRRTM1 are biallelically expressed in porcine brain. We have also confirmed maternal expression of the MEG3 gene in pigs. Our results present how RNA-seq data may be used for imprinting studies without sequencing of parental genomes.

AB In this study, a temperature and ROS-responsive drug delivery system ROSP@MSN based on mesoporous silica nanoparticles has been designed and synthesized by taking advantage of 4-(4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxaborolan-2-yl) benzyl acrylate modified polymers (ROSP) as "nano-valve", which can respond selectively to cancer exclusive microenvironment and implement targeted drug release. Due to the superior temperature-sensitive properties of ROSP, ROSP@MSN could achieve cargo loading in cold water, and subsequently close the pore by raising temperature to obtain ROSP@MSN@DOX. Upon the stimulus of ROS, ROSP@MSN@DOX shows good release performance at physiological conditions. The cytotoxicity study demonstrates that the cell viability is about 80% after Hela cells are treated with ROSP@MSN at a concentration of 100 mu g/mL for 24 h, exhibiting the good biocompatibility of ROSP@MSN. Furthermore, after treated with ROSP@MSN@DOX at a concentration of 100 mu g/mL for 24 h, the viability of Hela cells is reduced to 40.5%; Control experiments demonstrate that, when Hela cells are pretreated with active oxygen scavenger, cell viability is about 65.3% due to the significant decrease of intracellular reactive oxygen species. Therefore, the therapeutic nanocarrier with effective encapsulation and release capacity in particular situation is a great candidate for the new drug delivery platform for targeted cancer therapy.

AB Cystic Fibrosis (CF), the most common chronic genetic disorder among the Caucasian population, is a life-threatening disease mainly due to respiratory failures resulting from chronic infections and inflammation. Although research in the pharmacological field has recently made significant progress, gene therapy still remains a promising strategy to cure CF, especially because it should be applicable to any patient whatever the mutation profile. Until now, little attention has been paid to bacterial lung infections with regard to gene delivery to the airways; yet, this could greatly impact on the success of gene therapy. Previously, we have reported arsonium-containing lipophosphoramides as poly-functional nanocarriers capable of simultaneous antibacterial action against Gram-positive bacteria and gene transfer into eukaryotic cells. In the present work, we show that such nanoparticles can also be combined with an N-heterocyclic carbene-silver complex in order to extend the spectrum of antibacterial activity, including towards the Gram-negative Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Importantly, this is demonstrated not only using standard in vitro protocols but also a clinically-relevant aerosol delivery method. Furthermore, antibacterial effects are compatible with efficient and safe gene delivery into human bronchial epithelial cells. The poly-functionality of combinations of such chemical compounds may thus show benefits for CF lung gene therapy.

AB We have developed a tumor environment-responsive polymeric anticancer prodrug containing pirarubicin (THP) conjugated to N-(2-hydroxypropyl) methacrylamide copolymer (PHPMA), [P-THP], through a spacer containing pH-sensitive hydrazone bond, that showed remarkable therapeutic effect against various tumor models and in a human pilot study. Toward clinical development, here we report THP release profile from its HPMA copolymer conjugate, the conjugate stability, protein and cell-binding and solubility of P-THP. Size exclusion chromatography of P-THP (molecular weight 38 kDa) showed similar hydrodynamic volume as bovine serum albumin (BSA) in aqueous solution, with no apparent interactions with BSA, nor aggregation by itself. pH-responsive release of free THP was reconfirmed at pHs 6.5 and lower. The drug release was significantly affected by a type of used buffer. Phosphate buffer seems to facilitate faster hydrazone bond cleavage at pH 7.4 whereas higher stability was achieved in L-arginine solution which yielded only little cleavage and THP release, approx. 15% within 2 weeks at the same pH at 25 degrees C. Furthermore, ex vivo study using sera of different animal species showed very high stability of P-THP. Incubation with blood showed high stability of P-THP during circulation, without binding to blood cells. These findings revealed that L-arginine solution provides appropriate media for formulation of P-THP infusion solution as tumor-targeted polymeric anticancer drug based on EPR effect.

AB The use of inkjet printing (IJP) technology enables the flexible manufacturing of personalized medicine with the doses tailored for each patient. In this study we demonstrate, for the first time, the applicability of IJP in the production of edible dosage forms in the pattern of a quick response (QR) code. This printed pattern contains the drug itself and encoded information relevant to the patient and/or healthcare professionals. IJP of the active pharmaceutical ingredient (API)-containing ink in the pattern of QR code was performed onto a newly developed porous and flexible, but mechanically stable substrate with a good absorption capacity. The printing did not affect the mechanical properties of the substrate. The actual drug content of the printed dosage forms was in accordance with the encoded drug content. The QR encoded dosage forms had a good print definition without significant edge bleeding. They were readable by a smartphone even after storage in harsh conditions. This approach of efficient data incorporation and data storage combined with the use of smart devices can lead to safer and more patient-friendly drug products in the future.

AB Fused deposition modelling (FDM) 3D printing (3DP) is a revolutionary technology with the potential to transform drug product design in both the pre-clinical and clinical arena. The objective of this pilot study was to explore the intestinal behaviour of four different polymer-based devices fabricated using FDM 3DP technology in rats. Small capsular devices of 8.6 mm in length and 2.65 mm in diameter were printed from polyvinyl alcoholpolyethylene glycol graft-copolymer (PVA-PEG copolymer, Kollicoat IR), hydroxypropylcellulose (HPC, Klucel), ethylcellulose (EC, Aqualon N7) and hypromellose acetate succinate (HPMCAS, Aquasolve-LG). A smaller sized device, 3.2 mm in length and 2.65 mm in diameter, was also prepared with HPMCAS to evaluate the cut off size of gastric emptying of solid formulations in rats. The devices were radiolabelled with Fluorodeoxyglucose (F-18-FDG) and small animal positron emission tomography/computed tomography (microPET/CT) was used to track the movement and disintegration of the fabricated devices in the rats. The PVA-PEG copolymer and HPC devices disintegrated after 60min following oral administration. The EC structures did not disintegrate in the gastrointestinal tracts of the rats, whereas the HPMCAS-based systems disintegrated after 420 min. Interestingly, it was noted that the devices which remained intact over the course of the study had not emptied from the stomach of the rats. This was also the case with the smaller sized device. In summary, we report for the first time, the use of a microPET/CT imaging technique to evaluate the in vivo behaviour of 3D printed formulations. The manipulation of the 3D printed device design could be used to fabricate dosage forms of varying sizes and geometries with better gastric emptying characteristics suitable for rodent administration. The increased understanding of the capabilities of 3DP in dosage form design could, henceforth, accelerate pre-clinical testing of new drug candidates in animal models.

AB Design of Experiment-assisted evaluation of critical process (total flow rate, TFR, flow rate ratio, FRR) and formulation (polymer concentration and structure, drug: polymer ratio) variables in a novel microfluidics-based device, a staggered herringbone micromixer (SHM), for poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) copolymer (PLGA) nano-particles (NPs) manufacturing was performed in order to systematically evaluate and mathematically describe their effects on NPs sizes and drug encapsulation; a small hydrophilic moiety, N-acetylcysteine, was chosen as challenging model drug. SHM-assisted nanoprecipitation method consistently yielded NPs with tailor made sizes (in the range of 100-900 nm) and polydispersity index range from 0.061 to 0.286. Significant effects on NPs sizes were highlighted for TFR and FRR: increasing TFR (from 5 to 15 mL/min) and decreasing FRR (from 1:1 to 1:5 v/v, acetonitrile: buffer) NPs with mean diameter <= 200 nm were obtained. SHM technique allowed for flexible, application-specific tuning of PLGA NPs size using organic solvents with relatively low toxicity (acetone, acetonitrile), varying aqueous phase composition (Tris buffer vs PVA aqueous solution) and PLGA characteristics (Mw ranging from 25-90 kDa, capped or un-capped PLGA, different lactide: glycolide molar ratio). A very satisfactory N-Ac encapsulation efficiency (more than 67%) and a prolonged release (by 168 h) were achieved.

AB Paclitaxel (PTX) and docetaxel (DTX) are highly effective chemotherapeutic agents against breast cancer cells. Existing PTX and DTX formulations, however, contain excipients that result in a multitude of side-effects. The objective of the present study was to develop novel self-microemulsifying formulations of PTX and DTX with significantly lower excipient content by utilizing the high solubility of taxanes in sulforaphane (SFN). SFN-enabled microemulsions were developed by a screening process in which optical microscopy and absorbance data were used to monitor the physical stability of the dispersions. Optimized formulations contained vitamin E TPGS and transcutol to aid in taxane dissolution in water and the formation of transparent microemulsions (< 20 nm). SFN microemulsions were stable in different dilution media and storage temperatures and had no hemolytic effect on RBCs. When tested in vitro against MDA-MB-231 and MCF7 cancer cells by IncuCyte (R) live cell analysis and CellTiter-Blue (R) assay, taxanes/SFN microemulsions showed similar activity as the commercial taxanes injection solutions. SFN was only found to potentiate the activity of taxanes when used at high concentrations. This study highlighted the unique properties of SFN and its potential use in reformulating taxanes with high drug load and significantly lower excipient content than the commercial products.

AB This study demonstrates the preparation of a silybin-loaded N-octyl-O, N-carboxymethyl chitosan micelle (OCC-SLB) to enhance the oral absorption efficiency of silybin (SLB) and investigate the related mechanisms of enhancement. Firstly, the physicochemical properties of OCC and OCC-SLB micelles, including critical micelle concentration (CMC), particle size, zeta potential, drug-loading, etc., were determined. Results of pharmacokinetic studies on rats then confirmed a desirable enhancement in the oral bioavailability of SLB by OCC-SLB micelles compared with a stock SLB suspension solution. Subsequently, uptake studies on the Caco-2 cell line demonstrated that OCC-SLB micelles effectively accumulated SLB or rhodamine-123 into cells through clathrin and caveolae-mediated endocytosis and the inhibition of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) efflux. In addition, results of the Caco-2 transport study further clarified that OCC-SLB micelles enhanced the permeability of SLB via tight junction opening and clathrin-mediated transcytosis across the endothelium. These findings indicated the OCC micelle platform as a potential delivery vehicle for oral administration of P-gp substrates such as SLB.

AB It was the aim of this study to develop high drug loaded (> 30%, w/w), thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU)-based dosage forms via fused deposition modelling (FDM). Model drugs with different particle size and aqueous solubility were pre-processed in combination with diverse TPU grades via hot melt extrusion (HME) into filaments with a diameter of 1.75 +/- 0.05 mm. Subsequently, TPU-based filaments which featured acceptable quality attributes (i.e. consistent filament diameter, smooth surface morphology and good mechanical properties) were printed into tablets. The sustained release potential of the 3D printed dosage forms was tested in vitro. Moreover, the impact of printing parameters on the in vitro drug release was investigated. TPU-based filaments could be loaded with 60% (w/w) fine drug powder without observing severe shark skinning or inconsistent filament diameter. During 3D printing experiments, HME filaments based on hard TPU grades were successfully converted into personalized dosage forms containing a high concentration of crystalline drug (up to 60%, w/w). In vitro release kinetics were mainly affected by the matrix composition and tablet infill degree. Therefore, this study clearly demonstrated that TPU-based FDM feedstock material offers a lot of formulation freedom for the development of personalized dosage forms.

AB The effects of solvents upon the deposition of a moderately lipophilic solute on skin and skin permeation were investigated previously. The present study was a continuing effort to investigate the effects of solvents on finite dose skin absorption of nonvolatile lipophilic and polar solutes and examine the relationships between solute physicochemical properties, solvent effects, and skin absorption of these solutes after solvent deposition. Skin permeation experiments under the finite dose conditions were conducted with model solutes (corticosterone, urea, mannitol, glycerol, triamcinolone acetonide, and estradiol) and model solvents (ethanol, butanol, water, and propylene glycol) using Franz diffusion cells and human epidermal membrane. Urea showed unexpectedly high skin permeation under the finite dose conditions compared to the other solutes based on their skin permeability coefficients (obtained under infinite dose condition). The influences of the solvents on solute permeation suggest that these solvents did not act solely as a vehicle for spreading the solutes during solvent deposition. In the testing of skin permeation mechanisms, model analyses indicated a correlation between solute permeation and their molecular weights and solubilities, suggesting that the solute permeation mechanism with the volatile solvent was related to solute dissolution on the skin surface and its diffusion across the skin.

AB Cinchonidine and Theophylline vitrification abilities have been investigated by differential and fast scanning calorimetry. These active pharmaceutical compounds are known in the literature to have a very high tendency to crystallize which has been confirmed by classical differential scanning calorimetry. Due to the growing interest in amorphous pharmaceutical compounds, their possible vitrifications have been investigated by fast scanning calorimetry. This work shows the high potential of this advanced thermal analysis technique to investigate the vitrification of active pharmaceutical compounds by melt-quenching protocol. For the first time, glass transitions of Cinchonidine and Theophylline were measured. From Cinchonidine, it has been shown that complete glassy state can be obtained by cooling from the melt at 2000 K/s. Crystallization has also been suppressed by cooling down from the melt at 2 K/s. However, such rate does not avoid the formation of nuclei. Theophylline crystallization process has been suppressed by a melt-quenching protocol carried out with a cooling rate of 4000 K/s. However, the phenomenon of nuclei formation upon cooling seems unavoidable at this cooling rate. For both active pharmaceutical compounds, physical aging has been observed to play a role on the nuclei formation below the glass transition leading to modify the subsequent crystallization.

AB N-(2-Hydroxypropyl) methacrylamide (HPMA) copolymer has been extensively studied as drug carrier for tumor therapy. Due to the Enhanced Permeability and Retention (EPR) effect, HPMA copolymer drug conjugates are able to be passively accumulated in the tumor site. Currently, efficient uptake of this polymeric system by the cancer cells remains a big challenge, as HPMA polymer is highly hydrophilic, neutrally charged, and has low affinity towards cell membrane. In this study, selective and enhanced intracellular internalization of the copolymer-drug conjugates was achieved by utilizing a hybrid strategy including ligand modification and stimuli response. This hybrid approach was rationally designed to comprise cationic HPMA copolymer backbone as drug carrier, doxorubicin (Dox) as model drug, hydrazone bond as drug spacer, FQSIYPpIK (FQS) peptide as alpha(v)beta(3) targeting ligand and 2, 3-Dimethylmaleic Anhydride (DMA) as a shielded/deshielded cationic group. We demonstrated our system exhibited the "seek-and-destroy" tumor tropic behavior by sequentially undergoing the following steps: (i) tumor passive targeting mediated by EPR effect; (ii) charge reversal at tumor extracellular pH of 6.5; (iii) synergistically enhanced cell uptake via electrostatic interaction with cell membrane and FQS ligandmediated bio-recognition; (iv) drug released in the lysosome; and v) anticancer effect exerted by the targeted delivery of the Dox.

The process of development and characterization of the NPs in terms of size, surface charge, encapsulation efficiency (EE), morphology, in vitro drug release, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), in vitro assessment of mucoadhesive property, cell viability and permeability studies are documented. Results showed that the SLNs had a smooth spherical shape with a size of ca. 245-344 nm and with a zeta potential around -30 mV for SLNs and +40 mV for C-SLNs. The surface charge variation from negative to positive charge and FTIR analysis demonstrated the successful process of coating the nanoparticles (NPs) surface with chitosan. The DSC thermograms were in agreement with the nanostructure of the SLNs. The EE of drug was found to be higher than 90% and the loading capacity (LC) around 4.5%. C-SLNs show higher in vitro muchoadesive properties and a higher permeability in alveolar epithelial cells A549 than uncoated SLNs, indicating that the developed C-SLNs can be used as a promising carrier for sasfer and efficient management of TB.

AB Cryptosporidium is a ubiquitous protozoan parasite causing gastrointestinal disorder in various hosts worldwide. The disease is self-limiting in the immunocompetent but life-threatening in immunodeficient individuals. Investigations to find an effective drug for the complete elimination of the Cryptosporidium infection are ongoing and urgently needed. The current study was undertaken to examine the anti-cryptosporidial efficacy of curcumin in experimentally infected mice compared with that of paromomycin. Oocysts were isolated from a pre-weaned dairy calf and identified as Cryptosporidium parvum using a nested- polymerase chain reaction (PCR) on Small subunit ribosomal ribonucleic acid (SSU rRNA) gene and sequencing analysis. One hundred and ten female BALB/c mice were divided into five groups. Group 1 was infected and treated with curcumin; Group 2 infected and treated with paromomycin; Group 3 infected without treatment; Group 4 included uninfected mice treated with curcumin, and Group 5 included uninfected mice treated with distilled water for 11 successive days, starting on the first day of oocyst shedding. The oocyst shedding was recorded daily. At days 0, 3, 7, and 11 of post treatments, five mice from each group were killed humanly; jejunum and ileum tissue samples were processed for histopathological evaluation and counting of oocyst on villi, simultaneously. Furthermore, total antioxidant capacity (TAC) and malondialdehyde (MDA) concentrations in affected tissues were also measured in different groups. By treatments, tissue lesions and the number of oocyst on villi of both jejunum and ileum were decreased with a time-dependent manner. In comparison with Group 3, oocyst shedding was stopped at the end of treatment period in both groups 1 and 2 without recurrence at 10 days after drug withdrawal. Also, TAC was increased and the MDA concentrations were decreased in Group 1. Moreover, paromomycin showed acceptable treatment outcomes during experiment and its anti-cryptosporidial activity was faster than curcumin. The results confirmed the anti-cryptosporidial and antioxidant activity of curcumin against C. parvum and further evaluation of immunosuppressed animal models needs to be carried out.

AB Giardia duodenalis is an important intestinal protozoan parasite with a wide range of hosts, including humans, livestock and wildlife. The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence of G. duodenalis infections among cattle and sheep in the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau Area (QTPA) and to assess the potential risk of the zoonotic transmission of this pathogen. A total of 454 stool specimens were collected and examined using the nested PCR method based on the G. duodenalis SSUrRNA gene fragment. Thirty-nine out of 389 cattle specimens examined were positive (10%) for the G. duodenalis infection. After the sequence analysis of the SSUrRNA gene, all detected G. duodenalis belong to assemblage E. No G. duodenalis infections were found in the 65 investigated samples from sheep. Our data therefore indicates that G. duodenalis is a common parasite in cattle in the QTPA, China and that cattle appear to be a reservoir of G. duodenalis for other animals and the environmental water supplies in the area.

AB Rhipicephalus microplus is a vector of cattle tick fever, a disease caused by the protozoans Babesia bovisand B. bigemina, and also anaplasmosis, produced by the Rickettsiales Anaplasma marginale. These tick-borne pathogens cause considerable losses to Brazilian livestock breeders and represent an obstacle to the expanded use of taurine breeds due to their higher sensitivity to ticks and hemoparasites compared to zebu breeds. Differences in the susceptibility to hemoparasites were also verified within breeds, suggesting that may be possible to select a most resistant phenotype. Therefore, repeatability of R. microplus counts and copy number of hemoparasites DNA were estimated, along with correlations between themselves, aiming to verify if those measures can be used as parameters to classify animals according to their parasite resistance degrees. Forty-two Canchim females kept on pastures naturally infested by ticks were evaluated for the level of infestation by R. microplus and infection by B. bovis, B. bigemina, and A. marginale. Twenty-four evaluations were performed once a month, for adult female ticks counts and blood samplings. The experimental period was divided into four phases, according to the animals age range: Phase 1: 8 to 13 months (collections 1 to 6); phase 2: 14 to 19 months (collections 7 to 12); phase 3: 20 to 25 months (collections 13 to 18), and phase 4: 26 to 31 months (collections 19 to 24). Blood samples were submitted to absolute quantification of hemoparasites DNA sequences using qPCR. The hemoparasite and tick counts data were transformed for normalization and were analyzed using mixed models. Among three species of hemoparasites studied, A. marginale presented the highest level of infection. During phase 3, B. bigemina presented higher infection levels (p < 0.05) compared to B. bolds, whereas no differences were observed in other phases. Estimated repeatabilities for parasite infection levels varied from low to moderate during our experiment. There were low correlations between tick counts and parasite infection levels, and between parasite infection levels from different species by themselves. Based on these results, under conditions of the present study, we suggest that it is possible to identify animals presenting a most resistant phenotype against infection by both hemoparasites and ticks. Moreover, the animal age may be an important factor related to resistance against these pathogens. The data obtained shed more light on the resistance to hemoparasites studied.

ID SENSITIVE DETECTION; DUPLEX PCR; INFECTIONS
AB Tiypanosoma evansi (T. evansi) is the most widely spread pathogenic trypanosome in the world. The control of trypanosomiasis depends on accurate diagnosis and effective treatment. Focusing on the presence of T. evansi in Asia, we developed a detection assay based on tracing phosphate ions (Pi) generated during LAMP targeting the variant surface glycoprotein (VSG) gene of Rode Trypanozoon antigenic type 1.2 (RoTat 1.2 VSG). The diagnostic potential as well as the use of the assay as a test-of-cure method after berenil treatment, was assessed in mice at different time points of infection. In addition, 67 buffalo blood collected from Tongling county, Anhui province, as well as 42 cattle sera from the Shanghai area, were used to evaluate the diagnostic validity of the test. The detection limit of the novel LAMP assay was determined to be as low as 1 fg of T. evansi DNA, while the reaction time for the test was only 30 min. Hence it outperforms both microscopy and PCR. In the test-of-cure assessment, successful berenil mediated cure could be confirmed within 48 h after treatment. This offers a tremendous advantage over conventional antibody-based diagnostic tools in which successful cure only can be confirmed after months. In the cattle and buffalo screening, the LAMP was able to detect a false-negative determined sample, wrongly classified in a conventional microscopy and PCR screening. Finally, no cross-reactivity was observed with other zoonotic parasites, such as T. evansi type B, T. congolense, T. brucei, Schistosoma japonicum, Plasmodium falciparum, Leishmania donovani, Toxoplasma gondii and Angiostrongylus cantonensis. We conclude that the novel LAMP assay is sensitive, specific and convenient for field use, particularly in areas where infection incidence has become extremely low. The LAMP assay could be used as a tool for trypanosomiasis control and elimination strategies in areas where T. evansi Type A infections are causing a threat to livestock fanning.

AB No licensed vaccine is currently available for prevention of Fasciola hepatica infections. However, considering the alarming increase in drug resistance, there is an urgent need for a safe and fully effective vaccine against fasciolosis. Here, we tested if cathepsins L (FhCL3-1, FhCL3-2) and B (FhCB3) secreted by juvenile liver flukes are viable vaccine targets when delivered alone or in combination in a rat model. Since control over the early immune response is crucial for parasite's establishment in its host, it was hypothesised that targeting fluke juvenile stages may prove beneficial. Moreover, it was assumed that selected antigens will act in a cumulative manner to interfere with liver fluke migration and thereby will reduce F. hepatica infection. Recombinant FhCL3-1 and FhCL3-2 delivered alone reduced liver fluke burdens by 47 % and 63 %, respectively. A trivalent vaccine containing rFhCL3-1/CL3-2/CB3 did not increase the protective vaccine efficacy compared to the rFhCL3-2 vaccinated group (53 %), although, reductions in liver fluke wet weight (statistically significant) and liver damage score were most pronounced. Further, the highest IgGi and IgG2a levels were seen in rFhCL3-2 vaccinated rats, the group for which the highest reduction in worm burden was demonstrated. Moreover, IgG1 and IgG2a levels in vaccinated rats were significantly elevated compared to those reported for control groups up to 4 week post-infection. While the mechanism of protection remains unknown, it appears that it depends on vaccine induced antibodies directed against cathepsins. The obtained results imply that F. hepatica juvenile-specific cathepsins are promising vaccine candidates that induce responses that successfully target early migratory liver fluke stages. Now, the challenge is to evaluate these juvenile-specific cathepsins for use in livestock.

AB Hepatic fibropoiesis in canine visceral leishmaniasis (CVL) were evaluated by histological (morphometrical collagen deposition) and immunohistochemical assays characterizing alpha-actin (alpha-SMA), vimentin, calprotectin (L1 antigen), and TGF-beta in 46 naturally infected dogs with Leishmania infantum treated with liposome-encapsulated meglumine antimoniate and allopurinol separately and in combination. Six treatment groups were defined: meglumine antimoniate encapsulated in nanometric liposomes (LMA), allopurinol (ALLOP); liposome-encapsulated meglumine antomoniate combined with allopurinol (LMA + ALLOP); empty liposomes (LEMP); empty liposomes combined with allopurinol (LEMP + ALLOP) and saline. Relative liver weight was lower in LMA, LMA + ALLOP, and ALLOP groups compared to the LEMP control. Significantly lower granulomatous chronic inflammatory reaction was seen in the ALLOP group compared to a control group. Calprotectin was lowest in liver of those dogs showing lower numbers of intralobular hepatic granulomas. Collagen deposits were significantly higher in LMA compared to ALLOP, LEMP + ALLOP, and Saline groups. LMA + ALLOP group collagen deposition was higher than dogs treated only with allopurinol. Immunohistochemical analysis showed significant higher alpha-SMA in hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), hepatic perisinusoidal cells, in control groups than LMA + ALLOP and LEMP + ALLOP. Alpha-actin and Vimentin positive cells were diffusely distributed throughout the liver parenchyma in the hepatic lobule, mainly in HSCs. Vimentin expression was significantly higher in the saline group than in the ALLOP group. Our data suggest that allopurinol inhibits HSC and results in lower collagen deposits in liver during CVL progression, as supported by the significantly lower expression of TGF-beta in the ALLOP group compared to other groups. Results demonstrated that treatment with allopurinol inhibited chronic granulomatous inflammatory reaction and hepatic fibrosis in CVL.

AB Rhipicephalus microplus, the major cattle tick species of India is prevalent all over the country and causes huge economic loss directly or indirectly to the dairy industries. Chemical acaricides are playing an important role in managing tick infestations on livestock for many years and consequently, resistance to commonly used organophosphate (OP) and synthetic pyrethroid (SP) compounds has been reported. Subsequently, ivermectin (IVM) has been emerged as an alternative to manage OP and SP resistant ticks. However, with the increase of use during the last 5-8 years, there is a possibility of development of resistance and thus there is an urgent need to develop a robust resistance monitoring tool to safeguard the drug. Lethal concentrations for 50 and 95% mortality of treated ticks were determined to work out discriminating concentration (DC) in order to diagnose resistance in the field situation. The DC (2 x LC95) was determined as 93.54 ppm using an established reference susceptible IVRI-1 line of R. microplus adopting adult immersion test. For validation of DC, the resistance status was checked in seven tick isolates of R. microplus collected from northern and eastern regions of India. The RR50 and RR95 values of the field isolates against ivermectin were determined and were in the range of 1.56-8.25 and 1.93-27.58, respectively. All the collected isolates were found to have higher lethal concentration and resistance ratio in comparison to reference susceptible IVRI-1 tick line (LC50 = 21.68, LC95 = 46.77 ppm, RR = 1.0). Amongst the field isolates, the isolate collected from Fatehgarh Sahib district (FTG) of Punjab state showed highest RR50 of 8.25 indicating high level of resistance to IVM. The generated DC will be used for IVM resistance characterization of ticks infesting cattle in different parts of the country.

AB Polycystic echinococcosis (PE) is caused by Echinococcus vogeli metacestodes (larval stage) in Neotropical countries. E. vogeli is trophically-transmitted between predators bush dogs (Speothos venaticus) and prey pacas (Cuniculus paca). In Brazil, reported PE cases are restricted to the Amazon biome. In this study, metacestodes from a paca hunted in Mato Grosso do Sul state (Cerrado biome) were identified morphological and histopathological techniques and further confirmed by molecular testing (sequencing of cytochrome C oxidase subunit I (cox1) gene) for the first time. Images of the whole liver showed superficial bubble-like hepatic masses. The parasitological analysis revealed large hooks (41.3 +/- 1.2 mu m length/12.8 +/- 0.8 mu m width) and small hooks (33.0 +/- 1.5 mu m length/11.1 +/- 1.2 mu m width), consistent with E. vogeli. Microscopically, the liver showed protoscoleces, a thick laminated layer, fibrosis, and inflammatory infiltrate in the adventitial layer. The DNA sequencing confirmed E. vogeli with 99% homology with sequences deposited in the GenBank. In addition, this finding greatly extends the geographic range of animal polycystic echinococcosis into the Cerrado. It is likely to occur in new biomes, where bush dogs and pacas share a given area in a trophic relationship.

AB The widespread occurrence of anthelmintic resistance in equine parasites across the world has led to recommendations of fecal egg count-based parasite programs to reduce treatment intensity and thereby delay further development of resistance as much as possible. The most recent study describing equine parasite control in the United States was conducted 20 years ago, and little is known about current strategies employed. This study was part of the National Animal Health Monitoring Systems (NAHMS) Equine 2015 Study, and aimed to describe equine parasite control strategies in the U.S. and evaluate to which extent respondents were in compliance with current guidelines. The study was carried out in 28 states, representing 70.9% of all equine operations with at least five equids present. Two questionnaires were administered, either by mail or delivered in person by veterinary medical officers. Participants provided specific details of their operation and were asked questions about strategies for anthelmintic therapy and diagnostic testing. A total of 380 operations provided data regarding their parasite control practices. Most respondents dewormed 2-3 times a year with ivermectin being the most commonly used anthelmintic. About 22% of respondents used fecal egg counts (FEC) in some form, with less than 10% using them on a regular basis. Less than 5% made use of fecal egg count reduction tests (FECRT). These results suggest little change since the last nationwide survey was conducted in 1998, as the majority of respondents did not report using FECs. This is in stark contrast to recent European surveys, where 50-60% of respondents were using FECs routinely. However, the anthelmintic treatment intensity appears to have been lowered compared to 1998. Taken together, these results suggest a continuing need for education and outreach regarding sustainable parasite control.

AB Infections with helminth parasites can negatively affect performance of dairy cows. Knowledge on infection intensity, spatial distributions and risk factors are key to develop targeted treatment strategies. Canada and most EU countries have conducted large investigations, but respective data for Switzerland were missing. We now performed a bulk tank milk serosurvey for Ostertagia ostertagi, Fasciola hepatica, and Dictyocaulus viviparus on a total of 1036 voluntarily participating dairy herds that were sampled at confinement periods, i.e. in winter 2014/15 or 2015/16, respectively. All samples were analyzed with commercial ELISAs for antibodies (AB) against . ostertagi and F. hepatica, and those of the first sampling period additionally with an in-house ELISA for AB against D. viviparus. Testing for the latter parasite was not done in the second year of the study, as the sampling period might have missed infections due to the short lived nature of specific antibodies. The possible influence of geographic, climatic, and farm management variables on AB levels were assessed for each parasite using scanning cluster and multiple regression analysis.
   Overall seroprevalence for O. ostertagi was 95.5% (95% C.I.: 94.0-96.6), with a mean optical density ratio (ODR) of 0.83, for F. hepatica 41.3% (95% C.I.: 38.3-44.4), and for D. viviparus 2.9% (95% C.I.: 1.6-4.7). There were no significant differences between the two sampling periods. For all parasites, significant geographic clusters of higher AB levels could be established. Furthermore, AB levels against all three parasites were positively correlated with each other, indicating either cross-reactions or co-infections. For O. ostertagi, herd size and percentage of pasture in the ration were positively correlated with AB levels. For F. hepatica, altitude above sea level (a.s.1.) positively, and milk production per cow and year was negatively correlated with AB levels.
   This work provides baseline data for further studies performing in-depth risk factor analysis and investigating management as well as targeted treatment options to control the parasites.

AB Immunological and performance characteristics were explored in Romney sheep from lines selected for either resistance or resilience to parasite infection. At a mean 78 days-of-age, twin lambs from a line selected for resistance (RT) and lambs from a line selected for resilience (RL) were infected with the intestinal nematode Trichostrongylus colubriformis for 100 days (I) while their twin remained as an uninfected control (C). Compared with RL, RT animals had lower levels of circulating CD4(+) T-cells (P = 0.003) but a greater proportion of these were activated (CD4(+)CD25(+)) in response to infection (P = 0.007). Differences between the lines in humoral immune responses to nematode infection varied with higher levels of T. colubriformis specific immunoglobulin (Ig) E in RT-I than RL-I (P = 0.002) but similar levels of both IgG (P = 0.926) and IgA (P = 0.321) responses. Temporal differences in the immune response also existed between the lines with RT-I animals displaying an earlier peak and more rapid reduction in FEC and an earlier peak in T. colubriformis specific IgA. In addition, compared with their RT-C and RL-C counterparts, infection caused a 22% reduction in feed intake from day 56 (P = 0.001) with total feed intake reduced by 15% and 9% for RT-I and RL-I, respectively. Cumulative live weight gain was greatest for RI. animals (P = 0.026) and relative to RT-C and RL-C was reduced by 5.8 kg and 4.9 kg for RT-I and RL-I, respectively. Overall, the selection lines appear to have differences in immunological characteristics that are both dependent on, and independent of parasite infection. Further, the difference in growth in the uninfected animals coupled with the similar cost of infection suggests the lower liveweight gain of RT-I compared with RL-I may be due to inherent differences between the lines in their growth potential, rather than a greater cost of infection in animals selected for resistance.

AB The FLOTAC' technique represents a highly sensitive method for the isolation of oocysts, eggs, and larvae of parasites in faeces. This assay could be used for detecting free-living stages of nematodes in the pasture but no attempt has been assessed so far. Therefore, the performance of FLOTAC (R) technique for isolating infective larvae of nematodes in the environment was investigated and compared with the spontaneous sedimentation (SST) and centrifugal sedimentation (CST) techniques. The study was conducted in a horse farm located in northeastern Brazil, where the occurrence of strongyle larvae had been previously reported. Pasture samplings were collected monthly from January to May 2016 in a 376 m(2) crop area harvested with the Guinea grass Panicum cultivar Massai. The recovery of third-stage larvae (L3) was performed using the FLOTAC (R), SST and CST techniques. Values of Cohen's kappa coefficient, sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, and accuracy of each technique were assessed. Although strongyle larvae were evenly detected, with the FLOTAC' technique yielded the highest number of positive samples (i.e., 41%, 41/100, p < .0001). The main parasites isolated belonged to the Cyathostominae and Strongylinae subfamilies. Based on these results, the FLOTAC (R) technique should be considered as practical and safe method for the isolation of nematode larvae in the pasture, thus opening a new potential use for this tool in the field.

AB Canine spirocercosis is caused by the nematode Spirocerca lupi. Migration results in oesophageal fibro-inflammatory nodules that may undergo neoplastic transformation. No studies have assessed pre- or post-surgical prognostic indicators in dogs that undergo intervention for S. lupi induced oesophageal neoplasia.
   This observational, multi-center study aimed to assess the outcome of dogs with Spirocerca induced sarcoma undergoing endoscopic-guided ablation (n = 12) or surgery (n = 18), and identify prognostic indicators. Parameters evaluated included: age, weight, gender, presenting complaints, duration of clinical signs, complete blood count, serum biochemistry, neoplasia size, placement of percutaneous endoscopically-placed gastrostomy tube, histopathological mitotic indices, days to discharge and chemotherapy administration.
   Kaplan-Meier survival curves showed no difference in survival between ablation and surgery {(median: 73.5 days (range: 0-1511) vs. 108 days (range: 0-1550), respectively (p = 0.982)}. Reduced survival was documented in patients presenting with weight loss (P = 0.027), hypochromasia (MCHC < 33 g/dL, P = 0.023) or leucocytosis (> 15 x 10(9)/L, P = 0.017) with a hazard ratio of 2.51 (CI95% = 1.071-6.018, P = 0.034), 2.71 (CI95% = 1.10-6.65, P = 0.03) and 4.39 (CI95%: 1.21-15.97, P = 0.025) respectively. In the dogs surviving more than 21 days, Ht < 36% and leucocytosis > 15.0 x 10(9)/L at presentation were associated with reduced survival (p = 0.016, p = 0.021 respectively) and hazard ratio of 3.29 (CI95% = 1.18-9.2, P = 0.023) and 3.81 (CI95% = 1.15-12.55, P = 0.028) respectively. Intra-intervention-group survival analysis identified increased survival time in dogs receiving chemotherapy, but only within the surgical group (P = 0.02). The hospitalisation time of dogs undergoing ablation (median: 0 days, range: 0-4) was significantly shorter than dogs undergoing surgery (9 days, 1-21) (P < 0.001).
   In this study, no clear benefit was identified for surgery, thus when ablation is technically possible it should be considered advantageous, as hospitalisation time is significantly shorter. Weight loss, hypochromasia and leucocytosis were identified as long-term prognostic indicators at presentation.

AB Autophagy is a lysosomal degradation pathway that acts as a cytoprotective mechanism causing treatment resistance in various cancer cells. Recent studies showed that hydroxychloroquine can inhibit the latter step of autophagy and therefore enhance the anti-glioma efficiency of ZD6474, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor. However, the nonselective distribution of ZD6474 in vivo and the low penetrating ability of hydroxychloroquine when crossing the blood-brain barrier restrict their clinical use in glioma therapy. Here we coencapsulated ZD6474 and hydroxychloroquine into R6dGR peptide-modified liposomes (R6dGR-Lip) which can specifically recognize both integrin alpha v beta 3 and neuropilin-1 receptors that are highly expressed on the endothelial cells and glioma cells. R6dGR significantly enhanced the brain targeting and overcame the blood-brain barrier. Our results confirmed that loading hydroxychloroquine into R6dGR-Lip blocked autophagic flux more efficiently than free hydroxychloroquine in glioma cells and significantly sensitized glioma cells to ZD6474-induced cell death in vitro and in vivo. The coencapsulated R6dGR-modified liposomes (ZD6474/HCQ-R6dGR-Lip) prolonged the medium survival time of intracranial C6 glioma bearing mice by 1.2-fold compared with ZD6474-R6dGR-Lip, 1.5-fold compared with free ZD6474/HCQ, and 1.8-fold compared with free ZD6474, exhibiting a synergistic therapeutic effect. Therefore, ZD6474/HCQ-R6dGR-Lip is presented as a potential strategy which could be further used for efficient anti-glioma therapy.

AB A simple and rapid chromatographic measurement method for determining doxorubicin (DOX) encapsulation efficiency (EE) into PEGylated liposomes using nanoparticle exclusion chromatography (nPEC) was developed. In this work, Doxil (R) and two PEGylated liposomes spiked with DOX were employed as model liposomes, and unencapsulated DOX was measured by high performance liquid chromatography with diode-array detector using an N-vinylpyrrolidone modified nPEC column without any sample pretreatment. Only 5 mu L of an intact liposomal suspension and 3 min analysis time were required for the determination of the quantity of unencapsulated DOX. The method was validated in terms of linearity, accuracy, precision, and recovery in the range from 0.00-1.0 mg/mL (corresponding to 100-50% EE). Applicability of the method was confirmed using the measurement of time-dependent DOX loading% into the liposomes with the remote loading method using an ammonium sulfate gradient. Furthermore, it was found that the peak area of DOX-loaded liposomes in the chromatogram was proportional to DOX EE%. As this simple and rapid analytical method can measure the EE precisely, it is expected that this method will be applicable to the in-process control of liposome preparation manufacturing and the quality control of the liposome drug products.

AB Although anti-angiogenic therapy is predicted to be an effective therapy for treating cancer, selectively targeting tumor endothelial cells (TECs), and not normal endothelial cells, remains a major obstacle. Modifying a drug carrier with a targeting ligand is a popular strategy for developing an active-targeting type drug delivery system (DDS). We previously reported that a cyclo(Arg-Gly-Asp-D-Phe-Lys) (cRGD)-equipped liposome that contains encapsulated siRNA (RGD-MEND) achieved an efficient therapeutic outcome in a murine cancer model. To develop a more efficient TEC-targeting DDS, we examined the effect of the length of the polyethylene glycol (PEG) that is used as a peptide-linker on the cholesterol-scaffold, and liposomal composition on the efficiency of delivery of siRNA to cRGD receptor alpha(V)beta(3) integrin positive cells. An RGD-MEND modified with shorter linker/no-linker, PEG350 or no-PEG, showed a higher cellular uptake in vitro. However, a shorter or no-linker RGD-cholesterol-modified MEND showed no silencing effect despite its high, in vitro silencing efficiency. To examine the possibility that the cholesterol-scaffold ligand was removed from the surface of the RGD-MEND by interactions with serum proteins, the RGD-MEND was incubated in the presence of a 50% serum solution. The cellular uptake of the cholesterol-scaffold ligand was drastically reduced by the incubation in serum. Increasing the cholesterol ratio in the lipid envelope and adding a helper lipid improved the in vivo knockdown efficiency, probably due to an enhanced ligand retention, even in in vivo conditions. The findings reported herein suggest that the lipid composition and the ligand scaffold of the MEND are major factors in successfully developing an efficient active-targeting DDS.

AB TB-Superbugs have emerged as one of the most challenging global health threat due to the decrease in effectiveness of conventional antibiotics. Meanwhile, Host defense peptides (HDP) have evolved as an alternative to classical therapeutics with lesser susceptibility of resistance. We describe the potential of nano-encapsulated synthetic Magainin-I analog peptide (MIAP) as Host Directed Therapy against TB. Micron-sized inhalable platform "Porous Nanoparticle Aggregates Particles (PNAP)" with nano-scale physiognomies were developed to improve the delivery of MIAP-peptide to the lungs and enhance its stability. This particle engineering enabled more control over aerodynamic characteristics and bioactive release. Antimicrobial and mechanistic studies were carried out against virulent H37Rv TB bacteria. These MIAP-PNAP nano-assemblies demonstrated dose and time dependent antibacterial action against virulent M.tb for at least 96 h, with up to similar to 3.03-log CFU reduction in numbers of viable bacteria compared to untreated group. These MIAP-PNAP at concentration of 50 mu M and above showed significant antibacterial effects on M.tb after 48-96 h of incubation. Mechanistically, MIAP nano-formulation enhanced host defense mechanism by averting bacteria-induced inhibition of phagosomal-lysosome fusion (Lysostracker) and apoptosis (Annexin-FITC) as shown by confocal microscopy and flow-cytometry. Encapsulated MIAP may serve for adjunctive host-directed TB therapy which may also synergizes the efficacy of standard anti-TB drugs.

AB There is an impetus to provide appropriate sustained release oral delivery vehicles to protect biofunctional peptide loads from gastric degradation in vivo. This study describes the generation of a high load capacity pellet formulation for sustained release of a freely water-soluble dairy-derived hydrolysate, FHI-2571. The activity of this novel peptidic ghrelin receptor agonist is reported using in vitro calcium mobilization assays. Conventional extrusion spheronization was then used to prepare peptide-loaded pellets which were subsequently coated with ethylcellulose (EC) film coats using a fluid bed coating system in bottom spray (Wurster) mode. Aqueous-based EC coating dispersions produced mechanically brittle coats which fractured due to osmotic pressure build-up within pellets in simulated media. In contrast, an ethanolic-based EC coating solution provided robust, near zero-order release in both USP Type 1 and Type 4 dissolution studies. Interestingly, the functionality of aqueous-based EC film coats was restored by first layering pellets with a methacrylic acid copolymer (MA) subcoat, thereby hindering pellet core swelling in acidic media. Broadband Acoustic Resonance Dissolution Spectroscopy (BARDS) was utilised as a complementary technique to confirm the results seen in USP dissolution studies. Retention of activity of the ghrelinergic peptide hydrolysate in the final encapsulated product was confirmed as being greater than 80%. The described pellet formulation is amenable to oral dosing in small animal studies in order to assess in vivo efficacy of the whey-derived ghrelinergic hydrolysate. In more general terms, it is also suitable as a delivery vehicle for peptide-based bioactives to special population groups e.g paediatric and geriatric.

AB The aim of this study was to develop nanoparticle loaded hydrogel based contact lenses that could be used for ocular drug delivery. Two potential contact lens platforms for controlled ophthalmic drug delivery were developed by incorporating chitosan-poly (acrylic acid) nanoparticles into polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) hydrogels and in-situ gelled nanoparticles and cellulose nanocrystals (CNC) in PVA lenses. The nanoparticles were shown to disintegrate in a physiological 0.2 mM concentration of lysozyme resulting from the hydrolysis of the chitosan chains by lysozyme. An extended release over a 28-h period was demonstrated once the nanoparticles had been integrated into the composite lenses, with nanoparticle-CNC PVA lenses showing even greater potential for extended release. The platform shows great promise in developing enzyme-triggered ocular drug delivery systems.
