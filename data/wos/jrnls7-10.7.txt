AB A synergetic effect of rare earth (Yb) ion doping and ammoniation on the enhancements of both ultraviolet and visible photocatalytic activities of TiO2 is reported. It is found that ammoniation can dope both nitrogen and hydrogen ions for bandgap narrowing and dangling bond passivation, respectively. Meanwhile, the Yb-doping results in the formation of defective bands that are close to the conduction band minimum, and have strong electron capture abilities to prevent recombination of photogenerated electrons and holes. The synergism of the two effects of Yb doping and ammoniation leads to a significant enhancement of both ultraviolet and visible photocatalysis. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB We investigated the atomic and electronic properties of (100) stacking fault (SF) in undoped and La-doped BaSnO3 by first-principles calculations. It was found that 1/2[111] (100) SF is energetically favorable when Ba atoms occupy the interface while 1/2 (100) [101] SF becomes the most stable when the SF interface is occupied by Sn atoms. SF influences the distribution of La dopant and the electric properties of the system. In the presence of SF, electronic states near the Fermi level decrease and the bandgap expands by about 0.6 eV. Our results suggest that SF is one of the possible origins for the performance degradation. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this paper, we report about the preparation of novel nanocomposite films based on graphene and poly (3,4 ethylenedioxythiophene)-poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS). It has been observed that the prepared nanocomposite material shows excellent electrical conductivity of 60 S/cm and highly transparent (>90%) in the visible region. The resistivity of graphene and PEDOT: PSS nanocomposite films decreases as temperature increases, which is a characteristic behavior of semiconductors. The conductivity of nanocomposite film is enhanced by two orders of magnitude as compared to pristine PEDOT:PSS film. Au/graphene-PEDOT: PSS nanocomposite/n-Si/In-Ga diodes are fabricated and it exhibited rectifying behavior. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID APPROXIMATION
AB Study of the adsorption properties of graphene has great significance for expanding its application. So far, few studies have analyzed the effects of adatoms on opposite sides of graphene. We use density functional theory to report the effects of chlorine and alkali metal adatoms on the other side of graphene. Although there is an obvious charge transfer between the adatom and graphene, the interaction between the adatoms is shielded by the large pi bonds of graphene and therefore the effects of the adatom on the other side of graphene are very weak.

AB The energy optimized structure of sodium 1,4-dihydroxy-9,10-anthraquinone-2-sulphonate (QS) was determined using computational methods. The interaction of it with cationic surfactant cetyltrimethylammonium bromide was investigated in aqueous solution at pH 7.4. The aspect of the affinity of such molecule to cationic surfactant micelle is important in determining its biological action. The binding constant, partition coefficient and the stoichiometry were determined for molecule-CTAB interaction. The study showed that the hydrophobic interaction plays a major role in binding of QS to CTAB micelles. Gibbs free energy for the binding and distribution of QS between the bulk aqueous medium and surfactant micelles were calculated. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The microscopic effect of electronic excitations on the transformation of few-layer graphene into sp(3)-bonded carbon nanofilm is examined through static and real-time propagation time-dependent density-functional theory. Statically, the presence of holes in high-lying valence bands is shown to reduce the energy barrier substantially. Dynamics of excited state electrons combined with Ehrenfest atomic motions reveals that non-thermal fast transformation from sp(2) to sp(3) can happen within a few hundreds femtoseconds. We suggest that once the efficient path of sp(3) carbon surface passivation is provided, the excitation from pi to pi* bands of few-layer graphenes can be utilized to achieve the transformation into nanoscale sp(3)-bonded carbon film without heating process.

AB Using lattice gas Monte Carlo simulations, we studied the dewetting transition of water confined between a spherical tip and a plate, which is relevant to atomic force microscopy measurements conducted in water. The dewetting transition was investigated by varying the tip-plate distance, tip size, and the pressure of water. With introduction of an atomic scale roughness (1 < nm) in the tip and the plate, the dewetting transition significantly increased in range and yielded an enhanced hydrophobic force between the tip and the plate. This finding is in agreement with the experimental results previously reported by Singh et al. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Effective fragment potential version 2 - molecular dynamics (EFP2-MD) simulations, where the EFP2 is a polarizable force field based on ab initio electronic structure calculations were applied to water-methanol binary mixture. Comparing EFP2s defined with (aug-)cc-pVXZ (X = D, T) basis sets, it was found that large sets are necessary to generate sufficiently accurate EFP2 for predicting mixture properties. It was shown that EFP2-MD could predict the excess molar volume. Since the computational cost of EFP2-MD are far less than ab initio MD, the results presented herein demonstrate that EFP2-MD is promising for predicting physicochemical properties of novel mixed solvents.

AB The Li+-ligand binding energies are computed for seven ligands and their perfluoro analogs using Density Functional Theory. The bonding is mostly electrostatic in origin. Thus the size of the binding energy tends to correlate with the ligand dipole moment, however, the charge-induced dipole contribution can be sufficiently large to affect the dipole-binding energy correlation. The perfluoro species are significantly less strongly bound than their parents, because the electron withdrawing power of the fluorine reduces the ligand dipole moment. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB A full-dimensional electronic ground state potential energy surface for the hydrogen abstraction reaction F + HCl -> HF + Cl is developed by using the permutation invariant polynomial neural network approach based on 6509 points computed at the level of CCSD(T)-F12a/AVTZ. Spin-orbit correction is also taken into account at the complete active space self-consistent field level. Theoretical thermal rate coefficients determined by the ring polymer molecular dynamics (RPMD) approach agree well with experiment, validating the accuracy of the PES. Kinetic isotope effect is also investigated. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Three two-dimensional (2D) single layer boron nitride sheets have been predicted based on the first-principles calculations. These 2D boron nitride sheets are comprised of equivalent boron atoms and nitride atoms with sp(2) and sp bond hybridization. The geometry optimization reflects that they all possess stable planar crystal structures with the space group P (6) over bar 2m (D-3h(3)) symmetry. The charge density distribution manifests that the B-N bonds in these boron nitride sheets are covalent in nature but with ionic characteristics. The tunable band gaps indicate their potential applications in nanoscale electronic and optoelectronic devices by changing the length of sp-bonded B-N linkages. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB Properties of the MAu and MOH (M = Tl and element 113, Nh) molecules were calculated using the 2c-DFT method. The obtained data are needed for evaluation of reactivity of Nh studied by gas-phase chromatography experiments. Results show that Nh should be less reactive (or more volatile) than Tl, both with respect to gold and the hydroxyl group. The reason for that are strong relativistic effects on the valence 7s and 7p electron shells. In difference to the atoms, NhOH may be less volatile than TlOH due to its larger both dipole moment and anisotropic polarizability. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Using the alternating-current electrochemical technique, a novel pi-complex [Cu-2(Alobtr)(2)(H2O)(2)] (CH3C6H4SO3)(2) (1) was obtained starting from copper(II) p-toluenesulfonate and the 1-allyloxybenzotriazole (Alobtr) ethanol solution. The structure 1 should be considered as the first known example of Cu-I(p-CH3C6H4SO3) pi-coordination compound. Alobtr molecule acts as a chelate pi, sigma-ligand (being attached to the Cu(I) by means of allylic C=C bond and the two triazole N atoms) and forms centrosymmetric [Cu-2(Alobtr)(2)(H2O)(2)](2+) dimers. Cationic fragments and pTsO anions are connected by means of (Ow)H center dot center dot center dot O hydrogen bonds into 1D chains. Laser stimulated third harmonic generation for fundamental wavelength 1540 nm is explored. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The present study demonstrated the binary and ternary complexes of Zaltoprofen (ZPF) with beta-CD and HP-beta-CD. The products were characterized using solubility, in vitro dissolution, and DSC studies. The mode of interaction of guest and host was revealed through H-1 NMR and FT-IR studies. A significant increase was noticed in the stability constant (K-c) and complexation efficiency (CE) of beta-CD and HP-beta-CD due to addition of L-Arg in ternary complexes. The ternary complexes showed greater increase in solubility and dissolution of ZPF than binary complexes. Thus, ternary system of ZPF could be an innovative approach for its solubility and dissolution enhancement. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The measured peak flux is a factor of one thousand larger than in a continuous beam. Comparison with continuous nozzle results show similar droplet sizes at low T < 6 K, indicating in both cases the droplets are created via the fragmentation of the fluid. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

The synthesized rGO/Ag nanohybrid is characterized by XRD, XPS, FTIR spectroscopy and HRTEM techniques. Cyclic voltammograms demonstrate that the rGO/Ag nanohybrid exhibits higher electrocatalytic activity in comparison to rGO sheets for methanol oxidation reaction (MOR). This enhancement is attributed to the synergetic effect produced by the presence of more active sites provided by Ag NPs anchored on a conducting network of large surface area rGO sheets.

AB In this study, Au was electrodeposited on a support of CaFeMg layered double hydroxide and then, its catalytic activity was investigated for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Field emission scanning electron microscopy images showed that a uniform porous film of aggregated nano-particles of the LDH has been decorated with Au nanodendrite-like structures (AuNDs@LDH). The results obtained from polarization curves, Tafel plots and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy showed that the AuNDs@LDH exhibits lower overpotential, higher current density, faster kinetics and enhanced stability for both of the OER and HER, in comparison with the single AuNPs and LDH catalysts.

AB The flexible strain sensors that integrate optical and electric signals are rather limited, although the flexible sensor community has witnessed increased progresses. Herein, we have fabricated stretchable polymer composites showing both mechanically modulated fluorescence and electric resistance by using polyester elastomer, zinc phthalocyanine (ZnPc) and silver nanowires (Ag NW) as basic components. Specifically, the strain variation in the range of 0-30% and 50-400% can be well correlated with the alternation of electric resistance and red fluorescence of flexible composites, respectively. The present work will open the way for the large-scale fabrication of multi-functional flexible strain sensors. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are an effective spacer to prevent the re-stacking of graphene layers. However, the aggregation of CNTs always reduces the specific surface area of resulting CNT/graphene composites. Meanwhile, different pores always have different contributions to the specific capacitance. In this study, CNT/graphene composites with different porous structures are synthesized by co-reduction of oxidized CNTs and graphene oxide with different mixing ratios. With an optimized CNT content of 20%, the CNT/graphene composite shows 206 F g (1) in 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate electrolyte. It is found that pores larger than twice the size of electrolyte ions can make greater contributions to the specific capacitance. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Hydrated metal ions such as Na+, Mg2+, and Cu2+ in addition to surface species like citrate, p-mercaptobenzoic acid (PMBA), and halide anions were identified by exploiting coupled localized surface plasmons of flocculated silver nanoparticles (AgNPs). Indeed, SERS spectra provided clear evidence for the formation of citrate complexes of Co2+ and Cu2+ as well as ion pairs of metal ions and PMBA(-) anions on AgNPs. For the first time, we have detected pronounced Raman bands from hydrated metal ions in flocculates of halide-covered AgNPs assigned to restricted rotation and translation at 600-200 cm(-1) and O-H stretching bands at 3500-3600 cm(-1). Interestingly, the peak frequencies of O-H stretching mode from hydrated metal ions are sensitive to metal and halide species, proving the observed water molecules are sandwiched between trapped metal ions and halide ions on adjacent AgNPs while forming a solvent shared ion pair.

AB We investigate an enhancement of the orientation of OCS molecules by irradiating them with a near IR (omega) ultrashort laser pulse for alignment followed by another ultrashort laser pulse for orientation, which is synthesized by a phase-locked coherent superposition of the near IR laser pulse and its second harmonic (2 omega). On the basis of the asymmetry in the ejection direction of S3+ fragment ions generated by the Coulomb explosion of multiply charged OCS, we show that the extent of the orientation of OCS is significantly enhanced when the delay between the alignment pulse and the orientation pulse is a quarter or three quarters of the rotational period. The recorded enhanced orientation was interpreted well by a numerical simulation of the temporal evolution of a rotational wave packet prepared by the alignment and orientation pulses.

AB Small angle neutron scattering study reveals that at pD approximate to 7.0, above the isoelectric point of the globular protein Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA), in the presence of different divalent ions (Mg2+, Ca2+, Sr2+ and Ba2+), the short-range attractive interaction remains nearly constant and the intermediate-range repulsive interaction decreases with increasing salt concentration up to a certain concentration value but after that remains unchanged. However, for the monovalent ion (Na+), repulsive interaction decreases gradually up to 1 M salt concentration. Dynamic light scattering study shows that for all ions, diffusion coefficient of BSA decreases with increasing salt concentration and then nearly saturates. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB We investigate the energetics of the antiparallel, hybrid and parallel type G-quadruplex structures of the human telomere DNA sequence. We find that both the conformational energy and solvation free energy of these structures are roughly inversely proportional to their radii of gyration. We rationalize this finding in terms of the dominance of the electrostatic contributions. We also show that the solvation free energy is more significant than the conformational energy in determining the G-quadruplex structures, which is in contrast to the canonical B-DNA structures. Our work will contribute to an understanding of the molecular mechanisms dictating various G-quadruplex topologies. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID NETWORKS; WOMEN; CARE
AB Objectives: To explore the ways in which medical abortion pills are obtained and used by university students in Chile in a clandestine context.
   Study design: Using a qualitative approach, we conducted in-depth interviews with 30 young women who had had a medical abortion between 2006 and 2016 while attending university. We recorded the details of their pathways to abortion and their experience of abortion, and how they used networks in the university to find the pills and learn how to use them. The interviews were analyzed using narrative content analysis.
   Results: The findings show that medical abortion did not take place completely outside the healthcare system for these students, who accessed ultrasound scans pre- and post-abortion and post-abortion care. However, even with help and support from contacts, partners and friends, the clandestine situation created uncertainty and fear, which dominated the whole process, from finding and purchasing the pills, to uncertainty about correct doses and whether the abortion was going as it should and was complete or not. There was a high perception that failure and complications might be occurring, which led many of them to seek post-abortion care. The process was very demanding, requiring information, time, privacy to have the abortion, support and resources, and the ability to deal with risk.
   Conclusions: Medical abortion allowed these young women to have safe abortions in terms of reduced risks to health and autonomy through self-management. However, clandestinity made them physically, socially and emotionally vulnerable and exposed them to the risk of normative, violent judgments during post-abortion care. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

   BARRIERS
AB Objective: Legal restrictions on abortion access impact the safety and timing of abortion. Women affected by these laws face bathers to safe care that often result in abortion being delayed. Second-trimester abortion affects vulnerable groups of women disproportionately and is often more difficult to access. In Argentina, where abortion is legally restricted except in cases of rape or threat to the health of the woman, the Socorristas en Red, a feminist network, offers a model of accompaniment wherein they provide information and support to women seeking second-trimester abortions. This qualitative analysis aimed to understand Socorristas' experiences supporting women who have second trimester medication abortion outside the formal health care system.
   Study design: We conducted 2 focus groups with 16 Socorristas in total to understand experiences accompanying women having second trimester medication abortion who were at 14-24 weeks' gestational age. We performed a thematic analysis of the data and present key themes in this article.
   Results: The Socorristas strived to ensure that women had the power of choice in every step of their abortion. These cases required more attention and logistical, legal and medical risks than first-trimester care. The Socorristas learned how to help women manage the possibility of these risks and were comfortable providing this support. They understood their work as activism through which they aim to destigmatize abortion and advocate against patriarchal systems denying the right to abortion.
   Conclusion: Socorrista groups have shown that they can provide supportive, women-centered accompaniment during second-trimester medication abortions outside the formal health care system in a setting where abortion access is legally restricted. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB Objective: To examine reasons for seeking abortion services outside the formal healthcare system in Great Britain, where abortion is legally available.
   Study design: We conducted a mixed-methods study among women resident in England, Scotland, and Wales who requested at-home medication abortion through online telemedicine initiative Women on Web (WoW) between November 22, 2016, and March 22, 2017. We examined the demographics and circumstances of all women requesting early medication abortion and conducted a content analysis of a sample of their anonymized emails to the service to explore their reasons for seeking help.
   Results: Over a 4-month period, 519 women contacted WoW seeking medication abortion. These women were diverse with respect to age, parity, and circumstance. One hundred eighty women reported 209 reasons for seeking abortion outside the formal healthcare setting. Among all reasons, 49% were access barriers, including long waiting times, distance to clinic, work or childcare commitments, lack of eligibility for free NHS services, and prior negative experiences of abortion care; 30% were privacy concerns, including lack of confidentiality of services, perceived or experienced stigma, and preferring the privacy and comfort of using pills at home; and 18% were controlling circumstances, including partner violence and partner/family control.
   Conclusion: Despite the presence of abortion services in Great Britain, a diverse group of women still experiences logistical and personal barriers to accessing care through the formal healthcare system, or prefer the privacy of conducting their abortions in their own homes.

AB Polyriboinosinic-polyribocytidylic acid (polyl:C) is a viral dsRNA analoguethat promotes wounds healing, accelerates re-epithelialization, granulation and neovascularization, and induces pro-inflammatory cytokine release. Little is known about polyl:C mediated induction of inflammatory mediators in human dermal fibroblast (HDFs), which form the primary scaffold for epithelial cells covering the wound. Here, we found that polyl:C enhances IL-6 and IL-8 mRNA expression and induces of IL-6 and IL-8 production in a concentration-dependent and time-dependent manner in HDFs. PolyI:C treatment rapidly increased phosphorylation level of both STAT3 and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK). Moreover, pretreatment with AG490, a Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor, inhibited polyl:C-induced STAT3 phosphorylation and subsequent IL-6 and IL-8 release. Conversely, pretreatment with SB203580, a selective inhibitor of p38 MAPK, blocked p38 MAPK phosphorylation and IL-6 and IL-8 expression. In conclusion, polyl:C induces IL-6 and IL-8 production in HDFs via the JAK/STAT3 and p38 MAPK signaling pathways.

   CLEARANCE
AB Rhodococcus equi is a common cause of pneumonia in foals and an opportunistic pathogen in immunosuppressed people. The ability of R. equi to survive and replicate in macrophages is the basis of its pathogenicity. Limited knowledge about the role of cytokines in host defense against R. equi comes from studies in mice and the role of cytokines in intracellular survival of R. equi in equine macrophages is unknown. The objectives of this study were to determine the effect of priming with interferon (IFN)-gamma, interleukin (IL)-1 beta, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, or tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha at various concentrations on intracellular survival of virulent R. equi in equine monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM), and to determine the effects of various combinations of the same cytokines on intracellular survival of R. equi. MDM from 10 adult horses were primed with recombinant equine cytokines at doubling concentrations ranging from 25 to 200 ng/mL prior to infection with virulent R. equi. Priming with IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha, or IL-6 significantly decreased intracellular replication of R. equi compared to unprimed monolayers. In contrast, priming with IL-10 or IL-1 beta significantly increased intracellular replication of R. equi. Pairwise combinations of the cytokines listed above did not results in synergism or antagonism. This study demonstrated that IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha, or IL-6 improved equine MDM function against R. equi whereas IL-1 beta or IL-10 were detrimental.

AB Despite the increasing evidence for the importance of immunity in breast cancer, the contradictory role of inflammation has not been thoroughly researched. In this study, we investigate the prognostic value of intratumoral inflammation as evaluated by cytokine mRNA levels.
   Intratumoral mRNA was measured for ILI beta, IL6, IL8, IL10 and IL17A, using Taqman quantitative PCR. By the AUC criteria, none of the cytokines associated with metastasis outcome over the entire follow-up period. However, separation of the follow-up period has revealed a time-dependent and robust prognostic association of IL beta. It discriminated between patients with and without metastasis relapse by AUCs of 0.21 and 0.82 during the early and late follow-up of 0-7 and 7-14 years, respectively. Interestingly, the prognostic effect by IL1 beta shifted during follow-up from good prognosis in the first seven years to bad prognosis thereafter. By the less stringent criteria of Cox regression analysis, other cytokines also significantly associated positively or negatively with metastasis outcome. IL17A associated with good prognosis in the first 7 years of follow up while IL6 associated with poor and IL10 with good prognosis from 7 to 14 years.
   The revealed time-dependent prognostic effects of cytokine mRNA levels are intriguing and may reflect valuable biological information which should be considered in breast cancer immunotherapy research.

AB Our aim was to explore the putative beneficial effects of low-to-moderate intensity exercise training program in patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). This study evaluated the changes in blood oxidative stress status, inflammatory biomarkers and IBS severity symptoms following 24 weeks of moderate aerobic exercise in sedentary IBS patients. A total of 109 female volunteers (aged 18-41 yrs) who fulfilled Rome III criteria for the diagnosis of IBS were screened and 60 were randomized to exercise (EX, n= 30) and non-exercise (NON-EX, n = 30) groups. Exercise intervention favorably attenuated inflammation as indicated by plasma cytokines (IL-1 beta, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10 and TNF-alpha), adenosine deaminase, oxidative stress (XO, MDA and NO) and enhanced antioxidants (SOD, CAT and GSH-Px) (P <.05), and these alterations correlate with promising improvements in IBS symptoms (P <.05). Taken together, low-to-moderate intensity exercise training program attenuates symptoms in IBS. Symptom improvement was associated with a reversal of the ratio of anti- to pro-inflammatory cytokines as well as facilitating blood redox homeostasis, suggesting an immune- and redox modulating function for exercise training.

AB Interleukin (IL)-7 is a potent proliferation, activation, and survival cytokine for CD8(+) T cells to improve viral and tumor specific CD8(+) T cell responses. However, the role of IL-7 in regulation of dysfunctional hepatitis C virus (HCV)-specific CD8(+) T cells was not fully elucidated. Thus, a total of 53 patients with chronic hepatitis C and 24 healthy individuals were enrolled in the current study. Serum IL-7 and its receptor a chain CD127 expression was measured. The modulatory function of IL-7 to CD8(+) T cells was investigated in both direct and indirect contact co-culture with HCVcc-infected Huh7.5 cells. Both serum IL-7 and CD127 expression on CD8(+) T cells was significantly reduced in chronic HCV-infected patients, which was negatively correlated with HCV RNA. Stimulation of IL-7 promoted both cytotoxicity and cytokines (interferon-gamma, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and IL-2) production of CD8(+) T cells from patients with chronic hepatitis C. Moreover, IL-7 increased proliferation of CD8(+) T cells, while downregulated a critical repressor of cytokine signaling, suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS3). The IL-7-mediated enhancement effects to CD8(+) T cells were dependent on IL-6 production. The current data suggested that IL-7 induced both cytolytic and noncytolytic functions of CD8(+) T cells probably via repression of SOCS3. IL-7 might be considered as one of the therapeutic candidates for treatment of chronic HCV infection.

AB Red blood cells are widely accepted to be inert carriers of oxygen and haemoglobin, but there is growing evidence that they play a much more critical role in immune function. Macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) is a key cytokine in disease with additional oxido-reductase activity, which aids in managing oxidative stress. Although two studies have reported the presence of MIF in red blood cells, no study has quantified the levels of this protein. In this study, freshly isolated plasma, platelets, leukocytes, and red blood cells from healthy individuals were collected and the concentration of MIF was determined using an enzyme linked immunosorbent assay. This analysis demonstrated that MIF in red blood cells was present at 25 mu g per millilitre of whole blood, which is greater than 99% of the total MIF and 1000-fold higher concentration than plasma. This result was supported by electrophoresis and Western blot analysis, which identified MIF in its monomer structural form following sample processing. Furthermore, by assessing the level of tautomerase activity in red blood cell fractions in the presence of a MIF inhibitor, it was determined that the red blood cell-derived MIF was also functionally active. Together, these findings have implications on the effect of haemolysis during sample preparation and provide some clue into the inflammatory processes that occur following haemolysis in vivo. These results support the hypothesis that red blood cells are a major reservoir of this inflammatory protein and may play a role in inflammation.

A new kind of chemokines, chemokine like factor 1 (CKLF1), which is cloned through suppression subtractive hybridisation (SSH) technology is expressed widely in human body, especially in the lung and peripheral blood leukocytes. CKLF1 has a broad spectrum of chemotaxic activity for many cells, such as lymphocytes, macrophages, bone marrow cells, nerve cells and so on. In addition, CKLF1 also stimulates the regeneration of skeletal muscle cells in vivo. Collecting data derived from our and other laboratories show that CKLF1 has an important relationship with allergic diseases, autoimmune diseases, tumors, cardio-cerebrovascular diseases and so on. Therefore, there be an important theoretical purport and applied value to make a summary of pharmacological progress of CKLF1.

AB Background and aims: The immune response to acute cerebral ischemia plays an important role in the pathophysiology of stroke and could be a therapeutic target. Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) is a master regulator of innate immunity. The aim of our study was to determine the association between selected cytokine release after TLR4 activation in blood cells and the outcome after ischemic stroke.
   Methods: We included 156 ischemic stroke patients (median age: 69; 40.4% female). Venous blood was collected at day 3 after the onset of stroke and stimulated ex vivo with lipopolysaccharide (LPS). The LPS-induced level of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha) was used as a proxy of the MyD88-dependent pathway, and interferon gamma-inducible protein 10 (IP-10) was used as a proxy of the MyD88-independent pathway. The functional outcome was assessed at 3 months after stroke onset.
   Results: TNF alpha (median: 2.2 vs. 3.5 pg/10(3) monocytes, p <.01) and IP-10 release (median: 0.3 vs. 0. 6 pg/10(3) monocytes, p <.01) was reduced in patients with a poor outcome. In a multivariate logistic regression analysis adjusted for age, stroke severity, and pneumonia, low TNF alpha release was associated with a poor outcome (OR: 4.23, 95%CI: 1.64-10.90, p =.03). Similarly, low IP-10 release was related to an unfavorable prognosis (adjusted OR: 3.42, 95%Cl: 1.49-8.21, p <.01).
   Conclusions: The reduced release of TNF alpha and IP-10 after ex vivo blood stimulation with endotoxin is independently associated with poor outcome after stroke. Our results suggest that the inhibition of both the MyD88-dependent pathway and MyD88-independent pathway of TLR4 signaling in blood cells correlates with an unfavorable prognosis in stroke patients.

AB Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a progressive and fatal disease, characterized by the absence of dystrophin, muscle degeneration and cardiorespiratory failure. Creatine kinase is the classic marker to screen for DMD. However, other markers are needed to follow disease progression and to evaluate the response to therapy over longer periods. In the present study, we aim to identify interleukins in the plasma of the mdx mice model of DMD that could serve as biomarkers to monitor dystrophy progression, at distinct stages of the disease (1, 3 and 8 months of age). We used deflazacort and omega-3 therapies to validate the biomarkers studied. Plasma levels of TNF-alpha and TGF-beta were increased in mdx mice in relation to control, at all times studied. Differences in IFN-gamma and IL-10 contents, comparing mdx x CTRL, were detected only at the early stage (1 month). IL-6 decreased at 3 and 8 months and IL-13 increased at 8 months in the mdx compared to control. Deflazacort and omega-3 reduced the plasma levels of the pro-inflammatory (TNF-alpha, INF-gamma, IL-6) and pro-fibrotic (IL-13 and TGF-beta) interleukins and increased the plasma levels of IL-10. It is suggested that TNF-alpha and TGF-beta in plasma would be the best markers to follow disease progression. IL-6, INF-gamma and IL-10 would be suitable markers to the earlier stages of dystrophy and IL-13 a suitable marker to the later stages of dystrophy.

AB Previously our lab has created a mouse ovarian xenograft model of copy number variation (CNV)-mediated G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) MAS-driven tumorigenesis, and RNA profiling identified a putative chemokine tumor-induced factor (Tif). Sequence analysis and chemotactic study suggested that Tif was likely to be a hamster homolog of human GRO gamma (CXCL3) [IJC 125 (2009): 1316-1327]. In the present study, we report the molecular and functional characterization of the Tif gene. Genomic study of CHO-Kl cells indicated that Tif gene consisted of 4 exons, characterized with an antisense B1 element which is embedded in the fourth exon. Two Tif transcripts were identified which shared identical sequences except that a string of 71-nt derived from the antisense B1 element was deficient in the shorter transcript. Of interests, B1-like RNA ladder was detected in xenografts. Functional studies showed that TIF induced chemotaxis and neovessel formation. Pharmacological studies suggested that TIF activated Gi-coupled CXCR2 and induced both calcium mobilization and ERK1/2 phosphorylation, and suppressed forskolin-stimulated cAMP accumulation. In addition, secreted matured TIF functioned as an autocrine factor and promoted anchorage-independent growth. Unexpectedly, TIF delayed the onset of tumor formation, possibly via suppressing proliferation of stromal fibroblasts. However, TIF did not exert any inhibitory effect on tumor growth. Potentially, TIF could be used for preventing cancer relapse.

AB Background: Nephrotic syndrome (NS) characterized by complex pathogenesis and clinical course with relapses; and needs novel breakthroughs for decades. Polymorphisms of cytokines genes including tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) may influence susceptibility to NS as well as different patients' steroid responses. In the current study, we demonstrated the potential roles of TNF-alpha promoter gene polymorphisms 1 238, 308, 8631 and haplotypes in susceptibility to childhood NS. Also, elucidating their possible influence on patients' steroid response and serum TNF-alpha level.
   Methods: This case-control study included 150 children suffering from NS and 150 healthy children. Polymerase chain reaction- restriction-fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) was performed to evaluate different TNFa gene polymorphism. TNF-alpha serum levels were assessed by ELISA.
   Results: Serum TNF-alpha levels were significantly higher in NS patients than in controls and in steroid resistant NS (SRNS) than in steroid sensitive NS (SSNS) (P < 0.001 for each). The risk of NS in patients carrying TNF-alpha 238 GA genotype, and TNF-alpha-308 GA or AA genotypes and allele A was significantly increased compared to healthy children. While no significant association was detected between TNF-alpha-863 and NS. The risk of resistance to steroid therapy was significantly high in NS carrying TNF-alpha-238 GA genotype and A allele, TNF-alpha-308, AA genotypes and A allele, and TNF-alpha-863 CA, AA genotypes and A allele. The TNF-alpha GCG (-308/-863/-238) haplotype has protective roles against NS and steroid resistance. However, the risk of NS was significantly high in TNF-alpha AAG and AAA haplotype's carriers compared to healthy children. Additionally the risk of steroid resistance was significantly high in TNF-alpha AAA haplotype's NS carrier (OR (95%C1): 2.2 (1.19-4.36), P = 0.01). Moreover, we found significant higher serum TNF-alpha levels NS patients including SSNS and SRNS carrying mutant allele TNF-alpha-238 GA genotype, 308 GA and AA and 863 CA and AA wild genotype's carriers than in those GG, GG and CC respectively. Interstingely, TNF-alpha levels were significantly higher in healthy children carrying TNF-alpha(-308/-863/-238) [AAG and AAA haplotypes], NS cases carrying [ACA, AAG, AAA haplotypes], and in SSNS carrying [ACA and AAA haplotypes] than in those carrying GCG, haplotype of wild alleles.
   Conclusion: This study reported, for the first time, that TNF-alpha promoter gene polymorphisms and/or haplotypes are risk factors of NS and resistance to steroid among Egyptian children.

ID CYTOTOXIC T-LYMPHOCYTES; SERUM; TH2
AB Background/aim The IgG4-related disease (IgG4-RD) is a fibroinflammatory condition that can affect almost any organ, often associated with eosinophilia and increased levels of IgE and IgG4. Overexpression in tissues of Th2related cytokines but also of IFN-y has been reported. Given the major role of I1-1 family cytokines in inducing and regulating inflammation, and the paucity of data so far available in IgG-RD, we performed a comprehensive analysis of IL-18, related IL-1 family cytokines and soluble receptors in these patients.
   Patients and Methods: Fifteen patients fulfilling the criteria for the diagnosis of IgG4-RD and 80 blood donors as control were recruited. Cytokines of the IL-1 family (IL-1 alpha, IL-1 beta, IL-33, IL-18), soluble receptors (sIL-1R1, sIL1R2, sIL-1R3, ST2/sIL-1R4) and antagonists (IL-1Ra, IL-18 binding protein-IL-18 BP-) were measured in sera by multiarray ELISA assay. Free IL-18 was calculated as the amount of IL-18 not inhibited by IL-18 BP.
   Results: Half of the patients had a multiorgan disease, mainly affecting retroperitoneum, lymph nodes and pancreas. sIL-1R1 (p = 0.0001), sIL-1R2 (p = 0.0024), ST2/sIL-1R4 (p = 0.002) were significantly increased in IgG4-RD sera compared with healthy controls; sIL-R3 was significantly lower in patients vs controls (p = 0,0006).
   Conclusions: The increased levels of the soluble forms of the two IL-1 receptors IL-1R1 and IL-1R2 suggest the need to dampen IL-I-mediated inflammation at the tissue level. Elevated circulating ST2/sIL-1R4 levels may represent the marker of an ongoing protective mechanism, but their contribution to organ damage cannot be excluded. On the whole, the data suggest a tight control of IL-1 family cytokines signalling in IgG4-RD.

AB The human stimulator of interferon gene (STING) is an important molecule in innate immunity that stimulates type I interferon (IFN) production. However, the role of duck STING (duSTING) in innate immunity has yet to be explained. In this study, the full length of the duSTING cDNA sequence (1149 bp), which encodes 382 amino acid (aa) residues, was reported and showed the highest sequence similarity with chicken STINGs. The phylogenetic analysis based on STING aa showed that duSTING was grouped onto the birds Glade. According to the tissue distribution spectrum analysis, duSTING was highly present in the bursa of Fabricius, glandular stomach, liver, pancreas, and small intestine of ducklings, as well as in the blood and pancreas of the adult duck. DuSTING mainly colocalized with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and mitochondria in transfected Baby Hamster Syrian Kidney (BHK21) and duck embryo fibroblasts (DEF) cells by an indirect immunofluorescence assay. The transfection of the DEFs with duSTING activated NF-kappa B, which induced the transcription of IFN-beta, and the activated IFN induced the interferon-stimulated response element (ISRE). Furthermore, the overexpression of duSTING significantly upregulated the mRNA level of duck IFN-beta and IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs), such as duMx and duOASL and inhibited the replication of the double-stranded DNA duck plague virus (DPV) in vitro. In addition, the knockdown of endogenous duSTING by shRNA significantly reduced the poly (I:C) (pIC), poly (dA:dT), and Tembusu virus (TMUV), induced IFN-beta production and significantly promoted DPV replication in vitro. In general, these data demonstrate that duSTING is vital for duck type I interferon induction and plays an important role in the host defence of DPV infection.

AB Biochar has been identified as a media amendment to improve nutrient removal from wastewater, and N retention and plant growth in agroforestry. It therefore has the potential for treating domestic wastewater. The aim of this research was to compare nitrogen removal and plant growth in pure sand and sand amended with biochar, in wetland mesocosms (240 L) receiving sewage. There were seven media treatments based on the proportions of biochar in the sand media (100% sand, sand and coir peat, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25% biochar). The plant species were Paperback tree (Melaleuca quinquenervia) and Lemongrass (Cymbopogon citratus). The mesocosms were continuously loaded for 8 months with secondary clarified wastewater (SCW) (16 L/day). Septage was then intermittently loaded (20 L/2 days) for a further 8 months. Inflow and outflow samples were monitored for TN, NH4-N, and NOx-N.
   All treatments showed good nitrogen removal efficiency. Average removal efficiencies of TN, NOx-N and NH4-N in the mesocosms loaded with SCW ranged from 71 to 87%, 81 to 93% and 65 to 79%, for 100% Sand to 25% Biochar respectively. For septage, the removal efficiencies ranged from 63 to 81%, 69 to 87% and 66 to 81%, for 100% Sand to 25% Biochar respectively. Significant differences of nitrogen outflow concentrations were observed between pure sand and sand amended with biochar. Physical chemical properties of the biochar would have facilitated microbial processes and adsorption. Strong positive correlations were observed between biochar content in the media and nitrogen removal rates. The increased nitrogen removal may be attributed to higher mineralisation of organic nitrogen and NH4-N, especially in the case of septage where strong correlation was observed between BOD5 and TN removal. Total N biomass in the plants harvested after 21 months ranged from 13.4-14.0 g N. The addition of biochar did not increase plant N biomass in either species.

AB Large-scale sand control and afforestation in the Mu Us Sandy land of China have greatly improved soil nutrients and physicochemical properties; however, little is known about their effects on soil biological properties. This study aimed to investigate the changes in soil microbial biomass and enzyme activities and their relationships with soil physicochemical properties during sand land rehabilitation. Soil samples were collected from the shrub and arbor plantations with an age sequence of 20, 30, and 51 years in Yulin at depths of 0-10 cm and 10-20 cm and with semi-fixed sand land selected as a control (0-year-old site). The soil physicochemical and biological properties in the 0-10 cm soil layer were significantly (P < 0.001) higher than in the 10-20 cm soil layer for all stand lands. The soil microbial biomass (e.g., microbial carbon and nitrogen) in the 0-10 cm and 10-20 cm layers greatly increased, by 1.58-5.59 times and 2.27-6.07 times, respectively, during the revegetation of shrub and arbor from 20 to 30 years on the control land. During the same period, the activities of soil catalase, urease, alkaline phosphatase and invertase also greatly increased, by 1.27-2.18, 0.59-1.23, 0.48-3.66 and 0.57-2.72 times in shrub land, respectively, whereas they increased by 1.51-2.73, 0.46-2.09, 0.97-2.79 and 2.00-6.65 times in arbor land, respectively, compared with the control land. However, during the 30-51 years of revegetation on the control land, the soil microbial biomass and all enzyme activities remained relatively stable or slightly increased in the arbor land, whereas they were reduced in the shrub land. The soil organic carbon (SOC), dissolved organic carbon (DOC), total nitrogen (TN) and available nitrogen (AN) contents also greatly increased after revegetation in the control land. Principal component analysis (PCA) also confirmed that most of the chemical and biological properties were influenced by the afforestation and showed coordinated variation between the analyzed parameters. Moreover, redundancy analysis (RDA) showed that the soil microbial biomass and enzyme activities were correlated with the changes of SOC, DOC and TN, whereas they were negatively correlated with the bulk density, pH and total potassium. Therefore, we concluded that revegetation by the establishment of both shrub and arbor plantations significantly improved soil biological properties. Moreover, SOC, DOC and TN were regarded as the key factors in the enhancement of soil biological activity during desertified land revegetation in the Mu Us Sandy land of China.

AB Inoculation of phosphate solubilizing bacteria (PSB) and phosphorus mobilizing arbuscular mycorrhiza (AM) with low quality rock phosphate (RP) can be an alternative source to one of the costliest phosphatic fertilizers in India, i. e. single superphosphate, by enhancing phosphorus influx and modification of root properties. Co-inoculation of PSB and AM may play a pivotal role to reduce phosphorus application through RP. Root properties and grain yield of irrigated soybean-wheat cropping system were evaluated with two levels of RP {100 and 50% recommended P (1.0 RP and 0.5 RP)} and different combinations of PSB and AM with 0.5 RP (0.5 RP + PSB, 0.5 RP + AM and 0.5 RP + PSB+ AM) versus 100% recommended P application through soluble single superphosphate (1.0 SP) in the Indo-Gangetic plains. The P influx under 0.5 RP + PSB + AM and 1.0 SP were statistically at par with each other and the former treatment provided 0.6 and 3.2% higher value than the later in soybean and wheat, respectively. The root surface area density (RSAD) of soybean and wheat under 0.5 RP + PSB+ AM (13.71 and 6.16 m(2) m(-3), respectively) and 1.0 SP (13.70 and 6.37 m(2) m(-3), respectively) were non-significant and almost equal with each other. The values of root cation exchange capacity and other root properties under 0.5 RP + PSB+ AM and 1.0 SP were also non-significant. The improved root properties under 0.5 RP + PSB+ AM provided statistically at par grain yield with 1.0 SP for both soybean and wheat crops. The yield under 0.5 RP + PSB+ AM of soybean crop was 3.4% higher than 1.0 SP. The net returns US$(-1) invested was significantly higher under 0.5 RP + PSB+ AM compared to 1.0 SP for both soybean and wheat crops. Co-inoculation of PSB and AM with 50% of recommended P through RP could be recommended for better root properties and profitable grain yield of soybean-wheat cropping system in the Indo-Gangetic alluvial plains.

AB A horizontal, subsurface, laboratory-scale constructed wetland (CW) consisting of four cells in series was used to determine the attenuation of the steroid hormone estrone (E1) present in animal wastewater. Liquid swine manure diluted 1: 80 with farm pond water and dosed with [C-14] E1 flowed through the series of cells containing floating vegetation (duckweed, family Lemnaceae) and a sand: gravel sediment layer. The aqueous layer within each cell was sampled across time, and at 168 h duckweed and sediment were sampled for E1 and/ or its metabolites. Control and Blank systems consisted of single cells with no vegetation or no vegetation/ sediment, respectively. Only 5% of the dose was detected in the effluent at 168 h. With the use of mass spectrometry and thin layer chromatography, it was determined that E1 was metabolized into estriol (E3) and to polar metabolites. The largest compartment for [C-14] was duckweed (42.1% of administered dose) at 168 h followed by sediment (17.3%) and the liquid layer (15.1% of the dose). Most of the vegetative removal of E1 occurred in the first cell, and thereafter, sediment: liquid layer interactions governed E1 movement suggesting particle-bound transport on either colloids or dissolved organic matter. Horizontal, subsurface flow CW were able to remove approximately 95% of the influent E1, and demonstrated the importance of vegetative matter in removal of this potent steroid hormone.

AB The effect of high flows on total phosphorus (TP) removal in a 40-ha periphyton-based stormwater treatment area wetland (PSTA Cell) located in Stormwater Treatment Area (STA)-3/4 was evaluated by subjecting the PSTA Cell to three short-duration (3-day) hydraulic (high-inflow) pulses. The intent was to mimic hydraulic conditions that would be experienced during large storm events should the PSTA concept be implemented throughout the complex of treatment wetlands (STAs) operated by the South Florida Water Management District for Everglades restoration. The average inflow rate to the PSTA Cell during the pulses (1.3-2.0 m3 s(-1)) was approximately three to four times higher than under normal operation. The hydraulic loading rates (HLRs) during the pulses (28-43 cm d(-1)) matched the peak 3-day HLRs observed in STA-3/4 during high inflows associated with storm runoff. Correspondingly, the phosphorus loading rates (PLRs) and hydraulic retention times (HRTs) during the pulses (2.3-6.3 mg m(-2) d(-1) and 1.4-1.8 days, respectively) were substantially higher and lower, respectively, compared to PLRs and HRTs in the PSTA Cell under normal operation. No reduction in TP removal performance was observed in the PSTA Cell during the pulses, and there was no indication that post-pulse outflow TP concentrations increased compared to pre-pulse levels in response to the pulse events. The short-term increase in hydraulic and TP loads during this study did not compromise the treatment efficacy of the PSTA Cell. If implementable in a cost-effective manner in the STAs, the PSTA concept could be part of a treatment strategy that achieves TP effluent limits mandated for these wetlands.

AB Constructed wetlands, which are commonly used in wastewater treatment, are difficult to use for stormwater treatment, because the water level variation in a stormwater pond makes it difficult for rooted vegetation to survive. As an alternative, vegetation can be grown on floating mats, called floating treatment islands (FTI), with roots extending downward into the water. Nutrient removal is achieved through uptake and trapping by the matrix of roots and bio-film. The overall treatment provided by a pond with FTIs depends on the fraction of flow exposed to the root zone. This study used numerical modeling to study the flow through the root zone, with the goal of determining which configuration of FTI achieved the greatest overall treatment. Six different configurations were considered, all with root zone volume equal to 11% of the pond volume. The permeability of the root zone was estimated using velocity measurements within real floating vegetation. A first-order removal rate within the root zone (k(r)) was estimated from removal rates reported in the literature. Preliminary studies considered the similarity in flow and removal between systems of different physical scale. Geometric similarity of the root zone guaranteed flow similarity within the root zone. To achieve performance similarity (same mass reduction), systems need to have the same non-dimensional removal rate (k(r)t(n), with t(n) the nominal residence time of the pond). The consideration of different FTI configurations showed that wakes generated by upstream FTIs lowered the mass removal of downstream FTIs, so that segmenting a single large FTI into multiple smaller FTIs in series did not improve overall nutrient removal. However, segmenting a single FTI into a pair of parallel FTIs did improve the nutrient removal, and this configuration provided the best pond-scale removal.

AB The aim of this work was to answer the question wheather woodland can be established spontaneously in a variety of disturbed sites. We analyzed 10 successional series lasting at least 80 years which were located across the Czech Republic, central Europe. The woody species were classified into early and late successional species. Species typical for the respective potential natural vegetation described for Czech woodland were considered as late successional while all the other species were classed as early successional. Data were processed using multivariate analyses and GLM. Cover and the number of woody species gradually increased during succession, and woodland established spontaneously in all series. The relative cover of early successional species reached its peak on average after 40-50 years of succession or gradually decreased in the model since the first year of site abandonment while that of late successional species gradually increased. However, the series largely differed and some of them did not follow the trends. Betula spp. (early) appeared to be by far the most frequent colonizer followed by Pinus sylvestris (late). Spontaneous establishment of woodland can be an effective method for ecosystem restoration in a range of disturbed sites within central Europe. Proportion of alien species was mostly low.

AB The alpine meadow ecosystem on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau has degenerated greatly in recent decades. The most effective means of restoration for severely degraded grasslands is rebuilding artificial grasslands. However, the effects of converting severely degraded grasslands to artificial grasslands on soil respiration and the relationships between soil respiration and carbon and nitrogen storage remain unclear. Therefore, we evaluated soil respiration and carbon and nitrogen storage on native grasslands with different levels of degradation (no degradation (ND), lightly degraded (LD), moderately degraded (MD) and severely degraded (SD)); the study was on a perennial artificial grassland with different restoration years (cultivated for 3 years (A3) and cultivated for 16 years (A16)) and on an annual oat grassland in an alpine meadow of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau and applied a structural equation model to explore the relative contributions of biotic and abiotic variables in the regulation of soil respiration. Our results demonstrated that grassland degradation significantly decreased the growing season soil respiration, annual mean soil respiration, vegetation, and the soil and ecosystem carbon and nitrogen storage. Meanwhile, the establishment of annual oat grasslands significantly decreased the growing season soil respiration, annual mean soil respiration, 0-30 cm soil layer and ecosystem carbon and nitrogen storage, whereas it significantly increased the vegetation carbon and nitrogen storage. In contrast, the perennial artificial grassland had no significant effect on the growing season soil respiration or on the annual mean soil respiration but significantly increased the forage yield and ecosystem carbon and nitrogen storage. Grassland degradation and artificial grassland establishment had no significant effect on the dormant season soil respiration. Furthermore, soil moisture had a greater impact on growing season soil respiration, whereas soil temperature had a more significant effect on the dormant season soil respiration. Furthermore, a structural equation model indicated that the carbon storage in the roots and the 0-10 cm soil layer were two important biotic factors that controlled soil respiration. Considering the ecological and productive properties, establishing a perennial artificial grassland could be the best strategy for restoring the black-soil-type grasslands native to the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau.

AB Sugarcane-molasses based distillery waste is a threat to environment for its safe disposal due to complexation of endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) containing mixture of organic pollutants. This study revealed that distillery sludge contains not only mixture of complex organic pollutants but also retains high quantity of Fe (5264.49), Zn (43.47), Cu (847.46), Mn (238.47), Ni (15.60), and Pb (31.22 mg kg(-1)) which enhances the toxicity of sludge to the environment. The major identified organic compounds were benzene, 1-ethyl-2-methyl, benzene, 1-ethyl-4-methyl benzoic acid, 3,4,5-tris(TMS oxy), TMS ester; hexanedioic acid, dioctyl ester; stigmasterol TMS ether; 5a-cholestane, 4-methylene; campesterol TMS; beta-sitosterol and lanosterol. These compounds are listed under the EDCs also as per U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. However, the phytoextraction potential of growing native weeds and grasses i.e. Argemone mexicana, Saccharum munja, Cynodon dactylon, Pennisetum purpureum, Chenopodium album, Rumex dentatus, Tinospora cordifolia, Calotropis procera and Basella alba revealed the high accumulation of Fe, Zn, Cu, Mn, Ni, and Pb in their root and leaves compared to shoot. This indicated high accumulation and translocation capabilities of these plants. Further, the bioaccumulation coefficient factor (BCF) and translocation factor (TF) was found >1 for majority of plants for various metals. Thus, this given strong evidence for hyperaccumulation tendency of these native weeds and grasses from complex polluted sites. Furthermore, the ultrastructural observations of root tissues also revealed the deposition of heavy metals at various cellular components without any apparent toxic effects. This indicated the variable adaptive characteristics of these plants growing at a hazardous waste polluted site. Thus, the study given a strong evidence for application of these weeds and grasses as tools for in-situ phytoremediation and eco-restoration of polluted sites.

AB Removal of invasive species is often an important, if not central, component of many riparian restoration projects, however little is known about the response of plant communities following this practice. In particular, active control of the exotic, dominant tree Tamarix spp is often a focus of riparian restoration, much of which occurring against a backdrop of biological control by a folivore beetle. Our research employed controls in both time and space to investigate the impact of active Tamarix removal methods in sites subjected to biological control in 40 sites sampled three times over a period of five years. We found that reduction in Tamarix cover was much greater over time with active means of removal, however the native understory increased both with and without active removal. Importantly, change in the relative cover of understory native species was significantly negatively correlated with change in Tamarix cover, with those sites that received a combination of low-disturbance-mechanical, chemical and bio-control showing greater increases in native understory dominance than those sites with biological control alone or high-disturbance mechanical control. Sites with only biocontrol still contained 10% live Tamarix cover > 7 yr since the beetle was released there. Taken together, these results suggest that the reduction of this exotic tree, even by biological control that leaves some canopy intact, can facilitate recovery of the native plant community. As such, this study supports the Field of Dreams hypothesis that states that once niches are restored, native plants should be able to recolonize.

AB In many regions of the world, subsidence of organic rich soils threatens levee stability and freshwater supply, and continued oxidative loss of organic matter contributes to greenhouse gas production. To counter subsidence in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta of northern California, we examined the feasibility of using constructed wetlands receiving drainage water treated with metal-based coagulants to accrete mineral material along with wetland biomass, while also sequestering carbon in wetland sediment. Nine field-scale wetlands were constructed which received local drainage water that was either untreated (control), or treated with polyaluminum chloride (PAC) or iron sulfate (FeSO4) coagulants. After twenty three months of flooding and coagulant treatment, sediment samples were collected near the inlet, middle, and outlet of each wetland to determine vertical accretion rates, bulk density, sediment composition, and carbon sequestration rates. Wetlands treated with PAC had the highest and most spatially consistent vertical accretion rates (similar to 6 cm yr(-1)), while the FeSO4 wetlands had similarly high accretion rates near the inlet but rates similar to the untreated wetland (similar to 1.5 cm yr(-1)) at the middle and outlet sites. The composition of the newly accreted sediment in the PAC and FeSO4 treatments was high in the added metal (aluminum and iron, respectively), but the percent metal by weight was similar to native soils of California. As has been observed in other constructed wetlands, the newly accreted sediment material ha d lower bulk densities than the native soil material (0.04-0.10 g cm(-3) versus 0.2-0.3 g cm(-3)), suggesting these materials will consolidate over time. Finally, this technology accelerated carbon burial, with rates in PAC treated wetland (0.63 kg C m(-2) yr(-1)) over 2-fold greater than the untreated control (0.28 kg C m(-2) yr(-1)). This study demonstrates the feasibility of using constructed wetlands treated with coagulants to reverse subsidence by accreting the resulting organo-metal flocculent and storing carbon at rates exceeding untreated wetlands. Management and design questions remain for how to best integrate this technology into heavily subsided land to lower the risks and consequences associated with levee failure, improve water quality, and ultimately restore these lands to tidal wetlands.

AB Macrophages are common targets for infection and innate immune activation by many pathogenic viruses including the neurotropic Theiler's Murine Encephalomyelitis Virus (TMEV). As both infection and innate activation of macrophages are key determinants of viral pathogenesis especially in the central nervous system (CNS), an analysis of macrophage growth factors on these events was performed. C3H mouse bone-marrow cells were differentiated in culture using either recombinant macrophage colony stimulating factor (M-CSF) or granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), inoculated with TMEV (BeAn) and analyzed at various times thereafter. Cytokine RNA and protein analysis, virus titers, and flow cytometry were performed to characterize virological parameters under these culture conditions. GM-CSF-differentiated macrophages showed higher levels of TMEV viral RNA and proinflammatory molecules compared to infected M-CSF-differentiated cells. Thus, GM-CSF increases both TMEV infection and TMEV-induced activation of macrophages compared to that seen with M-CSF. Moreover, while infectious viral particles decreased from a peak at 12 h to undetectable levels at 48 h post infection, TMEV viral RNA remained higher in GM-CSF- compared to M-CSF-differentiated macrophages in concert with increased proinflammatory gene expression. Analysis of a possible basis for these differences determined that glycolytic rates contributed to heightened virus replication and proinflammatory cytokine secretion in GM-CSF compared to M-CSF-differentiated macrophages. In conclusion, we provide evidence implicating a role for GM-CSF in promoting virus replication and proinflammatory cytokine expression in macrophages, indicating that GM-CSF may be a key factor for TMEV infection and the induction of chronic TMEV-induced immunopathogenesis in the CNS.

AB Leukemic cells can induce defective expression of soluble factors and change marrow cytokine profile, leading to aberrant cell signaling, cell fixation and cell proliferation in bone marrow. T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) is an aggressive disorder which accounts for 15% of pediatric ALL. To evaluate the contribution of immunological factors On T-ALL survival, we measured Thl, Th2, Th17 cytokines and soluble HLA-G (sHLA-G) levels in bone marrow from 32 Brazilian children at diagnosis (DO), after induction (D19) and after consolidation (D49) of the chemotherapy phase. Data were analyzed using non-parametric tests, and survival rates were evaluated by Kaplan-Meier method (log-rank test). TNF, IL-10 and IL-6 levels were increased at diagnosis compared to D19 and D49. IL-10 levels < 4.57 pg/mL at diagnosis were associated with increased survival rate, in presence of positive correlation between IL-2 and IL-17 levels. Increased survival rate was also associated with IFN-gamma levels <= 1.17 pg/mL at D49, with a positive correlation observed between IL-4 and IL-2 as well IL-4 and IL-17 levels. In contrast, worse survival rate was associated with IL-2, IL-4 and IL-10 levels imbalance. In addition, increased sHLA-G levels at diagnosis were associated with increased leukocyte count, a well-known factor for poor prognosis. In conclusion, cytokines and sHLA-G play an essential role in marrow T-ALL micro environment during chemotherapy, especially the immunosuppressive cytokine IL-10 which can be used as biomarker of disease outcome, being also a potential target for novel T-ALL treatments.

AB Aim: This study evaluates and correlates the number of myocarditis focuses and production of cytokines in Rattus norvegicus (Wistar lineage), experimentally infected with T. Cruzi and treated with Phosphorus.
   Methods: In two blind, controlled and randomized trials, 53 45-day-old, male animals were allocated into groups Control (n = 24): Control group infected and treated with 7% hydroalcoholic solution, the preparation vehicle of the test medication; and Phosphorus (n = 24 on days 0, 5, 10 and 24 after infection): group infected and treated with Phosphorus 13cH, diluted 10-26 and dynamized (test medication). The animals were inoculated intraperitoneally with 5 x 106 blood trypomastigotes of T. cruzi-Y strain. The medication was administered overnight (16 consecutive hours), diluted in water (1 mL/100 mL) in amber water bottles. The animals were treated 2 days before and 2, 4, and 6 days after infection. Enumeration of inflammatory foci in cardiac tissue (Hematoxylin-Eosin) and dosage of cytokines TNF-a and IFN-y in the serum were performed on days 0, 5, 10 and 24 after infection, using three animals/group. Mann-Whitney, Friedman ANOVA, Spearman correlation (p < 0.05), and Statistica Single User Software version 13.2 were used for data analysis.
   Results: The animals treated with Phosphorus 13cH had high concentration of INF-gamma on the 5th day of infection with significant decrease on the 10th and 24th days (p < 0.05), and high concentration of TNF-alpha on the 5th and 10th days of infection with decrease on the 24th day (p < 0.05). The treatment with Phosphorus caused a significant increase of INF-gamma and TNF-alpha on the 5th day of infection compared with the Control (p < 0.05), with reestablishment on the 24th day, as well as in the Control group. The group treated with Phosphorus had 52.5% less number of myocarditis focuses in heart than Control group (p < 0.05) on the 10th day of infection. The significant increase in cytokines on the5th day of infection in the Phosphorus group is related to a significant decrease in the number of inflammatory foci in cardiac tissue on the 10th day of infection in this group.
   Discussion and conclusion: Treatment with Phosphorus 13CH promotes beneficial effects in T. crust infection in Wistar rats by modulating the secretion of IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha with decreased inflammation in cardiac tissue. These results reinforce the importance of considering the use of homeopathy for establishing new therapeutic approaches in the management of patients with Chagas disease.

AB Thymus-derived regulatory T cells of CD4 + CD25 + Foxp3 + phenotype develop as a functional, mature population playing an essential role in self-tolerance and immune homeostasis, and exhibiting therapeutic potential to inhibit adverse immune response. Despite intensive research on thymus-derived Tregs, the knowledge about agents involved in their generation, survival, proliferation, and biological functions is still insufficient. In this research we have focused on the role of selected cytokines in previously developed in vitro model based on the application of anti-CD3 monoclonal antibodies. We have demonstrated an essential role of IL-7 and TGF-beta in the generation of thymus-derived Tregs in the co-culture of thymocytes and JAWS II cells. In addition, in vitro generated Tregs exhibited their suppressive function similarly to Tregs sorted from freshly isolated thymus.

AB Bacicground: Gamma delta (gamma delta) T cells are known to link innate and adaptive immunity. Decidual yS T cells are known to provide immunotolerance by producing IL-10 and TGF-beta. In recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL) females, the role of peripheral gamma delta T cells remain unstudied.
   Objective: To investigate the different phenotypes of gamma delta T cells in the peripheral blood of women with idiopathic RPL and their possible involvement in RPL condition.
   Methods: A total of 120 women were recruited for the study. Peripheral blood lymphocytes were isolated and they were stained with appropriate antibodies to determine the phenotype of gamma delta T cells and major cytokines produced by them in the blood using flow cytometry.
   Results: We observed a significant decrease in the proportion of CD31-CD4 CD8-gamma delta T cells (p < 0.001) and increase in the percentage of IFN-gamma (p < 0.05) and IL-17 (p < 0.001) producing gamma delta T cells in RPL pregnant as compared to normal pregnant females.
   Conclusion: Increase in IFN-gamma and IL-17-producing CD3 CD4-CD8 gamma delta T cells is associated with creating inflammatory cytokine milieu, thereby, may contribute towards pregnancy loss in RPL females.

AB Aims: Inflammation plays a crucial role in aneurysm wall remodeling, which could lead to the rupture of intracranial aneurysms. Stromal cell-derived factor la (SDF-1 alpha), a vital inflammation cytokine, is also related to aneurysm pathogenesis. However, the characteristics of SDF-1 alpha expression and its role in aneurysm remodeling remain largely unknown. In this study, we aimed to investigate the expression dynamics of SDF-1 alpha and its correlation with aneurysm remodeling.
   Methods: Saccular aneurysms were induced by porcine pancreatic elastase in New Zealand White rabbits. Aneurysm size was measured by digital subtraction angiography. Endothelial-like cells on the aneurysm wall were assessed on postoperative days 1, 3, 7, 14, 21, and 30. SDF-1 alpha levels in the aneurysmal wall and serum were examined at several follow-up time points. Adherent molecule expression was examined, and migration assays were performed in vitro. After SDF-1 alpha stimulation, the mobilization of endothelial-lineage cells and its role in the reendothelialization of the aneurysm wall were investigated in a saccular aneurysm rabbit model.
   Results: After the creation of saccular aneurysms in rabbits, the aneurysm sacs were filled with acute thrombosis within 3 days, followed by a significant enlargement on day 14 and maturation on day 21. Serum SDF-1 alpha levels increased in a bimodal fashion on day 1 and day 14, whereas SDF-1 alpha expression in the aneurysm wall reached its maximum on day 14. VE-cadherin was up-regulated after SDF-1 alpha stimulation and down-regulated by the SDF-1 alpha ligand blocker AMD3100. Endothelial progenitor cell migration was enhanced by SDF-1 alpha and blocked by AMD3100. The in vivo administration of SDF-alpha to rabbits with saccular aneurysms promoted endothelial-lineage cell mobilization into the peripheral blood and reendothelialization of the aneurysm wall.
   Conclusions: The SDF-1 alpha expression level in the peripheral blood and local aneurysm wall correlated with the aneurysm remodeling process in rabbits with elastase-induced saccular aneurysms. We conclude that SDF-1 alpha may facilitate aneurysm wall remodeling by up-regulating VE-cadherin expression and mobilizing endothelial lineage cells.

AB Early acting cytokines and growth factors such as those of the CD131(beta c) subunit, may offer an alternative method to the current use of antibiotics and chemicals such as anthelmintics in maintaining Porcine (Po) health. Thus far, the recombinant Po (rPo) Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), rPo interleukin-3 (IL-3) and rPo interleukin-5 (IL-5) proteins have been identified and cloned and the biological activity of each cytokine has been confirmed in vitro, however, in vivo immune system regulation and hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) augmentation are regulated by numerous cytokines and cellular signals within the bone marrow (BM) niche. In order to quantify the use of recombinant cytokines in augmenting the immune response, it is necessary to determine the stages of hematopoiesis induced by each cytokine and possible areas of synergy requiring further investigation. Here we used the chemotherapeutic agent 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), to chemically induce a state of myelosuppression in young pigs. This allowed for the monitoring of both the autologous BM reconstitution and recombinant cytokine induced BM repopulation, precursor cell proliferation and cellular differ. entiation. The recombinant cytokines PoGM-CSF, PoIL-3 and PoIL-5 were administered by intramuscular injections (i.m.) following confirmation of 5-FU induced leukocytopenia. Blood and BM samples were collected and then analysed for cell composition. Statistically significant results were observed in several blood cell populations including eosinophils for animals treated with rPoIL-5, rPoGM-CSF and basophils for animals treated with rPoIL-3. BM analysis of CD90(+) and CD172a(+) cells confirmed myelosuppression in week one with significant results observed between rPoIL-3 and the 5-FU control group in week two and for the rPoGM-CSF group in week three. These results have demonstrated the effects of each of these rPo cytokines within the hematopoietic processes of the pig and may demonstrate similar outcomes in other mammalian models including human.

AB THP-1 monocytes were used to evaluate the effects of physiological levels of resveratrol aglycone, resveratrol-3-O-glucuronide, resveratrol-4'-O-glucuronide, and resveratrol-3-O-sulfate on phagocytosis, IL-1 beta, IL-1 alpha, and IL 18 production, viability, and TLR2 and TLR4 expression. THP-1 cells were treated with 1, 5, 10, and 15 mu M resveratrol or metabolites. Resveratrol-3-O-glucuronide, resveratrol-4'-0-glucuronide, and resveratrol-3-O-sulfate had no effect on the functional parameters tested. Resveratrol aglycone increased phagocytosis at concentrations of 5, 10, and 15 M and LPS-induced IL-10 production at concentrations of 10 and 15 mu M. Expression of TLR4 increased slightly after resveratrol treatment, but surface expression of TLR2 was reduced as resveratrol concentrations increased. Our data suggest that resveratrol may be effective in modulating monocyte function in an environment where there is direct exposure to the aglycone, such as at the gut epithelium.

AB Physical activity is associated with decreased breast cancer risk. The underlying biological mechanisms could include the reduction of the local inflammation in the breast tissue. We conducted a cross-sectional study to assess the association between the physical activity and the protein expression levels of eleven mediators of inflammation in normal breast tissue of 164 women having breast cancer. Information on total physical activity (household, occupational and recreational) performed during a one-year period was collected using a questionnaire. Normal breast tissue was obtained from mastectomy blocks distant from the tumor. The expression of the mediators of inflammation in normal breast tissue was visually evaluated by immunohistochemistry. Multivariate linear regression analyses were used to assess the prevalence ratios (PR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for higher protein expression levels of the mediators of inflammation in normal breast tissue across quartiles of physical activity. Higher total physical activity was associated with lower expression levels of the pro-inflammatory mediator TNF-a in normal breast epithelial tissue among all (PR = 0.64, 95% CI = 0.44-0.93 for the fourth quartile;-trend = 0.013), premenopausal (PR = 0.61, 95% CI = 0.41-0.91 for the fourth quartile; -trend = 0.014) and postmenopausal women (PR = 0.45, 95% CI = 0.21-0.96 for the fourth quartile; -trend = 0.022). Conversely, higher total physical activity was associated with higher expression levels of the anti-inflammatory mediator IL-10 in normal breast epithelial tissue among all (PR = 1.66, 95% CI = 0.97-2.85 for the fourth quartile; P-trend = 0.071) and postmenopausal women (PR = 4.69, 95% CI = 1.26-17.43 for the fourth quartile; P-trend = 0.010). Our findings suggest a beneficial effect of physical activity on the local inflammatory profile in the breast tissue.

AB In this study, we investigated the relationship between serum level of IL-27 with preeclampsia and its severity. Fifty-six preeclamptic, 21 health pregnant and 20 health nonpregnant women formed the study group. The levels of IL-27 in maternal circulation were determined by ELISA. IL-27 serum levels were found to be elevated in healthy pregnant and preeclamptic groups as compared to non-pregnant women, this increase was significant in preeclamptic cases (p = 0.0004). Moreover, a significant difference of IL-27 serum level was observed between groups and the healthy pregnant controls, (p = 0.0095). Notably, the level of IL-27 was considerably elevated in women with severe preeclampsia, but not with mild preeclampsia as compared with healthy pregnant women (p = 0.0056, p = 0.0964, respectively). Furthermore, IL-27 serum levels were significantly differences in early onset and late onset sever preeclampsia than in gestation matched healthy pregnancies (p = 0.0376, p = 0.0085, respectively). In conclusion, our results suggest IL-27 might be a useful biomarker for disease severity in preeclampsia.

TI High levels of IL-6 and IL-8 characterize early-on idiopathic pulmonary

ID BIOMARKERS; PROFILES
AB Introduction: Controversy exists about the pathogenesis of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis acute exacerbations (IPF-AEs). According to one hypothesis IPF-AEs represent the development of any etiology diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) upon usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP), whilst other researchers argue that an accelerated phase of the intrinsic fibrotic process of unknown etiology prevails, leading to ARDS. Different cytokines might be involved in both processes. The aim of this study was to assess pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic cytokines in the peripheral blood from stable and exacerbated IPF patients.
   Methods: Consecutive IPF patients referred to our department were included. Diagnoses of IPF and IPF-AE were based on international guidelines and consensus criteria. The interleukins (IL)-4, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, and IL-13 as well as active transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-(3) were measured in blood from both stable and exacerbated patients on the day of hospital admission for deterioration. Subjects were followed for 12 months. Mann-Whitney test as well as Tobit and logistic regression analyses were applied.
   Results: Among the 41 patients studied, 23 were stable, and 18 under exacerbation; of the latter, 12 patients survived. The IL-6 and IL-8 levels were significantly higher in exacerbated patients (p = 0.002 and p = 0.046, respectively). An increase in either IL-6 or IL-8 by 1 pg/ml increases the odds of death by 5.6% (p = 0.021) and 6.7% (p = 0.013), respectively, in all patients. No differences were detected for the other cytokines.
   Conclusion: High levels of IL-6 and IL-8 characterize early-on IPF-AEs and an increase in the levels of IL-6 and IL 8 associates with worse outcome in all patients. However, as the most representative pro-fibrotic cytokines, TGF1.3, IL-10, IL-4 and IL-13 were not increased and given the dualistic nature, both pro-inflammatory and pro fibrotic of IL-6 further studies are necessary to clarify the enigma of IPF-AEs etiopathogenesis.

AB Oxidative stress-induced mitochondrial function and cell apoptosis to osteoblasts, plays a critical role in the pathophysiology of osteoporosis. However, mechanisms underlying such process remain not yet clear. We aims in this study to investigate a possible role of SMAD (the mothers against decapentaplegic homolog 4 (SMAD4) in the oxidative stress-induced apoptosis, in homo sapiens osteoblast hFOB1.19 cells. Results demonstrated that the treatment with more than 100 mu M H2O2 significantly downregulated the cellular viability, whereas markedly induced apoptosis in hFOB1.19 cells. The SMAD4 was markedly reduced in both mRNA and protein levels in the H2O2-treated hFOB1.19 cells, along with the reduction of Small ubiquitin-related modifier 1 (SUMO 1) and SUMO 2/3. The immunoprecipitation assay confirmed indicated the interaction between SUMO 1 (or SUMO 2/3) and SMAD4. Moreover, the SMAD4 overexpression markedly ameliorated the H2O2-resulted viability reduction and apoptosis induction in hFOB1.19 cells. Interestingly, such amelioration was blocked by the knockdown of SUMO 2/3. Taken together, we conclued that SMAD4 inhibits the H2O2-induced apoptosis in osteoblast hFOB1.19 cells; such inhibition might depend on the SUMOylation by SUMO 2/3. It implies a promising role of SMAD4 in oxidative stress-promoted damage to osteoblasts.

AB Introduction: Cytokine composition of bone marrow microenvironment in comparison to blood is poorly explored. The goal of this study was to investigate the levels of cytokines present in peripheral blood and bone marrow of healthy hematopoietic stem cells donors. The data obtained on this subject with addition to cytometric analysis can provide new insight into the hematopoietic stem cells microenvironment.
   Methodology: Study consisted of cytokine concentration analysis performed by ELISA tests of peripheral blood of healthy peripheral blood stem cells donors and bone marrow of healthy bone marrow donors. Additionally we have tested the expression of CD47 and CD274 proteins on the surface of hematopoietic stem cells by the flow cytometry analysis.
   Results: The results has shown different composition of analyzed cytokines (IL-1 13, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, IL-17A, TGF-beta 1, IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha) present in bone marrow and blood of stem cells donors. The hematopoietic stem cells in peripheral blood are subjected to higher levels of proinflammatory cytokines whilst the lower level of those cytokines in bone marrow with a very high level of TGF-beta 1 which possibly creates a more immunosuppressive environment. The IL-10 level was significantly higher in peripheral blood of PBSC donors after the administration of mobilizing factor (G-CSF). The percentage of CD47 + HSCs was significantly higher in bone marrow compared to peripheral blood of mobilized donors.

AB Fibroblast to myofibroblast transition (FMT) contributes to bronchial wall remodelling in persistent asthma. Among other numerous factors involved, transforming growth factor type beta (TGF-beta) plays a pivotal role. Recently it has been demonstrated that connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), a matricellular protein, combines with TGF-beta in the pathomechanism of many fibrotic disorders. However, it is not clear whether this interaction takes place in asthma as well.
   Primary cultures of human bronchial fibroblasts from asthmatic and non-asthmatic subjects were used to investigate the impact of CTGF and TGF-beta(1) on the fibroblast to myofibroblast transition. The combined activity of TGF-beta(1) and CTGF resulted in an average of 90% of FMT accomplished in cell lines derived from asthmatics. In this group FMT was highly dependent on the presence of CTGF produced by the cells, as shown by gene silencing experiments with the specific siRNA.
   Results support the important role of CTGF biosynthesis in the asthmatic bronchi amplifying FMT. This is evidenced by inhibition of TGF-beta(1)-induced FMT following CTGF silencing in asthmatic bronchial fibroblasts. CTGF is produced by fibroblasts and contributes to the FMT phenomenon in positive loop-back, inducing and boosting TGF-beta(1) triggered FMT. Thus, CTGF is a promising target for pharmacological intervention in secondary prevention of bronchial remodelling in asthma.

AB Hepatitis C virus (HCV) chronic infection causes severe cellular immune dysfunction. Here, we investigated the production of Th17-associated cytokines by peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of untreated patients with HCV, patients presenting an early virologic response (EVR) after 12 weeks of treatment with interferon-a plus ribavirin with or without HCV protease inhibitors, and patients who were nonresponders to HCV therapy. PBMCs were stimulated with HCV core and nonstructural antigens, and the production of Th17-associated cytokines was measured with a Milliplex MAP immunoassay. Core-stimulated PBMCs from both untreated and nonresponder patients produced interleukin (IL)-17A, and vigorous production of IL-17A in response to NS3 antigen was only verified in the untreated group. Nonresponder patients also produced IL-17F after core antigen stimulation. IL-21 production was unaltered in the three groups of patients, whereas IL-17E and IL-22 were not detected. The production of Th17 cytokines by cells from patients showing an EVR was insignificant. IL-17A and IL-17F levels were not correlated with alanine aminotransferase levels or viremia. However, advanced fibrosis was associated with higher IL-17A production in TO cells stimulated with core antigen. Untreated patients with HCV and patients who were nonresponders to antiviral treatment differed in their PBMC immune responses of Th17-associated cytokines. The early virological response to antiviral treatment dramatically decreased Th17 immune responses to HCV antigens.

AB Background: The IL-10 dependent regulatory function of B cells had recently more and more investigated and play important roles in cancer immunity, however, beyond IL-10 whether other inhibitory cytokines play an important role in cancer is lacking. Here, we investigated the role of IL-35 producing B cells in colorectal cancer (CRC).
   Methods: Thirty-two healthy controls (HC) and 49 untreated CRC patients were enrolled and the IL-35 producing B cells in the peripheral blood were investigated. Additionally, CD4(+)CD25(+/high)CD127(low/-) regulatory T (Treg) and CD14(+)HLA-DRlow/- myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) were also investigated.
   Results: Results show that IL-35 producing B cells were significantly upregulated during the clinical progression of CRC, and negatively correlated with CD3(+) T cell, positively correlated with the frequency of CD4(+)CD25(+/high)CD127(low/-) Treg cells and CD14(+)HLA-DRlow/ MDSCs of these CRC patients.
   Conclusions: Together, IL-35 producing B cells were significantly elevated in CRC, indicating this B cell subset might participate in the immune suppression of CRC.

AB Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a chronic disorder that slowly worsens and impairs the person's memory, learning, reasoning, judgment, communication and familiar tasks with loss of orientation, AD is characterized clinically by cognitive deficit and pathologically by the deposition of beta amyloid plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, associated with degeneration of the cholinergic forebrain. Withanone (WS-2), a compound isolated from root extract of Withania somnifera at doses administered orally/day to wistar rats for duration of 21 days showed significant improvement in the cognitive skill by inhibiting amyloid beta-42 and attenuated the elevated levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines like TNF alpha, IL-1 beta, IL-6, MCP-1, Nitric oxide, lipid peroxidation and both [3- and y secretase enzymatic activity. Administration of WS-2 also significantly reversed the decline in acetyl choline and Glutathione (GSH) activity. None of the treatments that are available today alter the underlying causes of this terminal disease. Few preliminary clinical treatments have demonstrated that some plant medicines do ameliorate and improve memory and learning in patients with mild-to-moderate AD. WS-2 showed promise in AD treatment because of cognitive benefits and more importantly, mechanisms of action with respect to the fundamental pathophysiology of the disease, not limited to the inhibition of AChE, but also include the modification of A beta processing, protection against oxidative stress and anti-inflammatory effects.

AB Objective: The objective was to describe the efficacy of medical abortion using mifepristone and misoprostol for gestations less than 6 weeks.
   Study design: We searched PubMed and Cochrane databases for articles in any language that examined the success of mifepristone and misoprostol abortion at gestational ages <42 days. Data were independently abstracted by two authors and graded for evidence quality. A pooled analysis of efficacy and a summary odds ratio of abortion failure of <42 days' gestation compared with gestational week 42-49 days were performed for randomized trials as well as for prospective studies.
   Results: Six randomized controlled trials and nine prospective observational studies met inclusion criteria. Included studies varied greatly in regimens of mifepristone and misoprostol used, and assessment of and timing of outcome of abortion. A pooled proportion of the randomized trials estimated a proportion of unsuccessful abortion of 0.02 (95% confidence interval 0.01-0.03). In the prospective studies, the proportions ranged between 0.02 and 0.17, with considerable heterogeneity in the pooled estimate. However, the two largest observational studies reflected the estimates of the randomized trials (range 0.02-0.03). The summary odds ratios indicated that the odds of unsuccessful abortion were not significantly different between gestational age groups (<42 days versus >42-49 days).
   Discussion: These analyses support the use of medical abortion at gestational ages <42 days. Efficacy rates are high overall and appear to reflect those observed during the seventh week of pregnancy. Women who prefer to initiate treatment as soon as early pregnancy is diagnosed may do so without delay. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB Objective: The objective was to learn what complications some women experienced in Madagascar following use of misoprostol for abortion and what treatment they received post misoprostol use.
   Study design: This was a qualitative study in 2015-2016 among women who had experienced complications after use of misoprostol, with or without additional methods, for abortion; what information they received before use; what dosage and regimens they used; what complications they experienced; and what treatment they received postuse. We initially conducted in-depth, semistructured interviews with 60 women who had undergone an abortion that resulted in complications. The results presented here are based on interviews with the subset of 19 women who had used misoprostol.
   Results: The 19 women were aged 16-40, with an average age of 21-26 at interview and average age of 18-21 at abortion. To obtain an abortion, they sought advice from partners, friends, family members, and/or traditional practitioners and health care providers. Misoprostol was easily accessible through the formal and informal sectors, but the dosages and regimens the women used on the advice of others were extremely variable, did not match WHO guidelines and were apparently ineffective, resulting in failed abortion, incomplete abortion, heavy bleeding/hemorrhage, strong pain and/or infection.
   Conclusions: This study provides data on complications from the use of misoprostol as an abortifacient in Madagascar. Health care providers need training in correct misoprostol use and how to treat complications. Law and policy reforms are needed to support such training and to ensure the provision of safe abortion services in the public health system. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

SO CONTRACEPTION

AB Introduction: The lack of economic development and longstanding conflict in Burma have led to mass population displacement. Unintended pregnancy and unsafe abortion are common and contribute to maternal death and disability. In 2011, stakeholders operating along the Thailand-Burma border established a community-based distribution program of misoprostol for early abortion, with the aim of providing safe and free abortion care in this low-resource and legally restricted setting.
   Methods: We conducted 16 in-depth, in-person interviews with women from Burma residing on both sides of the border who accessed misoprostol through the community-based distribution initiative. We analyzed interviews for content and themes using deductive and inductive methods.
   Results: Overall, women felt positively about their abortion experiences and the initiative. Previous abortion experiences and the recommendations of others shaped women's access. All participants, including those who remained pregnant after taking the misoprostol, would recommend the initiative to others.
   Conclusion: Community-based distribution of misoprostol is an effective and culturally appropriate method of improving safe abortion care on the Thailand-Burma border. Supporting efforts to expand the harm reduction program to more communities and provide regular reproductive health and safe abortion trainings appears warranted. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

AB Objectives: This study aimed to document the means women use to obtain abortions in the capital cities of Benin and Burkina Faso, and to learn whether or not use of misoprostol has become an alternative to other methods of abortion, and the implications for future practice.
   Study design: We conducted in-depth, qualitative interviews between 2014 and 2015 with 34 women - 21 women in Cotonou (Benin) and 13 women in Ouagadougou (Burkina Faso) about their pathways to abortion. To obtain a diverse sample in terms of socio-demographic characteristics, we recruited the women through our own knowledge networks, in health facilities where women are treated for unsafe abortion complications, and in schools in Benin.
   Results: The 34 women had had 69 abortions between them. Twenty-five of the women had had 37 abortions in the previous 5 years; the other abortions were 5-20 years before. Pathways to abortion were very different in the two cities. Lengthy and difficult pathways with unsafe methods often led to complications in Ougadougou, whereas most Cotonou women went to small, private health centers. Six of the 37 abortions in the previous 5 years involved misoprostol use, and were all among educated women with significant social and economic capital and personal contact with clinicians.
   Conclusions: Use of misoprostol for abortion has appeared in both Cotonou and Ougadougou in the past 5 years. Evidence that the use of misoprostol for abortion occurred among women with the most access to information and resources in this study suggests that increased awareness of and use of misoprostol in both countries is likely in the coming years.

AB Objectives: To examine the treatment efficacy, safety and satisfaction of women using medical abortion (MA) pills provided by pharmacists following an education intervention based on a harm reduction approach.
   Study design: This was an operations research study over a six-month period in 2015, using a non-inferiority design. We provided training to dispense MA pills, based on a harm reduction approach, to a group of pharmacy workers in Makwanpur district (GROUP 2). We compared selected outcomes with women who bought the pills from pharmacy workers in Chitwan district (GROUP 1), who had received similar training in 2010. The primary endpoint measured in 992 women in both districts was complete abortion within 30 days of using the pills. We assessed the efficacy of MA (self-reported complete abortion) and safety (no reported adverse event). To determine complete abortion, we asked women about passage of the products of conception, cessation of abdominal cramps, vaginal bleeding, need for manual vacuum aspiration or repeated doses of misoprostol. We used a four-point Lickert Scale to determine level of satisfaction with MA use. Pearson Chi-Square test was used to examine any differences in proportion of complete abortions between women who were served by the two groups of pharmacy workers.
   Results: The difference in the rate of complete abortions between the two groups of women, 96.9% and 98.8%, was not statistically significant. The women reported no serious complications, and there was little difference in their satisfaction levels.
   Conclusions: Trained pharmacy workers dispensed MA safely and effectively to the satisfaction of almost all women clients, and the positive results of training had continued several years later. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

AB Objective: The objective was to assess the provision of the combination of mifepristone misoprostol for menstrual regulation (MR) in randomly selected urban pharmacies in Bangladesh.
   Study design: We conducted a cross-sectional survey among 553 pharmacy workers followed by 548 mystery client visits to the same pharmacies in 3 municipal districts during July 2014 December 2015.
   Results: The survey found that 99% of pharmacy workers visited had knowledge of MR procedures but only two-thirds (67%) could state the legal time limit correctly; they mentioned misoprostol (86%) over mifepristone-misoprostol combination (78%) as a procedure of MR with medication (MRM); 36% reported knowing the recommended dosage of mifepristone misoprostol combination; 70% reported providing information on effectiveness of the medicines; 50% reported recommending at least one follow-up visit to them; 63% reported explaining possible complications of using the medications; and 47% reported offering any post-MR contraception to their clients. In contrast, mystery client visits found that the mifepristone misoprostol combination (69%) was suggested over misoprostol (51%) by the pharmacy workers; 54% provided the recommended dosage of mifepristone misoprostol combination; 42% provided information on its effectiveness; 12% recommended at least one follow-up visit; 11% counseled on possible complications; and only 5% offered post-MR contraceptives to the mystery clients.
   Conclusions: We found knowledge gaps regarding recommended dosage for MRM and inconsistent practice in informing women on effectiveness, follow-up visits, possible complications and provision of post-MR contraceptives among the pharmacy workers, particularly during the mystery client visits.

AB Objective: To assess the feasibility of following up women who purchase mifepristone+misoprostol or misoprostol-only from pharmacies in order to measure the safety and effectiveness of self-administration of menstrual regulation.
   Study design: A prospective cohort study followed women purchasing mifepristone+misoprostol or misoprostol-only from pharmacies in Bangladesh. Participants were recruited by pharmacy workers either in person or indirectly via the purchaser of the drugs. End users were contacted by phone 2 weeks after recruitment, screened and interviewed.
   Results: Study recruitment rates by pharmacy workers were low (30%, 109 of 642 women informed about the study), but 2-week follow-up rates were high (87%). Of the 109 end users interviewed, 87 purchased mifepristone+misoprostol and 20 misoprostol-only, while 2 women did not know what drugs they had purchased. Mean self-reported number of weeks of pregnancy was 5.7 weeks. Information provision by pharmacy workers was inadequate (40.4% received none, 8.7% received written information or pictures). A total of 80.5% of mifepristone+misoprostol users were sold the correct regimen versus 9 out of 20 misoprostol-only users. A total of 68.8% did not report experiencing any complications (70.0% misoprostol-only; 69.0% mifepristone+misoprostol users, p=1.0). A total of 94.3% of mifepristone+misoprostol users and 75% of misoprostol-only users reported that they were not pregnant at day 15 (p=.020). However, 7.3% of all users sought additional treatment.
   Conclusions: Challenges in assessing outcomes of self-managed menstrual regulation medications purchased from pharmacies must be overcome through further development of this methodology. Interventions are urgently needed to ensure that women have access to correct dosages, accurate information and necessary referrals. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB Objective: To demonstrate the feasibility and safety of training midlevel healthcare providers (midwives and family nurses) to provide medical abortion and postabortion contraception in underserved areas in Kyrgyzstan.
   Study design: This was an implementation study at four referral facilities and 28-Felsher Obstetric Points in two districts to train their midwives and family nurses to deliver safe and effective abortion care with co-packaged mifepristone misoprostol and provide contraceptives postabortion. The outcome of abortion complete abortion, incomplete abortion or o-going pregnancy was the primary end point measured. An international consultant trained 18 midwives and 14 family nurses (with midwifery diplomas) to provide medical abortion care. Supervising gynecologists based in the referral centers and study investigators based in Bishkek provided monthly monitoring of services and collection of patient management forms. A voluntary self-administered questionnaire at the follow-up visit documented women's acceptability of medical abortion services. All study data were cross-checked and entered into an online data management system for descriptive analysis.
   Results: Between August 2014 and September 2015, midwives provided medical abortion to 554 women with a complete abortion rate of 97.8%, of whom 62% chose to use misoprostol at home. No women were lost to follow-up. Nearly all women (99.5%) chose a contraceptive method postabortion; 61% of women receiving services completed the acceptability form, of whom more than 99% indicated a high level of satisfaction with the service and would recommend it to a friend.
   Conclusion: This study demonstrates that trained Kyrgyz midwives and nurses can provide medical abortion safely and effectively. This locally generated evidence can be used by the Kyrgyz Ministry of Health to reduce unintended pregnancy and expand safe abortion care to women in underserved periurban and rural settings.

AB Objective(s): To estimate the costs of public-sector abortion provision in South Africa and to explore the potential for expanding access at reduced cost by changing the mix of technologies used.
   Study design: We conducted a budget impact analysis using public sector abortion statistics and published cost data. We estimated the total costs to the public health service over 10 years, starting in South Africa's financial year 2016/17, given four scenarios: (1) holding service provision constant, (2) expanding public sector provision, (3) changing the abortion technologies used (i.e. the method mix), and (4) expansion plus changing the method mix.
   Results: The public sector performed an estimated 20% of the expected total number of abortions in 2016/17; 26% and 54% of all abortions were performed illegally or in the private sector respectively. Costs were lowest in scenarios where method mix shifting occurred. Holding the proportion of abortions performed in the public-sector constant, shifting to more cost-effective service provision (more first-trimester services with more medication abortion and using the combined regimen for medical induction in the second trimester) could result in savings of $28.1 million in the public health service over the 10-year period. Expanding public sector provision through elimination of unsafe abortions would require an additional $192.5 million.
   Conclusions: South Africa can provide more safe abortions for less money in the public sector through shifting the methods provided. More research is needed to understand whether the cost of expanding access could be offset by savings from averting costs of managing unsafe abortions. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

AB Chrysanthemum-like sulfur (VI) modified graphite carbon nitride (s/g-C3N4) was synthesized by sulfuring and sonicating bulk g-C3N4 at 800 kHz. The sulfuring relaxed the interlayer force of g-C3N4, and the sonication constructed its chrysanthemum-like structure which enhances the separation of photo-generated carriers and photochemical response. Density functional calculation and diffusion reflection spectra (DRS) verified that sulfur (VI) modification shifted down the valence band edge of g-C3N4 and improved the redox potentials of g-C3N4. The photocatalytic degradation efficiency of 4-nitrophenol (10 mg L-1) by s/g-C3N4 was 49.3 times higher than that by bulk g-C3N4 under visible light irradiation (>400 nm). (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB Extensive investigation on self-assembly of DDAB in aqueous medium is severely restricted due to its insolubility. However, DDAB is highly soluble in acetonitrile, which allows investigation in a wide range of concentrations. An unusual aggregation phenomenon is exhibited by DDAB in acetonitrile, displaying six breaks in conductivity-concentration profile in a wide concentration regime. This study along with that of steady state fluorescence measurements indicate the presence of six-step self-assembly phenomena to occur in the system. HRTEM experiments show the presence of fascinating morphologies of the aggregates. The experimental observations are analyzed and the driving forces behind the phenomena are discussed.

AB Common local and semi-local density functionals poorly describe the molecular physisorption on metal surfaces due to the lack of dispersion interactions. In the last decade, several correction schemes have been proposed to amend this fundamental flaw of Density Functional Theory. Using the prototypical case of aromatic molecules adsorbed on Ag(1 1 1), we discuss the accuracy of different dispersion-correction methods and present a reparameterization strategy for the simple and effective DFT-D2. For the adsorption of different aromatic systems on the same metallic substrate, good results at feasible computational costs are achieved by means of a fitting procedure against MP2 data.

ID FULLERENES; MECHANICS
AB The interaction energy for two adjacent adamantane molecules and that of adamantane molecules encapsulated inside carbon nanotubes are investigated considering only dipole-dipole induced interaction. The Lennard-Jones potential and the continuous approximation are utilised to derive analytical expressions for these interaction energies. The equilibrium distance 3.281 angstrom between two adamantane molecules is determined. The smallest carbon nanotube radius b(0) that can encapsulate the adamantane molecule and the radius of the tube b(max) that gives the maximum suction energy, linearly depend on the adamantane radius, are calculated. For larger diameter tubes, the off axis position has been calculated, and equilibrium distance between molecule and tube wall is found to be close to the interlayer spacing in graphene.

TI Quantum size and magnesium composition effects on the optical absorption
   in the MgxZn(1-x)O/ZnO quantum well
SO CHEMICAL PHYSICS LETTERS
LA English
DT Article
ID IN ELECTRIC-FIELD
AB In this work, we investigated the effects of polarizations and structural parameters on the optical absorption coefficient (OAC) and the intersubband transition between the three lowest energy levels E-1, E-2, and E-3 in the MgxZn(1 x)O/ZnO single quantum well. The energy of the electron in each level and its respective wavefunction are calculated by the numerical solution of Schrodinger and Poisson equations self-consistently using an effective mass approximation. Our findings exhibit that the intersubband transitions, Delta E-12 and Delta E-13, can be altered and controlled by varying the quantum well width and the magnesium composition, x. Moreover, our results suggest that the optical absorption coefficients, alpha(12) and alpha(13), can be modulated principally by adjusting the quantum well width, especially the optical absorption coefficient (alpha(12)), which presents a red shift by raising the quantum well thickness. Contrary to alpha(12), the optical absorption coefficient, alpha(13), can present either a red or a blue shift by increasing the quantum well width. The process responsible for this behavior, which can be suitable for optoelectronic device applications, is discussed here in detail. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The kinetic energy release distributions in unimolecular reactions is calculated with detailed balance theory, taking into account the tunneling and the reflection coefficient in three different types of transition states; (i) a saddle point corresponding to a standard RRKM-type theory, (ii) an attachment Langevin cross section, and (iii) an absorbing sphere potential at short range, without long range interactions. Corrections are significant in the one dimensional saddle point states. Very light and lightly bound absorbing systems will show measurable effects in decays from the absorbing sphere, whereas the Langevin cross section is essentially unchanged. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB Adsorption of NO on Fe3O4(111) is studied by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. NO is preferably adsorbed atop the octahedral site which has a clearly higher adsorption energy than the tetrahedral site. The difference in adsorption energy correlates with differences in adsorption geometries and N-O stretch vibrations. The results are in good agreement with temperature programmed desorption (TPD) and reflection-adsorption IR spectroscopy (RAIRS) measurements and provide an explanation of the observation of only one vibrational mode despite two distinct TPD features.

AB One-dimensional semiclassical transition state theory is applied to study the rate constants of the CH3 + CH4 reaction and its hydrogen-substituted isotopic analogues. This requires calculation of vibrational frequencies at the reactant, product and transition states, and the anharmonic constants of the reaction coordinate at the transition state. The reactions studied have a hindered rotor vibration at the transition states, whose behaviour is approximated using two methods. The results show very good agreement to experimental and other theoretical results. The three reactions studied allow evaluation of both primary and secondary kinetic isotope effects in the title reaction. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In recent years new materials for phosphorescent organic light-emitting diodes were found from complexes of carbazole-modified ortho-phenylene derivatives. We investigate theoretically the photo-induced charge transfer in these complexes. The electronically excited states and absorption spectra of tetramer ortho-phenylene (OP) derivatives were first studied by using time-dependent density functional theory calculations with various functionals. The functional that best reproduced the experimental results was found to be omega B97XD, and the assignment of the experimentally observed ultraviolet-visible absorption spectrum was successfully performed in comparison with the theoretically obtained one. We then performed a spectral assignment of carbazole-modified OP derivatives. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this work the efficacy of semi-classical surface hopping approaches is investigated through studies of the photodissociation dynamics of BrCN and ICN . BrCN provides a challenging situation for semi-classical approaches as excitation to the first bright state yields both Br + CN and Br* + CN products. Further, this branching is highly sensitive to the amount of rotational energy in the CN0/ fragment. The results of semi-classical and quantum mechanical descriptions of the dynamics are compared when the classical dynamics are propagated in an adiabatic and diabatic representation. The implications of the differences between the classical and quantum treatments of J = 0 are also explored. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The presence of oxygen isotopic anomaly in hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) has been established by measurements of three oxygen isotopes (O-16, O-17, O-18) in H2O2 from experiments on H2O2 formation using a water vapour discharge in presence of (O-2, CO2, Ar) gases and using VUV photolysis of water vapour. The termolecular OH recombination reaction may be account for the source of MIF in H2O2 due to a selective isotopic enrichment through the radical pair mechanism with non-equivalent nuclei. It was established that the magnitude of the observed MIF signals in H2O2 depended on the presence of oxidising gases. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The proposed grafting polymerization of gamma-methacryloxypropyltrimethoxy silane was performed to functionalize graphene, aiming to fabricate functionalized graphene/silicone with excellent thermal conductivities. The surface morphology and element content of poly(gamma-methacryloxypropyltrimethoxy silane) grafted reduced graphene oxide (g-RGO) was characterized by Atomic force microscope (AFM) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The usage of g-RGO was benefit for improving the thermal conductivity of silicone (SI). The g-RGO/SI (2 wt% filler) had thermal conductivity of 1.31 W.m (1).K (1) and thermal diffusivity of 1.08 mm(2).s (1) (increased by 620% compared to that of SI), which held potential for electronic packaging materials and micro-electro-mechanical systems apparatus.

AB DNA duplexes consisting of a 25mer together with shorter complementary sequences were studied over a range of temperature and surface binding motifs using a coarse-grained two-site nucleotide model. Results were analyzed in terms of hydrogen bonding interactions and structural characteristics and indicate that hybridization is most stable when furthest from the surface binding site. Strand elongation and straightening near the bound end are found to be correlated to duplex destabilization. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In the present study, a single crystal of a Schiff base, 2,2'(hydrazine-1,2-diylidenebis(propan-1-yl-1-ylidene)) diphenol, was synthesized. The structure of the synthesized crystal was confirmed by H-1 and C-13 NMR spectroscopic and X-ray diffraction analysis techniques. Experimental and theoretical studies were carried out on two tautomeric structures. It has been observed that the title compound studied can be in two different tautomeric forms, phenol-imine and keto-amine. Theoretical calculations have been performed to support experimental results. Accordingly, the geometric parameters of the compound were optimized by the density functional theory (DFT) method using the Gaussian 09 and Quantum Espresso (QE) packet program was used for periodic boundary conditions (PBC) studies. Furthermore, the compound was also tested for in vitro antifungal activity against Sclerotinia sclerotiorum, Alternaria solani, Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. lycopersici and Monilinia fructigena plant pathogens. Promising inhibition profiles were observed especially towards A. solani. Finally, molecular docking studies and post-docking procedure based on Molecular Mechanics-Generalized Born Surface Area (MM-GBSA) were also carried out to get insight into the compound's binding interactions with the potential. Although theoretical calculations showed that the phenol-imine form was more stable, keto-amine form was predicted to have better binding affinity which was concluded to result from loss of rotational entropy in phenol-imine upon binding. The results obtained here from both experimental and computational methods might serve as a potential lead in the development of novel anti-fungal agents. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this study, we apply an advanced floating catalyst method to fabricate carbon nanotube (CNT) aerogels at super high deposition rate for oil spill cleaning. The aerogels consist of 3D porous network of stacking double-walled CNT bundles with low catalyst impurity (9%) and high thermal stability (650 degrees C). With high porosity, surface areas, and water contact angles, the CNT aerogels exhibit a high oil adsorption of up to 107 g/g and good reusability of up to four adsorption-burning cycles. This work suggests that the lightweight, porous, and super hydrophobic CNT aerogels can be promising sorbent materials for environmental applications. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In order to fit potential energy surface (PES) of gold nanoclusters, we have integrated bispectrum features with artificial neural network (ANN) learning technique in this work. We have also devised an algorithm for selecting the frequencies that need to be coupled for extracting the phase information between different frequency bands. We have found that higher order invariant like bispectrum is highly efficient in exploring the PES as compared to other invariants. The sensitivity of bispectrum can also be exploited in acting as an order parameter for calculating many thermodynamic properties of nanoclusters. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The nucleation process of a nanoparticle requires an environment that stabilizes the initial seed and favors the growth action. In this paper, we present a specific design of growing points for silver nanoparticles based on the well-known affinity of the silver to the chlorine atoms and to aromatic groups by cation-pi interactions. [2-(vinylphenyl) ethyl] chloromethylphenylsilane was proposed as growing point of nanoparticles, which has been synthetized and grafted on a polypropylene membrane. Nanoparticles were synthesized by chemically reducing an AgNO3 solution with NaBH4 and the so synthesized nanoparticles were also fully characterized. Using DFT-QTAIM calculations a model of the initial seed and a growth mechanism were proposed. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The microenvironment at the surface of hen-egg-white lysozyme (HEWL) was examined by analyzing the change in pK(a) of fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) upon binding to the N-terminus of HEWL. The result showed that the local pH at the HEWL surface is higher than the bulk pH. Furthermore, the data showed that the difference between the local and bulk pH becomes larger with decreasing pH, suggesting HEWL repels more protons at lower pH. Because the local pH affects the protonation states of functional amino-acids at the protein surface, the results provide the fundamental insight into the microenvironment at the protein surface.

AB In this work ZnO/ZnSe composites were successfully synthesized via solvothermal method and characterized by a series of experiments for investigating into their compositions, morphologies, microstructures and the activities of photocatalytic reduction of CO2. The methanol rates of bare ZnO and ZnSe respectively were 763.9 mu mol/g(cat)/h and 503.88 mu mol/g(cat)/h. However, the sample of 3 wt% ZnO/ZnSe performed better photocatalytic activity up 1581.82 mu mol/g(cat)/h compared to bare ZnO and ZnSe. In the as-prepared photocatalyst the nanosheet of ZnSe benefited the light harvest; suitable deposition of ZnO on the ZnSe nanosheet constructed a type II heterojunction for transferring the photo-generated electron to reduce CO2.

The block copolymer, prepared by Atom-Transfer Radical Polymerization (ATRP), was used as a nanoreactor for iron oxide NPs. The NPs were embedded in poly(hydroxypropyl methacrylate)-block-poly(N-phenylmaleimide) matrix. The following topographical modifications of the surface of the film were specially analyzed: control of pore features and changes in surface roughness. Finally, the NPs functionality inside the polymer matrix and how it may affect the thermal and optical properties of the films were assessed. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB We investigated the charge-transfer reactions of solar cells including a quaterthiophene copolymer with naphtho-bis-thiadiazole (PNTz4T) and naphtho-bis-oxadiazole (PNOz4T) using constrained density functional theory (CDFT). According to our calculations, the high electron-transfer rate results in a highly efficient solar cell, and the stable charge-transfer state results in low energy loss. Our computations imply that the following three factors are crucial to improve the performance of semiconducting polymers: (i) large structural changes following charge-transfer, (ii) narrow band gap, and (iii) spatially delocalized lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of the ground state.

AB Liesegang patterns of silver dichromate (Ag2Cr2O7) are studied in two different gel media: agar and gelatin, based on the work of Lagzi and Ueyama (2009). Whereas in gelatin, standard Liesegang bands are obtained as a result of the interdiffusion of Ag+ and Cr2O72- random crystallites with dendritic ramifications are observed in agar. We revisit this phenomenon and demonstrate the proposed mechanism, wherein dense heterogeneous nucleation in gelatin leads to Liesegang bands, as opposed to surface nucleation in agar yielding crystallites. We use viscosity, pH measurements, and notably scanning electron microscopy (SEM) in this endeavor. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The CCSD(T)/CBS benchmarks of interaction energy are reported. It is found that RPA agrees well with CCSD(T)/CBS benchmarks and experimental results. CCSD(T) and QCISD(T) perform the best only when compared with CCSD(T)/CBS benchmarks, MP2 performs well only for experimental data. B3LYP provides the worst accuracy.

AB Monte Carlo track chemistry simulations of the B-10(n, alpha)Li-7 radiolysis of water show that the in situ formation of H3O+ by the two He and Li recoiling ions renders the native track regions temporarily very acidic. For these irradiating ions, the pH remains near 0 at times less than similar to 100 ps after which the system gradually returns to neutral pH at similar to 0.1 ms. These 'acid spikes' have never been invoked in water or in a cellular environment exposed to densely ionizing radiations. The question of their implications in boron neutron capture therapy and, more generally, in hadrontherapy, is discussed briefly. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Xanthene dyes have wide ranging applications as fluorescent probes in analytical, biochemical and medical contexts. Being cationic/anionic in nature, the solvation dynamics of xanthene dyes confined within a negatively/positively charged interface are very interesting. Unfortunately, the floppy structure and small Stokes shift render any xanthene dye unsuitable for use as a solvation probe. Using di-sodium fluorescein, we present our work on the picosecond solvation dynamics of bulk and confined water (at pH = 9.2). We also propose a new methodology for studying picosecond solvation dynamics using any fluorescent dye with a small Stokes shift. We discuss how scattering contributions can be effectively removed, and propose an alternative way of defining zero time of solvation. Finally, we demonstrate the tuning location of the probe within confinement. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Understanding how the hydrological regime in relation to sediment type interferes with ecosystem development is important when wetlands are created with soft muddy material. Especially when plants are used as ecological engineers to promote crest stability and soil formation. We carried out a two-year mesocosm experiment with sediments derived from the Dutch lake Markermeer to identify the effects of the hydrological regime and sediment type on ecosystem functioning in terms of nutrient availability. We measured plant productivity, plant nutrient stoichiometry, and concentrations of N, P, and K in shoots and roots of Phragmites australis and Rumex maritimus and monitored how the clay-rich sediment from lake Markermeer changed into a wetland soil. Plants grown on Markermeer sediments tend to be N limited when periodically inundated and P limited when not inundated at all. The P availability was determined by the hydrological regime, while the N availability was determined by both the hydrological regime and the sediment type. Ecosystem development on created wetlands can be manipulated by adequate management of the hydrological regime, as plant species respond differently to changes in nutrient availability. This should be considered in eco-engineering projects where plants are used as ecological engineers to fasten ecosystem development on wetlands that are to be created from clay-rich material.

AB Tree-less peatland communities can subject to vegetative succession, which often progresses toward a recovery of woodland or forest dominated by Salix, Betula or Alnus glutinosa. Since this process provides a threat to already established combinations of species and habitats of nature conservation value, there is a need to elaborate an efficient and environmentally friendly method of managing invading species. We investigated the effectiveness of removing invading black alder, Alnus glutinosa (similar to 18 years old; up to 4 m tall), from a non-forest mire by applying a single cut. We tested whether alder removal was positively related to the height of the cut and the season of the year. Most mortality occurred in the first year after the cut. Three years later, the response to cutting showed a moderate increase in dead trees, especially among trees that had been cut in autumn. Stump height significantly affected tree mortality. A cut at breast height eliminated 22% of the trees, a cut 5-10 cm above the ground at the base of the trunk eliminated 36%, and a cut at or just below the ground surface eliminated 100%. The success of this Alnus elimination method is likely to depend on a combination of mechanical treatment and shallow inundation. Otherwise, Alnus removal will require additional measures, including herbicide treatment.

DE Total phosphorus removal; Ammonium removal; Constructed wetlands;
   Dynamic diffusion-dominated root layer model
ID FLOW CONSTRUCTED WETLANDS; DESIGN; PROJECT
AB This paper presents two powerful and productive models, called VART-TP model and VART-NH4 model, for simulating the removal processes of total phosphorus (TP) and ammonium (NH4+), respectively, in constructed wetlands with free water surface (FWS). A distinctive feature of the models is the incorporation of a dynamic diffusion-dominated root-zone. The VART-TP model was tested with data collected from four small test cells of constructed wetlands (TCW) planted with submerged aquatic vegetations in south Florida, USA. The test cells were divided into two groups with the north test cells (N1 & N15) receiving an average phosphorus (TP) concentration of 71 mu g/l and the south test cells receiving an average TP concentration of 27 mu g/l. Testing results showed that root mean square error (RMSE) of the VART-TP model varied in the range of 4.45-17.50 mu g TP/l., respectively, for north test cells while the RMSE ranged between 3.58-7.63 mu g TP/l for south test cells. The result suggested that (1) the N1 and N15 test cells receiving high TP concentrations are capable of removing TP with high efficiency and (2) the VART-TP model is capable of simulating the removal processes of TP. The VART-NH4 model was tested with data collected from Lake Manzala Engineered Wetland (LMEW), Egypt, which generally received the influent of high ammonia concentration (average= 2.26 mg NH4/l). The testing results showed that the NH4+ concentrations simulated with the VART-NH4 model were in reasonable agreement with those monitored at the wetland outlet, as indicated with the RMSE of 0.06 mg/l. The results demonstrated that the VART-TP and VART-NH4 models are reliable and efficient modeling tools for designing constructed wetlands.

AB The presence of recalcitrant cytotoxic drugs in aquatic environments pose significant harmful effects to the ecosystems and human health. Due to the problems associated with physicochemical methods in treatment of effluents containing cytotoxic agents, the present study aimed to evaluate the efficiency of microalgae in bioremediation of these compounds. Biosorption of the anticancer drug, Flutamide (FLU), was performed by living and dead biomass of Chlorella vulgaris. The living microalga showed a better performance in the drug removal considering the amount of biomass, pH and time of adsorption. A nonlinear regression approach revealed that the Freundlich and Langmuir isotherms could fit well to the adsorption data. Maximum sorption capacity of the living microalga (26.8 mg g(-1)) was higher than the dead biomass (12.5 mg g(-1)). Kinetic studies showed that adsorption process by living and dead microalga followed the modified Freundlich model. Optimization of the process by response surface methodology (RSM) indicated that at FLU concentration of 50 mu M, pH 7.4 and 10 min, 98.5% drug removal could be obtained by the living biomass. The results indicate that the use of microalga can be a promising technology for the treatment of wastewaters containing cytotoxic compounds.

AB This research describes a geomorphic-based process of mining reclamation carried out at the El Machorro mine (at the edge of the Alto Tajo Natural Park, East Central Spain) and its monitoring for five years (2012-2017). The GeoFluv T method implemented by the Natural Regrade software has been used to design small watersheds as a mining reclamation topographical solution. The procedure included: (i) finding a suitable reference area with stable landforms and acquiring inputs from them; (ii) designing two first-order stream watersheds; (iii) building the planned landscape; and (iv) monitoring the hydrological and erosive -sedimentary response of the reclaimed watersheds. This process is in itself a contribution to global advancement of reclamation best practices, because there are very few geomorphic-based mining reclamation examples, and even fewer that include their multiannual monitoring. Sediment yields were obtained comparing Digital Elevation Models (DEM) acquired by Total Station (TS), Terrestrial Laser Scanning (TLS), differential Global Positioning System (GPS) and topographic reconstructions (interpretations). An H-flume with turbidity and water pressure sensors allowed quantifying runoff and suspended sediment. Sediment yield progressively decreased with time attaining a current low value (4.02 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1)). Water discharge and suspended sediment concentration have also decreased with time.
   Initially, high sediment yield values were obtained. They are interpreted as being triggered by grading errors that deviated from the design, so that runoff adjusted construction irregularities during that period by erosion and sedimentation. After those adjustments, the reclamation surface became more reflective of the design and the resulting surface remained very 'stable'. The deduction is that the geomorphic-based reclamation has re-established an approximate steady-state or dynamic equilibrium, where hydrological and erosive -sedimentary functionality operate now at rates comparable to the surrounding natural land. Although further research is required to confirm long-term stability, geomorphic reclamation appears as an efficient mining reclamation alternative solution to the traditional approach of gradient terraces and downdrains, which require frequent and costly maintenance, in the highly erodible setting of the Alto Tajo Natural Park surroundings, as well as in most open pit mines.

AB Green roofs, especially productive ones (e.g. of edible biomass), are urban ecosystems developed in response to the scarcity of arable areas in urban environments. Their installation is also perceived as a possible way to preserve biodiversity in cities. However, the effectiveness of green roofs in supporting biodiversity, especially soil biodiversity, has rarely been studied. In order to orient the ecological engineering of green roofs, it is crucial to understand the resulting biodiversity patterns. We hypothesised that a functional trait-based approach could be used to investigate different ways of colonisation. We investigated collembolan communities in both extensive and productive green roofs. Surprisingly, no difference was observed in either taxonomic or functional structures of collembolan diversity between extensive and productive green roofs. Conversely, according to the functional composition, two ways of colonisation are suggested: a passive wind dispersal - the "flying" collembolans - and a settlement through compost inputs. We conclude that stakeholders should take into account the spatial connections of green roofs with other green spaces in order to support soil biodiversity. Further studies are needed to more accurately elucidate the importance of green roof types for collembolan communities and associated ecological networks.

AB Plant survival and growth are essential parameters in monitoring the effectiveness of phytoremediation protocols for brownfields decontamination. The ability of different willow cultivars to survive and adapt to contamination in polluted soils can vary according to the nature and concentration of the contaminants. The objectives of this study were to identify which cultivars had the highest yields, and to determine whether the origin of the cuttings influences survival, growth and phytoextraction potential of willow cultivars when grown on polluted soil. Survival, growth and phytoextraction of trace elements (Cd, Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb, Zn) were compared for ten willow cultivars planted in a highly organic-contaminated industrial environment versus in uncontaminated soil. Variations in cultivar response according to cutting origin (contaminated site or not) were also analysed for each site. Results show that, Salix nigra '5005' was very productive in an extremely contaminated environment. Salix eriocephala 'S25' also performed exceptionally well, as it produced large root biomass (nearly twice that the other cultivars). The highest concentration of cadmium was found in S. x dasyclados 'SV1'; cultivars S. purpurea x S. miyabeana 'Millbrook' and S. eriocephala 'S25' exhibited the highest concentrations of chromium. Cultivar 'S25' was also the most effective at concentrating copper, and S. miyabeana 'SX67' was the most efficient at phytoextracting zinc. The origin of the cuttings did not have a significant influence on survival, growth or phytoextraction, except for 'Millbrook' : individuals originating from the contaminated environment produced significantly more aboveground biomass when grown in a contaminated environment, compared to individuals who had never been in contact with contaminants. These results could help build more effective phytoremediation protocols for highly contaminated environments by identifying willow cultivars and cutting selection techniques appropriate for specific environments.

TI Stormwater infiltration capacity of street tree pits: Quantifying the
   influence of different design and management strategies in New York City
SO ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING
LA English
DT Article
AB Street trees are abundant in the urban landscape and provide many ecosystem services including stormwater management. For trees housed within tree pits, the ability to mitigate stormwater runoff can be modulated by the permeability of the soil within the tree pit itself. Thus, developing a better understanding of how tree pit design and management impact soil permeability can be important to quantifying, and potentially improving, the stormwater benefits of street trees. To this end, water infiltration rate was measured at forty tree pits representing the variety of physical conditions commonly seen in New York City, including the presence or absence of a tree pit guard, the size of the tree pit, the size of the tree, the presence or absence of ground cover planting, the presence or absence of mulch, and the elevation of the pit's soil surface relative to the sidewalk. An initial analysis of results first tested the impact of each physical condition on infiltration rate individually. Genetic programming was then used to investigate interactive effects between the physical conditions, and to develop a statistical model that captured 66% of the variability in the observed infiltration rate using simple physical features of a tree pit. Results showed that the most significant factor influencing the infiltration rate was the presence of a guard around a tree pit, with guarded tree pits having higher infiltration rates. Additionally, higher infiltration rates in guarded pits were associated with larger pit areas, built-up surface elevations (binary) and the combined presence of ground cover planting (binary) and mulch (binary). Tree size, as measured by circumference at breast height, was found to be a less significant indicator of the infiltration rate. The statistical model, together with the study measurements, can be used to estimate the stormwater benefits of different tree pit management strategies, inform designs for improved stormwater management, and help identify useful observations or measurements for a street tree census.

TI Transport equations in an enzymatic glucose fuel cell
SO CHEMICAL PHYSICS LETTERS

DT Article
DE Glucose; Convection; Fuel cell; Hydrogen; Diffusion; Temperature
AB A mathematical model is developed to study the effects of convective flux and operating temperature on the performance of an enzymatic glucose fuel cell with a membrane. The model assumes isothermal operating conditions and constant feed rate of glucose. The glucose fuel cell domain is divided into five sections, with governing equations describing transport characteristics in each region, namely - anode diffusion layer, anode catalyst layer (enzyme layer), membrane, cathode catalyst layer and cathode diffusion layer. The mass transport is assumed to be one-dimensional and the governing equations are solved numerically. The effects flow rate of glucose feed on the performance of the fuel cell are studied as it contributes significantly to the convective flux. The effects of operating temperature on the performance of a glucose fuel cell are also modeled. The cell performances are compared using cell polarization curves, which were found compliant with experimental observations. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Nanowires (NWs) of GaAs and InGaAs/GaAs axial heterostructure are fabricated by metal-organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) following the vapor-liquid-solid (VLS) mechanism. Thin film of Au is coated to generate catalytic droplets and the impact of film thickness on distribution of catalytic droplets is studied. With growth temperature varying, different geometries of GaAs NWs are observed and an assumption has been proposed to explain the phenomenon. InGaAs/GaAs NWs with axial heterostructures are synthesized. Most of InGaAs/GaAs NWs are perpendicular to substrates with cylindrical morphology and distinct heterostructure interface. Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (EDX) line-scan's been applied to investigate the concentration changes of nanowires, indicating pure axial heterostructures without radial growth.

AB ZnO nanowires with hexagonal wurtzite structure were grown on the glass substrate using Successive Ionic Layer Adsorption and Reaction (SILAR) method. Both experimental and theoretical studies demonstrated that NH3 chemisorbed and transferred the charge to the surface of the nanowire via its nitrogen site to the zinc site of ZnO nanowires, leading to the detection of NH3 vapour. The adsorbed ammonia dissociated into NH2 and H due to steric repulsion, and then into N-2 and H-2 gas. The formation of the N-2 gas during the desorption process confirmed by observing peak at 14 and 28 m/z in the GC-MS spectrum. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Our results show that only the discrete version of this entropy in the interval 0.0 < q < 2.0 gives a consistent behavior with respect to the electron correlation effects of the systems, while the continuous expression in some cases presents negative values, and in general decreases when the correlation effects increase.

AB We have systematically investigated the electronic structures and magnetic properties of nonmetal doped MoSe2 monolayer by using spin-polarized density functional theory calculations. Formation energies reveal that all doped systems are thermodynamically preferred under Mo-rich conditions than Se-rich conditions, and the incorporation of O atom into MoSe2 monolayer is most favorable. Electronic structure analysis elucidates that Cl, Br and I doped systems exhibit half-metallic properties, while the band gap has been significantly tuned by H, B, C, N, and F doping. More importantly, H, B, N, F, Cl, Br, and I doping can induce pronounced magnetic moments in host MoSe2 monolayer. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Using density functional calculations, we study atomic and electronic structures of monolayer hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) and vertical graphene/h-BN heterostructures with substitutional carbon defects. For monolayer h-BN, a carbon atom substituted for a boron or nitrogen atom causes spin polarization. In the presence of an adjacent graphene sheet, however, the spin magnetic moment disappears owing to interlayer charge transfer for a C-B defect. Interestingly, two carbon defects in a hexagon of monolayer h-BN do not induce magnetic properties. In contrast, two C-B defects (two C-N defects) can have spin polarization in the vertical graphene/h-BN heterostructures because of interlayer charge transfer. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

The reaction rate constants calculated by UCCSD(T) energies and UM062X frequencies, agreed well with the experimental observation. This agreement could support the proposed reaction pathway for H-abstraction from amine as an initial step. The high rate constant for the reaction of trimethyl amine with O-3 could be explained by a formation of the cyclic transition state structure. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB We studied the structures and electronic spectra of two periodic GBs in graphene on highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG) surface by using scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy (STM/S). It was found that a GB consisting of triple anti-parallel dislocation arrays of pentagonal-heptagonal (5-7) carbon rings induced an enhanced localized state above the Dirac point, which was attributed to van Hove singularities (VHSs). The localized state was site dependent with the variation between 0.47 and 0.36 eV. Another periodic GB with a symmetric zigzag structure presented VHSs at -0.038 and 0.12 eV near the Fermi level. Moreover, intervalley scattering was observed on GBs. This finding further suggested that defect engineering might tune the electronic structures of graphene and even the performance of graphene-based electronic devices by properly mediating and designing ordered GBs in a graphene layer.

AB In the present work, model M center dot center dot center dot NH3 complexes of alkali and alkaline earth metals are considered to calculate second hyperpolarizability using HF, MP2, CCSD and DFT methods. The diffuse electrons of alkali metals are more efficient than diffuse electron pair of alkaline earth metals in enhancing the magnitude of second hyperpolarizability. The radiation frequency has a dramatic effect on gamma(av). Although MP2 gamma(zzzz) is overestimated by a smaller margin the corresponding gamma(av) fairly agrees with the CCSD result. The large second hyperpolarizability of alkali metal (versus alkaline earth metal) complexes arises from the lower energy intense transition. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Here we report, the preparation of carbon dots showing dual band emission through hydrothermal method. These carbon dots emit 382 nm and 538 nm wavelengths, at 320 nm and 420 nm excitations respectively. However, under 365 nm excitation, these carbon dots show well-resolved emission peaks at 435 nm and 538 nm. The emission peak at 435 nm show excitation wavelength dependence, while the emission peak at 538 nm is independent of the excitation wavelength. The 538 nm emission wavelength in these carbon dots is due to the formation of molecular states containing double bonded oxygen functional groups (C=O and COOH) on the carbon dots surface. The blue emission is due to the various surface state containing both single and double bonded oxygen functional groups on the carbon dots surface. The competition among different emission centers and non-radiative traps due the various functional groups contribute to the fluorescent properties of carbon dots. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Ultrafast dynamics of coupling interactions inside these hybrid structures are carefully examined at 532 nm, which can well interpret the apllication of plasmon-exciton coupling for the co-driven chemical reactions excited at 532 nm.

This prepared nanocomposite showed good catalytic activity in the oxidation of various alcohols to aldehyde and ketone under irradiation of visible light. Various spectroscopic techniques including UV-Visible absorption spectral studies and photoluminescence study are employed to characterize the catalyst. It was also characterized by XRD, TEM, BET, XPS and ICP-AES analysis. In contrast to air and H2O2, use of TBHP as oxidant gave good yield. The reaction conditions with respect to solvent and amount of catalyst are optimized. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Modified spherical complex optical potential method developed by our group is employed for the present calculations for an extensive energy range from positronium formation threshold to 5 keV. Furthermore, a modified absorption threshold is introduced, which is utilized for targets having ionization threshold <6.8 eV. Comparison with existing data shows overall good agreement. Due to limited cross section studies on present targets, most of the results presented in this article have been reported for the first time. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Porous matrix of polyaniline (PANI) has been electrodeposited along with the entrapment of biocompatible redox mediator ferritin (Frt) and glucose oxidase (GOx) on the surface of glassy carbon (GC) electrode. The characterizations have been carried out by X-ray Diffraction (XRD) and Transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The enhanced electrochemical signal transfer rate from enzyme to the electrode surface was due to the intimate contact of the enzyme with the electrochemically polymerized conducting PANI matrix. The PANI/Frt/GOx modified GC bioanode was used to investigate the electrocatalytic activity as a function of the concentration of glucose in the range of 10-60 mM. It was confirmed by the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), the thick deposition of PANI layer becomes more compact due to which the charge transfer resistance of PANI matrix becomes higher. All the electrochemical measurements of the electrode were carried out by using cyclic voltammetry (CV) and linear sweep voltammetry (LSV). CV curves were recorded at different scan rates (20-100 mV/s) at 50 mM of glucose in 0.3 M potassium ferrocyanide. A normalized saturation current density of 22.3 +/- 2 mA/cm(2) was observed for the oxidation of 50 mM glucose at a scan rate of 100 mV/s. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Considering the fact that the efficiency of the uridine-5-methyl radical in producing cytotoxic DNA intrastrand cross-link lesions is greatly higher than that of the uridine-5-yl radical, the radiosensitizing action of 5-(halomethyl) uridines (5-XCH2U, X = F, Cl, or Br) is studied in the present work. It is found that 5-XCH2U has sufficient electron affinity to capture a pre-hydrated or a hydrated electron, and electron attachment leads to significantly facile X - elimination forming the uridine-5-methyl radical. All these three halogenated uridine derivatives are shown to be potential radiosensitizers, with their radiosensitizing abilities increased in an order 5-FCH2U < 5-ClCH2U approximate to 5-BrCH2U.

The subbands, (C) over tilde (2)Pi(3/2) - (X) over tilde (2) Sigma(+) and (C) over tilde (2)Pi(1/2) - (X) over tilde (2) Sigma(+) were rotationally analyzed. Local perturbations were observed in f-parity levels of both spin components of the (C) over tilde state which suggests presence of two (2)Sigma(+/) perturber states. Dispersed fluorescence (DF) from the (C) over tilde (2)Pi state suggests vibronic coupling in the (C) over tilde state to a nearby (2)Sigma(+) state. A low-lying (A) over tilde '(2)Delta(r) electronic state was identified in the DF spectra with the Omega = 5/ 2 and 3/ 2 components lying respectively at 8353 and 7648 cm(-1). (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB Large-area ZnO/Cu2O heterojunction have been successfully synthesized on Cu foil through a simple two-step solution method at near room temperature. The field emission scanning electron microscopy characterization indicates that the morphology of as-prepared Cu2O film grown on Cu foil is octahedral structure with diameter of similar to 450 nm and ZnO is nanorod arrays structure with diameter of similar to 150 nm. The current-voltage measurement of ZnO/Cu2O heterojunction shows a typical rectifying characteristics. Moreover, the photocatalytic test indicates that ZnO/Cu2O heterojunction exhibits high photocatalytic efficient for degradation of congo red dyes. The possible photocatalytic mechanism of ZnO/Cu2O heterojunction is also presented. (C) 2017 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

AB A series of novel poly(acrylic acid)-based polymer electrolytes with high conductivities at room temperature has been prepared and studied. Polymer electrolytes composed of poly(acrylic acid) (PAA) and lithium tetrafluoroborate (LiBF4) were prepared by means of solution casting. The effect of the addition of LiBF4 on the properties of the PAA-based electrolyte matrices was analysed and investigated using impedance spectroscopy. The optimized PAA-based solid electrolyte showed an electrochemical stability window of 3.2 V. Thermogravimetric analysis indicated that the incorporation of LiBF4 into PAA matrix enhances the thermal stability. The structural properties of polymer electrolytes were studied by using X-ray diffraction analysis. (C) 2017 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

AB The practical application of superhydrophobic coatings on glass is usually restricted by their poor wear resistance due to the insufficient adhesion. A double-silica-layered structure was proposed to reinforce the coating adhesion on glass substrate. The wettability, surface morphologies, and chemical composition were investigated by water contact angle measurement, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and fourier transformed infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. The prepared superhydrophobic coating displays a good wear-resistance by emery paper and sand abrasion, which also has excellent thermal stability and UV resistance. This strategy shows a bright future for durable superhydrophobic coating on glass. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The thermal stability of gold nanodumbbells (NDs) is studied in aqueous solution of ionic surfactants. It is found in aqueous solution of cetyltrimethylammonium bromide that the blue-shift of longitudinal surface plasmon resonance band of gold NDs occurs at 75 degrees C and the new gold nanorods (NRs) with shortened aspect ratio are formed at the same time. The aspect ratio of the generated gold NRs gradually decreases and finally approaches similar to 1.7 after repeated processing. Similarly, the same results are also obtained in aqueous solution of sodium dodecyl sulfate at room temperature. Mechanism is proposed for the shape transformation of gold NDs. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB The mesoscopic perovskite solar cells (M-PSCs) were synthesized with MAPbI(3) perovskite layers as light harvesters, which were grown with one-step and two-step solution process, respectively. A comparative study was performed through the quantitative correlation of resulting device performance and the crystalline quality of perovskite layers. Comparing with the one-step counterpart, a pronounced improvement in the steady-state power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) by 56.86% was achieved with two-step process, which was mainly resulted from the significant enhancement in fill factor (FF) from 48% to 77% without sacrificing the open circuit voltage (V-oc) and short circuit current (J(sc)). The enhanced FF was attributed to the reduced non-radiative recombination channels due to the better crystalline quality and larger grain size with the two-step processed perovskite layer. Moreover, the superiority of two-step over one-step process was demonstrated with rather good reproducibility. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB We present an explicit representation of molar entropy for gaseous substances. Fortunately, through comparison of theoretical and experimental results, we discover that the molar entropies can be successfully predicted by applying experimental values of only four molecular constants for the carbon monoxide, hydrogen chloride, hydrogen fluoride, deuterium fluoride, gaseous boron monobromide, and nitrogen monoxide. The present entropy calculation scheme provides opportunities for predicting successfully entropy values of other gaseous substances with no use of a large number of experimental spectroscopy data.

AB Understanding interactions between nanoparticles and small molecules is of significance for design of nanoparticle-based materials. Each citrate-coated silver nanoparticle (AgNP, 24 nm) in solution attracts 210,000 rhodamine 6G (R6G) molecules to assemble on its surface to form 170 nm "micelle-like" structures, where the fluorescence of the R6G molecules is efficiently quenched. The "micelles" can form agglomerates of 370 nm at higher concentrations. The R6G-AgNP self-assembly does not occur at higher R6G concentrations (>= 5 mu M) or can be prevented if AgNP is coated with polymers such as polyethylene glycol or polyvinyl pyrrolidone.

AB Strongly confined and intense optical fields within the plasmonic metal nanocavities show outstanding potential for a wide range of functionalities in nanophotonics. Using time dependent density functional theory calculations, we investigate the optical response evolution as a function of the gap separation distances in nanorod-on-film systems comprised of a nanorod (NR) made of Al or Na on top of an Al film. Huge optical field modulations emerged in the chemically distinct Na NR - Al film system in comparison to the Al NR - Al film system, indicating the vital role of metals involved. We further study the optical response modifications by placing a conducting molecule in the gap region, finding strong spectral modulations via through-molecule electron tunneling.

AB Ag-SrTiFxO1-x nanocomposites (Ag-STFO) were prepared via one-pot solvothermal method and exhibited outstanding photocatalytic performance for degrading the Rhodamine B (RHB). Especially, 0.5 wt% Ag-STFO showed the best degradation rate of 95.7% under simulated solar light irradiation for 3 h. It was found that efficient photocatalytic efficiency is mainly attributed to the synergistic effect of Ag nanoparticles and F ions. Especially, the presence of F ions not only changed the band structure but also changed the morphology (exposed more high-energy crystal face) for SrTiO3. Moreover, the synergistic effect could effectively suppress the recombination of photo-generated electron/hole pairs for substantively enhancing the photocatalytic performance. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB We use time dependent density functional theory to study the electronic and optical properties of rectangular graphene nanoflakes with mixed armchair and zigzag edges under uniaxial strain in order to determine the role of the size and aspect ratio. Both the HOMO-LUMO and optical bandgaps are found to exhibit strong variations under uniaxial strain, unlike two-dimensional graphene. A specific 140-atom nanoflake even is subject to a transition in the energetical order of the HOMO-1 and HOMO wavefunctions. The present work shows that through rational modifications in the aspect ratio and uniaxial strain, the electronic and optical properties of graphene nanoflakes can be favourably tuned.

AB Optical free induction decay (FID) signals of the CH3F v(4) band were observed by using a cw-OPO infrared laser coupled with a Stark switching method. The observed signals have been Fourier transformed to obtain the Lorentz functions and the widths have been analyzed to determine the pressure-broadening coefficients for R-r(0,0), (r)Q(1,0), R-r(1,0), R-r(1,1), and P-p(2,1) to be 1/(pi T-2 p) = (46.1 +/- 2.1), (31.6 +/- 3.6), (21.8 +/- 2.5), (25.2 +/- 4.0), and (26.5 +/- 1.8) MHz/Torr, where T-2 is the transverse decay time. The value of rR(0,0) is larger than that determined from a recent pressure-broadening measurement by 39 +/- 12%. The difference is explained by collision induced reorienting transitions (Delta M = +/- 1, Delta J = 0). (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The present paper reports results from a theoretical analysis of the host/guest inclusion process involving two Biginelli adducts urease inhibitors into the p-sulfonic acid calix[4,6] arenes. Structure and stabilization energies, were calculated, in aqueous phase, and in 1:1 and 2:1 M ratios, by DFT/B97D calculations. As main result we found the BGA-1@p-SAC[6] complex as the most stable specie in 2:1 stoichiometry. For this complex, the BGA-1 molecule remains trapped inside the p-SAC[6] tubular dimer with the guest totally encapsulated. Besides, the formation of hydrogen bonds between two p-SAC[6] hosts play a major role on the inclusion complex stabilization. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The inelastic scattering of vibrationally excited NO (upsilon = 1) with Ar at a collision energy of 3.0 kcal mol(-1) was investigated in crossed beams. Vibrationally excited NO was generated by flash heating and rotationally cooled by the supersonic expansion. The differential cross sections were compared to those of the vibrational ground state NO (upsilon = 0) with Ar, which were also compared to theoretical calculations for scattering from the ground vibrational level. The differential cross sections show a similar strong j dependence of the rotational rainbow maxima from the inelastic scattering for both NO (upsilon = 0) and (upsilon = 1) but no significant differences between NO (upsilon = 0) and (upsilon = 1) were seen.

AB Formation mechanism and particle size prediction of rutile nanoparticles for pigment production were investigated. Anatase nanoparticles were observed by oriented attachment with parallel lattice fringe spaces of 0.2419 nm. Upon increasing the calcination temperature, the (1 1 0) plane of rutile was gradually observed, suggesting that the anatase (1 0 3) planes undergo internal structural rearrangement of oxygen and titanium ions into rutile phase due to ionic diffusion. Backpropagation neural network was used to predict particle size of rutile nanopowders, the prediction errors were all smaller than 2%, providing an efficient method to control particle size in pigment production.

AB Recently, the inclusion compound formed by doxycycline and modified CD was investigated. In the inclusion compound, the unstable site of doxycycline was protected by the hydrophobic CD cavity. However, the guest arrangement inside CD cavity has not identified. In some situations, the correlation between protons of the guest and host in a 2D-ROESY experiment can be compatible with head and tail spatial arrangements. In the present work, the most stable guest spatial arrangement for the inclusion of doxycycline into beta-CD was evaluated at B97-D/6-311++(2d,p) level of theory. For sake of comparison, tetracycline inclusion compound was also studied. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB The non-toxic trans isomer of combretastatin-A4 can be photoisomerised in physiological conditions to cis-CA4, a potential anticancer drug. Absorption at wavelengths with high tissue penetration can be achieved by functionalization with substituents influencing the degree of charge-transfer (CT) of the S-1 state, in which the isomerisation occurs. We present a TDDFT study of the excited state properties of a series of substituted combretastatins with various degrees of CT character. Increasing the CT character determines a redshift of absorption and an intensity enhancement, but it disfavours the isomerisation. An appropriate choice of substituents is therefore required to achieve optimal isomerisation conditions. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Structural and optoelectronic properties of phenylene-furan, phenylene-pyrrole and phenylene-thiophene oligomers are reported using density functional theory methods. Studies reveal that stabilities of conformers change with increasing chain length, and helical conformers are energetically feasible for large oligomers of the studied systems, due to stacking interactions between adjacent helical turns. Absorption spectra of helices are dominated by multiple number of electronic transitions other than the S-0 -> S-1, involving orbitals other than the HOMO/LUMO. All studied helices are optically active having similar pattern of negative and positive peaks in the CD spectra. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Filamentous temperature-sensitive Z (FtsZ) protein plays essential role in bacteria cell division, and its inhibition prevents Mycobacteria reproduction. Here we adopted curcumin derivatives as candidates of novel inhibitors and investigated their specific interactions with FtsZ, using ab initio molecular simulations based on protein-ligand docking, classical molecular mechanics and ab initio fragment molecular orbital (FMO) calculations. Based on FMO calculations, we specified the most preferable site of curcumin binding to FtsZ and highlighted the key amino acid residues for curcumin binding at an electronic level. The result will be useful for proposing novel inhibitors against FtsZ based on curcumin derivatives. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The spin transport in ferrocene molecules has been examined by using the nonequilibrium Green's function formalism with density functional theory. The ferrocene molecules were sandwiched between the two nickel electrodes in a parallel magnetic configuration, which enhanced the current in comparison with that in an antiparallel spin state and resulting in tunnel magnetoresistance (TMR). The current, having an opposite spin state to that of the ferromagnetic electrode, was the main channel for electron transport. In addition, it became clear that ferrocenylene molecules, having a fulvalene structure with an extended pi-conjugation, enhanced the TMR effect. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The effects of Al doping on the optical properties of ZnO nanoparticles (NPs) were investigated by steadystate and time-resolved photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy. The doped NPs were prepared by low temperature hydrolysis process. The optical band gap energy of Al-doped ZnO NPs increased from 3.47 to 3.57 eV as Al doping content increased from 0 to 12%. The deep defect states, such as oxygen acceptor and zinc donor induced by Al doping could significantly influence PL spectra and lifetimes of ZnO NPs. In particular, it was found that the Al doping could obviously suppress the electron transfer process from Cu:Zn-In-S quantum dots to the adjacent ZnO NPs. Moreover, the electron transfer rate kET decreased with increasing Al doping content and decreasing temperature. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The CBS-QB3 composite model was employed to obtain optimized geometries and energetics.

AB High temperature thermochemistry of the BBr molecule is investigated with the classical approach in the temperature range of 300-20,000 K. The role of ro-vibrational coupling is elucidated. The internal partition function, thermal energy, heat capacity, and entropy are calculated at three levels of approximation, i.e. taking into account bound states on the ground state ((1)Sigma), including also two excited states ((3)Pi and (1)Pi), and finally adding the resonance and scattering states. The influence of these approximations on studied quantities is investigated. The entropy is found to be the least sensitive to approximations in the ro-vibrational coupling and the heat capacity the most sensitive. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

A change in superconducting transition temperature dependent on composition was observed. The resistivity measurements performed under pressure for NbSe1.5Te0.5 revealed strong enhancement in transition temperature with T-c increasing from 3.35 K at ambient, to 4.4 K at 1.8 GPa, at a rate of 0.6 K/GPa.

AB Li and Sc metals functionalized on the delocalized pi-electrons of benzene rings in [2,2] paracyclophane structure are studied for hydrogen storage efficiency by using the M06 DFT functional with 6-311G(d, p) basis set. It is found that Sc and Li functionalized [2,2] paracyclophane complexes can hold up to 10 H-2 molecules and 8 H-2 molecules by Kubas-Niu-Jena interaction and charge polarization mechanism with hydrogen weight percentage of 11.4 and 13.5, respectively. Molecular dynamics simulation at various temperatures showed appreciable thermal stability while the chemical potential calculation at room temperature reveals that Sc functionalized [2,2] paracyclophane system will be a promising hydrogen storage material.

AB Fullerene-like hydrogenated carbon films have outstanding mechanical and frictional properties, but their structures have never enjoyed elaboration. In this study, we investigate the relation between nano-hardness and elasticity and fullerene-like clusters by changing energy supply form (direct current and pulse) and H-2 concentration in the feedstock. It is found that the films have a network of H-rich amorphous carbon and H-poor or -deficient fullerene-like carbon, and the network change can affect hardness and elastic recovery. This is due to the energy minimization process of the film growing system in a very short pulse period at low temperature. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

These molecules were found to appear in the different rotational states with translational energy varied from a value as low as similar to 1 meV to a distribution with temperature of about 940 K.

AB The peculiarities in the dynamics of the director reorientation in confined nematic liquid crystals (LCs) under the influence of a strong electric field E directed at an angle alpha to the magnetic field B have been investigated theoretically on the basis of the hydrodynamic theory including the director motion with appropriate boundary and initial conditions. Analysis of the numerical results for the turn-on process, when the strong electric field E is suddenly applied, provides an evidence for the appearance of the spatially periodic patterns in confined LC film. Calculations show that when the angle alpha tends to be 90 degrees, the optimum wavelength, giving the fastest response, provides the lower effective viscosity gamma(eff) (alpha), which is less than one in the bulk nematic phase. So, a lower value of gamma(eff) (alpha) gives a faster relaxation times, as observed experimentally by using the time-resolved deuterium NMR spectroscopy. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB We present a combined experimental and theoretical study of the photodissociation of the bisanthenequinone (C28H12O2) cation, Bq(+). The experiments show that, upon photolysis, the Bq(+) cation does not dehydrogenate, but instead fragments through the sequential loss of the two neutral carbonyl groups, causing the formation of five-membered carbon cycles. Quantum chemical calculations confirm this Bq(+) -> [Bq - CO](+) -> [Bq - 2CO](+) sequence as the energetically most favorable reaction pathway. For the first CO loss, a transition state with a barrier of similar to 3.2 eV is found, substantially lower than the lowest calculated H loss dissociation pathway (similar to 4.9 eV). A similar situation applies for the second CO loss channel (similar to 3.8 eV vs. similar to 4.7 eV), but where the first dissociation step does not strongly alter the planar PAH geometry, the second step transforms the molecule into a bowl-shaped one.

AB On the basis of our previous experimental results, the ring-opening hydrolysis reaction mechanisms of two kinds of N-alkylmaleimide dimers without or with the assistance of one and two water molecules have been theoretically investigated in detail. All possible geometries were optimized using the B3LY P/6-311+G(d, p)//B3LYP/6-31+G(d) method in the gas phase and ethanol solution. Calculated results show that every pathway is a four-step hydrolytic degradation process and every step could occur in a concerted way, instead of previously suggested asynchronous stepwise mechanism. Extra H2O or ethanol could act as carriers of proton. The results are consistent with experimental observations. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This work displays the min-max and max-min principles involved in solving different 2 + 1 Dirac fermion problems. The first problem concerns a charged fermionic oscillator in an external homogeneous magnetic field, for which a quantum phase transition was predicted (Bermudez et al., 2008). The 'zeromass' fermion near Dirac point in graphene monolayer constitutes the second example. Here, the minmax and max-min theorems arise from lattice symmetry, being otherwise independent of the trial function. The min-max and max-min principles hold for the trial solution of the fermion with 'nearly zero' mass in diatomic materials with graphene-type lattice. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The terahertz Kerr effect (TKE) of polar molecular vapors is reported. The birefringence signal of fluoroform appears with opposite polarity compared to acetonitrile and water. This behavior is a hallmark of the opposite sign of a new molecular polarizability anisotropy Delta alpha(TKE) = alpha(zz) - (alpha(xx) +alpha(yy))/2 with alpha(zz) being the polarizability along the permanent dipole moment. As the excitation of the rotational states orients the permanent dipoles along the terahertz electric field, the orientation is translated into an optical birefringence proportional to Delta alpha(TKE). Thus, the sign of Delta alpha(TKE) is imprinted onto the TKE signal, providing novel insights into the polarizability tensor of water. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Keeping in mind the advantages of material-based systems over simple molecule-based systems, we have designed and developed three inorganic-organic hybrid systems by anchoring 1,8-naphthalimide derivatives to mesoporous silica nanoparticles for detection of free radicals. Prior to photophysical study, systems are characterized by spectroscopic, microscopic and thermo-gravimetric techniques. Steady state and time-resolved fluorescence studies demonstrate that the hydrazine based system is senstive towards detection of various free radicals. Cellular imaging study reveals cell permeability and toxicity study demonstrates the non-toxic nature of the material.

AB Colloidal quantum dots exhibit size-dependent optical properties due to quantum and dielectric confinements at the semiconductor/solvent boundary. To consider both confinement effects, we take a natural potential well approach that assumes separate potential wells for electron and hole which are surrounded by dielectric media. The potential well depths for electron and hole are set by the band offsets at the semiconductor/solvent heterojunction. The kinetic energy is calculated using an effective mass approximation and the electron-hole interaction energy is obtained by taking image charges into account. For cadmium chalcogenides, resulting transition energies agree well with size-dependent optical bandgaps from experiments. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The photophysical properties of harmaline were modulated several folds due to addition of cucurbit[7] uril in the aqueous buffer solution. We have observed quenching of fluorescence intensity of harmaline with gradual addition of CB7.

AB Vibronic dynamics of o-dichlorobenzene in its lowest excited singlet state, S-1, is investigated in real time by using femtosecond pump-probe method, combined with time-of-flight mass spectroscopy and photoelectron velocity mapping technique. Relaxation processes for the excitation in the range of 276-252 nm can be fitted by single exponential decay model, while in the case of wavelength shorter than 252 nm two-exponential decay model must be adopted for simulating transient profiles. Lifetime constants of the vibrationally excited S-1 states change from 651 +/- 10 ps for 276 nm excitation to 61 +/- 1 ps for 242 nm excitation. Both the internal conversion from the S-1 to the highly vibrationally excited ground state S-0 and the intersystem crossing from the S-1 to the triplet state are supposed to play important roles in deexcitation processes. Exponential fitting of the de-excitation rates on the excitation energy implies such de-excitation process starts from the highly vibrationally excited S-0 state, which is validated, by probing the relaxation following photoexcitation at 281 nm, below the S-1 origin. Time-dependent photoelectron kinetic energy distributions have been obtained experimentally. As the excitation wavelength changes from 276 nm to 242 nm, different cationic vibronic vibrations can be populated, determined by the Franck-Condon factors between the large geometry distorted excited singlet states and final cationic states.

AB The absorption spectra of vapors of concentrated hydrogen peroxide/ water mixtures (without a carrier gas) were characterized at wavelengths from 1390 to 1470 nm utilizing a near-infrared diode laser. Low pressures were employed to examine these spectral features near the Doppler-broadened limit. An advantageous portion of the spectra near 1420 nm containing several distinct H2O2 peaks and one well-known H2O peak (for calibration) was identified and the cross-sections of these peaks determined. These cross section values can be employed to measure vapor-phase concentrations of H2O2 in propulsion, atmospheric chemistry, and sterilization applications. (C) 2018 The Aerospace Corporation.

AB The present paper seeks to establish a theoretical framework to account for the spontaneous molecular ordering at free surfaces of molecular aggregates. It is shown that within a multipole representation of the molecular interactions, ordering is the effect of the interplay of two fundamental causes: the translational symmetry breaking of the bulk phase at the interface and the interactions of multipoles of different parity. Quantitative analysis of the order parameter demonstrates the building up of ordering at different length scales with range depending on the strength of the interactions. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB Distortion in octahedral structure of 3d transition metal complexes (Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn) has been studied using XAFS showing divergent nature of Cu complex. EXAFS analysis showed elongated metal-oxygen bonds for Cu complex leading to more distorted structure. Derivative XANES spectrum at Cu K-edge exhibits splitting of main edge which is correlated to elongated Cu-O bond length. Using these coordination geometry around metal centers, theoretical XANES spectra have been generated and features observed have been correlated to the corresponding metals p-DOS. It has been shown that distorted octahedral field in Cu complex is responsible for splitting of p-DOS. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In order to get a physical insight into the pentacene interlayer-modulated resistive switching (RS) characteristics, the Au/pentacene/poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA)/heavily doped p-type Si (p(+)-Si)/In and Au/PMMA/p(+)-Si/In devices are fabricated and the device performance is provided. The Au/pentacene/PMMA/p(+)-Si/In device shows R-S behavior, whereas the Au/PMMA/p(+)-Si/In device exhibits the set/reset-free hysteresis current-voltage characteristics. The insertion of a pentacene layer is a noticeable contribution to the R-S characteristic. This is because of the occurrence of carrier accumulation/depletion in the pentacene interlayer. The transition from carrier depletion to carrier accumulation (carrier accumulation to carrier depletion) in pentacene occurring under negative (positive) voltage induces the process of set (reset). The switching conduction mechanism is primarily described as space charge limited conduction according to the electrical transport properties measurement. The concept of a pentacene/PMMA heterostructure opens a promising direction for organic memory devices. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Two-color resonance two-photon ionization and mass analyzed threshold ionization spectra of 2-aminobenzonitrile have been obtained. The band origin of the S-1 <- S-0 transition and the precise ionization energy (IE) were determined to be 31,265 +/- 2 cm(-1) and 66,653 +/- 5 cm(-1), respectively. The most active modes in the S-1 and D-0 states are related to the in-plane ring vibrations. The relative errors of IE estimated by CBS-QB3 and G4 are -0.18% and + 1.47%, respectively. The theoretical calculations well support our experimental findings. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The conformational space of beta-turns of Ala-Gly dipeptide is analyzed theoretically using quantum mechanical methods. A number of potential minima are obtained and characterized. The potential energy surface suggests that beta-turn conformers are susceptible to rapid radical formation, which leads to potential L and D epimerization. The calculated thermodynamics show that the radical mediated epimerization is possible and that the estimated barrier height for hydrogen abstraction on the C alpha is the lowest for the Gly residue.

AB The phenomena of solvent exchange control the process of solvating ions, protons, and charged molecules. Building upon our extension of Marcus' philosophy of electron transfer, we provide a new perspective of ultrafast solvent exchange mechanism around ions measurable by two-dimensional infrared (2DIR) spectroscopy. In this theory, solvent rearrangement drives an ion-bound water to an activated state of higher coordination number, triggering ion-water separation that leads to the solvent-bound state of the water molecule. This ion-bound to solvent-bound transition rate for a BF(4)(-)water system is computed using ab initio molecular dynamics and Marcus theory, and is found to be in excellent agreement with the 2DIR measurement.

AB Using a flexible polarizable potential, the stable structures of H (H-2)(n)(D-2)(p) clusters with fixed total size n thorn p = 32 have been investigated by means of path- integral molecular dynamics simulations as a function of composition. The most stable phase is found to be reverse core-shell, in which the heavier deuterium molecules reside outside. This result contrasts with neutral clusters, in which deuterium preferentially occupies internal sites. This purely quantum effect is interpreted to originate from the significant weakening of hydrogen covalent bonds in the vicinity of the ionic impurity and its lowering of zero- point energy that affects H-2 more than D-2.

AB Autoimmune disease encompasses an array of conditions with a variety of presentations and the involvement of multiple organs. Though the etiologies of many autoimmune conditions are unclear, uncontrolled inflammatory immune response is believed to be a major cause of disease development and progression. Progranulin (PGRN), an anti-inflammatory molecule with therapeutic effect in inflammatory arthritis, was identified as an endogenous antagonist of TNF alpha by competitively binding to TNFR. PGRN exerts its anti-inflammatory activity through multiple pathways, including induction of T-reg differentiation and IL-10 expression and inhibition of chemokine release from macrophages. In addition, the protective role of PGRN has also been demonstrated in osteoarthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, and psoriasis. Intriguingly, PGRN was reported to contribute to development of insulin resistance in high fat diet induced diabetes. Emerging evidences indicate that PGRN may also be associated with various autoimmune diseases, including systemic lupus erythematous, systemic sclerosis, multiple sclerosis and Sjogren's syndrome. This review summarizes recent studies of PGRN as a novel target molecule in the field of autoimmune disease, and provides updated information to inspire future studies. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The adsorption and dissociation behaviors of molecular H2O on the Li4SiO4 (0 1 0) surface have been systematically studied by first-principles calculations. It is found that the adsorbed H2O molecule mainly interacts with the O and Li atoms of the surface, that is, H atom bonds with O atoms of the surface while O atom bonds with the surface Li atoms due to the hydrogen bond effect. According to the different adsorption energies and vibrational frequencies of H2O, different adsorption types can be classified. These results may explain the origin of multiple desorption peaks in TDS experiments. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The density functional theory (DFT) method with non-equilibrium Green's function (NEGF) method is used to study the electronic properties of the graphyne nanotube device. The graphyne nanotube is used as a base material to graft photochromic spiropyran and merocyanine molecules. The current voltage characteristics clearly give the insights on the switching properties of spiropyran and merocyanine grafted graphyne device. The findings show that spiropyran grafted graphyne device as ON state and merocyanine grafted graphyne device as an OFF state device. Moreover, upon shining light of proper wavelength, the spiropyran/merocyanine grafted graphyne nanotube device can be used as a switch. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Formation of Au-Pd nanoalloys and loading onto the RGO are accomplished simultaneously. The Au-Pd/reduced graphene oxide (Au-Pd/RGO) exhibits higher catalytic activity than both Au/RGO and Pd/RGO, prepared by the same approach toward selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol and selective reduction of nitroaromatics, the catalytic activity order can be in good agreement with the noble metal particles size distribution of the Au, Pd and Au-Pd/RGO.

AB Ce3+/Eu2+ doped SrSc2O4 phosphors were synthesized by a solid state reaction. The phase and luminescent properties of the synthesized phosphors were investigated. In SrSc2O4 host, Ce3(+/)Eu(2+) substitute Sr2+ sites and form the solid solution. Ce3+/Eu2+ singly doped SrSc2O4 phosphors respectively show emission band locating in green and deep red regions and the emission peaks shift to longer wavelength with the increasing concentration due to the enhancements of crystal field. In Ce3+/Eu2+ codoped SrSc2O4 phosphors, the intensities of Ce3+ and Eu2+ emissions change with the changing Eu2+ concentrations due to energy transfer from Ce3+ to Eu2+. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB We measure the flow regime change of C-60 molecular beams, produced by a Knudsen oven with an orifice (diameter, 1 mm; thickness, 0.5 mm), from effusive to transitional. We determine the change temperature to be about 800 K and find an inefficient translational cooling of C-60 molecules in the transitional regime. Such an inefficient cooling leads us to modify the velocity distribution function assumed standardly in directed molecular beams. The determined change temperature could be used as a benchmark for estimating the beam regime in experiments involving C-60 molecular beams prepared by a Knudsen oven with a thin millimeter-scale orifice.

AB In the present study, we report a detail investigation on the effect of insolubility of Ag 40% doping on the structural and magnetic properties of LCMO-Ag compound prepared by solid-state reaction. The analysis of X-ray diffraction for our samples using Rietveld refinement showed that they crystallize in the orthorhombic structure with Pnma space group. We have shown that this compound has a secondary phase (Ag metallic phase). The detailed analyses of Hirshfeld surface and fingerprint plots provide insight into the nature of intermolecular interactions in the title compound. Magnetization measurements versus temperature at different magnetic fields have shown the presence of two magnetic transitions. This result was confirmed previously in the crystallographic study. This phase exhibits magnetic properties, which has a Curie temperature (Tc) which is lower than the Curie temperature of the FM-PM transition. The critical properties of perovskite manganite LCMO-Ag around of transition with Tc = 230 K is investigated through various techniques such as modified Arrott plot, Kouvel-Fisher method, and critical isotherm analysis. Moreover, the critical exponents also obeyed the single scaling equation of M(H, epsilon)vertical bar epsilon vertical bar (beta) = f(+/-) (H vertical bar epsilon vertical bar(-(beta+gamma))). We find that the critical exponent for LCMO-Ag is close to that theoretically predicted for mean field tricritical model. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Structural parameters and band gap energies were determined in agreement with experimental data, with errors under 2%. The methods Electron Localization Function and Quantum Theory of Atoms in Molecules were applied to the analyses of the electronic density topology of the three solids. These methodologies indicated that the bonds between the metallic cations and the oxygen atoms are predominantly ionic while the other ones are predominantly covalent. Furthermore, non-conventional hydrogen bonds were identified to Mg-MOF-74 and Co-MOF-74, which were not observed to Mn-MOF-74. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Graphene can be viewed as sheet of benzene rings fused together forming a variety of structures including the trioxotriangulenes (TOTs) which is a class of organic molecules with electro-active properties. In order to clarify such properties, structures and electronic properties of the graphene fragments phenalenyl, triangulene, 6-oxophenalenoxyl, and X3TOT (X = H, F, Cl) are computed. Validation of the methodologies are carried out using the density functionals B3LYP, M06-2X, B2PLYP-D, and the MP2 theory, giving equilibrium geometries of benzene, naphthalene, and anthracene with mean unsigned error (MUE) of only 0.003, 0.007, 0.004, and 0.007 A, respectively in relation to experiment.

AB Hydrogen abstraction from CH3NH2, (CH3)(2)NH, and (CH3)(3)N by H<(O)over dot>(2) radicals, is investigated via quantum chemistry calculations. The B3LYP/6-31G(2df, p) method is employed in geometry optimizations, frequencies, and intrinsic reaction coordinate calculations. The G4 method is applied in energy and thermodynamical property calculations. Rate constants are obtained from variation transition state theory and conventional transition state theory calculations with one-dimensional hindered rotor treatment and Eckart tunneling correction. A branching ratio analysis for each reaction system is further performed. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Currently, phase change materials (PCMs) composite fibers are typically prepared by electrospinning. However, electrospinning exhibits safety concerns and a low production rate, which limit its practical applications as a cost-effective fiber fabrication approach. Therefore, a novel, and simple centrifugal spinning technology is employed to extrude fibers from composite solutions using a high-speed rotary and perforated spinneret. The composite fibers based on polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) and polyethylene glycol (PEG) were prepared by centrifugal spinning. The SEM of PVP/PEG composite fibers indicated that the fibrous morphology is well preserved. The DSC and TGA indicated that PVP/PEG composite fibers exhibit good thermal properties.

AB The solid molecular hydrogen under hydrostatic pressure varying from 0 up to 2.2 GPa at low temperatures is studied by path-integral Monte Carlo simulations in the isothermal-isobaric ensemble. The quantum contribution to the vibrational energy lies between 40% and 90% of their total values. The zero-point energy increases with increasing pressure and the anharmonicity is more pronounced at low temperature and pressure. A satisfactory agreement between our simulation results and available experimental measurements has been achieved. At very low temperatures, the quantum effects are responsible for softening the molecular crystal in about 1 GPa in the studied range of pressure. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The potential applicability of B-40 and Li@B-40 fullerenes as chemical sensors for NO2 pollutant detection is investigated by employing DFT calculations. The results indicate that NO2 molecule is remarkably chemisorbed on the surface of both B-40 and Li@B-40 fullerenes. It is found that electronic properties of B-40 and Li@B-40 fullerenes change after NO2 chemisorption. Although the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO)-lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energies gap (HLG) of B-40 is considerably decreased after NO2 chemisorption, the HLG of Li@B-40 are significantly enhanced after NO2 adsorption. B-40 and Li@B-40 fullerenes are introduced as novel promising chemical sensor for NO2 pollutant. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The nanoporous CuO retained the bamboo leaf-like shape and was composed of nanocrysals with grain size of 5080 nm. The CuO electrode was very stable and exhibited a specific capacitance of 269.6 F g(-1) at a current density of 0.25 A g(-1). The CuO electrode could be cycled at least 500 cycles, and the capacitance retention ratio was as 88.79% at the current density of 2 A g(-1). (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB We report the first femtosecond time-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy study of 2-, 3-and 4-nitrobenzaldehyde (NBA) and nitrobenzene (NBE) in the gas phase upon excitation at 200 nm. In 3- and 4-NBA, the dynamics follow fast intersystem crossing within 1-2 picoseconds. In 2-NBA and NBE, the dynamics are faster (similar to 0.5 ps). 2-NBA undergoes hydrogen transfer similar to solution phase dynamics. NBE either releases NO2 in the excited state or converts internally back to the ground state. We discuss why these channels are suppressed in the other nitrobenzaldehydes. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

The nature of the interaction in these complexes, termed anionic tetrel-bonding, is studied by molecular electrostatic potential, noncovalent interaction, quantum theory of atoms in molecules and natural bond orbital analyses. The interaction energies of these complexes span a large range, from -1.74 kcal/mol in F4C:SCN- to -84.37 kcal/mol in (CN)F3Si:F-.

AB Rate coefficients for the vibrational relaxation of O-2(a(1) Delta, upsilon) by CO2 have been determined from the decay of fluorescence of the a(1) Delta(g) -> X-3 Sigma(-)(g) (upsilon-upsilon') transitions with upsilon = upsilon' = 1, 2 and 3. O-2(a(1) Delta, upsilon) molecules were produced by pulsed laser photolysis of ozone at a wavelength of 266 nm. The rate coefficients were measured to be (1.9 +/- 0.2) x 10(-14) cm(3)/s, (2.4 +/- 0.2) x 10(-14) cm(3)/s and (2.7 +/- 0.3) x 10(-14) cm(3)/s for upsilon = 1, 2 and 3 respectively.

TI Induced abortion among women veterans: data from the ECUUN study

DT Article
DE Women; Veterans; Abortion; Hyde Amendment

AB Objective: We compared rates of induced abortion among women veterans receiving Veterans Affairs (VA) healthcare to rates in the general US population, as current policy prohibits VA provision of abortion counseling or services even when pregnancy endangers a veteran's life.
   Methods: We analyzed data from 2298 women veterans younger than 45 years who completed a telephone-based, cross-sectional survey of randomly sampled English-speaking women from across the United States who had received VA healthcare. We compared lifetime, last-5-year and last-year rates of unintended pregnancy and abortion among participants to age-matched data from the National Survey of Family Growth. As few abortions were reported in the last year, we used multivariable logistic regression to examine associations between abortion in the last 5 years and age, race/ethnicity, income, education, religion, marital status, parity, geography, deployment history, housing instability, and past medical and mental health among VA patients.
   Results: Women veterans were more likely than matched US women to report ever having an abortion [17.7%, 95% confidence interval (CI): 16.1%-19.3% vs. 15.2% of US women]. In the last 5 years, unintended pregnancy and abortion were reported by veterans at rates similar to US women. In multivariable models, VA patients were more likely to report abortion in the last 5 years if their annual income was less than $40,000 (adjusted odds ratio (OR) 2.95, 95% CI 1.30-6.70), they had experienced homelessness or housing instability (adjusted OR 1.91, 95% CI 1.01-3.62), they were single (adj. OR 2.46, 95% CI 1.23-4.91) and/or they had given birth (adjusted OR 2.29, 95% CI 1.19-4.40).
   Conclusion: Women veterans face unintended pregnancy and seek abortion as often as the larger US population.
   Implications: The Veterans Health Care Act, which prohibits provision of abortion services, increases vulnerable veterans' out-of-pocket healthcare costs and limits veterans' reproductive freedom. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB TNF alpha is a principal pro-inflammatory cytokine vital for immunity to infections. However, its excessive production is involved in chronic inflammation and disease pathology in autoimmune diseases. Evidence for its pathogenic role is validated by the fact that its neutralisation by therapeutic agents in vivo is beneficial in ameliorating disease and controlling symptoms. Paradoxically, however, treatment with TNF alpha inhibitors can either have no clinical effects, or even exacerbate disease in some patients. The explanation for such contradictory outcomes may lay in how and which downstream signalling pathways are activated and drive disease. TNF alpha causes its effects by binding to either or both of two membrane-bound receptors, TNFR1 and TNFR2. Engagement of the receptors can induce cell death or cell proliferation.
   T cells both produce and respond to TNF alpha and depending on whether the cytokine is membrane-bound or soluble and the level of expression of its two receptors, the biological outcome can be distinct. In addition, polymorphisms in genes encoding TNF alpha and T cell signalling proteins can significantly impact the outcome of TNF alpha receptor engagement. Early studies revealed that effector T cells in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) are hyporesponsive due to chronic exposure to TNF alpha. However, recent evidence indicates that the relationship between TNF alpha and T cell responses is complex and, at times, can be paradoxical. In addition, there is controversy as to the specific effects of TNF alpha on different T cell subsets. This review will summarise knowledge on how TNF alpha modulates T cell responses and the effect of engaging either of its two receptors. Furthermore, we discuss how such interactions can dictate the outcome of treatment with TNF alpha inhibitors. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Tumor Necrosis Factor alpha (TNF alpha, TNF) is a key mediator and regulator of mammalian immune responses in healthy organisms and in diseased conditions. TNF governs development of the immune system, cell survival signaling pathways, proliferation and regulates metabolic processes. Whereas TNF-induced NF-kappa B and MAP pro-survival kinase activities constitute its major biochemical functions, TNF can also stimulate cell death in certain pathological situations. TNF-induced signal transduction pathways are tightly regulated through ubiquitination and phosphorylation of molecules partaking in all TNF-dependent membrane-associated and intracellular protein signaling complexes. Deregulated TNF signaling in individuals carrying naturally occurring genetic mutations in proteins that mediate TNF signaling, or in corresponding genetically modified animal models, results in severe pathologies. In this review we will describe the current knowledge of TNF signaling and its relevance for human health. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha is a potent pro-inflammatory and pathological cytokines in inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory bowel diseases. Anti-TNF-alpha therapy has been established as an efficacious therapeutic strategy in these diseases. In clinical settings, three monoclonal anti-TNF-alpha, full IgG1 antibodies infliximab, adalimumab, and golimumab, PEGylated Fab' fragment of anti-TNF-alpha antibody certolizumab pegol, extracellular domain of TNF receptor 2/IgG1-Fc fusion protein etanercept, are almost equally effective for rheumatoid arthritis. Although monoclonal full IgG1 antibodies are able to induce clinical and endoscopic remission in inflammatory bowel diseases, certolizumab pegol without Fc portion has been shown to be less effective for inflammatory bowel diseases compared to full IgG1 antibodies. In addition, there are no evidences that etanercept leads clinical remission in inflammatory bowel diseases. Besides the common effect of anti-TNF-alpha agents on neutralization of soluble TNF-alpha, each anti-TNF-alpha agent has its own distinctive pharmacological properties which cause the difference in clinical efficacies. Here we focus on the distinctions of action of anti-TNF-alpha agents especially in following points; (1) blocking ability against ligands, transmembrane TNF-alpha, and lymphotoxin, (2) effects toward transmembrane TNF-alpha-expressing cells, (3) effects toward Fc gamma receptor-expressing cells, (4) degradation and distribution in inflamed tissue. Accumulating evidence will give us the idea how to modify anti-TNF-alpha agents to enhance the clinical efficacy in inflammatory diseases. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB With the continuous social and economic development, the output of municipal sewage sludge is increasingly rising. Sludge treatment and disposal technologies need economical investment and resource consumption, and their comprehensive performance should be investigated from pros and cons, to provide systematic information for policy-makers. Based on the characteristics of sludge treatment and/or disposal systems, this study proposed an improved emergy approach which considered emissions' impact, and then it presented a set of indicator system to explore the comprehensive performance of sewage treatment/disposal practice. Application of the proposed method and indictors to one sewage sludge treatment system with earthworm compositing technology located in Chengdu, China results show that (1) the dewatered sludge is the main contributor to this system, followed by mushroom dregs; (2) direct emissions from diesel use should be emphasized; (3) this system can promote resource conservation effectively through lower emergy investment; (4) emissions' impact slightly reduces the comprehensive performance; (5) this system is not sustainable in the long term due to great dependence on nonrenewable resources. Finally, this work puts forward some improvement suggestions for the sewage sludge treatment practice.

AB Nitrite-dependent anaerobic methane oxidation (n-damo) process, performed by "Candidatus Methylomirabilis oxyfera" (M. oxyfera), can be an important methane sink in wetland anoxic layers. However, little is known about the distribution and variability of M. oxyfera-like bacteria in constructed wetlands (CWs). The current study investigated spatial and seasonal dynamics of M. oxyfera-like bacteria in a free water surface flow CW (FWSF-CW) used to improve river water quality and explored the influences of wetland environmental variables. In the FWSF-CW, M. oxyfera-like bacterial abundance was found to change considerably among both sampling sites and seasons, ranged between 8.99 x 10(5) and 4.34 x 10(6) 16S rRNA gene copies per gram dry sediment/soil. Considerable spatial and seasonal variations of M. oxyfera-like bacterial richness, diversity, and community structure were also observed in the FWSF-CW. In addition, both nutrients and temperature were the key factors determining the community structure of wetland M. oxyfera-like bacteria.

AB Highway slope landscape design in China usually specifies a single type of grass or uses randomly mixed native plants. This approach has limited slope protection effects considering plants' early growth capacity, species diversity, vegetation succession, and other factors. To address this limitation, this paper proposed a cross-disciplinary approach. First, the runoff plot method was used to study the early stage slope protection effects of seven different vegetation communities (VCs) selected for Xinnan Highway, which has steep slopes ranging from 30 degrees to 33 degrees. The results showed that i) the VCs that resulted in the least soil erosion contain only herbaceous plants or a mixture of herbs and shrub; and ii) the herb-vine combination had the worst performance. Hierarchical cluster analysis then classified the tested VCs into groups with similar slope protection effects and revealed that VCs with either the same or different community structures could cluster together. Further, the correlation analysis found significant relationships between soil erosion and multiple input variables, including rainfall amount and intensity, vegetation coverage, growth rates of herbs and bushes, above-ground biomass, and soil hydraulic conductivity. Lastly, based on 442 data points collected in the experiment, fine-tuned artificial neural network models were developed to predict soil erosion and achieved high accuracy with correlation coefficients ranging from 0.9713 to 0.9776. Collectively, the results of this research provide not only insights but also a practical tool for designing plant communities that can potentially achieve the best slope protection effects, especially in the early stage of slope restoration.

AB Spillway passage is one of the commonly accepted dam passage alternatives for downstream-migrating salmonids and other species. Fish passing in spill near the water surface may have improved chances of survival over fish that pass deeper in the water column near spillway structures. In this study, an autonomous sensor device (Sensor Fish) was deployed in 2005 to evaluate fish passage conditions through the Removable Spillway Weir (RSW) at Ice Harbor Dam on the Snake River in south-central Washington State. The Sensor Fish deployment was undertaken concurrently with a separate live fish injury and survival study. Conditions at the RSW-Spillway Chute Transition and Deflector region were found to be potentially detrimental to fish. As a result, the spillway slope and deflector radius were modified, and the efficacy of the modifications was evaluated in 2015 using Sensor Fish and a concurrent live fish study. The frequency of severe acceleration events (acceleration >= 95 G) during passage decreased significantly (from 51% to 35%; p-value = 0.049), and collisions with structures decreased from 47% to 27% (p-value = 0.015). Pressures observed in the Spillway-Deflector region and pressure rates of change decreased as well. Overall, the modifications resulted in hydraulic conditions that contributed to improved fish passage conditions and increased fish survival.

AB Tree species effects in afforestation of post-industrial lands have important impacts on biodiversity of restored sites. We aimed to assess tree species effects on bryophytes in a novel ecosystem - a reclaimed lignite mine spoil heap. We investigated bryophyte species pools in tree stands of six species: Alnus glutinosa, Betula pendula, Pinus sylvestris, Quercus robur, Q. rubra and Robinia pseudoacacia in two substratum groups: epigeic and epiphytic species. We assessed beta-diversity among tree stand types and bryophyte guilds. We also analyzed impacts of light availability, pH and C/N ratios of bark and soil, annual litterfall and bark water capacity of the main tree species, on bryophyte species pools among tree stands and species groups, using canonical correspondence analysis. Our study revealed tree species effects on bryophyte species richness, beta-diversity and composition. Main mechanisms connected with tree species effects were light availability and substratum C/N ratio, as well as substratum pH and bark water capacity. We confirmed that tree species traits connected with C/N ratios and light availability affect bryophyte species composition. Guilds of bryophytes responded differently to tree species effects on ecosystem properties and their turnover differed between tree stands. Influence of the factors studied on species pools was similar to those reported from mature woodlands. Presence of many woodland specific bryophytes has shown restoration success ca. 30 years after afforestation of post-industrial land. Different tree species provided different habitats for bryophytes, and therefore decisions regarding what tree species to plant affect restoration success and the future bryophyte species pool.

AB The grassland degradation caused by overgrazing is the result of imbalance of energy flow and material cycle under grazing pressure in the ecosystem, and numerous ecological restoration and ecological engineering techniques widely used to restore some ecosystem. However, little research known focused on the relationship (energy flow and material cycle) between plant and soil under different grazing intensity, especially at the rhizosphere which is the most powerful area of plant and soil interaction. In this research we conducted a 5-year grazing experiment including 4 different grazing intensities (no grazing, UG; light grazing, LG; moderate grazing, MG; and heavy grazing, HG) in an alpine meadow on the northeastern margin of Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (QTP). Plants and soil materials were sampled in July 2015, and to examine the nutrients concentration and ecological stoichiometric of vegetation and soil, the soil microbial biomass and activity, as well as their relationship with vegetation and soil characteristics. We found that grazing increased vegetation and soil nutrient concentrations and increased the ratio of microbial biomass carbon (MBC) to microbial biomass nitrogen (MBC), but the grazing intensity did not significantly influence the nutrients enrichment ratio of rhizosphere soil. There was significant relationship between total carbon (TC) concentration of vegetation and soil, and between vegetation total phosphorus (TP) and soil PO43--P concentration. These results suggested that vegetation and soil nutrient concentrations respond differently to the grazing intensity. Coupling relationship exists in specific nutrients of vegetation and soil and rhizosphere is a powerful tool to understanding the linkage between plant and soil.

AB This study investigated the biodegradability of composting leachate and biogas production in different Organic Loading Rates (OLRs) in lab-scale series AMBR-ASBR bioreactors, Anaerobic Migrating Blanket Reactor (AMBR) and Anaerobic Sequencing Batch Reactor (ASBR). The raw Leachate with OLRs of 1.04-19.65 gCOD/L. d went into the AMBR reactor and then into the ASBR reactor with hydraulic retention time of 24 h. The produced methane and biogas were measured by GC-TCD and gas meter. The results showed that the best removal efficiency for BOD5, COD and readily biodegradable COD (rbCOD) in AMBR-ASBR hybrid reactor were 99.43%, 97.35% and 99.79%, respectively. The maximum amounts of biogas and methane production were 16.37 and 9.99 L in OLR of 10.08 gCOD/L. d. With the increase in OLRs, biogas production also increased, but in higher OLRs (18.52 gCOD/L. d) with a sudden increase in OLR, methane and biogas production decreased. Moreover, the ratio of the biogas production to inlet COD was 1.35 L (R-2 = 0.994), that is equal to the ratio of produced biogas (L) to inlet Volatile Suspended Solids (VSS) (g) (R-2 = 0.972). Thus, considering OLRs effects, it was observed that the AMBR-ASBR hybrid reactor as a novel series system could be remarkably efficient in compost leachate treatment and increasing biogas production.

AB A full-scale hybrid system utilizing horizontal subsurface flow constructed wetlands (HFCWs) with iron-carbon micro-electrolysis (ICME) pre-treatment was developed for farmer household tourism wastewater (FHTWW) treatment in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China. Results of the 12 months study revealed that the optimal iron-toactive carbon mass ratio (Fe/C), initial pH value and iron with active carbon-to-water volume ratio (Fe-C/water) of ICME were 1: 1, 4.0 and 1: 4 respectively. Meanwhile, the BOD5-to-COD concentration ratio (B/C) of FHTWW was increased from an average value of 0.16-0.39, which indicated the effluent of ICME not only met the national standard for subsequent HFCWs, but also was appropriate to further biological treatment. Generally, the COD removal efficiency of the hybrid system could increase by more than 30% compared with HFCWs only. Although the concentration of ammonia nitrogen (NH4+-N) and total nitrogen (TN) in raw FHTWW varied greatly between seasons, their average removal rate reached 96.8 +/- 1.2% and 95.9 +/- 1.4% respectively depending on appropriate COD-to-TN ratio (C/N) of 3.08-6.19 and limited dissolved oxygen (DO) of 0.5-0.7 mg/L. The hybrid system has withstood the unusually rainy season in July 2016. Results showed that the average COD, BOD5 and NH4+-N concentration in the final effluent were 28.3 mg/L, 5.8 mg/L and 1.3 mg/L respectively, which satisfied the environmental quality standards for surface water in China (COD <= 30 mg/L, BOD5 <= 6 mg/L, NH4+-N <= 1.5 mg/L).

AB Postplacental intrauterine device (IUD) placement, defined as IUD placement within 10 min after delivery of the placenta, is an appealing strategy for increasing access to postpartum IUDs because it does not require a separate postpartum visit. These guidelines present an evidence-based assessment of postplacental IUD placement after vaginal and cesarean delivery. Postplacental IUD insertion is safe and does not have higher risks of complications than interval insertion. Most studies find that the risk of IUD expulsion is higher after postplacental insertion than after interval insertion for both vaginal and cesarean deliveries. Most studies find higher rates of expulsion after vaginal delivery than after cesarean delivery. However, expulsion rates vary widely across studies, without clear evidence about the factors that may influence expulsion. In settings where replacement of expelled IUDs is available, patient populations with low rates of return for the postpartum visit are most likely to benefit from provision of postplacental IUD placement with appropriate counseling about risks and benefits.

   FAMILY GROWTH; WOMEN; RISK
AB Objective: The objective was to examine levels of, correlates of and changes in the use of individual and grouped methods of contraception among US females aged 15-44 from 2008 to 2014.
   Study design: Using three rounds of the National Survey of Family Growth, we analyzed samples of 12,279 (2008), 5601 (2012) and 5699 (2014) females. We conducted simple and multivariable logistic regression analyses to identify associations between demographic characteristics and contraceptive use, as well as between characteristics and changes in use patterns.
   Results: In terms of overall trends in contraceptive use between 2008 and 2014, there was no significant change in the proportion of women who used a method among either all women (60%) or those at risk of unintended pregnancy (90%). Significant changes in use occurred among six methods. The largest increase in use was among users of long-acting reversible contraceptive (LARC) methods, including the intrauterine device and implant - from 6% to 14% - across almost all population groups of female contraceptive users, while the largest decrease occurred among users of sterilization - from 37% to 28% - with lower-income women driving the decline in female sterilization and higher-income women driving the decline in a partner's sterilization as a primary method. Moderate increases were seen in the use of withdrawal and natural family planning.
   Conclusion: Most shifts in recent contraceptive use have occurred among the most effective methods - sterilization and LARCs. Differences in method-specific user characteristics underscore the importance of ensuring full access to the broad range of methods available.
   Implications: The lack of change in the overall use of contraceptives among women at risk for unintended pregnancy may have implications for the extent to which further declines in national rates of unintended pregnancy can be expected. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB Objective: This study assesses provider communication with adolescent and young women about birth control, emergency contraception and condoms during sexual and reproductive health visits.
   Study design: Using data from sexually active 15-24-year-old women in the 2011-2015 National Survey of Family Growth, we examined provider communication about contraception and condoms at sexual and reproductive health services in the past year and assessed differences by demographics, sexual behavior and source of care.
   Results: Approximately two thirds of women received provider communication about condoms (65.0%) and birth control (64.0%-66.8%). Communication was higher among Title-X-funded clinic vs. private providers. Differences by age, race/ethnicity, mother's education, number of partners and condom use were also found.
   Conclusion: Most sexually active young women attending sexual and reproductive health visits received provider communication about condoms and birth control, but communication is not universal and varies by source of care, demographics and sexual behavior. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier Inc.

ID STRESS SYMPTOMS; MINORITY WOMEN; PERIOD
AB Objective: We sought to determine the prevalence of postpartum contraceptive use among women with postpartum depressive symptoms (PDS) and examine the association between PDS and contraceptive method.
   Study design: We evaluated data from 16,357 postpartum women participating in the 2009-2011 Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System. PDS was defined as an additive score of 10 for three questions on depression, hopelessness, and feeling physically slowed. Contraceptive use was categorized as permanent, long-acting reversible contraception (LARC), user-dependent hormonal, and user dependent non-hormonal. Logistic regression models compared postpartum contraceptive use and method by PDS status.
   Results: In total, 12.3% of women with a recent live birth reported PDS. Large percentages of women with (69.4%) and without (76.1%) PDS, used user-dependent or no contraceptive method. There were no associations between PDS and use of any postpartum contraception (adjusted Prevalence Ratio (aPR) = 1.00, 95% CI 0.98-1.03) or permanent contraception (aPR=1.05, 95% CI 0.88-1.27). LARC use was elevated, but not significantly, among women with PDS compared to those without (aPR=1.16, 95% CI: 1.00-1.34).
   Conclusions: Large percentages of women with and without PDS used user-dependent or no contraception. Since depression may be associated with misuse of user-dependent methods, counseling women about how to use methods more effectively, as well as the effectiveness of non-user dependent methods, may be beneficial.

ID CENTERED CARE; GENERAL-PRACTICE; SATISFACTION; PERFORMANCE; SERVICES
AB Objective: The objective was to describe the development and assess evidence of the validity of a patient-reported scale measuring the interpersonal quality of contraceptive counseling.
   Study design: We performed initial item selection based on qualitative work regarding patient preferences for contraceptive counseling and a review of patient-reported measures of communication. We then administered these items as part of a cohort study of women receiving contraceptive counseling, along with items measuring patient satisfaction with counseling and method choice, and coded audio recordings of the contraceptive counseling visits for patient-centered communication. We determined the final scale based on interitem correlations and exploratory factor analysis. Predictive validity of the scale has been demonstrated previously. We assessed content, construct, convergent and discriminant validity by investigating associations between the final scale and the satisfaction and audio-recording-derived measures using mixed effects logistic regression.
   Results: The items were administered to 346 women between 2009 and 2012 in the San Francisco area. We selected an 11-item, 1-factor Interpersonal Quality of Family Planning (IQFP) scale, with a Cronbach's alpha of 0.95. This scale showed positive associations with measures of satisfaction with counseling and with the chosen method. IQFP was also associated with provider communication practices, including eliciting the patient perspective and demonstrating empathy.
   Conclusions and implications: The IQFP scale demonstrates construct, convergent, discriminant and predictive validity for measuring the interpersonal quality of contraceptive counseling. It shows promise as a measure that can be used in research and quality improvement efforts to ensure that patients' experiences and preferences are prioritized in family planning care.

AB Objective: To determine if obese women experience increased rates of adverse outcomes with moderate intravenous sedation during first trimester surgical abortion compared to normal weight women.
   Study design: We performed a retrospective cohort study of all first trimester surgical abortions with moderate intravenous sedation at an outpatient facility between September 2010 and June 2015. The primary outcome was supplemental oxygen administration. Secondary outcomes included reversal agent administration, anesthesia-related adverse events, and intraoperative lowest level of consciousness (LLOC). We compared three obesity groups [I (Body Mass Index, BMI=30-34.9), II (BMI=35-39.9), and III (BMI >= 40)] to normal weight women (BMI <25). We exported data from electronic medical records and reviewed adverse outcomes individually.
   Results: Of 20,381 first trimester surgical abortion procedures, 31 (0.15%) utilized supplemental oxygen, 24 (0.12%) utilized a reversal agent, 40 (0.20%) had a presumed anesthesia-related adverse event and 184 of 19,725 (0.93%).had a documented low intraoperative LLOC. One patient (0.005%) required hospital transfer or hospitalization. Supplemental oxygen administration (obesity versus normal weight: obese I, aOR 0.52, 95% CI 0.12-2.27; II/M, aOR 1.51, 95% CI 0.50-4.54), low intraoperative LLOC, and anesthesia-related adverse events were not associated with obesity. The rate of reversal agent administration was lower among obese I, II and III women combined compared to normal weight women (aOR 0.13, 95% CI 0.02-0.96).
   Conclusions: Adverse outcomes were rare across all BMI categories with no detectable increased risk among obese women compared to normal weight women. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

ID KNOWLEDGE; PROVIDERS
AB Objectives: Recent programmatic and research efforts on addressing gaps in health systems of low-income countries increasingly see task shifting, i.e. the provision of healthcare by non-medically trained personnel, as a possible solution to increase the availability of specific services and commodities. In Kinshasa, private-sector pharmacies are the primary and preferred provider of family planning (FP) methods, and thus constitute a potential resource for expanding access to specific contraceptives. The objective of this study is to explore selected pharmacies' readiness to serve women seeking emergency contraception (EC).
   Study design: This study used a mystery client (MC) methodology to visit 73 pharmacies in Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). Trained interviewers posed as novice EC users and asked specific questions to evaluate the pharmacy staff's technical knowledge of EC and their attitudes towards EC clients. The results of the MC visit were recorded immediately after the MC left the pharmacy.
   Results: Findings indicate that more than two-thirds of EC providers were knowledgeable about EC dosage, timeframe, and side effects, and 90% were deemed helpful towards novice EC users. Rare but glaring misconceptions about EC timeframe (20% of providers) and long-term side effects (4% of providers), as well as frequent stock-out (22%) and cost issues highlight priorities for programmatic improvements.
   Conclusions: As new service delivery strategies are explored to complement the uneven network of health structures in DRC, this study suggests that, given proper training and integration in FP programming, private-sector pharmacies have the potential to meet specific contraceptive needs for women living in Kinshasa.

AB Objective: We modeled the potential impact of novel male contraceptive methods on averting unintended pregnancies in the United States, South Africa, and Nigeria.
   Study design: We used an established methodology for calculating the number of couple-years of protection provided by a given contraceptive method mix. We compared a "current scenario" (reflecting current use of existing methods in each country) against "future scenarios," (reflecting whether a male oral pill or a reversible vas occlusion was introduced) in order to estimate the impact on unintended pregnancies averted. Where possible, we based our assumptions on acceptability data from studies on uptake of novel male contraceptive methods.
   Results: Assuming that only 10% of interested men would take up a novel male method and that users would comprise both switchers (from existing methods) and brand-new users of contraception, the model estimated that introducing the male pill or reversible vas occlusion would decrease unintended pregnancies by 3.5% to 5.2% in the United States, by 3.2% to 5% in South Africa, and by 30.4% to 38% in Nigeria. Alternative model scenarios are presented assuming uptake as high as 15% and as low as 5% in each location. Model results were sensitive to assumptions regarding novel method uptake and proportion of switchers vs. new users.
   Conclusion: Even under conservative assumptions, the introduction of a male pill or temporary vas occlusion could meaningfully contribute to averting unintended pregnancies in a variety of contexts, especially in settings where current use of contraception is low.

AB Objective: The objective was to determine if young women initiating long-acting reversible contraceptives (LARCs) who report new sexual partner(s) would be less likely to report use of a condom than women using short-acting reversible contraceptive (SARC) methods.
   Study design: We enrolled a prospective cohort of 13-24-year-old women attending an adolescent-specific contraception clinic. Participants completed questionnaires at the contraceptive initiation visit and 6 months later. At follow-up, we asked if they had sexual intercourse with a new partner, if they had used condoms, if their condom use patterns had changed and why. We analyzed factors associated with condom use.
   Results: We enrolled 1048 women; 771 (73.6%) initiated LARC and 384 (36.6%) initiated SARC. At 6 months, 508 participants (48.5%) completed the follow-up survey: 380 LARC initiators and 128 SARC initiators. Approximately 23% of LARC initiators and 27% of SARC initiators reported a new partner. SARC initiators who had a new partner were more likely to report condom use at least one time than LARC initiators reporting a new partner [82.4% vs. 59.6%; odds ratio (OR): 3.17, 95% confidence interval (Cl): 1.19-8.43]. Such condom use was 42% higher among LARC initiators who reported a new sexual partner than those without and 38% higher for SARC initiators. In multivariable logistic regression, new sexual partner [adjusted OR (aOR) 3.29, 95% CI 2.10-5.16], SARC initiation (aOR 2.08, 95% CI 1.35-3.22) and age <20 (aOR 1.68, 95% CI 1.14-2.49) were independent predictors of condom use.
   Conclusion: While young women are less likely to report condom use in the 6 months after initiating a LARC than after initiating a short-acting method, both groups increase their condom use similarly if they report a new sexual partner. Implications: The differential in condom use between LARC initiators and SARC initiators is likely related to their perceived need for pregnancy prevention, as both groups increase their condom use similarly if they had new sexual partners.

AB Objective: This study examined whether women with Medicaid are less likely to receive long-acting reversible contraception (LARC) in a clinic requiring two visits for insertion.
   Study design: LARC insertion and pregnancy rates were compared among women with Medicaid vs. private insurance, along with other predictors, in a retrospective chart review (N=447).
   Results: Univariately, fewer women with Medicaid vs. private insurance received LARC (66% vs. 79%, p<.01) and more become pregnant (18% vs. 6%, p<.001). Significant multivariate predictors of not receiving LARC were being unmarried and postpartum, both of which were associated with having Medicaid.
   Conclusion: Women with Medicaid are less likely than women with private insurance to have a requested LARC device inserted when a clinic requires two visits for insertion. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB We use the discrete solvent reaction field model to evaluate the linear and second-order nonlinear optical susceptibilities of 3-methyl-4-nitropyridine-1-oxyde crystal. In this approach, crystal environment is created by supercell architecture. A self-consistent procedure is used to obtain charges and polarizabilities for environmental atoms. Impact of atomic polarizabilities on the properties of interest is highlighted. This approach is shown to give the second-order nonlinear optical susceptibilities within error bar of experiment as well as the linear optical susceptibilities in the same order as experiment. Similar quality of calculations are also applied to both 4-N, N-dimethylamino-3-acetamidonitrobenzene and 2-methyl-4-nitroaniline crystals. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Markov state models (MSMs) are a powerful approach for analyzing the long-time behaviors of protein motion using molecular dynamics simulation data. However, their quantitative performance with respect to the physical quantities is poor. We believe that this poor performance is caused by the failure to appropriately classify protein conformations into states when constructing MSMs. Herein, we show that the quantitative performance of an order parameter is improved when a manifold-learning technique is employed for the classification in the MSM. The MSM construction using the K-center method, which has been previously used for classification, has a poor quantitative performance. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID CARBON-DIOXIDE; VISIBLE-LIGHT; PHOTOREDUCTION
AB In view of the great importance of finding ways to reduce CO2 by using solar energy, we have examined the advantage of employing heterostructures containing bimetallic alloys for the purpose. This choice is based on the knowledge that metals such as Pt reduce CO2, although the activity may not be considerable. Our studies on the reduction of CO2 by ZnO/M/CdS (M = Ag, Au, Ag1-xAux, Ag1-xCux) heterostructures in liquid phase have shown good results specially in the case of ZnO/Ag1-xCux/CdS, reaching a CO production activity of 327.4 mu mol h(1) g(1). The heterostructures also reduce CO2 in the gas-phase although the production activity is not high. Some of the heterostructures exhibit reduction of CO2 even in the absence of a sacrificial reagent.

AB The absorption spectra in a large range of concentrations show that the reactions of iodate with iodine in 96% sulfuric acid produce (IO) HSO4, I-3(+) and I-5(+), just like in the pure 100% acid. We discovered that, in 96% H2SO4, these reactions also produce I2O which is not formed in the pure acid.

AB The (H2Cl+)-Cl-35 Ar cation complex was prepared by electrical discharge in a supersonic expansion of argon doped with HCl and hydrogen. The ion was mass selected in a reflectron time-of-flight spectrometer and investigated with infrared photodissociation spectroscopy in the regions of 1000-4550 and 4850-7350 cm(-1). Anharmonic vibrational frequencies were computed with VPT2 at the CCSD(T)/cc-pVTZ level of theory. The previously unreported V-3 fundamental at 2211 cm(-1) and several new combinations and overtones are reported. VPT2 theory at this level confirms the H-bound structure of the complex and provides an accurate description of the anharmonic vibrations in this system. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The yields of H atoms in the thermal decomposition of i-C4H10 -> products (1) and n-C4H10 -> products (2) are measured at 1470-1800 K behind reflected shock waves. A comparative method is used to evaluate the branching fractions for i-C4H10 -> CH3 + i-C3H7 (1a) and n-C4H10 -> 2C(2)H(5) (2b), where, C3H6 is used as a reference. The branching fractions for (1a) and (2b) are expressed by k(1a)/ k(1) = (0.64 +/- 0.14) (10 T-3/ K) - (0.06 +/- 0.23) and, k(2b)/ k(2) = (0.050 +/- 0.059)(10 T-3/ K) + (0.49 +/- 0.10), respectively.

AB We performed density functional theory based calculations on Si-60 cage and analyzed the effect the substitution of single Al or P atom. We have explored and compared various electronic properties of Si-60, Si59Al and Si59P cages. The density-of-state curves reveal that the substitution of Al (or P) creates additional energy level such that the frontier orbital gap is decreased, increasing its conductivity. The lower ionization energy of Si59Al and higher electron affinity of Si59P suggest the easy injection of holes and electrons, respectively. These findings clearly demonstrate that Si-nanoclusters mimic the properties of their bulk analogues. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Structural relaxation and stability of a Bi18-cluster as obtained from association of [Bi6O4(OH)(4)](NO3)(6) precursor clusters in DMSO solution is investigated from a combination of quantum chemical calculations and mu s-scale molecular dynamics simulations using empirical interaction potentials. The Bi18-cluster undergoes a OH center dot center dot center dot OH proton transfer reaction, followed by considerable structural relaxation. While the aggregation of the Bi18-cluster is induced by the dissociation of a single nitrate ion leading to [Bi6O4(OH)(4)](NO3)(5)(+) as an activated precursor species that can bind two more Bi6-clusters, we find the [Bi18O13(OH)(10)](NO3)(18+x)(+x) species (explored for x = 1-6) rather inert against either nitrate dissociation, collision with Bi6-precursors or combinations thereof.

AB The multi-state density functional theory (MSDFT) provides a convenient way to estimate electronic coupling of charge transfer processes based on a diabatic representation. Its performance has been benchmarked against the HAB11 database with a mean unsigned error (MUE) of 17 meV between MSDFT and ab initio methods. The small difference may be attributed to different representations, diabatic from MSDFT and adiabatic from ab initio calculations. In this discussion, we conclude that MSDFT provides a general and efficient way to estimate the electronic coupling for charge-transfer rate calculations based on the Marcus-Hush model.

AB The crystal structure, lattice dynamics and themomechanical properties of bulk monoclinic zirconium tetrachloride (ZrCl4) have been investigated using zero-damping dispersion-corrected density functional theory [DFT-D3(zero)]. Phonon analysis reveals that ZrCl4(cr) undergoes negative thermal expansion (NTE) near T approximate to 10 K, with a coefficient of thermal expansion of alpha = -1.2 ppm K-1 and a Gruneisen parameter of gamma = -1.1. The bulk modulus is predicted to vary from K-0 = 8.7 to 7.0 GPa in the temperature range 0-550 K. The isobaric molar heat capacity derived from phonon calculations within the quasi-harmonic approximation is in fair agreement with existing calorimetric data. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB N-p-tolyl-5-oxo pyrrolidine-3-carboxylic acid (TOPCA) was synthesized by Michael addition-cyclo condensation. The molecular structure of TOPCA was optimized by B3LYP method with 6-311G(d, p) and aug-cc-pVDZ (Dunning) basis sets as well as CAM-B3LYP method with 6-311G(d, p) basis set. In addition, MEP, CHELPG and NBO analyses were carried out to understand the influence of hydrogen bonding interactions. The molecular structure of TOPCA is governed by intramolecular hydrogen bonding interactions (C-H center dot center dot center dot O) which influence charge transfer in TOPCA. The C-H center dot center dot center dot O interactions stimulate the emission property of TOPCA excited at 380 nm. Intramolecular H-bonding and charge transfer induce the second hyperpolarizability in TOPCA. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Hydrogenated Fe doped amorphous carbon is synthesized via mechanically alloying. XANES analysis suggests that Fe is considered to bond with either C or H atom where the first principle calculations reveals that two types of H-C bonding is confirmed. Weak H-C bond is observed near Fe atom while strong H-C bond is seen far from Fe atom. Electronic structure discovered that weak H-C bonding is induced by Fe atoms where Fe form ionic like bond with surrounding C, resulting in the weak H-C interaction. Thus, two different types of H-C bonding is confirmed within Fe doped amorphous carbon. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB We report first-principle based studies of the adsorption interaction of astatine species on a gold surface. These studies are aimed primarily at the support and interpretation of gas chromatographic experiments with superheavy elements, tennessine (Ts, Z = 117), a heavier homologue of At, and possibly its pseudo-homologue nihonium (Nh, Z = 113). We use gold clusters with up to 69 atoms to simulate the adsorption sites and estimate the desorption energies of At & AtOH from a stable gold (111) surface. To describe the electronic structure of At - Au-n and AtOH - Aun complexes, we combine accurate shape-consistent relativistic pseudopotentials and non-collinear two-component relativistic density functional theory. The predicted desorption energies of At and AtOH on gold are 130 +/- 10 kJ/mol and 90 +/- 10 kJ/mol, respectively. These results confirm the validity of the estimates derived from chromatographic data (147 +/- 15 kJ/mol for At, and 100(-10)(+20) kJ/mol for AtOH). (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The dissociation of O-2 and HO2 are important reactions that occur at the cathode of fuel cells producing H2O and use platinum as a catalyst. There is a need to replace platinum with less expensive catalysts. Here the possibility of boron nanostructures as catalysts for the reactions is considered using density functional theory. The calculations show that the bond dissociation energies to remove O and OH from O-2 and O2H bonded to boron nanostructures are less than those necessary to dissociate free O-2 and O2H indicating that some of the boron nanostructures could be catalysts for the dissociation of O-2 and HO2.

AB Platinum plate method based on Wilhel my plate was used to measure the surface tension of hydrophilic nano-titanium dioxide-deionized water (nano-TiO2-DIW) fluids and hydrophilic lipophilic nano-TiO2-DIW fluids. Experimental results show that the surface adsorption of hydrophilic lipophilic nano-TiO2 is positive adsorption, and hydrophilic nano-TiO2 is negative adsorption. The hydrophilic nano-TiO2 in deionized water increases the surface tension of base fluid, and hydrophilic lipophilic nano-TiO2 in deionized water decreases. The surface tension of hydrophilic TiO2-DIW nanofluids increases, and hydrophilic lipophilic TiO2-DIW nanofluids decreases linearly with an increase in the natural logarithm of the molar concentration of nanofluids.

AB The effect of H2O2 treatment on the surface properties of SiO2 is studied. H2O2 treatment leads to the formation of Si(AOH)(x) at the SiO2 surface that serves to reduce the number of trap states, inducing the shift of the Fermi level toward the conduction band minimum. H2O2 treatment also leads to a noticeable reduction in the value of the SiO2 capacitance per unit area. The effect of SiO2 layers with H2O2 treatment on the behavior of carrier transports for the pentacene/SiO2-based organic thin-film transistor (OTFT) is also studied. Experimental identification confirms that the shift of the threshold voltage towards negative gate-source voltages is due to the reduced number of trap states in SiO2 near the pentacene/SiO2 interface. The existence of a hydrogenated layer between pentacene and SiO2 leads to a change in the pentacene-SiO2 interaction, increasing the value of the carrier mobility. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

The resultant material (Fe3O4@MCM-41-Im@MnPor) was characterized by X-ray diffractometry (XRD), Fourier transform infra-red (FT-IR), diffuse reflectance UV-Vis spectrophotometry (DR UV-Vis), field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), Inductively coupled plasma (ICP), analyzer transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area. This new heterogenized catalyst was applied as an efficient catalyst for the epoxidation of a variety of cyclic and linear olefins with NaIO4 under mild conditions. The prepared catalyst can be easily recovered through the application of an external magnet, and reused several times without any significant decrease in activity and magnetic properties.

AB Despite the potential applications and ubiquity of clathrate hydrates, the molecular mechanism of formation of these compounds is not yet well-understood. In this work, the formation mechanism of the face-sharing double cages in structure-I hydrate was studied by density functional theory calculations, which is responsible to the hydrate nucleation and growth. The results show that the clathrate cages favor to form one after another, and the 512 cages are thermodynamically feasible in the beginning. The water-water and water-methane interactions mostly dominate the formation of the clathrate cages, while the methane-methane interactions have little effect on the formation process.

These three interactions, characterized by their strongest component, are: intermolecular double H-bonds along the molecular axis, London dispersion interaction of hexyl chains connecting these linear assemblies, and p-p stacking of the aromatic rings perpendicular to the molecular planes. On heating, two transitions happen, disordering of hexyl chains at 473 K, followed by H-bond melting at 534 K. The nature of the bonds and transitions was established by matrix-isolation and temperature-dependent infrared spectroscopy and supported by theoretical computations. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB In the present work, absolute hydration enthalpies are calculated from ion absolute hardness for a series of +1 and -1 ions. The calculated values are compared with those previously reported (Housecroft, 2017) [2] and relationships between V-m(-1/3) and absolute hardness are stablished. The following empirical equations have been derived, for cations and anions, respectively: Delta H-hyd degrees = -(9.645 eta(+) + 245.930) and Delta H-hyd degrees = -(64.601 eta(-) + 12.321). In such equations, eta(+) and eta(-) are the absolute hardness. It is shown that for d block monocations (Cu+, Ag+ and Au+), hydration enthalpy is closely related with Clementi effective nuclear charge by the equation: Delta H-hyd degrees = -(9.645 eta(+) + 245.930) (Z(eff)/(n - 1)), where n is the main quantum number. Furthermore, is shown that a typical VBT parameter (V-m(-1/3)) is related with eta(+) and eta(-) values and so, with the energies of the frontier orbitals, that is, is stablished a direct relationship between a structural parameter available by X-ray data and the energy of atomic/molecular orbitals.

AB Density functional theory calculations are performed to study the healing mechanism of single-vacancy defects in zigzag (n,0) CNTs by NO molecule (n = 6,8,10). The results indicate that the healing process proceeds through a two-step mechanism. First, NO molecule adsorbs over the defective site. Then, the extra oxygen atom (O-ads) is eliminated by three different ways: (i) NO + O-ads -> NO2, (ii) CO + O-ads -> CO2, or (iii) SO2 + O-ads -> SO3. The dependency of the healing process on the tube diameter is studied in detail. The results of this work suggest a novel approach to achieve N-doped CNTs. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this paper, based on full potential density functional theory calculations, the electronic and optical properties of aluminium and gallium phosphide (AlP and GaP) graphene-like structures are investigated under different biaxial compressive and tensile strain loads. One of the fascinating properties of these new monolayers is their high stretch-ability and high mechanosensitivity of their electronic and optical features. The electronic calculations display that the energy gap of materials versus the exerted strain can be estimated by a second order polynomial equation. Furthermore, the optical calculations indicate that the electronic and optical gap of AlP and GaP monolayers can be tuned by biaxial strain loads. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Due to difficulties in obtaining complexes as monocrystals the combination of laboratory based methods with X-ray absorption spectroscopy supported with density functional theory calculations has been employed. Complexes were found to be mono-and dinuclear. Different coordination modes were also observed: monodentate, bidentate chelating and carboxylate bridges. The octahedral geometry was found for complex with 2-carboxylic acid whereas for the other two the tetragonal pyramid was formed around copper cations. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

CuO and ZnO nanoparticles (NPs) supported mesoporous silica were synthesized using impregnation method. The structural properties of these materials were investigated using several characterization techniques such as FTIR, XRD, SAXS, TEM and TGA. SAXS and TEM confirmed that the obtained mesoporous silica is based on the EO/PO ratio of Pluronic surfactants. They proved that the mesoporosity of silica is well maintained even after they loaded with metal oxide nanoparticles. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Here, we studied the charge-carrier modulation of single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) via poly (vinyl acetate) (PVAc) doping and dedoping under ultraviolet (UV) light irradiation with the aim of pairing several p- and n-type SWCNTs as thermoelectric (TE) elements. The Seebeck coefficient of the SWCNTs was first made negative by doping with PVAc and then made positive again through UV-induced PVAc dedoping. A possible TE module configuration and the process for its fabrication are proposed, wherein prints and photopatterns can be obtained without the use of additional electrodes. Our findings enable the fabrication of fine TE modules using simple materials and techniques. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Semiconductor photonic crystals (MSPhC) were used to convert solar energy into hot electrons. An experimental model was designed by using metallic semiconductor photonic crystals (MSPhC). The designed MSPhC is based on TiO2/Au schottky contact. The model has similar nanocavity structure for broad gold absorption, but the materials on top of the cavity were changed to a metal and a semiconductor in order to collect the hot electrons. Detailed design steps and characterization have shown a broadband subbandgap photoresponse at a wavelength of 590 nm. This is due to the surface plasmon absorption by the wafer-scale Au/TiO2 metallic-semiconductor photonic crystal. Analytical calculation of the hot electron transport from the Au thin layer to the TiO2 conduction band is discussed. This theoretical study is based on the quantum tunneling effect. The photo generation of the hot electrons was undertaken at different wavelengths in Au absorber followed by tunneling through a schottky barrier into a TiO2 collector. The presence of a tunnel current from the absorber to the collector under illumination, offers a method to extract carriers from a hot-electron distribution at few bias voltages is presented in this study. The effects of doping different concentrations of the semiconductor on the evolution of the current characteristics were also investigated and discussed. The electrical characteristics were found to be sensitive to any change in the thickness of the barrier. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Open edge BN boron-nitride has a stable graphene-like structure, which could be doped by a range of impurities, so the band gap could be tuned. The optical, electrical, physicochemical properties, NBO and electron density of open edge BN that is doped by Yttrium was evaluated using DFT method as a sensor for He gas. Here, was applied HSE1PBE method exchange correlation and LANL2DZ. The density of states and natural bond orbital analysis calculated have depicted that the band gap of BN-Y flake after sensing He gas and it has shown change from 1.66 -> 2.42 eV. The UV-Vis absorption in lambda(max) area showed a significant red-shift that it is an appropriate parameter to recognize He molecule. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB New nanocomposites based on transition metal dichalcogenides, MoWCoS and MoWCuS, were synthesized through one step hydrothermal method. X-ray diffraction (XRD) and energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) techniques as well as field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images confirmed the synthesis of nanocomposites. For investigation of hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) properties of new nanocomposites, linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) was applied for this purpose. According to the results of similar previous works, the prepared nanocomposites showed promising HER properties as low overpotential equal to 41.4 mV/dec for MoWCoS hybridized with reduced graphene (G) and a little higher one equal to 49 mV/dec for MoWCuS hybridized with reduced graphene. Based on obtained Tafel slopes 38 and 53 mV/dec for MoWCoS/G and MoWCuS/G, respectively, the "Heyrovsky-Volmer" mechanism was suggested for the new HER three component nanocatalysts as the first effort to this purpose.

The photoionization efficiency curves (PIE) of the subliming product molecules were collected and allowed for detection of three class of products containing chlorine, nitrogen, and oxygen including atoms and free radicals. These results suggest a new insight into possible low-temperature decomposition pathways of NH4ClO4. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Together with previous measurements at room temperature, the results cover a range of collision energies (epsilon = 10-130 meV). Differences in the mobilities of the isomers became pronounced at low collision energies; for example, (n-BuOH) Li+ showed a mobility about 5% greater than (t-BuOH) Li+ at 10 meV.

Perylene nanoparticles with diameters of several hundred nm were formed by the laser irradiation only when Triton X-100 was added in the solutions at sufficiently high concentrations of the surfactant. The transfer of perylene molecules into the micelles of Triton X-100 was avoided by optimizing the concentrations of the surfactant so that only perylene nanoparticles were obtained in the aqueous solutions.

AB Single-molecule force spectroscopy by atomic force microscopy allows us to get insight into the mechanical unfolding of membrane proteins, and a typical experiment exhibits characteristic patterns on the force distance curves. The origin of these patterns, however, has not been fully understood yet. We performed coarse-grained simulation of the forced unfolding of halorodopsin, reproduced the characteristic features of the experimental force distance curves. A further examination near the membrane-water interface indicated the existence of a motif for the force peak formation, i.e., the occurrence of hydrophobic residues in the upper interface region and hydrophilic residues below the lower interface region.

In-situ Brewster Angle Microscopic (BAM) studies showed distinct domain structures of complex and hybrid Langmuir monolayer at the air-water interface. UV-vis absorption spectra showed non-fluorescent H-dimeric band in concentrated aqueous solution of NBC and in complex LB film of NBC with stearic acid. By changing various parameters, a great control over H-dimeric states has been achieved in clay incorporated hybrid LB films. These films can act as efficient fluorescence probe.

The results indicate that despite differences in the total interactions energy (DFT + corrections) versus SAPT0 results, the sequence of contributions of the individual dispersion terms is still maintained. Both dispersion corrections perform similarly and they improve the results suggesting that it is worthwhile to include them in calculations. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Mn and Bi nanoparticles were synthesized by a wet chemistry reduction process. The as-synthesized Mn and Bi nanoparticles were mixed in hexane with the molar ratio of 1 to 1, and annealed at 250 degrees C in an inert gas environment. In four parallel experiments, the annealing time was controlled to be 2, 4, 6, and 8 h. The impacts of annealing time on product morphology, crystallization, and magnetic properties were investigated. The results showed that within 6 h annealing, an increased annealing time resulted in more sintering among the particles in the products, enhanced crystallization, and improved magnetic properties. When the annealing time exceeded 6 h, further annealing did not bring much difference in morphology, crystallization, and magnetic properties, indicating a thermally stable state of the product.

AB Density functional and Moller-Plesset perturbation approaches were applied to charge-remote fragmentation along the reaction coordinate of 1,4-hydrogen eliminations in the gas-phase. The mechanisms and energy barriers of the reactions are discussed. The calculations indicate that 1,4-hydrogen elimination via an aromatic-like six-atom transition state structure is energetically favorable with no involvement of the charge site. Cleavage of C-C and C-H bonds and the formation of H-H bonds occur simultaneously, and the energy barrier of this reaction is 4.01 eV. Energy decomposition analysis predicts a repulsive interaction between the formed H-2 and the remaining substituents. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The structural, electronic and photocatalytic properties of five vacancy-containing 2D BiI3 monolayers are investigated by the first-principle calculations. The electronic structures show that the five structures are stable and have comparable binding energies to that of the pristine BiI3 monolayer, and the defects can tune the band gaps. Optical spectra indicate that the five structures retain high absorption capacity for visible light. The spin-orbit coupling (SOC) effect is found to play an important role in the band edge of defective structures, and the V-Bi and VBi-I3 defective BiI3 monolayers can make absolute band edges straddle water redox potentials more easily.

AB Understanding the nature of pi-electron density is important to characterize the conjugate pi molecular systems. In this work, the pi-electron densities of some typical conjugated pi molecular systems were separated from their total electron densities; the positions and natures of non-nuclear (3, -3) pi-attractors and the pi-bond critical points (pi-BCPs) are investigated. The calculated results show that for the same element, the position of the pi-attractor is constant, regardless of the chemical surroundings. The position of the pi-BCP is closer to the atom with the larger electronegativity. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Application of carbon nanotube (CNT) film as a gas sensor is highly desired. Transient behavior of molecular adsorption provides adsorption and desorption constants; however, to date, few researchers have investigated it. Here, we focused on the transient behavior of electric conductance of the CNT film during adsorption. Adsorption of polar molecules showed predicable behavior, but non-polar molecules showed a sudden change of electric conductance that indicated excess adsorption. We analyzed the process based on Langmuir adsorption, and adsorption and desorption constants, which are considered to be physical properties; however, these parameters did not show good agreement for the same film.

AB With a view to investigate the influence of nanosize on the magnetocaloric properties of the La0.67Sr0.33MnO3 nanoparticles, a systematic investigation of their temperature-dependant magnetic entropy change has been undertaken. The maximum of magnetic entropy change -Delta S-M(max) and the relative cooling power (RCP) decrease with decreasing particle size. As a result the magnetocaloric effect was greatly changed by the particle size. Indeed, the relative cooling power can be tuned dramatically by particle size. Moreover, the nature of phase transition has been determined using Banerjee's criterion plots and confirmed by the construction of the universal curve of the magnetic entropy change.

AB In this research, the influence of ionic liquid on the conversion efficiency, incident photons to converted electrons (IPCE) and performance of fabricated solar cell was investigated using various ionic liquids. Ionic liquids with different substituents and ions were prepared and used as redox mediators in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). Ionic liquids were characterized H-1 and C-13 NMR spectra. We practically investigated the performance of ionic liquid salts were used as the mobile ions and found that the efficiencies of DSSCs were increased up to 40% comparing commercial electrolyte system. The ionic liquid compounds were incorporated in DSSCs to obtain an efficient charge transfer, solving the corrosion problem of platinum layer in counter electrode compared to commercial electrolyte.

Density functional theory (DFT) and Time dependent DFT (TDDFT) calculations are carried out on complexes of PDI and PMI with aniline in THF solution. The optimized geometries for the complexes have aniline lying parallel above the perylene at 3.15 angstrom and with binding energy of 0.53 eV in the ground state. The results on the excited states are consistent with a photoinduced electron transfer (PET) mechanism. The effective aniline-perylene distance resulting from a Mulliken's approach is 3.61 angstrom.

AB The Shannon entropy in the atomic, molecular and chemical physics context is presented by using as test cases the hydrogenic-like atoms H-c, He-c(+) and Li-c(2) confined by an impenetrable spherical box. Novel expressions for entropic uncertainty relation and Shannon entropies S-r and S-p are proposed to ensure their physical dimensionless characteristic. The electronic ground state energy and the quantities S-r; S-p and S-t are calculated for the hydrogenic-like atoms to different confinement radii by using a variational method. The global behavior of these quantities and different conjectures are analyzed. The results are compared, when available, with those previously published. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB N-doped TiO2 nanoparticles deposited on reduced graphene oxide sheets were successfully prepared by a photoreduction method. The synthesized N-TiO2/rGO composite was characterized by XRD, SERS, XPS, TEM, UV-vis DRS and PL, and its visible-light photocatalytic activity was evaluated by degradation of tetracycline hydrochloride (TC). The results showed that N-TiO2/rGO composites exhibited a more enhanced photodegradation activity compared to pure TiO2 and N-doped TiO2. Trapping tests indicated that not (OH)-O-center dot and h(+) but O-center dot(2) was chiefly responsible for the photodegradation process. The reusable experiments showed that the prepared N-TiO2/rGO catalyst was stable during the photodegradation of TC. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB this letter, a possible reason behind selective host-guest organization in the initial stage of sI methane hydrate nucleation is provided, through density functional theory based calculations. In doing so, we have connected earlier experimental and theoretical observations on the structure and energetics of sI methane hydrate to our findings. Geometry and relative stability of small (H2O)(5) and (H2O)(6) clusters, presence of CH4 guest, integrity and cavity radius of (H2O)(20) and (H2O)(24), as well as the weak van der Waals type of forces, particularly dispersion interaction, are major factors responsible for initial formation of methane encapsulated dodecahedron cavity over tetrakaidecahedron.

AB Three reactions occurring on the C3H4Cl potential energy surface ( PES) were studied computationally using quantum chemistry and master equation/RRKM: CH2Cl + C2H2 -> Products (1), CH2CHCHCl -> Products (2), and CH2ClCHCH -> Products (3). The results indicate low importance of the 1,3-Cl shift channel linking the PESs of reactions 1 and 2 despite a relatively low energy barrier. Addition and chemically activated H elimination are the two major products of reaction 1, with branching dependent on pressure and temperature. Cl and cyclopropene are the major products of reaction 2, and CH2Cl + C2H2 - of reaction 3. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this work we have developed an analytical procedure to identify metal ion coordination geometries in liquid media based on the calculation of Combined Distribution Functions (CDFs) starting from Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations. CDFs provide a fingerprint which can be easily and unambiguously assigned to a reference polyhedron. The CDF analysis has been tested on five systems and has proven to reliably identify the correct geometries of several ion coordination complexes. This tool is simple and general and can be efficiently applied to different MD simulations of liquid systems. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The modified method has excellent operability and expandability in preparing perovskite solar cells. The CH3NH3I treatment temperature is 130 degrees C or 150 degrees C in conventional method, but we reduced the temperature to 70 degrees C in the modified vapor-assisted method. Meanwhile, the quality of CH3NH3PbI3 films prepared via the modified method is superior to that of CH3NH3PbI3 films of solution-processed method. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Fisher information (I) is investigated for confined hydrogen atom (CHA)-like systems in conjugate r and p spaces. A comparative study between CHA and free H atom (with respect to I) is pursued. A detailed systematic result of I with respect to variation of confinement radius r(c) is presented, with particular emphasis on non-zero-(l, m) mthorn states. In certain respect, inferences in CHA are significantly different from free counterpart, such as (i) dependence on n, l quantum numbers (ii) appearance of maxima in I-p plots for vertical bar m vertical bar not equal 0. The role of atomic number and atomic radius is discussed. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB TNF (tumor necrosis factor) is both a pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokine that is central to the development of autoimmune disease, cancer, and protection against infectious pathogens. As well as a myriad other activities, TNF can be a product of T cells and can act on T cells. Here we review old and new data on the importance of TNF produced by T cells and how TNF signaling via TNFR2 may directly impact alternate aspects of T cell biology. TNF can promote the activation and proliferation of nave and effector T cells, but also can induce apoptosis of highly activated effector T cells, further determining the size of the pathogenic or protective conventional T cell pool. Moreover, TNF can have divergent effects on regulatory T cells. It can both downregulate their suppressive capacity, but also contribute in other instances to their development or accumulation. Biologics that block TNF or stimulate TNFR2 therefore have the potential to strongly modulate the balance between effector T cells and Treg cells which could impact disease in both positive and negative manners.

Much of the pro- inflammatory action of TNF-alpha is mediated by TNFR1 whereas TNFR2 is thought to play an immunoregulatory and tissue protective role. Anti-TNF-alpha biologics have been extremely successful in treating a number of immune mediated pathologies, including rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease. However, anti-TNF therapy has been shown to induce systemic lupus erythematosus and psoriasis in some patients, and to be deleterious in multiple sclerosis. It is hypothesized that these paradoxical effects of anti-TNF-alpha are due to inhibition of TNFR2 signalling. In this review, we will focus on the biology and pathophysiologic role of TNF-alpha and on the therapeutic implications of targeting TNF-alpha receptor signalling. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Cytokines are involved in a wide range of functions shaping the normal immune response, yet inflammatory changes in the immune system due to dysregulated cytokine signaling may lead to the induction of autoimmunity. Cytokine inhibitors have revolutionized the treatment of many autoimmune diseases in recent years. Systemic cytokine ablation, however, is often associated with the development of adverse side effects and some patients simply do not respond to therapy. TNF, IL-1 and IL-6 are the best characterized proinflammatory cytokines considered as the main therapeutic targets for the treatment of several autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. But can anti-cytokine therapy become more selective and thus more efficient? This mini-review discusses several recently emerging paradigms and summarizes current experimental attempts to validate them in mouse studies. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Lymphotoxin (LT) is a member of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) superfamily of cytokines which serves multiple functions, including the control of lymphoid organ development and maintenance, as well as regulation of inflammation and autoimmunity. Although the role of LT in organogenesis and maintenance of lymphoid organs is well established, the contribution of LT pathway to homeostasis of lymphoid organs during the immune response to pathogens is less understood. In this review, we highlight recent advances on the role of LT pathway in antiviral immune responses. We discuss the role of LT signaling in lymphoid organ integrity, type I IFN production and regulation of protection and immunopathology during viral infections. We further discuss the potential of therapeutic targeting LT pathway for controlling immunopathology and antiviral protection. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Therapy by blocking tumor necrosis factor (TNF) activity is highly efficacious and profoundly changed the paradigm of several inflammatory diseases. However, a significant proportion of patients with inflammatory diseases do not respond to TNF inhibitors (TNFi). Prediction of therapeutic response is required for TNFi therapy. Isotope labeled anti-TNF antibodies or TNF receptor have been investigated to localize TNF production at inflammatory tissue in animal models and in patients with inflammatory diseases. The in vivo detection of TNF has been associated with treatment response. Recently, fluorophore labeled anti-TNF antibody in combination with confocal laser endomicroscopy in patients with Crohn's disease yielded more accurate and quantitative in vivo detection of TNF in the diseased mucosa. More importantly, this method demonstrated high therapeutic predication value. Fluorophore labeled TNF binding aptamers in combination with modern imaging technology offers additional tools for in vivo TNF probing. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Patients treated with the TNF antagonist adalimumab develop anti-therapeutic antibodies (ATA), the prevalence of which varies depending on the assay used. Most assays are compromised due to the presence of adalimumab in the clinical samples. Our objective was to develop an antibody assay, applicable for clinical testing, which overcomes the limitation of therapeutic interference and to further determine the relationship between ATA development, adalimumab levels and disease activity in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), psoriatic arthritis (PsA) or ankylosing spondylitis (AS). Use of an electrochemiluminescence platform permitted development of fit-for-purpose immunoassays. Serum samples from patients, taken prior to and at 12 and 24 weeks of treatment, were retrospectively analysed for levels of adalimumab and ATA. Overall, the antibody prevalence was 43.6% at 12 weeks and 41% at 24 weeks of treatment. Disruption of immune complexes by acid dissociation, a strategy often adopted for this purpose, only marginally increased the antibody prevalence to 48.7% and 46% at 12 and 24 weeks respectively. We found that antibody formation was associated with decreasing levels of circulating adalimumab, but no direct effect on disease activity was evident as assessed using DAS28 for RA patients and BASDAI for PsA and AS patients. However, a negative correlation of free adalimumab trough levels with disease activity scores was observed. Data showed that adalimumab levels can serve as an indicator of ATA development which can then be confirmed by ATA testing. Monitoring of both therapeutic and antibodies should be considered during adalimumab therapy to allow clinicians to personalise treatments for maximal therapeutic outcomes.

AB Inhibition of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) activity has profoundly changed the management of several immune-mediated inflammatory diseases with great benefit for patients. The application of TNF inhibitors (TNFi), however, also brings a new concern, malignancy. We performed a systemic review to collect the studies reporting cancer incidences and risks in TNFi users regardless of indications. TNFi were most frequently used in treating patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). In RA patients without prior cancer history, the incidences of malignancies ranged from the lowest rate 0 per 1000 person-years in etanercept users regarding lymphoma to the highest rate 35.62 per 1000 person-years in adalimumab users on non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC), while in those patients with prior cancer history, the recurrent incidences of malignancies ranged from the lowest rate 5.05 per 1000 person-years regarding melanoma to the highest rate 63.20 per 1000 person-years on basal cell carcinoma (BCC) in TNFi users. In IBD patients, incidences ranged from 0 per 1000 person-years in TNFi users on lymphoma to 34.0 per 1000 person-years in infliximab users on overall cancer. However, these incidence rates of overall cancer, lymphoma and melanoma were not higher in comparison with those patients who were not treated with TNFi. Compared to general population, incidences of lymphoma were elevated in RA patients and rates of NMSC were higher in patients with psoriasis, RA and IBD. In conclusion, cancer incidences vary across different studies, indications, cancer types and studies with different individual TNFi. Treatment with TNFi is not associated with increased malignant risks of overall cancer, lymphoma or melanoma. Results of NMSC risk were inconsistent among studies. A latest prospective registry study demonstrated a small increased risk of squamous cell cancer in RA patients treated with TNFi (one additional case for every 1600 years of treatment experience). Further prospective studies are needed to verify whether TNFi users have higher NMSC risk than non-TNFi users. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB The mechanism by which tumor microenvironment derived cytokine network modulates therapy response is of great concern in lung cancer but is not completely understood. In this study, we evaluated the effects of tumor necrosis factor a (TNF-alpha) and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) on response of lung cancer cell lines to ionizing radiation (IR). While TNF-alpha increased radio sensitivity and inhibited cell migration, treatment with IGF-1 promoted cell growth and increased migration. These effects of TNF-alpha were mediated by increased immediate activation of stress-activated protein kinases (SAPK)/jun amino-terminal kinases (JNK) and p38. IR induced DNA damage was increased by TNF-alpha and not altered by IGF-1. However, in IGF-1 treated cells, there was decreased gamma- H2AX along with an increase in mitotic index, resulting in abnormal chromosomal segregation in the cells. Bio informatics analysis of 982 lung cancer patients revealed that higher expression of TNF-alpha was associated with low risk of cancer progression while overexpression of IGF-1 was correlated with high risk. Collectively, these results reveal that the cytokines in the tumor microenvironment differentially modulate radiation therapy through a variety of signaling mechanisms. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The capability of the microalgae Chlorella vulgaris (Cv) for biomass production and nutrients removal under different wastewater quality has been studied. Cv was cultivated in a standard medium (Marine labs American society of microbiology-derived medium, MLA) blended with primary wastewater (P-WW), secondary wastewater (S-WW) and petroleum effluent (P-E) in different volume ratios. Macro and micro nutrients were characterized in each solution, and the impact on the rate of biomass growth (specific growth rate, mu) and removal efficiency (RE) determined for the bulk nutrients (total nitrogen TN and total phosphorus TP) along with a range of macro-and micro-nutrients.
   P-WW, S-WW and P-E media were found to provide an appropriate quantity and balance of nutrients to promote significantly more rapid algal growth than the standard medium MLA, with high nutrient RE achieved at the end of cultivation period. Over a 13-day period the highest biomass concentration X-max of 1.6 g L-1 was attained for PWW with corresponding values of 1.2 d(-1), 80% and 100% for mu, and TN and TP RE respectively. mu decreased to 0.75 d(-1) for a 75%: 25% blend of P-WW with MLA and to 0.54 d(-1) on further decreasing the blend ratio to 25: 75 P-WW: MLA, with corresponding TN removal efficiencies of 85% and 76% respectively; 100% removal of TP was obtained throughout. There was a slight increase in Xmax, mu and TN removal of 1.16 g L-1, 0.62 d(-1) and 83% respectively for S-WW. The lowest Xmax of 0.64 g L-1 in PE was recorded was associated with values of 0.31 d(-1), 79% and 100% for mu, and removal efficiencies of TN and TP respectively.

AB This study was designed to determine the efficiencies and mechanisms of water nutrient removal via different aquatic plant species as a potential remediation strategy for polluted rural rivers. The results showed that water hyacinth achieved the highest removal efficiency for TN (89.4%) and NH4+-N (99.0%), whereas water lettuce exhibited the highest removal efficiency for total phosphorus (93.6%) during the static experiment when water temperature ranged from 28 degrees C to 36 degrees C. In the dynamic experiment, the removal efficiency of nutrients by water hyacinth and water lettuce was better than that of Myriophyllum spicatum, when the water temperature was in the range of 14-20 degrees C. In addition, nutrient removal efficiency in ponds with all three aquatic plant species was enhanced by increased hydraulic retention time. Regarding removal mechanisms, the removal of nitrogen and phosphorus by all three aquatic plants primarily depended on plant adsorption. However, the increased removal of nitrogen by water hyacinth and water lettuce was also closely linked to microbial nitrification/denitrification because of the rich root systems of these species compared to that of Myriophyllum spicatum. Therefore, this paper presents a promising technology for in situ remediation of severely polluted rural rivers in developing countries, and will serve as a reference for the use of a combination of aquatic plants to mitigate different water quality conditions.

AB The fluid dynamics of acid mine drainage (AMD) flow through Wingfield Pines passive remediation system is captured using a lattice Boltzmann model of shallow water flow. The retention time of fluid through the system is critical to the efficient treatment of these polluted waters and, therefore, the retention times in all five settling ponds and the wetlands are elucidated for both the system as it was built, and for when vegetation is present. The effects of vegetation growth is predicted to initially cause channeling, potentially decreasing retention times, but over longer times to increasingly spread the fluid flow throughout the system and increase retention times.

AB Woodchip bioreactors are being implemented for the removal of nitrates in groundwater and tile water drainage. However, low nitrate removals in denitrifying woodchip bioreactors have been observed for short hydraulic retention time (HRT) and low water temperature (< 10 degrees C). One potential approach to improve woodchip bioreactor performance is to provide an alternative and readily available electron source to the denitrifying microorganisms through electrical stimulation. Previous work has demonstrated the capability of bio-electrochemical reactors (BER) to remove a variety of water contaminants, including nitrate, in the presence of a soluble carbon source. The objective of this study was to evaluate the denitrification efficiency of electrically augmented woodchip bioreactors and conduct a simple techno-economic analysis (TEA) to understand the possibilities and limitations for full-scale BER implementation for treatment of agricultural drainage. Up-flow column woodchip bioreactors were studied included two controls (non-energized, and without electrodes), two electrically enhanced bioreactors, each using a single 316 stainless steel anode coupled with graphite cathodes, and two electrically enhanced bioreactors, each with graphite for both anode and cathodes. Both pairs of electrically enhanced bioreactors demonstrated higher denitrification efficiencies than controls when 500 mA of current was applied. While this technology appeared promising, the techno-economic analysis showed that the normalized N removal cost ($/kg N) for BERs was 2-10 times higher than the base cost with no electrical stimulation. With our current reactor design, opportunities to make this technology cost effective require denitrification efficiency of 85% at 100 mA. This work informs the process and design of electrically stimulated woodchip bioreactors with optimized performance to achieve lower capital and maintenance costs, and thus lower N removal cost.

AB At the Kiruna iron ore mine in northern Sweden, mine drainage and process water contain elevated concentrations of nitrate (NO3-) from the use of ammonium nitrate fuel oil explosives. In order to investigate the treatment capacity of a denitrifying woodchip bioreactor technique for the removal of NO3- through denitrification, a bioreactor was installed at the mine site in 2015 and operated for two consecutive years. Neutral-pH mine drainage and process water containing 22 mg NO3--N and 1132 mg SO42- (average) was passed through the bioreactor which was filled with a reactive mixture of pine woodchips and sewage sludge, at treatment temperatures ranging between 0.8 and 17 degrees C. At bioreactor temperatures above similar to 5 degrees C, NO3- removal proceeded to below detection limits (0.06 mg N L-1) without substantial production of nitrite (NO2-), ammonium (NH4+), nitrous oxide ((NO)-O-2), or methane (CH4). The relative production of NH4+ and N2O to the NO3- reduced increased as bioreactor temperatures decreased below similar to 5 degrees C. Based on the resultant changes in alkalinity and pH from the production of bicarbonate (HCO3-) and carbonic acid (H2CO3), a stoichiometric mass balance model indicated that denitrification, nitrate reduction to ammonium (DNRA), sulfate reduction, and fermentation were the major biogeochemical processes controlling pH, alkalinity and nitrogen, sulfur and carbon concentrations in the system. It is suggested that fermentation changed from being mainly butyrate producing to acetate producing with time, triggering a decline in biogeochemical process diversity and leaving denitrification as the sole major electron accepting process.

AB A high percentage of urban areas are covered by impermeable surfaces which reduce infiltration and landscape retention of stormwater. Moreover, the pollution flushed from these areas, particularly after intensive rainfall, is often drained directly to rivers and reservoirs which, in many cases, also serve a recreational function in cities. Stormwater runoff contributes to degradation of aquatic ecosystems and their intensified eutrophication which, in growing seasons, results in toxic cyanobacterial blooms. The hybrid system (combined of engineering and biological measures) tested in this research was constructed in 2013 in Lodz city (POLNAD) to retain and purify stormwater runoff from a street that runed directly to a cascade of recreational reservoirs. The hybrid system consists of an underground separators system that is combined with a sequential sedimentation-biofiltration system (SSBS). In the first two years of the system's operation, it effectively reduced pollution transported to the urban river system by reducing 86.0% of total suspended solids, 71.5% of total nitrogen (TN), 66.7% of total phosphorous (TP), and from 40.7% to 78.3% of PO43- and NO2-, respectively. In addition, the system was able to reduce the hydraulic stress induced by extreme discharges and mitigated discharges for precipitation amounts less than 9 mm. The hybrid system is an example of a nature-based solution measure reducing the negative effects of nutrients transfer, eutrophication and flooding in urbanized areas, as part of the blue-green infrastructure.

AB Artificial emergent vegetation can increase flow resistance and water depth to improve navigation in an open channel. An innovative and eco-friendly artificial vegetation system is analyzed in this study. First, a new method is presented to modify the depth-averaged Navier-Stokes equation by incorporating the vegetation drag force term. Two analytical formulas based on theoretical analysis are proposed to predict the lateral distribution of depth-averaged velocity in an open channel with fully and partially artificial vegetation. Then, the analytical formulas are verified by laboratory experiments. The results of the analytical model are consistent with experimental data, thereby proving that the analytical formulas can be used to predict the lateral distribution of streamwise velocity in open-channel flow with artificial emergent vegetation. The presented model can provide a significant theoretical reference for research on open channels with artificial emergent vegetation.

AB The spontaneous revegetation on abandoned peat extraction areas is a slow and sporadic process. We conducted an open field experiment to clarify how to promote the revegetation of abandoned extracted peatlands. Two extracted peatlands in East Estonia with three treatments and control were analysed two, three and five years later. Our aim was to elucidate if fertilising with alkaline oil-shale ash promotes revegetation of bare peat fields; whether it speeds up establishment of plant species characteristic of natural mires; and whether the closeness to vegetated areas near the peatland edge has an effect on the formation of plant species composition. Our results showed that application of oil-shale ash and straw mulch, as well mulch alone promote clearly revegetation in studied extracted peatlands (mean plant cover 57% and 40% on fifth year, correspondingly), but at the same time quadrats with oil-shale ash alone were sparsely vegetated (4%) and similar to plots without any treatment (2%). Oil-shale ash alone did not speed up the establishment of plant species, but oil-shale ash combined with straw mulch facilitated the establishment of some species typical of natural mires. Closeness to the peatland edge increased the number of species and their cover because of the location and proximity to naturally vegetated areas. Consequently, oil-shale ash combined with straw mulch or straw mulch alone facilitated plant growth on extracted peatlands, while the effect of oil-shale ash alone was unimportant.

AB Restoration management of quarries is one of the major tasks in global restoration ecology due to the magnitude of impacts link with extraction activities and the potential conservation value of these post- industrial sites. However, identifying a target to reach can be challenging as ecological issues can be numerous and post- exploitation state can differ from the original due to ecosystems removal or topography alterations caused by exploitation.
   Here, we assess the restoration potential of gravel-sand pits for Bats, a targeted group for conservation, using data from 21 gravel-sand pits monitored by the ROSELIERE scheme and we selected external data from 76 sites of the French Bat Monitoring. We analysed the relative attractiveness of 17 habitats and 5 gravel-sand pit operating statuses (before quarrying, during quarrying, rehabilitation post- quarrying younger than 5 years, rehabilitation post- quarrying between 5 and 10 years and, finally, rehabilitation post- quarrying older than 10 years). We paid close attention to comparison between gravel-sand pits states and aquatic habitats, because the restoration process in the gravel-sand pits studied often leads to bodies of water and these habitats are among the most favorable for numerous bats species. In addition, we focus our comparisons on arable land because new gravel-sand pit settlements are usually planned on such agricultural land and furthermore because it represents the major land-use pressure for bats.
   We found that bat activity in gravel-sand pit displays a range comparable to what is observed in numerous habitats, though it does appear both slightly lower than in bodies of water and greater than arable land. Bat activity appears increasing during the gravel-sand pit life's cycle. However, only quarries which had been rehabilitated for more than 10 years exhibited significantly greater bat activity than observed in the four other gravel-sand pit states. Our results, highlight the length of time required to detect obvious changes in the attractiveness of site being rehabilitated and the magnitude of the gap between the current state and the target (i.e. aquatic habitat). Such results should be take into account when sizing offsetting measures of quarries.

TI Spatio-temporal variations in total carbon content in contaminated
   surface waters at East Kolkata Wetland Ecosystem, a Ramsar Site

AB Everyday nearly 1.1 million m(3) d(-1) composite wastewaters from different source points, both municipal and industrial, pass through the East Kolkata Wetlands (EKW) via a web of canals which is productively used as irrigation water and in pisciculture. These composite wastewaters carry huge amount of total organic carbon (TOC) and total inorganic carbon (TIC), which have profound effect on wetland biogeochemistry and point out wetland carbon sequestration potential. However, at EKW (Ramsar Site; Group A; Criterion 1), which has been designated as a unique waste dependent resource recovery ecosystem for the past several decades, no comprehensive work has been done on the ecosystem service with special reference to carbon sequestration. Therefore, the aim of the present investigation is to estimate the TOC and TIC contents in composite wastewater and wastewater-fed fish ponds at EKW ecosystem at spatio-temporal scales. Different physico-chemical factors of these waters are also estimated in the same scales to record their influence on TOC and TIC contents in EKW. ANOVA results point out significant spatial and temporal variations of TOC and TIC besides other physicochemical factors. Most of the measured factors including TOC and TIC contents are higher during pre-monsoon than in monsoon and post-monsoon periods. It is apparent from the correlation matrix that there are significant positive correlation between TOC and TIC and factors like TSS, TDS, conductivity, salinity, total hardness, F, Cl, SO4, Na, K, Ca and Mg. Principle component analysis (PCA) also suggests the significant influence of these physico-chemical factors that changed seasonally. Despite the mean level of TOC (348.05 +/- 154.98 mg L-1) in composite wastewaters at the EKW areas are higher than the USEPA safe limit (2-4 mg L-1), a significant amount of carbon is sequestered in the wetland ecosystem. Between source point and final discharge site nearly 63% of carbon of TOC and 71% carbon of TIC in wastewater have been reduced. Interestingly, comparable level of reductions, i.e., 61% for TOC and 62% for TIC have also been noted between the source point and the wastewater-fed fish ponds. Efficient partitioning of carbon in bottom sediments and in aquatic biota has been possible for the quintessential flow-rate of wastewater in the carrying canals, long residence time in the wastewater-fed fish ponds and repeated use of wastewater in irrigating agricultural fields at the EKW ecosystem.

AB To study the effect(s) of soil transplantation on survival and colonization of post-mining spoil heaps by soil fauna, we transplanted blocks of topsoil (3x10 x 0.4 m) from a well-developed meadow into the bare postmining heap in Sokolov coal mining region (Czechia) in 1995. The soil meso and macrofauna were studied in two periods, namely 1995-1997 (initial period) and 20 years later in 2015-16 (follow-up period). We sampled transplanted blocks (Transported), overburden at a 2-m distance from the blocks (Adjacent), and overburden at a 30-m distance from the blocks (Control). The number of mites was highest in the Transported, in the initial period, and at the Control 20 years after-i.e. in the follow-up period. Judging by their higher densities, for Lumbricidae, and most of the miscellaneous macrofauna, Transported was favored in both time periods. The high macroarthropod densities in the Transported position, even after 20 years, and the low microarthropod densities in the Adjacent position together suggest a limited role of transplanted soil blocks in the colonization of the spoil overburden, signifying that soil development of the spoil overburden might be even more critical than the migration barrier.

AB Over 170,000 km(2) of Acid Sulfate Soils (ASS) have been identified worldwide, with 65,000 km2 in Asia; 45,000 km2 in Africa; 30,000 km2 in Australia; 30,000 km2 in South America; and a combined total of 10,000 km2 in Europe and North America. A state-of-the-science approach to remediate these soils is to encourage tidal buffering. This approach involves the removal of drainage infrastructure and the repurposing of agricultural land back to tidal wetlands. To date, remediation efforts have largely focused on individual locations at the farm plot scale. Remediation projects have commonly focused on onsite acidity levels, groundwater transport and impacts to agricultural infrastructure. This site-based approach provides detailed information on acid hotspots, but provides limited understanding of the overall issues affecting the broader coastal floodplain.
   A catchment-wide estuarine dynamics approach has been developed and field tested to overcome current limitations. The catchment-wide approach combines onsite investigations with large-scale studies of: (i) the fate/transport of acidic plumes, (ii) the coastal floodplain response dynamics to rainfall or flooding events, and (iii) the objective prioritisation of impacted landscapes for remediation. This paper provides a detailed description of the catchment-wide approach supported by conceptual processes and a detailed case study. The 20 km(2) case study site highlights the importance of local and catchment processes in guiding rehabilitation plans.

TI Minimizing mosquito larval habitat within roadside stormwater treatment
   best management practices in southern California through incremental
   improvements to structure
SO ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING

AB A five-year study was conducted in Orange County, California to document the presence of standing water and the presence or absence of larval mosquitoes within 23 stormwater treatment Best Management Practices (BMPs) installed along State Route 73 by the California Department of Transportation. Findings were used to guide incremental improvements to BMP design and function with the aim of reducing the occurrence of standing water that persisted more than 96 h after precipitation. During the first year of monitoring, a number of structural and non-structural factors were identified as causes for standing water within BMPs suitable for mosquitoes. Uneven grades, inlet design and construction, and novel structural features were most frequently responsible for standing water, often exacerbated by sediment and debris accumulations and periodic or perennial non-stormwater flows. Subsequent modifications to BMPs eliminated or reduced the size of persistent standing water pools. The study demonstrated that mosquito larval habitat can be mitigated in BMPs designed to remain dry between precipitation events by collecting field data that identifies where post-construction structural and managerial changes are needed to eliminate or reduce unintended sources of standing water.
