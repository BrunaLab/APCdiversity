AB Acetonic crude phenolic extracts of six Georgia peach cultivars were prepared and separated into low- and high-molecular-weight (LMW and HMW) fractions by Sephadex LH-20 column chromatography. Further characterization via RP-HPLC-ESI-MS identified the main phenolics as hydroxycinnamates, (+)-catechin, and proanthocyanidins with degrees of polymerization up to seven. The LMW phenolics of the commercial cultivar, 'July Prince', were further chromatographed and examined by RP-HPLC-ESI-MS. Derivatives of phenolic acids and flavan-3-ols, along with eriodictyol and quercetin diglycosides, were identified. Antioxidant capacities of the LMW and HMW fractions were determined using in vitro assays. H-ORAC(FL) and FRAP assays gave values of 872 to 2428 mu mol Trolox eq./100 g f.w. and 309 to 432 mu mol Fe2+ eq./100 g f.w., respectively. The total phenolics content (TPC) was also measured; correlations between TPCs and antioxidant assays indicated that the HMW fractions of peach extracts were major contributors to the antioxidant capacity of the cultivars analyzed.

AB Washing rice before cooking is common to remove dust and any remaining bran produced by the milling process. In this study, the effect of washing procedure on the textural properties of cooked rice, and its relations to starch leaching and the molecular structure of leached starch are investigated. Statistical analysis indicated that the washing procedure does not significantly affect either hardness or stickiness of cooked rice, but the interaction between rice variety and washing times on stickiness is significant. The components of leached materials, chain-length distribution (CLD), and molecular size of leached starch are significantly different from those of the surface materials, but not largely varied between rices with different washing times, which helps explain the molecular mechanism of the causes of these textural results. This indicates for the first time that, the adhering materials on the surface of raw rice grains do not contribute to the texture of cooked rice.

AB The functionality of wheat flour lipids in sponge cakes prepared from flour, sugar, eggs and leavening agents only was investigated by altering their location or content in flour. Hexane (hex) or the more polar hexane:isopropanol (3:2 v/v) (hex:isoprop) were used to impact free flour lipid (FFL) or both FFL and bound flour lipid (BFL) fractions, respectively. Flour from which the FFLs were removed resulted in significantly improved cake volumes and crumb structures. Additional removal of part of the BFLs did not further impact cake quality. Prior contact of flour with hex:isoprop followed by gently removing the solvent broke native interactions between BFLs and starch or gluten and relocated more lipids than did hex. Cakes from flour with relocated lipids had coarse crumb structures. Our study demonstrates that FFLs and relocated flour lipids negatively impact sponge cake quality by disturbing air-liquid interface stabilization during mixing and the early phases of baking.

AB Foxtail millet starch was modified by annealing (AS), ultra-sonication (US) and a combination of the two treatments (annealing and ultra-sonication (AUS) or ultra-sonication and annealing (UAS)) and they were characterized. Compared to the native starch (NS), modified starches particularly UAS contained the highest amylose (27.96%). Ultra-sonication prior to annealing had a predominant effect on resistant starch (RS) level (UAS-45.59%). Among the modified starches, UAS had exhibited superior resistance to acidic (0.94) and shear (0.68) stability. Sonication, when used as the second treatment (AUS) elevated the final viscosity compared to its counter ones possibly due to the effects of cavitation promoted by sonication treatment. UAS had showed an A type diffraction pattern and dominant peaks in FT-IR spectra. It can be inferred that dual modification of starch by ultra-sonication followed by annealing had exhibited the most desirable properties such as high acid and shear resistance, high freeze-thaw stability and improved gel texture.

AB UV-C irradiation is widely used in the food industry. However, the health effects from dietary exposure to the irradiated pesticide residues retained in foodstuffs are underestimated. In this study, technical chlorpyrifos (TCPF) and its oil in water (EW) and emulsifiable concentrate (EC) formulations were irradiated by UV-C, and their photodegradation products were subjected to toxicity assessment, including determination of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity, genotoxicity and oxidative stress using human blood cells as a model system. Toxicity studies were performed using the chlorpyrifos concentrations in the range of those proposed as the maximum residue levels in plant commodities. TCPF, EW and EC photodegradation products induced DNA damage and oxidative stress, and their genotoxicity did not decrease as a function of irradiation time. Irradiated TCPF and EC are more potent AChE inhibitors than irradiated EW. Accordingly, the application of UV-C irradiation must be considered when processing the plants previously treated with chlorpyrifos formulations.

AB The effects of the main steps of Spanish-style processing (alkaline treatment and fermentation) on the volatile composition of cv. Manzanilla green olives were studied. Both spontaneous and controlled fermentations were considered. In the latter case, a Lactobacillus pentosus strain from green olive fermentation brine was used as starter culture. The volatile profile was determined by headspace solid-phase microextraction (HS-SPME) combined with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Most of the volatile compounds detected in fresh olives decreased or were undetected after alkaline treatment, while several compounds (mostly acetic acid, 2-methylbutanoic acid, and ethanol) were formed as a result of this treatment. Over 50 new volatile components, mostly esters and phenols, appeared as a result of fermentation. The most outstanding finding was a considerable increase in 4-ethyl phenol (almost 100-fold increase) in inoculated olives compared to the uninoculated product. However, a sensory panel did not find significant differences in odor perception.

AB Sorghum mutants with altered protein body structure have improved protein nutritional quality; however, practical methods to accurately track heritability of the trait are lacking. We evaluated suitability of the in vitro pepsin assay, and a new high-resolution field emission electron microscopy (FE-SEM) method to detect the mutation (HD) in hard-endosperm sorghum; and compared the physicochemical properties of experimental HD sorghums to wild type (LD) lines. FE-SEM reliably resolved sorghum protein body structure, allowing for qualitative classification of sorghum as HD or LD. The pepsin assay was less reliable, with significant variations across environments. Nevertheless, HD lines averaged higher protein digestibility (69.4% raw, 57.6% cooked) than LD lines (61.7% raw, 45.6% cooked). The HD lines also had better water solubility and starch pasting profiles than LD lines. FE-SEM, but not pepsin assay, reliably detects HD nutation in sorghum. The HD trait may improve food-use functionality of sorghum.

AB Adsorption-desorption properties of different sweeteners in the oral cavity were evaluated using high performance liquid chromatography-based methodology. Three low calorie artificial sweeteners (aspartame, acesulfame potassium and sucralose), one steviol glycoside (rebaudioside A), and high fructose corn syrup (HFCS) were examined and compared with sucrose at pH 3 and 7 in a model beverage matrix. Results indicated that HFCS had the highest adsorption in the oral cavity, followed by rebaudioside A and the artificial sweeteners. The physicochemical interaction between sweeteners and salivary proteins did not affect the adsorption properties significantly as validated from a series of characterization techniques.

AB Soy sauce materials of soybean meal and wheat bran were evaluated in solid-state (koji) fermentation (SSF) and submerged fermentation (SmF) by Aspergillus oryzae. Proteinase production in SSF (2331 +/- 39 Ug(-1)) was about 4.9 times higher than that in SmF (477 +/- 13 Ug(-1)), and glycoside hydrolase was approximately 2 times higher in SSF than that in SmF. In addition, protein expression of iTRAQ analysis deepens our understanding of the secreting mechanism. Abundant proteinases (dipeptidase, dipeptidyl aminopeptidase, puromycin-sensitive aminopeptidase, Xaa-pro aminopeptidase, neutral protease 2 and leucine aminopeptidase 2), along with the glycoside hydrolase (glycoamylase, glucosidase and beta-xylanase) were secreted at the late stage of SSF, but tripeptidyl peptidase sed 2 was proposed as an indispensable protease in SmF or the early stage of SSF. Several metabolites associated with the carbon flux and amino acid biosynthesis were proved to be regulated by the proteinase and glycoside hydrolase production.

AB In order to investigate the synergistic effect between umami peptides, monosodium glutamate (MSG) and the taste receptor T1R1/T1R3, a novel bivariate model was created based on our previous work. The results showed three specific changes upon the addition of MSG between umami peptides and T1R1/T1R3, in terms of energy and conformation. First, the addition of MSG enlarged the size of the binding cavity of T1R3 from 534.125 A(3) to 1135.75 A(3). Second, the addition of MSG caused small peptides to bind with T1R3, with the lowest docking energy and docking interaction energy, -77.2295 and -60.7146 kcal/mol respectively. Third, five binding residues,including Glu-429, Gln-302, Gly-304, Try-107 and His-364, increased which play critical roles in hydrogen bonding. They are consistent with the results of electronic tongue and facilitate better understanding of the synergism. Furthermore, novel umami and umami-enhanced compounds could be discovered, based on the use of the novel bivariate model.

AB Sauvignon blanc grapes were exposed to an ultra-violet (UV) light source post-hand harvest (whole bunches) or post-machine harvest. The thiol precursors S-3-(hexan-1-ol)-L-cysteine (Cys-3MH) and S-3-(hexan-1-ol)-L-glu tathione (GSH-3MH) were quantified in the juices before and after UV treatment. Results showed that irradiation of the grapes with UV light had little to no effect on the thiol precursors. Wines were fermented from the corresponding juices and 18 aroma compounds were quantified. Differences were found between UV treatments of the wines for 3-mercaptohexanol, hexan-l-ol, ethyl butanoate, ethyl hexanoate, ethyl octanoate and phenylethyl alcohol. However, these changes were not significant (p < 0.05) for both grape media trialled. Future studies involving larger sample sizes and replicate numbers should be completed in order to ascertain any changes in aroma chemistry as a result of UV light application to grapes postharvest.

ID RISK COMMUNICATION; PHARMACOVIGILANCE; HESITANCY; MODEL
AB Background: In 2018, the Council for International Organizations of Medical Sciences (CIOMS) issued their Guide to Vaccine Safety Communication. This has been built upon existing guidance and a new review of research and compilation of latest experiences, in order to fill, for the first time at global level, a specific niche for regulatory authorities in the contexts of vaccine hesitancy and informed choice. The Guide was developed by the international multi-stakeholder CIOMS Working Group on Vaccine Safety, formed to assist the Global Vaccine Safety Initiative (GVSI) of the World Health Organization (WHO).
   Summary: Besides the public health authorities responsible for immunization programmes, regulators have their own role in communicating about vaccine safety. As they are responsible for licensing vaccine products, they need to be transparent about their assessments of data on quality, safety and efficacy. Furthermore, they are responsible for continuous safety surveillance and keeping safe use advice to the public up-to-date. The Guide stresses the fundamental importance of regulatory bodies to have a system in place with defined functions and skilled persons who can efficiently run vaccine safety communication in collaboration with stakeholders. This system should take a strategic approach to communication, be integral to safety surveillance and risk assessment, and support vaccine safety communication plans (VacSCPs) adapted to vaccine types in local situations. The Guide provides recommendations and examples for the system components as well as a practical VacSCP template.
   Conclusions: While the Guide should help strengthening regulatory bodies worldwide with regard to vaccine safety communication, it is meant to help regulators in resource-limited countries in particular. It can also be of interest to other stakeholders and be leveraged to other medicinal products.

ID RECTAL COLONIZATION; DISEASE WORLDWIDE
AB Group B Streptococcus (GBS) is a neonatal pathogen frequently transmitted from maternal asymptomatic vagino-rectal colonization. Co-colonization with multiple GBS serotypes, which has implications for type specific vaccination strategies, is difficult to detect with standard microbiologic techniques. We designed a nested real-time PCR assay to detect vaginal co-colonization in samples from a cohort of non-pregnant women (N = 433). 6/91 (6.6%) GBS-positive samples harbored >= 2 GBS serotypes, with over-representation of serotype V among co-colonized samples. Serotype IV GBS was more prevalent (>10%) in this cohort than in previously reported United States studies. Ongoing surveillance of GBS serotype epidemiology and co-colonization is indicated.

ID HUMAN-PAPILLOMAVIRUS PREVALENCE
AB Australia's transition to primary human papillomavirus (HPV) based cervical screening, has for the first time, provided a passive mechanism for monitoring the impact of vaccination on infection prevalence among women attending screening. We assessed oncogenic HPV prevalence by single year of age in the first 7 months of the program, using data collected from a large screening laboratory in Victoria, Australia, which is routinely screening using cobas 4800, cobas 6800 and Seegene assays. Among 116,052 primary screening samples from women aged 25-74, 9.25% (95%CI: 9.09-9.42%) had oncogenic HPV detected: 2.14% (95%CI: 2.05-2.22%) were 16/18 positive and 7.12% (95%CI: 6.97-7.27%) were positive for only non-16/18 HPV. Prevalence peaked at age 25-29 then decreased with age, but this was driven by non-16/18 types. HPV16/18 prevalence remained low and flat across ages, contrasting with pre-vaccination epidemiology when HPV16/18 peaked in young women. HPV-based screening can precisely monitor HPV prevalence.

AB 2 Introduction: The recent global expansion of routine adolescent vaccination programmes has the potential to protect young people against infectious diseases and improve their health. Although the legal framework in many countries permits young people to consent for vaccinations if competent, lack of written parental consent can still prevent uptake. We aimed to review systematically the associated barriers and enablers to implementation of adolescent self-consent procedures.
   Methods: A comprehensive search strategy of ten databases from inception to June 2018 was undertaken to identify relevant qualitative and quantitative studies. Titles, abstracts and full texts were assessed for eligibility, and the methodological quality of eligible primary studies evaluated. Thematic synthesis methods were used to interpret and combine qualitative data, and to identify overarching themes as well as similarities and differences within themes. Quantitative data were summarised and, because the data were sufficiently similar in focus, were integrated within the qualitative framework.
   Results: Twenty-five publications related to 23 studies were included. Three themes were identified which related to the policy framework, protection, and self-determination. Despite supportive national policy frameworks, implementation of adolescent self-consent procedures can be prevented by local policies, professionals' misunderstandings of the legal framework and the context in which the vaccination programme is delivered. Motivation to protect young people's health increased acceptability of adolescent self-consent, but implementation might be prevented to protect the reputation of professionals or relationships with parents. Further, maintaining the role of parents as decision-makers for their child's healthcare was frequently prioritised over enabling young people's autonomy to consent.
   Conclusions: Barriers to the implementation of adolescent self-consent procedures have implications for young people's health and uptake of vaccination programmes. There is a need to clarify the policy framework and challenge the primacy of parental consent. (C) 2018 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI Strengthening national vaccine decision-making: Assessing the impact of
   SIVAC Initiative support on national immunisation technical advisory
   group (NITAG) functionality in 77 low and middle-income countries

ID ESTABLISHMENT
AB Background: National Immunisation Technical Advisory Groups (NITAGs) are multi-disciplinary expert groups that provide policy-makers with independent, evidence-based advice on vaccination. Between 2008 and 2017, the SIVAC Initiative supported establishment and strengthening of NITAGs in low and lower-middle income countries though its impact was never assessed quantitatively.
   Aim: To quantitatively assess whether SIVAC support is associated with a faster rate at which NITAGs became functional based on six performance indicators.
   Methods: Data from the World Health Organization/Unicef Joint Reporting Form (JRF) from 77 low and lower-middle-income countries were used to examine the time delay between the start of SIVAC support and NITAG functionality using a Cox proportional hazards model.
   Results: Countries receiving SIVAC support took a mean of 2.00 (95% CI 1.40-2.60) years to reported functionality compared to 2.82 (95% CI 2.05-3.59) years for countries without SIVAC support. We found evidence that SIVAC support is associated with reduced time until NITAG functionality, and this association cannot fully be explained by GDP per capita, percentage of GDP spent on healthcare, or NITAG functionality score at the start of the study period. However, quality of JRF data for the questions used to calculate NITAG functionality were poor, particularly for countries not receiving SIVAC support.
   Conclusion: SIVAC support is likely to have enabled many countries to more rapidly achieve NITAG functionality. (C) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI Safety and immunogenicity of influenza A(H5N1) vaccine stored up to
   twelve years in the National Pre-Pandemic Influenza Vaccine Stockpile
   (NPIVS)

AB Background: As part of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Pandemic Influenza Plan preparedness and response strategy, the National Pre-Pandemic Influenza Vaccine Stockpile (NPIVS) program was established by the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) in 2005 with the goal of building and maintaining a stockpile of vaccines for influenza viruses with pandemic potential to vaccinate 20 million people in the critical workforce in the event of a pandemic. The NPIVS program continuously monitors the integrity of influenza vaccine antigens and adjuvants stored within the stockpile. In addition to monitoring physical and chemical properties in stability studies, it is important to regularly assess the safety and immunogenicity of stockpiled vaccines and adjuvants to maintain preparedness for use in the event of an influenza pandemic.
   Methods: BARDA conducted a randomized, double-blinded Phase 2 clinical study with the oldest stockpiled influenza A(H5N1) antigen, stored over the previous 10-12 years administered with or without MF59 (R) adjuvant, stored over the previous 2-7 years at the time of vaccination.
   Results: Stockpiled vaccines were well-tolerated, adverse events were generally mild, and there was no drop in immunogenicity to the oldest stockpiled A(H5N1) vaccine. Compared to unadjuvanted vaccine, greater peak antibody responses were observed in subjects who were vaccinated with MF59-adjuvanted vaccines, regardless of antigen dose. Vaccination with the A(H5N1) vaccine antigen also results in cross-reactive antibody responses to contemporary circulating strains of A(H5) influenza viruses.
   Conclusions: The frequency, type, and severity of AEs observed during this study are similar to historical clinical study data with A(H5N1) vaccines and MF59 adjuvant indicating that a stockpiled A(H5N1) vaccine appears to remain safe and tolerable. The vaccines were immunogenic when administered as a two-dose vaccine regimen in healthy adults, despite extended storage of HA antigen or MF59 adjuvant within the NPIVS. (C) 2018 The Authors.

AB Newcastle disease (ND) is one of the most severe avian infectious disease inflicting a great loss on poultry industry worldwide. The control of ND relies on proper vaccination strategies. The vaccine strains of Newcastle disease virus (NDV) mainly belong to genotype I, II or III, which cannot fully prohibit virus shedding against the prevalent genotype VII virulent strain attack. To develop a safe, genotype matched vaccine candidate, we employed a bac-to-bac expression system and constructed a genotype VII NDV strain based virus-like particles (NDV VLPs). It was constructed with NDV M protein as the skeleton, and protective antigen F and HN proteins displayed on the surface. The NDV VLPs exhibited a similar appearance to the live NDV particles, but with denser F and HN proteins displayed on the surface. The immunization assay indicated that NDV VLPs stimulated a longer protection period, less tissue virus loading and shorter virus shedding period than the commercialized LaSota-formulated vaccine when challenged with genotype VII NDV strain. These results proposed the potential role of NDV VLPs as an alternative to current live genotype unmatched vaccine for the control and eliminate NDV in the avian flocks. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Traditionally, immune response to influenza vaccines has been measured using the haemagglutination inhibition (HAI) assay. A broader repertoire of techniques including the sensitive viral microneutralization (VMN) assay is now recommended by the European Medicines Agency (EMA). Comparing HAI and VMN, we determined immune response to a trivalent 2015-2016 seasonal inactivated influenza vaccine (SIIV) administered to 28 recipients of allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT). Vaccination was within the first-year post-transplant at a median of 78.5 (24-363) days. The proportion of patients with baseline and post-vaccination HAI titres >= 1:40 were 28.6% and 25% for A(H1N1)pdm09, 14.3% at both timepoints for A(H3N2), and 32.1% and 25% for B(Phuket). Pre and Post-vaccination geometric mean titres(GMT) were higher by VMN than HAI for A(H1N1)pdm09 and A(H3N2), but lower for B(Phuket) (p=<0.05). Geometric mean ratios(GMR) of baseline and post-vaccination titres were similar by HAI and VMN(p > 0.05) for all components. A single seroconversion to A(H1N1) was detected by ELISA-VMN. None of patient age, lymphocyte count, days from transplant to vaccination, donor type, or graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) or immunosuppressive therapy (IST) at vaccination correlated with baseline or post-vaccination titres by either assay. This absence of seroresponse to SIIV in the first-year post HSCT highlights the need for novel immunogenic vaccination formulations and schedules in this high-risk population.

AB Background & aims: After nearly 30 years of immunization, there is little known about the prevalence of hepatitis B core antibody (anti-HBc) in Chinese children. The clinical significance of anti-HBc would be more and more important. In this study, we had tried to analyse the prevalence of anti-HBc in vaccinated Chinese children, exploring the post-immunization status based on a large sample sized investigation.
   Methods: Proportions of anti-HBc were analysed among 215,627 hospitalized Chinese children immunized with HBV vaccination in this study.
   Results: The proportions of anti-HBc were divided into 3 stages: 36.6% in 0-year-old group, followed by 1- to 10-year-old which stayed relatively stable (5.69 +/- 0.40%, [4.86-6.28%]), and significant increasing within 11- to 16-year-old (7.80 +/- 1.24%, [6.62-9.74%]), meanwhile, similar changes of HBsAg were showed in the corresponding ages, and significantly increased in children older than 9-year (1.40%, [1.00-2.04%]), comparing with 0.30% in 0-year-old, 0.55 +/- 0.13% (0.30-0.64%) in 1- to 9-year-old. The average level of anti-HBc maintains 5.99% in children aged 1- to 16-year with 0.63% for HBsAg.
   Conclusion: This is the first study of the prevalence of anti-HBc in vaccinated Chinese children: 36.6% of anti-HBc-positivity was found in 0-year-old group, which could be maternal in origin. Relatively high prevalence of anti-HBc may not be ignored in children aged 1- to 16-year-old. Strangely, our data also showed that HBV breakthrough infection would occur in immunized Chinese children older than 9-year-old, and more attention is needed on those children. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Background: In 2014 the Kenya National Immunization Technical Advisory Group (KENITAG) was asked by the Ministry of Health to provide an evidence-based recommendation on whether the seasonal influenza vaccine should be introduced into the national immunization program (NIP).
   Methods: We reviewed KENITAG manuals, reports and meeting minutes generated between June 2014 and June 2016 in order to describe the process KENITAG used in arriving at that recommendation and the challenges encountered.
   Results: KENITAG developed a recommendation framework to identify critical, important and non-critical data elements that would guide deliberations on the subject. Literature searches were conducted in several databases and the quality of scientific articles obtained was assessed using the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme tool. There were significant gaps in knowledge on the national burden of influenza disease among key risk groups, i.e., pregnant women, individuals with co-morbidities, the elderly and health care workers. Insufficient funding and limited work force hindered KENITAG activities.
   In 2016 KENITAG recommended introduction of the annual seasonal influenza vaccine among children 6 to 23 months of age. However, the recommendation was contingent on implementation of a pilot study to address gaps in local data on the socio-economic impact of influenza vaccination programs, strategies for vaccine delivery, and the impact of the vaccination program on the healthcare workforce and existing immunization program. KENITAG did not recommend the influenza vaccine for any other risk group due to lack of local burden of disease data.
   Conclusion: Local data are a critical element in NITAG deliberations, however, where local data and in particular burden of disease data are lacking, there is need to adopt scientifically acceptable methods of utilizing findings from other countries to inform local decisions in a manner that is valid and acceptable to decision makers.

AB OprI is an outer membrane lipoprotein from Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and when fused to a recombinant antigen, will exert adjuvant properties by engaging Toll-like receptor 2, leading to dendritic cell activation. Previous studies have shown that the Neospora caninum (Nc) antigens NcPDI, NcROP2 and NcROP40 are implicated in host cell interactions and are promising vaccine candidates. In two independent experiments, the efficacy of a polyvalent vaccine formulation composed of OprI-NcPDI, OprI-NcROP2 and OprI-NcROP40 (collectively named O-Ags) was assessed in non-pregnant and pregnant Balb/c mouse models challenged with tachyzoites of the high-virulence isolate Nc-Spain7. Parameters that were investigated were clinical signs, fertility, parasite burden in adult mice, humoral and cellular immune responses at different time-points prior to and after challenge infection, vertical transmission and post-natal survival of offspring mice, all to explore potential correlations with efficacy. Vaccination of mice with O-Ags induced a mixed Th1/Th2 immune response in adult mice and led to significantly increased protection against cerebral infection. Vaccination with O-Ags also resulted in reduced vertical transmission, and postnatal disease in offspring was significantly inhibited at a rate not observed in mice infected with a high-virulence isolate to date. However, O-Ags mixed with TLR ligands targeting TLR3 and TLR7, which are known to induce clear Th1-biased responses, or vaccination with OprI fused to the non-N. caninum antigen ovalbumin (OprI-OVA) did not confer protection.

AB Because H5N1 influenza viruses continuously threaten the public health, the WHO has prepared various clades of H5N1 mock-up vaccines as one of the measures for pandemic preparedness. The recent worldwide outbreak of H5Nx virus which belongs to clade 2.3.4.4 and of which H5N6 subtype belongs and already caused human infection also increases the need of pandemic vaccine for such novel emerging viruses. In this study, we evaluated the protective efficacy and immunogenicity of an egg-based and inactivated whole-virus H5N8 (IDCDC-RG43A) developed by CDC containing HA and NA gene of the parent virus A/gyrfalcon/Washington/41088-6/2014. Mice vaccinated two times elicited low to moderate antibody titer in varying amount of antigen doses against the homologous H5N8 vaccine virus and heterologous intra-clade 23.4.4 H5N6 (A/Sichuan/26221/2014) virus. Mice immunized with at least 3.0 mu g/dose of IDCDC-RG43A with aluminum hydroxide adjuvant were completely protected from lethal challenge with the mouse-adapted H5N8 (A/Environment/Korea/ma468/2015, maH5N8) as well as cleared the viral replication in tissues including lung, brain, spleen, and kidney. Vaccinated ferrets induced high antibody titers against clade 2.3.4.4 H5N8/H5N6 viruses and the antibody showed high cross-reactivity to Glade 2.2 H5N1 but not to clade 1 and 2.3.4 viruses as measured by hemagglutinin inhibition and serum neutralization assays. Furthermore, administration of the vaccine in ferrets resulted in attenuation of clinical disease signs and virus spread to peripheral organs including lung, spleen, and kidney from high dose challenge with maH5N8 virus. The protective and immunogenic characteristic of the candidate vaccine are essential attributes to be considered for further clinical trials as a pre-pandemic vaccine for a potential pandemic virus.

AB Introduction: S. aureus is a pathogen to which individuals are exposed shortly after birth, with immune responses to S. aureus increasing during childhood. There is marked heterogeneity between the anti- S. aureus immune responses of different humans, the basis of which is not fully understood.
   Methods: To investigate development of anti-S. aureus immune responses, we studied S. aureus colonised mice under controlled conditions. Mice were either acquired colonised from breeding colonies, or experimentally colonised by exposure to a cage environment which had been sprayed with a S. aureus suspension. Colonisation was monitored by sequential stool sampling, and immunoglobulin levels against both whole fixed S. aureus and individual S. aureus antigens quantified. The immunological impact of colonisation on subsequent vaccination was investigated.
   Results: Colonised BALB/c and BL/6 mice develop serum anti- S. aureus cell surface IgG1 antibodies. Responses were proportional to the cumulative S. aureus bioburden in the mice, and were higher in BALB/c mice, which have higher colonisation levels, than in C57BL/6 animals. We observed marked variation in the induction of anti-cell surface antibodies, even in genetically identical mice experimentally colonised with the same S. aureus clone. Heterogeneity was also evident when monitoring immune responses to the secreted S. aureus protein EapH2. Approximately 50% of colonised mice developed anti-EapH2 responses (responders); in other mice, responses were not significantly different to those in uncolonised mice (non-responders). Following vaccination with a replication deficient adenovirus expressing EapH2, less anti-EapH2 antibody was generated in non-responder than responder animals.
   Conclusions: In genetically identical mice, S. aureus colonisation results in all-or-nothing antibody responses against some antigens, including EapH2. For antigens involved in colonisation success by microbes, apparently stochastic early immune responses may impact both vaccine responses and the establishment of an animal-specific microbiome.

AB Introduction: There is a need for an efficacious vaccine reducing infections due to Staphylococcus aureus, a common cause of community and hospital infection. Infecting organisms originate from S. aureus populations colonising the nares and bowel. Antimicrobials are widely used to transiently reduce S. aureus colonisation prior to surgery, a practice which is selecting for resistant S. aureus isolates. S. aureus secretes multiple proteins, including the protease inhibitors extracellular adhesion protein homologue 1 and 2 (EapH1 and EapH2).
   Methods: Mice were vaccinated intramuscularly or intranasally with Adenovirus serotype 5 and Modified Vaccinia Ankara viral vectors expressing EapH1 and EapH2 proteins, or with control viruses. Using murine S. aureus colonisation models, we monitored S. aureus colonisation by sequential stool sampling. Monitoring of S. aureus invasive disease after intravenous challenge was performed using bacterial load and abscess numbers in the kidney.
   Results: Intramuscular vaccination with Adenovirus serotype 5 and Modified Vaccinia Ankara viral vectors expressing EapH1 and EapH2 proteins significantly reduces bacterial recovery in the murine renal abscess model of infection, but the magnitude of the effect is small. A single intranasal vaccination with an adenoviral vaccine expressing these proteins reduced S. aureus gastrointestinal (GI) tract colonisation.
   Conclusion: Vaccination against EapH1 / EapH2 proteins may offer an antibiotic independent way to reduce S. aureus colonisation, as well as contributing to protection against S. aureus invasive disease. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Infection with Streptococcus pneumoniae is a life-threatening, but vaccine preventable complication in patients with allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT). The international consensus on post allo-HSCT immunization schedules, starting 3-6 months after HSCT, focuses on short-term immunogenicity while long-term immunogenicity is not well characterized. The current Dutch immunization schedule, which starts at 12 months post allo-HSCT, was developed as a result of concerns on the coverage of long-term immunogenicity in international guidelines. We recently encountered two cases of allo-HSCT recipients who developed invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) despite adequate revaccinations, which led us to question the immunogenicity of pneumococcal vaccinations in this patient group, and whether the currently existing vaccination schedules are appropriate. We included allo-HSCT recipients, vaccinated from one year after transplantation, and tested antibody responses to pneumococcal vaccination. We also performed a systematic review. Antibody concentrations were measured in 42 of 103 (41%) patients, with a response rate of 85% to PCV13 and 62% to PPSV23-unique serotypes. In six relevant studies, protection rates varied between 64 and 98%. Antibody responses in early and late vaccination schedules were similar, but adequate antibody responses were maintained better after late vaccination. Therefore, we propose a vaccination schedule that combines the advantages of early and late vaccination. This new schedule has been introduced since March 2018 in the two academic hospitals in Amsterdam, The Netherlands. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Leishmaniasis is an expanding health threat worldwide complicated by the absence of an effective vaccine. We investigated transcutaneous immunization (TO) as a needle-free immunization route which exploits the abundance of antigen presenting cells in the skin to induce both mucosal and systemic immunity. Leishmania (L) major soluble antigens (SLA) or recombinant Leishmania homolog of receptors for activated C-kinase (rLACK) antigens were delivered transcutaneously together with cholera toxin (CT), to BALB/c mice. Mice were immunized at weeks 1, 4, and 7 with PBS, CT, SLA/CT or rLACK/CT. Two weeks after the final boost, antigen-specific IgG titers, IFN-gamma ELISpot, and cytokine levels were assessed in half of the mice and the remainder were challenged with an intradermal (ear) injection of 5 x 10(4) L major metacyclic parasites. Mice were monitored weekly and sacrificed after 7 weeks to assess the parasite burden and to study the ear lesion immunohistopathology. Our results show that TO with SLA or rLACK yielded high levels of anti-SLA, anti-rLACK and anti-CT IgG antibodies. A Th1-type of immune response was demonstrated with a high frequency of IFN-gamma secreting cells, high levels of IFN-gamma production, and lower levels of IL-10 resulting in a high IFN-gamma/IL-10 ratio in mice immunized with SLA/CT or rLACK/CT. After parasite challenge, rLACK immunization was not associated with protection. In addition, SLA/CT immunized mice had larger ear lesions and an increased parasite load in the ear. Immunohistochemistry of ear biopsies stained for nitric oxide synthase revealed that staining intensity was diminished in the SLA/CT group compared to the control group. This finding suggested that less parasite killing occurred at the site of the infection.
   In conclusion, despite a strong Th1 type profile induced by TCI, exacerbation of infection occurred after challenge with L major. This also correlated with low induction of nitric oxide. (C) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

ID KNOWLEDGE; ATTITUDES
AB Background: Pediatric healthcare providers (HCPs) are a major resource which helps parents make decisions about their children's vaccinations. It is important to assess their behavior to encourage the receipt of routine vaccines.
   Objectives: (1) To evaluate the knowledge level of and attitudes towards routine childhood vaccinations among pediatric HCPs; (2) To assess their behavior to encourage the receipt of routine vaccinations and associated predictors; (3) To examine their willingness to receive immunization training and to improve their skills to cope with vaccine-hesitant parents.
   Study design and settings: This is a cross-sectional study among pediatric physicians and nurses working at primary clinics (curative service) and mother-child health clinics (preventive service) in Jewish localities in the Northern District of Israel.
   Methods: A structured, anonymous, self-administered questionnaire was used.
   Results: The study included 271 HCPs (response rate = 72.2%). An insufficient knowledge level about vaccines was demonstrated among participants (mean score: 5.2 +/- 0.91 and 4.71 +/- 1.21 points out of 6 in the preventive and curative services, respectively; p = 0.000). The overall attitude towards vaccinations was positive (mean score: 45.40 +/- 5.98 and 42.95 +/- 6.84 points out of 56 in the preventive and curative services, respectively; p = 0.002). The two predictors that were associated with the behavior of HCPs to encourage childhood vaccinations were workplace (preventive vs. curative service) and the number of parents encountered by the HCP who opposed or feared vaccines. No association was found between the behavior and the knowledge level and the attitudes. Of the HCPs, 79.3% were interested in immunization training and 66.1% in participating in workshops to improve their communication skills to cope with vaccine-hesitant parents.
   Conclusions: There is a need to increase the commitment of HCPs to encourage parents to vaccinate their children with routine vaccines, to improve their knowledge about vaccines, and to provide them with communication tools to deal with vaccine-hesitant parents.

ID INFECTION; PREVALENCE; BELIEFS
AB Aim: To our knowledge there are no studies exploring Saudi women's understanding of the importance of the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine. In the present study, we examined the awareness of HPV and women's attitudes toward the HPV vaccine.
   Method: Nine focus groups were formed in Riyadh City, Saudi Arabia, including 77 women between the ages of 18 and 45 years old. Face-to-face interviews were conducted in 58 female healthcare providers to examine women's awareness of cervical cancer, HPV, barriers, acceptance, beliefs, and attitudes towards the HPV vaccine.
   Results: Focus group discussions revealed a lack of knowledge and awareness of cervical cancer, HPV, and the HPV vaccine. Cultural concerns regarding screening and vaccinating for a conventionally known sexually transmitted infection were an emerging theme in addition to not perceiving cervical cancer screening as necessary because women with no signs and symptoms considered themselves not at risk for developing cervical cancer. Approximately 30% of healthcare providers other than physicians were unaware of prevention methods, and 63.3% did not practice any screening methods for cervical cancer and attributed the lack of screening to "no specific reasons at all".
   Conclusion: Because of the unfavorable knowledge and attitude of HPV infection and the associated vaccine from the women in the present study, emphasis should be directed to educate and promote awareness of women to the risk factors of cervical cancer and to the need for screening programs and the administration of the vaccine.

AB The influence of HP beta CD on the thermal denaturation of lysozyme was analyzed mainly from microcalorimetry and Raman investigations carried out in the molecular fingerprint and the low-frequency regions. It was shown that Raman spectroscopy investigations performed on a wide spectral range give the opportunity to describe the influence of HP beta CD on the mechanism of protein denaturation. Using D2O as solvent allowed us to show that HP beta CD mainly destabilizes the tertiary structure of lysozyme by enhancing the protein flexibility and thus inducing the destabilization of the secondary structure. Principal components analysis (PCA) was used for spectra treatment, providing important information about inclusion complex formation between protein hydrophobic residues and CDs molecules. Combining PCA and classical technics (curve fitting) of data analysis allowed a better understanding of the influence of HP beta CD on the protein denaturation that seems to be related to the CDs capacity to form inclusion complex. It was observed that these interactions prevent the formation of new strong H-bonds between beta-sheet structures thereby inhibiting protein aggregation. This study reveals that CDs are promising systems for inhibiting protein aggregation without protein denaturation, only if designing derivative CDs is carefully controlled.

AB Berberine chloride (BCl) can exist as an anhydrate, monohydrate, dihydrate, and tetrahydrate. Therefore, it faces the problem of humidity dependent solid phase change when environmental humidity varies during manufacturing and storage of berberine tablets. We have discovered a new 1:1 cocrystal formed between berberine chloride and citric acid (BCl-CA) that exhibits better stability against variations in humidity while maintaining similar thermal stability, solubility, dissolution rate, and tabletability. Thus, BCl-CA is a good alternative crystal form for use in formulation to manufacture berberine tablets.

   APPLICATION
AB Parametric release was the first subset of real time release testing (RTRT), applied to terminally sterilised injectable drug products. The objective was to offer the industry an alternative to the time and money consuming sterility testing, without compromising the sterility of the products. The rationale was that quality cannot be tested into products, instead it must be planned (the principle of quality by design, QbD). This can be implemented by setting appropriate in-process controls supported on process analytical technologies (PAT). Two of the most versatile and promising PAT tools are the near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) and the Raman spectroscopy. However, their application to injectable drug product development and manufacturing has been scarce. This review has the objective to provide a framework for the practical implementation of the QbD approach to injectable formulations, including application of diverse risk assessment and factorial design tools. Finally, the actual application of PAT, namely NIRS and Raman spectroscopy, to injectable drug product analysis is addressed.

AB It is desirable to design nanoparticles for oral insulin delivery that can cross mucus layer and epithelial membrane in the intestine in the meantime. Thus, using chitosan (CS) as the nanocarrier, the objective of this study is to elucidate the contribution of surface hydrophilic and hydrophobic modification on the oral absorption of insulin and the essential for these two strategies combination. First of all, the polyelectronic nanocomplexes (PEC) based on synthesized CS-g-polyethylene glycol monomethyl ether (mPEG) copolymers with different mPEG graft ratios were prepared by self-assembly method and their physicochemical properties were characterized, and surface hydrophilicity and interaction with mucus were estimated. The hypoglycemic effect and pharmacological availability of the PECs following oral administration were evaluated in rats. It was found that the best absorption was achieved at mPEG graft ratio 10%. Thereafter, with newly synthesized mPEG(10%)-CS-glyceryl monocaprylate (GMC)(10%) copolymers, the added hydrophobic modification on the in vitro and in vivo properties of the mPEG(10%)-CS based PECs were explored. Further modification of CS-mPEG(10%) with GMC led to prolonged therapeutic effect but without statistical difference in pharmacological availability. In summary, this study indicated that the in vivo absorption of nanocarrier was surface property dependent, with appropriate hydrophilicity preferred over hydrophobic modification.

AB Amorphous Solid Dispersion (ASD) based formulations have been frequently used to improve the bioavailability of poorly water soluble drugs, however, common processes to produce ASDs are not feasible for Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism and Excretion (ADME) studies with radio-labeled Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (API) due to the complications associated with radioactive material handling. Liquid formulations are routinely used to support the ADME studies, though bridging the bioperformance between a liquid formulation to the amorphous dosage form for poorly soluble compounds has not been well studied, and can be challenging due to the potentially rapid in vitro and in vivo recrystallization and precipitation. Here we report the development of a fit for purpose liquid formulation that could accommodate the radioactive API and provide comparable bioavailability relative to the amorphous formulation without the need for dose adjustment A number of formulation approaches were explored and the prototype formulations were evaluated by dissolution and preclinical pharmacokinetic studies. A PolyEthylene Glycol 400 (PEG 400) based solution formulation impregnated with a polymer, HydroxyPropyl MethylCellulose Acetate Succinate-L (HPMCAS-L), was identified as the lead formulation. It was found that the bioavailability of the formulation can be compromised by the presence of undissolved crystalline seeds, and the inclusion of HPMCAS-L can mitigate this effect, as well as potentially facilitate the nanoparticle formation. During the study, it is also noted that although dissolution test is instrumental in the formulation development, the in vitro study over predicted the extent of in vivo precipitation for PEG 400 formulation containing no crystalline seeds.

AB This is a case study of the use of rapidly-dissolving naproxen crystalline nanoparticles to prepare compressed tablets. The dissolution rates of different formulations were determined: the crystalline pure-drug nanodispersion, a pure-drug microsuspension, a granule prepared by spray drying the nanodispersion with mannitol, and a tablet prepared by compressing the granule with a bulking agent and a disintegrant. The goal was to determine the influence of each of the process steps on the rapid dissolution of the nanodispersion. A procedure was developed to allow sampling during the first 120 s of dissolution. Dissolution of the nanodispersion was completed after 60s under both sink and non-sink conditions. Spray drying with mannitol delayed dissolution slightly under both sink and non-sink conditions. Under sink conditions a microsuspension (volume median size 11 mu m) showed similar rapid dissolution to the nanodispersion. We propose this to be a result of rapid shrinkage of the microparticles on dissolution under sink conditions. This nullifies any effects of specific surface on dissolution rate. Under non-sink conditions the microparticles retain their lower specific surface for a longer time during dissolution and dissolve therefore more slowly. When compressed into tablets, the dissolution rates of nanoparticles or microparticles were determined primarily by the tablet disintegration time; the influence of sink or non-sink conditions was only observable after disintegration.

AB Celecoxib (CEL) is a selective cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitor therapeutically indicated for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, acute pain, and inflammation. However, its poor solubility and dissolution rate significantly hinders its broader application. In this study, eutectic mixtures, as binary pharmaceutical compositions of CEL with adipic acid (ADI) and saccharin (SAC), were identified through a phase diagram and Tammann's triangle intended to improve the wettability and dissolution rate of poorly water-soluble CEL. The contact angles at Os in the liquid-solid interface were approximately theta s (theta) 79.7 +/- 0.50 degrees and 86.65 +/- 0.45 degrees for CEL-ADI and CEL-SAC, respectively, which were much lower than the value obtained for CEL (92.05 +/- 0.75 degrees theta). Moreover, a comparison of the disk intrinsic dissolution rate and powder dissolution properties demonstrated that eutectic mixtures significantly increased the dissolution rate compared with CEL and physical mixtures. A general relationship was elucidated and indicated that the dissolution rate was increased as the contact angle decreased (correlation coefficient, r = 0.9966 +/- 0.0031). Therefore, CEL-ADI and CEL-SAC eutectics may offer a novel formulation strategy to enhance the solubility and oral bioavailability of CEL.

AB Nanoparticles (NPs)-based vaccine delivery systems are widely used for their ability to control the release of antigens and promote immune responses against cancer or infectious diseases. In this study, the immunopotentiator Angelica sinensis polysaccharide (ASP) and model protein antigen ovalbumin (OVA) were encapsulated into Poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) to formulate the novel NPs-based vaccine delivery system (ASP-PLGA/OVA). These formulations were subcutaneously administered to mice, then the magnitude and kinetics of antibody and cellular immune responses were assessed. The ASP-PLGA/OVA NPs were pherical in shape with smooth surfaces, approximately 225.2 nm in average size, negatively charged (around -11.27 mV), and the encapsulation efficiency of OVA at around 66.28%, respectively. Furthermore, ASP-PLGA/OVA NPs could keep stable at 4 degrees C over 30 days and provide a sustained and controlled release of OVA from the NPs. The results demonstrated that mice immunized with ASP-PLGA/OVA NPs could significantly enhance lymphocyte proliferation and improve the ratio of CD4(+) to CD8(+) T cells, thereby ASP-PLGA/OVA NPs could induce a strong cellular immune response. Moreover, the ASP-PLGA/OVA NPs could induce vigorous and long-term IgG immune responses with a mixed Th1 and Th2 responses and up-regulate the levels of Th-associated cytokines. These results suggested that ASP-PLGA/OVA NPs, which stimulated strong and continuous antibody responses and induced cellular immune responses, could potentially serve as an efficient and safe vaccine delivery and adjuvant system against infections and diseases.

AB Staphylococcus aureus, a leading cause of serious human infections in both healthcare and community settings, is increasingly difficult to control due to expanding resistance to multiple antibiotic classes. Methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) strains have disseminated on a global scale and are associated with adverse patient outcomes, increased hospital stays, and significant economic costs to the healthcare system. A proximal step in S. aureus infection is colonization of the nasal mucosa, and effective strategies to decolonize high risk patients to reduce the risk of invasive infection and nosocomial spread represent an important clinical priority. With rising resistance to mupirocin, the most common antibiotic utilized for nasal MRSA decontamination, we are examining the use of pure molecular iodine (I-2)-based formulations for this indication. Recently, an iodophor formulation of povidone-iodine (PVP-I) has shown significant promise for nasal MRSA decontamination by swabbing the anterior nares of patients in hospital settings, but the I-2 concentration in this treatment is less than 0.01% of total iodine species present and like all providone-iodine formulations causes skin staining. Here we determine that a novel non-staining formulation of I-2 combined with the safe organic emollient glycerin delivers high local concentrations of the active antimicrobial entity (I-2) with minimal evaporative loss, exhibits activity at similar to 1 part per million against MRSA and other important Gram-positive and -negative human pathogens. This formulation for I-2 topical delivery produced similar reductions in mean bacterial burden and was associated with fewer treatment failures (< 2-logfold reduction) than PVP-I in a murine model of MRSA nasal decontamination. Formulations of I-2 in glycerin emollient merit further exploration as topical disinfectants for human medical indications.

AB Oxygen is essential in physiology and pathophysiology. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) oximetry, using oxygen sensitive paramagnetic materials, could be attractive for measuring oxygen in tissues. The aim of the present study was to assess the properties of lipid nanocapsules (LNCs) loaded with the nitroxide tempo-benzoate (TB) or tetrathiatriarylmethyl (TAM) radicals. LNCs loaded with the EPR probes were successfully prepared by the phase inversion process leading to nanocapsules of about 60 nm. LNCs protected the TB radical against reduction in vitro. The calibration of the EPR line width (LW) as a function of the pO(2) showed a two-fold increase in sensitivity with TAM-LNC compared to hydrophilic trityl radical. The TAM-LNCs were evaluated in vivo. Contrarily to unencapsulated TAM, for which a rapid decrease in EPR signal was observed, the half-life of TAM-LNCs administered in muscles or in tumours exceeded an hour. Carbogen-challenges in mice demonstrated that the TAM-LNCs responded well to changes in oxygen environment However, the apparent pO(2) values acquired were higher than the expected physiological values. These results warrant further investigation in the formulation of stable nano-objects encapsulating EPR oxygen sensitive probes.

AB The combination of photothermal therapy and targeted chemotherapy can produce much greater cytotoxicity than chemotherapy. Herein, we developed multifunctional targeted polymeric nanoparticles (NPs) loaded with indocyanine green (ICG) and doxorubicin (DOX) for the targeted photoacoustic imaging and photothermal ablation of oral cancer cells. The chemokine SDF-1, a specific antibody, was conjugated to NPs by the carbodiimide method. The NPs were automatically targeted to tumour tissue in vitro and in vivo through CXCR4-SDF-1 interactions. The results of in vivo and in vitro photoacoustic imaging and photothermal therapy experiments showed that the multifunctional NPs had excellent photoacoustic imaging characteristics and photothermal therapy capabilities. The photothermal material heated rapidly after laser irradiation, and the resulting heat increased cell metabolism and membrane permeability, which increased cellular NP uptake. The encapsulated drug (DOX) was released immediately after the liquid core was transformed into a gas via laser effects, which killed tumour cells while producing strong photoacoustic signals in vitro and in vivo. Thus, we concluded that the chemokine SDF-1 can be applied for the targeted chemotherapy of metastatic lymph nodes of oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) and is more effective for treating oral cancer when combined with photothermal therapy than when used alone.

AB Clotrimazole (CLT) was formulated in a nanoemulsion (NE) for the topical treatment of candidiasis consisting of 10% labrafac (R) lipophile, 60% labrasol (R):capryol (R) 90 mixture (ratio 4:1) and 30% propylene glycol. Physicochemical properties, stability, rheology, in vitro drug release, ex vivo drug permeation through human skin and porcine buccal, sublingual and vaginal mucosae, antifungal efficacy, as well as in vivo skin tolerance were evaluated. 1% CLT-NE (CLT-NE1) and 2% CLT-NE (CLT-NE2) exhibited 153 +/- 17.25 and 186 +/- 15.38 nm droplet sizes, low polydispersity indexes, negative zeta potentials and biocompatible pH values. The CLT-NEs exhibited typical Newtonian profiles with viscosities of 42.14 +/- 0.037 mPa.s and 41.35 +/- 0.041 mPa.s, respectively and higher extensibility properties than commercial counterparts retaining their physicochemical properties for 180 days. NEs provided a sustained release of drug according to the first order model. Similar skin permeation properties were observed between CLT-NE1 and commercial reference. However, significant higher CLT amounts retained in mucosae were provided by CLT-NE2 when compared with references. Antifungal efficacies were also higher than commercial references, and the in vivo tolerance study confirmed the suitability for topical application, making CLT-NEs a great tool for clinical investigation of topical candidiasis treatments.

AB Tablet final properties are mainly determined during the compaction process by the evolution of the stresses applied to the powder. Any process or product parameter that may influence this stress evolution may have a direct impact on the tablet final properties. In this article, we studied the influence of the friction between the tooling and the powder on the evolution of the die-wall pressure during compaction using flat and concave punches.
   Experimental studies were performed on microcrystalline cellulose as well as numerical studies using finite element method (FEM) simulation. Both methodologies indicate that increasing the friction between the powder and the tooling promotes an increase in the die-wall pressure during tableting. This is in contradiction with results that can be found in the literature.
   Moreover, the results of this study showed that for flat punches, the stress evolution is mainly driven by the die/powder friction. On the contrary, for concave punches, changing the punches/powder friction have also a consequence in the evolution of the die-wall pressure. This could have practical consequences in sticking situations where, due film formation on the punches, the friction between the punches and the powder may change during tableting.

AB The aim of this study was to develop a self-emulsifying drug delivery system (SEDDS) containing the glycopeptide antibiotic vancomycin (VAN) with improved intestinal mucosa permeating properties in order to increase oral drug absorption. VAN was effectively incorporated into SEDDS increasing the lipophilicity of the drug via hydrophobic ion pairing (HIP) with cetyltrimethylammonium bromid (CTAB). Newly developed SEDDS formulations containing VAN/CTAB complex were characterized with respect to droplet size, polydispersity index and zeta potential. Furthermore, permeating properties were investigated in porcine intestinal mucus using Transwell setup and on freshly excised porcine intestinal mucosa utilizing Ussing-type chamber. In addition, minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of VAN/CTAB-SEDDS against Staphylococcus aureus was evaluated. The developed formulations F1 (25% Capmul 808G EP/NF, 37.5% Cremophor RH 40, 37.5%), F2 (26.5% Capmul 808G EP/NF, 33.2% Cremophor RH 40, 13.8% Transcutol, 26.5% DMSO) and F3 (28.8% Captex 8000, 35% Cremophor EL, 20% Transcutol, 16.2% DMSO) with a mean droplet size of 14 nm, 15 nm and 153 nm, respectively, exhibited improved ability to permeate porcine intestinal mucosal barrier. F1-VAN/CTAB showed 219-fold, F2-VAN/CTAB 46-fold and F3-VAN/CTAB 63-fold higher permeation of VAN through the mucus layer after 4 h in comparison to free VAN. Moreover, all formulations demonstrated a 4-8-fold improvement in permeation of intestinal mucosa compared to free VAN solution. Additionally, F2-VAN/CTAB with a MIC of 0.313 mg/L showed higher effectivity against S. aureus (ATCC (R) 29213) compared to free VAN. According to these results, HIP combined with SEDDS should be taken into consideration as promising tool for oral antibiotic delivery.

AB Tocopherol-based lipids are widely used for nucleic acid delivery. Using tocopherol molecules, we designed and synthesized 5-HT functionalized lipids by tethering 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT), a small molecule ligand as the head group to a natural amphiphilic molecule namely alpha-tocopherol (Vitamin E). This is with the aim of delivering nucleic acids specifically into cells expressing the serotonin receptors (5-hydroxytryptamine[5-HT]) which are abundant in the central nervous system. In order to achieve target recognition, we adopted an approach wherein two structurally different lipid molecules having serotonin as the head group was conjugated to tocopherol via different linkers thus generating lipids with either free -NH2 or -OH moiety. The corresponding lipids designated as Lipid A (Tocopheryl carbonate serotonin-NH2) and Lipid B (Tocopheryl 2-hydroxy propyl ammonium serotonin-OH), were formulated with co-lipids 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphatidyl-ethanolamine (DOPE) and 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-sn-3-phosphatidylcholine (DOPC) and evaluated for their ability to deliver plasmid DNA through reporter gene expression assays in vitro. Furthermore, the physicochemical characteristics and cellular interactions of the formulations were examined using serotonin-receptor enriched cells in order to distinguish the structural and functional attributes of both lipids. Cell-based gene expression studies reveal that in comparison to Lipid A, a formulation of Lipid B prepared with DOPE as the co-lipid, contributes to efficient uptake leading to significant enhancement in transfection. Specific interactions explored by molecular docking studies suggests the role of the hydroxyl moiety and the enantiospecific significance of serotonin- conjugated tocopherol lipids in recognizing these receptors thus signifying a promising lipid-based approach to target the serotonin receptors in the central nervous system.

AB Prolonged drug release provided by multiple-unit dosage forms is highly beneficial to enhance the compliance and safety of the pharmacotherapy even for patients with swallowing deficiencies. To facilitate the intake for these patients, multiple-unit tablets and capsules have to be crushed or opened. An attempt to overcome these issues has been made by the introduction of orodispersible films (ODFs), which rapidly disintegrate within the oral cavity and facilitate the intake of oral solid dosage forms. The aim of this study was to develop a rapidly disintegrating ODF with prolonged release properties by incorporation of small-sized micropellets (MPs). MPs with a drug load of 70% were produced by wet extrusion and spheronization using Vivapur (R) MCG as pelletizing aid and diclofenac sodium (DS) as model drug. MPs were film-coated with an Eudragit (R) RS/RL coating and incorporated into the ODF-forming hypromellose solution. ODFs were produced by solvent casting technique. Disintegration times were determined using the PharmaTest (R) disintegration tester equipped with sample holders for ODFs. Dissolution studies were performed for MPs and ODFs. X-ray micro-computed tomography was used to visualize internal and external surface structures of MPs before and after release studies. MP-loaded ODFs show fast disintegration within 30 s, whereby film-coated MPs remain intact. Uncoated MPs are disintegrating thus revealing immediate DS release. In comparison, DS release was prolonged for film-coated MPs and corresponding ODFs. Incorporation of different amounts of MPs had no effect on the dissolution, but on mechanical properties of ODFs, which decrease with increasing amounts of MPs.
   The production of rapidly disintegrating ODFs with prolonged release properties for DS, representing a freely water-soluble drug, was feasible.

AB Doxorubicin loaded in poloxamer 188-coated PLGA nanoparticles (Dox-NP + P188) was shown to produce a high antitumor effect against the experimental orthotopic 101.8 glioblastoma in rats upon intravenous administration. The objective of the present study was to evaluate the acute and chronic toxicity of this nanoformulation. The parent drug was used as a reference formulation. Acute toxicity of doxorubicin-loaded nanoparticles in mice and rats was similar to that of free doxorubicin. The chronic toxicity study was conducted in Chinchilla rabbits; the treatment regimen consisted of 30 daily intravenous injections using two dosage levels: 0.22 mg/kg/day and 0.15 mg/kg/day. The study included assessment of the body weight, hematological parameters, blood biochemical parameters, urinalysis, and pathomorphological evaluation of the internal organs.
   The results of the study demonstrated that the hematological, cardiac, and testicular toxicity of doxorubicin could be reduced by binding the drug to PLGA nanoparticles. Coating of PLGA nanoparticles with poloxamer 188 contributed to the reduction of cardiotoxicity. Functional and morphological abnormalities caused by the nanoparticulate doxorubicin were dose-dependent and reversible. Altogether these results provide evidence that the PLGA-based nanoformulation not only might enable the broadening of the spectrum of doxorubicin activity but also an improvement of its safety profile.

AB Oral delivery of dispersible tablets is a preferred route of administration for paediatrics due to ease of administration and dose control. Milk has gained interest as a drug delivery system due to its ability to dissolve poorly water-soluble drugs. There are no reports of milk tablet formulations being assessed in the context of lipid digestion, which is critical in influencing orally administered drug solubility and bioavailability. Milk-drug tablets were formulated by blending freeze-dried bovine milk or infant formula with the poorly water-soluble drug cinnarizine, which were directly compressed. Tablet strength, friability and dispersibility were quantified and synchrotron X-ray scattering was used to determine the lipid liquid crystalline phases formed during in vitro digestion of dispersed tablets and their effects on drug solubilisation. Tableting had a significant impact on the self-assembly of lipids in redispersed milk tablets whereas no effect was seen for infant formula tablets. Incorporation of the disintegrant poly(vinylpolypyrrolidone) to reduce tablet dispersion times promoted the formation of hexagonal liquid crystalline phases upon digestion but had minimal effect on drug solubilisation. These findings show that similar to the use of liquid milk, the formulation of milk-drug tablets can be used to improve solubilisation of poorly water-soluble drugs.

AB Solid dispersions production is one of the substantial approaches for improvement of poor drug solubility. Additionally, supercritical fluid assisted method for preparation of solid dispersions can offer many advantages in comparison to the conventional melting or solvent-evaporation methods. Miscibility analysis provides valuable guidance for selection of the most appropriate polymeric carrier for dispersion of the drug of interest. In addition to the increased drug release rate, solid dispersions should have proper mechanical attributes in order to be successfully formulated in the final solid dosage form such as tablet. Therefore, several pharmaceutical grade polymers have been selected for development of BCS Class II drug carvedilol (CARV) solid dispersions. They were compared based on behavior in supercritical CO2 and affinity towards CARV calculated from the miscibility analysis. By utilization of the supercritical CO2 assisted method, solid dispersions of CARV with the selected (co) polymers (polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP), hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC), Soluplus (R) and Eudragit (R)) were obtained. Properties of the prepared CARV-polymer dispersions were observed by the polarizing and scanning electron microscopy and analyzed by differential scanning calorimetry and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. CARV was additionally characterized by X-ray powder diffraction. Furthermore, in vitro dissolution studies and dynamic compaction analysis were performed on the selected samples of solid dispersions. Among the studied polymers, PVP and HPMC have been identified as polymers with the highest affinity towards CARV, based on the calculated delta(p) values. This has been also confirmed with the highest dissolution efficiency of CARV-PVP and CARV-HPMC solid dispersions. Solid state characterization indicated that CARV was dispersed either molecularly, or in the amorphous form, depending on interactions with each polymer. Determination of CARV-PVP and CARV-HPMC mechanical properties revealed that CARV-PVP solid dispersion has superior compactibility and tabletability. Therefore, CARV-PVP solid dispersion has been highlighted as the most appropriate for the further development of tablets as the final dosage form. Presented study provides an example for efficient approach for development of poorly soluble drug solid dispersion with satisfactory tableting properties.

AB Wet milling coupled with crystallisation has considerable potential to deliver enhanced control over particle attributes. The effect of process conditions and wet mill configuration on particle size, shape and surface energy has been investigated on acetaminophen using a seeded cooling crystallisation coupled with a wet mill unit generating size controlled acetaminophen crystals through an interchangeable rotor-tooth configuration. The integrated wet milling crystallisation platform incorporates inline focused beam reflectance measurement (FBRM) and particle vision measurement (PVM) for in-depth understanding of particle behaviour under high-shear conditions. We used a recently developed computational tool for converting chord length distribution (CLD) from FBRM to particle size distribution (PSD) to obtain quantitative insight into the effect of the competing mechanisms of size reduction and growth in a wet milling seeded crystallisation process for acetaminophen. The novelty of our wet milling crystallisation approach is in delivery of consistent surface energies across a range of particle sizes. This highlights the potential to engineer desirable particle attributes through a carefully designed, highly intensified crystallisation process.

AB Nanoparticles (NPs) can be used to locally deliver anti-restenosis drugs when they are infused directly to the injured arteries after intervention procedures such as angioplasty. However, the efficacy of transferring NPs via infusion to the arterial wall is limited, at least partially, due to poor NP retention on the inner artery wall. To improve NP retention, angioplasty balloons coated with drug-loaded NPs were fabricated via either layer-by-layer (LbL) electrostatic coating or acrylic-based hydrogel (AAH) coating techniques. Three types of NPs, namely poly (lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA), biodegradable photo-luminescent PLGA and urethane doped polyester were studied. The transfer efficacy of NPs from various coatings to the arterial wall were further evaluated to find the optimal coating conditions. The ex vivo NP transfer studies showed significantly more NPs being transferred to the rat arterial wall after the angioplasty procedure by the AAH coating (95% transfer efficiency) compared to that of the LbL technique (60%) and dip coating (20%) under flow conditions (10 dyn/cm(2)). Our results suggest that the AAH coating of drug-loaded NPs on the angioplasty balloon could potentially provide superior retention of drug-loaded NPs onto the arterial wall for a better local delivery of drug-loaded NPs to effectively treat arterial diseases.

AB Gelatin nanoparticles (GNPs) are one of the most extensively used natural polymers for gene therapy. With advantages of being biodegradable, biocompatible, low cost and easily modified, gelatin holds great promise as a non-viral system for gene delivery. This review examines various methods of preparation of modified gelatin nanoparticles and considers how these modifications apply to gene delivery. The article discusses cationic gelatin, PEGylated gelatin, thiolated gelatin, alendronate gelatin, and EGFR gelatin nanoparticles. This article also considers several advantages of these modifications and their contribution to the improvement in the efficiency of these systems, resulting in superior transfection and enhanced gene delivery in general.

AB The objective of this present study was to develop and evaluate the triptolide-loaded nanostructured lipid carriers (TPL-NLCs) for transdermal drug delivery system (TDDS). TPL-NLCs was prepared with emulsification technique and optimized by central composite design of a response surface methodology (CCD-RSM). The optimized TPL-NLCs were spherical and physically stable with the average size of 139.6.0 +/- 2.53 nm and Zeta potential of -36.03 +/- 2.41 mV. The encapsulation efficiency and drug loading were 97.15% +/- 9.46 and 10.35% +/- 1.12, respectively. Moreover, the in vitro release study showed that TPL-NLCs had a sustained release profiles and the in vitro penetration study indicated that TPL-NLCs could effectively penetrate into skin. Besides, the methodology of skin-blood synchronous microdialysis was established to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of TPL-NLCs in vivo and the results displayed that the TPL concentration in skin was higher than that in blood. And TPL-NLCs presented a remarkable effect of decreasing knee edema, inhibiting inflammation by regulating the levels of TNF-alpha, IL-1 beta and IL-6, which indicated that TPL-NLCs was a promising topical administration in treatment of edema and inflammation associated with rheumatoid arthritis (RA).

AB In this study, we loaded a biomimetic calcium phosphate bone cement (CPC) with relatively high amounts of a bisphosphonate through the use of Solid Lipid Microparticles (MPs) and investigated bone cells response to the composite cements. 10, 20 and 30% w/w of Alendronate (AL) were successfully introduced into microparticles of Cutina HR and Precirol, which were prepared by means of spray-congealing technique. Addition of AL-loaded MPs to the cement composition provoked a lengthening of the setting and of the hardening processes. However, setting times were still in a range useful for clinical applications, except for the cements at the highest Alendronate content. The composite cements displayed a sustained drug release over time. Cements with the best performances in terms of setting, hardening, mechanical properties and drug release were submitted to in vitro tests using a co-culture model of osteoblast and osteoclast. The results showed that the use of MPs to enrich the cement composition with Alendronate provides materials able to inhibit osteoclast viability and activity, while promoting osteoblast viability and earlier differentiation, indicating that the MPs-cements are good delivery systems for bisphosphonates.

AB Abundant efforts have recently been made to design potent theranostic nanoparticles, which combine diagnostic and therapeutic agents, for the effective treatment of cancer. In this study, we developed multifunctional magnetic gold nanoparticles (MGNPs) that are able to (i) selectively deliver the drug to the tumor site in a controlled-release manner, either passively or by using magnetic targeting; (ii) induce photothermal therapy by producing heat by near-infrared (NIR) laser absorption; and (iii) serve as contrast agents for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (imaging-guided therapy). The prepared MGNPs were characterized by different physical techniques. They were then coated and conjugated with polyethylene glycol (PEG) and doxorubicin (DOX) to form MGNP-DOX conjugates. The high efficacy of MGNP-DOX for combined chemo-photothermal therapy was observed both in vitro and in vivo. The effectiveness of MGNP-DOX as theranostic nanoparticles was confirmed by histopathological examination and immunohistochemical studies. Moreover, MGNP-DOX showed good potential as MRI contrast agents for guided chemo-photothermal synergistic therapy.

AB The aim of the present research work was to formulate, optimize and evaluate the in-situ gel for the ophthalmic drug delivery using the combination of gellan gum and carbopol 934P. The Box-Behnken design was applied to optimize the concentration of gellan gum (X-1), carbopol 934P (X-2) and benzododecenium bromide (X-3) to achieve the maximum viscosity [at physiological condition; 35 degrees C, pH 7.4, and simulated tear fluid (STF)], mucoadhesive strength, permeability coefficient and sustained release of the drug from the gel with constraint on the viscosity under the non-physiological condition (25 degrees C, pH 5). Response surface plots were drawn, the statistical validity of the polynomials was established, and optimized formulation was selected by the feasibility and grid search. The design proposed the optimized batch by selecting the independent variables as gellan gum (0.55% w/v), carbopol 934P (0.35% w/v) and benzododecenium bromide (0.013% w/v) to achieve the maximum viscosity (3363 cps) at physiological condition, mucoadhesive strength (22.35 dyn/cm(2)), t(90%) (1200 min), permeability coefficient (1.36 x 10(-5) sq.cm/sec), with minimum viscosity (131 cps) under the non-physiological condition. The combination of gellan gum and carbopol 934P improved the gelation (synergistic effect) characteristics of the in situ gel. The optimized in situ gel was clear, isotonic, pH 4.7 and showed pseudoplastic flow, high in vitro gelling capacity, low contact angle, acceptable hardness (51018 gm), compressibility (64617 gm) and adhesiveness (74 gm) values for the ocular application. The ex vivo study showed the significant protection of the mast cell from the degranulation. The ocular irritation and histopathology studies in the rabbit eyes confirmed the safety of in situ gel for human use. The in vivo drug release studies showed the presence of drug in the rabbit tear fluid up to 3 h in comparison to just 1 h with the eye drop solution. The contact time of the in situ gel in the human eye was 15.0 +/- 2.5 mm, which was > 2 folds higher than the marketed gel (6.0 +/- 3.2 min), which could reduce the dosing frequency and total dose of drug. The Box-Behnken design facilitated the optimization of in situ gel for sustained ophthalmic drug delivery.

AB The aim of this work is to test the in vivo behavior of a mucoadhesive vaginal emulsion resistant to the clearance of vaginal fluids using ciprofloxacin (CPX) as an anti-infective model of drug. CPX is a broad-spectrum antibiotic used in the treatment of sexual tissues infections, as intravenous injection in a dose of 20 mg every 12 h. In this study, CPX was incorporated in water in silicone (W/S) mucoadhesive emulsions and the in vivo residence time and the CPX in vivo absorption and distribution to the sexual organs was studied using the rat as animal model. W/S emulsion shows excellent in vitro bioadhesion having high resistance to the vaginal fluids clearance. The drug release profiles show a constant release of CPX during at least 6 h according to a zero-order kinetics. In vivo computerized PET/CT Image Analysis after intravaginal administration to rats indicates that W/S emulsions remain in the vaginal area for a long time and shows a good absorption of the radiotracers used as markers through the vaginal mucosa. Ciprofloxacin pharmacokinetic studies developed after the single intravaginal administration of W/S emulsion shows a good absorption and distribution of CPX on the uterus and ovarian tissue. A significant concentration of CPX in the sexual tissues was observed after 24 h of administration of W/S emulsion. Therefore, W/S emulsions have a good in vivo residence and drug release in the vaginal mucosae showing a great potential for the treatment of sexual tissues infections, as vaginal bioadhesive delivery systems of antinfectious drugs.

AB Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are regarded as next-generation antibiotics to replace conventional antibiotics due to their rapid and broad-spectrum antimicrobial properties and far less sensitivity to the development of pathogen resistance. However, they are susceptible to proteolysis in vivo by endogenous or bacterial proteases as well as induce the lysis of red blood cells, which prevent their intravenous applications. In this work, polyion complex (PIC) micelles of the cationic AMP MSI-78 and the anionic copolymer methoxy poly(ethylene glycol)-b-poly(alpha-glutamic acid) (mPEG-b-PGlu) were prepared to develop novel antimicrobial agents for potential application in vivo. With an increase in molar ratio of mPEG-b-PGlu to MSI-78, the complexation ability of the PIC micelles increased. FITC-labeled MSI-78 showed a sustained release from the PIC micelles. More importantly, these PIC micelles greatly decreased the hemolytic toxicity of MSI-78 to human red blood cells, without influencing its antimicrobial activity. Thus, this approach could be used as a suitable in vivo delivery method of AMPs in the future.

AB The rheological characteristics of pastes for 3D printing of tablets may not be described fully by the traditional rheological tests generally used for other pastes. In the present study, extrudability testing of carbopol based 3D printing pastes was performed to establish a constitutive rheological model for micro-extrusion. This model was developed for pastes that exhibit a non-linear plasto-viscoelastic behavior and follow the generalized Herschel-Bulkley flow rule. An analytical model was applied to extrudability data obtained by micro-extrusion through nozzles of 0.4 and 0.6 mm diameters. For this purpose, nineteen pastes were prepared per a fractional factorial design using various concentrations of the active ingredient and soluble and insoluble excipients. Critical material parameters (sigma(0), k and n) of the pastes were then calculated by analyzing extrudability data using a constitutive equation relating flow rate, nozzle and cartridge diameters, printing pressure and slip-flow angle. The accuracy of the constitutive model to predict paste yield stress, consistency and flow indices was evident by low RMSE values of 0.0691 bar, 0.034 and 6.3 bar/s(n), respectively. Yield stress, flow and consistency parameters of the pastes were significantly affected by percentages of soluble and swellable excipients. The nozzle diameter had significant effect on flow index (n) but not on the consistency index (k). Hence, this study provides a mechanistic model to characterize the complex rheological behavior of pastes for 3D printing of tablets by a micro-extrusion process.

AB The objective of this study was to formulate aripiprazole (ARI)-loaded pH-modulated solid dispersions (SD) to enhance solubility, dissolution, and bioavailability via hot-melt extrusion (HME) technology. Kollidon (R) 12 PF (PVP) and succinic acid (SA) were selected after solubility screenings of various polymers and acidifiers. Several formulations, varying in screw speed and drug/polymer/acidifier ratios, were extruded using an 11 mm twin-screw extruder and were investigated for the effect of these variables. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and X-ray diffraction (XRD) were used to perform solid-state characterizations of the pure drug and extrudates. The aqueous solubility and dissolution were evaluated for the pure drug and milled extrudates. Among the prepared formulations, N6 was chosen for in vivo absorption studies. Solid-state characterization demonstrated the transformation of the crystalline ARI to an amorphous state in the formulations. Each formulation showed increased solubility and dissolution compared to the drug powder. The oral bioavailability (C-max and AUC(0-12)) of N6 was significantly improved when compared to the pure ARI. This novel study not only discusses the incorporation of acidifiers in SDs but also the preparation of SDs using HME technology as effective techniques to improve drug release and bioavailability.

AB Drug coated balloons (DCBs) have proven to be a suitable alternative for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases. They allow for uniform delivery of an antiproliferative drug to the stenotic site without permanent implantation of the device in the patient's body. There are, however, regulatory concerns regarding the lack of data associated with variable drug delivery to the target site, which can be related to the coaling process. This study describes the process for an in-house micro-pipetting coaling method that incorporates a laboratory-developed coaling equation for determining optimal coaling parameters. The coaling solutions included a common drug of choice, paclitaxel, along with a hydrophilic excipient, such as iopromide. It was found that using a revolution rate of 240 rev/min, a flow rate of 25 mu L/min and a translational speed of 0.033 cm/s resulted in visually uniform coatings. High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) allowed for the determination of paclitaxel content on the balloon surface. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) enabled analysis of coaling thickness and texture at distal, middle, and proximal positions on the balloon; average thicknesses were determined to be 16.4 +/- 5.8, 14.8 +/- 1.4, and 18.1 +/- 3.9 mu m, respectively. These optimized coaling conditions have been confirmed by in vitro drug release kinetics studies. Overall this study generated a simple and reproducible micro-pipetting coaling method for the sustained release of drugs from the drug coated balloons.

ID DELIVERY
AB It was previously demonstrated that the loss of infectivity of a myovirus PEV44 after jet nebulization was closely related to a change in bacteriophage (phage) structure. In this follow-up study, we further examined the impact of jet nebulization on tailed phages, which constitute 96% of all known phages, from three different families, Podoviridae (PEV2), Myoviridae (PEV40) and Siphoviridae (D29). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) identified major changes in phage structures after jet nebulization, correlating with their loss of infectivity. For the podovirus PEV2, jet nebulization had a negligible impact on its activity (0.04 log(10) pfu/mL loss) and structural change. On the other hand, the proportion of intact phages in the nebulized samples dropped from 50% to similar to 27% for PEV40 and from 15% to similar to 2% for D29. Phage deactivation of PEV40 measured by the TEM structural damage (0.52 log(10) pfu/mL) was lower than that obtained by plaque assay (1.02 log(10) pfu/mL), but within the range of variation ( +/- 0.5 log(10) pfu/mL). However, TEM quantification considerably underestimated the titer reduction of D29 phage, similar to 2 log pfu/mL lower than that obtained in plaque assay (3.25 log(10) pfu/mL loss). In conclusion, nebulization-induced titre loss was correlated with morphological damage to phages and in particular, the tail length may be an important consideration for selection of phages in inhaled therapy using jet nebulization.

AB The inability of traditional chemotherapeutics to reach cancer tissue reduces the treatment efficacy and leads to adverse effects. A multifunctional nanovector was developed consisting of porous silicon, superparamagnetic iron oxide, calcium carbonate, doxorubicin and polyethylene glycol. The particles integrate magnetic properties with the capacity to retain drug molecules inside the pore matrix at neutral pH to facilitate drug delivery to tumor tissues. The MRI applicability and pH controlled drug release were examined in vitro together with indepth material characterization. The in vivo biodistribution and compound safety were verified using A549 lung cancer bearing mice before proceeding to therapeutic experiments using CT26 cancer implanted mice. Loading doxorubicin into the porous nanoparticle negated the adverse side effects encountered after intravenous administration highlighting the particles' excellent biocompatibility. Furthermore, the multifunctional nanovector induced 77% tumor reduction after intratumoral injection. The anti-tumor effect was comparable with that of free doxorubicin but with significantly alleviated unwanted effects. These results demonstrate that the developed porous silicon-based nanoparticles represent promising multifunctional drug delivery vectors for cancer monitoring and therapy.

AB In this study, a new alternative of ionic crosslinked nanoparticles (NPs) based on chitosan (C) and bovine serum albumin (A; BSA) was evaluated as drug delivery system for antitumour compounds (doxorubicin hydrochloride as a model). The different responses to the pH of the medium were determined by the electrostatic interactions induced by each polymeric combination (C50/A50; C80/A20; C20/A80). NPs revealed a nanoscale size (167-392 nm) and a positive net charge (12-26 mV), modulated by doxorubicin (DOX) loading. Drug loading capacity was higher than 5.2 +/- 1.8 mu gDOX/mgNP (Encapsulation efficiency = 34%), and an initial burst release was followed by a sustained delivery. Cellular uptake assays confirmed the entry of NPs in three human tumor cells (MCF7, T47D and Hela), triggering antioxidant responses (superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione reductase and total glutathione content) in those cells. This was also consistent with the decreased in IC50 values observed after the incubation of these cells with C20/A80-DOX and C50/A50-DOX NPs (1.90-3.48 mu g/mL) compared with free DOX (2.36-6.025 mu g/mL). In vivo results suggested that the selected proportions of chitosan-BSA created nonhemolytic and biocompatible stable NPs at the selected dose of 20 mg/kg. Despite the different formulations, this study demonstrated that these NPs could serve as safe drug carriers in further in vivo investigations.

TI Rethinking carbamazepine oral delivery using polymer-lipid hybrid

AB Epilepsy is the most common chronic brain disorder and affects millions of people worldwide. Carbamazepine (CBZ) is one of the first-line pharmacological therapy instituted to patients due to its wide spectrum of action. Although marketed for more than 30 years, CBZ efficacy is strongly limited by its lateral effects, and variable and slow intestinal absorption. This reality leads to resistance drug development, which compromises the patients' quality of life. Rethinking about CBZ oral delivery is required to achieve a more effective strategy for the treatment of epilepsy.
   This work aimed at developing polymer-lipid hybrid nanoparticles, using chitosan as the polymer coaling, as a surrogate nanosystem for oral administration of CBZ. The hybrid nanoparticles were produced by high-pressure homogenization, and a systematic evaluation was carried out in terms of particle size, zeta potential, loading properties, mucoadhesion, stability and in vitro - in vivo performance assessment, including release, intestinal permeability, and biodistribution studies. Subsequently, nanoparticles were spray-dried and tableted to provide a differentiated solid dosage form.
   Chitosan coaling improved lipid nanoparticle stability under gastric environment, presenting a size of ca. 150 nm and a polydispersity index smaller than 0.150, and increasing up to two orders of magnitude the drug intestinal permeability.
   The in vivo studies herein performed evidenced that hybrid nanoparticles prompted a similar brain disposition of CBZ to that of an oral suspension, after the administration of a lower dose. These findings are consistent with a controlled and reproducible release pattern, suggesting that the therapeutic effect is ensured with lower adverse effects.
   The present work may provide a proof-of-concept for further preclinical studies in the treatment of epilepsy.

AB Up to 50% of Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis patients suffer from ileo-colonic inflammation. Topically delivered budesonide is an effective treatment but in vitro as well as clinical data suggest that oral formulations currently used in clinical practice are not optimal to treat the ileo-colon. The aim of this in vitro study was to develop ileo-colonic-targeted zero-order sustained-release tablets containing 3 mg or 9 mg budesonide. Targeted delivery was achieved by coating the tablets with the ColoPulse technology (ColoPulse 3 mg or ColoPulse 9 mg, respectively). Tablets were tested in a 10-h gastrointestinal simulation system for site-specific release, zero-order release kinetics (R-2 >= 0.950), release rate, and completeness of release (>= 80%). Release profiles of the novel formulations were compared with Entocort, Budenofalk, and Cortiment (budesonide MMX). ColoPulse 3 mg and 9 mg were targeted to the simulated ileo-colon, budesonide release was complete and in a sustained zero-order manner, and both formulations complied with a 6-month accelerated stability study. None of the formulations currently used in clinical practice targeted the ileo-colon. These in vitro results are discussed in light of clinical data. ColoPulse 3 mg and 9 mg are novel interesting formulations for the treatment of the entire ileo-colon in inflammatory bowel disease.

ID INJECTION FORCES; NEEDLE; PAIN
AB Injectability is a term related to the ease of parenteral administration of a dosing solution, and includes dose preparation, dose administration, ergonomics related to these procedures, pain of injection, and other adverse events at the injection site. This article focuses on force measurements related to injectability, namely: force to expel syringe contents (expulsion force - a mimic for in vivo injection force), needle-penetration force, and needle-bending force, and these results are supplemented by expulsion time measurements with 18 participants, as well as injections in a porcine model. Based on the expulsion time measurements, where 80 N injection force was found to be difficult for most people, we consider the maximum acceptable injection force to be 40 N, and recommend targeting no more than 20 N, especially if the configuration may be used in an autoinjector or similar device. The injectability of antisense oligonucleotide solutions was assessed to determine optimal dosing materials (among those evaluated) for a variety of solution viscosities. Dosing materials varied in syringe inner diameter, needle inner diameter, needle length, and needle wall thickness: standard-wall vs. thin-wall. In general, short (6-8 mm) thin-wall needles are recommended as a way to improve patient perception and comfort during subcutaneous dose administration.

AB This study describes the effect of coating temperature on the performance of mechanical particle coating using ethylcellulose, which was done to produce controlled-release particles (diameters less than 100 mu m) with different release rates. First, theophylline crystals were spheronized using a mechanical powder processor, yielding theophylline spheres (used as core particles). Second, ethylcellulose aqueous dispersion was powdered by spray-freeze drying to prepare colloidal agglomerates (used as coating powder). Finally, the spheres and agglomerates were mechanically mixed at various temperatures using the processor to produce composite particles. The ethylcellulose agglomerates were pulverized during processing to coat the theophylline spheres effectively. When the coating temperature was higher than the glass transition temperature (T-g) of ethylcellulose, the amount of coated polymer increased significantly due to plastics deformation, causing thickening of the coated layer. The porosity of the coated layer decreased upon coalescence of coated polymer particles due to plastic deformation, which prevented the appearance of cracks in the film during curing. Therefore, controlled-release fine particles with various release rates can be produced effectively by mechanical particle coating at temperatures higher than the T-g of the polymer.

AB This paper develops a methodology to estimate the break force of curved faced tablets under diametrical compression. Common excipients used in pharmaceutical tablet formulations, including microcrystalline cellulose, calcium phosphate and mannitol as well as their mixtures were characterised. Compacts of different densities were manufactured and their compressive and tensile strength was measured. The break force of curved face tablets having a comprehensive range of face curvatures and thickness was measured using the diametrical compression method ("hardness" test). Equation sigma(d) =F/(2)(pi D)(a(t)/(D)+b(W)/(D))(-1) introduced by Shang et al. (2013) was used to relate the break force (F) to tablet geometry (D, t, W) and material tensile strength (sigma(d)). Here, we propose a method to estimate the parameters a and b using data for flat faced tablets. The method was validated for four mixtures. The errors were analysed and compared with the USP29 method sigma(d) =(10F)/(pi D2)(2.84(t/D)-0.126(t/W) + 3.15(W/D)+0.01)(-1). The proposed method has better accuracy, however, requires additional characterisation of the compressive strength of the material.

AB UV and NIR-responsive monoolein cubic phase was prepared by including poly(ethyleneimine) (PEI)/cinnamic acid (CA) conjugate and gold nanoparticle (GNP) within its structure. UV irradiation elevated significantly the release % of Auramine O loaded in cubic phase containing PEI/CA, possibly because of the trans-to-cis isomerization of CA. NIR irradiation also increased significantly the release % of FITC-dextran loaded in cubic phase containing PEI/CA. The release % of the dye loaded in cubic phase containing PEI/CA and GNP was elevated more markedly by NIR irradiation, possibly due to the phase transition of cubic phase and the disassembling of PEI/CA assembly.

AB Angiopoietin-like protein 8 (ANGPTL8) is associated with reduced HDL-cholesterol levels and may contribute to the development of dyslipidemia. Factors regulating ANGPTL8 expression remain poorly understood. Here we analyzed the relationship between miRNA-143-3p and ANGPTL8 in liver cells. Using target prediction algorithms, we identified a putative binding site for miR-143-3p in the ANGPTL8 3' untranslated region (3'UTR). Exogenous miR-143-3p interacted with the ANGPTL8 3'UTR to downregulate its expression compared to scrambled sequence control. Transfection of HepG2 cells with miR-143-3p mimic or siRNA resulted in decreased or increased ANGPTL8 transcript and protein levels, respectively. Treatment of HepG2 cells with 30 mM glucose, 100 nM insulin, or 75 ng/ml lipopolysaccharide to mimic hyperglycemic, hyperinsulinemic, and proinflammatory conditions corresponded with increased miR-143-3p and ANGPTL8 levels. Inhibition of miR-143-3p amplified ANGPTL8 response to these treatments, suggesting that the miRNA acts to suppress ANGPTL8 expression under metabolically distorted conditions. These results, combined with growing evidence supporting a role for ANGPTL8 in the regulation of HDL-C metabolism, provide a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying ANGPTL8 expression.

AB Proline-rich protein 11 (PRR11) has been shown to play an critical roles in the development of cancer. However, the clinical significance and the biological role of PRR11 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains unknown. The present study aimed to investigate the expression pattern, prognostic value and the biological role of PRR11 in HCC. PRR11 expression in 80 HCC surgical specimens was examined, and its clinical significance was analyzed. The role of PRR11 in cell proliferation, colony formation, migration and invasion were also determined. The results showed that PRR11 mRNA was significantly up-regulated in 56.25% (45/80) HCC from that in matched adjacent non-tumor tissues. High PRR11 was correlated with tumor size (P = 0.01) and TNM stage (P = 0.006). Patients with higher PRR11 expression had poor overall survival time (P < 0.001). Furthermore, PRR11 silencing obviously inhibited cell proliferation, colony formation, as well as cell migration and invasion of HCC cell lines in vitro. Mechanistically, knockdown of PRR11 significantly decreased the expression of beta-catenin, cyclinD1, c-myc and N-cadherin in HCC cell lines. Additionally, the inhibitory effects of PRR11 silencing on cell migration was significantly enhanced by beta-catenin inhibition. PRR11 mRNA expression was found positively correlated with beta-catenin (R = 0.5472, P(<)0.0001), c-myc (R = 0.5527, P(<)0.0001) and cyclinD1 (R = 0.3948, P = 0.0003) in HCC tissues. Collectively, our data demonstrate that PRR11 plays an oncogenic role in HCC progression, through activating the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway, and may represent a valuable prognostic marker and therapeutic target for HCC.

AB Objective: This study aimed to identifying and validating therapeutic compounds which might have positive effects on patients with gastric cancer (GC) based on weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) and connectivity map (CMap).
   Methods: We performed WGCNA to gain insights into the molecular aspects of GC. Raw microarray datasets (including 132 samples) were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) website. We utilized the WGCNA to identify the coexpressed genes (modules) and modular hub genes after non-specific filtering. Furthermore, these differentially expressed genes were submitted to CMap analysis to identify candidate therapeutic compounds for GC. In experimental part, cell growth inhibition was evaluated by Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) and colony formation assays. Tumor growth was assessed using nude mice with xenografts established in vivo. QRT-PCR and western blot were used for determination of HDAC2 expression level and immunohistochemistry was performed to quantify HDAC2 in gastric tumor samples.
   Results: Through WGCNA and CMap analysis, we found two potential therapeutic compounds, the valproic acid (VPA), which is the histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor and lovastatin. HDAC2 was overexpressed in gastric cancer cell lines including AGS, BGC-823, NCI-N87 and MKN28. Dose-dependent inhibition of gastric cancer cells by VPA and lovastatin was verified in vitro. Apoptosis of GC cells was induced after treatment with VPA and lovastatin through suppressing HDAC2 expression. Furthermore, the inhibition of VPA with cisplatin and lovastatin with cisplatin were also dose-dependent and cisplatin exhibited synergistic effects. In the xenografts, similar results were found.
   Conclusion: WGCNA was able to identify significant groups of genes associated with cancer prognosis. Moreover, analysis of gene expression signature using CMap is a powerful way to explore potential therapeutics for human diseases. For treating GC, lovastatin may be a potential drug.

AB Background: Neural stem cells (NSCs) have unique biological characteristics such as continuous proliferation and multipotential differentiation, providing a possible method for restoration of central nervous system (CNS) function after injury or disease. NSCs and astrocytes share many similar biological properties including cell morphology and molecular expression and can trans-differentiate into each other under certain conditions. However, characteristic genes specifically expressed by NSCs have not been well described.
   Methods: To provide insights into the characteristic expression of NSCs, bioinformatics analysis of two micro arrays of mouse NSCs and astrocytes was performed. Compared to astrocytes, the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in NSCs were identified and annotated by GO, KEGG and GSEA analysis, respectively. Then key genes were screened by protein-protein interaction (PPI) network and modules analysis, and were verified using multiple high-throughput sequencing resources. Finally, the expression difference between the two cell types was confirmed by Real-time Quantitative PCR (qPCR), western blotting and immunochemical analysis.
   Results: In the present study, 282 and 250 NSC-enriched genes from two microarrays were identified and annotated respectively, and the 77 overlapping DEGs were then selected. From the PPI network 24 key genes in three modules were screened out. Importantly, sequencing data of tissues showed that these 24 key genes tended to be highly expressed in NSCs compared with astrocytes. Furthermore, qPCR and western blot analysis of cultured NSCs and astrocytes showed two genes (KIF2C and TOP2A) were not only differentially expressed in RNA level but also at the protein level. Importantly, the NSC-specific genes KIF2C and TOP2A were validated by immunohistochemistry in vivo.
   Conclusion: In present study, we identified 2 hub genes (KIF2C and TOP2A) that might serve as potential biomarkers for distinguishing NSCs from astrocytes, contributing to our comprehensive understanding of the bio-logical properties and functions of NSCs.

AB The CXCL12 gene produces a series of transcript variants through alternative splicing at the 3' end of its pre-mRNA. This study explores the biological activities of these alternative transcripts and the mechanisms involved in the regulation of CXCL12 transcription and RNA splicing. We identified a "GA" insertion mutation in the region of CXCL12 alpha DNA encoding the conserved 3'UTR. This variant transcript was named CXCL12-3'GA +. The mutation occurred at a frequency of 13.2% in healthy Chinese individuals. However, its frequency in healthy Caucasians was 22.6%, significantly higher than what was observed in the Chinese. Genomic analysis indicated that the GA + mutation likely encodes a G-quadruplex structure in close proximity to a cluster of important AU rich elements (AREs) that are well-established regulators of mRNA stability at the 3'UTR. Experiments using molecular constructs encoding the 3'UTR of CXCL12 revealed that the GA + allele can significantly increase gene expression compared to the WT allele. Further studies uncovered that the WT allele was associated with the production of a 225-bp minor transcript isoform (MTI) through alternative splicing resulting in the deletion of exon 2. ARMS-PCR using samples collected from cultured PBMCs of WT/GA + genotype carriers indicated that the GA + allele was preferentially transcribed compared to the WT allele. In summary, the study demonstrates that a GA insertion in the region encoding the 3'UTR of CXCL12 alpha may affect gene expression through alternative mRNA splicing. This finding provides a basis for understanding how multiple elements in the sequence encoding the 3'UTR of the CXCL12 gene regulates its transcription and may lead to insights about diseases involving abnormal CXCL12 alpha expression.

AB miRNAs have been shown to regulate a variety of biological process. It has been shown that miR-181a regulates porcine adipogenesis by targeting Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), but the overall functions of miR-181a in porcine preadipocyte differentiation remain unclear. This study aimed to explore the functions of miR-181a in porcine preadipocyte differentiation via the TGF beta/Smad pathway. The TargetScan program was used to predict miRNAs targeting TGFBR1, and miR-181a was selected as a candidate. To investigate the functions of miR-181a, miRNA mimics and inhibitors were used to overexpress or knockdown miR-181a, respectively. RT-qPCR and Western blotting were used to measure the expression of aP2, PPAR gamma, C/EBP alpha and TGFBR1 in porcine preadipocytes. Lipid accumulation and adipocyte apoptosis were detected using Oil Red O staining and flow cytometry, respectively. Taken together, our results indicated that miR-181a promoted porcine preadipocyte differentiation by directly targeting TGFBR1.

AB The tumor necrosis factor (TNF) superfamily consists of a wide variety of inflammatory cytokine, including cell bound and secreted proteins. These TNFs function through binding and activation of the TNF receptors for modulating TNF-associated intracellular signals. A set of mammalian TNF receptor-associated factors (TRAFs) that have emerged as the major signal transducers for the TNF receptor superfamily, play an important role in both adaptive and innate immunity. However, the existence of TRAFs and their biological functions in planarian are still unknown. In this study, a new member of TRAFs, DjTRAF2, was identified in planarian Dugesia japonica. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that DjTRAF2 could be a new member of the invertebrate TRAF2 family. Sequence analysis showed that the open reading frame of DjTRAF2 had 1353 bp in length and encoded a putative protein of 450 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of similar to 51.8 kDa and an isoelectric point of 7.052. Whole-mount in situ hybridization showed that DjTRAF2 was predominantly expressed in adult and regenerative pharynx, which is an important immune organ of planarian. Quantitative real-time PCR revealed that the transcriptional level of DjTRAF2 was significantly up-regulated after induced by pathogen-associated molecular patterns (polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid, lipopolysaccharide, peptidoglycan and beta-glucan), suggesting that DjTRAF2 is involved in the immune response against pathogen invasion. Collectively, these results demonstrated that DjTRAF2 might play important roles in the innate immunity of planarian.

AB Homeobox A5 (HOXA5) is a member of the HOX protein family which were implicated in serval critical process and was cancer-specific dysregulated in human cancers. However, its expression and function in human gastric cancer (GC) was still largely unknown. In this study, we confirmed for the first time that HOXA5 mRNA and protein was down-regulated in GC tissues and cell lines. Clinical data showed that low HOXA5 was significantly associated poor prognostic features, including large tumor size and advanced TNM stage. For 5-year survival, HOXA5 served as a potential prognostic marker of GC patients. Notably, HOXA5 inhibited cell viability, colony formation, proliferation, cell cycle progression and promoted apoptosis in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, we demonstrated that HOXA5 expression was regulated by miR-196a. In GC tissues, miR-196a has an inverse correlation with HOXA5 expression. Conclusively, our results demonstrated that HOXA5 functions as a tumor suppressor in regulating tumor growth of GC under regulation of miR-196a, supporting its potential utility as a therapeutic target for GC.

AB Stroke is an important neurological disease in which blood flow to the brain is interrupted and it is becoming an increasing non-communicable disease in developing countries. Current treatment options for stroke is modifying lifestyle practice, diabetes treatment, drugs, and other factors management, but yet no cure is available in sight for the disease, despite it requires new insight into the molecular and therapeutic targets. In general, MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small noncoding RNAs considered as of greater biological importance and controls molecular signaling pathways in diabetic pathogenesis. Among the reported MiRNAs, MIR-21 is considered to be an important MiRNA, which is frequently elevated in many types of types of strokes, suggesting that it plays an important role in cell proliferation, and apoptosis. Until now, there is no research paper that signifying the role of miR-21 in all types of strokes and the number of studies on the different category of strokes is limited, so in this paper, we are highlighting the recent investigations related to the significance of miR-21 in different types of strokes based on the up-to-date reports. It was found that MiR-21 was found to be normally up and down regulated in all types of strokes, however; we summarize the important research findings related to the role of miR-21 in different types of strokes.

AB Cancer stem cells (CSCs) comprise the subpopulation of tumor bulk and acquire resistant to conventional therapies and are considered as the primary tumor initiator cells. Nowadays, the tumor heterogeneity originated from CSCs, and its progenitors are accepted as a mortifying drawback in front of the cancer therapies. However, escalating knowledge gained from studies investigating the biology of CSCs will open up new frames for targeted therapies and decrease the chance of recurrence of the disease. In this review, the general understanding of CSCs and current studies were discussed briefly. Considering the latest data collected from studies of CSCs, defining the tumor heterogeneity and tumor microenvironment comprehensively will be very important to step up the cancer research.

AB Maize often exhibits asynchronous pollination under abiotic and biotic stress conditions; however, the molecular basis of this developmental deficiency has not been elucidated. Tassel development is a key process affecting the anthesis-silking interval (ASI) in maize. In this study, we showed that pollen shedding was delayed and ASI was significantly increased in B73 and Chang7-2 inbred lines under water deficit conditions, which resulted in longer barren tip length and decreased yields under both controlled and field conditions. Comparative transcriptome analysis performed on immature tassels derived from plants grown under well-watered and water deficit conditions identified 1931 and 1713 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in B73 and Chang7-2, respectively. Further, 28 differentially co-expressed transcription factors were identified across both lines. Collectively, we demonstrated that the molecular regulation of tassel development is associated with water deficit stress at early vegetative stage in maize. This finding extends our understanding of the molecular basis of maize tassel development during abiotic stress.

AB Background: Fat mass and obesity-associated protein gene variants have shown diverse influence on body weight and metabolism across different populations. Overweight, obesity and metabolic syndrome are multifactorial major health problems in the UAE and worldwide. Insulin resistance represents the link between overweight and development of metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes mellitus. We investigated two (FTO) variants in Emirati population, in relation to insulin resistance and different parameters of metabolic syndrome.
   Methods: We recruited 259 Emiratis through the UAE National Diabetes and Lifestyle Project. Ethical approval was obtained. Besides basic data collection, venous blood samples were collected. Fasting blood glucose, Lipid profile, and insulin levels were measured. Genotyping for (FTO) rs9939609 (A > T) and rs9930506 (G > A) were performed using real time-PCR. Insulin resistance were identified using HOMA2-IR calculation; with a cutoff point of 1.4 for female and 1.18 for male subjects.
   Results: The study included 259 Emiratis (age range 30-53 years, mean 41.76 years, 54.4% females), 24.5% are diabetic and 30.8% are hypertensive, with body mass index of 28.4 +/- 5.9 and 28.7 +/- 5.7 kg/m(2) in female and male subjects, respectively. Homozygous A of rs9939609 showed significantly higher fasting glucose compared to other genotypes (p = 0.04) with a trend of higher insulin level and HOMA-2IR. The A/A diabetic patients (n = 13) showed significantly higher insulin levels compared to other genotypes. G allele of rs9930506 showed a trend of higher fasting glucose and HOMA-2IR, but lower insulin level and HbAl c. No association of genotypes was detected with other components of metabolic syndrome.
   Conclusion: There is an association of FTO rs9939609 A/A genotype and impaired fasting glucose and insulin resistance. Homozygous A genotype diabetic patients may be more vulnerable to blood glucose fluctuation. Focused genotyping can help the health care providers to identify high risk groups of both normal population and diabetic patients to intervene accordingly.

AB The light harvesting photosystem in cyanobacteria offers a potential pathway for the regeneration of the nicotinamide cofactor NADPH, thereby facilitating the application of cyanobacteria as excellent whole cell biocatalysts in oxidoreductase-mediated biotransformation. The use of cyanobacterial metabolism for cofactor recycling improves the atom economy of the process compared to the commonly employed enzyme-coupled cofactor recycling using enzymes such as glucose dehydrogenase. Here we report the asymmetric conversion of acetophenone to chiral 1-phenylethanol by recombinant Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942 whole cell biocatalyst that expresses the NADPH dependent L. kefir alcohol dehydrogenase. Besides light, it was observed that carbon dioxide levels play a critical role in improving the bioconversion efficiency possibly due to the enhanced growth rate and improved cofactor availability at elevated CO2 levels. Complete reduction of acetophenone to optically pure ( R)-1-phenylethanol at 99% enantiomeric excess was achieved within 6 h with a relatively low cell density of 0.66 g/l by coupling optimum light and CO2 levels and without the need for a co-substrate.

AB The aims of this research were to obtain modified pectins of callus cultures using various culture conditions, to evaluate the relationship between the chemical characteristics of pectins, the swelling behavior and the release of prednisolone from calcium pectinate gel (CaPG) beads. An increase of the calcium concentration in the culture media correlated significantly with the rhamnogalacturonan I (RG-I) branching of the pectin. The beads from the pectin with a higher RG-I branching had the lower prednisolone release in a gastric fluid. The beads produced from the pectins obtained from callus cultured with a higher calcium concentration showed the lower prednisolone release. The swelling of the CaPG beads from pectin with a lower molecular weight (Mw) or linearity occurred to a lower degree. All beads prepared from modified pectins showed a high stability and a slow liberation of prednisolone in the simulated gastric and intestinal fluids, whereas rapid drug release in a colonic fluid. An applied strategy involving modification of the pectic structure using the abiotic factors allows obtaining the pectic gels with modified functional properties, in particular, with enhanced gastric and small intestinal resistance and a low drug release. These CaPG beads can be applied as the carriers for colon delivery of the drugs.

AB Plant factories have been developed to replace traditional agriculture, aiming to solve future problems of food availability. However, the nutrient solution in a plant factory is discharged after a single batch of plant cultivation, giving rise to large amounts of waste nutrient solution. Microalgae can be used to treat a wide variety of wastewater and effectively remove excessive nutrients from wastewater. Therefore, the incorporation of microalgal cultivation into a plant factory to treat waste nutrients would be a reasonable approach facilitating removal of waste nutrients with concomitant production of algal biomass. In this study, we isolated novel microalgal species suitable for the growth in waste nutrients from a plant factory and subsequently an underwater LED photobioreactor was constructed being incorporated into the plant factory system. Finally, treated waste nutrient solution was recycled back into the plant factory and successfully used for the cultivation of plant of butterhead lettuce (Lactuca sativa L.).

AB Pichia pastoris is subjected to strong oxidative stress in the methanol induction phase. The oxidative stress inflicts severe injury to yeast cells, which causes cell death and reduces protein expression ability. N-acetyltransferase in Saccharomyces cerevisiae can protect yeast cells from damage caused by decreasing reactive oxygen species (ROS) in oxidative pressure environments such as ethanol treatment, freeze-thawing, or heat shock. In this study, Nacetyltransferase from P. pastoris (PpMpr1) was overexpressed for the first time to improve the anti-oxidative stress ability to protect cells from strong ROS damage during the methanol induction phase. Cell viability of the PpMpr1 overexpression strain increased significantly, while biomass was increased by 22.7% at high dissolved oxygen (DO). At the same time, the heterologous alpha-glucosidase (AGL) expression level at 25% DO was increased by 21.5%. The AGL degradation was greatly relieved in the fermentation supernatant of the PpMpr1 overexpression strain. This study shows that PpMpr1 has a great potential for improvement of anti-oxidative stress ability in P. pastoris and provides a promising recombinant microorganism for industrial production of proteins.

AB This study presents the preparation and physical-chemical characterization of chemical resistant polyurethanebased compartments for biocatalytic application. The artificial compartments were prepared from an emulsion of polymer precursor and an aqueous phase that includes a biocatalytic reaction system. After curing, highly dispersed aqueous domains were obtained, which still contain the entire biocatalytic reaction system and remain fixed in the solid polymer preparation. The tensile and compression behavior of the prepared polymeric material is not significantly affected by the incorporation and facilitates excellent stability against various organic solvents and acid solutions. Thereby, the compartments can be used not only for enantioselective alcohol-dehydrogenase catalyzed reduction but also for a whole cell catalyzed hydrolysis of esters. Moreover, the compartmented whole-cell system was considerably stable to allow multiple reuses without a noticeable loss of catalytic activity of the incorporated whole cell catalytic reaction system.

AB Glutathione (GSH) is an important bioactive tripeptide and widely used in food, medicine and other industries. Recently, the bifunctional glutathione synthetase, GshF, has been applied for efficient GSH production under inducible promoter. In this study, the constitutive expression of GshF from Streptococcus sanguinis (GshFss) was investigated under four different constitutive promoters. Based on previous study, five genes in Escherichia coli JM109 were deleted to eliminate the degradation of precursors and GSH. The effects of gene knockout on the constitutive expression of GshFss and GSH production were evaluated by whole cell catalysis. Finally, the engineered strain JM03P(del)1 produced 24mM glutathione with addition of 30mM precursors in 5-L bioreactor fedbatch fermentation. The yield of GSH based on cysteine in JM03Pdel1was reached 80% without any inducer, which was improved by 17.3% than that in the control strain.

AB Lycopene has been broadly studied in recent decades due to its health benefits including cancer prevention, anti-atherogenic and anti-obesity effects, and modulation of the immune system. To obtain efficient synthesis of lycopene, extensive researches have been conducted in various microbial cells, including Yarrowia lipolytica, to heterologously produce lycopene using various genetic and metabolic engineering methods. In this study, the effects of copy numbers of lycopene synthesis genes, a variety of key central metabolic genes (especially AMP deaminase-encoding gene AMPD), and 5-L fermenter cultivation on lycopene production in Y. lipolytica were investigated and the engineered strains with significantly enhanced lycopene content (46-60 mg/g DCW) were achieved. It is therefore possible to make use of the obtained strains to meet the industrial demand of lycopene production on the basis of further genetic and process optimization.

AB In this study, the modified nanocomposite membrane of polyethersulfone (PES) with NH2-MIL-101(Cr) as a metal-organic framework (MOF) is exploited for Candida rugosa lipase (CRL) immobilization. To that end, the various amounts of NH2-MIL-101(Cr) nanoparticles are blended into PES casting solution to fabricate ultrafiltration membrane via phase inversion technique. The incorporation efficiency of NH2-MIL-101(Cr) nanoparticles on the membrane morphology is investigated using various techniques, namely atomic force microscopy (AFM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and contact angle goniometry. In terms of water pure flux and CRL immobilization efficiency, the best performance is observed for PES-NH2-MIL1% membrane. This bioactive membrane (CRL@GA@PES-NH2-MIL1%) displays an improvement in pH and thermal stability and separation performance that makes it a fruitful candidate for using in bioreactors. The examination of the wet-and drystorage stability of CRL@GA@PES-NH2-MIL1% demonstrates the high stability for the wet bioactive membrane. The reusability inspection of CRL@GA@PES-NH2-MIL1% represents about 50% conservation of the residual activity after 12 sequential usage cycles.

To avoid the usage of extra cofactors, the recombinant whole-cells containing AKRs and glucose dehydrogenase (GDH) were constructed and applied in the reduction reaction. The excellent conversion of 83.3% and enantiomeric excess (e.e.(p)) of 99.9% for (S)-NEMCA-HEPE was obtained when the recombinant whole cell (iolS-GDH) was selected as a catalyst. Additional introduction of 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate ([BMIm]BF4) in the whole cell-catalyzed reaction system, the reaction rates can be further enhanced, and the reaction conversion can be increased to 98.3% only in 1 h. The analysis of flow cytometry (FCM) and ultraviolet spectrum shows that [BMIm]BF4 can greatly enhance the whole cell-catalyzed reaction activities by affecting the permeability of cell membrane. This study provided a low-cost and efficient process for preparation of (S)-NEMCA-HEPE with high optical purity.

AB The glycosylation profile of therapeutic monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) is a crucial quality parameter for industrial Immunoglobulin G (IgG) production. Several alternative carbon sources, which function as glycosylation precursors, have been reported to impact the glycosylation pattern. Since the cells give priority to glucose uptake, the presence of this substrate can lower the effects of alternative sugars on the glycosylation. In order to get a better understanding of the influence of alternative sugars on the glycosylation and to investigate how they impact each other, combinations of mannose, fructose, galactose and fucose were fed to Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells in batch culture when the glucose became depleted and the lactate, accumulated in the culture, was used as carbon source. Feeding with a feed containing mannose or glucose decreased by 3-7% the percentage of high mannose glycans compared to a feed without mannose or glucose. Feeding with a feed containing galactose led to 8-20% increase of monogalactoglycans (G1) glycans and 2-6% rise of digalactoglycans (G2) glycans compared to feeding without galactose or glucose. The cells fed with fucose exhibited a significantly higher concentration of intracellular GDP-Fucose. This work indicates that a feeding strategy based on non-glucose sugars and potentially lactate, could be adopted to obtain a targeted glycosylation profile.

AB Survivin, a member of inhibitor of apoptosis family, is currently undergoing intensive investigations as a promising cancer marker due to its overexpression in multiple tumor tissues and close relationship with chemotherapy resistance. In this study, a novel 3D survivin promoter assay was developed, using enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) as the reporter to assess survivin promoter activity for cancer drug screening. Breast cancer MCF-7 cells were engineered to express EGFP controlled by a human survivin promoter and a CMV promoter, respectively. These cells were cultured in three-dimensional (3D) polymer-based scaffolds on a 40microbioreactor platform (40-MBR) with real-time monitoring of EGFP signals. The EGFP production driven by the survivin promoter was strongly correlated with survivin transcriptional level in MCF-7 cells treated with YM155, a small-molecule survivin promoter suppressant. Moreover, the potential inhibition effects of doxorubicin and cisplatin on survivin and their cytotoxicity were also evaluated in this system. This study demonstrated the potential application of the novel 3D survivin promoter-EGFP reporter assay for high-throughput screening of chemicals down-regulating survivin as a molecular target for cancer therapy.

ID IDENTIFICATION; SEPARATION; SELECTION
AB The phage display technique is a combinatorial technology in which random peptides are displayed on the surface of the phage; it is widely used to identify high-affinity peptides that bind to a target protein. However, this technique presents several problems due to non-specific binding of the phages and steric hindrance caused by blocking agents. To overcome these problems, we tested two modified methods and compared their screening performance with that of the conventional method. We used poly-His-tagged human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) as a target protein and silica-coated magnetic particles (MPs) with an immobilized nickelnitrilotriacetic acid ligand as a solid matrix. Modified method #1 (#M1) included two negative selection steps against a blocking agent (bovine serum albumin) and nude Ni-NTA MPs, after the positive selection step using immobilized HER2 on MPs in the absence of BSA. Modified method #2 (#M2) allowed the binding of phages and HER2 in solution prior to immobilizing HER2 on the MP surface. The negative selection procedure was the same between them. The binding affinity of the phages screened by #M1 and #M2 was evaluated by phage ELISA. Two phages from #M2 (#M2-4 and 5) showed the highest binding, and between them #M2-5 was selected for affinity maturation by inserting a hairpin-structured peptide between the two #M2-5 peptides. SPR study showed the HER2-binding affinity was indeed improved by ca. 2000-fold to become comparable with that of the intact antibody (trastuzumab). The modified biopanning methods combined with the dimerization maturation can be an effective way to develop antibody-mimicking peptides for affinity binding.

AB Due to the lack of powerful gene regulation elements, the engineering development of Streptomyces is often limited. Here, we disclosed that the heterologous sigma(70)-dependent promoters, which have been reported as inefficient tools for gene expression in Streptomyces, could be efficiently recognized by Streptomyces housekeeping factor shrdB. Therefore, an effective strategy was developed to engineer these promoters for robust gene expression in Streptomyces by fusing them with optimized 5'-untranslation regions (5'-UTRs). As a proof of concept, the widely used Ptac in E. coli was engineered by fusing its core promoter region with the 5'-UTRR15 from a relatively powerful Streptomyces promoter PkasO*(R15) and resulted in Ptac*, the activity of which was 8.1-fold that of Ptac and 1.7-fold that of PkasO*(R15) in S. lividans TK24. Next, the 5'-UTRR15 was optimized by randomizing the ribosome binding site (RBS). Based on the base biases of those RBSs with higher activity, eight artificial RBSs were rationally designed, and the optimal resulting promoter Ptac* RBS3 showed about 2.1, 3.6, and 17.6 times the activity of Ptac*, PkasO*(R15), and Ptac, respectively, demonstrating that the heterologous Ptac was converted into a type of robust Streptomyces promoters. This study thus greatly expands promoter diversity for the engineering of Streptomyces.

AB Cytokinins (CK) have been extensively studied for their roles in plant development. Recently, they also appeared to ensure crucial functions in the pathogenicity of some bacterial and fungal plant pathogens. Thus, identifying cytokinin-producing pathogens is a prerequisite to gain a better understanding of their role in pathogenicity. Taking advantage of the cytokinin perception properties of Malus domestica CHASE Histidine Kinase receptor 2 (MdCHK2), we thereby developed a selective and highly sensitive yeast biosensor for the application of cytokinin detection in bacterial samples. The biosensor is based on the mutated sln1. Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain expressing MdCHK2. The biosensor does not require any extraction or purification steps of biological samples, enabling cytokinin analysis directly from crude bacterial supernatants. For the first time, the production of cytokinin was shown in the well-known plant pathogenic bacteria Erwinia amylovora and was also revealed in human pathogens Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus agalactiae. Importantly, this biosensor was shown to be an efficient tool for unraveling certain steps in cytokinin biosynthesis by micro-organisms since this it was successfully used to unveil the role of ygdH22, a LOG-like gene, that is probably involved in cytokinin biosynthesis pathway in Escherichia coli. Overall, we demonstrated that our biosensor displays several advantages including time-and cost-effectiveness by allowing a rapid and specific detection of cytokinins in bacterial supernatants These results also support its scalability to high-throughput formats.

AB The red yeast Xanthophyllomyces dendrorhous was genetically engineered for high-yield accumulation of the carotenoid zeaxanthin. Initially, an astaxanthin hyper-producing mutant was used to generate a beta-carotene synthesizing transformant by inactivation of the astaxanthin synthase gene. Subsequently, a bacterial beta-carotene hydroxylase gene was genome integrated to establish beta-carotene to zeaxanthin conversion. Crucial for efficient zeaxanthin formation was the rate of this hydroxylation which was related to the number of integrated gene copies. Two strategies were followed to get multiple integrations, either random integration into the ribosomal DNA which resulted in a maximum copy number of 10, or directly integration of a total of 8 copies into both alleles of the astaxanthin synthase gene. Combining both procedures with additional insertion of the gene to enhance expression of the carotenogenesis limiting phytoene synthase, a transformant reaching a high level of zeaxanthin of 5.2 mg/g dw was finally generated. The application of pentose sugars including xylose as substrates for X. dendrorhous which avoids the inhibitory Crab-tree effect of glucose is favorable for carotenogenesis allowing the replacement of glucose by a hydrolysate of the waste product hemicellulose which is rich in xylose demonstrating ithe effectiveness as a sustainable and cost-efficient alternative for high-yield zeaxanthin formation.

AB Effective Protein A column regeneration is important in therapeutic monoclonal antibody (mAb) production for product quality and process economics. To design a robust and effective regeneration strategy, resin compatibility, microbial inactivation efficiency and cleaning effectiveness are three major considerations. Regenerating Protein A column using acidic (e.g. acetic acid) and/or caustic (e.g. NaOH) solutions is a common approach. However, it is challenging to balance between resin performance decline and adequate microbial control in choosing the right caustic solution concentration, even for resin with enhanced caustic tolerance such as MabSelect SuRe.
   This report introduces an enhanced regeneration strategy for MabSelect SuRe resin. The approach applies benzyl alcohol in low concentration acetic acid and NaOH (100 mM) solutions in sequential steps to regenerate MabSelect SuRe resin for reuse. Such solutions demonstrated good resin compatibility in resin functional test after extended solution incubation time, and demonstrated superior microbial control using eight test microorganisms. The cleaning effectiveness of the proposed strategy is demonstrated by carryover study, where product and impurity carryover was below detection limit. Finally, during a resin lifetime study, consistent step yields and product quality attributes were demonstrated, and no carryover was observed, up to 150 purification cycles. A viral clearance study further demonstrated that aged resin at the end of the resin lifetime had comparable viral clearance performance compared to new resin. No active virus was detected in the elution pool of the subsequent blank runs. These studies further verified the robustness of the proposed regeneration strategy for MabSelect SuRe resin.

AB Different immobilized biocatalysts of Thermomyces lanuginosus lipase (TLL) exhibited different properties for the ethanolysis of high oleic sunflower oil in solvent-free systems. TLL immobilized by interfacial adsorption on octadecyl (C-18) supports lost its 1,3-regioselectivity and produced more than 99% of ethyl esters. This reaction was influenced by mass-transfer limitations. TLL adsorbed on macroporous C-18 supports (616 A of pore diameter) was 10-fold more active than TLL adsorbed on mesoporous supports (100-200 A of pore diameter) in solvent-free systems. Both derivatives exhibited similar activity when working in hexane in the absence of diffusional limitations. In addition, TLL adsorbed on macroporous Purolite C-18 was 5-fold more stable than TLL adsorbed on mesoporous Sepabeads C-18. The stability of the best biocatalyst was 20-fold lower in anhydrous oil than in anhydrous hexane. Mild PEGylation of immobilized TLL greatly increased its stability in anhydrous hexane at 40 degrees C, fully preserving the activity after 20 days. In anhydrous oil at 40 degrees C, PEGylated TLL-Purolite C18 retained 65% of its initial activity after six days compared to 10% of the activity retained by the unmodified biocatalyst. Macroporous and highly hydrophobic supports (e. g., Purolite C-18) seem to be very useful to prepare optimal immobilized biocatalysts for ethanolysis of oils by TLL in solvent-free systems.

AB Lactobacillus reuteri metabolizes glycerol through propanediol-utilization (Pdu) pathway to 1,3-propanediol (1,3PD) via 3-hydroxypropionaldehyde (3-HPA) as intermediate. In the resting cells, the oxidized co-factor obtained in the reaction is regenerated by simultaneous oxidation of 3-HPA to 3-hydroxypropionic acid (3-HP) using propionaldehyde dehydrogenase (PduP), phosphotransacylase (PduL) and propionate kinase (PduW). We have earlier shown that the use of resting cells of recombinant Escherichia coli expressing the oxidative pathway gives the highest theoretical yield of 1 mol 3-HP per mol 3-HPA but is limited by cofactor depletion. In the present study, the gene encoding the enzyme NAD(P) H oxidase (LreuNox) that utilizes molecular oxygen as substrate, was isolated from L. reuteri and heterologously overexpressed in E. coli. LreuNox has a pH optimum of 6 and exhibits V-max of 101.1 +/- 2.2 U/ mg with NADH, which is 30% higher than that for NADPH. Co-expression of LreuNox with PduP, PduL and PduW in E. coli enhances the biocatalytic lifetime as well as productivity at least two-fold compared to that achieved without co-factor regeneration.

AB During the last decade, oncolytic viruses such as vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) have gained tremendous popularity as efficient vaccines for infectious diseases as well as for the treatment of cancer. Our laboratory has developed two stable cell lines, 293SF-3F6 (derived from HEK293A cells) and SF-BMAdR cells (a variant of A549 that expresses the E1 region of human adenovirus). These two cell lines were adapted to grow efficiently in suspension culture and in serum-free medium. In this report we evaluated the production of a recombinant VSV expressing the green fluorescent protein (VSV-GFP) in these two stable cell lines. At a relatively low cell density of 500,000 cells per ml, 293SF-3F6 produced 4.6 times more infectious particles than SF-BMAdR cells. There was a positive correlation between volumetric virus titer and cell density up to 2. E+ 07 cells/ml. A fed-batch process using an in-house medium and feed was developed to support the growth of 293SF-3F6 cells up to a concentration of 1. E+ 07 cells/ml for infection at higher cell density and VSV production at high titer. Shifting the temperature from 37 degrees C to 34 degrees C at infection time improved VSV titer up to 3.3 fold. After scaling up the optimal condition from small scale (3 ml) to larger volumes (50 & 200 ml), the maximal volumetric titer obtained using the 293SF-3F6 cells was in average 2.9E+ 10 extracellular infectious particles/ml. In conclusion, our data demonstrated that 293SF-3F6 cells, for which a cGMP master cell bank is available, is a performant cell line to scale up VSV production in suspension culture using serum-free medium.

AB Psoriasis is a chronic immune-mediated disease with a complex etiology involving various genetic and immunological factors as well as environmental factors. Psoriasis is thought to be mediated by T-cells polarized to a Th17 fate. PTPN2 encodes the T-cell protein tyrosine phosphatase, which acts as a negative regulator of the JAK/STAT signaling pathways downstream of cytokines and plays a prominent role in T-cell activation, signaling and/or effector function. To evaluate the association between PTPN2 gene polymorphisms and psoriasis in the Northeastern Chinese population. A case-control study was conducted, and 398 patients with psoriasis and 397 healthy controls were genotyped for thirteen genetic polymorphisms in PTPN2. Allele analysis revealed that rs2847297, rs657555 and rs482160 polymorphisms were significantly associated with psoriasis (p = 0.0018, p = 0.0017 and p = 0.0086, respectively). Genotype analysis also revealed that these polymorphisms were significantly associated with psoriasis under different models (codominant, dominant and recessive models) (p < 0.05). In this study, three haplotypes (H1, H7 and H11) were also found to be associated with psoriasis (p = 0.0015, p = 0.0094, and p = 0.0124, respectively). These results indicate that PTPN2 genetic poly-morphisms are associated with psoriasis in the Northeastern Chinese population.

This position paper replaces the 2008 WHO position paper on typhoid vaccines (WHO, 2008) [2]. It re-emphasizes the importance of vaccination to control typhoid fever and presents the WHO recommendations on the use of a new generation of typhoid conjugate vaccines.
   Footnotes to this paper provide a number of core references including references to grading tables that assess the quality of the scientific evidence, and to the evidence-to-recommendation tables. In accordance with its mandate to provide guidance to Member States on health policy matters, WHO issues a series of regularly updated position papers on vaccines and combinations of vaccines against diseases that have an international public health impact. These papers are concerned primarily with the use of vaccines in large-scale immunization programmes; they summarize essential background information on diseases and vaccines, and conclude with WHO's current position on the use of vaccines in the global context. Recommendations on the use of cholera vaccines were discussed by the Strategic Advisory Group of Experts (SAGE) in October 2017; evidence presented at these meetings can be accessed at: http://www.who.int/immunization/sage/meetings/2017/October/presentations_background_docs/en/.

AB In 2017, the World Health Organization (WHO) published an updated document aimed at facilitating the understanding of the immunological basis of pertussis vaccines and their use. The document "The Immunological Basis for Immunization Series: Pertussis Vaccines" is freely available on the WHO website. The main purpose of the module is to provide national immunization managers and vaccination professionals with an overview of the scientific basis of vaccination against pertussis and the immunological basis for the WHO position on pertussis vaccines.
   The Immunological Basis for Immunization Series was initially developed in 1993. Since then the series was regularly updated and extended. They reflect the biological differences in immune responses to the individual pathogens and the differing strategies employed to create the best possible level of protection that can be provided by vaccination.
   We invite the immunization community to use these references, and we hope the updated pertussis vaccine module will be a valuable resource. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB This article presents the World Health Organization's (WHO) recommendations on the use of hepatitis B vaccines excerpted from the Hepatitis B vaccines: WHO position paper, July 2017, published in the Weekly Epidemiological Record (Hepatitis B vaccines, 2017) [1]. This position paper replaces the May 2009 WHO position paper on hepatitis B vaccines (Hepatitis B vaccines, 2009) [2].
   The position paper gives updated information on hepatitis B vaccines and their storage, transport and deployment. The recommendations concern the target groups for vaccination and the appropriate schedules. In particular, the recommendations stress the importance of vaccination of all infants at birth as the most effective intervention for the prevention of hepatitis B virus-associated disease worldwide.
   Footnotes to this paper provide a number of core references including references to grading tables that assess the quality of the scientific evidence, and to the evidence-to-recommendation table. In accordance with its mandate to provide guidance to Member States on health policy matters, WHO issues a series of regularly updated position papers on vaccines and combinations of vaccines against diseases that have an international public health impact.

AB Background: Coverage levels for many recommended adult vaccinations are low. The cost-effectiveness research literature on adult vaccinations has not been synthesized in recent years, which may contribute to low awareness of the value of adult vaccinations and to their under-utilization. We assessed research literature since 1980 to summarize economic evidence for adult vaccinations included on the adult immunization schedule.
   Methods: We searched PubMed, EMBASE, EconLit, and Cochrane Library from 1980 to 2016 and identified economic evaluation or cost-effectiveness analysis for vaccinations targeting persons aged >= 18 years in the U.S. or Canada. After excluding records based on title and abstract reviews, the remaining publications had a full-text review from two independent reviewers, who extracted economic values that compared vaccination to "no vaccination" scenarios.
   Results: The systematic searches yielded 1688 publications. After removing duplicates, off-topic publications, and publications without a "no vaccination" comparison, 78 publications were included in the final analysis (influenza = 25, pneumococcal = 18, human papillomavirus = 9, herpes zoster = 7, tetanus-diphtheria-pertussis = 9, hepatitis B = 9, and multiple vaccines = 1). Among outcomes assessing age based vaccinations, the percent indicating cost-savings was 56% for influenza, 31% for pneumococcal, and 23% for tetanus-diphtheria-pertussis vaccinations. Among age-based vaccination outcomes reporting $/QALY, the percent of outcomes indicating a cost per QALY of <=$100,000 was 100% for influenza, 100% for pneumococcal, 69% for human papillomavirus, 71% for herpes zoster, and 50% for tetanus-diphtheria-pertussis vaccinations.
   Conclusions: The majority of published studies report favorable cost-effectiveness profiles for adult vaccinations, which supports efforts to improve the implementation of adult vaccination recommendations. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

   STRATEGIES; DECISION; CHILDREN; QUALITY; REFUSAL; IMPACT
AB Background: Herd immunity, or community immunity, occurs when susceptible people in a population are indirectly protected from infection thanks to the pervasiveness of immunity within the population. In this study, we aimed to systematically review interventions designed to communicate what community immunity is and how community immunity works to members of the general public.
   Methods: We searched PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and Web of Science for peer-reviewed articles describing interventions with or without evaluations. We then conducted web searches with Google to identify interventions lacking associated publications. We extracted data about the target population of the interventions, the interventions themselves (e.g., did they describe what community immunity is, and how it works), any effects of evaluated interventions, and synthesized data narratively.
   Results: We identified 32 interventions: 11 interventions described in peer-reviewed articles and 21 interventions without associated articles. Of the 32 interventions, 5 described what community immunity is, 6 described the mechanisms of how community immunity occurs and 21 described both. Fourteen of the 32 addressed infectious diseases in general while the other 13 addressed one or more specific diseases. Twelve of the 32 interventions used videos, 7 used interactive simulations and 6 used questionnaires. Ten of the 11 peer-reviewed articles described studies evaluating at least one effect of the interventions. Within these 10, 4/4 reported increased knowledge, 3/5 reported shifts of attitudes in favour of vaccination, 2/5 reported increased intentions to vaccinate. Of 3 studies evaluating interventions specifically about community immunity, 2 reported increased intentions to vaccinate.
   Conclusions: A compelling benefit of vaccination exists at the population level in the form of community immunity. Identifying ways to optimally communicate about this benefit may be important, because some evidence suggests that effective communication about community immunity can increase vaccination intentions.

AB The efforts for the development and testing of vaccines against Trypanosoma cruzi infection have increased during the past years. We have designed a TcVac series of vaccines composed of T. cruzi derived, GPI-anchored membrane antigens. The TcVac vaccines have been shown to elicit humoral and cellular mediated immune responses and provide significant (but not complete) control of experimental infection in mice and dogs. Herein, we aimed to test two immunization protocols for the delivery of DNA-prime/DNA-boost vaccine (TcVac1) composed of TcG2 and TcG4 antigens in a BALB/c mouse model. Mice were immunized with TcVac1 through intradermal/electroporation (IDE) or intramuscular (IM) routes, challenged with T. cruzi, and evaluated during acute phase of infection. The humoral immune response was evaluated through the assessment of anti-TcG2 and anti-TcG4 IgG subtypes by using an ELISA. Cellular immune response was assessed through a lymphocyte proliferation assay. Finally, clinical and morphopathological aspects were evaluated for all experimental animals. Our results demonstrated that when comparing TcVac1 IDE delivery vs IM delivery, the former induced significantly higher level of antigen-specific antibody response (lgG2a + IgG2b > IgG1) and lymphocyte proliferation, which expanded in response to challenge infection. Histological evaluation after challenge infection showed infiltration of inflammatory cells (macrophages and lymphocytes) in the heart and skeletal tissue of all infected mice. However, the largest increase in inflammatory infiltrate was observed in TcVac1_IDE/Tc mice when compared with TcVac1_IM/Tc or non-vaccinated/infected mice. The extent of tissue inflammatory infiltrate was directly associated with the control of tissue amastigote nests in vaccinated/infected (vs. non-vaccinated/infected) mice. Our results suggest that IDE delivery improves the protective efficacy of TcVac1 vaccine against T. cruzi infection in mice when compared with IM delivery of the vaccine. (C) 2018 The Authors.

TI Licensing the first reduced, mu g dose whole virion, aluminum adjuvanted
   seasonal influenza vaccine - A randomized-controlled multicenter trial

LA English
DT Article
DE Influenza; Vaccine; Trial; Dose
ID ELDERLY-PATIENTS; SAFETY; VIRUS; ADULT
AB Introduction: Shortages of vaccine supplies repeatedly occur, limiting our abilities to prevent influenza. Therefore, increasing production volume remains a priority. The presently licensed seasonal influenza vaccines contain 15 fig of viral hemagglutinin per strain in adult, and up to 60 mu g in elderly patients. Decreasing the amount of viral parts while maintaining efficacy is one way of increasing production capacity.
   Methods: This was multicenter, stratified (18-60 years and >60 years of age), prospective, randomized, double-blind, active-controlled, parallel-arm, non-inferiority clinical trial, conducted in the European Union, involving 1206 patients. We used hemagglutination inhibition assay to assess the immunogenicity of a newly developed, whole virion, seasonal trivalent influenza vaccine, containing 6 mu g hemagglutinin per strain (FluArt, Hungary) and to assess whether it is non-inferior to the presently licensed vaccine containing 15 mu g hemagglutinin per strain. Safety and tolerability of both vaccines were assessed based on EMEA guidelines.
   Results: The reduced dose vaccine containing 6 mu g of hemagglutinin per strain was safe and non-inferior to the currently licensed 15 mu g vaccine, not only in adult, but also in elderly patients, according to the immunogenicity criteria by the FDA and EMEA (seroconversion, seroprotection and post/pre vaccination GMT ratios), and it fulfilled all applicable licensing requirements for both age groups.
   Conclusions: Based on the results, the reduced dose vaccine was licensed in the EU member state Hungary and safely administered in over 1.5 million cases so far. The amount of viral hemagglutinin needed can be reduced by using a whole virion vaccine with aluminum phosphate adjuvants.

ID HUMAN-PAPILLOMAVIRUS; DANISH; RISK
AB Background: Few studies have studied the association between unintended human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination and adverse pregnancy outcomes. This study set out to determine the association between HPV vaccination during pregnancy and subsequent risk of spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, and one-year infant mortality.
   Methods: Population-based study including all pregnancies in Denmark (October 2006-December 2014) among women born 1975-1992. From nationwide health registries using the personal identification numbers, we obtained information on HPV vaccination, pregnancy outcomes, and infant mortality. The exposure window went from four weeks before conception date until 22 weeks of gestation for the outcome spontaneous abortion, and until birth for stillbirth and infant mortality outcomes. In the analyses of spontaneous abortion, we used time to event models, for stillbirth logistic regression models, and for infant mortality Cox regression was applied.
   Results: We included 522,705 pregnancies for the outcome spontaneous abortion (7487 exposed to at least one dose during pregnancy); 351,878 births (5262 exposed to at least one dose during pregnancy) for the stillbirth; and 350,739 live births (5245 exposed to at least one dose during pregnancy) for infant mortality. No significantly increased rate of spontaneous abortion among women vaccinated during pregnancy compared with unvaccinated women was found. In addition, we found no association between HPV vaccination during pregnancy and stillbirth (adjusted odds ratio = 0.96 [95% CI: 0.57-1.611), or infant mortality (adjusted hazard ratio = 0.94 [95% CI: 0.53-1.67]). A secondary analysis showed no association between number of doses and timing of administration (i.e. vaccination before or during pregnancy) and an increased risk of spontaneous abortion.
   Conclusion: We found no increased risk of spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, or infant mortality following unintended HPV vaccination during pregnancy. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI The uptake of adolescent vaccinations through the School Immunisation
   Program in specialist schools in Victoria, Australia

AB Background: As part of the National Immunisation Program (NIP) students in Australia receive adolescent immunisations through the School Immunisation Program at 12 to 13 years. For children with disabilities attending specialist schools, no vaccine uptake data is collected at this time point. We aimed to determine uptake of diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis (dTpa) and Human Papillomavirus (HPV) immunisations amongst young people with disabilities in specialist schools in Victoria.
   Methods: A prospective cohort study was conducted in Victoria, Australia. Data was collected on immunisation days in the 2017 school year from specialist schools in Victoria. The school immunisation coordinator entered data online for eligible students for receipt of dTpa and HPV on each school immunisation day. Demographic data, motor and intellectual function of students and reasons for non-receipt of dTpa and HPV vaccine were recorded. Data were analysed using descriptive statistics.
   Results: Of 73 eligible specialist schools in Victoria, 28 (38%) participated. dTpa was received by 63% (237/374) of participating students and HPV dose 1 (HPV1) was received by 66% (76/114) females and 67% (174/260) male students respectively. Three doses of HPV were received by only 41% (100/241) of students. The main reasons for missed immunisation were absence from school, lack of consent and inability to immunise due to the student's behaviour and/or anxiety.
   Conclusion: This is the first study in Australia to report that uptake of adolescent immunisations in specialist schools for young people with a disability is significantly lower than in mainstream settings. Comparative data during the same time period for students in mainstream schools demonstrated higher uptake, at 89% for dTpa and 75% for three doses of HPV. These data highlight the inequity of receipt of school-based immunisations for this group of adolescents, the barriers to which could be more thoroughly explored through qualitative inquiry from a socio-ecological perspective.

AB Objective: To determine whether differences in combination DTaP vaccine types at 2, 4 and 6 months of age were associated with mortality (all-cause or non-specific), within 30 days of vaccination.
   Design: Observational nationwide cohort study.
   Setting: Linked population data from the Australian Childhood Immunisation Register and National Death Index.
   Participants: Australian infants administered a combination trivalent, quadrivalent or hexavalent DTaP vaccine (DTaP types) between January 1999 and December 2010 at 2, 4 and 6 months as part of the primary vaccination series. The study population included 2.9, 2.6, & 2.3 million children in the 2, 4 and 6 month vaccine cohorts, respectively.
   Main outcome measures: Infants were evaluated for the primary outcome of all-cause mortality within 30 days. A secondary outcome was non-specific mortality (unknown cause of death) within 30 days of vaccination. Non-specific mortality was defined as underlying or other cause of death codes, R95 'Sudden infant death syndrome', R96 'Other sudden death, cause unknown', R98 'Unattended death', R99 'Other ill-defined and unspecified cause of mortality' or where no cause of death was recorded.
   Results: The rate of 30 day all-cause mortality was low and declined from 127.4 to 59.3 deaths per 100,000 person-years between 2 and 6 month cohorts. When compared with trivalent DTaP vaccines, no elevated risk in all-cause or non-specific mortality was seen with any quadrivalent or hexavalent DTaP vaccines, for any cohort.
   Conclusion: Use of routine DTaP combination vaccines with differing disease antigens administered during the first six months of life is not associated with infant mortality. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Introduction/Hypothesis: Recruitment of participants into phase 1 vaccine clinical trials can be challenging since these vaccines have not been used in humans and there is no perceived benefit to the participant. Occasionally, as was the case with a phase 1 clinical trial of an Ebola vaccine in Halifax, Canada, during the 2014-2016 West African Ebola virus outbreak, recruitment is less difficult. In this study, we explored the motivations of participants in two phase 1 vaccine trials that were concurrently enrolling at the same centre and compared the motivations of participants in a high-profile phase 1 Ebola vaccine trial to those in a less high-profile phase 1 adjuvanted seasonal influenza vaccine study.
   Methods: An online survey which included participants' prior experience with clinical trials, motivations to participate (including financial incentives), and demographic information was developed to examine the motivations of healthy participants in two phase 1 clinical vaccine trials conducted at the Canadian Center for Vaccinology in Halifax, Nova Scotia. Participants were invited via email to complete the online survey. Readability and clarity were assessed through pilot testing.
   Results: A total of 49 (55.7%) of 88 participants of the two studies completed the survey (22 [55%] of 40 participants from the Ebola vaccine study and 27 [56.3%] of 48 from the adjuvanted influenza vaccine study). Motivations that were most frequently ranked among participants' top three in both trials were (1) wanting to contribute to the health of others, (2) wanting to participate in something important, (3) wanting to contribute to the advancement of science, and (4) wanting to receive an incentive such as money or a tablet.
   Conclusions/Recommendations: Although media attention and financial compensation were more often cited by Ebola vaccine trial participants as a reason to participate, both altruistic and self-interested factors were important motivations for participants in their decision to participate in a phase 1 vaccine clinical trial.

AB Pneumococcal carriage is a prerequisite for disease, and underpins herd protection provided by pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCVs). There are few data on the impact of PCVs in lower income settings, particularly in Asia. In 2013, the Lao People's Democratic Republic (Lao PDR) introduced 13-valent PCV (PCV13) as a 3 + 0 schedule (doses at 6, 10 and 14 weeks of age) with limited catch-up vaccination. We conducted two cross-sectional carriage surveys (pre- and two years post-PCV) to assess the impact of PCV13 on nasopharyngeal pneumococcal carriage in 5-8 week old infants (n = 1000) and 12-23 month old children (n = 1010). Pneumococci were detected by quantitative real-time PCR, and molecular serotyping was performed using DNA microarray. Post PCV13, there was a 23% relative reduction in PCV13-type carriage in children aged 12-23 months (adjusted prevalence ratio [aPR] 0.77 [0.61-0.96]), and no significant change in non-PCV13 serotype carriage (aPR 1.11 [0.89-1.38]). In infants too young to be vaccinated, there was no significant change in carriage of PCV13 serotypes (aPR 0.74 [0.43-1.27]) or non-PCV13 serotypes (aPR 1.29 [0.85-1.96]), although trends were suggestive of indirect effects. Over 70% of pneumococcal-positive samples contained at least one antimicrobial resistance gene, which were more common in PCV13 serotypes (p < 0.001). In 12-23 month old children, pneumococcal density of both PCV13 serotypes and non-PCV13 serotypes was higher in PCV13-vaccinated compared with undervaccinated children (p = 0.004 and p < 0.001, respectively). This study provides evidence of PCV13 impact on carriage in a population without prior PCV7 utilisation, and provides important data from a lower-middle income setting in Asia. The reductions in PCV13 serotype carriage in vaccine eligible children are likely to result in reductions in pneumococcal transmission and disease in Lao PDR. (C) 2018 The Authors.

AB Plasmodium vivax Merozoite Surface Protein-9 (PvMSP-9) is a malaria vaccine candidate naturally immunogenic in humans and able to induce high antibody titers in animals when delivered as a recombinant protein. Recently, we identified the sequence EAAPENAEPVHENA (PvMSP9(E795-A808)) as the main linear B-cell epitope in naturally exposed individuals. However, the potential of PvMSP9(E795-A808) as an immunogen in experimental animal models remained unexplored. Here we assess the immunogenicity of PvMSP9(E795-A808) using synthetic peptides. The peptides tested in BALB/c mice include two repeats of the sequence EAAPENAEPVHENA tested alone (peptide RII), or linked to an autologous (PvMSP9 peptide pL; pLRII) or heterologous (p2 tetanus toxin universal T cell epitope; TTRII) T cell epitope. Immune responses were evaluated by ELISA, FLUOROSPOT, and indirect immunofluorescence. We show that all of the peptide constructs tested were immunogenic eliciting specific IgG antibodies at different levels, with a prevalence of IgG1 and IgG2. Animals immunized with synthetic peptides containing T cell epitopes (pLRII or TIMID had more efficient antibody responses that resulted in higher antibody titers able to recognize the native protein by immunofluorescence. Relevantly, the frequency of IFN-gamma secreting SFC elicited by immunization with TTRII synthetic peptide was comparable to that reported to the PvMSP9-Nt recombinant protein. Taken together, our study indicates that PvMSP9(E795-A808) is highly immunogenic in mice and further studies to evaluate its value as promising vaccine target are warranted. Moreover, our study supports the critical role of CD4 T cell epitopes to enhance humoral responses induced by subunit based vaccines. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Emergence and dissemination of multidrug resistance among pathogenic Escherichia coli have posed a serious threat to public health across developing and developed countries. In combination with a flexible repertoire of virulence mechanisms, E. coli can cause a vast range of intestinal (InPEC) and extraintestinal (ExPEC) diseases but only a very limited number of antibiotics still remains effective against this pathogen. Hence, a broad spectrum E. coli vaccine could be a promising alternative to prevent the burden of such diseases, while offering the potential for covering against several InPEC and ExPEC at once. SslE, the Secreted and Surface-associated Lipoprotein of E. coli, is a widely distributed protein among InPEC and ExPEC. SslE functions ex vivo as a mucinase capable of degrading mucins and reaching the surface of mucus-producing epithelial cells. SslE was identified by reverse vaccinology as a protective vaccine candidate against an ExPEC murine model of sepsis, and further shown to be cross-effective against other ExPEC and InPEC models of infection. In this study, we aimed to gain insight into the immune response to antigen SslE and identify an immunization strategy suited to generate robust mucosal and systemic immune responses. We'showed, by analyzing T cell and antibody responses, that mice immunized with SsIE via an intranasal prime followed by two intramuscular boosts developed an enhanced overall immune response compared to either intranasal-only or intramuscular-only protocols. Importantly, we also report that this regimen of immunization did not impact the richness of the murine gut microbiota, and mice had a comparable cecal microbial composition, whether immunized with SslE or PBS. Collectively, our findings further support the use of SslE in future vaccination strategies to effectively target both InPEC and ExPEC while not perturbing the resident gut microbiota.

AB Objective: To develop a Vaccine Confidence Index (VCI) that is capable of detecting variations in parental confidence towards childhood immunizations centered on trust and concern issues that impact vaccine confidence.
   Methods: We used a web-based national poll of 893 parents of children <7 years in 2016 to assess the measures created for the Emory VCI (EVCI). EVCI measures were developed using constructs related to vaccine confidence identified by the U.S. National Vaccine Advisory Committee (i.e., "Information Environment", "Trust", "Healthcare Provider", "Attitudes and Beliefs", and "Social Norms"). Reliability for EVCI was assessed using Cronbach's alpha. Using the variables related to each of the constructs, we calculated an overall EVCI score that was then assessed against self-reported childhood vaccine receipt using chi-square and the Cochrane-Armitage trend tests.
   Results: Respondents' EVCI scores could range from 0 to 24, and the full range of values was observed in this sample (Mean = 17.5 (SD 4.8)). EVCI scores were significantly different (p <= 0.006 for all comparisons) between parents who indicated their child(ren) received routinely recommended vaccines compared with parents who indicated they had delayed or declined recommended immunizations. There was also a significant, consistent association between higher EVCI scores and greater reported vaccine receipt.
   Conclusions: We developed EVCI to reliably measure parental vaccine confidence, with individuals' scores linked to parental vaccine-related attitudes, intentions, and behaviors. As such, EVCI may be a useful tool for future monitoring of both population and individual confidence in childhood immunization. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB A human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) vaccine to prevent infection and/or reduce disease associated with congenital infection or visceral disease in transplant recipients is a high priority, but has remained elusive. We created a disabled infectious single cycle rhesus CMV (RhCMV) deleted for glycoprotein L (gL) and the MHC class I immune evasion genes Rh178 and Rh182-189, and restored its epithelial cell tropism by inserting the Rh128-131A genes. The resulting virus, RhCMVR Delta gL/178/182-189, was used to vaccinate rhesus monkeys intramuscularly and was compared with vaccination of animals with soluble RhCMV glycoprotein B (gB) in alum/monophosphoryl lipid A or with PBS as a control. At 4 weeks after the second vaccination, an increased frequency of RhCMV-specific CD8 T cells was detected in animals vaccinated with the RhCMVR Delta gL/178/182-189 vaccine compared to animals vaccinated with soluble gB. In contrast, monkeys vaccinated with soluble gB had 20-fold higher gB antibody titers than animals vaccinated with RhCMVR Delta gL/178/182-189. Titers of neutralizing antibody to RhCMV infection of fibroblasts were higher in animals vaccinated with gB compared with RhCMVR Delta gL/178/182-189. Following vaccination, monkeys were challenged subcutaneously with RhCMV UCD59, a low passage virus propagated in monkey kidney epithelial cells. All animals became infected after challenge; however, the frequency of RhCMV detection in the blood was reduced in monkeys vaccinated with soluble gB compared with those vaccinated with RhCMVR Delta gL/178/182-189. The frequency of challenge virus shedding in the urine and saliva and the RhCMV copy number shed at these sites was not different in animals vaccinated with RhCMVR Delta gL/178/182-189 or soluble gB compared with those that received PBS before challenge. Although the RhCMVR Delta gL/178/182-189 vaccine was superior in inducing cellular immunity to RhCMV, it induced lower titers of neutralizing antibody and antibody to gB than the soluble gB vaccine; after challenge, animals vaccinated with soluble gB had a lower frequency of virus detection in the blood than those vaccinated with RhCMVR Delta gL/178/182-189.

AB Background: In the Southern Hemisphere 2010 influenza season, Segirus' split-virion, trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine was associated with increased reports of fevers and febrile reactions in young children. A staged clinical development program of a quadrivalent vaccine (Seqirus IIV4 [S-IIV4]; Afluria (R) Quadrivalent/Afluria Quad (TM)/Afluria Tetrar (TM)), wherein each vaccine strain is split using a higher detergent concentration to reduce lipid content (considered the cause of the increased fevers and febrile reactions), is now complete.
   Methods: Children aged 6-59 months were randomized 3:1 and stratified by age (6-35 months/36-59 months) to receive S-IIV4 (n = 1684) or a United States (US)-licensed comparator IIV4 (C-IIV4; Fluzone Quadrivalent; n = 563) during the Northern Hemisphere 2016-2017 influenza season. The primary objective was to demonstrate noninferior immunogenicity of S-IIV4 versus C-IIV4.Immunogenicity was assessed by hemagglutination inhibition (baseline, 28 days postvaccination). Solicited, unsolicited, and serious adverse events were assessed for 7, 28, and 180 days postvaccination, respectively.
   Results: S-IIV4 met the immunogenicity criteria for noninferiority. Adjusted geometric mean titer ratios (C-IIV4/S-IIV4) for the A/H1N1, A/H3N2, B/Yamagata, and B/Victoria strains were 0.79 (95% CI: 0.72, 0.88), 1.27 (1.15, 1.42), 1.12 (1.01,1.24), and 0.97 (0.86,1.09), respectively. Corresponding values for differences in seroconversion rates (C-IIV4 minus S-IIV4) were -10.3 (-15.4, -5.1), 2.6 (-2.5, 7.8), 3.1 (-2.1, 8.2), and 0.9 (-4.2, 6.1). Solicited, unsolicited, and serious adverse events were similar between vaccines in both age cohorts, apart from fever. Fever rates were lower with S-IIV4 (5.8%) than C-IIV4 (8.4%), with no febrile convulsions reported with either vaccine during the 7 days postvaccination.
   Conclusion: S-IIV4, manufactured with a higher detergent concentration, demonstrated noninferior immunogenicity to the US -licensed C-IIV4, with similar postvaccination safety and tolerability, in children aged 6-59 months. This completes the program demonstrating the immunogenicity and safety of S-IIV4 in participants aged 6 months and older. (C) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Background: Immunization programs have leveraged decades of research to maximize oral polio vaccine (OPV) response. Moving toward global poliovirus eradication, the WHO recommended phased OPV-to-IPV replacement on schedules in 2012. Using the MAL-ED prospective birth cohort data, we evaluated the influence of early life exposures impacting OPV immunization by measuring OPV response for serotypes 1 and 3.
   Methods: Polio neutralizing antibody assays were conducted at 7 and 15 months of age for serotypes 1 and 3. Analyses were conducted on children receiving >= 3 OPV doses (n = 1449). History of vaccination, feeding patterns, physical growth, home environment, diarrhea, enteropathogen detection, and gut inflammation were examined as risk factors for non-response [Log(2)(titer)< 3] and Log(2)(titer) by serotype using multivariate regression.
   Findings: Serotype 1 seroconversion was significantly higher than serotype 3 (96.6% vs. 89.6%, 15 months). Model results indicate serotypes 1 and 3 failure was minimized following four and six OPV doses, respectively; however, enteropathogen detection and poor socioeconomic conditions attenuated response in both serotypes. At three months of age, bacterial detection in stool reduced serotype 1 and 3 Log(2) titers by 0.34 (95% CI 0.14-0.54) and 0.53 (95% CI 0.29-0.77), respectively, and increased odds of serotype 3 failure by 3.0 (95% CI 1.6-5.8). Our socioeconomic index, consisting of Water, Assets, Maternal education, and Income (WAMI), was associated with a 0.79 (95% CI 0.15-1.43) and 1.23 (95% CI 034-2.12) higher serotype 1 and 3 Log(2) titer, respectively, and a 0.04 (95% CI 0.002-0.40) lower odds of serotype 3 failure. Introduction of solids, transferrin receptor, and underweight were differentially associated with serotype response. Other factors, including diarrheal frequency and breastfeeding practices, were not associated with OPV response.
   Interpretation: Under real-world conditions, improved vaccination coverage and socio-environmental conditions, and reducing early life bacterial exposures are key to improving OPV response and should inform polio eradication strategies. (C) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Vaccine adverse events and controversial safety issues have occurred in recent decades in Japan: aseptic meningitis following the measles-mumps-rubella combined vaccine (MMR), anaphylaxis after immunization with live virus vaccines and inactivated split influenza vaccine, an increased incidence of febrile illness following the simultaneous administration of inactivated vaccines, and chronic pain with neurological illness after immunization with the human papilloma virus vaccine (HPV). Vaccine adverse events are a matter of concern for the public as well as general practitioners; some are within the range of assumptions that adverse reactions after live attenuated vaccines are related to the nature of their parental wild-type viruses. Vaccines stimulate the innate immunity of host immunological defense mechanisms and induce the development of specific acquired immunity. Some adverse events related to autoimmune responses have been reported, such as idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura and acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM). Although a plausible relationship was not demonstrated, the possibility of an association cannot be denied. The pathogenicity of adverse reactions was investigated for anaphylactic reactions, systemic and local reactions following vaccinations. Initial innate immune responses are essential for the development of acquired immunity and are related to adverse events from different viewpoints. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Background: Arthritis and arthralgia are reported as adverse events following immunization with various vaccines.
   Objective: To better understand current knowledge of arthritis and arthralgia as an adverse event following immunization.
   Methods: A systematic literature review of Pubmed, Embase, and Cochrane Library was conducted. Data extraction was performed by two independent reviewers. No restrictions on dates were imposed and all types of vaccine studies with primary data were reviewed.
   Results: Of 343 included studies, there were 206 clinical trials, 90 observational studies, and 47 case reports. Influenza was the most commonly studied vaccine (n = 91, 24.4%). Of the 155 (45.2%) studies addressing causality assessment, 84 studies (54.2%) revealed the assessment method. Only seven clinical trials and 12 observational studies reported a measure of association. Four of these studies examined worsening of arthritic conditions in patients with pre-existing disease. Rigorous assessment of causality was not performed in most studies and many observational studies were prone to bias.
   Conclusions: The current evidence linking vaccination to incident arthritis or worsening of arthritic conditions is too heterogeneous and incomplete to infer a causal association. Recommendations for future studies include use of consistent, standardized case definitions and causality assessments, better control of confounding and minimization of bias, and inclusion of measures of associations.

AB Objectives: Osteosarcoma is one of common malignant tumors worldwide in the metaphysis of teenagers. The role of lncRNAs in Osteosarcoma has become an emerging area of research.
   Materials and methods: Cell migration and invasion were analyzed in Osteosarcoma cell following knockdown or overexpression by transfection with small interfering RNA (siRNA) or treated with LPS. Western blotting and Real-time RT-PCR methods were used to analyze the effects of LPS on EMT.
   Results: We discovered that LPS could regulate cell migration and invasion and promote EMT. At the same time, LPS could regulate the expression of TLR4 and HOTAIR. In addition, knockdown of the expression of TLR4 partially reverses the promotion of cell invasion induced by LPS.
   Conclusions: Our results indicated that LPS coordinate the Osteosarcoma through TLR4/HOTAIR.

AB Monolayer expansion of chondrocytes in culture results in the dedifferentiation of chondrocytes with inferior cartilage specific extracellular matrix synthesis and proliferation when compared with its native counterpart. We aimed to enhance chondrocyte proliferation and articular cartilage specific gene expression through ectopic expression of the major pluripotency transcription factors (Oct4, Sox2, Klf4 and c-Myc). We also aimed to provide insights to the modulation of TGF beta receptor mRNA with Klf4 overexpression.
   Equine chondrocytes pooled from three donors were transduced with lentiviral vectors expressing the induced pluripotency factors, Oct4, Sox2. Klf4 and c-Myc (OSKM), singly, or in combination or together with green fluorescent protein (GFP) as a control. Klf4 and c-Myc overexpressing chondrocytes showed a significant increase in mitosis when compared to the control (P < 0.01 and P < 0.0001 respectively). Furthermore, overexpression of Klf4 or OSKM in three dimensional (3D) culture of equine chondrocytes resulted in a significant increase in Col2a1 mRNA levels relative to the controls (P < 0.05 and P < 0.01 respectively) while all transcription factors significantly lowered the mRNA of the fibrocartilage marker Col1a1. We also employed a Col2a1 promoter driven GFP reporter for real time monitoring of Col2a1 gene activation in 3D micromass culture, which showed significantly higher promoter activity when cultures were treated with the growth factor TGF beta 3 (P < 0.05). The chondrogenic properties of Klf4 transduced chondrocytes at a lower passage (P4) showed significant increases in Sox9 (P < 0.001), Col2a1 (P < 0.05) and TGF beta 3 receptor I (P < 0.05) and II (P < 0.001) expression relative to the DS-Red expressing control. The chondrocyte dedifferentiation marker Col1a1 and hypertrophic marker Col10a1 were significantly downregulated with the inclusion of Klf4 (P < 0.01 and P < 0.05 respectively). In Conclusion, chondrogenic re-differentiation and proliferation of equine chondrocytes is promoted through ectopic expression of Klf4 while suppressing chondrocyte dedifferentiation.

AB Background: The influence of 5-HTT, BMPR2, EDN1, ENG, KCNA5 genes polymorphisms on susceptibility of pulmonary arterial hypertension remains uncertain. This meta-analysis is conducted for further study.
   Methods: We conducted a literature search on PubMed and ISI web of science databases for searching relevant articles until November 2017. Pooled odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated. A total of 17 articles with 2631 PAH subjects and 5139 controls were included in the final meta-analysis. Statistical software Stata13.0 was used for data-analysis.
   Results: A significant relationship was found between the 5-HTT L/S polymorphism and PAH in all the genetic models [LL vs. SS: OR = 1.60, 95% CI, 1.11-2.32; LS vs. SS: OR = 1.55, 95% CI, 1.10-2.21; (LS + LL) vs. SS: OR = 1.56, 95% CI, 1.13-2.17; L vs. 5: OR = 1.32, 95% CI, 1.08-1.62]. There were also associations of the SERT L/S polymorphism with IPAH and PAH in COPD [IPAH L/S: OR = 1.26, 95% CI, 1.01-1.57; PAH in COPD L/S: OR = 1.42, 95% CI, 1.04-1.94]. In addition, the results showed a statistically significant association between EDN1 rs5370 polymorphism and the risk of PAH in all the genetic models [TT vs. GG: OR = 3.32, 95% CI, 1.30-8.51; TG vs. GG: OR = 2.68, 95% CI, 1.54-4.66; (TG + TT) vs. GG: OR = 2.82, 95% CI, 1.69-4.71; T vs. G: OR = 2.43, 95% CI, 1.60-3.68]. However, the significant association was not found between BMPR2 rs1061157, KCNA5 rs10744676, ENG rs3739817 polymorphisms and the risk of PAH (all p > 0.05).
   Conclusions: 5-HTT L/S polymorphism and END1 rs5370 polymorphism were correlated with significantly increased risk of PAH. Moreover, L allele in 5-HTT gene increased susceptibility to IPAH and PAH in COPD.

AB Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathic pain (CIPNP) is a major dose- and therapy-limiting side effect that is particularly difficult to treat. Huachansu, an aqueous extract from toad skin, is a widely used anti-cancer natural product in China. Clinical findings have established the safety and effectiveness of Huachansu in combination with chemotherapy to promote the therapeutic efficacy while alleviate the side effects, especially cancer-related pain symptoms. Unfortunately, experimental data on the effects and mechanisms of Huachansu in combination with chemotherapy is not available. In this study, the effects of Huachansu were tested in vivo on a rat model of oxaliplatin-induced CIPNP. The results show, a single injection of Huachansu 2.5 g/kg produced a short-term analgesic effect on pre-established oxaliplatin-induced CIPNP after 60 min, as indicated by decreased mechanical and thermal hypersensitivity in comparison to oxaliplatin-treated rats. Repeated doses of Huachansu, given during CIPNP induction, prevented the development of oxaliplatin-induced CIPNP. This prophylactic effect of Huachansu was associated with suppressed oxaliplatin-induced TRPV1 up-regulation in the dorsal root ganglia and spinal astrocyte activation. These findings reveal Huachansu therapeutic potential in treating and preventing CIPNP.

AB Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been wildly verified to modulate multiple tumorigeneses, especially nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). In present study, we aim to investigate the role of LINC00319 in the NPC carcinogenesis. It was indicated that LINC00319 was markedly increased in NPC tissues and cells in comparison to their corresponding controls. Moreover, the aberrant overexpression of LINC00319 indicated the poor prognosis of NPC patients. Silence of LINC00319 was able to suppress NPC cell growth in vitro while overexpression of LINC00319 inversed this process. Moreover, in vivo tumor xenografts were established using CNE-1/SUNE-1 cells to investigate the function of LINC00319 in NSCLC tumorigenesis. Rescue assay was performed to further confirm that LINC00319 contributed to NPC progression by regulating miR-1207-5p/KLF12 signal pathway. Taken together, our study discovered the oncogenic role of LINC00319 in clinical specimens and cellular experiments, showing the potential LINC00319/miR-1207-5p/KLF12 pathway. This results and findings provide a novel insight for NPC tumorigenesis.

AB In recent years, the incidence and mortality of colorectal cancer (CRC) have been on a global upward trend. There is an urgent need for effective tools to prevent and treat CRC and reduce morbidity and mortality of CRC patients. Recent evidence suggests that programmed cell death 4 (PDCD4), a novel tumor suppressor gene, inhibits tumor progression at transcriptional and translational levels and regulates multiple signal transduction pathways. However, little is known about the precise mechanisms regulating PDCD4 expression in CRC. In addition, several studies have demonstrated that the expression of in CRC is down-regulated or even absent. PDCD4 is therefore considered to be an independent prognostic factor in CRC and may be a potential support diagnostic tool for distinguishing in normal colon tissue, benign adenoma and CRC. This review will focus on the expression of PDCD4 in CRC and the relevant molecular mechanisms.

AB Long non-coding RNAs (IncRNAs) are RNA molecules with a transcript length of > 200 nt which do not encode proteins, however, they have important functions in the form of RNA at transcriptional level, post-transcriptional level, and epigenetics. MALAT-1 is the first discovered lncRNA in non-small cell lung cancer and its orthologs have been found in zebrafish in the recent years. The present study aimed to determine the expression and possible function of MALAT-1 in the embryonic development of zebrafish. The results of qPCR or in situ hybridization showed that MALAT-1 was dynamically expressed in zebrafish embryonic development and it was widely expressed in brain, eye, heart, and muscle of adult fish. By morpholino knockdown of MALAT-1, zebrafish embryos were found to have smaller body curvature, smaller eyes, enlarged pericardium, and reduced pigmentation. In particular, after morpholino knockdown of MALAT-1, the morphologically defective otic capsule was found to be smaller than the control fish. These results suggest that MALAT-1 may play a key role in the embryonic nervous system development of zebrafish. In addition, we also determined the expressions of seven development-related genes (Scyl1, egr1, oc90, vsx1, nkx2.5, vmhc, and gata4) after MALAT-1 knockdown and found that four genes egr1, nkx2.5, gata4, and vmhc were up-regulated, suggesting a potential regulatory role of MALAT-1 on these development-related genes.

AB GATA transcription factors (TFs), which bind to DNA in regulatory regions, are involved in cell differentiation and possess a type-IV zinc finger and a DNA-binding domain. GATA genes have been characterized in plant species such as Arabidopsis thaliana, Oryza sativa, and Glycine max, and their functions have been elucidated in A. thaliana. Although many Gossypium quantitative trait loci for fiber quality harbor GATA TFs, GATA genes have not yet been characterized in cotton. In this study, we identified 179 GATA genes from the genomes of three Gossypium species. We analyzed the phylogenetic relationships, chromosomal distribution, gene structure, expression pattern, and predicted promoters of all 179 Gossypium GATA genes (46 in G. raimondii, 46 in G. arboreum, and 87 in G. hirsutum). Phylogenetic analysis grouped the 179 GATA genes into four subfamilies. Domain analysis revealed that GATA domains in subfamilies I, II, and III were located near the C-terminal, whereas those in subfamily IV were adjacent to the N-terminal. RNA-seq and (Real-time PCR) qRT-PCR revealed that 39.1% (34/87) of GATA genes were expressed in growing plant tissues in G. hirsutum, but only 12.6% (11/87) were expressed during fiber development. In addition, 45.7% (21/46) and 26.1% (12/46) of GATA genes were expressed in G. arboreum and G. raimondii, respectively. Our results may be useful for elucidating the evolution, expression patterns, and functional divergence of GATA genes in Gossypium.

AB The length of berry lag phase determines the overall time needed for grape berries to get mature, but the functional gene networks in this phase have not been well documented. In order to reveal the origin of the somatic variation and regulation mechanism of grape berry development and ripening, an early ripening mutant of Vitis vinifera with a shorter lag phase was used for transcriptome profiling. The RNA-seq results revealed that 2021 and 2470 genes were up- and down-regulated, respectively, in the early ripening mutant compared to the wild type. The GO and KEGG enrichment analysis indicated that the up-regulated genes belonged to several pathways and metabolisms, among which the most significant constituents were for biosynthesis of secondary metabolites and flavonoid biosynthesis. The down-regulated genes were involved in biosynthesis of secondary metabolites, plant hormone signal transduction, and photosynthesis. Many transcription factors including WRKYs, AP2-EREBPs, and MYBs were also differentially expressed, suggesting their regulatory roles in berry development and ripening. The transcriptomic comparisons suggested that the prominent up-regulation of an Arabidopsis SnRK3.23, CIPK23 or PKS17 homolog could have driven the early ripening phenotype in the mutant by activating the downstream VvABF2 transcription factor in the ABA signaling. At the same time, ethylene and auxin were also involved in this process. As a result, the major ripening related genes, e.g., MYBAI, MYBA2, VvUFGT, GRIP22, and STS were activated in the mutant. The results are of importance for future studies on manipulation of grape berry ripening time.

AB Copy number variation (CNV) related to complex traits, such as disease and quantitative phenotype, is considered an important and wealthy source of genetic and phenotypic diversity. It suggests that the copy number variation of function gene maybe leads to the phenotypic changes. Kupple like factor 3 (KLF3) gene is a vital transcription factor associated with the growth and development of muscle and adipose tissue. It has been mapped in a CNV region by animal genome re-sequencing. In this study, we detected the distribution diversity of KLF3 gene copy numbers in six Chinese cattle breeds (QC, NY, XN, PN, QDM and JX) and associated the phenotypic traits with it. Then, we analyzed the KLF3 gene transcription expression level in different tissues of Jiaxian (JX) cattle. Furthermore, we detected mRNA expression level of muscle and fat tissues of Jiaxian cattle (JX), Angus x Jiaxian (AJ). The results showed that the copy number in CNV loss was more frequent in QC than others. And we revealed a positive effect of KLF3 CNV on growth traits, such as body mass and heart girth (P < 0.05). In a word, we ascertained the significance between CNVs of KLF3 gene and growth traits in different cattle breeds, and our data indicates that the CNVs of KLF3 gene may as a marker for the future molecular breeding of Chinese beef cattle.

AB Non-Synonymous Single-Nucleotide Variants (nsSNVs) and mutations can create a diversity effect on proteins as changing genotype and phenotype, which interrupts its stability. The alterations in the protein stability may cause diseases like cancer. Discovering of nsSNVs and mutations can be a useful tool for diagnosing the disease at a beginning stage. Many studies introduced the various predicting singular and consensus tools that based on different Machine Learning Techniques (MLTs) using diverse datasets. Therefore, we introduce the current comprehensive review of the most popular and recent unique tools that predict pathogenic variations and Meta tool that merge some of them for enhancing their predictive power. Also, we scanned the several types computational techniques in the state-of-the-art and methods for predicting the effect both of coding and noncoding variants. We then displayed, the protein stability predictors. We offer the details of the most common benchmark database for variations including the main predictive features used by the different methods. Finally, we address the most common fundamental criteria for performance assessment of predictive tools.
   This review is targeted at bioinformaticians attentive in the characterization of regulatory variants, geneticists, molecular biologists attentive in understanding more about the nature and effective role of such variants from a functional point of views, and clinicians who may hope to learn about variants in human associated with a specific disease and find out what to do next to uncover how they impact on the underlying mechanisms.

AB Background: Complex otitis media (OM) may present with intact tympanic membrane or spontaneous otorrhea. We compared dynamics of intact tympanic membrane and spontaneous otorrhea OM following 7- and 13-valent conjugated vaccines (PCV7, PCV13) implementation, since differences in dynamics may imply different underlying mechanisms.
   Methods: A prospective, population-based, active surveillance. Episodes with middle-ear fluid cultures in children < 3 years were included. Defined sub-periods were: pre-pneumococcal conjugated vaccines (PCV) (2004-2008); PCV7 (2009-2011); PCV13 (2014-2016). Results: Of 7705 episodes, 57.2% had intact tympanic membrane, 16.8% spontaneous otorrhea, 26.0% unknown.
   In the pre-PCV period, the spontaneous otorrhea group was older and had higher proportions of factors associated with recurrence/chronicity.
   During the PCV7 period, spontaneous otorrhea and intact tympanic membrane episodes caused by PCV13 serotypes decreased significantly (43% and 51%, respectively) and those caused by non-PCV13 serotypes and culture-negative episodes increased significantly. However, rates increases were steeper in the spontaneous otorrhea group for both non-PCV13 serotypes (117% vs. 38%) and culture-negative (720% vs. 69%). In the spontaneous otorrhea group, nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae rates increased non-significantly by 10% and all-cause OM rates increased significantly by 56%, while in the intact tympanic membrane group the respective rates decreased significantly by 22% and 11%. These trends were especially pronounced in ages 24-35 months.
   Despite these differences, after PCV13 introduction, both spontaneous otorrhea and intact tympanic membrane rates declined for all outcomes.
   Conclusions: Spontaneous otorrhea was associated with older age, frequent history of complex OM and delayed PCV impact, suggesting a higher proportion of advanced-stage complex OM. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB We identified 16 Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) presentations from 2012 to 2016 that indicated 'cost' or 'economic' content. Characteristics were reviewed, abstracted, and tabulated to quantify and assess the transparency and consistency of economic evidence presented to ACIP. To assess transparency, we documented if each study identified author affiliation, conflicts of interest, study limitations, a clearly described model structure and other model attributes. To assess consistency, we identified the frequency of specific modeling choices, including the perspective, types of health outcomes considered, inclusion of specific types of costs, discount rate, and use of sensitivity analyses. Our results indicate that the content in these presentations appear to be transparent overall and consistent in several important areas, such as study perspective and health outcomes. However, we find the inclusion of particular types of direct costs, indirect costs, program costs, and sensitivity analyses are areas that could improve consistency. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI Drivers of vaccination preferences to protect a low-value livestock
   resource: Willingness to pay for Newcastle disease vaccines by
   smallholder households

LA English
DT Article
DE Vaccination decision; Contingent valuation; Willingness to pay;
   Veterinary vaccines; Poultry; Food security
AB Vaccination can be an effective risk management approach to minimize the burden of disease and increase livestock productivity for smallholder households in low income countries. In contrast to vaccination of cattle, a high-value smallholder asset, there is a significant knowledge gap for the drivers of vaccine adoption of smallholder poultry. Newcastle disease virus (NDV) causes high mortality in chickens and is one of the greatest constraints to East African poultry production. To determine preferences and willingness to pay for NDV vaccines by chicken-owning households in Tanzania, we administered a survey with a contingent valuation activity to 535 households across six villages in Arusha, Singida, and Mbeya regions. Given the low current vaccination rate, we tested the null hypothesis that smallholder households do not value NDV vaccines and found overwhelming evidence that smallholders do value NDV vaccines. The willingness to pay (WTP) estimate was 5853 Tanzanian shillings ($2.64) to vaccinate ten chickens given the vaccine was protective for a period of three months. This estimate is about twice the market price reported by households in the study areas suggesting chicken-owning households value and benefit from NDV vaccines, but face other barriers to vaccination. Previous vaccination had the largest positive effect size on WTP suggesting smallholders observe benefits from vaccinating. In contrast to studies of vaccination of higher-cost cattle where off-farm income sources often drive willingness to pay, on-farm income was a driver of WTP for NDV vaccines suggesting different drivers affect protection of low-value livestock assets as compared to high-value assets.

AB In the current antibiotic resistance scenario, vaccines may provide best defense against lethal bacterial diseases. So far, there is no ideal vaccine available against plague. Despite providing complete protection in small animal models, F1/LcrV based vaccine failed to provide ideal protection in non human primates. Here, we cloned, expressed and purified YopE of Yersinia pestis and flagellin C (FIiC) of Salmonella Typhi. However the best possible protection needs the significant induction of IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha. To determine the protective potential of the recombinant YopE alone or in formulation with FliC, Balb/C mice were immunized subcutaneously. The formulations were prepared with alum, a human compatible adjuvant. In our studies, the combination of YopE + FIiC induced significantly strong humoral and cellular immune responses. A combination of YopE + FliC provided 83% protection whereas YopE alone provided only 50% against 1 OOLD50 of Y. pestis in a mouse model. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background: Due to competing health priorities, low- and middle-income countries (LMIC) may need to prioritize between different influenza vaccine risk groups. Risk group prioritization may differ in LMIC based upon programmatic feasibility, country-specific prevalence of risk conditions and influenza associated morbidity and mortality.
   Methods: In South Africa, we collected local disease burden data (both published and unpublished) and published vaccine efficacy data in risk groups and healthy adults. We used these data to aid policy makers with risk group prioritization for influenza vaccination. We used the following formula to assess potential vaccine averted disease in each risk group: rate of influenza-associated hospitalization (or death) per 100,000 population * influenza vaccine efficacy (VE). We further estimated the cost per hospital day averted and the cost per year of life saved by influenza vaccination.
   Results: Pregnant women, HIV-infected adults, and adults and children with tuberculosis disease had among the highest estimates of hospitalizations averted per 100,000 vaccinated and adults aged 65 years and older had the highest estimated deaths averted per 100,000 vaccinated. However, when assessing both the cost per hospital day averted (range: USD148-1,344) and the cost per year of life saved (range: USD112-1,230); adults and children with TB disease, HIV-infected adults and pregnant women had the lowest cost per outcome averted.
   Discussion: An assessment of the potential disease outcomes averted and associated costs may aid policymakers in risk group prioritization for influenza vaccination. (C) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd. This is an open access article under the CC BY license.

In 2016, a systematic review by Higgins et al., commissioned by the WHO Strategic Advisory Group of Experts (SAGE) on immunization, estimated the relative risk (RR) of all-cause mortality after whole-cell Diphtheria-Tetanus-Pertussis (DTwP) vaccination to be 1.38 (95% CI: 0.92-2.08), and described these potential NSEs as inconsistent. However, the selection of studies for meta-analysis, based on their proneness to bias and confounding, was debated.
   Objective: To identify study characteristics and postulated risks of bias and confounding that might have impacted the RR of all-cause mortality after DTwP vaccination in observational studies conducted in low-income countries.
   Methods: Based on methodological considerations on study design and analysis, we systematically assessed all 17 DTwP studies from the Higgins et al. review for risk of selection bias, exposure and outcome misclassification, confounding and differential co-interventions. We used meta-regression to assess the impact of study characteristics and the postulated risks of bias and confounding on the RR estimates, and looked for outlying and influential risk estimates. Permutation tests were performed to control for false-positive findings.
   Results: The overall RR of all-cause mortality after DTwP vaccination including all but one outlying and influential study was 1.32 (95% CI: 0.83-2.08). Based on uni-variable meta-regression, we found that study location (p = 0.01), studies using the landmark approach (p = 0.015) and studies at high risk of exposure misclassification (p = 0.036) were significantly associated with increased RR estimates whereas studies at high risk of selection bias (p = 0.059) showed borderline significance. The results further suggest these effect modifiers are clustered in studies conducted in West-Africa.
   Conclusion: The increased RR of all-cause mortality after DTwP might be confined to West-African countries and/or certain postulated risks of bias might have inflated these RRs.

ID MENINGOCOCCAL DISEASE
AB Background: Vaccine-preventable invasive bacterial diseases (IBDs) caused by Neisseria meningitidis (Nm), Streptococcus pneumoniae (Sp), and Haemophilus influenzae (Hi) have been notified in Italy since 2007 without assessing reporting completeness.
   Methods: Our study compared the number of cases of IBDs identified from the Italian Hospital Discharge Records (HDRs), using specific diagnostic ICD-9-CM codes, with those notified to the National Surveillance System (NSS) from 2007 to 2016. A multinomial logistic regression model was used to impute the aetiology of all discharges with a diagnosis of unspecified bacterial meningitis.
   Results: Over a 10-year period, 14,243 hospital discharges with diagnosis of IBD were estimated in Italy (12,671 with specified aetiology and 1,572 with imputed aetiology). Among those, 2,513 (17.6%) were caused by Nm, 10,441 (73.3%) by Sp, and 1289 (9.1%) by Hi. Most invasive meningococcal diseases were coded as meningitis (72.3%), while Hi and Sp were more frequently coded as septicaemia (51.6% and 60.4%, respectively). The highest mean annual incidence rate was found for IBD caused by Sp (1.74 per 100,000), followed by Nm (0.42 per 100,000) and by Hi (0.21 per 100,000). Comparing NSS with HDR data, we found an initially high underreporting of all IBDs, and particularly for Hi. Data from the two systems overlapped in more recent years, due to an improved reporting completeness. The increasing IBD incidence observed in NSS data was not confirmed by HDR data trends, although with pathogen-related differences with Hi cases rising in both data sources, suggesting that is mainly due to an improved disease notification rather than to a true incidence increase.
   Conclusions: Comparing surveillance data with other data sources is useful to better interpret observed trends of notifiable diseases. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background and objectives: Over the last decades, medicinal regulations have been put into place and have considerably improved manufacturing practices. Nevertheless, safety issues may still arise. Using the simulation described in this manuscript, our aim is to develop adequate detection methods for manufacturing-related safety signals, especially in the context of biological products.
   Methods: Pharmaceutical companies record the entire batch genealogies, from seed batches over intermediates to final product (FP) batches. We constructed a hierarchical tree based on this genealogy information and linked it to the spontaneous safety data available for the FP batch numbers. The tree-based scan statistic (TBSS) was used on simulated data as a proof of concept to locate the source that may have subsequently generated an excess of specific adverse events (AEs) within the manufacturing steps, and to evaluate the method's adjustment for multiple testing. All calculations were performed with a customized program in SAS v9.2.
   Results: The TBSS generated a close to expected number of false positive signals, demonstrating that it adjusted for multiple testing. Overall, the method detected 71% of the simulated signals at the correct production step when a 6-fold increase in reports with AEs of interest (AEOI) was applied, and 31% when a 2-fold increase was applied. The relatively low detection performance may be attributed to the higher granularity associated with the lower levels of the hierarchy, leading to a lack of power and the stringent definition criteria that were applied for a true positive result.
   Conclusion: As a data-mining method for manufacturing-related safety signal detection, the TBSS may provide advantages over other disproportionality analyses (using batch information) but may benefit from complementary methods (not relaying on batch information). While the method warrants further refinement, it may improve safety signal detection and contribute to improvements in the quality of manufacturing processes. (C) 2018 GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals SA.

AB Over the course of this project, we utilized pharmacists at 159 community pharmacies in Nebraska and Iowa to administer vaccinations to adults 19 years of age or older with the objective of improving immunization rates in both states. We implemented a pharmacy-based technology platform and partnered with public health via the state immunization registries of both states to ensure that immunizations provided at the pharmacy were transmitted to the statewide registry, for which reporting is currently voluntary for health care providers. After using the technology platform for one year, an increase of immunization rates for influenza, herpes zoster, and pertussis vaccination rates by 37%, 12%, and 74%, respectively, was recorded in comparison to the prior year numbers. However, there was about 16% decrease in vaccination rates for pneumococcal vaccine. For the first time, the project's participating pharmacies in Nebraska reported immunization counts to their state's immunization registries. This project leveraged community pharmacies as healthcare destinations to achieve further gains in increasing immunization rates, improving the health of adults, and creating a community-wide network for prevention.

   TRIAL
AB Background: Although development of an HSV vaccine is a priority there is currently no vaccine available. The recent failure of subunit vaccines suggest that presentation of more antigens via a live attenuated vaccine may be required for protection. We therefore evaluated VC2, a live attenuated HSV vaccine, engineered to be unable to enter into neuronal axons.
   Methods: VC2 pathogenesis was first evaluated in guinea pigs following intravaginal inoculation. VC2 was then evaluated as a prophylactic and therapeutic vaccine and compared protection to a gD2 vaccine adjuvanted with MPL/Alum in the guinea pig model of genital HSV-2. The guinea pig model allows evaluation of acute and recurrent disease, as well as vaginal shedding acutely and during episodes of recurrent activation.
   Results: VC2 was significantly attenuated in guinea pigs compared to the wild type strain, 17syn+. It replicated poorly at the inoculation site, did not produce any genital disease and rarely infected the neural tissue. After prophylactic vaccination, the VC2 vaccine decreased the clinical severity of acute and recurrent HSV-2 disease and shedding and decreased the quantity of virus in the DRGs. When compared to gD2+MPL/Alum, VC2 was somewhat more effective especially as it relates to neural tissue infection. VC2 was not effective as a therapeutic vaccine.
   Conclusion: The live attenuated prophylactic HSV vaccine, VC2, was effective in the guinea pig model of genital HSV-2. Its decreased ability to infect neural tissues provides advantages over other live attenuated vaccines. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

ID OCCUPATIONAL VACCINES; PREVENTABLE DISEASES; ATTITUDES; PERSONNEL;

AB Introduction: Mandatory policies have the potential to increase uptake of influenza ('flu') vaccination among healthcare workers (HCWs), but concerns have been expressed about their acceptability and effectiveness. We explored views on three mandatory policies (declination forms, face masks or reduced patient contact, and mandatory vaccination) among both HCWs and flu vaccination programme managers in the National Health Service (NHS) in England.
   Method: A mixed method approach was employed. An online cross-sectional survey was conducted with staff responsible for implementing influenza campaigns in NHS trusts (healthcare organisations) in England (n = 72 trusts). The survey measured perceived effectiveness of the three mandatory policies and perceived support for them among HCWs. Qualitative interviews were conducted in four trusts, with influenza campaign managers (n = 24) and with HCWs who had the opportunity to receive the influenza vaccination (n = 32). Interviews explored respondents' views of the three strategies and were analysed thematically using QSR NVivo 11 All data were collected shortly after the 2016/2017 influenza season.
   Results: In the survey, views varied on the effectiveness of the three policies and none of the interventions were thought to be strongly supported by HCWs, with particularly low levels of support perceived for mandatory vaccination and for face masks or reduced patient contact. The qualitative interviews revealed substantial concerns around the practicability and enforceability of mandatory policies and the potential discriminatory effect on HCWs who made a principled decision or had medical reasons for exemption. Additional doubts were also expressed regarding the effectiveness of face masks and their potential to worry patients, and the ethics of compelling staff to accept medical intervention.
   Discussion: Mandatory vaccination and face masks would not be strongly supported if introduced in the UK. If declination forms are adopted, they should be used in a constructive intelligence-gathering manner which avoids stigmatising HCWs. (C) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Background: Febrile seizures are associated with the first dose of measles-containing vaccines and the risk increases with chronologic age during the second year of life. We used the Vaccine Safety Datalink (VSD) to determine if the relative increase in risk of seizures following receipt of measles-containing vaccine differs by gestational age at birth.
   Methods: Children were eligible if they received their first dose of measles-containing vaccine at age 12 through 23 months from January 2003 through September 2015. Children were excluded if they had a history of seizure or conditions strongly related to seizure prior to 12 months of age. Seizures were identified by diagnostic codes in the inpatient or emergency department settings. Using risk-interval analysis, we estimated the incidence rate ratio (IRR) for seizures in the 7 through 10 days (risk period) vs 15 through 42 days (control period) following receipt of measles-containing vaccines in children born pre term (<37 weeks gestation age) and those born full-term (>= 37 weeks).
   Results: There were 532,375 children (45,343 preterm and 487,032 full-term) who received their first dose of measles-containing vaccine at age 12 through 23 months. The IRRs of febrile seizures 7 through 10 days compared with 15 through 42 days after receipt of measles-containing vaccine were 3.9 (95% CI: 2.5-6.0) in preterm children and 3.2 (2.7-3.7) in full-term children; the ratio of IRRs: was 1.2 (0.76-1.9), p = 0.41. IRRs were also similar across gestational age groups, by vaccine type received (measles-mumps rubella [MMR] or measles-mumps-rubella-varicella [MMRV]) and age at vaccination (12-15 or 16-23 months).
   Conclusion: Vaccination with a measles-containing vaccine in the second year of life is associated with a similar relative risk of a first seizure in children born preterm as in those who were born full-term. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Current acellular-pertussis (aP) vaccines appear inadequate for long-term pertussis control because of short-lived efficacy and the increasing prevalence of pertactin-negative isolates which may negatively impact vaccine efficacy. In this study, we added fimbriae (FIM)2 and FIM3 protein to licensed 2-, 3- or 5-component aP vaccines (Pentavac (R), Boostrix (R), Adacel (R), respectively) to assess whether an aP vaccine with enhanced FIM content demonstrates enhanced efficacy. Vaccine-induced protection was assessed in an intranasal mouse challenge model. In addition, potential reactogenicity was measured by biomarkers in a human whole blood assay (WBA) in vitro and benchmarked the responses against licensed whole cell pertussis (wP) and aP vaccines including Easyfive (R), Pentavac (R) and Pentacel (R). The results show that commercial vaccines demonstrated reduced efficacy against pertactin-negative versus pertactin-positive strains. However, addition of higher amounts of FIM2/3 to aP vaccines reduced lung colonization and increased vaccine efficacy against a pertactin-negative strain in a dose-dependent manner. Improvements in efficacy were similar for FIM2 and FIM3-expressing strains. Increasing the amount of FIM2/3 proteins in aP formulations did not alter vaccine-induced biomarkers of potential reactogenicity including prostaglandin E-2, cytokines and chemokines in human newborn cord and adult peripheral blood tested in vitro. These results suggest that increasing the quantity of FIM proteins in current pertussis vaccine formulations may further enhance vaccine efficacy against B. pertussis infection without increasing the reactogenicity of the vaccine.

AB Streptococcus pneumoniae is a well-known pathogenic bacterium with a high mortality rate. Currently, a 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPV23) and protein-conjugate vaccines (PCVs) are available on the market. However, both of these vaccines have limitations; specifically, PPV23 produces weak antibody responses in children younger than 2 years and PCVs only partially protect against secondary infection. Previously, we showed serotype-nonspecific protection by Delta pep27 vaccine, but the reversion of Delta pep27 to the wild type serotype during immunization cannot be excluded. To ensure the safety of the Delta pep27 vaccine, comD, an important protein that activates competence, was inactivated, and the transformability of the double mutant (Delta pep27 Delta comD)was determined. The transformation ability of this double mutant was successfully abolished. Delta pep27 Delta comD immunization significantly increased the survival time after heterologous challenge(s), and diminished colonization levels independent of serotype, including a non-typeable strain (NCC1). Moreover, the double mutant was found to be highly safe in both normal and immunocompromised mice. In conclusion, this pneumococcal Delta pep27 Delta comD vaccine appears to be a highly feasible and safe vaccine to prevent various types of pneumococcal infections. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Young children - the main asymptomatic carriers of pneumococcus - are often the source of pneumococcal infections. PCV13 replaced PCV7 in 2010 in Hungary and it became a mandatory vaccine in 2014. In this work we surveyed the effect of vaccination in three groups: in healthy children under 7 years; in children of the same age but infected with pneumococcus (P1); in older patients (P2) who were very likely not vaccinated.
   Nasal swabs were taken from 522 healthy children to screen pneumococcal carriage between March 2015 and May 2016. In the same time period, 146 clinical isolates were collected, mainly from mucosal infections. Serotypes, antibiotic susceptibility and clonality of the isolates was determined and compared.
   The carriage rate was 39.1%. Regarding carriage, the serotype distribution showed the total disappearance of serotypes 3 and 6A compared to former Hungarian studies. The prevalence of PCV13 serotypes was only 5.8% represented by three serotypes (19F, 19A, 9V). Of note, serotype 19A (a very resistant and invasive type) also decreased significantly. In the patient groups, PCV13 prevalence was higher: 17.5% (P1) and 32.6% (P2). Although serotype 3 was present in P1 (7.9%), the leading serotype was 23B (22.2%), a non-vaccine type (NVT). P2 showed the most diverse serotype distribution, but serotype 3 was predominant here (15.7%). Pneumococcal isolates from the patients were more resistant towards the tested antibiotics compared to those from carriers.
   PCV13 seems to be highly successful in reducing the prevalence of vaccine serotypes. The serotype-rearrangement can be seen also among clinical isolates, albeit somewhat later in time. Fortunately, the replacing serotypes are less invasive and less resistant, but, most worrisome, serotype 19F can be found again with increased frequency among carriage isolates and mucosal infections. Further surveillance is needed to carefully monitor such successful, antibiotic resistant "refugees". (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This cross-sectional study aimed to assess pertussis seroprevalence among healthy healthcare workers (HCW) of the Children's Hospital of Tunis, Tunisia. During the study period, 236 blood samples were obtained to determine HCW exposure to pertussis. Concentrations of immunoglobulin G (IgG) to pertussis toxin (PT) were measured using a commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Cut-offs values used were 40 and 100 IU/ml, respectively indicative of an infection within the last year and a current/recent infection. Overall, seropositivity rate was 11.4% (95% CI 7.4-15.5) and 2.5% (95% Cl 0.5-4.6) of ELISA results were indicative of a current infection. Seroprevalence was significantly most important in nurses (p = 0.03) and in participants aged 21-31y (p = 0.009). Our study confirmed that pertussis is circulating in hospital settings and affecting Tunisian HCW, in close contact with infants. Therefore, a booster dose of acellular pertussis vaccine needs to be considered. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Evaluation of antigen-specific T-cell responses to viral antigens is frequently performed on IFN-gamma secreting cells. However, T-cells are capable of producing many more functions than just IFN-gamma, some of which, like Perforin, are associated with immune protection in HIV-1 disease elite controllers. We evaluated the extent of missed T-cell functions when IFN-gamma secretion is used as a surrogate marker for further evaluation of T-cell functions. Intracellular cytokine staining assay and flow cytometry were used to assess peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from 31 HIV-infected ART-naive individuals for the extent to which gated CD4+ and CD8+ IFN-gamma producing and non-producing T-cells also secreted IL-2, Perforin, and TNF-alpha functions. Similarly, the extent of missed virus-specific responses in IFN-gamma ELISpot assay negative T-cells from 5 HIV-1 uninfected individuals was evaluated. Cells from HIV-infected individuals were stimulated with pooled consensus group M (Con M) peptides; and those from healthy individuals were stimulated with pooled adenovirus (Ad) peptides. Overall, frequencies of virus-specific IFN-gamma secreting CD4+ and CD8+ cells were low. Proportions of IFN-gamma negative CD4+ expressing IL-2, Perforin, or TNF-alpha to Con M were significantly higher (5 of 7 functional profiles) than the corresponding IFN-y positive CD4+ (0 of 7) T-cell phenotype, p = 0.02; Fisher's Exact test. Likewise, proportions of CD8+ T-cells expressing other functions were significantly higher in 4 of the 7 IFN-gamma negative CD8+ T-cells. Notably, newly stimulated Perforin, identified as Perforin co-expression with IL-2 or TNF-alpha, was significantly higher in IFN-gamma negative CD8+ T-cell than in the positive CD8+ T-cells. Using SEB, lower responses in IFN-gamma positive cells were most associated with CD4+ than CD8+ T-cells. These findings suggest that studies evaluating immunogenicity in response to HIV and Adenovirus viral antigens should not only evaluate T-cell responsiveness among IFN-gamma producing cells but also among those T-cells that do not express IFN-gamma.

AB Immunization with the live-attenuated Yersinia pseudotuberculosis VTnF1 strain producing a Yersinia pestis F1 pseudocapsule efficiently protects mice against bubonic and pneumonic plague. In clinical trials, demonstration of a plague vaccine's efficacy in humans will not be feasible, and correlates of protection will be needed to bridge the immune response of protected animals to that of vaccinated humans. Using serum transfer and vaccination of antibody-deficient MT mice, we established that both humoral and cellular responses elicited by VTnF1 independently conferred protection against bubonic plague. Thus, correlates were searched for in both responses, using blood only. Mice were vaccinated with increasing doses of VTnF1 to provide a range of immune responses and survival outcomes. The cellular response was evaluated using an in vitro IFN gamma release assay, and IFN gamma levels were significantly associated with protection, although some survivors were negative for IFN gamma, so that IFN gamma release is not a fully satisfactory correlate. Abundant serum IgG against the F1 capsule, Yop injectable toxins, and also non-F1 Y. pestis antigens were found, but none against the LcrV antigen. All readouts correlated to survival and to each other, confirming that vaccination triggered multiple protective mechanisms developing in parallel. Anti-F1 IgG was the most stringent correlate of protection, in both inbred BALB/c mice and outbred OFI mice. This indicates that antibodies (Ab) to F1 play a dominant role for protection even in the presence of Ab to many other targets. Easy to measure, the anti-F1 IgG titer will be useful to evaluate the immune response in other animal species and in clinical trials. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Inactivated poliomyelitis vaccine made from Sabin strains (sIPV) has been encouraged to introduce in the "Global Polio Eradication & Endgame Strategic Plan" and increasingly used worldwide. Attenuated Sabin strains used in manufacture of oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV) and sIPV may regain full or partial neurovirulence during growth in vaccine recipients and the vaccine manufacturing processes. Ensuring the molecular consistency of sIPV batches and that no mutation accumulates beyond the level present in past batches are important for quality control of vaccine manufacture process. Direct deep-sequencing allows the construction of a library of virus RNA and the detection of genetic mutations throughout the viral genome. In the present study, direct deep-sequencing was conducted to detect molecular mutations in virus passages, multiple sIPV monovalent lots, and virus monovalent lots from different polio type Ill strains. The results indicated that direct deep-sequencing can be used to identify and quantify small amounts of mutant viruses in vaccine preparations, trace the source of a specific virus seed, and monitor the batch-to-batch consistency of vaccines, suggesting that this technique could be suitable for the quality control and consistency monitoring of sIPV production.

AB Diverse HPV subtypes are responsible for considerable disease burden worldwide, necessitating safe, cheap, and effective vaccines. The HPV minor capsid protein L2 is a promising candidate to create broadly protective HPV vaccines, though it is poorly immunogenic by itself. To create highly immunogenic and safe vaccine candidates targeting L2, we employed a plant-based recombinant protein expression system to produce two different vaccine candidates: L2 displayed on the surface of hepatitis B core (HBc) virus-like particles (VLPs) or L2 genetically fused to an immunoglobulin capable of forming recombinant immune complexes (RIC). Both vaccine candidates were potently immunogenic in mice, but were especially so when delivered together, generating very consistent and high antibody titers directed against HPV L2 (>1,000,000) that correlated with virus neutralization. These data indicate a novel immune response synergy upon co-delivery of VLP and RIC platforms, a strategy that can be adapted generally for many different antigens. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Background: Health care workers (HCWs) are at high risk of contracting blood-borne infections including hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. In Japan, all HCWs are required to receive HB vaccination before beginning work. This study aimed to investigate the dynamics of the HB surface antibody (anti-HBs) titer after a three-dose HB vaccination in HCWs and to determine effective scheduling of HB vaccination for non responders.
   Methods: Subjects included 832 medical and dental students who had received a three-dose HB vaccination (Bimmugen (R) 0.5 ml/vial). Anti-HBs was measured three times (before the third dose and 1 and 5 months after the third dose) using the CLIA method. The cut-off value of anti-HBs acquisition was 10 mlU/mL. After booster doses (three maximum) were administered to non-responders, the anti-HBs titers were measured again.
   Results: Out of 832 students, 491 were analyzed, of which 58.9% (289) were male. Anti-HBs-positive rates before the third dose and 1 and 5 months later were 47.9%, 95.9%, and 89.0%, respectively. The relationship between the antibody titer at one month (x) and 5 months (y) was estimated by log(10)y = log(10)- x - 0.134 (P < 0.0001). Twelve non-responders were followed-up, all of which acquired a protective anti-HBs titer after revaccination with a three-dose booster.
   Conclusion: Anti-HBs titer decreases by an average of 20% within 4 months between the 1st and 5th month after the third dose. Therefore, anti-HBs titer should be measured periodically after completing the three-dose vaccination. Additionally, results suggested that booster doses are effective if administered with the same schedule as primary vaccination. (C) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Background: The prevalence of vaccine-preventable diseases in adults remains a significant public health issue in the United States. The objectives of this demonstration project were to increase the number of influenza, pneumococcal, pertussis, and herpes zoster immunizations administered to adults by community pharmacists, evaluate the percentage of immunizations documented in the state immunization information system (IIS), and design and pilot a value-based payment model.
   Methods: A one-year prospective, observational demonstration project was conducted in 70 community pharmacies in western Washington State from September 1, 2016 to August 31, 2017. An immunization interface was integrated into workflow at each pharmacy to enable "forecasting" of and proactive recommendation to patients about their vaccine needs and documentation of vaccines administered in the state IIS. Categorical value-based payment models were developed and implemented in a subgroup of 12 community pharmacies from March 1 to November 30, 2017. The change in the number of immunizations administered in comparison to the baseline period and the percentage of immunizations documented in the state IIS during the demonstration period were analyzed using descriptive statistics.
   Results: There was a 15% total increase in the collective number of influenza, pneumococcal, pertussis, and herpes zoster vaccines administered in the demonstration year in the 70 pharmacies, due to increases in influenza and pertussis vaccinations. Eighty-three percent of the vaccines administered were documented in the state IIS. Pneumococcal, pertussis, and herpes zoster performance appeared to be unaffected by the value-based payment models while influenza performance improved across the 12 pilot pharmacies.
   Conclusions: This work demonstrated that community pharmacists contribute to improving adult immunizations through vaccine "forecasting" and proactive recommendation. Meaningful quality measures with both positive and negative incentives could further drive adoption of best immunization practices. Further implementation and outcomes research is needed to fully examine the impact and scalability of these strategies. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Vaccination is an effective strategy to prevent pneumococcal diseases. Currently, licensed vaccines include the pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPSV) and the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV), which target some of the most common of the 94 serotypes of S. pneumoniae based on their capsular composition. However, it has been reported that PPSV is not effective in children aged less than 2 years old and PCV induces serotype replacement, which means that the pneumococcal population has changed following widespread introduction of these vaccines, and the non-vaccine serotypes have increased in being the cause of invasive pneumococcal disease. Therefore, it is important that there is development of novel pneumococcal vaccines to either replace or complement current polysaccharide based vaccines. Our previous study suggested that S. pneumoniae releases elongation factor Tu (EF-Tu) through autolysis followed by the induction of proinflammatory cytokines in macrophages via toll-like receptor 4, that may contribute to the development of pneumococcal diseases. In this study, we investigated the expression of EF-Tu in various S. pneumoniae strains and whether EF-Tu could be an antigen candidate for serotype-independent vaccine against pneumococcal infection. Western blotting and flow cytometry analysis revealed that EF-Tu is a common factor expressed on the surface of all pneumococcal strains tested, as well as intracellularly. In addition, we demonstrate that immunization with recombinant (r) EF-Tu induced the production of inflammatory cytokines and the IgG1 and lgG2a antibodies in mice, and increased the CD4(+) T-cells proportion in splenocytes. We also reveal that anti-EF-Tu serum increased the phagocytic activity of mouse peritoneal macrophages against S. pneumoniae infection, independent of their serotypes. Finally, our results indicate that mice immunized with rEF-Tu were significantly and non-specifically protected against lethal challenges with S. pneumoniae serotypes (2 and 15A). Therefore, pneumococcal EF-Tu could be an antigen candidate for the serotype-independent vaccine against pneumococcal infection. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

   The CRS cases reported to the Spanish National Epidemiological Surveillance Network between 1997 and 2016 were studied, and the epidemiological, clinical, diagnostic and maternal characteristics of newborns with CRS described. The incidence of CRS was calculated using Birth Statistics from the Spanish National Statistics Agency (INE).
   Twenty-three cases of CRS were reported, 70% of which were associated with rubella outbreaks. The most common clinical conditions were heart disease (52.2%), deafness (39.1%) and cataracts (30.4%); 91.3% of cases were confirmed by laboratory testing. 70.0% were born from a non-vaccinated foreign mother, resident in Spain (cumulative rate incidence (CR): 1.1/100,000 births), with mothers coming from Africa (36.0%), Latin America (29.0%), Eastern Europe (21.0%) and Asia (14.0%). Six were born to Spanish mothers (CR: 0.08/100,000 births), the last of which were in 2005.
   The majority of CRS cases were born to unvaccinated immigrant women infected in Spain during rubella outbreaks. Universal vaccination in childhood is the most efficient strategy to prevent rubella. The limited circulation of the virus will, however, quickly lead to a loss of awareness about rubella among clinicians and epidemiologists. It is necessary to maintain protocols capable of identifying signs consistent with rubella in pregnant women and signs suggestive of congenital rubella in newborns. (C) 2018 The Authors.

AB Background: We assessed 2 investigational 11- and 12-valent vaccines, containing capsular polysaccharides of 10 serotypes as in the pneumococcal non-typeable Haemophilus influenzae protein D-conjugate vaccine (PHiD-CV) and CRIA(197)-conjugated capsular polysaccharides of serotypes 19A (11-valent) or 19A and 6A (12-valent).
   Methods: In this phase II, partially-blind, multicentre study (NCT01204658), healthy infants were randomised (1:1:1:1) to receive 11vPHiD-CV, 12vPHiD-CV, PHiD-CV, or 13-valent CRM197-conjugate pneumococcal vaccine (PCV13), at 2, 3, and 4 (primary series), and 12-15 months of age (booster dose), co-administered with DTPa-HBV-IPV/Hib. Confirmatory objectives assessed non-inferiority of investigational vaccines to comparators (PHiD-CV for common serotypes; PCV13 for 19A and 6A), in terms of percentage of infants with pneumococcal antibody concentrations >= 0.2 mu g/mL and antibody geometric mean concentrations, post-primary vaccination. Reactogenicity and safety were assessed.
   Results: 951 children received >= 1 primary dose, 919 a booster dose. Pre-defined immunological non inferiority criteria were met simultaneously for 9/11 11vPHiD-CV serotypes (all except 23F and 19A) and 10/12 12vPHiD-CV serotypes (all except 19A and 6A); thus, non-inferiority objectives were reached.
   For each PHiD-CV serotype, percentages of children with antibody concentrations >= 0.2 AgirnL were >96.7% post-primary (except 6B [>= 75.2%] and 23F [>= 81.1%]), and >= 98.1% post-booster vaccination. For each PHiD-CV serotype except serotype 1, >= 81.0% and >= 93.9% of children had opsonophagocytic activity titres >= 8, post-primary and booster vaccination. AEs incidence was similar across all groups. SAEs were reported for 117 children (29 in the 11vPHiD-CV group, 26 in the 12vPHiD-CV group, 38 in the PHiD-CV group and 24 in the PCV13 group); 4 SAEs were considered vaccination-related. No fatal events were recorded.
   Conclusion: Addition of 19A and 6A CRM197-conjugates did not alter immunogenicity of the PHiD-CV conjugates; for both investigational vaccines post-booster immune responses to 10 common serotypes appeared similar to those elicited by PHiD-CV. Safety and reactogenicity profiles of the investigational vaccines were comparable to PHiD-CV. (C) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd. This is an open access article under the CC BY license.

AB Purpose: Human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine series completion rates among females and males remain low in Florida (46.4% and 34.5%, respectively). Multiple stakeholders influence vaccination uptake, including health care providers (HCPs), public health professionals (PHPs), and members of professional organizations. We examined stakeholder efforts related to increasing vaccine uptake and education among parents/adolescents and HCPs.
   Methods: We conducted an environmental scan of stakeholder efforts and identified stakeholders using our professional networks and a snowball sampling approach. Stakeholders (n = 46) completed a survey about involvement in and barriers to vaccination promotion efforts. A subset (n = 12) of stakeholders participated in follow-up interviews further exploring vaccination efforts and barriers, Survey data were analyzed using descriptive statistics. Interview data were analyzed using deductive analysis and coded using constructs from the PRECEDE-PROCEED model.
   Results: The majority of our survey sample was PHPs (50.0%) and HCPs (32.6%). Stakeholder efforts were focused on adolescent/parent/HCP education including providing: educational materials for HCPs (55.8%) and adolescents/parents (59.6%), one-on-one consultations for adolescents/parents (55.3%), and HCP education (54.7%). Lack of knowledge/understanding and education/information were barriers reported across almost all groups/areas. Office staff/HCP education and distribution of patient education materials were efforts described as important during qualitative interviews. Stakeholders also noted HCP discomfort when recommending HPV vaccine, parental perceptions that the vaccine is unnecessary, and a lack of education/understanding among parents and HCPs.
   Conclusions: Results suggest the need for parent/adolescent education, specifically targeting key areas we identified: importance and benefits of HPV vaccine, and education and skill building in vaccine communication for HCPs. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Objective: The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommends Hepatitis B (HepB) vaccine for previously unvaccinated adults <60 years with diabetes mellitus. This observational retrospective cohort study assessed the impact of implementing electronic provider reminders on HepB vaccine initiation and 3-dose series completion rates among insured adults with diabetes aged 19-59 years old.
   Research design and methods: Difference-in-difference (DID) analyses compared changes in vaccine initiation and completion rates (ratio of the rate ratio [RRR] and 95% confidence interval [CI]) during 12 months pre- and post-implementation between intervention and control sites. We examined trends in vaccine initiation and completion rates by plotting monthly rates during the study period. We also calculated the overall HepB vaccine coverage rates with 95% CI among all adults with diabetes aged 19-59 years old at the start and end date of the study period.
   Results: Baseline HepB vaccine initiation and completion rates were similar at both the intervention and control sites. Gender, age, and race/ethnicity distributions within both sites were similar during the 12 months pre- and post-implementation. DID analyses demonstrated statistically significant differences in the changes of the annual vaccine initiation rates (RRR: 70.7, 95% CI: 62.8-79.6) and the third dose completion rates (RRR = 18.7, 95% CI: 14.2-24.8) between the two sites. The coverage increased significantly at the intervention site while it remained low at the control site.
   Conclusions: Use of provider reminders is highly effective in increasing both HepB vaccine initiation and series completion rates among adults with diabetes. (C) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd. This is an open access article under the CC BY-NC-ND license.

AB Rubella vaccination programs have dramatically reduced the incidence of rubella and congenital rubella syndrome (CRS) in developed countries. However, CRS prevalence is still rising in developing countries where rubella-containing vaccines (RCV) are not included in the immunization program and even in some countries where a part of the population lacks immunity to rubella despite the presence of RCV in the regular immunization program. This review aimed to summarize the clinical features of CRS using data from our studies conducted between 2011 and 2015 in Vietnam, wherein we examined clinical manifestations in Vietnamese children with CRS who were born after the large rubella outbreak of 2011; a series of studies dealing with CRS in North America and Europe after the 1960s epidemic; and those from countries before introduction of RCVS.
   This review shows that children with CRS have a variety of disabilities such as hearing, visual, developmental, behavioral, cardiac, and endocrine impairments, which have variable severity and may appear in different combinations. Some of these impairments can appear or worsen later in the lives of these children.
   Physicians should thus complete pediatric, cardiac, auditory, ophthalmologic, and neurologic examinations along with laboratory diagnostic testing soon after birth. These assessments should be repeated during follow-up if congenital rubella infection is suspected in a neonate. Timely intervention for cardiac defects can be lifesaving. Early introduction and continuation of speech, occupational, physical, and behavior therapies and training with appropriate medical interventions by a multidisciplinary team approach are required to maximize quality of life.

AB Appropriately selecting methods for characterizing the reaction system of zerovalent iron (ZVI) favors its application for water treatment and remediation. Hence, a survey of the available ZVI characterization techniques used in laboratory and field studies are presented in this review for clarifying the characteristic properties, (in-situ) corrosion processes, and corrosion products of ZVI system. The methods are generally classified into four broad categories: morphology characterization techniques, (sub-)surface and bulk analysis mainly via the spectral protocols, along with the (physio)electrochemical alternatives. Moreover, this paper provides a critical review on the scopes and applications of ZVI characterization methodologies from several perspectives including their suitable occasions, availability, (semi-)quantitative/qualitative evaluations, in/ex-situ reaction information, advantages, limitations and challenges, as well as economic and technical remarks. In particular, the characteristic spectroscopic peak locations of typical iron (oxyhydr)oxides are also systematically summarized. In view of the complexity and variety of ZVI system, this review further addresses that different characterization methods should be employed together for better assessing the performance and mechanisms of ZVI-involved systems and thereby facilitating the deployment of ZVI-based installations in real practice.

AB Objectives: Finding recent clinical studies that warrant changes in clinical practice ("high impact" clinical studies) in a timely manner is very challenging. We investigated a machine learning approach to find recent studies with high clinical impact to support clinical decision making and literature surveillance.
   Methods: To identify recent studies, we developed our classification model using time-agnostic features that are available as soon as an article is indexed in PubMed (R), such as joumal impact factor, author count, and study sample size. Using a gold standard of 541 high impact treatment studies referenced in 11 disease management guidelines, we tested the following null hypotheses: (1) the high impact classifier with time-agnostic features (HI-TA) performs equivalently to PubMed's Best Match sort and a MeSH-based Naive Bayes classifier; and (2) HI-TA performs equivalently to the high impact classifier with both time-agnostic and time-sensitive features (HI-TS) enabled in a previous study. The primary outcome for both hypotheses was mean top 20 precision.
   Results: The differences in mean top 20 precision between HI-TA and three baselines (PubMed's Best Match, a MeSH-based Naive Bayes classifier, and HI-TS) were not statistically significant (12% vs. 3%, p = 0.101; 12% vs. 11%, p = 0.720; 12% vs. 25%, p = 0.094, respectively). Recall of HI-TA was low (7%).
   Conclusion: HI-TA had equivalent performance to state-of-the-art approaches that depend on time-sensitive features. With the advantage of relying only on time-agnostic features, the proposed approach can be used as an adjunct to help clinicians identify recent high impact clinical studies to support clinical decision-making. However, low recall limits the use of HI-TA for literature surveillance.

AB Hospital traditional cost accounting systems have inherent limitations that restrict their usefulness for measuring the exact cost of healthcare services. In this regard, new approaches such as Time Driven-Activity based Costing (TDABC) provide appropriate information on the activities needed to provide a quality service. However, TDABC is not flawless. This system is designed for conditions of relatively accurate information that can accurately estimate the cost of services provided to patients. In this study, the fuzzy logic in the TDABC model is used to resolve the inherent ambiguity and uncertainty and determine the best possible values for cost, capacity, and time parameters to provide accurate information on the costs of the healthcare services. This approach has not yet been tested and used in determining the costs of services of a healthcare setting. Therefore, the aim of this study is to present a new Fuzzy Logic-TDABC (FL-TDABC) model for estimating healthcare service costs based on uncertainty conditions in hospitals. The proposed model is implemented in a sample of the hospital laboratory section and the results are compared with the TDABC system. The TDABC model, by allocating the activity costs including fixed costs and not considering the uncertainty regarding the cost, capacity, and time required for each patient, often estimates the unused capacity and costs with a higher margin of error. The results show that the maximum difference in the prescribed costs was 4.75%, 3.72%, and 2.85% in blood bank, microbiology, and hematology tests, respectively, mostly due to uncertainty in the costs of consumables, equipment and manpower (on average 4.54%, 3.8%, and 3.59%, respectively). Also, The TDABC system, in comparison with the proposed system, estimates the unused capacity of the resource with more error. Cost of unused capacity derived using FL-TDABC were 80% of costs derived using TDABC. In conditions where the information is ambiguous, using the new system in hospitals can lead to a more accurate estimate of the cost compared to the TDABC system. Moreover, it helps hospital managers to make appropriate decisions about the use of capacity, capital budgeting, cost control, and etc.

AB Smartphone and smartwatch technology is changing the transmission and monitoring landscape for patients and research participants to communicate their healthcare information in real-time. Flexible, bidirectional and realtime control of communication allows development of a rich set of healthcare applications that can provide interactivity with the participant and adapt dynamically to their changing environment. Additionally, smart watches have a variety of sensors suitable for collecting physical activity and location data. The combination of all these features makes it possible to transmit the collected data to a remote server, and thus, to monitor physical activity and potentially social activity in real time. As smartwatches exhibit high user acceptability and increasing popularity, they are ideal devices for monitoring activities for extended periods of time to investigate the physical activity patterns in free-living condition and their relationship with the seemingly random occurring illnesses, which have remained a challenge in the current literature. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to develop a smartwatch-based framework for real-time and online assessment and mobility monitoring (ROAMM). The proposed ROAMM framework will include a smartwatch application and server. The smartwatch application will be used to collect and preprocess data. The server will be used to store and retrieve data, remote monitor, and for other administrative purposes. With the integration of sensor-based and user-reported data collection, the ROAMM framework allows for data visualization and summary statistics in real-time.

AB One of the most important issues in predictive modeling is to determine major cause factors of a phenomenon and causal relationships between them. Extracting causal relationships between parameters in a natural phenomenon can be accomplished through checking the parameters' changes in consecutive events. In addition, using information and probabilistic theory help better conception of causal relationships of a phenomenon. Therefore, probabilistic causal discovery from sequential data of a natural phenomenon can be useful for dimension reduction and predicting the future trend of a process. In this paper, we introduce a novel method for causal discovery from a sequential data based on a probabilistic causal graph. In this method, first, Causal Feature Dependency matrix (CFD matrix) is generated based on the features' changes in consecutive events. Then, a probabilistic causal graph is created from CFD matrix. In this graph, some valueless features will be eliminated on the basis of entropy value of each conditional density function. Finally, prediction operation is performed based on the output of causal graph. Experimental results on the Pooled Resource Open-Access ALS Clinical Trials (PRO-ACT) sequential data set from Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) disease show that our proposed algorithm can predict the progression rate of ALS disease properly with high precision.

AB Accurate and reliable prediction of clinical progression over time has the potential to improve the outcomes of chronic disease. The classical approach to analyzing longitudinal data is to use (generalized) linear mixed-effect models (GLMM). However, linear parametric models are predicated on assumptions, which are often difficult to verify. In contrast, data-driven machine learning methods can be applied to derive insight from the raw data without a priori assumptions. However, the underlying theory of most machine learning algorithms assume that the data is independent and identically distributed, making them inefficient for longitudinal supervised learning. In this study, we formulate an analytic framework, which integrates the random-effects structure of GLMM into non-linear machine learning models capable of exploiting temporal heterogeneous effects, sparse and varying-length patient characteristics inherent in longitudinal data. We applied the derived mixed-effect machine learning (MEmI) framework to predict longitudinal change in glycemic control measured by hemoglobin Alc (HbAlc) among well controlled adults with type 2 diabetes. Results show that MEml is competitive with traditional GLMM, but substantially outperformed standard machine learning models that do not account for random-effects. Specifically, the accuracy of MEmI in predicting glycemic change at the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th clinical visits in advanced was 1.04, 1.08, 1.11, and 1.14 times that of the gradient boosted model respectively, with similar results for the other methods. To further demonstrate the general applicability of MEmI, a series of experiments were performed using real publicly available and synthetic data sets for accuracy and robustness. These experiments reinforced the superiority of MEmI over the other methods. Overall, results from this study highlight the importance of modeling random-effects in machine learning approaches based on longitudinal data. Our MEmI method is highly resistant to correlated data, readily accounts for random-effects, and predicts change of a longitudinal clinical outcome in real-world clinical settings with high accuracy.

AB Objective: To contribute the design, development, and assessment of a new concept: Micro ad hoc Health Social Networks (uHSN), to create a social-based solution for supporting patients with chronic disease.
   Design: After in-depth fieldwork and intensive co-design over a 4-year project following Community-Based Participatory Research (CBPR), this paper contributes a new paradigm of uHSN, defining two interaction areas (the "backstage", the sphere invisible to the final user, where processes that build services take place; and the "onstage", the visible part that includes the patients and relatives), and describes a new transversal concept, i.e., "network spaces segments," to provide timely interaction among all involved profiles and guaranteeing qualitative relationships. This proposal is applicable to any service design project and to all types of work areas; in the present work, it served as a social-based solution for supporting patients with chronic disease in two real-life health scenarios: a Parkinson disease patient association and a Stroke rehabilitation service in a hospital. These two scenarios included the following main features: thematic (related to the specific disease), private, and secure (only for the patient, relatives, healthcare professional, therapist, carer), with defined specific objectives (around patient support), small size (from tens to hundreds of users), ability to integrate innovative services (e.g., connection to hospital information service or to health sensors), supported by local therapeutic associations, and clustered with preconfigured relationships among users based in network groups.
   Measurements: Using a mixed qualitative and quantitative approach for 6 months, the performance of the uHSN was assessed in the two environments: a hospital rehabilitation unit working with Stroke patients, and a Parkinson disease association providing physiotherapy, occupational therapy, psychological support, speech therapy, and social services. We describe the proposed methods for evaluating the uHSN quantitatively and qualitatively, and how the scientific community can replicate and/or integrate this contribution in its research.
   Results: The uHSN overcomes the main limitations of traditional HSNs in the main areas recommended in the literature: privacy, security, transparency, system ecology, Quality of Service (QoS), and technology enhancement. The qualitative and quantitative research demonstrated its viability and replicability in four key points: user acceptance, productivity improvement, QoS enhancement, and fostering of social relations. It also meets the expectation of connecting health and social worlds, supporting distance rehabilitation, improving professionals' efficiency, expanding users' social capital, improving information quality and immediacy, and enhancing perceived peer/social/emotional support. The scientific contributions of the present paper are the first step not only in customizing health solutions that empower patients, their families, and healthcare professionals, but also in transferring this new paradigm to other scientific, professional, and social environments to create new opportunities.

To be effective, this type of rehabilitation should follow three main rules. First, rehabilitation exercises should be able to keep patient's motivation high. Second, each exercise should be customizable depending on patient's needs. Third, patient's performance should be evaluated objectively, i.e., by measuring patient's movements with respect to an optimal reference model. To meet the just reported requirements, in this paper, an interactive and low-cost full body rehabilitation framework for the generation of 3D immersive serious games is proposed. The framework combines two Natural User Interfaces (NUIs), for hand and body modeling, respectively, and a Head Mounted Display (HMD) to provide the patient with an interactive and highly defined Virtual Environment (VE) for playing with stimulating rehabilitation exercises. The paper presents the overall architecture of the framework, including the environment for the generation of the pilot serious games and the main features of the used hand and body models. The effectiveness of the proposed system is shown on a group of ninety-two patients. In a first stage, a pool of seven rehabilitation therapists has evaluated the results of the patients on the basis of three reference rehabilitation exercises, confirming a significant gradual recovery of the patients' skills. Moreover, the feedbacks received by the therapists and patients, who have used the system, have pointed out remarkable results in terms of motivation, usability, and customization. In a second stage, by comparing the current state-of-the-art in rehabilitation area with the proposed system, we have observed that the latter can be considered a concrete contribution in terms of versatility, immersivity, and novelty. In a final stage, by training a Gated Recurrent Unit Recurrent Neural Network (GRU-RNN) with healthy subjects (i.e., baseline), we have also provided a reference model to objectively evaluate the degree of the patients' performance. To estimate the effectiveness of this last aspect of the proposed approach, we have used the NTU RGB D Action Recognition dataset obtaining comparable results with the current literature in action recognition.

AB Scientific knowledge constitutes a complex system that has recently been the topic of in-depth analysis. Empirical evidence reveals that little is known about the dynamic aspects of human knowledge. Precise dissection of the expansion of scientific knowledge could help us to better understand the evolutionary dynamics of science. In this paper, we analyzed the dynamic properties and growth principles of the MEDLINE bibliographic database using network analysis methodology. The basic assumption of this work is that the scientific evolution of the life sciences can be represented as a list of co-occurrences of MeSH descriptors that are linked to MEDLINE citations. The MEDLINE database was summarized as a complex system, consisting of nodes and edges, where the nodes refer to knowledge concepts and the edges symbolize corresponding relations. We performed an extensive statistical evaluation based on more than 25 million citations in the MEDLINE database, from 1966 until 2014. We based our analysis on node and community level in order to track temporal evolution in the network. The degree distribution of the network follows a stretched exponential distribution which prevents the creation of large hubs. Results showed that the appearance of new MeSH terms does not also imply new connections. The majority of new connections among nodes results from old MeSH descriptors. We suggest a wiring mechanism based on the theory of structural holes, according to which a novel scientific discovery is established when a connection is built among two or more previously disconnected parts of scientific knowledge. Overall, we extracted 142 different evolving communities. It is evident that new communities are constantly born, live for some time, and then die. We also provide a Web-based application that helps characterize and understand the content of extracted communities. This study clearly shows that the evolution of MEDLINE knowledge correlates with the network's structural and temporal characteristics.

AB Sentiment analysis may offer insights into patient outcomes through the subjective expressions made by clinicians in the text of encounter notes. We analyzed the predictive, concurrent, convergent, and content validity of six sentiment methods in a sample of 793,725 multidisciplinary clinical notes among 41,283 hospitalizations associated with an intensive care unit stay. None of these approaches improved early prediction of in-hospital mortality using logistic regression models, but did improve both discrimination and calibration when using random forests. Additionally, positive sentiment measured by the CoreNLP (OR 0.04, 95% CI 0.002-0.55), Pattern (OR 0.09, 95% CI 0.04-0.17), sentimentr (OR 0.37, 95% CI 0.25-0.63), and Opinion (OR 0.25, 95% CI 0.07-0.89) methods were inversely associated with death on the concurrent day after adjustment for demographic characteristics and illness severity. Median daily lexical coverage ranged from 5.4% to 20.1%. While sentiment between all methods was positively correlated, their agreement was weak. Sentiment analysis holds promise for clinical applications but will require a novel domain-specific method applicable to clinical text.

AB Microarrays are still one of the major techniques employed to study cancer biology. However, the identification of expression patterns from microarray datasets is still a significant challenge to overcome. In this work, a new approach using Neuroevolution, a machine learning field that combines neural networks and evolutionary computation, provides aid in this challenge by simultaneously classifying microarray data and selecting the subset of more relevant genes. The main algorithm, FS-NEAT, was adapted by the addition of new structural operators designed for this high dimensional data. In addition, a rigorous filtering and preprocessing protocol was employed to select quality microarray datasets for the proposed method, selecting 13 datasets from three different cancer types. The results show that Neuroevolution was able to successfully classify microarray samples when compared with other methods in the literature, while also finding subsets of genes that can be generalized for other algorithms and carry relevant biological information. This approach detected 177 genes, and 82 were validated as already being associated to their respective cancer types and 44 were associated to other types of cancer, becoming potential targets to be explored as cancer biomarkers. Five long non-coding RNAs were also detected, from which four don't have described functions yet. The expression patterns found are intrinsically related to extracellular matrix, exosomes and cell proliferation. The results obtained in this work could aid in unraveling the molecular mechanisms underlying the tumoral process and describe new potential targets to be explored in future works.

AB This study aimed to estimate the effect of gastrointestinal nematodes (GIN) on the productive performance assessed by the live-weight change (LWC) of lambs, and the metabolic cost associated with parasitism by means of a meta-analysis. Data used in the meta-analyses were obtained from twenty papers selected using the following criteria: (a) lambs with (I) and without (NI) GIN; (b) lambs fed ad libitum; (c) LWC data; (d) feed consumption data; and (e) chemical composition of diets. The effect of diet composition (crude protein [CP] and metabolizable energy [ME]) on dry matter intake (DMI), and the effect of composition and nutrient intake (DMI and CP intake [CPI]) and ME intake (MEI) on LWC was evaluated using respective regression analyses. The metabolic cost of worm burden was determined as the difference in CP and ME requirements between NI and I lambs for each adult parasite. The CP and ME cost were evaluated for lambs at two different levels: maintenance level 0 g LWC and 100 g LWC. The worm burden had an impact on the DMI and LWC of lambs (P < 0.05). The association of CP x infection level was the best predictor of DMI. The association between MEI and infection level were the best predictors of LWC. The metabolic cost of GIN increased to 0.30 mg CP/kg LW0.75 and 0.0056 kJ ME/kg LW0.75 for each adult parasite. The metabolic cost was not modified by diet quality (maintenance level 0 g LW/day or 100 g LW/day). In conclusion, GIN has a negative effect on DMI and LWC. The metabolic cost of GIN infection can be covered by supplying the additional requirements for protein and energy in the diet of infected lambs.

AB The control of parasitic infections is particularly challenging in environments that are conducive to the maintenance of parasite lifecycles, such as the greyhound kennel, where the long-term breeding and rearing of dogs is common. The prevalence of gastrointestinal (GI) parasites within the Australian greyhound population has never previously been assessed, which seriously constrains the implementation of effective control measures. The aims of this study were to determine the prevalence and risk factors for GI parasites in Australian greyhounds, identify parasites which may be detrimental to the health and performance of dogs, and evaluate the likelihood of zoonotic transmission to kennel staff. Faecal samples were collected from 721 individual greyhounds situated in kennels across five states of Australia; Western Australia, Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria and Tasmania. Animal husbandry and current parasite control protocols were obtained from each kennel and analysed in conjunction with the detected level of parasitism. Overall parasite prevalence was approximately 60%, ranging from 50 to 70% between states. Eleven parasite genera were identified, with Sarcocystis, hookworm, Giardia and Toxocara detected most frequently. Generalised linear mixed model analyses found the major risk factors associated with parasitism were: a) the type of substrate which dogs were housed; b) age of dogs; and c) geographic region. Parasitism was associated most frequently with young dogs housed on grass/sand substrates, which allowed parasite lifecycles to continue, with constant reinfection the likely outcome. Routine treatment with broad-spectrum anthelmintics did not provide effective control in these environments and the adoption of alternate parasite control strategies is recommended. A substantial risk from zoonotic parasites was also identified, with six of the eleven parasite genera detected considered to be zoonotic and a poor understanding of zoonotic transmission among kennel managers.

AB Parasitic nematodes continue to cause significant economic losses in livestock globally. Given the limited number of anthelmintic drugs on the market and the currently increasing drug resistance, there is an urgent need for novel anthelmintics. Most motility assays of anthelmintic activity for parasitic nematodes are laborious and low throughput, and therefore not suitable for screening large compound libraries. Cooperia oncophora accounts for a large proportion of reports on the drug-resistance development of parasites globally. Therefore, using a WMicroTracker instrument, we established a practical, automated and low-cost whole-organism motility assay against exsheathed L3 stages (xL3s) of the ruminant parasite Cooperia oncophora, and screened a repurposing library comprising 2745 molecules. Fourteen known anthelmintics contained in this library were picked up in this blind screen, as well as four novel hits: thonzonium bromide, NH125, physostigmine sulfate, and EVP4593. The four hits were also active against xL3s of Ostertagia ostertagi, Haemonchus contortus and Teladorsagia circumcincta using the same assay. Cytotoxicity testing showed that thonzonium bromide and NH125 (1-Benzyl-3-cetyl-2-methylimidazolium iodide) have significant cytotoxicity. EVP4593 (N(4)-(2-(4-phenoxyphenyl)ethyl)-4,6-quinazolinediamine) demonstrated a potent and broad anthelmintic activity, and a high selectivity index. Moreover, given its novel and unexplored chemical scaffold for anthelmintic activity, EVP4593 is an interesting anthelmintic hit for further optimization.

AB Pharmacological options to treat canine babesiosis caused by Babesia gibsoni, are limited. To address this challenge, screening for novel drug candidates and drug targets against B. gibsoni is urgently needed. In this study, we explored the inhibitory effects of two phytohormone inhibitors, fluridone (FLU) and inabenfide (INA), against B. gibsoni in vitro. The half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) values of FLU and INA against B. gibsoni were 60.6 +/- 3.4 and 4.3 +/- 0.3 mu M, respectively. Parasitemia and viability at 24, 48, and 72 h after FLU and INA treatments were significantly lower than those in the control group. The cytotoxicity of FLU and INA was evaluated using the dog-derived Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cell line; both FLU and INA were less toxic to the MDCK cells than to the control cells. The selectivity index of FLU and INA were higher than 16.5 and 232.6, respectively. In summary, the present study demonstrated that FLU and INA were effective against B. gibsoni infection in vitro and that these compounds might have potential as candidate drugs for the treatment of B. gibsoni.

AB Haemonchus contortus are gastrointestinal nematodes of the family Trichostrongylidae that naturally infect small ruminants while grazing, posing a risk to both animal health and farm profitability. Current diagnostics depend on exacting lab techniques, including manual egg counts and larval differentiation, all of which require time, effort, and specialized technicians. The goal of this study was to facilitate and accelerate the identification and quantification of H. contortus in fecal samples through the use of fluorescein-isothiocyanate peanut-agglutinin staining in order to allow automated detection using a 96-well microplate reader. Next, the model was to be validated using samples containing unknown quantities of eggs. Automated analysis of fluorescence emission of known quantities of H. contortus eggs confirmed an almost perfect linear correlation (r = 0.9984, p < 0.0001), indicating that this new approach can satisfactorily be used to quantify H. contortus eggs on a comparative fluorescence scale. As validation, clinical samples containing an unknown quantity of H. contortus eggs were then analyzed by comparing two methods: either Wisconsin Sugar Flotation (WSF) and McMaster counting followed by manual fluorescence microscopy, or WSF coupled with automated microplate reading. Pearson analysis revealed highly significant correlation between manual and automated methods (r = 0.9999, p < 0.0001), while Bland-Altman plots demonstrated excellent agreement between the two (bias = -0.817 +/- 9.94 with 95% limits of agreement from -20.31 to 18.67). Overall, these results demonstrate that high-throughput screening fluorescence detection and quantification of H. contortus eggs is both accurate and rapid.

AB Neospora caninum is a parasite of veterinary and economic importance, affecting beef and dairy cattle industries globally. While this species has been recognised as a serious cause of disease in cattle and dogs for over 30 years, treatment and control options are still not available. Furthermore, whilst vaccination was identified as the most economic control strategy, vaccine discovery programs require new leads to investigate as vaccines.
   The current lack of gene annotation available for N. caninum, especially compared to the closely related model organism, Toxoplasma gondii, considerably hinders vaccine related research. Moreover, due to the high degree of similarity between the two organisms, a significant amount of gene annotation available for N. caninum stems from sequence homology between the species. However, there is a plethora of literature identifying conserved virulence factors between members of the Apicomplexa, which suggests that key players are contributing to successful parasite invasion, motility, and host cell attachment.
   In this study, bioinformatic approaches classified 125 uncharacterised proteins within the N. caninum genome, as transmembrane proteins with signal peptide sequences. Functional annotation assigned enriched gene ontologies for cell-adhesion, ATP binding, protein serine/threonine phosphatase complex, immune system process, antigen binding, and proteolysis. Additionally, 32 of these proteins were also identified as adhesins, or having adhesin-like properties, which were further characterised through the discovery of domains and gene ontology, to reveal their potential functional significance as virulence factors for N. caninum. This study identifies a new, small subset of proteins within N. caninum, that may be involved in host-cell interaction, parasite adhesion, and invasion, thereby implicating them as potential targets to exploit in the development of control options against the disease.

AB Using in vitro procedures to prepare newly excysted metacercariae and gut-penetrated juvenile Fasciola gigantica, the ultrastructural features of the tegumental syncytium and perikarya of these ephemeral stages in the host-invasion process were compared. The T0-type tegumental cells in newly excysted metacercariae are packed with stored T0 granules which, following transport to the surface membrane of the syncytium, discharge by exocytosis to maintain the glycocalyx. The T0 cells become depleted of T0 granules during the penetration process, shrink in size, and initiate autophagy in the cytoplasm to facilitate metamorphosis from a storage function to active biosynthesis. The novel products appear to include lysosomes which contribute to the autophagosomes, and T1 granules, necessary for maintenance of the glycocalyx and immunoprotection, as the invasion process continues into the host liver. Residual bodies, the end-products of autophagy, are eliminated from the apical membrane of the tegumental syncytium into the host-parasite interface. There they may present a transient source of parasite-derived molecules, including lysosomal cathepsin-type proteases, with potential for interaction with the host's immune system, and so might be exploited as targets for vaccinal and immunomodulatory studies.

AB Benzimidazoles have been intensively (for over 40 years) used in the livestock sector, particularly in small ruminants. This has been led to the widespread emergence of resistance in a number of small ruminant parasite species, especially Haemonchus contortus. In many countries benzimidazole resistance has severely compromised the control of H. contortus in small ruminants; but there is a little information on benzimidazole resistance in H. contortus infecting buffalo and cattle. Resistance to benzimidazoles have also been reported in the large ruminant parasite, Haemonchus placei, but again there is relatively little information on its prevalence. Hence it is very important to understand how resistance-conferring mutations emerge and spread in both parasites in buffalo and cattle hosts in order to develop approaches for the recognition of the problem at an early stage of its development. The present study suggests that the F200Y (TAC) mutation is common in H. contortus, being detected in 5/7 populations at frequencies between 7 and 57%. Furthermore, 6/10 H. placei populations contained the F200Y (TAC) mutation, albeit at low frequencies of between 0.4 and 5%. The phylogenetic analysis suggests that the F200Y (TAC) mutation in H. contortus has emerged on multiple occasions in the region, with at least three independent emergences across the populations. In contrast, the F200Y (TAC) resistance-conferring mutation in H. placei is only seen on a single haplotype. A high level frequency of the resistance haplotypes in the region, suggests that the unique resistance conferring-mutation has spread from a single emergence; likely by anthropogenic animal movement. Overall, these results provide the first clear genetic evidence for the spread of benzimidazole resistance-conferring mutations to multiple different locations from a single emergence in H. placei; while being consistent with previous small ruminant-based observations of multiple emergence of resistance mutations in H. contortus.

AB The objective of the present study was to study, under field conditions, potential associations between gastro-intestinal nematode parasitism and subclinical mastitis in ewes during the lactation period. Faecal and milk samples were collected from 240 ewes in 16 farms, for parasitological and bacteriological plus cytological examination, respectively. In the population sampled, prevalence of gastrointestinal nematode infection was 63.0%; mean faecal count was 357.7 +/- 32.4 eggs per gram (epg); Teladorsagia spp. larvae were identified more frequently in coprocultures (median proportion among farms: 53.0%). The prevalence of subclinical mastitis was 22.6%; coagulase-negative Staphylococcus spp. were identified more frequently as causal agents (64.7% of isolates recovered from cases of the disease). There was clear evidence that the prevalence of subclinical mastitis was higher among ewes with gastrointestinal nematode infection than among ewes without: 26.4% and 16.1% (P = 0.047), respectively. Further, the prevalence of subclinical mastitis was higher in ewes with high faecal epg: 31.1% versus 18.6% in ewes with low faecal epg (P = 0.027). Mean epg counts in ewes with mastitis were significantly higher: 500 +/- 84 (mean +/- standard error of the mean), than epg counts in healthy ewes: 316 +/- 36 (P = 0.024). The findings further underline the importance of concurrent parasitic and bacterial infections. Moreover, results also suggest further factors that can play a role in development of mastitis in ewes.

AB Tropical theileriosis is a tick-borne haemoparasitic disease of cattle caused by the protozoan parasite Theileria annulata. Globally, the economic impact of the disease is immense and enhanced control measures would improve livestock production in endemic regions. Immunisation with a live attenuated vaccine is an effective and widely used control method, however, the repeated use of live vaccines may have an impact on the field parasite population at a genetic level. Additionally, there has been an increasing number of reports of vaccine break-through cases in recent years. Thus, the present study was designed to evaluate the genetic composition of a parasite population over a disease season in a locality where live cell line vaccination is practised. A diverse range of parasite genotypes was identified and every T. annulata positive cattle blood sample harboured multiple parasite genotypes. An alteration in the major genotype and an increasing multiplicity of infection in individual animals was observed over the course of the disease season. Vaccination status was found not to effect within-host multiplicity of infection, while a significantly higher number of genotypes was detected in grazed cattle compared to non-grazed ones. A degree of genetic isolation was evident between parasite populations on a micro-geographic scale, which has not been reported previously for T. annulata. Analysis of parasite genotypes in vaccinated animals suggested only a transient effect of the vaccine genotype on the genetic diversity of the T. annulata population. The vaccine genotype was not detected among clones of two vaccine 'breakthrough' isolates and there is no suggestion that it was responsible for disease. The obtained data indicated that in the system studied there is no apparent risk of introducing the vaccine genotype into the population with only a transient effect on the genetic diversity of the parasite population during the disease season.

AB Ichthyophthirius multifiliis is a ciliate parasite of freshwater fish with a global distribution and results in severe economic losses in aquaculture. The present study aimed to investigate the efficacy and antiparasitic mechanism of active compounds isolated from Zingiber officinale against I. multifiliis. Three compounds were isolated from the Z. officinale extract and identified as 10-gingerol, 6-dehydroshogaol, and 6-dehydro-10-gingerol. 10-gingerol demonstrated the greatest antiparasitic efficacy in vitro. 10-gingerol resulted in 100% mortalities of theronts, nonencysted tomonts, and encysted tomonts at concentrations of 2, 8, and 16 mg/L, respectively. 10-gingerol significantly reduced theronts infectivity (p < 0.05) at a concentration of 1 mg/L, and it was effective in treating infected grass carp and protecting naive fish from I. multifiliis infestation at a concentration of 4 mg/L. The antiparasitic mechanism might be attributed to the increase of intracellular osmotic pressure, accumulation of free radicals, and membrane damage of I. multifiliis post 10-gingerol treatment. The study demonstrated that 10-gingerol had the potential as a therapeutic agent against I. multifiliis.

ID LARVAL MIGRATION; INFECTIONS; SWINE; PERFORMANCE; DISEASES
AB During their migration through the pig's body, Ascaris suum larvae cause significant damage to the lungs. Little is known about the actual impact of this tissue damage on the occurrence and severity of respiratory problems in industrial pig fattening farms. In this study, we evaluated the link between the serological response to two different A. suum antigen preparations and respiratory or meat inspection outcomes. Two different serological tests were used that measure antibodies against either the A. suum haemoglobin molecule or complete homogenate of the 3rd stage larva that migrate through the lungs. Firstly, serum samples were analysed that were collected from 19 herds in which the cause of acute clinical respiratory symptoms was either Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae, A. suum, or a miscellaneous cause. This was done to test whether serological results could confirm pathological findings. Secondly, serum samples from 60 herds of finishing pigs with a history of high or low frequency of pleuritis at meat inspection (MI), but without acute respiratory symptoms at the time of sampling, were also submitted for serological evaluation using both tests. Regression models were used to search for potential associations between the proportion of pigs testing seropositive with MI results, in particular pathological changes related to the lungs. The results of both ELISAs were strongly associated (P < 0.001) with pigs belonging to a herd where the respiratory problems could be attributed to A. swim by histology, indicating that both tests can be used to diagnose clinical respiratory outbreaks due to A. suum. In the herds without acute clinical respiratory symptoms, a positive association was found between the proportion of pigs testing seropositive and the percentage of livers rejected due to milk spots and with whole carcass condemnations. No association was found between Ascaris serology and lung pathology (pneumonia and pleuritis) registered at MI, however, challenging the likely involvement of Ascaris in the development of these lesions.

AB This study aimed to assess current worm control practices used by Australian alpaca farmers with an online questionnaire survey. The questionnaire contained questions about farm demography and general husbandry practices, farmers' knowledge about gastrointestinal nematodes (GINs) and their importance, the use of worm control strategies and anthelmintics, and grazing management. A link for the questionnaire survey was sent to all (n = 954) registered members of the Australian Alpaca Association in July 2015. The response rate for the questionnaire was 25% (239/954). The majority of respondents were from small (<= 50 alpacas; 64%, 153/239) followed by medium (50-100 alpacas; 24%, 57/239) and large (>100 alpacas; 12%, 29/239) farms. Findings revealed that the majority of respondents kept Huacaya alpacas to produce high-quality fibre and alpacas were usually kept with other domestic ruminants (e.g. cattle and sheep). Although half of alpaca farmers (114/220) perceived that GINs were an important health problem of alpacas, with Haemonchus spp. being the most common nematode, the majority of them (174/220) used anthelmintics for nematode control. Macrocyclic lactones, a commercial combination of four anthelmintics (abamectin, albendazole, closantel and levamisole) and monepantel were the three most commonly used dewormers by Australian alpaca farmers. Although a significant proportion (166/213) of respondents used a quarantine drench for alpacas, very few respondents were aware of strategic deworming and the issue of anthelmintic resistance. Alpaca farmers mostly used anthelmintics at the dose rate recommended for sheep (47%, 79/167) and cattle (9%, 15/167), though some used 1.5 (31%, 51/167) and 2 (13%, 22/167) times the dose rate recommended for sheep. The majority of small herds used anthelmintics at the dose rate recommended for sheep and cattle while medium and large herds used anthelmintics at 1.5 to 2 times the dose rate recommended for sheep. This study provides invaluable insights into the demography of alpaca farms in Australia, husbandry practices used by alpaca farmers and their knowledge about worms and their control, thereby paving the way for developing guidelines for the control of GINs of alpacas.

AB The metalorganic frameworks (MOFs) with lanthanides ions offer great potential in the optical area because can provide properties of flexibility, low density, low-cost methods of synthesis, and insolubility in water, which give them an advantage over traditional phosphors. In this study, a thenoyltriflouroacetone ligand (TTA) with a Tb3+ MOF was synthesized (Tb = 10 and 50% mol) and its structural and luminescent properties were analyzed. The metalorganic compound was generated in a simple one-pot reaction from terbium nitrate and 2-thenoyltrifluoroacetone precursors at room temperature. By means of FTIR, it was confirmed the presence of carbon groups, which made possible the terbium ion chelation, and also the Tb-O bonds vibration modes. (HNMR)-H-1 results confirm that the complex with 10% mol of Tb3+ contains three coordinates molecules of TTA and two waters molecules. The powders exhibit rod-like morphology with size about 170 rim of diameter and a length about 2 pm; the rod-like nature of powders was confirmed by SEM and TEM analyses. By XRD it was concluded that at higher terbium concentration (TTA-50Th sample) higher the crystallite size and crystallinity, in fact the TTA-10Th sample shows a partial-amorphous nature. By photoluminescence analyses, the D-5(4) -> F-7(J) (J = 3, 4, 5 and 6) emissions were recorded for both synthesized samples (lambda(exc) = 376 nm). Furthermore, it was observed that the emission intensity was enhanced in a factor of 3.5 for the TTA-50Tb. The energy transfer efficiency from TTA to Tb3+ (antenna effect) was 0.984 for TTA-10Tb and 0.993 for TTA-50Tb). Decay time analyses indicate effective lifetime of 1.45 and 1.60 m s for the samples doped at 10 and 50%, respectively, indicating that the forbidden transition rules are stronger at higher crystallinity. The integrated intensities of the D-5(4) -> 7F(5) (green at 541 rim) and D-5(4) -> F-7(6) (blue at 486 nm) emissions and their intensity ratios I-G/I-B upon 376 rim excitation have been evaluated for TTA-10Tb and TTA-50Tb samples. The CIE1931 color of the MOF5 excited at 376 rim attains a higher green color purity by increasing the terbium concentration. This is in concordance with the increased I-G/I-B ratio up for the TTA-10Tb and TTA-50Tb samples. Thus, the TTA-50Tb sample exhibits a green color purity of 67.94% with chromaticity coordinates (0.30, 0.57), being very close to those (0.29, 0.60) of European Broadcasting Union illuminant green. This interesting feature of the TTA-50Th sample, together with an experimental branching ratio of 61.3% for the D-5(4) -> F-7(5) green emission, highlights its capability as solid state green laser pumped by GaN (376 nm) LEDs.

In a tensile test, the maximum strain and stress values in the stress-strain curve of the ALCe:La-GPS single crystal compared to the Ce:La-GPS single crystal and the result suggests that there is a possibility of the improvement on the mechanical property by Al co-doping. In addition, the light yield of the La-GPS single crystal under y-ray irradiation was slightly increased and the decay time was accelerated by the Al co-doping.

AB Here, we present previously synthesized azo and azo-azomethine dyes as thin films in PMMA matrix in order to investigate their spectral and optical properties. The spectral properties of the vapour deposited 100 nm nanosized films of the dyes have been characterized by UV-VIS and Fluorescence spectroscopy to determine the excitation and emission energies of the electron transitions. Photoinduced birefringence was induced in the films by pump lasers with wavelengths 355 nm and 491 nm in the region of the absorbance band of the chromophores used. The kinetics of recording, relaxation and erasure of birefringence were presented. The photochromic behaviour of the chromophore groups in azo dyes (-N = N-) and azo-azomethine dyes (-N = N-and CH = N-) were evaluated as potential light driven reversible optical storage devices. The presence of two photoactive groups in azo-azomethines makes them appropriate candidates for optical photoswitches.

These glasses, prepared by a conventional quenching method, were transparent and non-hygroscopic. The n. spectra showed a green band emission (400-600 nm) arising from 4f(n)-4f(n) forbidden transitions of the Tb3+ ions. A TL glow peak was observed at 360 K in all the glasses at different Tb concentrations. Among them, the 1.0, 2.0, and 4.0 mol% Tb-doped glasses exhibited excellent linearity over the 1.0 mGy-10 Gy irradiation dose range. The TL peak intensity decreased to similar to 60% after 1 h, similar to 45% after 24 h and similar to 30% after 72 h.

AB In this paper, we present a comprehensive analytical model of Tm able to take into account direct cross-relaxation process. We show that by using an appropriate set of parameters the model is able to properly fit the first part of the fluorescence decay of Tm-doped tellurite glasses for different dopant concentration values. We also compare the model with a full numerical model to investigate its limitations. We assess the model is a valid tool to fit fluorescence properties but for precisely predicting population inversion is limited to doping level up to about 1%. In fact, we show the reverse cross-relaxation process becomes significant in case of higher doping level.

AB In this work we summarize the results of our research on design and development of the PMMA-based composites doped with lanthanum aluminum oxide (LaAlO3) nanocrystals activated with selected rare-earth ions dysprosium, holmium, thulium and praseodymium. A set of rare-earth doped nanopowders, differing in activators' concentration was manufactured and carefully characterized with respect of luminescent properties in the visible spectral range. The samples of optimal luminescent features were introduced into PMMA polymer, constituting the luminescent composite materials with the active centers shielded from the parasitic interactions with polymer phonons. These, in turn, were subjected to optical characterization covering luminescence spectra and kinetics measurements, which enabled comparison of the luminescent features and assessment of the quality of developed materials as well as correctness of proposed approach.

AB Using the sol-gel technique a SiO2-PMMA hybrid matrix was synthesized by the simultaneous hydrolysis of tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) and the polymerization of methyl methacrylate (MMA). The hybrid material was doped with terbium ions for it's luminescent properties for applications in thin film devices, sensors and as an active laser media. The optical properties of the material were characterized by UV vis and photoluminescence spectroscopy. Surface morphology of the material properties were observed using atomic force microscopy and the material's composition was studied using Raman spectroscopy. Distribution of the dopant inside matrix was analyzed by confocal microscopy. Measurements indicate that a homogeneous, non-porous composite was obtained with the terbium ions retaining their luminescent properties with good optical transmission across all the visible spectra.

AB SrAl2O4:Eu,Dy is a very efficient long afterglow phosphor with wide range of possible applications. The luminescence properties and the possible luminescence mechanism of this material have been studied extensively, but there is almost no information available about the undoped material. Therefore, this article deals with the luminescence and thermally stimulated luminescence of an undoped SrAl2O4, revealing the possible defects that might be involved in the creation of the long afterglow in doped material. We conclude that undoped material exhibits some luminescence under X-ray irradiation in low temperature; close to room temperatures luminescence is almost fully thermally quenched in comparison to low temperatures. We can observe F and F-2 center luminescence as well as trace metal luminescence in the emission spectrum. TSL glow curve yields the peaks that are close to those observed in material with Eu and Dy doping; therefore these peaks are clearly related to intrinsic defects. The peak at around 400 K, that is shifting with rare earth doping, might be due to dopant interaction with intrinsic defects.

AB We present a study of the feasibility of transforming the multicore fiber in a supermode-interference based bending sensor into an active stage. By compensating the antisymmetric supermode losses for high curvatures, fringe visibility is improved and the sensor operating range can be extended. For a given multicore fibre length and Er3+-ion concentration sensor calibration curves allow assessing the bending radius by measuring the visibility as a function of the input pump power. The Er3+-ion concentration, available input pump power and multicore fiber length set the minimum bending radius that could be measured.

All the crystal samples exhibit photoluminescence and scintillation with a broad emission around 510 nm. The decay time constants of the latter emission are typical for the 5d-4f transitions of Eu2+. From the pulse height spectra measured under Cs-137 gamma-ray, the estimated light yields of Eu:SrAl2O4, Eu:Ba0.1Sr0.9Al2O4 Eu:Ba0.3Sr0.7Al2O4, and Eu:Ba0.5Sr0.5Al2O4 crystal samples are 42,000, 30,000, 22,000 and 20,000 photons/MeV, respectively. The observed light yields are notably high, and the fact indicates that Eu:Ba0.5Sr0.5Al2O4 crystals are good candidates of scintillator materials for gamma-ray measurements.

AB Fully amorphous rare earth co-doped barium gallo-germanate glasses were synthesized using the traditional melt quenching-technique. The glass systems were doped with selected pairs of rare earths Dy3+/Ce3+ and Dy3+/Tm3+ ions. To study the spectroscopic properties of gallo-germanate glasses co-doped with Dy3+ and Ln(3+) (Ln = Ce, Tm) ions, the luminescence spectra and luminescence decay curves were recorded. It was observed that luminescence bands corresponding to characteristic transitions of Ln(3+) (Ln = Ce, Tm) and dysprosium ions are present in the emission spectra measured under direct excitation of Ln(3+). The experimental results indicate that energy transfer between dysprosium and cerium/thulium ions is effective. From the emission spectra, the Commission Internationale de I'Eclairage (CIE) chromaticity coordinates (x, y) were calculated in relation to the potential application of gallo-germanate glasses for white LEDs. It has been proved that our glass systems exhibit white emission originating from the simultaneous generation of several bands of Dy3+, Ce3+/Tm3+ under the UV-visible light excitation.

AB Rare-earth-doped oxide nanoparticles in the core of silica optical fibers are becoming well studied as they yield enhanced and tailorable spectroscopic and optical properties. In this paper, the evolution of particle morphology, induced by the drawing step, is studied. Indeed, during the fiber draw process, the glass flows and particles can elongate and even break-up into smaller particles through Rayleigh-Plateau instabilities. The shape of elongated particles is related to the composition as it depends on the viscosity ratio between the particle and the matrix. Moreover, a lower drawing temperature enhances the break-up phenomenon. These observations offer new possibilities for the control of the size and the shape of particles, hence performance of active optical fibers.

AB A series of Cu+/Eu3+ co-doped borosilicate glasses have been successfully prepared by melt-quenching method. As proved by transmission spectra, the copper ions are univalent in the investigated borosilicate glasses. Under ultraviolet (UV) excitation at 325 nm, the emission intensity of Eu3+ increased by nearly double due to a large overlapping between the Cu+ and Eu3+ emission peaks. The decreased excitation intensity in UV region and shortened emission lifetime of Cu+ in association with presence of Eu3+ ions consistently suggest an energy transfer process from Cu+ to Eu3+ ions. On the other hand, the partially allowed transition of Cu+ makes contribution to the red emission of Eu3+ at 611 nm in Cu+/Eu3+ co-doped samples, thus shortening the lifetime from the conventional millisecond (1.86 ms) to the microsecond (up to around 37 us) regime. Besides, tunable light is realized by combining the blue-green emission from Cu+ ions with the orange-red one from Eu3+ ions. The light can be continuously tuned by changing the Cu+/Eu3+ concentration ratio, indicating that the present novel Cu+/Eu3+ co-doped borosilicate glasses are potential as fast response and tunable photoluminescence materials.

AB Ce-doped MgO-CaO-SiO2 ceramics show notable storage luminescence properties as thermally-stimulated luminescence (TSL) and optically-stimulated luminescence (OSL). The origin of luminescence for both TSL and OSL is due to the 5d -> 4f transitions of Ce3+. The TSL glow curve consists of four peaks at 98, 196, 318, and 450 degrees C when heated at a rate of 1 degrees C/s. The activation energies derived by the initial rise method are 0.84, 1.08, 1.36, and 1.36 eV, respectively. OSL decay curve also consists of four components with decay time constants (and relative intensities) of 1.3 s (57.6%), 7.0 s (30.5%), 30.9 s (9.8%), and 181.3 s (2.1%). The TSL-active centre is accessible by optical exposure while the OSL centre can be activated by heat. However, these centres may not be in a direct relationship.

AB We investigate the modal properties (effective index and modal gain) of an active, Erbium-doped single-mode slab waveguide made of silica tin-dioxide glass-ceramics on Silica. Completed with a photo-inscribed Bragg grating, such a structure is a good candidate for realizing an optically pumped laser emitter. For total Erbium concentration of 9.84 x 10(-4) mol/cm(3) and a cross-section (for stimulated transitions) of sigma approximate to 2 x 10(-25) m(2) in a discussed structure, the maximum achievable material gain in DFB with Quarter-Wave phase Shift (QWS-DFB) is sigma N-tot = 23 m(-1). Taking into account the confinement factor, the maximum achievable modal gain, in complex amplitude, over the length of 10 mm is at about (alpha L-max) approximate to 0.09.

AB GdTaO4 and (Gd1-xTbx)TaO4 (x = 0, 0.001, 0.02, 0.04, 0.10, and 0.16) single crystals were grown by the micro-pulling down method. The crystallographic system of the grown crystals was identified to be monoclinic (I2/a), which is the stable low-temperature phase of GdTaO4. In the photoluminescence (PL) spectra, intense emission was observed at 549 nm (D-5(3)-> F-7(4) transition of Tb3+) for every Tb doped GdTaO4. In the excitation spectra for the 549nm emission, several excitation paths to the Tb3+ were attributed: 4f-4f transitions of Gd3+, 4f(8)-4f(7)5d transitions of Tb3+ and charge transfer of TaO43- group. Radiolumincece spectra under X-ray irradiation were taken, and the highest emission peak was observed at 544 nm, which was ascribed to the D-5(4)-> F-7(5) transition of Tb3+. The Tb 2% doped GdTaO4 showed the highest emission intensity at the 544 nm, and as increasing dopant concentration, the intensity decreased due to the cross-relaxation of Tb3+.

AB In this paper, the investigation of energy transfer efficiency in Tb3+-Yb3+ co-doped SiO2-HfO2 glass and glass ceramic waveguides is presented. Cooperative energy transfer between these two ions allows to cut one UV or 488 nm photon in two 980 nm photons and could have important applications in improving the performance of photovoltaic solar cells. Thin films with different molar concentrations of rare earths, up to a total concentration of 21%, were prepared by a sol-gel route, using dip-coating deposition technique on SiO2 substrates. The ratio between Yb3+ and Tb3+ ions in all the prepared thin films is constant and equal to 4. The energy transfer between Tb3+ and Yb3+ ions in glass and glass-ceramic waveguides shows the higher efficiency for glass ceramic with a maximum quantum transfer efficiency of about 190% for the sample containing 19% of rare earths.

AB All Er3+ doped dielectric 1-D microcavity was fabricated by rf sputtering technique. The microcavity was constituted by half wave Er3+ doped SiO2 active layer inserted between two Bragg reflectors consists of ten pairs of SiO2/TiO2 layers also doped with Er3+ ions. The scanning electron microscopy was used to check the morphology of the structure. Transmission measurements confirm the third and first order cavity resonance at 530 nm and 1560 nm, respectively. The photoluminescence measurements were obtained by optically exciting at the third order cavity resonance using 514.5 nm Ar+ laser with an excitation angle of 30 degrees. The Full Width at Half Maximum of the emission peak at 1560 nm decrease with the pump power until the spectral resolution of the detection system of similar to 1.0 nm. Moreover, the emission intensity presents a non-linear behavior with the pump power and a threshold at about 24 mW was observed with saturation of the signal at above 185 mW of pump power.

AB The article presents energy transfer observed in poly (methyl methacrylate) co-doped by trivalent terbium and europium ions. The measured spectra and terbium luminescence decay changes confirm energy transfer process between used lanthanides. Maximum energy transfer efficiency 29.6% was obtained for molar concentration ratio of Eu (tmhd)(3)/Tb (tmhd)(3) equals to 3.6. Additionally, the co-doped polymer host was used for luminescent polymeric fibre fabrication. The waveguide structure is attractive for investigation of energy transfer, re absorption, and attenuation phenomena observed in polymeric fibre. The luminescent properties vs. fibre length at one end excitation (355 nm) is also investigated in terms of spectrum shape modification.

AB The luminescence properties of Ce3+-doped GdxY3-xAl5-ySiyO12-yNy (x = 0, 1 and 2; y = 0.25) oxynitride garnet phosphors were investigated and compared with corresponding oxide garnet phosphors (y = 0). The measured photoluminescence spectra exhibit redshift of the emission peak wavelength by the partial nitridation of oxide garnet phosphors because of the strong crystal field splitting and the nephelauxetic effect. Temperature dependence studies of the photoluminescence intensity revealed that the quenching temperature decreased by partial nitridation and Gd substitution. The thermal activation energy, estimated from temperature dependence of the fluorescent lifetime, was found to decrease from 0.85 eV (x = 0, y = 0) to 0.27 eV (x = 2, y = 0.25).

AB A promising series of phosphors based on Li7La3Hf2O12:xLn(3+) (Ln = Tb, Dy) has been prepared using a conventional solid state reaction and their luminescence properties have been investigated. The powder X-ray diffraction patterns show that Li-7(La(1-x)Ln(x))(3)Hf2O12 (Ln = Tb, Dy) solid solutions crystallize in the tetragonal space group I4(1)/acd, Z = 8. The photoluminescence spectra of Tb3+ doped Li7La3Hf2O12 contain well-known blue-green emission lines due to the D-5(4) -> F-7(J) (J = 3-6) transitions of Tb3+. At relatively low activator concentrations, the blue emissions from the 5D3 level are observed along with emissions from the D-5(4) level. The intensity ratio between the emission levels of D-5(3) and D-5(4) depends significantly on the terbium content, which makes it possible to obtain a tunable emission from green to yellowish green color. Under UV excitation, the emission spectra of Li7La3Hf2O12:xDy(3+) phosphor exhibit several peaks attributed to the F-4(9/2) -> H-6(J) (J = 11/2, 13/2 and 15/2) transitions with stable CIE chromaticity coordinates (0.417, 0.420) located in the white light region.

AB The photoluminescence (PL) and radiation response properties of CeCl3-doped 2CsPO(3)-Al(PO3)(3) were analyzed. Glasses doped with different concentrations of CeCl3 were prepared according to the conventional melt quenching method under a nitrogen atmosphere. Within the resolution limit of the XRD instrument, the XRD patterns showed a broad band without specific diffraction peaks, indicating the amorphous nature of the glasses. The PL and X-ray-excited radioluminescence spectra showed an ultraviolet fluorescence band at 350 nm due to the 5 d-4f allowed transition of Ce3+. The decay time and light yield were estimated to be about 20 ns and 530 photons/MeV, respectively.

AB In our work we present the energy transfer phenomenon observed in poly(methyl methacrylate) co-doped by Tb (tmhd)(3) and Rhodamine B. The optical properties characterization (recorded luminescence spectra and decay time measurements) indicate efficient energy transfer (up to 67%) between used complexes. Additionally, the developed matrix was used for luminescent polymeric fiber fabrication. The co-doped PMMA fiber allows significant luminescence spectrum modification by using energy transfer and optical radiation reabsorption phenomena. Presented lanthanide-organic dye co-doped poly(methyl methacrylate) fiber can be used for new photonic applications of polymeric optical fibers.

AB We have investigated scintillation and photoluminescence (PL) properties of Sr2CeO4 ceramics. The ceramic samples were synthesized by the solid state reaction method sintered at different temperatures (1100, 1200, 1300 and 1400 degrees C). All the Sr2CeO4 ceramic samples showed PL spectrum with a broad feature peaking around 460 nm. From decay constants of the PL emission, it was confirmed that the origin was due to the charge transfer (CT) transitions of O2-Ce4+ ions. In addition, all the samples showed scintillation induced by X-rays with a spectrum peaking around 500 nm as similarly seen in PL. All of the samples exhibited a clear photoabsorption peak in the pulse height spectra measured under Cs-137 gamma-ray irradiation, and the absolute scintillation light yield (LY) was the highest for the sample sintered at 1200 degrees C, and the value was 3200 ph/MeV.

AB A series of Sr3La2-xEux(Ge3O9)(2) (x = 0.1-1.8) cyclogermanates has been prepared by the citrate method. The powder XRD study has shown that the compounds crystallize in the monoclinic space group C2/c, Z = 4. An increase in the dopant content causes a morphotropic phase transition: at x = 0.1-0.7 the samples are isostructural to Sr3La2(Ge3O9)(2), while at x = 0.9-1.8 the germanates have a crystal structure of Sr3Eu2(Ge3O9)(2). In all compounds, strontium and rare earth ions occupy three symmetry independent cation sites and form layers alternating along the [10 (1) over bar] direction. The relationships between the crystal structure and the luminescence characteristics: the energy of the charge transfer transition, the values of 4f-4f/CTB and D-5(0) -> F-7(2)/D-5(0) -> F-7(1) intensity ratios have been revealed. CIE chromaticity coordinates for Sr3La1.4Eu0.6(Ge3O9)(2) and Sr3La0.8Eu1.2(Ge3O9)(2) phosphors under 393 nm excitation have been measured.

AB Phosphate glasses with the composition (90NaPO(3)center dot(10-x)Na2O-xNaF) (mol%) with x = 0 and 10 were prepared with blue persistent luminescence (PeL) using direct particles doping method. Commercial CaAl2O4:Eu2+,Nd3+ microparticles (MPs) with blue PeL were added in the glass melt at a lower temperature than the melting temperature. The PeL properties of the glasses were related to the diffusion of Al from the MPs to the glass occurring during the glass preparation, which was found to depend on the temperature at which the MPs are added in the melt and also on the time before casting the melt after adding the MPs. The glass with x = 0 can be prepared with homogeneous PeL if the MPs are added at 575 degrees C. This T-doping temperature can be reduced to 550 degrees C by replacing Na2O by NaF in the glass.

We investigate the steady-state and transient PL of Er3+ ions embedded in gallium lanthanum sulphide-oxide glasses with partial substitution of sulfur by oxygen. We develop a technique for direct observation of RT and we show that RT combined with internal reflections leads to uniform spatial distributions of radiation and excited Er3+ ions inside of glass sample.

AB Galactooligosaccharides (GOS) are prebiotic compounds synthesized from lactose using bacterial enzymes and are known to stimulate growth of beneficial bifidobacteria in the human colon. Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron is a prominent human colon commensal bacterial species that hydrolyzes GOS using an extracellular Glycosyl Hydrolase (GH) family GH53 endo-galactanase enzyme (BTGH53), releasing galactose-based products for growth. Here we dissect the molecular basis for GOS activity of this B. thetaiotaomicron GH53 endo-galactanase. Elucidation of its X-ray crystal structure revealed that BTGH53 has a relatively open active site cleft which was not observed with the bacterial enzyme from Bacillus licheniformis (BLGAL). BTGH53 acted on GOS with degree of polymerization <= 3 and therefore more closely resembles activity of fungal GH53 enzymes (e.g. Aspergillus aculeatus AAGAL and Meripileus giganteus MGGAL). Probiotic lactobacilli that lack galactan utilization systems constitute a group of bacteria with relevance for a healthy (infant) gut. The strains tested were unable to use GOS >= DP3. However, they completely consumed GOS in the presence of BTGH53, resulting in clear stimulation of their extent of growth. The extracellular BTGH53 enzyme thus may play an important role in carbohydrate metabolism in complex microbial environments such as the human colon. It also may find application for the development of synergistic synbiotics.

AB Leucine dehydrogenase (LDH, EC 1.4.1.9) is a NAD(+)-dependent oxidoreductase that catalyzes the deamination of branched-chain L-amino acids (BCAAs). LDH of Geobacillus stearothermophilus (GstLDH) is a highly thermostable enzyme that has been applied for the quantification or production of BCAAs. Here the cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of apo and NAD(+)-bound LDH are reported at 3.0 and 3.2 angstrom resolution, respectively. On comparing the structures, the two overall structures are almost identical, but it was observed that the partial conformational change was triggered by the interaction between Ser147 and the nicotinamide moiety of NAD(+) NAD(+) binding also enhanced the strength of oligomerization interfaces formed by the core domains. Such additional interdomain interaction is in good agreement with our experimental results showing that the residual activity of NAD-bound form was approximately three times higher than that of the apo form after incubation at 80 degrees C. In addition, sequence comparison of three structurally known LDHs indicated a set of candidates for site-directed mutagenesis to improve thermostability. Subsequent mutation analysis actually revealed that non-conserved residues, including Ala94, Tyrl27, and the C-terminal region, are crucial for oligomeric thermostability.

AB Preferred particle orientation represents a recurring problem in single-particle cryogenic electron microcopy (cryo-EM). A specimen-independent approach through tilting has been attempted to increase particle orientation coverage, thus minimizing anisotropic three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction. However, focus gradient is a critical issue hindering tilt applications from being a general practice in single-particle cryo-EM. The present study describes a newly developed geometrically optimized approach, goCTF, to reliably determine the global focus gradient. A novel strategy of determining contrast transfer function (CTF) parameters from a sector of the signal preserved power spectrum is applied to increase reliability. Subsequently, per-particle based local focus refinement is conducted in an iterative manner to further improve the defocus accuracy. Novel diagnosis methods using a standard deviation defocus plot and goodness of fit heatmap have also been proposed to evaluate CTF fitting quality prior to 3D refmement. In a benchmark study, goC1P processed a published single particle cryo-EM dataset for influenza hemagglutinin trimer collected at a 40-degree specimen tilt. The resulting 3D reconstruction map was improved from 4.1 angstrom to 3.7 angstrom resolution. The goCTF program is built on the open source code of CTFFIND4, which adopts a consistent user interface for ease of use.

AB We present LAFTER, an algorithm for de-noising single particle reconstructions from cryo-EM.
   Single particle analysis entails the reconstruction of high-resolution volumes from tens of thousands of particle images with low individual signal-to-noise. Imperfections in this process result in substantial variations in the local signal-to-noise ratio within the resulting reconstruction, complicating the interpretation of molecular structure. An effective local de-noising filter could therefore improve interpretability and maximise the amount of useful information obtained from cryo-EM maps.
   LAFTER is a local de-noising algorithm based on a pair of serial real-space filters. It compares independent half-set reconstructions to identify and retain shared features that have power greater than the noise. It is capable of recovering features across a wide range of signal-to-noise ratios, and we demonstrate recovery of the strongest features at Fourier shell correlation (FSC) values as low as 0.144 over a 256(3)-voxel cube. A fast and computationally efficient implementation of LAFTER is freely available.
   We also propose a new way to evaluate the effectiveness of real-space filters for noise suppression, based on the correspondence between two FSC curves: 1) the FSC between the filtered and unfiltered volumes, and 2) C-ref, the FSC between the unfiltered volume and a hypothetical noiseless volume, which can readily be estimated from the FSC between two half-set reconstructions.

AB The total calcium (tCa) in blood serum comprises free Ca2+ ions (fCa), protein-bound calcium (prCa), and complexed calcium by small anions (cCa). The cCa fraction, in addition to fCa, has been indicated to have some physiological activity. However, there is little evidence for the structure of its constituents. Here we report an ex vivo detection of the cCa constituents by synchrotron X-ray absorption near-edge structure spectroscopy. We collected the data directly on rat blood serum and, by making use of the reference samples, derived a spectrum that exhibits the features of cCa constituents. Among the features are those of the complexes of calcium phosphate and calcium carbonate. The detected complexes in the cCa fraction are mainly Ca(eta(2)-HPO4)(H2O)(4) and Ca (eta(1)-HCO3)(H2O)(5)(+), in which HPO42- and HCO3- serve as bidentate and unidentate ligands, respectively. The remained H2O molecules on the coordination sphere of Ca2+ enable these complexes to behave partially like aquated Ca2+ ions in protein-binding. Besides, as the dominant part of prCa, albumin-bound calcium (albCa) exhibits a spectrum that closely resembles that of fCa, indicating weak interactions between the protein carboxyl groups and calcium. The weak-bound cCa and albCa, along with fCa and the relevant anions, compose a local chemical system that could play a role in maintaining the calcium level in blood.

AB The nature and periodicity of incremental markings in pig enamel is currently debated. To broaden the basis for a correct interpretation of growth marks in pig enamel, we analyzed their periodicity in teeth of wild boars and domestic pigs. For that, the numbers of enamel incremental markings were recorded in ground sections and compared with crown formation times for the respective teeth derived from literature data on tooth development and eruption in Sus scrofa. Our study revealed that laminations with a daily periodicity are the dominant incremental feature of pig enamel. In wild boar M(3)s, daily enamel secretion (apposition) rates ranged between a minimum of 6.1 mu m in the inner and a maximum of 30.6 mu m in the outer enamel.
   Long-period (supra-daily) incremental markings were present as perikymata at the outer enamel surface (OES). Contrary to the situation in primate enamel, in pig enamel the long-period incremental lines terminating in perikyma grooves were mostly structurally indistinguishable from the daily laminations. Typically, five sub daily increments were present between successive laminations. The incremental pattern in pig enamel can be misinterpreted if the laminations are mistaken for long-period markings (striae of Retzius) and the sub-daily growth marks for daily prism cross-striations. The findings of the present study demonstrate the critical importance of correctly characterizing the incremental markings and their periodicity in enamel, and caution against an uncritical transfer of the interpretation of the nature of incremental markings in primate enamel to other mammalian taxa.

AB Human scalp hairs are often examined microscopically to study the variation and diversity among a range of visible morphological traits. In this study, we focused on the ultrastructure of human scalp hair within its keratinized matrix, emphasizing, the density and distribution of melanosomes, variation in cuticle thickness within populations, and the relationship of hair fiber ultrastructure with biogeographic ancestry. We used transmission electron microscopy (TEM) to visualize hair cross-sections and generate micron-scale resolution images for analysis of particle morphology and the layered hair matrix. Our results revealed considerable variation in all parameters examined, including the relationship of ultrastructure to biogeographic ancestry. Among the three metapopulations studied (European, African, and East Asian), we identified hair cross-sectional shape, cuticle dimensions, and melanosome distribution as traits that reveal statistically significant ancestry-related patterns. This study establishes trait patterns in hair morphology and ultrastructure among three biogeographically defined metapopulations to improve the current understanding of human variation in hair form and establish a foundation for future studies on the genetic and developmental bases of phenotypic variation in hair ultrastructure related to genotype.

AB 5-Methylthioribose 1-phosphate isomerase (M1Pi) is a crucial enzyme involved in the universally conserved methionine salvage pathway (MSP) where it is known to catalyze the conversion of 5-methylthioribose 1-phosphate (MTR-1-P) to 5-methylthioribulose 1-phosphate (MTRu-1-P) via a mechanism which remains unspecified till date. Furthermore, although M1Pi has a discrete function, it surprisingly shares high structural similarity with two functionally non-related proteins such as ribose-1,5-bisphosphate isomerase (R15Pi) and the regulatory subunits of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2B (eIF2B). To identify the distinct structural features that lead to divergent functional obligations of M1Pi as well as to understand the mechanism of enzyme catalysis, the crystal structure of M1Pi from a hyperthermophilic archaeon Pyrococcus horikoshii OT3 was determined. A meticulous structural investigation of the dimeric M1Pi revealed the presence of an N-terminal extension and a hydrophobic patch absent in R15Pi and the regulatory a-subunit of eIF2B. Furthermore, unlike R15Pi in which a kink formation is observed in one of the helices, the domain movement of M1Pi is distinguished by a forward shift in a loop covering the active-site pocket. All these structural attributes contribute towards a hydrophobic microenvironment in the vicinity of the active site of the enzyme making it favorable for the reaction mechanism to commence. Thus, a hydrophobic active-site microenvironment in addition to the availability of optimal amino-acid residues surrounding the catalytic residues in M1Pi led us to propose its probable reaction mechanism via a cis-phosphoenolate intermediate formation.

AB In a number of conformational diseases, intracellular accumulation of proteins bearing non-native conformations occurs. The search for compounds that are capable of hindering the formation and accumulation of toxic protein aggregates and fibrils is an urgent task. Present fluorescent methods of fibrils' detection prevent simple real-time observations. We suppose to use green fluorescent protein fused with target protein and fluorescence lifetime measurement technique for this purpose.
   The recombinant proteins analyzed were produced in E. coli. Mass spectrometry was used for the primary structure of the recombinant proteins and post-translational modifications identification. The fluorescence lifetime of the superfolder green fluorescent protein (SF) and the SF protein fused with islet amyloid polypeptide (SF-IAPP) were studied in polyacrylamide gel using Fluorescent-Lifetime Imaging Microscopy (FLIM).
   It was shown that the SF average fluorescence lifetime in gel slightly differs from that of the SF-IAPP monomer under these conditions. SF-IAPP does not lose the ability to form amyloid-like fibrils. Under the same conditions (in polyacrylamide gel), SF and SF-IAPP monomers have similar fluorescence time characteristics and the average fluorescence lifetime of SF-IAPP in fibrils significantly decreases.
   We propose the application of FLIM to the measurement of average fluorescence lifetimes of fusion proteins (amyloidogenic protein-SF) in the context of studies using cellular models of conformational diseases.

AB Isoprimeverose-producing enzymes (IPases) release isoprimeverose (alpha-D-xylopyranosyl-(1 -> 6)-D-glucopyranose) from the non -reducing end of xyloglucan oligosaccharides. Aspergillus oryzae IPase (IpeA) is classified as a member of the glycoside hydrolase family 3 (GH3); however, it has unusual substrate specificity compared with other GH3 enzymes. Xylopyranosyl branching at the non -reducing ends of xyloglucan oligosaccharides is vital for IpeA activity. We solved the crystal structure of IpeA with isoprimeverose at 2.4 angstrom resolution, showing that the structure of IpeA formed a dimer and was composed of three domains: an N-terminal (beta/alpha)(8) TIM -barrel domain, alpha/beta/alpha sandwich fold domain, and a C-terminal fibronectin-like domain. The catalytic TIM -barrel domain possessed a catalytic nucleophile (Asp300) and acid/base (Glu524) residues. Interestingly, we found that the cavity of the active site of IpeA was larger than that of other GH3 enzymes, and subsite -1' played an important role in its activity. The glucopyranosyl and xylopyranosyl residues of isoprimeverose were located at subsites -1 and -1', respectively. Gln58 and Tyr89 contributed to the interaction with the xylopyranosyl residue of isoprimeverose through hydrogen bonding and stacking effects, respectively. Our findings provide new insights into the substrate recognition of GH3 enzymes.

AB Flavodiiron proteins (FDPs) play key roles in biological response mechanisms against oxygen and/or nitric oxide; in particular they are present in oxygenic phototrophs (including cyanobacteria and gymnosperms). Two conserved domains define the core of this family of proteins: a N-terminal metallo-beta-lactamase-like domain followed by a C-terminal flavodoxin-like one, containing the catalytic diiron centre and a FMN cofactor, respectively. Members of the FDP family may present extra modules in the C-terminus, and were classified into several classes according to their distribution and composition. The cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC6803 contains four Class C FDPs (Flv1-4) that include at the C-terminus an additional NAD(P)H:flavin oxidoreductase (FlR) domain. Two of them (Flv3 and Flv4) have the canonical diiron ligands (Class C, Type 1), while the other two (Flv1 and Flv2) present different residues in that region (Class C, Type 2). Most phototrophs, either Bacterial or Eukaryal, contain at least two FDP genes, each encoding for one of those two types. Crystals of the Flv1 two core domains (Flv1-Delta FlR), without the C-terminal NAD(P)H:flavin oxidoreductase extension, were obtained and the structure was determined. Its pseudo diiron site contains non-canonical basic and neutral residues, and showed anion moieties, instead. The presented structure revealed for the first time the structure of the two-domain core of a Class C-Type 2 FDP.

AB Objectives: To examine the prevalence and correlates of excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) among Hong Kong children and adolescents. We investigated the potential roles of sex and puberty in modulating the occurrence of EDS.
   Methods: A total of 10,086 students (male, 48.1%) aged 6-18 (mean +/- SD: 12.3 +/- 3.2) years old participated in this cross-sectional survey. EDS was defined by a total score >18 on the Pediatric Daytime Sleepiness Scale. Sociodemographic characteristics, time in bed, chronotypes, sleep problems, emotional and behavioral difficulties, mental health, and pubertal stages were assessed.
   Results: The overall prevalence of EDS was 29.2%, and increased from 19.8% at Tanner stage 1 (pre-puberty) to 47.2% at Tanner stage 5 (post-puberty). Female predominance emerged at Tanner stage 3 (mid-puberty). EDS was significantly associated with short weekday time in bed, both long and short weekend time in bed, eveningness chronotype, insomnia symptoms, and sleep-disordered breathing symptoms. Females were more likely to have short weekday time in bed and eveningness chronotype than males. Children and young adolescents at pre and mid-puberty were protected against EDS by morningness chronotype. EDS was independently associated with daytime napping, alcohol and energy beverage consumption, emotional and behavioral difficulties, as well as poor mental health even after adjusting for potential confounding factors.
   Conclusions: EDS is prevalent among children and adolescents with the emergence of female preponderance at mid-puberty and independent association with pervasive adverse emotional and behavioral problems. The mechanisms underlying the modulation effects of sex and puberty on EDS merit further investigation. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Objective: We sought to assess sleep characteristics in children with sickle cell anemia (SCA) to investigate the possible association between sleep-related disorders and parameters of endothelial function.
   Methods: Sleep Disturbance Scale for Children (SDSC) and endothelial function variables (flow-mediated dilatation using brachial artery ultrasound, cytokines) were compared in children with SCA and healthy children aged 6e18 years.
   Results: Flow-mediated dilation (FMD) median (IQR) values were 10.1 (6.4; 14) vs 16.9 (12; 26.4), in the SCA and comparison groups (p = 0.001), respectively. Associations were found between difficulty initiating and maintaining sleep as well as IL-12p70 (rs = 0.3, p = 0.03) and IL-1b (rs = 0.4, p = 0.01); disorders of excessive sleepiness and TNF-a (rs = 0.3, p = 0.02), IL-6 (rs = 0.3, p = 0.03), e IL-17A (rs = 0.3, p = 0.04), and disorders of arousal with IL-6 (rs = 0.3, p = 0.04). Regarding SDSC subscales, the score for sleep breathing disorders was higher in the SCA group than in the comparison group [6.7 (3.4) vs. 5.2 (2.7), p = 0.04]. Sleep breathing disorders, disorders of excessive sleepiness and sleep hyperhidrosis scores were also higher among those SCA patients who were using hydroxyurea than those with SCA who were not using hydroxyurea [7.4 (3.9) vs. 5.9 (2.9); p = 0.026; 7.5 (3.5) vs. 6.9 (3); p = 0.028; 4.3 (3.1) vs. 3.9 (2.6); p = 0.044, respectively].
   Conclusion: The SCA group presented higher sleep-disordered breathing scores and lower FMD values. Patients with SCA using hydroxyurea exhibited a higher frequency of scores on SDSC subscales. A positive correlation was found between SDSC subscales and cytokines. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Objective: Childhood sleep-related rhythmic movement disorder (RMD) (ie, sleep-related repetitive movements involving large muscle groups) can impair sleep quality, cause local injury, and disturb household members. Previous parental reports indicate prevalence rates in children under three years of age between 5.5 and 67%. We studied the prevalence of RMD with objective home videosomnography.
   Methods: Parents of 707 children having their one-year routine health check (357 male), 740 children having their two-year health check (395 male), and 17 children of unknown age (nine male), were asked if their child showed sleep-related rhythmic movements. If telephone interview confirmed likely RMD, parents completed a standardised clinical questionnaire and three nights of home videosomnography.
   Results: At the one-year health check, 31/707 possible cases of RMD were identified [maximal prevalence: 4.38%; 95% CI (2.81, 5.89)] compared to 11/740 at the two-year check [maximal prevalence: 1.49%, 95% CI (0.61, 2.36)]. Of 42 possible cases, nine had resolved; 14 were uncontactable, or did not wish to participate, and four did not complete the study protocol. In four of 10 remaining one-year olds and four of five remaining two-year olds parental report was objectively confirmed by videosomnography. Minimal prevalence based on objective observation was therefore 0.28% [95% CI (0.08, 1.30)] at one-year check and 0.41% [95% CI (0.08, 1.24)] at two-year check.
   Conclusions: Prevalence of RMD in a large population of infants and toddlers was lower than previously reported (maximum prevalence 2.87%, minimum prevalence 0.34%). It is important to confirm parental report using objective measures. (c) 2018 Published by Elsevier B.V.

DE Epilepsy; Sleep architecture; Hypnogram; NREM sleep; REM sleep
ID DAYTIME SLEEPINESS; UNTREATED PATIENTS; LOBE EPILEPSY; PARAMETERS;
   DYNAMICS; THERAPY
AB Objectives: To assess whether sleep architecture differs in subgroups of adults with epilepsy or in adults with epilepsy compared to control populations.
   Methods: We completed a systematic review of papers published in two databases up to May 2018, with adults with epilepsy who have undergone either two consecutive nights of in-laboratory polysomnography (PSG) or one night of ambulatory PSG. Our review followed the PRISMA statements and guidelines and the protocol was registered in the PROSPERO platform prior to initiation of the review process (record CRD42018084009).
   Results: Five studies out of 872 fulfilled our eligibility criteria. Only one study reported a significant difference in any sleep architecture parameter in group comparisons. Crespel et al., found that wake after sleep onset (WASO) time in minutes was higher in patients with refractory temporal lobe epilepsy when compared to refractory frontal lobe epilepsy (78.2 +/- 5.3 vs. 28.1 +/- 2.2; p < 0.01) and healthy controls (78.2 +/- 5.3 vs. 27.9 +/- 18.9; p < 0.007).
   Conclusions: Only a few studies objectively assessed sleep in adults with epilepsy while controlling for key factors that influence sleep. However, even those reports are heterogeneous in regards to methodology and population characteristics. Further studies are required to access the extent of sleep architectural abnormalities in adults with epilepsy. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Objectives: To examine associations between parent-reported child sleep walking or talking, nightmares, and trouble sleeping at age eight and psychiatric problems in adulthood (age 30-35) in extremely low birth weight (ELBW; <1000 g) survivors and matched normal birth weight (NBW; >2500 g) control participants.
   Methods: At age eight, parents of ELBW survivors and NBW control participants completed sleep items on the Child Behavior Checklist assessing the presence of sleep walking/talking, nightmares, or trouble sleeping. At age 30-35, 98 ELBW and 94 NBW individuals completed the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI), Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI), and Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). Analyses were conducted in each birth weight group independently.
   Results: In NBW participants, sleep walking/talking in childhood predicted higher BAI and BDI scores, as well as more than three times the odds of having a mood or anxiety disorder (OR = 3.48; 95% CI, 1.26 -9.60) at age 30-35. Sex and childhood sleep problem interactions revealed that females who manifested sleep walking/talking as children had higher BAI scores than males. Nightmares in children born at NBW predicted higher BAI scores. These associations persisted despite adjustment for child mental health, sex, socioeconomic status, sexual or physical abuse, and family functioning. Trouble sleeping in childhood did not predict adult mental health problems. Childhood sleep problems did not predict psychopathology in ELBW adults.
   Conclusions: Children born at NBW who manifest sleep walking or talking appear to be at increased risk for developing mood or anxiety disorders in adulthood. No associations between child sleep and adult mental illness were noted in those with ELBW surviviors. Childhood sleep walking/talking may be a unique risk factor for mental health problems later in life. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In spite of the relatively high incidence rate, the etiology and pathogenesis of restless legs syndrome (RLS) are still unclear. Long-term drug treatments fail to achieve satisfying curative effects, which is reflected by rebound and augmentation of related symptoms. An electrophysiological endophenotype experiment was done to investigate the mechanism of somatosensory disorder among RLS patients. Together with 15 normal subjects as the control group, with comparable ages and genders to the RLS patients, 15 primitive RLS patients were scanned by Magnetoencephalography (MEG) under natural conditions; furthermore, the somatosensory evoked magnetic field (SEF) with single and paired stimuli, was also measured. Compared to the control group, the SEF intensities of RLS patients' lower limbs were higher, and the paired-pulse depression (PPD) for SEF in RLS patients was attenuated. It was also revealed by time-frequency analysis of somatosensory induced oscillation (SIO) in RLS patients, that 93.3% of somatosensory induced Alpha (8-12 Hz) oscillations were successfully elicited, while 0% somatosensory induced Gamma (30-55 Hz) oscillations were elicited; which was significantly different from the control group. Additionally, in RLS patients exhibit increased excitability of the sensorimotor cortex, a remarkable abnormality existing in early somatosensory gating control (GC) and an attenuated inhibitory interneuron network, which consequently results in a compensatory mechanism through which RLS patients increase their attention-driven lower limb sensory gating control via somatosensory-induced Alpha (8e12 Hz) oscillation. This hyperexcitability, partially due to an electrocortical disinhibition, may have an important therapeutical implication, and become an important target of neuromodulatory interventions.

AB Objective: Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a comorbid condition with obesity that can produce deleterious effects on children's health and well-being. Unfortunately, valid instruments for screening OSA in obese Thai children are limited. This study aimed to translate and cross-culturally adapt, from English to Thai, the Sleep-Related Breathing Disordered-Pediatric Sleep Questionnaire (SRBD-PSQ) and to determine its psychometric properties.
   Methods: The SRBD-PSQ was translated into Thai and cross-culturally adapted. It was administered to 62 parents of obese children and adolescents 7-18 years of age who had polysomnographically confirmed OSA. The psychometric properties including validity, reliability, and diagnostic accuracy were examined.
   Results: The Thai SRBD-PSQ possessed excellent content validity index for scale (S-CVI = 0.95). An acceptable internal consistency (cronbach's alpha >= 0.7) and good to excellent test-retest reliability (intraclass correlation coefficients [ICCs] = 0.82-0.90) of the Thai SRBD-PSQ and subdomain were observed. There was a significant correlation between the SRBD scale and polysomnography (PSG) indices: apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) and oxygen desaturation index (ODI) (r = 0.35, p < 0.01, and r = 0.27, p < 0.05, respectively). The Thai SRBD-PSQ had an area under the curve of 0.71 (p < 0.05) with a sensitivity of 72% and a specificity of 54%.
   Conclusion: The Thai SRBD-PSQ is a reliable and valid instrument for use in obese children with OSA. However, the Thai SRBD-PSQ should be used in combination with other investigations. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Objectives: To investigate factors associated with residual sleepiness in patients who were highly adherent to continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). Nocturnal inactivity, comorbidities, concomitant medications, and, in particular, white matter (WM) differences using diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were explored using a continuous-time random-walk (CTRW) model.
   Methods: Twenty-seven male patients (30e55 years of age) with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) received CPAP as the only treatment (CPAP >= 6 h/night) for at least 30 days. Based on the Psychomotor Vigilance Task (PVT) results, participants were divided into a non-sleepy group (lapses <= 5; n = 18) and a sleepy group (lapses > 5; n = 9). Mean nocturnal inactivity (sleep proxy) was measured using actigraphy for one week. Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) with high b-values, as well as diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), was performed on a 3 T MRI scanner. The DWI dataset was analyzed using the CTRW model that yielded three parameters: temporal diffusion heterogeneity alpha, spatial diffusion heterogeneity beta, and an anomalous diffusion coefficient D-m. The differences in alpha, beta, and D-m between the two groups were investigated by a whole-brain analysis using tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS), followed by a regional analysis on individual fiber tracts using a standard parcellation template. Results from the CTRW model were compared with those obtained from DTI. The three CTRW parameters were also correlated with the clinical assessment scores, Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), PVT lapses, and PVT mean reaction time (MRT) in specific fiber tracts.
   Results: There were no differences between groups in mean sleep duration, comorbidities, and the number or type of medications, including alerting and sedating medications. In the whole-brain DWI analysis, the sleepy group showed higher a (17.27% of theWMvoxels) and D-m (17.14%) when compared to the non-sleepy group (P < 0.05), whereas no significant difference in beta was observed. In the regional fiber analysis, the sleepy and non-sleepy groups showed significant differences in alpha, beta, or their combinations in a total of 12 fiber tracts; whereas similar differences were not observed in DTI parameters, when age was used as a covariate. Additionally, moderate to strong correlations between the CTRW parameters (alpha, beta, or D-m) and the sleepiness assessment scores (ESS, PVT lapses, or PVT MRT) were observed in specific fiber tracts (vertical bar R vertical bar = 0.448-0.654, P = 0.0003-0.019).
   Conclusions: The observed differences in the CTRW parameters between the two groups indicate that WM alterations can be a possible mechanism to explain reversible versus residual sleepiness observed in OSA patients with identical high level of CPAP use. The moderate to strong correlations between the CTRW parameters and the clinical scores suggest the possibility of developing objective and quantitative imaging markers to complement clinical assessment of OSA patients.

ID POSITIVE AIRWAY PRESSURE; OBSTRUCTIVE SLEEP-APNEA; THERAPY
AB Objective: Only a few studies have addressed strategies to improve continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) adherence in children with obstructive sleep apnea. The aim of our study was to assess the efficacy of a table based on token economy to improve CPAP adherence. Methods: A table was proposed to children nonadherent to CPAP (<3 h per night of CPAP use), eight days after CPAP initiation (D8). The child has to fill the table on a daily basis with green (I used my CPAP this night) or red (I did not use my CPAP) tokens. Objectives of CPAP use and rewards were decided between the child and their parents. An assessment of CPAP adherence was performed one month after initiation of table filling (M1) and compared to CPAP adherence at D8, and to data of adherent children. Results: Data of six nonadherent and nine adherent children were gathered (age 5 +/- 5 vs. 5 +/- 3 years, p = 0.953; apnea-hypopnea index 20 +/- 15 vs. 25 +/- 16 events/h, p = 0.550, respectively). Mean CPAP adherence at D8 was 4.7 +/- 1.6 nights/wk and 1h00 +/- 0h33 in the nonadherent children, vs. 6.9 +/- 0.4 nights/ wk and 7h16 +/- 1h51 in the adherent group (p < 0.01). The mean number of nights per week at M1 was 6.4 +/- 0.6 nights in nonadherent children (p = 0.086), and was equivalent to that in adherent children (6.8 +/- 0.6 nights, p = 0.126). Mean adherence at M1 increased to 4h31 +/- 1h12 in non-adherent children (p < 0.001), but was still lower when compared to that in adherent children (7h27 +/- 2h00, p = 0.007). Conclusion: The study findings imply that use of a simple table by a child appears to be effective in improving CPAP adherence at one month. (c) 2018 Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI Insufficient sleep and suicidal ideation: a survey of 12,046 female
   adolescents
SO SLEEP MEDICINE
LA English
DT Article
DE Insomnia; Suicidal ideation; Adolescents
ID ELDERLY INDIVIDUALS; DURATION; ASSOCIATIONS; SCHOOL; QUALITY; AGE
AB Objectives: Adolescence is a period of adaptation to social, hormonal, and physical changes. Because of these changes, adolescents are at risk for depression and suicidal thoughts. Female adolescents tend to be more sensitive to hormonal and emotional changes. Although the reciprocal relationship among depression, poor sleep quality, and suicide has been studied, whether decreased sleep time leads to depression-mediated suicide or induces suicide itself remains to be determined. Therefore, this study aimed to analyze (using a path analysis) the indirect (i.e., due to depression) and direct effects of sleep on suicidal ideation for female adolescents.
   Methods: We use nationally representative data from the Korean juvenile health behavior online survey to analyze the sleep effects on suicidal ideation. A total of 12,046 Korean female adolescents were included in this study. We analyzed data from the juvenile health behavior online survey (2017) conducted by the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and identified variables that could affect the mental health of female adolescents. A path analysis was performed to determine the direct role of sleep in suicidal ideation.
   Results: Decreased sleep was one of the several risk factors for suicidal ideation. Unexpectedly, after controlling for other risk factors including depression and socioeconomic factors, insufficient sleep was found to have direct effects on suicidal ideation. The indirect effect of insufficient sleep on suicidal ideation was mediated by depression.
   Conclusion: Sleep is a modifiable factor that could reduce the suicide rate among female adolescents and could be targeted through public health prevention efforts. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Objective: Deficiency in 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) has been associated with sleep disorders in adults. Only three cross-sectional studies were performed in children; which showed an association between 25OHD deficiency and both obstructive sleep apnea syndrome and primary snoring. No longitudinal study has been performed in children from the general population. We analyzed the association between cord-blood vitamin D levels at birth and night-sleep duration trajectories for children between 2 and 5-6 years old in a non-clinical cohort.
   Method: We included 264 children from the French EDEN mother-child birth-cohort with cord-blood 25OHD level determined by radio-immunoassay at birth, and night-sleep trajectories for children between 2 and 5-6 years old obtained by the group-based trajectory modeling method. Associations between 25OHD and sleep trajectories were assessed by multinomial logistic regression adjusted for maternal and child characteristics.
   Results: The trajectories short sleep (<10h30/night), medium-low sleep (10h30-11h00/night), medium-high sleep (approximate to 11h30/night), long sleep (>= 11h30/night) and changing sleep (decreased from >= 11h30 to 10h30-11h00/night) represented 5%, 46%, 37%, 4% and 8% of the children, respectively. The mean 25OHD level was 19 ng/ml (SD = 11, range 3-63). It was 12 (SD = 7), 20 (SD = 11), 19 (SD = 10), 14 (SD = 7) and 16 (SD = 8) ng/ml for children with short, medium-low, medium-high, long and changing sleep trajectories, respectively. On adjusted analysis, for each 1-ng/ml decrease in 25OHD level, the odds of belonging to the short sleep versus medium-high sleep trajectory was increased (odds ratio = 1.12, 95% confidence interval [1.01-1.25]). We found no other significant association between 25OHD level and other trajectories.
   Conclusion: A low 25OHD level at birth may be associated with an increased probability of being a persistent short sleeper in preschool years. These results need confirmation. (c) 2018 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

AB Objective: Sleep quality is closely related to bone health. Aging and estrogen deficiency are known determinants of poor sleep quality and osteoporosis. However, the impact of aging and menopause on the associations between sleep quality and bone mineral density (BMD) remains unclear. This study aimed to examine the association between sleep quality and BMD in Chinese women vary by age groups and menopausal status.
   Methods: A total of 2067 women aged 18e80 years were included. Sleep quality was measured using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and the score >7 was indicative of poor sleep quality. BMD was determined using the dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. Participants were categorized into three age groups. Multiple linear regression models were conducted to evaluate the associations between sleep quality and BMD. Covariates included in the models were age, menopausal status, weight, height, percent body fat, physical activity, alcohol drinking, calcium supplement use, marital status, education and metabolic diseases.
   Results: We observed that poor sleep quality was correlated to low total BMD and legs BMD in middle-aged women after adjusting for potential confounders. Furthermore, when we reran the regression models based on menopausal status in middle-aged women, significant associations between BMD and sleep quality were observed in premenopausal and early postmenopausal groups.
   Conclusion: Our findings showed a more robust association between sleep quality and BMD in premenopausal and early menopausal groups. Further studies should be conducted to explore whether sleep quality intervention would improve bone health of women in these periods and prevent osteoporosis in their late life.

AB Background: Recent studies have suggested that cerebral ischemic infarction may contribute to the development of restless legs syndrome (RLS). This study analyzed the clinical and radiological profiles of RLS with onset after acute lacunar infarction.
   Methods: In this retrospective study we enrolled 244 consecutive patients with acute lacunar infarction between January 2012 and June 2014. RLS was identified and evaluated based on the International RLS Rating Scale (IRLS-RS). Individual sleep quality was assessed using the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS). Psychological state was also assessed using the Hamilton Depression Scale (HDS) and the Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAS).
   Results: The incidence of RLS in patients with lacunar infarction was 5.33%. Our participant group consisted of nine males and four females. Three patients had symptoms in bilateral limbs, and 10 patients had symptoms only contralateral to the cerebral infarction. The infarctions were localized to the pons, centrum semiovale, thalamus, putamen, medulla, and occipital lobe. Contralateral paralysis was found in 13 patients, and contralateral sensory deficit in seven patients. The average IRLS-RS, ESS, HDS, HAS scores were 19.07 +/- 8.70, 4.69 +/- 5.82, 4.38 +/- 4.68, and 3.85 +/- 4.76, respectively. Nine patients had diabetes mellitus. After administration of dopaminergic drugs, patients' RLS significantly improved.
   Conclusions: The incidence of RLS after acute lacunar infarction was 5.33%. Pons, centrum semiovale, and basal ganglia were the common locations of responsible lesions. Compared to idiopathic RLS, symptoms of RLS after acute lacunar infarction appeared more unilateral and more likely involved the arm. Moreover, diabetes mellitus may be a risk factor for RLS in stroke patients. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Objective: To assess the evolution of narcolepsy symptoms in first-, second, and third-degree relatives and to compare multiplex and simplex families.
   Methods: A total of 4045 family members and 362 narcoleptic individuals were entered in the study; with 3255 family members interviewed twice, five to seven years apart. A control group (n = 178) composed of spouses or housemates was also interviewed twice. Family members were divided according to their blood relationship with the probands and further divided into multiplex (ie, more than one narcolepsy cases) and simplex (only one narcolepsy case) families. Telephone interviews were conducted with the help of the Sleep-EVAL system; narcolepsy probands were evaluated and diagnosed by a Sleep Specialist in a Sleep Clinic Center.
   Results: A total of 1123 family members from 72 families were identified as members of multiplex families while the rest of the sample were a part of simplex families (n = 2132). Multiplex families had higher incidence and chronicity of hypersomnolence than the simplex family members and the control group. For cataplexy-like symptoms, only prevalence at the time of the first assessment distinguished multiplex (5.5%) and simplex (2.9%) families. Prevalence of sleep paralysis was higher among the first- and second-degree relatives coming from multiplex families, while incidence was the highest among second-and third-degree relatives. Hypnagogic hallucinations had similar prevalence between multiplex and simplex families but the incidence and chronicity were significantly higher among multiplex families. For each symptom, predictive factors were also determined in simplex and multiplex families.
   Conclusions: Our results show that individuals coming from multiplex families are at greater risks of a broad range of narcolepsy symptoms compared to simplex families. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Objective: Daytime sleepiness is common in women and has negative health effects. Nocturnal gastroesophageal reflux (nGER) and snoring are risk factors for daytime sleepiness, but the effect of their interaction remains unknown. The aim of this study was to examine how nGER and snoring combined affected daytime sleepiness and involuntary falling asleep in women.
   Methods: A questionnaire was sent to randomly selected women in 2000 and 2010. Participants who answered questions regarding both nGER and snoring in both questionnaires were included (N = 4882). Daytime sleepiness was defined as severe or very severe problems with daytime sleepiness. Involuntary falling asleep was defined as sometimes, often or very often falling asleep involuntarily during the day. Respondents snoring loudly and disturbingly sometimes, often or very often were defined as snorers. Having nocturnal heartburn or acid reflux sometimes, often or very often was defined as having nGER.
   Results: Daytime sleepiness was reported by 14% of the participants, involuntary falling asleep by 11%. After adjustment for age, smoking, physical activity, caffeine intake and alcohol dependency, increased odd ratios (ORs) for both daytime sleepiness (adjusted OR 4.2, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.9-9.2) and involuntary falling asleep (adjusted OR 3.1, 95% CI: 1.5-6.4) were seen in women with the combination of nGER and snoring at both baseline and follow-up. The association with daytime sleepiness was also strong for those with only persistent nGER but not for those with only persistent snoring.
   Conclusion: Women with nGER were at increased risk of developing daytime sleepiness and snoring augmented this association. In addition, women with both nGER and snoring were also at increased risk of developing involuntary falling asleep. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Objective: Increased blood coagulation might be one important mechanism linking obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) with cardiovascular diseases. We tested the association between several hemostatic parameters and sleep breathing-related variables in a representative pediatric population with a clinical suspicion of OSA.
   Methods: Polysomnography was performed in 152 snoring children to diagnose OSA. Anthropometric and clinical data were registered and venous blood samples were collected for the measurement of platelet count, plateletcrit, platelet distribution width (PDW), mean platelet volume (MPV), prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), fibrinogen and C-reactive protein.
   Results: Children with OSA had significantly higher platelet count, plateletcrit and PDW compared with those without OSA. After controlling for the anthropometric characteristics (age, gender, body mass index (BMI) z-score), platelet count negatively correlated with minimum SaO(2) while the plateletcrit correlated with time with SaO(2) < 90% and MPV correlated with apneaehypopnea index. PT and PT international normalized ratio correlated with mean SaO(2) and aPTT correlated with the oxygen desaturation index.
   Conclusion: Our findings suggest that different OSA-related effects may be factors contributing to an enhanced coagulability in pediatric OSA. Measures reflecting apnea severity and disrupted sleep were associated with clotting factor changes independent of covariates affecting hemostatic function. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB Background: Melatonin modulates the master circadian clock through the activation of G-protein-coupled receptors MT1 and MT2. It is presumed, therefore, that genetic variations in melatonin receptors can affect both sleep and circadian phase. We investigated whether the -1193T > C (rs4753426) polymorphism in the promoter of MT2 receptor gene (MTNR1B) is associated with diurnal preference and sleep habits. This polymorphism was previously associated with sunshine duration, suggesting a role in circadian entrainment.
   Methods: A total of 814 subjects who completed the Morningness-Eveningness and the Munich Chro-notype questionnaires were genotyped for the selected polymorphism. Linear and multinomial regression were performed to test the interaction between gene variants and diurnal preference/sleep habits.
   Results: The -1193C variant was associated with the extreme morningness phenotype in a codominant model (C/C vs. T/T), recessive model (C/C thorn C/T vs. T/T) and alleles (C vs. T). A negative correlation was found between -1193C alleles and social jetlag scores. The frequency of -1193T allele was higher in the group that stay in bed more than 8 h/night compared to the group that stay in bed less than 8 h/night on weekends.
   Conclusion: To the best of our knowledge, these data provide the first insights into the role of MTNR1B gene in the regulation of sleep, biological rhythms, and entrainment in humans. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Introduction: Given conflicting data in the literature, the aim of this study was to examine the risk of high blood pressure (HBP) associated with sleep alterations, measured during polysomnography, and long-term use of benzodiazepine receptor agonists in a large sample of individuals with insomnia.
   Methods: Demographic and polysomnographic data from 1272 individuals with insomnia recruited from the research database of the sleep laboratory of Erasme Hospital were analyzed. HBP status was defined by the presence of one of the following: self-report at interview of either a physician's diagnosis or taking antihypertensive medication; or an average systolic blood pressure >= 140 mm Hg or an average diastolic blood pressure >= 90 mm Hg at the medical examination. Logistic regression analyses were conducted to examine the risk of HBP associated with objective sleep alterations and long-term use of benzodiazepine receptor agonists in individuals with insomnia.
   Results: The prevalence of HBP in individuals with insomnia is 30.03%. After adjustment for major confounding factors associated with HBP, multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that short sleep duration (<5 h), severely reduced sleep efficiency (<65%), high sleep fragmentation (sleep fragmentation index >18/h), and long-term use of short or intermediate half-life benzodiazepine receptor agonists were significant risk factors for HBP in individuals with insomnia.
   Conclusion: In individuals with insomnia, objective sleep alterations and long-term use of short or intermediate half-life benzodiazepine receptor agonists are associated with higher risk of HBP. Therefore, better management of these reversible risk factors is required to avoid the negative consequences of the co-occurrence of insomnia and HBP. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Objective: To explore the correlates of nocturnal sleep duration, nocturnal sleep variability, and nocturnal sleep problems in a sample of Australian toddlers.
   Methods: Participants were 173 toddlers (average age 19.7 +/- 4.1 months) from the GET UP! Study. Nocturnal sleep duration, nocturnal sleep variability, nap(s) and physical activity were measured using 24-h accelerometry (Actigraph GT3X+) over seven consecutive days. Nocturnal sleep problems were assessed using the Tayside Children's Sleep Questionnaire. Screen time was reported by the parents. Logistic regression models were used to examine the associations between potential correlates (ie, age, sex, socio-economic status, weight status, physical activity, screen time, nap(s), bedtimes, and wake-up times) and nocturnal sleep characteristics.
   Results: Older children were more likely to have greater sleep variability (OR: 1.97; 95% CI: 1.08-3.61). Less physical activity (OR: 2.38; 95% CI: 1.27-4.45), shorter nap(s) (OR: 2.42, 95% CI: 1.29-4.55), and later wake-up times (OR: 4.42; 95% CI: 2.32-8.42) were associated with higher odds of having longer nocturnal sleep duration. Late bedtimes were associated with shorter nocturnal sleep duration (OR: 0.09; 95% CI: 0.04-0.18) and with greater nocturnal sleep variability (OR: 1.97; 95% CI: 1.06-3.68). None of the potential correlates were associated with nocturnal sleep problems.
   Conclusion: The present study identifies several correlates of nocturnal sleep duration (total physical activity, nap(s), bedtime, and wake-up time) and nocturnal sleep variability (age and bedtime), whereas no correlates were identified for nocturnal sleep problems. The association between late bedtimes and shorter nocturnal sleep duration and greater nocturnal variability suggests that these may be modifiable targets for future sleep interventions in early childhood.

AB Objective: Patients with chronic excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) complain of substantial attention deficits. However, their underlying neuronal dysfunction is largely unknown. Previous studies showed similar attention performances in central disorders of hypersomnolence suggesting that EDS-related cognitive impairment is independent of its cause. The aim of the current study was to further explore attentional profiles in disorders of chronic EDS.
   Methods: Ten patients with narcolepsy type 1 (NT1; age 26.7 +/- 9.3 years), 14 patients with idiopathic hypersomnia (IH; age 26.7 +/- 9.3 years), 14 patients with subjective EDS (sEDS; age 31.4 +/- 14.3 years), ie, a mean sleep latency > 8 min in the multiple sleep latency test (MSLT), and 20 healthy controls (HC; age 32.6 +/- 11.3 years) performed the vigilance task and the selective attention task of the test battery SLEEP (R) (Vienna Test System Neuro (R)). We assessed mean response time (RT) and standard deviation of RT separately for the first and the second half of the vigilance task to evaluate performance changes over time (time on task effect; TOT).
   Results: A significant interaction effect between group and TOT on the mean RT in the vigilance task suggests partly group-specific attention deficits. Combining paradigms of sustained and selective attention discriminated patients with NT1, IH, sEDS and HC. Behavioral results were unrelated to the mean sleep latency in the MSLT.
   Conclusions: Discriminative performance of the sustained and selective attention tasks indicate diseasespecific components of attention in NT1, IH, and sEDS. Different temporal dynamics of attentional control efficiency might be one factor underlying group differences. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Objective: Behavioral sleep interventions are regularly used to improve sleep problems experienced by children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and/or intellectual disability (ID). Recent developments have seen the introduction of parent sleep education and healthy sleep practice training to sleep interventions. This article aims to systematically review the evidence on the efficacy of parent training that is incorporated within recent sleep interventions for children with ASD and/or ID.
   Method: Electronic databases and manual searches of reference lists identified 11 studies (n = 416 children) that met the inclusion criteria.
   Results: The evidence presented in this systematic review would suggest that the inclusion of parent training within behavioral sleep interventions for children with ASD and/or ID is generally effective and valued by parents. Nine of the 11 studies reviewed reported a reduction in sleep problems.
   Conclusion: The literature conveys an emerging evidence-based practice that could contribute to future behavioral sleep research and guide best-practice decisions to support effective parent training to improve sleep outcomes for children with ASD and/or ID.

AB Objective: To systematically review the effects of bilevel ventilatory support (BVS) in patients with Obesity Hypoventilation Syndrome (OHS).
   Methods: A search of databases (MEDLINE accessed by PubMed, Cochrane CENTRAL, EMBASE and LILACS) was conducted from inception to June 2018. Randomized trials comparing BVS to other therapeutic modalities such as lifestyle counseling, continuous positive airway pressure (PAP) or BVS with average volume assured pressure support for the treatment of patients with OHS were included. The primary outcome was a change in daytime arterial carbon dioxide levels (PaCO2). Secondary outcome measures included arterial partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2), blood bicarbonate (HCO3), percentage of total sleep time (TST) with oxygen saturation <90%, transcutaneous pressure of carbon dioxide (PtcCO(2)), Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), Medical Outcome Survey Short Form (SF36), Functional Outcomes of Sleep Questionnaire (FOSQ), Severe Respiratory Insufficiency Questionnaire (SRI), compliance with treatment, and weight loss.
   Results: Of 176 articles identified, seven studies were included. When BVS was compared to lifestyle counseling, the intervention was superior in improving PaCO2 (-2.90 mmHg; 95% CI -4.28 to -1.52), PaO2 (2.89 mmHg; 95% CI 0.33 to 5.46), HCO3 (-2.55 mmol/L; 95% CI -3.28 to -1.81), percentage of TST<90% (-30.55%; 95% CI -37.98 to -23.12), ESS (-2.52; 95% CI -4.16 to -0.88) and FOSQ (6.33; 95% CI 1.78 to 10.88). However, when BVS was compared to other PAP modalities, there was no difference in any of the outcomes evaluated.
   Conclusions: Treatment using BVS therapy is superior to lifestyle counseling. Different PAP modalities appear to be equally effective in improving outcomes. CRD42017065326. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Objective: A limited number of studies have examined sleep deprivation (SD) among adolescents in Saudi Arabia. This study estimates SD prevalence and associated factors within a nationally representative sample of adolescents in Saudi Arabia.
   Methods: A secondary data analysis of Jeeluna (R), a national cross-sectional school-based survey, was undertaken. Jeeluna assessed health risk behaviors and health status among adolescents (aged 10-19 years) in schools across Saudi Arabia. Based on self-reports of daily average sleep duration, binary logistic regression was used to investigate potential association among SD, socio-demographics, and various health behavior factors.
   Results: Data from 12,121 adolescents (male 51%, female 49%) were analyzed. Early-and middle-stage adolescents constituted the majority (81%) of the sample. SD (sleep <7h/day) was reported by 46% on weekdays and 33% on weekends. Three-fourths of all adolescents reported feeling unrefreshed on awakening. The adjusted odds ratio (A-OR) for SD was higher for adolescents of older age (18-19 years) (OR 1.18, CI 1.05-1.32), female gender (OR 1.23, CI 1.14-1.34), lower perceived socioeconomic status (OR 1.51, CI 1.28-1.78), and those eating less than three main meals per day (OR 1.17, CI 1.09-1.27). In contrast, A-ORs were lower among adolescents reporting television and computer screen exposure of >= 2 h per day (OR 0.81, CI 0.75-0.88; OR 0.83, CI 0.77-0.91), and those taking daytime naps (>= 3 days) per week (OR 0.87, CI 0.81-0.94).
   Conclusions: Sleep deprivation is highly prevalent among adolescents in Saudi Arabia, with reported prevalences being higher on weekdays versus weekends. The study identifies multiple associated factors that can inform preventive strategies and programs to support adolescent sleep and well-being. (c) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Background: Non-REM parasomnias are not uncommon conditions in the general population. Current treatment options are based on small case series and reports. In this study, we aimed to present the clinical experience from a large cohort of patients.
   Patients: Five hundred and twelve patients with Non-REM parasomnia or parasomnia overlap disorder (POD), who had undergone a video polysomnography and were exposed to treatment, were retrospectively identified. Treatment outcome was assessed based on patients' reports, and treatment approach on a locally accepted hierarchy of interventions.
   Results: Forty percent of patients were diagnosed with sleepwalking, 23.8% with mixed-phenotype and 10% with POD. Ultimately, 97.2% reported adequate control of their symptoms. Moreover, 60.1% were treated with pharmacotherapy and 32.0% without, consistent across all phenotypes (p = 0.09). Benzodiazepines were the most common drugs prescribed (47.1%, p < 0.05). In the end, 37.7% of our patients were receiving a benzodiazepine as part of their successful treatment, 11.7% an antidepressant, 9.2% a z-drug, and 10.7% melatonin. Finally, 13.2%, 12.1%, and 5.8% of our patients reported good control of their symptoms with sleep hygiene, management of sleep-disordered breathing, and psychological interventions (cognitive behavioral therapy [CBT] or mindfulness-based stress reduction [MBSR]), as monotherapy, respectively.
   Conclusion: The treatment approach to effective treatment of the patients with Non-REM parasomnias or POD offering first sleep hygiene advice, next treatment of concurrent sleep disorders and management of other priming factors like stress and anxiety, and lastly pharmacotherapy for Non-REM parasomnia is supported by our results. Non pharmacological interventions were effective in one third of our patients, and CBT/MBSR and melatonin appeared promising new treatments. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Objectives: Erectile dysfunction (ED) is highly prevalent in obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), however, the effect of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy on erectile function has not yet been thoroughly investigated in these patients.
   Methods: Ninety-four men with severe OSA (ie, with an apnea-hypopnea-index >= 30/h of sleep) were prospectively evaluated for the presence and severity of ED before and after 6-12 months of CPAP therapy. The abbreviated version of the International Index of Erectile Function, (the IIEF-5) was used to rate erectile function. Furthermore, all study participants responded to standard questionnaires of daytime sleepiness (Epworth Sleepiness Scale), quality of life (WHO Wellbeing 5 questionnaire) and depression (Major Depression Inventory).
   Results: ED as defined by an IIEF-5 score of <= 21 was present in 64 patients (68.1%). CPAP treatment significantly improved erectile function in those patients suffering from moderate and severe ED. Additionally, a trend for a correlation between the improvement of erectile function under CPAP and the hours of its use was observed. Finally, this effect was associated with larger improvements of quality of life in affected patients.
   Conclusions: ED is very frequent in men with severe OSA and can at least partly be reversed by long-term CPAP therapy in most seriously affected patients. The beneficial effect on erectile function may depend on CPAP compliance and is accompanied by improvements of quality of life. Randomized controlled trials are needed to confirm these findings.

AB Objective/Background: Cataplexy is the pathognomonic symptom of narcolepsy type 1 (NT1). Since it is considered difficult to be directly observed or documented by clinicians, its diagnosis relies mainly on history taking. Our study aimed at testing the feasibility of a standardized video recording procedure under emotional stimulation to document cataplexy in the diagnostic work-up of suspected hypersomnia of central origin.
   Patients/Methods: Two-hundred-eight consecutive patients underwent the diagnostic work-up and reached the final diagnosis of NT1 (n = 133), idiopathic hypersomnia or narcolepsy type 2 (IH/NT2 group, n = 33), or subjective excessive daytime sleepiness (sEDS group, n = 42). All subjects underwent a standardized video recording procedure while watching funny movies selected according to individual preferences, and a technician blind to clinical features reviewed the recordings to identify hypotonic phenomena that were finally confirmed by patients.
   Results: The video recording under emotional stimulation captured hypotonic phenomena in 72.2%, 9.1% and 4.8% of NT1, IH/NT2, and sEDS subjects (p < 0.0001), respectively. When tested against CSF hypocretin deficiency, the documentation of a hypotonic episode at the test showed an area under the ROC curve of 0.823 +/- 0.033 (p < 0.0001). NT1 patients under anticataplectic medications showed less frequently hypotonic episodes than untreated ones (48.0% vs 77.8%, p = 0.003).
   Conclusions: A standardized video recording procedure under emotional stimulation can help in the characterization of suspected hypersomnia of central origin. Further multi-center studies are warranted to extend the present findings and integrate a shared procedure for the laboratory work-up of narcolepsy. (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A need exists to develop specific and clinically useful inhibitors of toxic enzymes present in snake venoms, responsible for severe tissue damage and life-threatening effects occurring in thousands of people suffering envenomations globally. LY315920 (Varespladib, S-5920, A-001), a low molecular weight drug developed to inhibit several human secreted phospholipases A(2) (PLA(2)s), was recently shown to also inhibit PLA(2)s in whole snake venoms with high potency, yet no studies have examined its direct effect on purified snake venom PLA(2)s. This work evaluated the ability of LY315920 to neutralize the enzymatic and toxic activities of three isolated PLA(2) toxins of structural groups I (pseudexin) and II (crotoxin B and myotoxin I), and their corresponding whole venoms. In vitro, LY315920 inhibited the catalytic activity of these three enzymes upon a synthetic substrate. The drug also blocked their cytotoxic effect on cultured murine myotubes. In mice, preincubation of the toxins or venoms with LY315920, followed by their intramuscular injection, resulted in significant inhibition of muscle damage. Finally, immediate, independent injection of LY315920 at the site of toxin or venom inoculation also resulted in a large reduction of myonecrosis in the case of pseudexin and myotoxin-I, and of Pseudechis colletti and Bothrops asper whole venoms, suggesting a possible method of drug delivery in emergency situations. Present findings add evidence to suggest the possibility of using LY315920 as a field antidote in snakebites, aiming to limit the myonecrosis induced by many venom PLA2s in the clinical setting.

The main histologic lesions were loss and neuronal vacuolation of Purkinje cells and Wallerian-like degeneration mainly in the cerebellum, suggesting a glycoprotein storage disease. Ipomoea cornea and Ipomoea trifida found in the paddocks were negative for swainsonine, but contained calystegines at 0.02% and 0.06% suggesting that the disease was caused by these substances, which are competitive inhibitors of beta-glucosidase and alpha-galactosidase activities.

TI First reported case of thrombocytopenia from a Heterodon nasicus
   envenomation
SO TOXICON

DT Review
DE Envenomation; Colubridae; Heterodon nasicus
ID SNAKE-BITES; VENOM; PSEUDECHETOXIN
AB Context The vast majority of the 2.5 million annual worldwide venomous snakebites are attributed to Viperidae or Elapidae envenomations. Of the nearly 2000 Colubridae species described, only a handful are known to cause medically significant envenomations. Considered medically insignificant, Heterodon nasicus (Western Hognose Snake) is a North American rear-fanged colubrid common in the legal pet trading industry. Previously reported cases of envenomations describe local pain, swelling, edema, and blistering. However, there are no reported cases of systemic or hematologic toxicity.
   Case details: A 20-year-old female sustained a bite while feeding a captive H. nasicus causing local symptoms and thrombocytopenia. On day three after envenomation, the patient was seen in the emergency department for persistent pain, swelling, and blistering. At that time, she was found to have a platelet count of 90 x 10(9)/L. Previous routine platelet counts ranged from 315 to 373 x 10(9)/L during the prior two years. Local symptoms peaked on day seven post envenomation. Her local symptoms and thrombocytopenia improved on evaluation four months after envenomation.
   Discussion: We report the first Heterodon nasicus envenomation causing both local toxicity and thrombocytopenia. Potential mechanisms based on H. nasicus venom composition are discussed in detail. Treatment is largely supportive. Bites by H. nascius should be evaluated by a toxicologist familiar with Colubridae species. This represents the first reported case of hematologic toxicity from envenomation by a North American colubrid snake.

AB The aim of this study was to obtain the first data on the occurrence and distribution of potentially toxic cyanobacteria and cyanotoxins in the Russian Easternmost part of the Gulf of Finland of the Baltic Sea. Studied samples were collected from 2012 to 2017 and three independent approaches - HPLC-HRMS, PCR and light microscopy were applied for cyanotoxins analysis and detection of toxigenic cyanobacteria. Aphanizomenon flosaquae Ralfs ex Born. et Flah., Planktothrix agardhii (Gom.) Anag. et Kom., Microcystis aeruginosa (Kiltz.) Katz. and Dolichospermum spp. dominated among cyanobacteria in collected samples. In 2012-2013 during research cruises, microcystins concentrations varied from below detection levels to low (0.01-0.6 mu g L-1) values. In the autumn of 2015 and 2017, during cyanobacterial bloom events very high concentrations of microcystins (dissolved up to 49 mu g L-1, intracellular up to 466 mu g g(-1)) and dissolved anatoxin-a (1.4 mu g L-1) were detected. The evaluated toxin profile was represented by most common arginine-containing variants of microcystins (MC-LR, MC-RR, MC-YR) and their desmethylated forms. Leucine-containing congeners (MC-LF; MC-LY; MC-LW for the biomass sample from the coast of Komarovo, 2015) were found at low concentrations. In environmental DNA from bloom samples, we identified mcy genes regions responsible for MC biosynthesis that are specific for Dolichospermum, Microcystis, and Planktothrix. This study is the first molecular evidence the ability of Microcystis aeruginosa and Planktothrix agardhii from the Gulf of Finland to produce microcystins. On the basis of the obtained data of genus-specific PCR and microscopy, we suppose the presence of anatoxin-a-producing Apanizomenon flos-aquae population in the phytoplankton of Russian part of the Gulf of Finland.

AB Kefir is a fermented milk with numerous health favors counting restorative properties of bacterial flora, reduction of the symptoms of lactose intolerance, immune system stimulation, cholesterol reduction, as well as anti-mutagenic and anti-tumor properties. Zearalenone (ZEN) is a mycotoxin produced by some Fusariwn species. ZEN often occurs as a contaminant in cereal grains and animal feeds. Human exposure occurs by ingestion of mycotoxin-contaminated products and can cause serious health problems.
   This study aimed to assess the preventive effect of kefir against ZEN toxicity in cultured HCT-116 colorectal carcinoma cells; by the evaluation of cell viability, oxidative stress status and the initiation of apoptotic cell death pathway.
   Our results demonstrated that ZEN inhibits cell proliferation which was accompanied by an increase in the generation of free radicals as measured by fluorescent 2,7-dichlorofluorescein (DCF) and Malondialdehyde (MDA). As an adaptive response to this redox status, we showed an induction of heat shock protein expression (Hsp 70) and an activation of antioxidant enzymes; catalase and Superoxide Dismutase (SOD). Moreover, a loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (Atpm) was observed. The co-treatment as well as the pre-treatment by kefir showed a reduction of ZEN induced damages for all tested markers. However, the pre-treatment seems to be the most efficient, it prevented almost all ZEN hazards. Consequently, oxidative damage appears to be a key determinant of ZEN induced toxicity in cultured HCT-116 cells. In conclusion, we showed that kefir may better exert its virtue on preventive mode rather than on curative one. By this way, kefir as a beverage with highly antioxidant properties could be relevant particularly with the emergent demand for natural products which may counteract the detrimental effects of oxidative stress and therefore prevent multiple human diseases.

AB Aflatoxin B-1 (AFB(1)) is a secondary metabolite produced by Aspergillus fiavus and other fungi. Soil, crops, food, feed, etc. were susceptible to aflatoxin B-1 contamination, which caused adverse economic and health consequences. It is necessary to search for microorganisms or microbial enzymes that can degrade AFB(1). The degradation activity of AFB(1) by cell-free supernatant (68.30%) of isolate Pantoea sp. T6 was significantly higher (P < 0.05) than viable bacterial cells (4.87%) and intracellular cell extracts (3.68%). The supernatant's AFB(1) degradation activity was reduced from 68.30% to 5.33% in treatment with protease K and sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS). An extracellular enzyme from the supernatant was secreted by Pantoea sp. T6 and was named as Pantoea aflatoxin degradation enzyme (PADE), which was obtained using Diethylaminoethanol (DEAE)Sepharose chromatography. PADE was further purified by sodium dodecyl sulphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). The PADE, outer membrane protein A, was identified by mass spectrometry and molecular mass was 38180.1Da. The optimum temperature and pH for the reaction of PADE with AFBI were 40 degrees C and 7.0, respectively. These finding showing that the PADE, which was isolated from the supernatant of Pantoea sp. T6, has the ability to degrade AFB(1), and may have potential application for aflatoxin B-1 reduction in the food and feed industry.

AB Juglone, a naphthoquinone is a known phytotoxic and cytotoxic allelochemical. Various anticancer studies suggest that pharmacological ROS insult and enzymes inhibited by juglone could be of therapeutic utility. In this study, we show that juglone induces immunomodulation in BCG-vaccinated mice. We have shown that juglone treatment leads to the generation of Th1 cytokines which develops an M1 phenotype in splenic macrophages. These findings were supported by a decrease in Treg population in BCG-vaccinated mice treated with juglone. Additionally, we observed juglone significantly increases CD8(+) and T-helper memory population in BCG-vaccinated mice under immunomodulation. Further, BCG-challenge test showed that juglone enhances effector immune functions. Our finding was demonstrated by estimating ex-vivo Th1 and Th2 cytokines, flow cytometric analysis of Treg, T-helper memory, and CD8(+) cells and determining serum IgG2a/IgG1 titer shift in BCG-vaccinated animals treated with juglone. Collectively, our findings provide evidence that juglone may act as immunomodulator when used at a low dose, metronomically.

AB Mushroom poisoning is a significant and increasing form of toxin-induced-disease. Existing classifications of mushroom poisoning do not include more recently described new syndromes of mushroom poisoning and this can impede the diagnostic process. We reviewed the literature on mushroom poisoning, concentrating on the period since the current major classification published in 1994, to identify all new syndromes of poisoning and organise them into a new integrated classification, supported by a new diagnostic algorithm. New syndromes were eligible for inclusion if there was sufficient detail about both causation and clinical descriptions. Criteria included: identity of mushrooms, clinical profile, epidemiology, and the distinctive features of poisoning in comparison with previously documented syndromes. We propose 6 major groups based on key clinical features relevant in distinguishing between poisoning syndromes. Some clinical features, notably gastrointestinal symptoms, are common to many mushroom poisoning syndromes. Group 1 - Cytotoxic mushroom poisoning. Syndromes with specific major internal organ pathology: (Subgroup 1.1; Primary hepatotoxicity); 1A, primary hepatotoxicity (amatoxins); (Subgroup 1.2; Primary nephrotoxicity); 1B, early primary nephrotoxicity (amino hexadienoic acid; AHDA); 1C, delayed primary nephrotoxicity (orellanines). Group 2 - Neurotoxic mushroom poisoning. Syndromes with primary neurotoxicity: 2A, hallucinogenic mushrooms (psilocybins and related toxins); 2B, autonomic-toxicity mushrooms (muscarines); 2C, CNS-toxicity mushrooms (ibotenic acid/muscimol); 2D, morel neurologic syndrome (Morchella spp.). Group 3 - Myotoxic mushroom poisoning. Syndromes with rhabdomyolysis as the primary feature: 3A, rapid onset (Russula spp.); 3B, delayed onset (Tricholoma spp.). Group 4 - Metabolic, endocrine and related toxicity mushroom poisoning. Syndromes with a variety of clinical presentations affecting metabolic and/or endocrine processes: 4A, GABA-blocking mushroom poisoning (gyromitrins); 4B, disulfiram-like (coprines); 4C, polyporic mushroom poisoning (polyporic acid); 4D, trichothecene mushroom poisoning (Podostroma spp.); 4E, hypoglycaemic mushroom poisoning (Trogia venenata); 4F, hyperprocalcitoninemia mushroom poisoning (Boletus satanas); 4G, pancytopenic mushroom poisoning (Ganoderma neojaponicum). Group 5 - Gastrointestinal irritant mushroom poisoning. This group includes a wide variety of mushrooms that cause gastrointestinal effects without causing other clinically significant effects. Group 6 - Miscellaneous adverse reactions to mushrooms. Syndromes which do not fit within the previous 5 groups: 6A, Shiitake mushroom dermatitis; 6B, erythromelagic mushrooms (Clitocybe acromelagia); 6C, Paxillus syndrome (Paxillus involutus); 6D, encephalopathy syndrome (Pleurocybella porrigens).

AB Accidents involving snakes from the genus Bothrops sp. constitute the most important cause of snake envenomation in Brazil. The Myrsine genus has been reported to be used in folk medicine against snakebites. In this work, the phytochemical profiles and ability of extracts from Myrsine parvifolia leaves to reduce the inflammatory process (edema, vascular permeability increase and leukocyte migration) induced by Bothrops jararaca venom were investigated in vivo. Chemical compounds were identified by chromatographic and spectroscopy techniques. Total polyphenol, tannin, and flavonoid contents were determined by spectrophotometric methods. Swiss male mice received an oral administration of extracts (100 mg/kg) in different protocols. Paw edema, intraperitoneal vascular permeability and pleurisy models in mice were used to evaluate the antiophidic potential of the extracts. Paw edema was induced by subplantar injection of B. jararaca venom and quantified as the increase in paw volume. Changes in vascular permeability were assessed by measuring the amount of Evans blue dye extravasation. Leukocyte migration was assessed by total and differential counts in the pleural cavity washes. Myricetin, myricetin-3-O-beta-arabinopyranoside, quercetin and kaempferol were isolated from the ethyl acetate extract and identified as the primary compounds of the dichloromethane extract. Terpenes and fatty acids were identified in the hexane and dichloromethane extracts. The pretreated group with hydroethanolic and dichloromethane extract reduced total edema (40 and 52%, respectively), vascular permeability increase (32.4 and 32.2%, respectively) and leukocyte influx into the pleural cavity (42 and 39%, respectively), while the group treated with hexane extract showed only reduced edema (37%) induced by B. jararaca venom. The hydroethanolic extract showed better results in all of the tests performed and was also administered by the protocol of post-poisoning, showing maintenance of paw edema reduction and cell migration. These data indicate a potential anti-inflammatory activity of M. parvifolia in poisoning by B. jararaca, especially to reduce local poison effects.

AB Overt myoglobinuria associated with myotoxicity is a classic feature of sea snake envenomation. Russell's viper bites usually result in coagulopathy, neurotoxicity and nephrotoxicity but rarely myotoxicity has been reported, especially in the Sri Lankan variety (Daboia russelii). All those studies have demonstrated mild degree myotoxicity with microscopic level myoglobinuria. We report what is probably the first case of gross myoglobinuria in a child following a Russell's viper bite with biochemical evidence of significant myotoxicity well beyond the levels that have been previously reported.

AB The aim of this paper was to present the first report of Prosopis nigra poisoning of cattle in Argentina. Outbreaks occurred in five farms located in Salta and Santiago del Estero provinces. All animals were examined, euthanized and necropsied. Clinical signs included tongue protrusion, twitches and tremors of muscles of mastication, weight loss and lethargy. Severe atrophy of the masseter, buccinator and lingual muscles was observed, along with neuronal vacuolation in the nuclei of the trigeminal, facial, and hypoglossus nerves. These findings and the clinical signs are consistent with results obtained in animals, spontaneously and experimentally intoxicated with Prosopis juliflora in previous studies. Several species of this genus are native to Argentina. Farmers should be warned about the suspected toxicity by Prosopis nigra, since this species has wide geographical distribution in the country.

AB The scorpion venom is a cocktail of many components. Its composition can exhibit a level of plasticity in response to different behavioral and environmental factors, leading to intraspecific variation. The toxicity and specificity of scorpion venoms appear to be taxon-dependent, due to a co-evolutionary interaction with prey and predators, which shaped the composition at the molecular level. The venom regeneration by the venom glands is an asynchronous process, in which particular components are expressed at different stages and at different rates. According to this, it can be reasonably assumed that the regeneration of toxicity in the venom is also asynchronous. In this work, we studied the toxicity regeneration dynamics by the scorpion Centruroides limpidus after full venom depletion by electrical stimulation. For this, we evaluated the toxicity of venom samples extracted at different days post depletion, against insects (crickets) and mammals (humans, by assessing the venom activity on the human voltage-dependent Na+ channel Nav1.6). The regeneration of toxicity against humans lagged behind that against crickets (13 vs 10 days, respectively). Thirteen days after depletion the venom seems to be replenished. Our results show asynchrony in the regeneration of species-specific toxic activity in the venom of Centruroides limpidus. The understanding of the venom regeneration kinetics for the different scorpion species will help to design venom extraction protocols that could maximize the yield and quality of the collected venoms.

AB Lectins are carbohydrate-binding proteins that play important roles in the immune system. Under specific conditions, lectins can form amyloids, proteinaceous aggregates rich in cross beta-strand structures. A Ca++ dependent lectin, isolated from Bothrops leucurus snake venom (BLL) has demonstrated relevant biological activities such as antibacterial and antitumor activity. In this work, we aimed to study the interaction of BLL with macrophages. The formation of amyloid structures by BLL in a cell culture medium, the effects of the lectin on macrophage morphology and cytokine production were investigated. BLL amyloid-like fibrils in RMPI medium, pH 7.2, at 37 degrees C was confirmed by binding of Congo Red, Thioflavin T and electron microscopy. Neither binding of amyloid markers nor fibrillar structures were found when the lectin was incubated in RPMI plus galactose, the specific BLL-binding carbohydrate. Several phagocytic compartments containing fibrillar structures were observed in BLL-treated macrophages in RPMI medium for 24 h; these compartments showed an apple-green birefringence after Congo Red staining and were positive for thioflavin S and anti-amyloid antibody, indicating the presence of amyloid-like fibrils. No fibrillar material and no labeling were observed when the macrophages were treated with BLL plus galactose or cytochalasin B, an inhibitor of phagocytosis. BLL did not affect the viability of the cells. A significant release of proinflammatory (TNF-alpha, IL-6, INF-gamma and IL-1 beta) and regulatory (IL-10) cytokines was observed in BLL-treated macrophages. Taken together, our results shed light on the structural organization of BLL, improving knowledge about the interaction of lectin with macrophages. The phagocytosis of amyloid-like aggregates together with the proinflammatory response induced by BLL may open new perspectives for the use of this lectin as an interesting model to study cytokines and the production of other mediators as well as understand the mechanisms occurring in human immune cells during amyloid protein deposition.

AB The classical potassium channel inhibitors are toxin peptides from venomous animals, and whether there are peptide inhibitors from other species is an open question. Due to both the independent and interdependent relationships between the spear (peptide inhibitors) and the shield (potassium channels), human defensins were first identified by our group as endogenous potassium channel inhibitors. Encouraged by the discovery of human defensins as potassium channel inhibitors, defensins from invertebrates and fungi were successively found by our group to be potassium channel inhibitors. In addition, a plant defensin was reported to be a potassium channel inhibitor. Since defensins are widely produced by vertebrate, invertebrate, plant and fungi species, the recent work established a new research field on defensin-potassium channel interactions. Here, we review the current work on defensins from vertebrate, invertebrate, plant and fungi species as inhibitors of potassium channels and discuss future work in this research field.

AB Background: Patients with psychiatric disorders (depression, anxiety) are more likely to have poor health behaviours, including higher smoking and lower physical activity (PA) levels. Smoking is a major risk factor for Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), and PA is critical for COPD management. However, no studies have assessed associations between psychological distress and these behaviours among patients with vs without COPD. This is a sub-analysis of the CanCOLD study that assessed the relationships between psychological disorders (depression, anxiety) and poor health behaviours (smoking, PA).
   Methods: 717 COPD and 797 matched non-COPD individuals from the CanCOLD study, completed the Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale (HADS) to assess anxiety and depression. Smoking behaviour was self-reported pack-years smoking. The CHAMPS PA questionnaire determined calorific expenditure as a PA measure. Regressions determined relationships between anxiety/depression and health behaviours, adjusting for age, sex, BMI, GOLD stage and COPD status.
   Results: Across the whole sample, we observed relationships between depression (beta = 1.107 +/- 0.197; 95% CI= 0.691-1.462; p < .001) and anxiety (beta = 0.780 +/- 0.170; 95% CI= 0.446-1.114; p < .001) and pack years. Higher depression (beta = -0.220 +/- 0.028; 95% CI = -0.275 to -0.165; p < .001) and anxiety (beta = -0.091 +/- 0.025; 95% CI = -0.139 to -0.043; p < .001) scores were related to lower PA. These associations were comparable across COPD and non-COPD patients.
   Conclusions: Results showed that higher levels of anxiety and depression were related to higher cumulative smoking and lower levels of PA in patients with and without COPD, suggesting symptoms of psychological distress is similarly associated with poorer health behaviours in COPD and non-COPD individuals. Future studies need to determine if treating symptoms of psychological distress can improve health behaviours and outcomes in this population.

AB Background: Although general practitioners (GPs) are frequently the first healthcare professionals whom asthma patients refer to for their symptoms, few studies have explored the extent of adherence to guidelines for asthma management based on data provided directly by GPs.
   Aims of the present study were to assess drug prescriptions for asthma by GPs and to evaluate prescriptive adherence to GINA guidelines (GL) and its relationship with disease control in real life.
   Methods: 995 asthmatic patients (45% males, mean age 43.3 +/- 17.7 yrs) were enrolled by 107 Italian GPs distributed throughout the country. Data on diagnosis, disease severity, prescribed anti-asthmatic drugs and control were collected through questionnaires filled out by GPs taking into consideration the 2009 GINA Guidelines. Data on drug use and chronic sinusitis, nasal polyposis, chronic bronchitis, emphysema were reported by patients through a self-administered questionnaire.
   Results: The large majority of patients were classified by GPs as having intermittent (48.4%) or mild persistent asthma (25.3%); 61% had co-morbid allergic rhinitis (AR). The prevalent therapeutic regimen used by patients was a combination of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) plus long-acting beta(2)-agonists (LABA) (54.1%), even in the intermittent/mild persistent group. ICS as mono-therapy or in combination with other drugs but LABA, was the second most frequently adopted treatment (14.4%). In general, the GPs adherence to GL treatment indications was 28.8%, with a significant association with a good asthma control (OR 1.85, 95% CI 1.18-2.92). On the other hand, comorbidity (OR 0.52, 95% CI 0.32-0.84), moderate (0.44, 0.28-0.69) and severe (0.06, 0.02-0.20) persistent asthma showed significant negative effects on asthma control.
   Conclusions: Our results show that over-treatment of intermittent/mild persistent asthma is frequent in the GPs setting while therapeutic regimens are more appropriately applied for moderate/severe asthma. In general, we found low adherence to GINA GL treatment recommendations even if its relevance in asthma control was confirmed.

AB Background: In people with moderate-to-severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), the minimal detectable difference (MDD) in endurance shuttle walk test (ESWT) performance following exercise training is unclear. We sought to determine the MDD for ESWT performance following supervised ground-based walking training using anchor- and distribution-based approaches and report whether these values exceeded random variation in test performance.
   Methods: Participants with COPD trained for 30-45 min, 2-3 times weekly for 8-10 weeks. The ESWT was performed before and after the training period. Immediately after training, participants rated their change in walking ability using a Global Rating of Change scale. Receiver Operating Characteristic curves were used to derive the value that best separated those who perceived their improvement in walking ability to be at least 'a little' better from 'almost the same, hardly any change'. These values were compared with those calculated using a distribution-based method. Random variation in test performance was defined as the minimal detectable change (MDC), calculated using the standard error of measurement.
   Results: 78 participants (aged 70 +/- 8 yr and FEV1 43 +/- 15% predicted) completed the ESWT before and after training. The value that best separated those who perceived their walking ability as 'a little' better was 70 s. The 95% confidence intervals around this estimate traversed zero. The distribution-based estimate was 156 s. The MDC was 227 s.
   Conclusions: The MDD established using the anchor- and distribution-based approaches differed considerably. Large variation in test performance cautions against using the MDD to interpret changes in an individual.

   GUIDELINES; ANTIBODIES
AB Introduction: Idiopathic interstitial pneumonias (IIP) are diffuse lung diseases whose cause is unknown and often present with features of autoimmunity despite not meeting criteria for a connective tissue disease (CTD). Recent studies suggest that anti-RNA binding protein (anti-RBP) antibodies, which include anti-SSA, anti-SSB, anti-Sm, and anti-RNP, play a role in the loss of immune tolerance and severity of pulmonary hypertension (PH) in CTDs. We hypothesized that anti-RBP positive (RBP+) subjects would have worse measures of lung function, radiographic findings, PH, and survival than anti-RBP negative (RBP-) subjects.
   Methods: Subjects with both IIP and serologies for review were identified retrospectively and stratified based on anti-RBP antibody seropositivity. Baseline cohort characteristics, pulmonary function tests (PFT), ambulatory oxygen requirement, radiographic characteristics, markers of PH, and transplant-free survival were compared between anti-RBP positive and negative groups.
   Results: Five hundred twenty patients with IIP were identified, of which ten percent (n = 53) were anti-RBP positive. RBP+ as compared to RBP- subjects had significantly worse PFTs as indicated by FEV1 (59.6 vs. 64.9, p = 0.046) and FVC (71.6 vs. 78.8, p = 0.018). There was a higher prevalence of radiographic honeycombing (49.1% vs. 38.3%, p = 0.006) and emphysema (22.6% vs. 5.1%, p < 0.001) in the RBP+ group despite no difference in smoking history. The Pulmonary Artery-Aorta ratio was also larger in the RBP+ group (0.93 vs. 0.88, p = 0.040). There was no difference in transplant-free survival between groups (log rank = 0.912).
   Conclusion: Anti-RBP+ IIP patients may have worse lung function, increased chest radiographic abnormalities, and PH compared with those without these antibodies.

ID EMPHYSEMA; SMOKERS; DISEASE
AB Airway wall thickening in cigarette smokers is thought to be a result of inflammatory changes and airway remodeling. This study investigates if CT-derived airway wall thickening associates to disease severity in smokers with and without COPD and if airway wall thickening is reversible by smoking cessation.
   We examined 2000 smokers and 46 never-smokers who returned for a 5-year follow-up visit in the COPDGene-study. Multivariable regression analyses were performed at visit 1 to associate airway wall thickness (expressed as Pi10) with percent predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1%-predicted), 6-min walking distance (6MWD), and St. George Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ). Longitudinal analyses were performed to assess the effect of smoking cessation on Pi10 using linear mixed models.
   A higher Pi10 was significantly associated with worse FEV1%-predicted, 6MWD, and SGRQ in all GOLD-stages. Longitudinal analyses showed that subjects that quit smoking significantly decreased in Pi10 (Delta Pi10 = -0.18 mm, p < 0.001). Subjects that started smoking had a significant increase in Pi10 (Delta Pi10 = 0.14 mm, p < 0.001).
   Pi10 is a clinically relevant biomarker of smoking-related airway injury in smokers with and without COPD. The change in Pi10 with change in smoking status suggests that it can quantify a reversible component of smoking-related airway inflammation.

   Interstitial lung diseases; Protein-tyrosine kinases
ID FORCED VITAL CAPACITY; EFFICACY; INHIBITOR; SUBGROUPS; SURVIVAL; IMPACT
AB Background: In the INPULSIS (R) trials, nintedanib reduced the annual rate of decline in forced vital capacity (FVC) versus placebo, consistent with slowing of disease progression. We characterised the effects of nintedanib on physiologic outcomes using pooled data from the INPULSIS (R) trials.
   Methods: Post-hoc analyses included changes in FVC over time, cumulative distribution of patients by change in FVC % predicted, and annual rate of decline in FVC in subgroups by diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (DLco) and composite physiologic index (CPI) at baseline. Changes from baseline in DLco and oxygen saturation by pulse oximetry (SpO(2)) were pre-specified.
   Results: Nintedanib significantly reduced FVC decline versus placebo from week 12. A higher proportion of patients treated with nintedanib than placebo had an improvement or no decline in FVC % predicted, whereas a smaller proportion had absolute declines in FVC >= 5% or >= 10% predicted from baseline to week 52. The effect of nintedanib on FVC decline was similar in patients with baseline DLco > 40% versus <= 40% predicted or CPI <= 45 versus > 45. There were no significant differences between nintedanib and placebo in change from baseline in DLco % predicted, CPI, or SpO(2) at week 52. However, change (deterioration) in CPI was significantly lower with nintedanib versus placebo in patients with CPI > 45 at baseline (1.0 versus 2.9) and CPI > 55 at baseline (-1.2 versus 3.3).
   Conclusions: A range of physiologic outcome measures in the INPULSIS (R) trials support the effect of nintedanib on reducing disease progression in patients with IPF.

DT Article
DE Pulmonary Rehabilitation; Exercise; Quality of life; Function;
   Interstitial lung disease
ID FIBROSIS; LIMITATION; DEPRESSION; ANXIETY
AB Background: The inclusion of Pulmonary Rehabilitation as part of the management of Interstitial Lung Disease, although being highly recommended in most recent guidelines, still has limited studies exploring the outcomes from such an intervention. The present study aims to contribute to the available literature by investigating the effects of a high intensity, 12 week PR programme on functional and quality of life measures in patients with a diagnosis of Interstitial Lung Disease.
   Method: ology: This paper reports outcomes of an observational, prospective, quasi experimental type of study. A total of 120 participants were recruited: 60 patients formed part of the active group, and another 60 patients were enrolled in an inactive group. Each participant was classified according to the modified Medical Research Council dyspnoea scale and placed in one of 5 categories (0-4) according to self-perceived breathlessness during daily activities. The following outcomes were measured: Lung function tests including plethysmography and diffusion capacity of carbon monoxide (DLCO), functional tests (6-min walking distance test, Dyspnoea Borg Scale) and health status measures (St George's Respiratory Questionnaire and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Score).
   Results: A 12-week PR programme for patients with Interstitial Lung Disease, led to significant improvements in the active group of patients in the 6 min walking distance test, the modified Borg Scale, mMRC scores and in the health status measures. Lung function measures did not show any significant improvement following this intervention.
   Conclusion: This 12week Pulmonary Rehabilitation programme resulted in improvements in functional aspects for patients with Interstitial Lung Disease. Further studies are recommended as Pulmonary Rehabilitation for Interstitial Lung Disease may have an impact at both an individual level and at global organisational/ financial levels.

AB Accumulating evidence has shown the effects of air pollution on respiratory disease and lung cancer mortality, but the evidence is still inconclusive to date. We conducted a time-series analysis, which included 10388 subjects, to assess the short-term effects of air pollution on respiratory disease and lung cancer mortality in Hefei, China, from 2009 to 2015. The mean concentrations of pollutants (PM10, NO2 and SO2) were 106.35, 30.40, and 20.66 mu g/m(3), respectively, during the study period. An increase of 10 mu g/m(3) in SO2, NO2, and PM10 was associated with 7.69% (95% CI: 3.41%-12.15%), 4.38% (95% CI: 1.33%-7.53%), and 1.55% (95% CI: 0.80%-2.30%) increase of respiratory diseases mortality, respectively. In contrast, lung cancer mortality was only significantly associated with SO2 level. Subgroup analyses showed that female in respiratory disease patients were more sensitive to air pollution than male. Studies about seasonality of pollutants on respiratory and lung cancer mortality were inconsistent. Further analyses with multiple-pollutant model showed that the effects of pollutants were generally decreased after the other pollutants were adjusted, except the effects of SO2 on lung cancer. These findings demonstrated that air pollution could evidently increase the respiratory disease and lung cancer mortality.

AB Backgrounds: Cancer immunotherapy using immune checkpoint inhibitors has received a remarkable amount of attention in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The unique adverse effects known as immune-related adverse events (irAEs) associated with immune checkpoint inhibitors are not known however, and neither is the incidence of infectious disease among patients receiving immune checkpoint inhibitors. The aims of this study were to investigate the incidence of infections during nivolumab treatment, and the risk factors associated with infections.
   Methods: We retrospectively reviewed NSCLC patients who received nivolumab in two teaching hospitals (National Hospital Organization Kyoto Medical Center and Kyoto University Hospital, Kyoto, Japan) between December 2015 and June 2017. We counted any infectious diseases occurring at any time after the initiation of nivolumab until 3 months after its discontinuation. In the current study, "infectious disease" was defined as any infection requiring the administration of any antimicrobial agent.
   Results: Of a total of 167 NSCLC patients reviewed, 32 (19.2%) experienced infectious diseases. Of the 33 infections in 32 patients, 25 were bacterial, 2 were fungal, and 6 were viral. Twenty-seven of the patients with infections used corticosteroids during their treatment course. There was no statistically significant difference in the use of immunosuppressive agents between patients with and without infections. A history of diabetes mellitus was significantly associated with infection (odds ratio 3.61, 95% confidence interval 1.14-11.4, p = 0.028).
   Conclusions: Lung cancer patients receiving nivolumab have a certain level of risk for developing infectious diseases. In the current study, a history of diabetes mellitus was an independent risk factor for infectious disease development. Clinicians should pay attention to occult infectious diseases in patients receiving lung cancer treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors, especially those with the history of diabetes mellitus.

AB Background: The AdvanSure MDR-TB GenoBlot Assay detects isoniazid-and rifampin-resistant tuberculosis using mutation-specific probes, including probes to disputed rpoB mutations. The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical usefulness of molecular drug susceptibility testing (DST) using the AdvanSure assay with weekly batch testing in routine clinical laboratory settings in a country with an intermediate tuberculosis burden.
   Methods: The AdvanSure assay was evaluated against an absolute concentration (AC) method and the Mycobacterial Growth Indicator Tube (MGIT) 960 System, which are phenotypic DST methods, using 496 Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) isolates. We retrospectively reviewed and compared DST results and turnaround times (TATs), the time intervals from MTB culture identification to final reporting, for these methods.
   Results: For rifampin, the AdvanSure assay showed 99.2% (492/496) concordance with both the AC and MGIT methods. AdvanSure also detected an rpoB mutation (D516Y) conferring low-level resistance in three isolates categorized as rifampin-susceptible by both phenotypic DST methods. For isoniazid, AdvanSure concordance rates with the AC method and MGIT DST were 96.6% (479/496) and 95.4% (473/496), respectively. The median TAT of AdvanSure in weekly batch testing was 5.8 days, shorter than the times for the phenotypic DST methods, which were 35.1 days for the AC method and 8.9 days for MGIT DST.
   Conclusions: AdvanSure shows promising clinical usefulness for rapid detection of rifampin-and/or isoniazid-resistant tuberculosis when used as a complementary method to phenotypic DST assays in weekly batch testing. Furthermore, MTB isolates with disputed mutations for rifampin resistance were detectable by the AdvanSure assay.

AB Background: Dyspnea is a common symptom in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The modified Medical Research Council (mMRC) dyspnea scale is a widely used questionnaire to assess dyspnea. However, the relationship of the mMRC dyspnea scale with morphological airway structures in COPD remains unclear. We evaluated the correlation between the mMRC dyspnea scale and imaging-based airway structures in patients with COPD.
   Methods: The wall area (WA) and airway inner luminal area (Ai) of third- to sixth-generation bronchi and the percentage of low attenuation area with less than-950 HU (% LAA) of the lungs were measured using three-dimensional computed tomography in patients with COPD. WA and Ai were corrected by body surface area (BSA).
   Results: Forty-two clinically stable patients with COPD were enrolled. The median (range) mMRC dyspnea scale was 2 (0-3). The mMRC dyspnea scale score was significantly correlated with WA/BSA of fifth-and sixth-generation bronchi (Spearman correlation coefficient rho = 0.386, rho = 0.012;.= 0.484, rho = 0.001, respectively). Partial rank correlation analysis showed that the mMRC dyspnea scale score was significantly correlated with WA/BSA of sixth-generation bronchi, independent of the confounding factors of age, body mass index, % predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 s, % LAA, and Ai/BSA (rho=0.481, p=0.003). However, the % LAA and Ai/BSA were not correlated with this dyspnea scale.
   Conclusion: Bronchial WA assessed by three-dimensional computed tomography may be used as an assessment tool for dyspnea in patients with COPD.

AB Pulmonary infections are frequent complications in abdominal solid-organ transplantation (aSOT) which may threaten patient and allograft survival. Accurate diagnosis and treatment of pulmonary infections in this population can be challenging. Immunosuppressive therapy not only increases the risk of acquiring opportunistic and non-opportunistic infections, but it also impairs the inflammatory responses associated with microbial invasion which in an otherwise normal host produce clinical and radiologic responses that allow for early identification of the offending pathogen. Serologic testing is not a reliable diagnostic modality. Direct microbiological sampling is often necessary to make a definitive diagnosis early in the clinical course to optimize timely, targeted therapy while reducing the risk of developing antimicrobial resistance, and minimize adverse effects of therapy, if any. Fiber-optic bronchoscopy (FOB) with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) or transbronchial lung biopsy (TBB) offers such diagnostic advantage and possesses a potential therapeutic value too. This comprehensive review discusses the potential benefits of FOB alongside its risks and complications, indications and contraindications, and techniques. Additionally, the essay highlights FOB's utility and yield specifically with regard to type and timing of infections in aSOT patients.

AB Anxiety is a highly prevalent psychological comorbidity in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and has detrimental effects on pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) outcomes. It has been suggested that disease-specific fears could play an even more important role in COPD patients' disease progression. However, little is known about how different disease-specific fears impact COPD. This study examined how different disease-specific fears relate to different PR outcome measures in COPD patients and how these relationships evolve over the course of PR. Before and after a 3-week inpatient PR program, COPD patients (N = 104) underwent a 6-min walking test to measure functional exercise capacity. Disease-specific fears (fear of physical activity, fear of dyspnea, fear of disease progression, fear of social exclusion) were assessed with the COPD-Anxiety-Questionnaire-Revised. Health-related quality of life (HQoL), COPD health status, dyspnea in daily life, depression, and anxiety were measured using validated questionnaires. Multiple regression showed that greater disease-specific fears at the start of PR were associated with worse functional exercise capacity, HQoL, health status, and depression at the start and end of PR (controlling for age, sex, lung function, smoking status, and general anxiety). Patients who showed a stronger decrease in disease-specific fears improved more in PR outcome measures over the course of PR. Furthermore, different disease-specific fears were related to different PR outcome measures. The results show that disease-specific fears are associated with treatment outcome measures, both cross-sectionally and prospectively. Therefore, disease-specific fears should be addressed in COPD patients as they might play a significant role in disease progression.

AB Background: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a progressive lung disorder in which airflow is obstructed. Viral or bacterial upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs) may lead to exacerbations. Homeopathic medication administration to COPD patients during the influenza-exposure period may help to reduce the frequency of common URTIs.
   Methods: This prospective, observational, multicenter study was carried out in Cantabria, Spain. Patients with COPD were divided into two groups: group 1 received conventional treatment + homeopathic medication (diluted and dynamized extract of duck liver and heart; Boiron) (OG); group 2 received conventional treatment only (CG). The primary endpoint was the number of URTIs between the 4-5 months follow up (mean 4.72 +/- 0.96) from basal to last visit. Secondary endpoints included the duration of URTIs, number and duration of COPD exacerbations, use of COPD drugs, changes in quality of life (QoL), compliance, and adverse events (AEs).
   Results: 219 patients were analyzed (OG = 109, CG = 110). There was a significant reduction in mean number of URTIs during the follow-up period in OG compared to CG (0.514 +/- 0.722 vs. 1.037 +/- 1.519, respectively; p = 0.014). Logistic regression analysis showed a 3.3-times higher probability of suffering = 2 URTI episodes in CG (p = 0.003, n = 72). OG patients having >= 1 URTI also had a significant reduction in mean URTI duration per episode (3.57 +/- 2.44 days OG vs. 5.22 +/- 4.17 days CG; p = 0.012). There was no significant difference in mean number of exacerbations, mean duration of exacerbations, or QoL between OG and CG. There was a greater decrease in proportion of patients using corticosteroids for exacerbations between baseline and visit 2 in OG compared to CG (22.1% vs. 7.5% fewer respectively, p = 0.005). Exacerbator phenotype patients had a significant decrease in number of URTIs (0.54 +/- 0.72 vs. 1.31 +/- 1.81; p = 0.011), and fewer COPD exacerbations (0.9 +/- 1.3 vs. 1.5 +/- 1.7; p = 0.037) in OG vs. CG, respectively.
   Conclusions: Homeopathic medication use during the influenza-exposure period may have a beneficial impact at reducing URTIs' number and duration in COPD patients and at reducing the number of COPD exacerbations in patients with the exacerbator phenotype. Further studies are needed to confirm the effects observed in this study.

Underlying interstitial lung disease (ILD) diagnoses and baseline demographic and clinical characteristics were collated and assessed for predictors of comparative survival.
   Results: In this retrospective cohort, 179 CPFE patients were identified and categorized as 58 usual interstitial pneumonia/idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (UIP/IPF) (32%), 42 secondary ILD (23%), and 79 unclassifiable ILD (44%). The most prevalent (47%) radiologic pattern was 'unclassifiable', followed by 'consistent' and 'possible' UIP pattern in 38%. Adjusted predictors of mortality for the cohort as a whole included age (HR 1.03[1.01-1.06], P = 0.002), percent predicted diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide (unit HR 0.97 [0.96-0.99], P = 0.001), honeycombing (HR 1.58 [1.02-2.43], P = 0.04), and right ventricular dysfunction (HR 2.28 [1.39-3.97], P = 0.002). Survival was similar between CPFE with secondary ILD and CPFE with UIP/IPF, while CPFE with unclassifiable ILD had better comparative survival (Log rank = 0.026).
   Conclusions: Our findings suggest only about a third of CPFE patients represent suspected UIP/IPF; the majority were clinically and radiologically unclassifiable ILD whose survival was comparatively better. Identifiable or secondary causes of lung fibrosis in CPFE occurred in about a fifth of presenting patients.

TI Comparison of ERS'93 to the newly published GLI'17 reference values for
   carbon monoxide transfer factor

   values
ID SPIROMETRY
AB Background: The new predicted values for the carbon monoxide transfer factor (TL, CO) for Caucasians by the Global Lung Function Initiative are available since September 2017. Several authors have previously shown that the predicted values of Cotes et al. (ERS'93), overestimated TL, CO. However, the GLI'17 authors omitted to compare their predicted values with the ERS'93 equations, still in use throughout Europe.
   We present the differences between the two sets of predicted values, and in an attempt to improve the readability, used the contour plots instead of the classical 2-dimensional representations.
   Methods: Predicted values were computed for males and females for ages between 18 and 70 years and heights between 155 and 180 cm using Matlab software with increments of one unit (1 yr, 1 cm).
   Results: We demonstrate that GLI-'17 predicted values of TL, CO are systematically lower than those of ERS-'93, but also that the magnitude of the differences varies according to age, height and sex. More specifically, differences increase in both males and females by decreasing age and height, reaching up to 16% in males and 24% in females.
   Conclusion: The predicted values of TL, CO by Cotes at al. are systematically larger than the new GLI' 17 values. Plotting all the possible differences between predicted variables using contour graphs allows to identify the groups of subjects in whom significant changes in their predicted values will occur. Our findings should prompt physicians to investigate how switching to GLI-17 equations affects the clinical interpretation of TL, CO measurements in a real-live setting.

AB Introduction: Restrictive spirometry pattern is an under-recognised disorder with a poor morbidity and mortality prognosis. We compared physical activity levels between adults with a restrictive spirometry pattern and with normal spirometry.
   Methods: Restrictive spirometry pattern was defined as a having post-bronchodilator FEV1/FVC >= Lower Limit of Normal and a FVC< 80% predicted in two population-based studies (ECRHS-III and SAPALDIA3). Physical activity was measured using the International Physical Activity Questionnaire. The odds of having low physical activity (< 1st study-specific tertile) was evaluated using adjusted logistic regression models.
   Results: Subjects with a restrictive spirometry pattern (n = 280/4721 in ECRHS, n = 143/3570 in SAPALDIA) reported lower levels of physical activity than those with normal spirometry (median of 1770 vs 2253 MET.min/week in ECRHS, and 3519 vs 3945 MET.min/week in SAPALDIA). Subjects with a restrictive spirometry pattern were more likely to report low physical activity (meta-analysis odds ratio: 1.41 [95% CI 1.07-1.86]) than those with a normal spirometry. Obesity, respiratory symptoms, co-morbidities and previous physical activity levels did not fully explain this finding.
   Conclusion: Adults with a restrictive spirometry pattern were more likely to report low levels of physical activity than those with normal spirometry. These results highlight the need to identify and act on this understudied but prevalent condition.

   Pulmonary function test
ID PULMONARY-FUNCTION; FORCED EXPIRATION; TRACHEOBRONCHOMALACIA;
   TRACHEOMALACIA; CT
AB Background: Tracheal collapse is a weakness of the tracheal wall leading to expiratory central airway collapse of more than 50% compared to inspiration. It has previously been discussed whether the collapsibility of the greater airways is a stable or a dynamic condition. Indeed, other well-known lung diseases such as asthma are characterized by dynamic changes with respect to pulmonary function indices. There are several different morphologies of the trachea related to collapsibility such as the crescent type and the saber-sheath type both involving the tracheal cartilage and excess dynamic airway collapse only involving the posterior membranous part of the trachea. Is the morphology of the trachea important for the course of the disease? The effect or adverse effects of inhaled corticosteroids are thought to play a role in the increasing incidence of the excess tracheal collapse. In this pilot study, we hypothesized that the excess collapsibility of the tracheal wall is dynamic.
   Methods: We prospectively examined 20 patients with excessive tracheal collapse on previous CT scans performed primarily due to bronchiectasis. A repeat CT scan was performed in order to evaluate the collapsibility. Before the repeat scan, patients were trained in maximal inspiration, expiration and breathholding. CT was performed in full inspiration and at end-expiration. Image assessment was performed on a dedicated CT workstation using standard lung window display settings. The percentage expiratory collapse based on cross sectional areas from carina to the thoracic inlet was calculated. Pulmonary function tests were performed and analysed in accordance with the American Thoracic Society and the European Respiratory Society guidelines.
   Results: Repeat CT scan were performed after 24 month +/-7.2. Six of the 20 participants (30%) were males. Mean age was 67 +/-11.3 years. Mean FEV1 was 83% of predicted, FVC 96.6 % of predicted and FEV1/FVC-ratio 71%. In 45% of the patients tracheal expiratory collapse improved (by more than 10%) based on percentage change in cross sectional areas in expiration compared to inspiration. 35% of patients showed disease progression with increased collapse and in 20% the collapsibility remained unchanged.
   Conclusion: We demonstrate that the collapsibility in a large fraction of the patients had actually improved at the follow up examination. We do not find any dependency of the change in collapsibility on the morphology of the trachea after end expiration, use of corticosteroid, or recurrent infections. In addition, no correlation between the changes in collapse and changes in the pulmonary function tests and the symptoms is observed.

AB Introduction: Fibrotic interstitial lung disease ( f-ILD) comprises a group of diseases with lung scarring and reduced life expectancy. The short time from diagnosis to death affects the patients' bereaved spouses, who risk developing prolonged grief. In Denmark palliative care is most often offered to cancer patients.
   Aim: We aimed to investigate the experience of spouses of f-ILD patients during the final stages of illness and up to the first year after the patient's death to investigate if palliative care could ease the transition and prevent PGD.
   Methods: Our study had a qualitative design triangulating in-depth interviews, field notes, participant diaries and the prolonged grief questionnaire PG-13. We included 20 spouses and applied thematic analysis. Initial coding was performed deductively according to the chronological stages of before, during and after the death of the patient. We subsequently coded inductively within the stages.
   Results: During the final days the spouses experienced emotional ambivalence shifting between hope, acceptance and despair. Factors affecting the spouses during the final hours were the timing, location, and process of death. After the patient's death the spouses experienced feelings of grief and optimism as they moved toward a new life on their own.
   Conclusions: Some of the factors affecting the spouses and potentially causing prolonged grief might be alleviated by offering palliative/supportive care and advance care planning to f-ILD patients and their family.

ID EPITHELIAL LINING FLUID; ENDOTHELIAL GROWTH-FACTOR
AB Background: Airway microvascular system participates in the airway inflammation that is central to the pathophysiology of inflammatory lung disorders.
   Objective: To examine the role of airway microvascular permeability on airway obstruction in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).
   Methods: We measured the airway microvascular permeability index (AMPI) separately in the central or peripheral airways using a bronchoscopic microsampling technique in 9 non-smokers, 18 smokers without COPD (10 former smokers and 8 current smokers), and 26 smokers with COPD (12 former smokers and 14 current smokers).
   Results: AMPI in the central airways was relatively low, and this index was comparable among the five groups. In contrast, AMPI in the peripheral airways was significantly higher in smokers with or without COPD compared with non-smokers. Moreover, AMPI in the peripheral airways was significantly higher in current smokers than in former smokers with COPD. Especially, AMPI in the peripheral airways, but not in the central airways, showed a significant correlation with the degree of airway obstruction in former or current smokers with COPD. However, AMPI in the peripheral airways was not correlated with the diffusing capacity of the lung in former or current smokers with COPD.
   Conclusion: Airway microvascular permeability in the peripheral airways is increased in patients with COPD, and is associated with the severity of airway obstruction. We may need to consider this characteristic feature as a target in any therapeutic strategy for the treatment of the disease.

AB Artificial recharge is an effective way to minimize dewatering-induced ground settlements in deep excavation. To ensure the success of a long-term recharge, it is necessary to redevelop recharge wells (i.e., pumping) periodically to prevent well clogging. Field measurements show that ground settlements will occur during the well redevelopment. This paper proposed a method referred to as the combined recharge to eliminate settlement during well redevelopment. In the proposed method, a row of recharge wells (AR well) is added at the side of the traditional recharge wells (PR wells) to compensate water loss due to PR well redevelopment. Two field tests (with and without use of combined recharge) are conducted to investigate the ground response to recharge and redevelopment. Test results show that building settlements will increase progressively during redevelopment for case without combined recharge. However, there are no significant surface settlements during redevelopment for the case with combined recharge.

AB Spatiotemporal variability, teleconnection, and predictability of the Korean precipitation related to large scale climate indices were examined based on leading patterns of observed monthly Rx5day and total precipitation through an empirical orthogonal teleconnection (EOT). Cross-correlation and lag regression analyses for the leading modes and global atmospheric circulation dataset were employed on a monthly basis. The spatial pattern of the leading EOT modes for Rx5day and total precipitation represents a northern inland mode for boreal summer and a southern coastal mode in boreal winter. The temporal evolution of the leading EOT modes exhibits increasing trends during summer season and decadal variability for winter season. The leading EOT patterns of Rx5day precipitation show more widespread coherent patterns than those of total precipitation during warm and cold seasons, while the former explains less variance in precipitation variability than the latter. The tropical ENSO forcing has a coherent teleconnection with September and November-December precipitation patterns, while the Indian Ocean dipole is identified as a driver for precipitation variability in September and November. The monsoon circulation over the western North Pacific also exhibits a significant negative correlation with winter precipitation EOTs, while tropical cyclone indices are positively correlated with the fall precipitation EOTs. The leading patterns of the September and December Rx5day precipitation time series are predictable at up to six month lead time from the tropical Pacific sea surface temperatures (SSTs), while a somewhat weak predictable response from Indian Ocean SSTs was only detected at longer lead times. In addition, predictability from the Pacific SSTs for above normal precipitation is greater than that for below normal precipitation.

AB Hydrologic models are important for effective water resources management. They vary in complexity from parsimonious, spatially lumped, to physically-based, fully distributed models, which are generally expected to outperform the former. Wide applications of complex models are limited due to high data and computational demands. Therefore, a new approach based on well-balanced model complexity is needed to obtain reasonable simulation results with low data requirements. This paper presents a novel 3DNet-Catch hydrologic model, developed to represent key processes in sloped catchments under a temperate climate with modest data requirements. 3DNet-Catch includes runoff simulations within computational units by employing the interception, snow and soil routines, as well as runoff and channel routing. The soil routine, which is the key model feature, combines the SCS-CN method, an analytically integrated nonlinear outflow equation and the Brooks-Corey relation for unsaturated conductivity in an innovative manner. To advance runoff routing in 3DNet-Catch, an approach for analytical integration of the linear and nonlinear outflow equations is implemented. Most model parameters are physically meaningful, thus facilitating model calibration. The model structure can be adjusted according to soil and groundwater flow data, and it can include hydraulic structures, thereby providing adaptability to local conditions. A comprehensive hydrologic evaluation framework is established and conducted to examine whether 3DNet-Catch is adequately parameterised and can accurately reproduce catchment hydrologic response. The model parameterisation is evaluated by sensitivity, identifiability and correlation analyses. Model efficiency is quantified in terms of performance measures, hydrologic signatures and plausibility of the simulated hydrological processes. The results show high sensitivity of the hydrologic variables and performance measures to the model parameters, particularly to those of the soil routine. The parameters are uncorrelated and generally well identifiable. The model performs equally well in the calibration and evaluation periods. High efficiency in the hydrological signatures related to the soil routine indicates its robustness. The results, therefore, suggest that 3DNet-Catch is a comprehensively parameterised, versatile hydrologic model. It realistically reproduces observed hydrographs with modest data requirements, thus being appropriate for both engineering applications and investigative catchment dynamics studies.

AB Operations of amount of large and medium reservoirs have remarkably changed runoff and sediment loads, and consequently affected the fluvial processes intensively on the upper Yellow River. In this study, time series of runoff and sediment transport rates of four major hydrological stations on the upper Yellow River were used to analyze temporal and spatial variations of runoff and sediment loads. Mann-Kendall test and wavelet analysis were applied to analyze the datasets. Temporal variations in runoff and sediment loads were discerned in terms of changing trend, abrupt change year, and multi-periods from the time series. Additionally, a time series of runoffs was reconstructed based on a modeling scenario removing impact of reservoir impoundment and water diversion to indicate the status without human disturbances. Comparison of the measured and reconstructed datasets was conducted to evaluate the impact of reservoir impoundment and water diversion on hydrological variations. The measured runoff and sediment loads showed obvious decreasing trends due to impoundment and water diversion. However, the reconstructed runoffs regarded as only affected by climate change showed no significant changing trend at a 95% confidence level, confirming that, instead of climate change, human activities played the most important roles in variations. The measured datasets indicated that the reservoir construction and operation caused an abrupt change in runoff in 1986, while the reconstructed datasets indicated another abrupt change in 1995. Wavelet transform analysis distinguished the multi-periodical features of the time series. The first, second, and third dominant periodicities of the measured runoffs were 25-27, 16, and 8 years, respectively, whereas the first three dominant periodicities of the reconstructed runoffs were 26-31, 12, and 7 years, respectively. It was indicated that the high-frequency periodicities of runoffs decreased while the low-frequency periodicities increased, owing to reservoir impoundment and water diversion.

AB Water Sensitive Urban Design (WSUD) stormwater systems, also known as Low Impact Development (LID) systems or Nature Based Solutions (NBS), are currently implemented based on the underlying assumption of statistical stationarity of rainfall, which threatens to become outdated under climatic uncertainty. This paper applies a new downscaling method to examine the implications of climate change on future rainfall and evaluate the reliability of WSUD stormwater infrastructure in pollution reduction, flow frequency mitigation and reliability as an alternative water supply. A variety of future atmospheric scenarios are considered as part of this comprehensive assessment by analysing an ensemble of eight different downscaled General Circulation Models (GCMs). High resolution catchment-scale rainfall projections for Melbourne, Australia were generated using a scheme called High-resolution Downscaling of Rainfall Using STEPS (HiDRUS) at a fine 1 km and 6-min scale for more precise analysis with uncertainty estimates. Statistical analyses show that, in general, the climate models predict a drier future with fewer rainfall events and longer dry periods when comparing the simulated near future (2040-2049) periods against the base-line period (1995-2004). The difference simulated between historical and future rainfall projections show minimum difference of WSUD performance in pollution removal and flow frequency reduction, with slightly lower harvesting reliability ( < 3%) observed under future climate; high variabilities, however, were observed across GCM simulations, indicating big uncertainties of system reliability under various conditions, e.g. design wetland sizes may vary from 2.5% to 4.0% of the impervious catchment area according to different future projects across GCMs. Larger WSUD systems are recommended to ensure reliable performance of pollution removal, as well as harvesting reliability under simulated future conditions. The significance of considering an ensemble of different GCMs as opposed to many scenarios generated by a single 'best' climate model was also demonstrated for the robust estimation of uncertainty in future WSUD reliability. This work highlights important considerations for the future design, management and quantitative evaluation of WSUD reliability.

AB Regionalization methods have been extensively discussed as the solution for runoff predictions in ungauged basins (PUB), especially during the PUB decade (2003-2012). At the same time, research topics relevant to climate change appear to be an essential and attractive field for hydrologists in recent decades, because the availability and quality of water resources are strongly affected by climate change. However, it is still unknown whether regionalization methods can be used to predict hydrological impacts of climate change for ungauged catchments or how much uncertainty of future predictions may result from the use of regionalization methods. Therefore, in this study, we investigate the transferability of regionalization methods (i.e. spatial proximity and physical similarity methods, regression method) under changing climate conditions and compare the uncertainty resulting from regionalization methods with that from using climate models. The investigation is based on 108 catchments in Norway, with large variability in climate conditions and geographic characteristics. The study applies a lumped conceptual rainfall-runoff model (WASMOD) with simple structure and six model parameters. Our result shows that (a) the differences in the predictions by the regionalization methods tend to increase in the future, (b) the physical similarity method with parameter option (i.e. the model parameters from the physically-similar donor catchments are first averaged and then used to run the model for the target catchment) shows higher transferability than other methods, (c) the uncertainty contributions from climate models and regionalization methods to future runoff prediction are basin dependent, and (d) the uncertainty of future runoff prediction due to regionalization methods can be higher than that from climate models in low precipitation areas. This study provides insight to the choice of regionalization methods under changing climate conditions and the role of regionalization methods to the uncertainty contributions in future runoff predictions.

AB In the United States, fluvial flood risk is managed by the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP), which delineates areas that have a 1% chance of flooding each year (i.e. the 100-year floodplain). Development within and adjacent to riverine floodplains exacerbates flood losses by increasing peak discharge and runoff volume, shortening the time to peak, and altering the extent of the floodplain. This paper improves understanding of how future development can alter the 100-year floodplain in a watershed in Houston, TX through land use projection, hydrologic and hydraulic modeling, and implements a novel method for considering the impact of both regional trends in development and site-scale development policies on runoff response. The methodology presented in this paper integrates future development scenarios from a machine learning land use projection model with distributed hydrologic modeling and coupled 1D/2D unsteady hydraulic modeling to produce future floodplain estimates. Current site-scale detention requirements are represented within the hydrologic model to evaluate the regional effectiveness of these policies under future development conditions in 2050. Results indicate that the 100-year floodplain can expand by up to 12.5% across the watershed as a result of projected development in 2050 using current stormwater mitigation policies, and the number of parcels within the floodplain can increase by up to 18.8%. This study demonstrates how incremental land use changes can significantly alter the reality of flood risk in urbanizing watersheds, and how existing land use policies may be insufficient to mitigate impacts from future development.

AB The water resources-water environment carrying capacity (WR-WECC) is an important indicator for judging the regional macro-control ability of water resources. The nature-based solutions (NBS) concept is related closely to sustainability, harmonious and green development, resources rational exploitation, coupled human and environment, and ecological protection priority. Participatory water management has necessitated the formation of village water resources committees and/or village environmental committees; while in the case of water management, a participatory approach has resulted in the formation of community water association, domestic water committees, cooperative societies, and various water user groups. The WR-WECC evaluation goal is to find the most appropriate water resources development and utilization to maximize benefits and system efficiency while minimizing costs and trade-offs. To realize the development and utilization of water resources, water ecological conservation, and water environment protection in Yuetang District, we constructed a dynamic evaluation index system including water resources, water environment and water ecological characteristics, applying the principal component analysis (PCA) method to evaluate the temporal scale variation tendency of WR-WECC, and explore a deep-seated reason based on NBS. The WR-WECC evaluation index system covered 16 indexes belonging to three subsystems of water resource, socioeconomic, and eco-environmental systems. We used Statistical Product and Service Solutions (SPSS) 19.0 software and adopted the improved PCA to integrate the urban economic-social-ecological development of the Xiangjiang (a tributary of the Yangtze River) River Basin. We applied the evaluation index system to analyse the trend variability of WR-WECC of Yuetang District from 2005 to 2015 based on NBS. The WR-WECC of Yuetang District was affected mainly by the urban sewage treatment rate, the water use amount per ten thousand Yuan gross domestic product (GDP), and per capita water resources. In addition to minor fluctuations in 2007 and 2011, the WR-WECC in Yuetang District was generally on the rise year by year and was related to socioeconomic development level, regional water environment comprehensive management, and awareness of water ecological protection. The WR-WECC of the Yuetang District in 2013-2015 was in a Class I (excellent) condition. The temporal variations analysis based on NBS was proposed through a combination of economic-social-ecological values provided by nature-based development and utilization patterns. Based on the relationship among regional water resources, economic society, and eco-environment protection, the paper supplied a WR-WECC improvement strategy that was suitable for the development and utilization of water resources in a water-rich area in south China.

AB Pumping stations (PSs) are common regulation facilities in a water distribution system, with complex hydraulic characteristics and hydraulic parameters. In this study, a data assimilation-based approach was proposed for the correction of PS parameters, in which a 1D hydrodynamic model with PS inner boundary was established, and then the Ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) framework was used to correct PS parameters. In EnKF framework, the combination of the PS parameters was considered as the state vector, and water levels and discharge as observation vectors. The 1D hydrodynamic model was taken as the observation operator that constructs the mapping relationship between the state and the observation vector. The method's reliability was demonstrated through the case of Niantou PS in the middle route of South-North Water Transfer Project. Verification results show that the proposed method can accurately inverse PS parameters. Compared with the simulation results using PS parameters based on physical model experiments, the PS parameters corrected by the data assimilation method can greatly improve the accuracy of the hydrodynamic simulation. This data assimilation-based method can be used for parameter inversion of other complex hydraulic structures.

AB A unified pipe-network-based numerical manifold method (NMM) is developed to simulate immiscible two-phase flow in a geological medium. Both heterogeneous and non-heterogeneous geological media can be discretized as numerical pipe networks, which have high efficiency and accuracy in simulating fluid and mass transfer in fractured rock masses. A manifold element method is developed to solve the governing equations of immiscible two-phase flow in pipes. The developed NMM can simulate moving and deforming of two-phase flow interface. A grid-based front-tracking method updates the marker points constructing the fluid interface explicitly in each time step. The effectiveness of the NMM is verified through analytical and finite element analysis. Parametric studies are conducted by simulating immiscible two-phase flows with various fluid properties in homogeneous and inhomogeneous geological conditions. The results show that the developed method can efficiently simulate the moving interface of two-phase flow in geological media, including effects such as "viscous fingering", a noteworthy phenomenon in enhanced oil recovery. When the mobility of the driving fluid is larger than that of the driven fluid, the inhomogeneity of the medium can cause the fluid interface to roughen, which increases over time during the process of two-phase flow. For the inverse situation, although the fluid interface remains rough, the roughness variation throughout the process is not prominent.

AB To determine the influence of the Mesozoic Yanshanian orogeny in East Asia on contemporaneous Sr isotopic evolution of seawater, we systematically investigated the weathering profile, riverbed sediment and stream water in mono-lithological small granitic watersheds of the Jiuhua Mountains, Anhui, eastern China. Analysis based on 190 samples from 1 to 2 samplings per month during an entire hydrological year, spanning July 2014 to June 2015, shows that the infra-annual change of Sr concentration is 10-70%, but Sr-87/Sr-86 ratios only exhibit a slight change (0.709148-0.710427). This result indicates that using single sampling data to evaluate the influence of chemical weathering on the Sr-87/Sr-86 ratio evolution of seawater may cause some deviations. The Sr-87/Sr-86 ratio in the small granitic watersheds of the Jiuhua Mountains is 0.709148-0.710427 with an average of 0.710021, which is significantly higher than the lowest value (0.7068, similar to 160 Ma) of seawater in the Phanerozoic. During and after this period, the East Asian continent experienced a strong tectonic event - Yanshanian orogeny and formed widespread Jurassic-Cretaceous igneous rocks, such as the Jiuhua Mountains granite in the Yangtze Block. The Yanshanian granites in several main tectonic units in China exhibit high radiogenic Sr characteristics. Combined with the evidence of enhanced chemical weathering during Late Jurassic-Early Cretaceous, the notable increase of the seawater Sr-87/Sr-86 ratio after 160 Ma may be related to the Yanshanian orogeny in East Asia.

AB Mountainous regions are important sources of freshwater. Measurement of actual evapotranspiration (ET) is difficult to obtain in high mountain regions because of the harsh natural environment, and potential ET (PET) is therefore a suitable term to describe the atmospheric water demand of land surfaces under given meteorological conditions in those high elevation areas. In situ measured meteorological data were collected in 2015 and 2016 from five meteorological stations at various elevations from 2980 m to 4484 m in the Qilian Mountains, northwestern China, and the meteorological factors changed markedly with elevation. PET calculated with the Penman method showed a significant elevational gradient, and decreased as the elevation increased. The sensitivity analysis indicated that over the whole period, PET in the research region was most sensitive to net radiation (RN), followed by relative humidity (RH), air temperature (T), wind speed (WS) and soil heat flux (G). When RN was positive, the sensitivity of PET to RN decreased as the elevation increased, and when RN was negative, the sensitivity increased as the elevation increased. When T was above 0 degrees C, the sensitivity of PET to T decreased as the elevation increased, and when T was below 0 degrees C, the sensitivity increased as the elevation increased. The higher the elevation, the greater the sensitivity of PET to both RH and WS. The topographic shading in mountainous regions affected meteorological factors, PET and its sensitivity to meteorological factors in those high elevation areas. The RN was relatively small at the sites with topographic shading because of the reduction in solar radiation, and resulted in less sensitivity of PET to RN and greater sensitivity of PET to other meteorological factors. This study can help us to understand PET in the Qilian mountains and in other mountain regions from which meteorological data are difficult to obtain and very sensitive to climate change.

AB Projections of future changes in hydroclimatic variables are available through various general circulation models (GCMs) that are part of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5). Assessment of the performance of these models in simulating past climate, both individually and as an ensemble, has received much attention and is commonly the first step in assessing their suitability of application. In this study, we have evaluated the ability of various ensemble models to simulate past temperature and precipitation in the Gulf Basin region of North America, chosen as an illustrative case study. We have developed ensembles from 34 CMIP5 GCMs using six diverse approaches, including random forest, support vector regression, neural networks, linear regression, and weighted k-nearest neighbors, and compared the performance of the ensembles with each other and the individual GCMs using a robust set of metrics and nonparametric tests. For temperature, random forest outperforms all other ensembles and the best-performing GCM by a statistically significant margin and is able to simulate temporal and spatial patterns in temperature well. None of the ensembles are able to adequately simulate observed precipitation patterns in the study area, likely due to spatial differences in precipitation drivers in the region, as well as the coarseness of the dataset itself. However, the random forest, support vector regression, neural network, and linear regression ensembles achieved statistically significant improvements to precipitation simulation, as compared to the individual GCMs and the simple arithmetic mean ensemble, which has been used in several studies.

AB Assessing the sensitivity of groundwater systems to hydroclimate variability is critical to sustainable management of the water resources of Guam, US territory. We assess spatial and temporal variability of isotopic and geochemical compositions of vadose and phreatic groundwater sampled from cave drip sites and production wells, respectively, to better understand the vulnerability of the freshwater lens on Guam to variability in hydroclimate. We independently evaluate the existing conceptual model of the Northern Guam Lens Aquifer that is largely based on physical, as opposed to geochemical, observations. Sampling was conducted from 2008 to 2015, over which rainfall gradually increased. Major ion geochemistry and Sr isotope values of groundwater show varying influence from soil, limestone bedrock, and seawater. Geochemical modeling that can explain spatial variability in groundwater Na+ and Mg2+ concentrations and Sr/Ca and Sr-87/Sr-86 values indicates that groundwater compositions are dominantly controlled by mixing of freshwater with seawater and water-rock interaction. Differences between amount-weighted annual average precipitation delta O-18 values and groundwater delta O-18 values indicate a recharge bias toward the wet season, consistent with other tropical carbonate island aquifer settings. Infra- and inter-annual variations in Na+ concentrations and delta O-18 values in groundwater reflect sensitivity of recharge to seasonal variations in rainfall amount and changes in annual rainfall amounts. Our results indicate the influence of multiple modes of recharge on groundwater compositions and spatial variability in the sensitivity of groundwater to seawater mixing. This sensitivity of the freshwater lens points to the vulnerability of groundwater resources to changes in recharge associated with climate, land-use change, and increases in population.

AB Monthly streamflow time series are highly non-linear. How to improve forecast accuracy is a great challenge in hydrological studies. A lot of research has been conducted to address the streamflow forecasting problem, however, few methods are developed to make a systematic research. The objective of this study is to understand the underlying trend of streamflow so that a regression model can be developed to forecast the flow volume. In this paper, a hybrid streamflow forecast framework is proposed that integrates factor analysis, time series decomposition, data regression, and error suppression. Correlation coefficients between the current streamflow and the streamflow with lags are analyzed using autocorrelation function (ACF), partial autocorrelation function (PACE), and grey correlation analysis (GCA). Support vector regression (SVR) and generalized regression neural network (GRNN) models are integrated with seasonal and trend decomposition to make monthly streamflow forecast. Auto-regression and multi-model combination error correction methods are used to ensure the accuracy. In our experiments, the proposed method is compared with a stochastic autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) streamflow forecast model. Fourteen models are developed, and the monthly streamflow data of Shigu and Xiangjiaba, China from 1961 to 2009 are used to evaluate our proposed method. Our results demonstrate that the integrated model of grey correlation analysis, Seasonal-Trend Decomposition Procedure Based on Loess (STL), Support Vector Regression (GCA-STL-SVR) exhibits an improved performance for monthly streamflow forecast. The average error of the proposed model is reduced to less than one-tenth in contrast to the state-of-the-art method and the standard deviation is also reduced by more than 30%, which implies a greater consistency.

AB This study employs a systematic literature review to investigate how insurance data can be applied in the analysis of Surface Water Flood events. The study firstly identifies the variables expressing insurance data and those explaining them, together with their interrelationships. Damage variables may be expressed as either monetary-based or number of claims-based. Explaining variables may be subdivided into four categories: meteorological, geographic, demographic and property/building-based. Most of the common and under-researched combinations of these variables and their expression are discussed. Secondly, a comparative analysis is presented of current models, highlighting their differences and similarities. The study demonstrates that the scope and approach of the models varies in relation to scale, the coverage and period of incorporated insurance claims, and the methods used for model development and validation. Thirdly, the study proposes a generic and adaptable framework, constructed from an aggregation of information contained in relevant literature, to define a work-flow for model development and future deployment. The study concludes with a discussion of the challenges facing model development and opportunities for deployment.

AB We investigate the ability to improve flood inundation forecasts at short- to medium-range (1-7 days) timescales through weather ensembles and statistical water surface elevation (WSE) postprocessing. To generate the flood inundation forecasts, a one-dimensional hydraulic model, namely the Hydrologic Engineering Center's River Analysis System (HEC-RAS), is coupled to a regional hydrological ensemble prediction system (RHEPS). The RHEPS is comprised of: i) hydrometeorological observations; ii) weather ensembles from the National Centers for Environmental Prediction Global Ensemble Forecast System Reforecast version 2 (GEFSRv2); and iii) Hydrology Laboratory Research Distributed Hydrologic Model (HL-RDHM) as the hydrological model. The coupled RHEPS-hydraulic system is evaluated along the tidal Delaware River near the City of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, U.S. For the evaluation, emphasis is placed on the tidal-riverine transitional zone of the Delaware River and the downstream propagation of hydrometeorological uncertainty through the flood inundation forecasts. The coupled system is used to generate hourly flood inundation forecasts at lead times from 1 to 7 days, over the period 2008-2013. Additionally, WSEs from the coupled system are statistically postprocessed using quantile regression (QR). Results show that the raw flood inundation ensemble forecasts exhibit higher skill than the deterministic ones. We also find that statistical postprocessing improves the skill of the raw flood inundation ensemble forecasts, with greater improvements at the longer lead times (> 3 days). Overall, we find that both weather ensembles and statistical WSE postprocessing can be used to enhance the skill of flood inundation forecasts at short- to medium-range timescales. In turn, this may serve to enhance the spatial representation of flood forecasts several days in advance, which could contribute in the future to making flood forecast communication and warnings more effective.

AB Recent significant channel evolution in the Jingjiang Reach has raised much attention, particularly the remarkable bank erosion. A coupled model for simulating bed deformation and bank erosion has been proposed in this study, which focuses on the erosion of the bank with a composite structure in the Lower Jingjiang Reach. In order to cover three contributing processes that may interact with each other, the proposed model integrates a one-dimensional morphodynamic module with a two-dimensional module of ground water flow and a bank erosion module for the cantilever failure of a composite riverbank. Model performance was evaluated through a detailed simulation of channel evolution along a 150.8-km subreach in the Jingjiang Reach over the 2005 hydrological year. Satisfying results were obtained from the simulation, showing relatively close agreement between the calculations and measurements in terms of hydrological data at the outlet section, bank erosion sites, longitudinal channel profile and typical cross-sectional profiles. In addition, investigations into temporal changes in bank soil properties and critical overhanging width at cantilever failure demonstrate that there was a seasonal variation in the volumetric water content of bank soil, which increased during the rising and flood periods and then decreased during the recession period, showing an impact on the occurrence timing of cantilever failures. The tensile strength and critical overhanging width had an inverse relationship with the water content, whereas the critical width sharply increased and then decreased during high flows affected by a rapid change in river stage. The temporal distribution of cantilever failure events indicates that cantilever failure primarily occurred in the flood and recession periods. The effects of bed roughness, water content variation and secondary flow on bank erosion were also discussed.

AB Assessing flood frequency is pivotal for hydrology, with implications for many fields ranging from river science to the insurance industry. Reservoir regulation may alter the characteristics of the flood frequency distribution function. This paper incorporates reservoir impacts as an inherent variable to derive an analytical solution of outflow peaks and proposes new flood frequency distributions. Steps are as follows: (1) the original flood without reservoir impacts is assumed to follow a Pearson type III distribution, (2) linear and nonlinear reservoir models, including numerical integration and triangular area calculation methods, are proposed to simulate the relationships between inflow and outflow peaks, and (3) the flood frequency distributions resulting from reservoir impacts are derived. Derived equations are applied to the Shuibuya and Wuqiangxi reservoirs in China. Results show that: (1) although the numerical integration method with the nonlinear model is comparable with the reservoir flood routing, the triangle area calculation method with the nonlinear model is recommended for its accuracy and simplicity, (2) the reservoir regulation changes the flood frequency distribution function entirely in the nonlinear reservoir model, while only change the parameter in the linear reservoir model, and (3) downstream flood's CV can be increased or decreased, which depends on the reservoir regulating capacity. It is indicated that altering the parameters of the flood frequency distribution is not sufficient to characterize watershed under reservoir control. This paper proposes the analytical solution about inflow and outflow peaks, which can point out the possible changes in the watershed with reservoir construction in plan.

AB In porosity models for urban flooding, artificial porosity is used as a statistical descriptor of the urban medium. Buildings are treated as subgrid-scale features and, even with the use of relatively coarse grids, their effects on the flow are accounted for. Porosity models are attractive for large-scale applications due to limited computational demand with respect to solving the classical Shallow Water Equations on high-resolution grids. In the last decade, effective schemes have been developed that allowed accounting for a wealth of sub-grid processes; unfortunately, they are known to suffer from oversensitivity to mesh design in the case of anisotropic porosity fields, which are typical of urban layouts. In the present study, a dual porosity approach is implemented into a two-dimensional Finite Element numerical scheme that uses a staggered unstructured mesh. The presence of buildings is modelled using an isotropic porosity in the continuity equation, to account for the reduced water storage, and a tensor formulation for conveyance porosity in the momentum equations, to account for anisotropy and effective flow velocity. The element-by-element definition of porosities, and the use of a staggered grid in which triangular cells convey fluxes and continuity is balanced at grid nodes, allow avoiding undesired mesh-dependency. Tested against refined numerical solutions and data from a laboratory experiment, the model provided satisfactory results. Model limitations are discussed in view of applications to more complex, real urban layouts.

AB Diffusion is the dominating process in the migration of contaminants through landfill liners, below which the soils are generally unsaturated. Analytical method is often considered as a preferred approach over numerical method to solve diffusion problems. In this study, a one-dimensional diffusion model of contaminants is firstly developed to account for unsaturated properties of the soils beneath landfill barriers. Based on an assumption of linear water pressure distribution, the nonlinear governing equation in the diffusion model is transformed into a linear equation using an exponential expression of soil water retention curve and a linear model of unsaturated diffusion coefficient. Subsequently, the corresponding analytical solution is obtained and the solution is then applied to investigate the effects of soil type, water pressure condition and groundwater depth on the diffusion of contaminants. The analytical results show that groundwater depth has the most influential effect on the steady flux rate of contaminants. Furthermore, the obtained steady flux rates in soil layers with high desaturation rate are negligible when the groundwater depth exceeds 3 m and 2 m. The results also indicate that a thicker soil layer with high desaturation rate is recommended to be an effective diffusion barrier to mitigate the pollution of the underlying soils and groundwater.

AB Climate-induced disturbances are expected to increase in frequency and intensity and affect wetland ecology by altering its hydrology. Investigating how wetland hydrology responds to climate disturbances is an important first step to understand the ecological response of coastal wetlands to these disturbances. Wetland hydrologic resilience, the ability of wetland in absorbing disturbances and restoring to pre-disturbance conditions in hydrological function, is a critical measure of wetland hydrological response to climate disturbances. However, a practical methodology for quantifying wetland hydrologic resilience (HR) is still lacking. This study aimed to improve the approach for quantifying the hydrologic resilience of wetland ecosystems to climate variability and climate change. A set of quantitative metrics was developed including the variations of groundwater table, overland flow, and saltwater table. This approach was then applied to a coastal landscape that includes coastal-forested and herbaceous wetlands in North Carolina, USA. We investigated the threshold behaviors of groundwater table, overland flow, and saltwater table for a 20-year period (1995-2014) by applying a regional scale wetland hydrological model, Penn State Integrated Hydrological Model for wetland hydrology (PIHM-Wetland). We found that the multiscale variations of groundwater table under dry climatic conditions is a good indicator of wetland HR to drought. The variation of overland flow during rainfall events effectively quantified HR to wet periods. We also found that the variation of the water level of saltwater is an important metric of wetland HR to sea level rise. This study improves the methodology of quantifying wetland hydrologic resilience at a regional scale, representing an important first step towards understanding the wetland hydrological and ecological resilience to future intensified climate disturbances in coastal regions and beyond.

AB Hydropower production is altering the Mekong River basin's riverine ecosystems, which contain the world's largest inland fishery and provide food security and livelihoods to millions of people. The basin's hydropower reservoir storage, which may rise from similar to 2% of its mean annual flow in 2008 to similar to 20% in 2025, is attenuating seasonal flow variability downstream of many dams with integral powerhouses and large storage reservoirs. In addition, tributary diversions for off-stream energy production are reducing downstream flows and augmenting them in recipient tributaries. To help manage tradeoffs between dam benefits (hydropower, irrigation, flood control, domestic water supply, and navigation) and their consequences for livelihoods and ecosystems, we review observed and projected impacts on river flows along both the Mekong mainstream and its tributaries. We include the effects of diversions and inter-basin transfers, which prior reviews of flow alteration in the Mekong basin have largely neglected. We also discuss the extent to which concurrent changes in climate, water demand, and land use, may offset or exacerbate hydropower-induced flow alteration. Our major recommendations for assessing hydrological impacts in the Mekong and other basins undergoing rapid hydropower development include synchronizing and integrating observational and modeling studies, improving the accuracy of reservoir water balances, evaluating multi-objective reservoir operating rules, examining hydropeaking-induced flow alteration, conducting multi-dam safety assessments, evaluating flow indicators relevant to local ecosystems and livelihoods, and considering alternative energy sources and reservoir sedimentation in long-term projections. Finally, we strongly recommend that dam impact studies consider hydrological alteration in conjunction with fish passage barriers, geomorphic changes and other contemporaneous stressors.

AB A Lagrangean particle based transport model is introduced to calculate the potential contamination paths of solutes in drainage water in an urban area during a pluvial flood event. The necessity to capture the complexity of a surface runoff model and the coupling of pipe and surface are investigated. Results show that fully coupled hydrodynamic models are needed for a good representation of transport paths and breakthrough curves of contaminant concentration in drainage water. An analysis for time variation of a single location spill event is performed that shows a high variability in solute spreading depending on the spill relative to the rainfall characteristics.

AB The most uncertain parameter in determining the stage-discharge relationship of an ungauged stream is the friction factor, a parameter for which a gauged stream can be back-calculated using hydrometric survey data that has been compiled over a wide range of flow conditions. The existing friction factor models for ungauged streams that do not require hydrometric survey data as input can have very large prediction errors. In this study, 415 streamflow events collected from 52 rivers across three continents were assembled to allow for the use of a suitable global dataset size/range to develop a robust model for the prediction of the friction factor in ungauged streams using two machine learning algorithms (Gene Expression Programing (GEP) and Extreme Learning Machine (ELM)). The new GEP and ELM models outperformed existing models with significantly improved R-squared values of 0.76 and 0.78, respectively. The combination of the two input parameters (relative smoothness and the friction slope) allowed the new models to more accurately predict the friction factor for a wider range of streams and flow conditions. The forecasting uncertainty of the developed GEP and ELM models were compared with past models and found to be the least uncertain, with Width Uncertainty Band (WUB) values of +/- 0.0536 and +/- 0.0504, respectively. For the first time in this field of research, partial derivative sensitivity analysis was applied to the trends of the friction factor estimation by GEP and ELM. It was found that GEP and ELM models are extremely sensitive to friction slope in comparison with relative smoothness. The GEP and ELM model results for predicting the Darcy-Weisbach friction factor were compared with different existing relationships, and the superior performance of the proposed models was illustrated.

ID LEVEL TIME-SERIES; DISCHARGE ESTIMATION; LAPTEV SEA; IMAGERY; STAGE
AB Due to the rapid decline of in situ observations on river discharge in Arctic regions, evaluation of the continental freshwater input to the Arctic Ocean has become problematic and necessitates the development of alternative approaches based on remote sensing. Radar altimetric satellites have demonstrated high potential for estimation of river water discharge. Compared to polar orbiting altimeters, non-polar orbit satellites have an advantage in temporal sampling. Their greatest drawback, however, is spatial coverage: observations do not cover the low reaches of most parts of Arctic rivers. In this study of the Lena River, we demonstrate a way to overcome this limitation by using a combination of in situ observations from tributaries and satellite observations in the middle river reaches. The water discharge as well as monthly and annual water flow were evaluated using three virtual stations. Direct combination of the water level from these virtual stations was not possible because of the difference in seasonal amplitude. However, the combination of altimetric discharge from the three independently processed tracks significantly improves the flow retrievals. The accuracy of the monthly water flow estimates at the river outlet is 23%. It increases with the integration time giving 7% for annual flow.

We distinguish between the studies focusing on the flow in (i) a single street intersection, (ii) surface-sewer exchanges, (iii) an array of obstacles and (iv) quasi-realistic urban districts. We discuss the main flow processes which are covered in the various studies and detail which flow variables were recorded. This enables identifying flow processes for which comprehensive experimental datasets are available from those which require additional experimental research. We also highlight the typical ranges of scale factors used, which depend mainly on the extent of the studied area (from very local up to the district level). This review aims at helping computational modellers to pinpoint the most suitable dataset for validating their numerical approaches and laboratory modellers to identify gaps in current experimental knowledge of urban flooding.

AB This study mainly evaluated and compared satellite-based quantitative precipitation estimate products (QPEs) for the drought monitoring of mainland China. Two long-term (more than 30 a) satellite-based QPEs, i.e. the Precipitation Estimation from Remotely Sensed Information using Artificial Neural Networks-Climate Data Record (PERSIANN-CDR) and the Climate Hazards Group InfraRed Precipitation with Station (CHIRPS), and a short-term (18a) QPE, i.e. the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) Multi-Satellite Precipitation Analysis (TMPA) 3B42V7 are considered. Two widely used drought indices, the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) and the Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI), are chosen to evaluate the drought monitoring utility. The 3B42V7 was only evaluated with PDSI due to the short data records. The results show that all the three QPEs perform satisfactorily in the eastern part of China when using both SPI and PDSI. However, their performances for west China could not be clearly determined due to the sparse gauge networks. 3B42V7 features best performance among the three QPEs in the evaluation using PDSI. To further spatiotemporally evaluate the drought utility of the QPEs, four typical drought-affected regions, i.e. northeast China (NEC), Huang-Huai-Hai plain (3HP), southwest China (SWC), and Loess plateau (LP) were extracted from mainland China for specific case studies. Temporally, all three QPEs are able to detect the typical drought of the four regions with both SPI and PDSI, and 3B42V7 presents the least deviation in PDSI estimate. Spatially, both CHIRPS and 3B42V7 accurately catch the spatial centers and extent of the typical drought events, while PERSIANN-CDR could not match the spatial patterns of drought events well. Generally, the long-term PERSIANN-CDR and CHIRPS perform satisfactorily in drought detection and are suitable for drought utility; however, caution should be applied when studying the spatial variation of drought using PERSIANN-CDR. CHIRPS could also be suitable for near-real-time drought monitoring for its shorter time latency of data release. The short-term 3B42V7 also performs well in many cases, and has thus considerable potential for drought monitoring.

AB Carbonate weathering by CO2 is considered to play an important role in the global carbon cycle. In acid rain-affected areas, the carbon cycle can be impacted by acid rain weathering. When previous studies have considered all possible weathering processes including H2SO4 in rainfall, sulfide oxidation and agricultural activities, this study proposed a geochemical method to specifically calculate the extent of carbonate weathering by acid rain using hydrogeochemical data from karstic spring and rainfall. This method has considered the H concentration and nitrification of NH4 in rain during recharge, and provided the upper limit of the weathering amount. Seasonal sampling for spring (wet and dry season) was conducted from a typical carbonate area in Jiaoshi, Chongqing, SW China, with annual rain pH values ranging from 3.94 to 4.70. The major hydrogeochemistry types of spring are HCO3-Ca and HCO3-Ca center dot Mg. The average proportion of carbonate weathering by acid rain is estimated to be 36 +/- 15%. The quantitative geochemical method provided in this study is important for understanding the hydrogeochemical processes in acid rain areas and for calculating CO2 sources & sinks of carbonate weathering.

AB Forest growth dynamics affect streamflow with changes in actual evapotranspiration (AET) during forest regeneration. Using a "top-down" model approach, we present a seasonal forest hydrology model that estimates streamflow in forested catchments containing sparse soil and climate data. Across a 1423 km(2) remote study area, a rainfall interpolation procedure using available rainfall data and information on terrain was integrated into a new seasonal streamflow model, called ABCF, which uses catchment sapwood area (SA) as the emergent property that equilibrates with potential evapotranspiration (PET), and a soil storage threshold that reduces AET below PET when soil water is limiting. We produce seasonal estimates of streamflow with Nash Sutcliffe efficiencies of 0.85, 0.87, and 0.91 for three major catchments within the study area. A fundamental feature of the "top-down" model approach is the use of LiDAR data and forest inventory data to model forest structural properties that relate strongly with SA. Building on our previous work with this modelling framework, our representation of eco-hydrological properties of the forest has been refined with a more accurate procedure for estimating stand mean sapwood thickness, and hence SA, and a remotely sensed tree stocking density (N) of old-growth forests to correct the temporal evolution of N as a means to improve SA estimates. Regional consistency of model parameters shows that the "top-down" modelling framework may be used to estimate streamflow in ungauged catchments using a forest growth model. The seasonal model generalised for both water-limited and water-unlimited forest conditions has significant potential for application in water supply planning and drought security.

AB With intensifying climate change, droughts over Southwest China (SWC) are drawing increasing interest. The droughts of 2009-2011 have attracted special concern. However, the roles of atmospheric evaporative demand [reflected by reference evapotranspiration (ET0)] and precipitation (P) anomalies in drought evolutions are still unclear. To that end, we revisited the evolution of the 2009-2011 SWC meteorological droughts quantitatively and comprehensively by quantifying the ET0 and P impacts. In terms of three drought parameters [i.e., drought intensity (DI), area (DA), and duration (DD)], SWC experienced the second most severe drought of the 1961-2012 period in 2009. Evident differences existed among the drought conditions in different months, i.e., more severe droughts occurred in February-March 2009, September 2009 to March 2010, and June-October 2011. Based on the annual means over drought regions, the 2009 and 2011 DI (DA) could be attributed to lower P, but the P and ET0 impacts [P, ET0, and P-and-ET0(which reflects drought occurrence due to their combined impacts only)] were comparable in 2010. In addition, P reduction was responsible for DD during 2009-2011. Except in January-March, which were dominated mostly by P, DI (DA) was generally dominated by ET0 (ET0 or P-and-ET0) over the three years. While P dominated spatially and temporally for the majority of the 36 months for DI (DO), some areas were mainly affected by ET0 (ET0 or P-and-ET0). Therefore, to better understand drought evolutions and improve drought monitoring and forecasting, the impacts of ET0 anomalies should be fully considered. The results of this study provide an important reference framework for comprehensively understanding the underlying mechanisms of droughts not only in SWC but also in other regions around the world.

AB Salt dissolved in soil water is transported upward to the soil surface through capillary rise from shallow groundwater, leading to salt accumulation near the surface and salinization of wetlands in arid regions. However, it is not clear how the mechanism and feedback for evapotranspiration induces salt accumulation and precipitation. Here, we developed a model to simulate the transport of water, solutes, and heat, and measured the meteorological, hydrological, and hydraulic parameters of soil using field experiments to calibrate the model for riparian and saltmarsh wetlands in northwestern China. The results showed that the annual atmospheric precipitation averaged 125.3 +/- 10.2 mm in two types of wetlands, the evapotranspiration, depth to the groundwater and soil salinity averaged 587.7 nun yr(-1), 85.4 +/- 5.4 cm and 29.80 g kg(-1) in the riparian wetland, while 637.2 mmyr(-1), 129.7 +/- 15.1 cm and 63.64 g kg(-1) in the saltmarsh wetland, respectively. We found that the flux of liquid water, flux of water vapor, salinity, and efflorescence had maximum values of 1.23 mm day(-1), 0.22 mm day(-1), 104.16 g kg(-1), and 2.10 cm in the riparian wetland, respectively, versus 1.28 mm day(-1), 0.32 mm day(-1), 202.02 g kg(-1), and 3.70 cm in the saltmarsh wetland. Our simulations show that the salinity increases significantly with increasing evapotranspiration, soil temperature, saturated water content, and groundwater depth in the saltmarsh wetland, but that the effects of saturated water content and groundwater depth were small in the riparian wetland. As a result of these factors, the efflorescence pattern exhibited characteristic seasonal and inter-annual variability in which complex interactions among atmospheric precipitation, evapotranspiration, groundwater, and river water provided the long-term driving forces for water flow and salt transport. We found that the increasing efflorescence disrupted evaporation more than sub-florescence, which reduced the soil porosity and possibly affected water vapor transport.

AB For the last several decades, great efforts have been put into converting point precipitation into mean areal precipitation in the design of hydraulic and hydrologic infrastructures. The ratio between point and areal precipitation, called the Areal Reduction Factor (ARF), has been identified to vary significantly depending on a variety of factors, with some factors remaining to be undiscovered. In this paper, we highlight the influence of internal spatial variability of storms on the ARF value. For this, we employ a storm identification algorithm on the radar composite data to identify a total of 54,758 elliptically-shaped extreme storms over the six-year study period. Then, we investigate the relationship between the various storm characteristics to their ARF value. Our findings are as follow: First, we confirm a widely-accepted notion that ARF generally increases with the duration, and it is inversely related to the storm area. Second, we discover that spatial variability within storm, e.g., the coefficient of variation of radar image pixel rainfall values, is a very strong predictor of the ARF value along with area and duration. Last, the difference of ARF values between storms that have elliptical shapes and those that are circular over the same area is about 20% on average. These findings inform that the current design framework of areal rainfall estimation will be improved by incorporating the information on the rainfall spatial variability and storm shape.

AB Information for the interspecific variation in plant stemflow production may provide important implications for their survival in drought conditions. Our objectives were to determine if stemflow generation varied with plant species and to ascertain their possible responses to rainfall characteristics and plant morphology. Stemflow volume (SFv), stemflow depth (SFD), stemflow percentages of gross rainfall (SFD/GR), and funnelling ratio (FR, a quantitative index to evaluate water enrichment by stemflow) were quantified in 2014 and 2015 for coexisting two tree species (Pines tabulifomis and Armeniaca vulgaris) and two shrub species (Salix psammophila and Caragana korshinskii) on the Loess Plateau of China. The results indicated that the generation of stemflow varied significantly among the studied four species. The shrub species had larger values of SFv, SFD , and SFD/GR than tree species. FR values revealed that the soil at the plant bases for P. tabuliformis, A. vulgaris, S. psarrunophila, and C. korshinskii, could receive averages of 13.1-, 23.9-, 78.2-, and 124.9-fold more rainwater, respectively, than an equivalent open area. Characteristics of rainfall had a notable influence on stemflow production. Specifically, SFN, and SFD were all positively and linearly correlated with rainfall in 2014 and 2015. SFD/GR and FR increased linearly with rainfall in 2014, whereas increased exponentially or even decreased after reaching a rainfall threshold in 2015. Significant influence of plant morphology on stemflow production was only observed for P. tabuliformis but not for the other species. In conclusion, the studied two shrub species (S. psammophila and C. korshinskii) were morphologically more effective than the tree species (P. tabuliformis and A. vulgaris) in funnelling rainwater to the soil of the basal area. This could be eco-hydrologically significant for their survival in drought environments.

AB As one of the largest contiguous karst regions in the world, Southwest China is vulnerable to soil erosion because of its unique geology and inappropriate land use. Understanding the linkages between geological conditions, land cover patterns and sediment yield is thus of paramount importance to effectively control sediment delivery in heterogeneous karst watersheds. The objective of this study was to examine how the specific sediment yield was related to lithology and landscape variables for 40 karst watersheds in southwest China. Due to these watershed variables were highly codependent, partial least squares regression (PLSR) was applied to elucidate the relationship between the sediment yield and 30 lithology and landscape variables. The first-order controls were determined by calculating the variable importance for the projection (VIP). Predictors with VIP scores larger than 1 were considered to be the most influential predictors of the PLSR model. Results indicated that the lithology and landscape indeed exerted substantial influence on sediment yield (explained variance: 66.8%) for the investigated 40 watersheds. Specifically, the first dominant factor for sediment yield was karst coverage (VIP = 2.19), followed by dolomite coverage (VIP = 1.42), landscape shape index (VIP = 1.33), patch richness (VIP = 1.23), relative patch richness (VIP = 1.23), number of patches (VIP = 1.22), and Simpson's diversity index (VIP = 1.03). The PLSR technique enabled the elimination of codependency among the variables and facilitated a more unbiased view of the control factors for sediment yield. Therefore, this approach is recommended as a useful tool for identifying the dominant factors controlling sediment yield in heterogeneous karst watersheds.

AB A deterministic geometric approach, the fractal-multifractal (FM) method, is proposed to temporally downscale (disaggregate) rainfall and streamflow records. The applicability of the FM approach is tested on: (1) two sets of rainfall records-one from Laikakota, Bolivia and the other from Tinkham, Washington, USA; and (2) two distinct sets of streamflow records-for water years 2005 and 2008 from the Sacramento River, California, USA. For the purpose of validation, the available daily records are first aggregated into weekly, biweekly, and monthly records and then the FM method is applied to downscale such sets back into the daily scale. The results indicate that the FM method, coupled with a threshold to capture the high intermittency of rainfall and a smoothing parameter to get the milder texture of streamflow, readily generates daily series (over a year) based on weekly, biweekly, and monthly accumulated information, which reasonably preserves the time evolution of the records (especially for streamflow) and captures a variety of key statistical attributes (e.g., autocorrelation, histogram, and entropy). It is argued that the FM deterministic downscalings may enhance and/or supplement available stochastic disaggregation methods.

AB Monthly streamflow prediction can offer important information for optimal management of water resources, flood mitigation, and drought warning. The semi-humid and semi-arid Wei River Basin in China was selected as a case study. In this study, a modified empirical mode decomposition support vector machine (M-EMDSVM) model was proposed to improve monthly streamflow prediction accuracy. The accuracy was improved by introducing polynomial fitting to amend the error caused by the boundary effect existing in the counting process of empirical mode decomposition (EMD). Meanwhile, the computational process of the EMD was analyzed to confirm the decomposition method for the EMD. The root mean square errors, mean absolute error, mean absolute percentage error and Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient were adopted as the standards to evaluate the performance of the artificial neural network (ANN), SVM, WA-SVM, EMD-SVM, and M-EMDSVM models. Meanwhile, the performance of the M-EMDSVM model with different lengths of training dataset was compared and analyzed. Moreover, the monthly streamflow series with various non-stationary levels were simulated to investigate the prediction capacity of the M-EMDSVM model. Results indicated that: (1) the ANN model had the worst performance among the five models at all stations, whereas the EMD-SVM model performed better than the WA-SVM with better metric values; (2) for strong non-stationary series, the performance of the M-EMDSVM model was superior to the EMD-SVM; (3) for weak non-stationary series, the performance of the M-EMDSVM model was similar with the EMD-SVM. Generally, the findings of this study showed that more accurate prediction of strong non-stationary streamflow could be achieved using the proposed modified EMD-SVM model than single SVM model.

AB A fully three dimensional hydrodynamic implicit numerical algorithm has been proposed for simultaneous simulation of fluid density variation and water table gradient in saturated porous media. Unlike the most of the performed researches that primarily restricted to solute transport simulation in confined or unconfined aquifers without proceeding to forecast water table transient situation, the proposed model can truly handle corresponding problems in an unconfined aquifer having sharp water table gradient. The algorithm is based upon a staggered finite volume scheme on an unstructured triangular mesh in the plane and structured grid in vertical that solves the most general form of Darcy equation without limiting assumptions, not expressed as a function of the groundwater potential but presented in term of the water pressure. Avoiding the excessive computational efforts, an efficient and simple algorithm has been proposed to discretize flow equations, track the water table position and determine salinity distribution. A line iterative method has been utilized efficiently, in a way that, resultant linear equations system splits into a series of tri-diagonal square matrix systems whereby the direct together with iterative procedure employed simultaneously to achieve problem unknowns. Prediction of passive scalar salinity quantity has been achieved efficiently by employing the advantageous time splitting algorithm. This has allowed designing and applying different numerical schemes more compatible with the mathematical and physical properties of the corresponding phenomena. Performance of the 3D model has been validated against a range of problems. Comparison between numerical results, analytical solutions, and experimental data demonstrates that the model represents well the simultaneous effects of fluid density variation and water table gradient processes.

AB Many studies have shown that K+ has more favourable effects on soil water infiltration than Na+, which is a result of specific ion effects or Hofmeister effects. In this study, we employed four alkali metal cation species (Li+, Na+, K+, and Cs+) to determine how the particle interactions influence the water infiltration in a soil with permanent surface charges. Moreover, the defined Hofmeister energy was employed to characterize the specific ion effects. The DLVO force plus the hydration force between two adjacent soil particles mainly determines water infiltration rate through affecting the soil pore-size distribution, which exhibits strong specific ion effects. The hydration force may originate from the surface hydration of soil particles and the hydration of cations in the double layer. The hydration pressure between adjacent soil particles was complexly influenced by electrolyte concentration, Debye length, cationic distribution in the double layer through the Hofmeister energy of cation.

AB Various natural and anthropogenic factors affect the formation of gleyed soil. It is a major challenge to identify the key hazard factors and evaluate the dynamic evolutionary process of soil gleyization at a regional scale under future climate change. This study addressed this complex challenge based on regional groundwater modelling for a typical agriculture region located in the Ganjiang River Delta (GRD) of Poyang Lake Basin, China. We first implemented in-situ soil sampling analysis and column experiments under different water depths to examine the statistical relationship between groundwater depth (GD) and gleyization indexes including active reducing substance, ferrous iron content, and redox potential. Subsequently, a three-dimensional groundwater flow numerical model for the GRD was established to evaluate the impacts of the historical average level and future climate change on vadose saturation and soil gleyization (averaged over 2016-2050) in the irrigated farmland. Three climate change scenarios associated with carbon dioxide emission (A1B, A2, and B1) were predicted by the ECHAM5 global circulation model published in IPCC Assessment Report (2007). The ECHAM5 outputs were applied to quantify the variation of groundwater level and to identify the potential maximum gleyed zones affected by the changes of meteorological and hydrological conditions. The results of this study indicate that GD is an indirect indicator for predicting the gradation of soil gleyization at the regional scale, and that the GRD will suffer considerable soil gleyization by 2050 due to fluctuations of the water table induced by future climate changes. Compared with the annually average condition, the climate scenario B1 will probably exacerbate soil gleyization with an 8.8% increase in total gleyed area in GRD. On average, the highly gleyed areas will increase in area by 29.7 km(2), mainly on the riverside area, and the medium-slightly gleyed area will increase by 19.2 km(2) in the middle region.

AB Distributed physically based models (DPMs) have become the standard tool for urban drainage modelling. However, high computational demands limit these in applications where fast or multiple simulations are needed. This paper presents simple fit-for-purpose cheaper-to-run surrogate models (SMs) for pipe network simulations which are validated against a DPM. The SMs are set up by lumping the DPM network into compartments in which the volume of water is governed by mass balances. Outgoing discharges to downstream compartment(s) and surcharging are computed from unambiguous volume-discharge curves. The SMs are applied on a 45 km(2) catchment, Elster Creek in Melbourne, Australia. The number of simulated states and simulation times are reduced by approximately 3 and 6 orders of magnitude, respectively. Different SM complexities are examined. The simplest SM using steady state training data performed well with NSE of 0.98 for volume in the most upstream compartment. When emulating the aggregated surcharge from that compartment, the SM captured all surcharge events correctly. NSE improved from 0.35 to 0.84 when subdividing the compartment into 17 subcompartments. Uncertainty of SM parameters was examined using the Generalized Likelihood Uncertainty Estimation (GLUE) methodology. Two different sampling methods were applied. Limits of acceptability for real-time control, warning and planning, resulted in many accepted models upstream and few to none in downstream backwater-prone areas. All applications showed SM uncertainty bands within expected uncertainty bands for DPM, supporting the use of a simpler conceptual model in fit-for-purpose modelling in urban water systems when computational demands of DPMs are prohibitive.

TI Examining the applicability of different sampling techniques in the

AB The applicability of the traditionally used overall decomposition-based (ODB) sampling technique in the development of forecasting models is controversial. This study first conducts a systematic investigation of the performance of models developed using the ODB sampling technique. A stepwise decomposition-based (SDB) sampling technique that is consistent with actual forecasting practice is then proposed. Moreover, a novel calibration algorithm that couples a two-stage calibration strategy with a shuffled complex evolutionary approach is formulated to help maintain the performance of models. The application of models produced using these different sampling techniques to four gauging stations in China and Canada indicates that (1) the ODB sampling technique that employ the discrete wavelet transform (DWT), empirical mode decomposition (EMD) and variational mode decomposition (VMD) as series decomposition techniques do not produce convincing forecasting models because additional information on the future streamflow that is to be predicted is introduced into the explanatory variables of the samples; (2) the SDB sampling technique strictly excludes information on future streamfiow from the explanatory variables and is thus as an appropriate alternative for developing forecasting models; (3) the DWT and VMD techniques benefit models by enhancing their performance; on the other hand, the EMD is unsuitable for use in forecasting, due to the variable number of subseries that result from the implementation of the stepwise decomposition strategy. Finally, methods that can be used to enhance the performance of decomposition-based models and the prediction accuracy of nonstationary streamflow are suggested.

AB Uncertainty in simulating hydrologic response to future climate is generally assumed to result from the combined uncertainties of the General Circulation Model (GCM), representative concentration pathway (RCP), downscaling method, and hydrologic model used. However, another source of uncertainty, the observed climate data source used to statistically downscale and bias-correct GCM projections, has largely been overlooked. This study assessed the shifts, variability, and uncertainty in streamflow simulation from three downscaling data sources (NCDC land-based weather stations, NEXRAD spatial grid, and PRISM spatial grid) relative to those introduced by six GCMs and three RCPs in west-central Kansas, U.S. Streamflow simulated by the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) hydrologic model was found to be more sensitive to future precipitation than to maximum and minimum temperatures. The greatest uncertainty in simulated streamflow was associated with selection of the GCM. Uncertainty in simulated streamflow associated with the observed bias-correction data source (NCDC, PRISM, NEXRAD) was greater than with RCPs and was primarily related to uncertainty in precipitation. This study highlighted the importance of recognizing uncertainty from bias-correction data sources in representing future climate scenarios in hydrologic simulations.

AB In mountainous catchments, soil erosion and sediment transport are highly variable throughout time and their quantification remains a major challenge for the scientific community. Understanding the temporal patterns and the main controls of sediment yields in these environments requires a long term monitoring of rainfall, runoff and sediment flux. This paper analyses this type of data collected during 7 years (2007-2014), at the outlet of the Galabre River, a 20 km(2) watershed, in south eastern France, representative of meso-scale Mediterranean mountainous catchments.
   This study is based on a hybrid approach using continuous turbidity records and automated total suspended solid sampling to quantify the instantaneous suspended sediment concentrations (SSC), sediment fluxes, event loads and yields. The total suspended sediment yield was 4661 Mg km(-2) and was observed during flood events. The two crucial periods for suspended sediment transport at the outlet were June and November/December (63% of the total). The analysis of suspended sediment transport dynamics observed during 236 flood events highlighted their intermittency and did not show any clear relationship between rainfall, discharge and SSC. The most efficient floods were characterised by counter-clockwise hysteresis relationships between SSC and discharges. The floods with complex hysteresis were the more productive in the long term, during this measuring period exceeding a decade. Nevertheless, the current research outlines the need to obtain medium-term (five years) continuous time series to assess the range of variations of suspended sediment fluxes and to outline clearly the seasonality of suspended sediment yields. Results suggest the occurrence of a temporal dis-connectivity in meso-scale catchments over short time-scales between the meteorological forcing and the sediment yields estimated at the outlet. These findings have important methodological impacts for modelling and operational implications for watershed management.

AB A storm, composed of two delayed cells, hit the Monte Antelao slopes (Dolomites, North Eastern Italy) in the early morning of July 18th, 2009. The resulting runoff triggered two consecutive debris flows along the Rovina di Cancia channel. The detailed topographic data collected before and just after this event allowed an accurate reconstruction of the morphological changes experienced by the channel bed. These data are here used as benchmark to test the ability of numerical models to reproduce the dynamics of a real event, taking into account the morphology changes of the channel bed. The aim is to provide an efficient model for engineering applications on large scales, such as those required by debris flow hazard assessment. A rainfall-runoff transformation is applied to reconstruct the solid-liquid hydrograph needed for computing the debris flow propagation. Two routing models are used: a GIS-based movable bed model, and a widely used fixed bed model (FLO-2D). Although similar results are obtained in terms of areas subjected to deposition, significant differences emerge in terms of mobilized volumes. Only the simulation of both the deposition and entrainment processes allows to reliably reproduce the sediment volumes estimated from the pre- and post-event topographic data. This information is fundamental in any hazard assessment because the volume of sediment mobilized by debris flow events exerts a fundamental control on the extension of areas subjected to inundation and on the thickness of sediment deposits. The capability to reproduce correctly the mobilized volumes also entails a more reliable simulation of the evolution of the peak and volume of the solid-liquid hydrograph as the debris flow propagates downstream, allowing the identification of the channel reach where banks could be overflowed. Conversely, adopting a fixed bed model leads mainly to an underestimation of the both the transported sediments volumes and the area subjected to deposition. As a consequence, the maximum debris flow depth in the portion of the channel subjected to erosion is underestimated and that in the portion of the channel subjected to deposition is overestimated. All these types of information are of great importance for an effective hazard assessment.

AB Hydrological drought is increasing under the impact of global change, which could have serious influences on the stability of ecological systems and water-dependent human activities in the affected regions. In this study, the total water storage (TWS) derived from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellites from 2003 to 2012 was downscaled to a finer resolution by incorporating the output from a land surface model. The downscaled data was used to identify hydrological drought for eight tributaries of the Yangtze River in China. The trend in the water storage deficit based on the downscaled GRACE data ranged from -0.86 to 0.29 mm month(-1) for the eight tributaries from 2003 to 2012, among which the absolute largest value occurred in the Poyang Lake Basin. The eight tributaries experienced between four and seven hydrological droughts during the study period, and droughts in 2003, 2006 and 2011 occurred in all of the tributaries. The drought recovery rate for the eight tributaries was between 4.5 and 7.2 mm month(-1), and the average drought recovery time was between 3.6 and 5.7 months. Tributaries with a high climate moisture index had low frequencies of drought occurrence but had long drought durations and large drought severities, resulting in long drought recovery times. Additionally, the impacts of human activity on hydrologic processes intensified significantly from 2003 to 2012, such as water storage in reservoirs and water consumption, leading to spatial differences in regional drought characterizations. The results are useful for the understanding of the mechanism of hydrological drought formation and the extension of GRACE applications in medium and small-scale catchments.

ID STABLE-ISOTOPES; RESERVOIRS; PRECIPITATION; GROUNDWATER; O-18
AB Cascade dams are known to influence the river water cycle, but their cumulative effects (CEs) are still not well understood. Water hydrogen (H) and oxygen (O) isotopes are hypothesized to be used to characterize the CEs. To test this hypothesis, we investigated water delta D, delta O-18, and related environmental factors in cascade reservoirs on the Wujiang River, Southwest China. The delta D and delta O-18 ranged from -64.2 parts per thousand to -45.4 parts per thousand and from -9.7 parts per thousand to -6.8 parts per thousand, respectively, and showed obvious temporal and spatial variations. Water temperature is an important factor influencing these variations. After damming, an increase of water retention time caused the enrichment of heavy H-O isotopes in reservoir surface water, and thermal stratification induced a decrease of delta D and delta O-18 with depth. Due to bottom discharge, released water showed more negative delta D and delta O-18 than reservoir surface water, and these delta D and delta O-18 differences were controlled by water retention time and mean water depth of the reservoir. Overall, the CEs of cascade dams caused delta D and delta O-18 to display a jagged increase from upstream to downstream in the impounded Wujiang River. Therefore H-O isotopes can be used to estimate the CEs of cascade dams. As cascade dams can modify H-O isotope signatures, caution should be exercised when using H and O isotopes to trace the source of the impounded river water.

AB We analyzed the relationships between meteorological drought and hydrological drought using very dense and diverse network of gauged natural drainage basins across the conterminous U.S. Specifically, this work utilized a dataset of 289 gauging stations, covering the period 1940-2013. Drainage basins were obtained for each gauging station using a digital terrain model. In addition to meteorological data (e.g., precipitation, air temperature and the atmospheric evaporative demand), we obtained a number of topographic, soil and remote sensing variables for each defined drainage basin. A hydrological drought index (the Standardized Streamflow Index; SSI) was computed for each basin and linked to the Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI), which was used as a metric of climatic drought severity. The relationships between different SPEI time-scales and their corresponding SSI were assessed by means of a Pearson correlation coefficient. Also, the general patterns of response of hydrological droughts to climatic droughts were identified using a principal component analysis. Overall, results demonstrate a positive response of SSI to SPEI at shorter time-scales, with strong seasonality and clear spatial differences. We also assessed the role of some climatic and environmental factors in explaining these different responses using a predictive discriminant analysis. Results indicate that elevation and vegetation coverage are the main drivers of the diverse response of SSI to SPEI time-scales. Similar analyses were made for three sub-periods (1940-1964, 1965-1989 and 1989-2013), whose results confirm considerable differences in the response of SSI to SPEI over the past eighty years.

AB Green Infrastructure (GI) is considered to be an innovative stormwater management approach that offers numerous other environmental benefits including reduction in air pollution and climate change mitigation compared with conventional gray infrastructures, and it has been gradually accepted and used worldwide. This review mainly focuses on the hydrological aspect of GI and provides a summary of the knowledge about GI as a stormwater management alternative. In this review, we discuss the operating mechanisms of a few widely-used GIs in the aspect of stormwater management. We critically examine policies for promoting GI implementation in some countries, including the sponge city in China and water sensitive urban design (WSUD) in Australia, and review the effectiveness of GI on treating stormwater quantity in real world applications. In addition, we also used Bibliometrics to analyze the GI research trends and found GI has been popular in an increasing number of countries and regions, which China has the greatest future growth potential in GIs research. Moreover, many barriers impeding the further development of GI and strategies to overcome these barriers are also summarized. This review gathers knowledge from many sources to provide an overview of GI to better understand its mechanisms and applications, and to highlight the areas that require future study.

AB The net amount of rainfall entering into the soil and its spatial distribution at the patch scale are key drivers of ecosystem processes in drylands. The spatial distribution of water is mainly controlled by vegetation canopy which determines the partitioning of rainfall into interception, throughfall and stemflow. In this paper, we synthesized and analyzed rainfall partitioning for 68 woody plant species in drylands (delimited by a rainfall-potential evapotranspiration ratio < 0.65; 46 papers). We explored the role of rainfall inputs and plant morphological attributes (life form, phenology, leaf type and bark type) by considering a rainfall gradient from 145 to 805 mm year(-1). On average, interception, throughfall and stemflow accounted for 24.0, 69.8 and 6.2% of total rainfall, respectively. Stemflow was the most variable flux (coefficient of variation = 107.8%), while interception and throughfall were less variable fluxes (coefficient of variation = 39.2 and 20.4%, respectively). Along the increasing rainfall gradient, interception showed a tendency to decrease from 27.1 to 18.9% (p = 0.12), throughfall increased from 61.4 to 81.2% (p < 0.01) and stemflow decreased from 10.0 to 1.6% (p < 0.0001). Shrubs presented higher stemflow than trees (9.4% vs. 3.5%, respectively; p < 0.0001), while trees presented higher throughfall than shrubs (72.3% vs. 63.0%, respectively; p < 0.05). Species with smooth barks presented higher stemflow than species with rough barks (8.3% vs. 4.2%, respectively; p < 0.0001). Both phenology and leaf type had no effect on interception, throughfall and stemflow (p > 0.05 for all cases). Shrubs were more abundant towards the dry edge of the rainfall gradient (145-500 mm year(-1)), while trees were more abundant towards the subhumid edge (500-805 mm year(-1)). These results suggested that higher stemflow found towards the dry edge of the rainfall gradient was caused by the higher abundance of shrubs, which generated more stemflow than trees. Our findings highlighted the ecohydrological key role of vegetation life form and rainfall inputs affecting the amount of water entering into the soil and its spatial distribution in drylands.

AB Streamflow is typically divided into two components for hydrograph separation, quickflow and baseflow. Baseflow is the portion of streamflow that contains groundwater flow and flow from other delayed sources and is of key importance for river basin ecology and water resources planning and management. The BaseFlow Index (BFI) is defined as the ratio of long-term mean baseflow to total streamflow. Knowledge of the BFI is not directly available for ungauged catchments and hence for most of the terrestrial land surface. In this study, the BFI was determined for all river reaches in New Zealand. First a recursive digital filtering technique was applied to separate baseflow from total streamflow for 482 gauged sites across New Zealand, whereby an individual filter parameter was determined for each catchment. Based on the baseflow and total streamflow data the long-term BFI for each gauged site was determined, as well as seasonal values of BFI. BFI varies between 0.20 and 0.96 with an average of 0.53, which indicates that 53% of long-term streamflow in New Zealand is likely to originate from groundwater discharge and other delayed sources. Long-term BFI values for all river reaches that comprise the New Zealand river network were predicted using the random forest technique. Furthermore, the winter to summer BFI for all river reaches in New Zealand were also determined. Distinct spatial patterns of the BFI were identified. While the spatial distribution and the magnitude of the BFI was determined by a combination of factors, certain patterns can be attributed to geological formations in New Zealand, namely the volcanic plateau region and the Southern Alps. While the dataset determined in this work can support work specifically pertaining to water resources planning and management in New Zealand, in particular water supply, stream ecology and pollution risk, the methodology devised to calculate the BFI for gauged sites and to predict the BFI for ungauged sites is applicable to any region around the world.

AB Typhoon Haiyan made landfall in the central Philippines on 8 November 2013 as one of the strongest tropical cyclones ever. It also affected a 23-year-old multi-species 'reforest' at Manobo near Tacloban City on Leyte Island. As part of a larger hydrological investigation of the impacts of reforestation on streamfiow response in the Tacloban area, gross rainfall (P), throughfall (TF; 24 roving collectors) and stemflow (SF; 12 trees) were monitored at Manobo between June 2013 and May 2014. Leaf Area Index (LAI) above each TF collector was measured regularly. Total rainfall interception losses (I) were determined using Gash's revised analytical model for three consecutive periods:(i) pre-Haiyan (baseline), (ii) post-Haiyan (damaged canopy), and (iii) after initial canopy recovery. Modeled I was 18% of P before disturbance, 12% for the period with the most extensive canopy damage, and 17.5% after initial canopy recovery. Stemflow was low, and weighted mean values accounted for 2.7%, 1.3% and 2.0% of P for the respective periods. Contrasts in period-average values of I reflected changes in LAI as well as wet-canopy evaporation rates. Storm-based TF fractions at the 5 m x 5 m sub-plot scale were inversely related to LAI, especially for small storms and low rainfall intensities. Inferred hourly rates of wet-canopy evaporation showed a strong positive relationship to hourly rainfall intensity during large storms. The revised analytical model was also run using pre-disturbance parameter values for the entire year to assess the overall effect of canopy damage on L. Estimated annual losses with and without canopy disturbance were 514 mm (15% of P) and 572 mm (17%), respectively. Thus, observed and inferred changes in rainfall partitioning after canopy disturbance and initial recovery were comparatively modest, likely because the measurement site was relatively sheltered from the winds during typhoon passage and re-foliation relatively rapid. However, given the predicted increase in occurrence of 'super-typhoons' due to continued global warming and oceanic freshening, the structure of forests in affected regions can be expected to be modified, with potential consequences for rainfall partitioning and hydrological response.

AB Understanding variations in soil moisture and soil water potential is important for describing hydrological processes at the hillslope scale. An intensive field campaign to measure soil moisture, soil water potential, and rainfall events was performed at many locations and depths to obtain seasonal and spatial distributions of hydrometric measurements along steep hillslopes. Soil moisture and soil water tension analysis showed seasonally distinctive features in statistics and probability distributions. The relationship between soil moisture and soil water tension was explored to characterize seasonal and spatial variations. The recession slopes of soil moisture at several given points of the relationship were also seasonally different. The Brooks and Corey model and the van Genuchten model were used to estimate parameters for the measured data to explain the spatial and seasonal variations. Soil water storage analysis not only indicated that lateral flow tends to be abundant at greater depths but also revealed a seasonal trend in development of subsurface flow in the downslope direction. The combined impact of topography and vegetation determined the seasonal differences in hydrometric responses along the hillslope locations.

AB To better understand the biogeochemical processes of iron, sulfur, and phosphorus and their coupled relationships, we used the in situ high-resolution diffusive gradients in thin films (DGT) technique to characterize labile Fe, S, and P in the sediment porewater of a mangrove coast in the Jiulong River Estuary, China. The distributions of DGT-labile Fe and S indicated that microbial sulfate reduction (MSR) and microbial iron reduction (MIR) exhibited an intense competitive relationship and temperature-dependent behavior. Thus, in addition to the expected MSR, MIR is an important or even predominant biogeochemical process for organic matter (OM) mineralization in this Fe-rich mangrove coast. Labile Fe, S, and P distributions and variations demonstrate that Fe redox cycling plays a crucial role in regulating P behavior and P cycling. An additional new finding is that the flux of labile S in the intertidal zone increases during flood tides and decreases during ebb tides, indicating that the formation and reoxidation of sulfide in surface layers are regulated by tide-induced redox changes. The net P flux associated with recirculated seawater was estimated to range from -0.306 +/- 0.001 to 0.343 +/- 0.013 mmol m(-2) d(-1) in the winter survey, suggesting that sediment porewater tends to be a P source in the subtidal zone and a P sink in the intertidal zone for the overlying seawater in winter. The continuous accumulation of labile P in surface sediment could be intensively released into the overlying seawater through prevailing MIR process in the subsequent riverine flood season, which may promote eutrophication of the adjacent Xiamen Bay.

AB Outcrop analogs for aquifers allow measurements of permeability with relatively high-resolution and mapping sedimentary unit types. The spatial bivariate structure of permeability is defined by aquifer architecture. The architecture is often organized into a hierarchy of unit types, and associated permeability modes, across different spatial scales. The composite covariance (or semivariogram) is a linear summation of the auto- and cross-covariances (or semivariograms) of unit types defined at smaller scales, weighted by the related proportions and transition probabilities. It is well-known that an appreciable fraction of the composite variance arises from differences in mean permeability across unit types defined at smaller scales. Previous work has shown that the transition probabilities usually define the spatial bivariate correlation structure. The composite spatial bivariate statistics for permeability (covariance or semivariogram) will not be representative unless data locations allow proper definition of the transition probabilities of the units. Quantification of the stratal architecture can be used to better interpret the transition probabilities and thereby improve a model for the sample covariance and semivariogram. In this paper, we use an inverse modeling algorithm to fit the components of the hierarchical model, written as nested functions, in developing a hierarchical spatial correlation models. Specifically, the least-squares criterion along with prior information and other weighted constraints are used as the objective function for the inverse problem, which is solved by the Gauss-Newton-Levenberg-Marquardt method. The estimated covariance and transition probability models provides accurate representation of the spatial correlation structure of permeability for field-measured data from in Espanola Basin, New Mexico.

AB Uncertainty is a defining characteristic of hydrologic investigations, with increasing recognition of parameter, structural, measurement, and prediction uncertainty. Here we suggest that an additional form of uncertainty-(geo)political uncertainty-is locally important, but commonly neglected. We define geopolitical uncertainty in hydrology as indefiniteness of water balance processes, the relative magnitude of hydrologic fluxes, or causality as a consequence of complex international relations amongst riparians of a transboundary basin forced by internal economic, political, and nationalistic drivers (as well as interactions amongst these drivers) under a regime of non-stationary climate. We suggest that such (geo)political uncertainty has developed in the Jordan River basin as a consequence of intentionally ambiguous language in the Israel Jordan Peace Treaty, outstanding discussions regarding water allocations to the Palestinian Authority, and lobbying by the powerful agricultural sector. In the presence of economic motives requiring consumption of water these drivers promote securitization manifested as secrecy regarding water management and consumption by the upstream riparian, which given non-stationary climate opens a void of (geo)political uncertainty in which the relative importance of climate variability and change becomes indeterminate relative to changing water consumption, thereby perhaps allowing the upstream riparian to increase water consumption. The consequence of this (geo) political uncertainty for hydrologic studies is large water balance uncertainty, inability to reproduce water consumption studies due to data secrecy, and disagreement regarding the relative importance of pertinent drivers (i.e., climate versus consumption). Greater acknowledgement and awareness of (geo)political uncertainty's impacts on hydrologic studies is needed, as are concerted efforts to reduce this uncertainty for the benefit of transparent water dialogue among riparians and knowledge-based management of common-pool resources.

AB The potential of aggregation-decomposition (AGDP) for flood control of mixed reservoir system remains unclear due to the flood variability and complex hydraulic connections. In this study, we develop flood classification-aggregation-decomposition (FAD) operating rules to adapt for flood variability and to account for the trade-offs between flood loss of the tributaries and that of the mainstream. Three steps are involved in the proposed FAD operating rules: (1) flood classification by projection pursuit (PP) coupled with genetic algorithm (GA); (2) definition of FAD operating rules using the AGDP model coupled with piecewise linear function based on flood classification; and (3) optimization of FAD operating rules by parameterization-simulation-optimization (PSO). A case study is performed with a large-scale mixed reservoir system in the Xijiang river basin (China) in three scenarios: conventional operation for the status quo year (CO-SQY), conventional operation for the perspective year 2030 (CO-2030) and FAD operation for the perspective year 2030 (FAD-2030). The results clearly show that flood classification enables reservoir operating rules to better adapt for flood variability, and the FAD operating rules in the scenario of FAD-2030 outperform the conventional operating rules in the scenarios of CO-SQY and CO-2030, as it considers flood variability and the trade-offs between flood loss of the tributaries and that of the mainstream.

AB This study examined the role of tree arrangement (random versus aligned) on the drag forces and velocity inside a 1/12th-scale model mangrove forest over a range of tree density (trees m(-2)). Each model tree included an aerial root system geometrically similar to Rhizophora, with maximum root height HRmax and water depth H > HRmax The non-dimensional root density was defined as a(r) HRmax with root zone frontal area per volume, a(r). For both random and aligned low-density forests, a(r) HRmax  < 0.1, the vertical profile of velocity followed a boundary layer shape. Within both random and aligned high-density forests, a(r) > 0.1, the velocity was diminished in the root zone (z < HRmax) and enhanced above the root zone, relative to the boundary layer profile. For all forest arrangements, the force on the roots dominated the force on the entire tree, even in cases with diminished velocity within the root zone. Compared with a tree at the leading edge, a tree inside a randomly distributed forest could experience either a greater or lesser force, and the variation in drag force increased with tree density. In contrast, for an aligned distribution of trees the force on an individual tree within the forest was always diminished relative to a tree at the leading edge. A drag coefficient was defined using a quadratic drag law. The forest-average drag coefficient, defined using the channel-average velocity, was up to 30 percent higher for random tree arrangements, compared to in-line tree arrangements.

AB The Pearl River Delta (PRD) is one of the most economically dynamic regions of China and has experienced rapid urbanization during the past decades. in this study, the effect of urbanization on summer rainfall events in the PRD region is investigated using the advanced Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model. Two comparative urban scenarios (2015 and 1991) were designed to test the sensitivity of summer rainfall to urbanization. The results indicate that the WRF model reasonably reproduces the general synoptic weather pattern, particularly for air temperature and relative humidity. Further comparative analysis reveals that extreme rainfall significantly increased in urban areas, while the total summer rainfall slight decreased. Urbanization causes changes in the surface energy balance, resulting in more sensible heat flux and less latent heat flux. The decreased latent heat flux dampens the moisture availability and results in the decline of the maximum convective available potential energy, which lead to the decrease of the total summer rainfall. In contrast, the increased sensible heat flux enhances the urban surface temperature and boundary layer circulations (e.g., elevated planetary boundary layer height and higher level of free convection and lifted condensation level) and carries more water mixing vapor into the atmosphere over urban areas, enhancing the frequency and intensity of extreme rainfall. The results suggest that urbanization plays an important role in the urban change of summer rainfall and causes more extreme rainfall events, thereby inducing flooding and property losses associated with large economic costs.

   STRATEGY
AB Hydrological model parameters are essential for model simulation, which may vary with time owing to climatic variations and human activities. As a result, the implementation of stationary parameters may lead to inaccurate streamflow simulation. Actual evapotranspiration (ET) is a crucial component of hydrological cycles with an important influence on regional climate characteristics. Our aim was to investigate an appropriate way to estimate time-varying parameters using streamflow and ET observations, and to explore the how the simulation efficiency would change when ET data were added into assimilation. Data assimilation techniques can automatically adjust hydrological model parameters according to changing conditions. The ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) technique was used to assimilate observations into a two-parameter monthly water balance model. Four data assimilation schemes were designed and applied in a synthetic experiment and 173 catchments in USA, including: (1) sole assimilation of streamflow to update both parameters, (2) joint assimilation of streamflow and ET to simultaneously update parameters, (3) sole assimilation of ET first to update parameter C (measuring evapotranspiration), and then subsequently joint assimilation of streamflow and ET to update parameter SC (measuring water storage capacity), and (4) sole assimilation of ET to update parameter C, and then sole assimilation of streamflow to update parameter SC. The four schemes were compared in terms of deterministic and probabilistic model performances, and model parameter correlations. The results indicated that: (1) the estimation of parameter C can be improved by assimilating ET observations into the model, and the time-varying model parameters obtained by adding ET data into assimilation led to a significant enhancement in deterministic streamflow and ET prediction, (2) among the three joint assimilation schemes, the deterministic model simulation performances were similar, while the ensemble predictions were more reliable in scheme 2. The joint assimilation of streamflow and ET to update both parameters in one step, i.e., scheme 2, outperformed the other two schemes in parameter SC estimation and model performance, (3) the ability to enhance simulation accuracy and to weaken correlations between parameters was more significant in humid catchments. The joint assimilation was helpful for the application of multiple sources of information into a hydrological simulation.

AB Flood risk management is gradually shifting from a risk-based approach to an integrated one that, among other elements, considers risk communication (RC) as a means of boosting resilience. Regardless of the above, few scientists have tackled up to now the integration of RC into flood risk management. In this connection, this particular study seeks to check out the potential of a risk dialogue approach (based on an ad hoc RC strategy) to change attitudes and behaviours in relation to flash flood risk. Via a pre-post survey design, we evaluated risk perception and awareness regarding a Civil Protection Plan (CPP) implemented locally (i.e., in the municipality of Navaluenga, central Spain). For this particular objective, a questionnaire survey was created, and 201 adults (representing more than 10% of the population census) were interviewed twice in a one-year period. Before the second survey, an RC strategy was created. The RC strategy comprised briefings, quiz answers, storytelling, a contest of videos and photographs about past floods, and an intergenerational workshop. A t-test for paired sample analyses and a general linear model (GLM) repeated measures ANOVA were applied to identify changes in risk perception and awareness. Our results indicate that the RC strategy did increase flood risk perception in Navaluenga in the long term (lifetime). Also, it increased the level of awareness of the various features that comprise the CPP, enabling people to be more competent in facing a flash flood. Some cognitive biases detected in the perceptual process of human beings may shed some light on the results obtained. The implementation of well-thought-out RC strategies can play a role in improving resilience, particularly in geographic areas such as the Iberian Peninsula, in which climate change scenarios indicate a likely increase in the severity and frequency of flooding.

TI Exploiting the spatial pattern of daily precipitation in the analog
   method for regional temporal disaggregation
SO JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY

   precipitation; Weather types; Spatial and temporal coherence; French

ID RAINFALL; TIME
AB The analog method relies on the subdaily distribution of analog days - also called fragments - to perform temporal disaggregation. The features that serve to define analog days are generally at the daily scale although they are assumed to convey information on the subdaily scale. In most cases, the only feature used is the daily total at the location of interest. Features pertaining to the synoptic circulation are also often used although with the purpose of increasing the spatial rather than the temporal resolution. Precipitation is conditioned not only on synoptic circulation but also on regional features such as orography. This combined effect is reflected on the spatial pattern of daily precipitation. We propose to rely on descriptions of the spatial pattern to select analog days in order to perform temporal disaggregation. Three analog method variants based on different sets of spatial pattern features, a variant that rely on synoptic circulation alone and a variant that combines synoptic circulation with spatial pattern features are evaluated and compared. All the features considered characterize a region therefore the same analog day is employed at all the locations within the region. Inter-site coherence is thus enforced. A leave-one-out procedure is carried out on hourly radar precipitation reanalyses covering a mountainous watershed in the French Mediterranean on a 1 km(2) grid over the period 1997-2006. Uncertainty is taken into account by generating five realizations of each variant. Performance is measured in terms of return levels (1-20 years) at various temporal scales (1 h to 12 h) and at two spatial scales - grid box and watershed. The proposed regional approach to temporal disaggregation globally preserves inter-site coherence. This can be seen from the relatively good reproduction of the regional pattern of return levels of the study area by all variants. Synoptic circulation conveys less information on the subdaily scale than spatial pattern features. The variant that depends on synoptic circulation alone largely overestimates return levels especially at lower temporal scales (1 h and 3 h). Combining synoptic circulation with spatial pattern features yielded no significant improvement.

AB Biocrust effects on soil water infiltration and hydropedological processes have attracted increasing attention in dryland ecosystems, but are nevertheless subjected to great controversy. According to some scholars, infiltration was assumed to decrease due to repellency and to increase with the organic matter content due to its role in increasing aggregate stability and porosity. These assumptions were checked in our study on the Loess Plateau of China. By using double-ring and disc infiltrometers, the infiltration curves of cyanobacteria and moss biocrusts as well as on bare soil were continuously measured, and the characteristics of water infiltration on biocrust-covered soil and its correlations with soil properties were analyzed. Our results showed that the cyanobacteria and moss biocrusts had significantly lower constant infiltration rates under ponding conditions (0.265 and 0.180 cm min(-1), respectively) as compared with the bare sand (0.372 cm min(-1)), and they took significantly more time (41% and 105%) and water (14% and 73%) to reach steady-state infiltration. Similarly, the saturated hydraulic conductivities of the cyanobacteria and moss biocrusts were 39% (0.514 cm min(-1)) and 65% (0.295 cm min(-1)) lower than that of the bare sand (0.839 cm min(-1)), respectively. More importantly, biocrust infiltrability was closely related with biocrust characteristics and soil properties, especially particle-size distribution and crust thickness. Contrary to some assumptions that attributed impeded infiltration to crust repellency, and increased infiltration to the role played by OM, both variables could not have explained the current results. Under tension and ponding conditions, cyanobacteria and moss biocrusts were found to greatly reduce surface soil infiltrability and impede soil water infiltration. These findings should be considered for future analyses of hydropedological processes in arid and semiarid regions.

AB Net primary production (NPP) is one of the most important components in the carbon cycle of terrestrial ecosystems. Climatic and hydrologic elements are among the primary factors controlling the dynamics of NPP at global and regional scales. Thus, understanding the interactions between them is of great importance for optimal ecosystem management. This study aimed to investigate the spatiotemporal change in NPP and its responses to both climatic and hydrologic factors in a semiarid watershed-the Upper reach of the Wei River Basin (UWRB)-on the Loess Plateau, China. To this end, an integrated hydro-biogeochemical model (SWAT-DayCent) was applied to examine NPP during the period 1987-2016. The results show that the SWAT-DayCent performed well in simulating both the hydrologic and the biogeochemical components in this typical loess watershed. Though the basin average NPP increased slightly during the recent 30 years (1987-2016), the spatial distribution varied significantly in the region, with a relatively higher level in the southeastern and western parts and a lower level in the northern part. The strongly positive responses of major vegetations to precipitation indicate that precipitation was the dominant factor driving the ecosystem production, whereas warming may exert negative effects, especially in the southeastern part of the UWRB. Further, the strongly positive relationships between NPP and soil water/ET also suggest that the ecosystem production relied heavily on the water availability, indicating a tightly-coupled water-carbon cycle in this region. Overall, our findings are of great importance for identifying the key driving forces of the ecosystem production and the interaction between water and carbon cycles. The study may also aid policymakers in seeking better eco-environmental management when facing the climate change on the Loess Plateau.

AB This paper demonstrated the benefits of statistical methods when investigating the climatic and non-climatic drivers responsible for variations in groundwater recharge with a series of up to 43 years of annual recharge for 426 bores in South-East South Australia. We identified the factors influencing groundwater recharge based on 71 climatic metrics and 17 non-climatic metrics (including groundwater abstraction). The results showed: (1) Rainfall during April to October was the most important variable influencing recharge temporal variation, with its decline identified as the most significant factor related to recharge reduction; (2) In contrast, a negative correlation between rainfall during December to February (DJF) and annual groundwater recharge was found. This suggests that a seasonal shift in rainfall (such as decreasing rainfall during April to October and an increase during DJF) can result in a decline in recharge even when the annual rainfall remains unchanged; (3) The length of wet spells (consecutive rain days) and increasing potential evapotranspiration (PET) were additional significant predictors for recharge temporal variation. It demonstrated that a simple empirical relationship (such as recharge as a fixed percentage of rainfall) is not a reliable estimation of renewable groundwater resources under changing climatic conditions; (4) There is a statistically significant correlation between mean groundwater depth and recharge, which implies that if groundwater level fall due to rainfall declines then a positive feedback loop can lead to further recharge declines; (5) Spatially the most statistically significant factors influencing groundwater recharge were soil types and land attributes. The findings of this study can identify which stressors should be included when investigating the impact of climate change on groundwater recharge.

AB For both physical and economic reasons, water scarcity has become a worldwide concern. To meet regional water demands and improve water resource optimization management, a multi-objective water resource allocation model was developed for a sustainable future, in which equity, efficiency, and sustainability were taken as the allocation principles to equitably maximize subarea economic and social welfare and coordinate social development and water management without compromising water ecosystem sustainability. To meet the water resource needs of both present and future generations, intra- and intergenerational equities were integrated using a Gini coefficient and a modified Bentham-Rawls criterion to allow for time and space social equity trade-offs for sustainable water allocation. To coordinate social development and water management for water sustainability, mean economic benefit efficiency was considered in the multi-objective water resource allocation model. By factoring in the competition between present and future generations, the ecological water requirements, and the fuzzy random water resource parameters, the optimal strategy better depicts a pattern of water inter-temporal configuration than current strategies. A case study from the upper reaches of the Minjiang River basin in China is given to demonstrate the practicality and rationality of the proposed model. Compared with previous models, the intergenerational allocation model was found to effectively consider sustainable water resource utilization, had a higher total social welfare value, and guaranteed equitable intra-generational water allocation.

AB To improve understanding of spatial, seasonal, and inter-annual variations in nitrate sources and in-stream processes in the Illinois River system, nitrate concentrations and isotopic compositions were measured in 445 water samples collected over a four-year period (2004-2008) from the Upper Illinois River Basin (UIRB). Samples included surface water in the river and major tributaries, effluent samples from Chicago's largest wastewater treatment plant (WTP), and representative groundwater from shallow wells in agricultural land. Two principal nitrate endmember sources within the UIRB had distinctive isotopic compositions: WTP effluent with delta N-15 = 8.6 +/- 1.7 parts per thousand and delta O-15 = 0.8 +/- 1.4 parts per thousand and agricultural groundwater with delta N-15-NO3 = 3.4 +/- 0.6 parts per thousand and delta O-18 = 3.7 +/- 0.5 parts per thousand (when minimally affected by nitrate reduction). Isotopic data indicated that the large pulse of nitrate exported from the river basin during the spring was mostly derived from agricultural land drainage, while nitrate from large WTP effluent point sources was predominant in the upper reaches of the river near Chicago. During low base-flow conditions in late-summer and fall, the agricultural nitrate source was greatly diminished and the headwater WTP source was predominant in the river basin export. Our results indicated biogeochemical nitrate reduction and isotopic fractionation occurred within the river network, affecting both agricultural and urban sources during surface-water transport. In addition, diminished agricultural nitrate export was attributable to preferential discharge of biogeochemically reduced groundwater during low base flow. Isotopic indicators of spatial and seasonal variations in the relative importance of different nitrate sources, and their relative susceptibility to natural attenuation, might be useful for guiding monitoring and management practices to reduce nitrate export from complex watersheds with mixed land uses.

TI Revisiting the modified Hvorslev formula to account for the dynamic

AB Estimating streambed hydraulic conductivity is particularly important in arid and semi-arid regions, where surface water infiltration from ephemeral dryland streams helps maintain riparian ecosystems. In situ permeameter tests are widely used to estimate the hydraulic conductivity of streambed sediments. Previous studies have demonstrated that one of the major factors controlling spatiotemporal variations in streambed hydraulic conductivity in such areas is streambed clogging by suspended sediments. Recently, a modified Hvorslev (1951) formula was theoretically proposed to account for the effect of streambed clogging on streambed hydraulic properties due to suspended particle sedimentation during falling-head tests. To validate the modified formula, fieldwork was conducted at five sites in the lower Heihe River, a typical intermittent river of north-western China, in September 2017. A simple PVC pipe with an inner diameter of 4 cm was used as a permeameter for the field tests. Both muddy river water and clean water were used to fill the permeameter to conduct comparative tests. To differentiate the interpretation of the field testing data obtained with clean water, the data obtained with muddy river water were analysed with an equation considering an iteratively increasing total hydraulic resistance of riverbed sediments due to the effects of riverbed clogging. The estimated vertical hydraulic conductivity for the top 0.3 m of riverbed sediments varied from 1 to 41 m/day. The proposed model was shown to accurately estimate the hydraulic conductivity of riverbed sediments using both clean and muddy water during slug tests.

AB Evapotranspiration was determined to be hydrological effect which induces suction. Evapotranspiration induced suction governs the slope stability, ground water recharge and runoff. This study focuses on suction induced in root zone of mix grass used in green infrastructure. Most of the previous studies focused on evapotranspiration induced suction less than 100 kPa measured using tensiometers. However, for investigating the drought condition, it is essential to obtain suction data greater than 100 kPa. It was noted that the response of plant parameters such as stomatal conductance and surface area were not considered holistically evapotranspiration induced suction. The main objective of this study is to investigate relationship among evapotranspiration induced suction, stomatal conductance and surface area for a mix grass species used in green infrastructure subjected to drought stress (corresponds to suction > 100 kPa). Stomatal conductance was observed to increase up to suction (6 +/- 1 kPa) corresponding to volumetric field capacity. Thereafter, large decrease (more than 90%) in stomatal conductance was found with an increase in suction. Stomatal conductance was found to be 0 at 2431 kPa (i.e., wilting point). Change in normalized surface areas of mix grass was found to be relatively low (within +/- 15%) with an increase in suction up to 138 kPa. However, beyond 138 kPa, it varied drastically (by 31-68%) with an increase in suction from 138 kPa to 3642 kPa. Two new relationships i.e., Stomatal conductance characteristic curve (SCCC) and surface area characteristic curve (SACC) were proposed. Therefore, the relationships developed in current study help to analyze the performance of green infrastructure accurately.

AB Periphyton is important to lake ecosystems, contributing to primary production, nutrient cycling, and benthic metabolism. Increases in periphyton growth in lakes can be indicative of changes in water quality, shifts in ecosystem structure, and increases in nutrient fluxes. In oligotrophic lakes, conservationists are interested in characterizing the influence of hydrological drivers on excessive periphyton growth along nearshore areas. We collected nutrient samples bi-weekly from groundwater and surface water during a 9-month monitoring period to evaluate the timing and availability of nutrients to eulittoral periphyton in Lake Tahoe. Groundwater discharge rates were measured synoptically using seepage meters and estimated indirectly using continuous head gradient measurements and aquifer properties estimated by slug tests. The discharge measurements made from the seepage meter measurements provide information about the spatial variability perpendicular from shore along and the change in groundwater discharge due to wave action. Algal biomass sampled from substrates and observed using underwater photographs were used to correlate seasonal growth and nutrient concentrations in groundwater and lake water. Results indicate that groundwater and nutrient discharge are temporally variable due to seasonal changes in recharge within the watershed, wave action, and lake stage. Groundwater discharge was enhanced by the seasonally-low lake stage and episodic recharge caused by precipitation falling as rain in the watershed. Increases in dissolved phosphorus and nitrate in the lake during winter are attributed to groundwater discharge and correlates to increases in algal biomass in the nearshore area. Results indicate that nutrient-rich groundwater discharge appears to stimulate seasonal periphyton blooms along the eulittoral zone of Lake Tahoe.

AB This article aims to provide an on the spot, handy field tool that can be used in estimating the Saturation Index with respect to calcite in karst aquifers in a limestone context. It relies on an abacus that gives the SIc by using measured pH and bicarbonate concentration as coordinates.
   The analytical expressions of the carbonate equilibrium equations are derived in order to calculate SIc from values that can be measured on field. Using these established relationships, we propose an Abacus built from the SIc = f(Pco(2)eq) reference frame, hence called SIc-Abacus.
   Accuracy of SIc calculation is also discussed. SIc is calculated with values measured considering uncertainty coming from pH ( +/- 0.05 pH units), temperature ( +/- 0.1 degrees C), bicarbonate and calcium concentrations ( +/- 2.5 mg/L and +/- 2 mg/L). This gives, for each sample, a range of possible SIc values of +/- 0.060 pH units (for a bicarbonate concentration close to 300 mg/L). The effect on SIc range of possible values given by bicarbonate and calcium uncertainties is about 10 times lower than the effect brought by pH uncertainty. Also, bicarbonate and calcium concentration can be estimated from electrical conductivity leading to a possible range of SIc value of +/- 0.087 pH units. In both cases, the range of possible values of SIc varies according to the bicarbonate concentration.
   Using Cussac and Lascaux sites, an evaluation was done. Results show the goodness of fit (R-2 = 0.96) between the calculated SIc from measured pH, bicarbonate and calcium concentration and the estimated SIc values generated from the SIc-Abacus. Apart from calculating SIc, another method which is an alternative use of the generated SIc equation focused on obtaining pH using parameters such as electrical conductivity and dissolved CO2 measurements is presented.
   The study shows that SIc-Abacus can be a new in-situ tool for karst aquifer surveys. It can facilitate in making a swift decision that tackles carbonate karst issues (e.g. when selecting sites or in deciding if extensive monitoring should be performed or not based from a specific objective).

AB Among the four types of drought, socioeconomic drought, which has a direct impact on human production and daily life, is the least understood. The current socioeconomic drought index proposed by Mehran et al. (2015) is the Multivariate Standardized Reliability and Resilience Index (MSRRI), which combines information on inflowdemand reliability and water storage resilience. The MSRRI resolves the problem of difficult quantification of socioeconomic drought. However, the MSRRI also has some flaws such as ignoring reservoir dispatching regulations and the relationship between water supply and water demand. Therefore, this study aims to improve the MSRRI through combining reservoir operation processes and actual water supply and demand and proposing an improved MSRRI (IMSRRI). The upper Yellow River Basin (UYRB) was selected as a case study, and comparison between the MSRRI and IMSRRI was conducted. The evolution characteristics of the IMSRRI series in the UYRB were examined. Additionally, cross-wavelet analysis was utilized to reveal the associations between the IMSRRI series and climate factors. Results indicated that: (1) compared with the MSRRI, the IMSRRI could capture the onset and termination of socioeconomic drought more accurately and reasonably due to the fusion of reservoir scheduling characteristics at a smaller timescale; (2) the socioeconomic drought in the UYRB had dramatically changed during the past few decades (the IMSRRI series showed a significantly decreasing trend and two change points (1995 and 1975) were captured); and (3) the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and the Atlantic Oscillation (AO) showed significant influences on the short period (the influences of ENSO were stronger than AO), while sunspots had the strongest impacts on the long period.

AB The hydrology and stormwater management benefits of green roofs (GRs) when integrated with photovoltaic (PV) arrays are currently not well understood. This study is the first quantitative study of an integrated full-scale GR-PV system in Canada. In this project, two GR-PV systems, with low (0.6 m) and high (1.2m) differential height (LDH and HDH) between the GR surface and PV panels have been compared with a GR test module for storm water retention and biomass. Over 51 rainfall events in summer and fall 2016 and spring 2017, rainwater retention, peak flow reduction, NRCS curve number, and biomass of GR-PV and GR systems were examined. Rainwater retention and peak flow reduction were not significantly different between the LDH and HDH systems. Vegetation growth was 47% greater in the HDH system compared to the LDH system. This was attributed to greater solar radiation and rain exposure of vegetation in the HDH system due to the greater vertical distance between the PV panels and the GR modules.

AB Overland routing processes are critical for understanding the water environment impact of the urbanization-induced land-cover change and guiding the optimized landscape planning. However, current models generally tend to simplify the overland flow process by a semi-distributed routing approach. In this study, the cellular automata-based hydrology and NPS pollution model (CA-HNPSM) is established by integrating the CA-based overland runoff routing algorithm and the NPS pollution module. Three-layer spaces were also constructed by considering the hydrological connection among urban roofs, land surfaces and artificial drainage networks. Simplified sewer routing modules were introduced to improve the applicability of the CA algorithm in urban NPS pollution studies with insufficient drainage data. Then, the CA-HNPSM is tested in a real case study on an urban catchment in Beijing, China. Based on the results, the CA-HNPSM shows good performance in both the hydrological and NPS simulations in terms of the Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient and coefficient of determination. Detailed overland routing processes and hydrological and pollution results are provided. In addition, landscape configurations along the overland flow routs could also be identified. These overland results can be used as powerful reference for optimized landscape planning and the allocation of management measures.

AB Nutrient enrichment from natural and anthropogenic activities is one of the major environmental pollution stressors. This study presents an integrated framework that couples a mesoscale atmospheric analysis system (SAFRAN), an agronomic model (STICS) and a distributed hydro(geo)logic model (EauDyssee) to estimate nitrogen flux at the regional scale. The EauDyssee modeling framework was developed to include nitrate transport from soils to rivers via surface runoff and stream-aquifer interactions. Further, an in-stream nitrate model was developed based on the large-scale river routing of the framework. The utility of the integrated framework was demonstrated on the Seine River Basin (SRB), which has an area of 88,000 square kilometers. The SRB is one of the most productive agricultural areas in France and encompasses the megalopolis of Paris. This basin is a complex hydrosystem with multiple aquifers. The STICS-EauDyssee integrated framework was implemented for a long-term simulation covering 39 years (1971-2010) at a daily time step. Comparison of groundwater nitrate concentrations with observations showed an overall absolute bias of less than 10 mg/L. Model results showed that simulated nitrate flux to rivers highly depend on the inflow produced by surface and subsurface waters. Results also demonstrated that approximately 10% of leaching nitrate flux is delivered to the river network from stream-aquifer interactions. The statistical analysis indicates the modeling system performs better in the eastern region of the SRB in comparison to the western part of the basin, due to the hydrological complexity of the western part of the basin. Comparison of maximum nitrate concentration between dry and wet years (1990 and 2001) showed an increase of 60%, largely driven by more annual water yield in the wet year compared to the dry year.

AB The paper presents various aspects of monitoring streamflows with stage-discharge (HQRC) and index-velocity (IVRC) based ratings at a non-ideal gaging station with emphasis on their reliance during fast-varying unsteady flows. For this purpose, the paper analyzes data obtained from customized experiments whereby the flow phases are tracked as they develop during flow transitions. The analysis compares discharges obtained from HQRC and IVRC ratings with those directly measured with Acoustic Doppler Current Profilers (ADCP) and a flowmeter set in the housing of the turbines that release the flow in the downstream channel. It is found that during steady flows, both HQRC and IVRC methods perform within the widely accepted +/- 5% thresholds recommended for streamflow gaging despite that the site considerably deviates from the guidelines for gaging site selection. For unsteady flows, the performance of the IVRC is considerably better than HQRC. Attempts are made to complement the typical statistical analysis used for assessing the quality of discharge estimates provided by the ratings with insights into flow characteristics that deteriorate the quality of the flow estimates passing through the stations.

AB The lower reaches of the Yellow River (Huanghe), a typical "raised bed river," have experienced many huge flood events in Chinese history. As the main factor controlling the topographic evolution of the channel, the water and sediment-supply conditions of the Yellow River have undergone significant changes since the implementation of the water and sediment regulation scheme (WSRS) in 2002 by the joint operation of large reservoirs. Hence, it is necessary to conduct systematic research and evaluation on how the regulation scheme influences the scouring and deposition of the downstream channel. This study used the elevation data of 79 fixed profiles collected between 1992 and 2012 from the channel downstream from Gaocun in the Yellow River to establish a digital elevation model. The elevation model was used to investigate the spatio-temporal characteristics of channel scouring and deposition in the study area and to determine the main controlling factors. The results show that on an inter-annual scale, the channel scouring and deposition pattern began to change from substantial deposition to rapid erosion after 2002. On a seasonal scale, the overall characteristic was erosion in the flood season and deposition in the dry season; however, the erosion rate in the flood season increased and the deposition rate in the dry season decreased after 2002. From the spatial perspective, the downstream riverbed experienced net deposition before 2002 and net scouring after 2002. The WSRS altered the regimes of water and sediment of the river and therefore dominated scouring and deposition in the downstream channel. Since the implementation of the WSRS, continuous channel scouring in the study area provided about 41% of coarse-grained sediments for the Yellow River, and formed an important source of sediments entering the sea. However, because of the formation of an armor layer of coarse-grained sediments on the downstream riverbed surface due to continuous scouring after the implementation of the WSRS, the erosion flux of the river channel in the lower reaches of the Yellow River has shown a significant decrease since 2005. This study provides a typical case study for the response of the topographic evolution of rivers to water and sediment changes under the influence of intense human activities.

AB Successful data assimilation depends on the accurate estimation of forcing data uncertainty. Forcing data uncertainty is typically estimated based on statistical error models. In practice, the hyper-parameters of statistical error models are often estimated by a trial-and-error tuning process, requiring significant analyst and computational time. To improve the efficiency of forcing data uncertainty estimation, this study proposes the direct use of existing ensemble climate products to represent climate data uncertainty in the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) of flow forecasting. Specifically, the Newman et al. (2015) dataset (N15 for short), covering the contiguous United States, northern Mexico, and southern Canada, is used here to generate the precipitation and temperature ensemble in the EnKF application. This study for the first time compares the N15 generated climate ensemble with the carefully tuned hyper-parameters generated climate ensemble in a real flow forecasting framework. The forecast performance comparison of 20 Quebec catchments shows that the N15 generated climate ensemble yields improved or similar deterministic and probabilistic flow forecasts relative to the carefully tuned hyper-parameters generated climate ensemble. Improvements are most evident for short lead times (i.e., 1-3 days) when the influence of data assimilation dominates. However, the analysis and computational time required to use N15 is much less compared to the typical trial-and-error hyper-parameter tuning process.

AB The study explores the shifts in water management paradigms in the Caspian Sea basin over the last three centuries with an emphasis on the period after 1990. The investigation is based on the chronological analysis of developments in the water sector, treaties and agreements between the littoral states, important technical inventions, and changes in political regimes. The methodology used in the paper captures two concepts. The concept of water management paradigms helps to comprehend developmental stages of water management of the Caspian Sea. The concept of hydrosocial cycle was applied as an analytical lens for studying each paradigm. We examine different understandings of water in the following five stages: i) pre-industrial era (before 1846); ii) industrialization era (1846-1917); iii) Soviet collectivization era (1917-1940); iv) hydraulic mission (1940-1990); v) independent littoral states (1990-present). Before the Industrial Revolution, the Caspian Sea was managed by the Russian Empire and Persia for navigation and fishing only. The ensuing technical progress gave an impulse to regional sectoral activities, pushing forward the hydraulic mission that caused a considerable degradation of the sea's ecosystems. The adoption of the Tehran Convention in 2003 became a first step towards the Integrated Water Resources Management (IWRM) paradigm for the Caspian. However, the water governance of the Caspian states does not adhere to the principles of IWRM and, consequently, environment continues to deteriorate. The study provides new directions and approaches for reviewing the role of society in the governance of the Caspian Sea and its resources.

AB Check dams are very important structures for torrent control areas throughout the world. Measuring the sediment deposition behind check dams is thought to be an effective method of estimating the sediment yield of small catchments. In this study, we employed a high-density electrical resistivity system to detect sediment at six check dams distributed in the hilly and gully area of the Loess Plateau. A total of 11 lines were arranged, with 60 electrodes along each line. The resultant resistivity data were inverted into subsurface structures using least-squares inversion techniques. The results indicate that the sediment bottom can been identified using an electrical resistivity contour method. Using trenches, boreholes and drillings to calibrate the calculated values, the accuracy of the high-density electrical resistivity tomography method was found to be quite high (95.7%). The bulk density increases with the sediment deposit depth and can reach a maximum of 1.6 g cm(-3). Geometric methods considering three shapes (V-shaped, U-shaped and trapezoidal) were used to estimate the profile area of the check dams; the V-shaped geometric method showed high accuracy. This study provides a four-step approach based on high-density electrical resistivity tomography and a geometric method to estimate sediment yield for check dam-controlled catchments. This methodology enables the measurement of the total sediment yield, including both the suspended and bedload sediment transport, from an ungauged catchment.

AB This paper presents a model of flow and solute transport of intermittent catchments in arid and semi-arid regions, highlighting challenges caused by the complex interactions between subsurface and surface flows. A case study is used for the application of the integrated MIKE SHE model to investigate temporal and spatial dynamics of water and salinity in a small ephemeral catchment in southwestern Victoria, Australia. MIKE SHE was successfully calibrated and validated against experimental data of streamflow, groundwater levels, and salt discharged from the catchment. Projections of climatic conditions, adopting Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) 4.5, 6.0, and 8.5, were used to infer how salinity discharge and concentrations might be affected across a range of greenhouse gas emission scenarios with different severity. The calibration of the water fluxes was solely based on parameters associated with the model of evapotranspiration, with other parameters selected from field observations and literature. The calibrated parameters for the salt transport were the longitudinal and lateral dispersivities. The calibration and validation of streamflow series led to Index of Agreement (IoA) of 0.92 and 0.8 respectively, while the simulation of groundwater levels was more challenging (IoA ranging from 0.22 to 0.89). Parameter equifinality was observed, with different parameter sets achieving a good fit of streamflow and groundwater levels, although leading to differing spatial patterns of evapotranspiration rates. Calibration and validation of the discharge concentrations appeared more difficult (IoA of 0.35 for calibration and 0.44 for validation) as they are affected by errors in the simulated flow. Climate projections RCP 8.5 suggested a reduction of salt discharge with consequent increased concentrations within the catchment. The study showed the ability of MIKE SHE to be successfully applied to intermittent dry catchments to possibly support water and land management.

AB According to the hydrological characteristics of a multi-source irrigation system with paddy rice, the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) is improved to develop a distributed hydro-agronomic model. A technique with three critical depths is incorporated to control the irrigation and drainage of paddy fields. In addition, the evapotranspiration (ET) of a paddy field is estimated based on two types of water storage conditions within SWAT. Specifically, we propose a multi-source auto-irrigation framework for SWAT to estimate agricultural irrigation water consumptions (AIWCs) from different water sources. Furthermore, we apply the improved SWAT to the Yangshudang (YSD) basin, located in the Zhanghe Irrigation System (ZIS) of southern China, and the simulation results are compared with the observed data as well as with those of the original SWAT. The results indicate that compared with the original SWAT, the Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) of daily discharge increases from 0.48 to 0.80 in the calibration period and from 0.68 to 0.84 in the validation period; in addition, the NSE of the daily ET increases from -0.09 to 0.90, and other evaluation metrics also increase. Moreover, the percent bias (PBIAS) between the total Arwc simulated by the improved SWAT and the observed value is 2.75%, and that is -48.59% for the original SWAT. In particular, the improved SWAT estimates AIWCs from local water sources (ponds and rivers) and the main Zhanghe Reservoir, and the simulated AIWCs approximate the observed values. Therefore, the improved SWAT is more effective and suitable for the simulation of hydrological processes than the original SWAT in the multi-source irrigation systems with paddy rice, and it can estimate the AIWCs from different water sources, which can provide irrigation management decision support for irrigation managers.

AB The purpose of an early warning system (EWS) is to issue warning signals prior to extreme events. Extreme weather events, however, are hard to predict due to their chaotic behavior. This paper suggests a method for an effective EWS for very short-term heavy rainfall with machine learning techniques. The EWS produces a warning signal when it is expected to reach the criterion for a heavy rain advisory within the next 3 h. We devised a selective discretization method that converts a subset of continuous input variables to nominal ones. Meteorological data obtained from automatic weather stations are preprocessed by the selective discretization and principal component analysis. As a classifier, logistic regression is used to predict whether or not a warning is required. A comparative evaluation was performed on the EWS models generated by various classifiers. The tests were run for 652 locations in South Korea from 2007 to 2012. The empirical results showed that the preprocessing methods improved the prediction quality and logistic regression works well on heavy rainfall nowcasting in terms of F-measure and equitable threat score.

AB A proposal to increase wastewater infiltration at the Kwinana Wastewater Treatment Plant (KWTP) to an unconfined aquifer near a groundwater flow-through wetland (The Spectacles) in Western Australia, prompted a study of the groundwater geochemistry and water levels to identify the water types and to develop a conceptual model for groundwater flow and geochemical evolution. Within the catchment, the water table has dramatically declined (e.g up to -70 to - 90 mm/yr over three decades) due to the drying climate and increasing demand for groundwater. Annual rainfall has declined by 9 mm/decade on average or about 1.4% of the annual mean over the last three decades Wastewater infiltration began in 1975 and has increased to the current rate of 4.7 thousand cubic meters per day. Groundwater-surface water interactions were interpreted using multivariate statistical analysis of major ion and stable isotope (delta O-18, delta D) data. Rainwater infiltrating through the aquifer interacts with carbonate minerals while flowing westward to produce a Ca-HCO3 type of water (Group 1). Below the wetland, groundwater has an evaporative signature (Group 2) that has higher concentrations of TDS (> 1 g/L) and distinctively higher delta O-18 (> 2.5 per mil) than groundwater derived from wastewater infiltration (Group 3). The ratio of ions (K:Cl) was used to understand the mixing of water types and to quantify the proportions of wastewater at the site. Water samples collected in 2014 reveal a high proportion ( > 34%) of wastewater within the uppermost 30 m of aquifer and generally decreasing proportions with distance away from the source. Further investigation of The Spectacles water balance and hydrochemistry is needed to optimally manage and prevent degradation of the water quality. Proposed increases in wastewater recharge may continue to help offset the impact of the drying climate on lake levels.

AB Lake Chad is an endorheic lake in the Sahel region of Africa at the southern edge of the Sahara Desert. The lake, which is well known for its dramatic decrease in surface area during the 1970s and 1980s, experiences an annual flood resulting in a maximum total surface water area generally during February or March, though sometimes earlier or later. People along the shores of Lake Chad make their living fishing, farming, and raising livestock and have a vested interest in knowing when and how extensive the annual flooding will be, particularly those practicing recession farming in which the fertile ground of previously flooded area is used for planting crops. In this study, the authors investigate the relationship between lake and basin parameters, including rainfall, basin evapotranspiration, lake evapotranspiration, lake elevation, total surface water area, and the previous year's total surface water area, and develop equations for each dry season month (except November) linking total surface water area to the other parameters. The resulting equations allow the user to estimate the December average monthly total surface water area of the lake in late November, and to make the estimates for January to May in early December. Based on the results of a Leave One Out Cross Validation analysis, the equations for lake area are estimated to have an average absolute error ranging from 5.3 percent (for February estimates) to 7.6 percent (for May estimates).

AB The stable isotopic composition of water (delta O-18, delta H-2) is used to trace different components of the hydrological cycle, particularly interactions between precipitation, surface, and ground water. In Greece, insufficient spatial coverage for isotopes in precipitation hinders investigations of relationship between ground water and precipitation, information that is required to help quantify aquifer replenishment rates. We used precipitation, geospatial, ground water isotope data and General Linear Models (GLM) to predict the spatial distribution of isotopes in phreatic ground water in Greece. Prediction covariates of elevation, latitude, distance to nearest coastline, drainage basin (western vs. eastern Greece), and amount of precipitation predicted 62% of the isotopic variance in ground water. The GLM model yielded predictions of the isotopic composition of shallow aquifers, which allowed us to construct maps for use in hydrological and other forensic applications in Greece. A comparison of the stable isotope values predicted by our GLM to those of existing precipitation models revealed that phreatic aquifers in Greece are mainly recharged during the annual wet period, between November and March, as documented by the high overlap coefficients of 0.77 and 0.82, respectively. Rainy-period-biased aquifer recharge has implications for water quality and management issues, for example, nitrate pollution may be enhanced in the non-growing rainy period when crop uptake is the lowest, or for water resource management if climatic changes alter these temporal rainfall patterns.

AB It is generally acknowledged in the environmental sciences that the choice of a computational model impacts the research results. In this study of a flood and drought event in the Swiss Thur basin, we show that modeling decisions during the model configuration, beyond the model choice, also impact the model results. In our carefully designed experiment we investigated four modeling decisions in ten nested basins: the spatial resolution of the model, the spatial representation of the forcing data, the calibration period, and the performance metric. The flood characteristics were mainly affected by the performance metric, whereas the drought characteristics were mainly affected by the calibration period. The results could be related to the processes that triggered the particular events studied. The impact of the modeling decisions on the simulations did, however, vary among the investigated sub-basins. In spite of the limitations of this study, our findings have important implications for the understanding and quantification of uncertainty in any hydrological or even environmental model. Modeling decisions during model configuration introduce subjectivity from the modeler. Multiple working hypotheses during model configuration can provide insights on the impact of such subjective modeling decisions.

AB Under the increasing risk of water scarcity, aquifer management strategies can take advantage of a deeper knowledge about the natural long-term fluctuations driven by climate patterns. This study examines the links between major large-scale atmospheric circulation modes and inter-annual to decadal oscillations in groundwater levels in Portugal. Precipitation and piezometric records (1987-2016) from two aquifer systems, Leirosa-Monte Real in the north and Querenca-Silves in the south, are analyzed using wavelet transform methods and singular spectral analysis. Wavelet coherences computed between hydrologic time series and the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), East Atlantic (EA) and Scandinavia (SCAND) climate patterns show non-stationary relationships that are nonetheless consistent in distinct period bands. The strongest covariability occurs in the 6-10 years band for NAO, in the 2-4 years band for EA (especially after 1999) and in the 4-6 years band for SCAND (mainly after 2005). NAO is the mode playing the most relevant role with a stronger influence in the south (60% on average) than in the north (40% on average). The relatively higher frequency ( < 5 year period) contributions of EA and SCAND are difficult to set apart but their joint impact accounts for approximately 20% and 40% of the total variance of groundwater levels in the south and north of the country, respectively. Wavelet coherence patterns also expose transitive couplings between NAO, EA and SCAND. Often, coupled phases between climate modes mark abrupt transitions in synchronization patterns and shifts in the time-frequency domain. Extremes in groundwater storage coincide with anti-phase NAO and EA combinations: maximum piezometric levels occur during NAO-EA + (coincidentally also SCAND + ) phases while minimum levels occur during NAO + EA - phases.

AB Coastal flooding due to storm surge and sea-level rise (SLR) affects seawater intrusion (SWI) in aquifers. Under coastal flooding events, SWI from both sea boundary and land-surface is expected to increase. SWI in coastal aquifers is also strongly influenced by geological heterogeneity characteristics. In this study, the combined impacts of fully geological heterogeneity and coastal flooding on SWI is quantified in a two-dimensional unconfined coastal aquifer. Three indices including the seawater toe location (x(toe)), the mixing volume (v(mv)) and the SWI volume (v(swiv)) are used to assess the vulnerability to the intrusion of the seawater. A series of 50 log-normally distributed random hydraulic conductivity with a spherical correlation function is generated using the GCOSIM3D code. Then, numerical simulations of transient, saturated-unsaturated variable-density flow and solute transport, SUTRA, are performed in a stochastic Monte Carlo framework to understand how coastal flooding and geological heterogeneity effects can change the groundwater salinity.
   During storm surge events, seawater penetrates into the aquifer and leads to reduce temporary of the freshwater quality. The results indicate that the storm surge has a short-term impact on fresh groundwater. The aquifer is significantly influenced by SLR as a long-term effect while it causes a larger x(toe) in comparison with pre-flooding events' conditions. Also, the results obtained under gradual and instantaneous assumption of SLR show that the gradual assumption leads to a smaller x(toe) which is more realistic. Comparison of the homogeneous and heterogeneous scenarios indicates the heterogeneity affects SWI status both in the presence and the absence of coastal flooding events. It causes reduction in x(toe) and v(swtv) as well as increase in v(mv). This study shows the significant value of considering a wide range of variations due to heterogeneity, in order to better manage the coastal fresh groundwater aquifers.

AB Over a five year period, the Longmen Shan thrust belt was the source of the 2008 Ms 8.0 Wenchuan earthquake and the 2013 Ms 7.0 Lushan earthquake, leaving a seismic gap between the seismogenic structures of these two earthquakes. In this study, we report on a trenching and dating program to assess the rupture behavior of the Shuangshi-Dachuan fault, as well as analyzing its geological significance, and discussing the seismic potential of the seismic gap. One paleoseismic event (5382-385 yr B.C.) and another possible event (1013-1560 yr A.D.) were identified in our study. Based on geological physiognomy (fault geometry and paleoseismic events, etc.) and geophysical marks etc, the Shuangshi-Dachuan fault in the seismic gap can be divided into two segments (a southern segment 1 and a northern segment 2). Based on six trenches across the Shuangshi-Dachuan fault in the seismic gap, using the event window method, at least four paleoseismic events are identified (120-435 yr B.P., 720-905 yr B.P., 2475-2717 yr B.P., 2335-3830 yr B.P. (closest to 3830 yr B.P.)). The change in characteristics such as strike, main stress, maximum dislocation of single paleoseismic events, and strike fault activity trace, from segment 1 to segment 2, reflect the character of the Longmen Shan thrust belt transition zone. Vertical displacements of single earthquakes from the six trenches in the seismic gap are similar and small (0.2-0.4 m), the reason for which may be that the seismic gap is a weak part in the upper crust of ductile rocks with low stress. The seismic capacity of the seismic gap is likely Ms < 7.0 and the probability that large earthquakes will occur in the near future is low.

AB The Chinese Continental Scientific Drilling (CCSD) project has drilled a 5100 m deep research borehole in the Sulu ultra-high pressure (UHP) metamorphic belt, eastern China. The UHP metamorphic belt is thought to be a product of continent-continent collision and has consequently experienced very intensive structural deformation. Based on a more complete well log data set of CCSD borehole, we can have a more detailed and reliable study on the structure features of borehole wall and other rock physical properties than a previous study published in 2009. Abundant data related to borehole breakouts (BOs), drilling induced tensile fractures (DITFs) and natural fractures were collected from the image logs. The BO and DITF data indicate that the average direction of the maximum horizontal principal stress (S-H) of the CCSD borehole site is about 79.2 degrees which is consistent with the convergent direction (E-W) of the Pacific Sea Plate with respect to the Eurasian Plate. Analysis of DITFs indicated that in the case of the CCSD borehole, axial drilling induced tensile fractures (ADITFs) occur occasionally in the upper section (0-2300 m) of the borehole with low dipping angle (0-10 degrees), while transverse drilling induced tensile fractures (TDITTs) occur significantly in the lower section (3800-5000 m) with high dipping angle (10-30'). The natural fracture distribution at depth in the metamorphic rocks of the CCSD borehole indicates that (1) the failure strength of rocks and borehole depth are two factors that affects natural fracture frequency, (2) most of the dip azimuth of natural fractures is consistent with the dip azimuth of foliations observed in the core, (3) the development of most of the natural fractures probably was dominated by the development of foliations, and both the natural fractures and foliations developed in response to the subduction and exhumation of the Sulu terrene.

AB The Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM) is one of the most pronounced and widely documented global warming events in the geological history that occurred at the beginning of the Eocene (similar to 56 Ma) causing substantial changes in biota and geochemistry. It is marked worldwide by a negative isotopic excursion of delta C-13. The biotic changes associated with the PETM in marine realm include bloom of the dinoflagellate Apectodinium, turnover of larger foraminiferids, diversification of planktic foraminiferids, and carbonate dissolution of calcareous test shells, etc. while the geochemical changes include decrease in carbonates and increase in abundance of silicates and phyllosilicates, etc.
   Conspicuously, there has been no attempt to identify the PETM in the Himalaya even though some Himalayan sections are known to have Paleocene-Eocene transition beds. To fill this lacuna, we investigated the basal part of the late Paleocene-middle Eocene Subathu Group exposed at the village Kurla near Subathu in Himachal Pradesh (NW sub-Himalaya) for biotic, mineralogical, and geochemical signatures of this abrupt warming event. The significant results of this study include carbon isotope excursion (CIE) of 3.4 parts per thousand, occurrence of index di-noflagellate genus Apectodinium, and carbonate dissolution of the larger benthic foraminiferids. The mineralogical changes noted across the Paleocene - Eocene transition include increase in quartz and phyllosilicates and decrease in carbonates. The geochemical changes include (i) increase in SiO2, Al2O3, K2O, and Fe2O3, (ii) decrease in CaCO3, (iii) decreasing trend of Si/Al, Fe/Al, and Mg/Al ratios, (iv) increasing trend of K/Al, Ti/Al, and Zr/Al ratios, (v) changes in trace element abundance, (vi) maximum chemical index of alteration (CIA) of 85-89%, and (vii) increase in abundance of rare earth elements. The aforementioned dataset is clearly very close to the PETM and even reflects its probable onset and peak phases, however, it is insufficient to definitively identify the PETM in the studied section. Nevertheless, since this study is the first from a Himalayan section and brings out considerable new information, all results and interpretations are presented and discussed here.

AB Understanding the locational differences of time-temperature (t-T) paths within the granite contributes to clarifying the detailed formation history, especially the thermal evolution, of the entire pluton after the incipient intrusion of the granitic magma into the shallow crust. The position-by-position t-T paths of fifteen samples of the Toki granitic pluton, central Japan, are reconstructed from thermochronological data, including zircon U-Pb, biotite K-Ar, zircon fission-track (ZFT), and apatite fission-track (AFT) ages, FT length characterization, and FT inverse calculation. In case of sample No. 1, the t-T path consists of zircon U-Pb ages (74.0 +/- 1.1 Ma and 72.6 +/- 1.7 Ma), a biotite K-Ar age (73.0 +/- 1.8 Ma), a ZFT age (57.2 +/- 2.3 Ma), an AFT age (41.5 +/- 2.7 Ma), and the FT inverse calculation. The t-T paths show position-specific characteristics that reflect the history of the pluton after the incipient intrusion of the granitic magma into the shallow crust. Shallow parts of the western and northeastern margins of the pluton show rapid cooling from the intrusion stage to the ZFT partial annealing zone (PAZ), and thus represent position-specific characteristics in relation to crustal assimilation in the intrusion/emplacement processes. The cooling behavior around the condition of AFT PAZ was interpreted as a reflection of regional tectonic exhumation of the pluton. This study also presents useful knowledge to evaluate fracture populations in a granitic pluton. The relationship between the position-specific t-T path and fracture frequency (fracture number per unit interval) provides a criterion for evaluating the fracture population of the granitic pluton, called 'thermochronological evaluation', which is a key insight to investigating fluid flow and mass transfer in the rock mass. The t-T path shows whether cooling was slow or rapid from thermal conditions of solidification/crystallization to the biotite K-Ar closure temperature; parts of the pluton that cooled slowly correspond to parts with high frequencies of fractures, and vice versa. The absolute value for duration between the zircon U-Pb age evaluated from the oscillatory-zoned area (OZ age) and biotite K-Ar age shows high correlation with fracture frequency (R-2 = 0.89), and thus gives a quantitative indicator for evaluating fracture frequency; longer duration accompanies higher frequency. A combination of thermochronological evaluation, the local cooling indicator, and the lithofacies effect can be applied as potential diagnostic tools for detailed evaluation of the fracture population.

AB In order to improve the possibility of correct interpretation of some geophysical phenomena such seismology, it is important to reduce systematic errors such as common mode error (CME) and multipath errors, and to improve the accuracy of high-rate (1-5 Hz) displacements. This paper focuses on accuracy enhancement and noise assessment of high-rate Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) position time series of regional network of GNSS stations. Complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition-based multiscale multiway principal component analysis (C-MSMPCA) denoising method is introduced to denoise the high-rate (1-5 Hz) GNSS position time series, whose performance was compared with those of modified sidereal filtering (MSF), stacking filtering, PCA and the recently developed multiscale multiway PCA (MSMPCA). It turns out that C-MSMPCA can significantly eliminate the high-frequency random noise and remove the low-frequency CME, and other systematic errors such as multipath errors. Furthermore, for denoising high-rate GNSS time series, C-MSMPCA is more precise than the other denoising methods. Irrespective of sampling rates and data processing strategies, C-MSMPCA can respectively reach the accuracy of submillimeter- and millimeter-levels on the horizontal and vertical components of high-rate GNSS displacements. Spectral analysis on the 1 Hz coordinate time series from the Sichuan GNSS Continuous Observing Network of China suggests that Gauss-Markov process is an adequate noise model for the noise characteristics of the filtered GNSS data using MSMPCA and C-MSMPCA. The CME magnitudes of MSMPCA are 2.61, 2.55, and 6.72 mm (east, north, and vertical), and those of C-MSMPCA are 2.69, 2.80, and 7.80 mm, respectively.

TI Subsurface imaging of the Harrat Lunayyir 2007-2009 earthquake swarm

ID BENEATH
AB The Harrat Lunayyir (HL) 2007-2009 earthquake swarm has attracted much scientific interest mainly due to its occurrence within the Large Igneous Province (LIP) of Saudi Arabia. Qualitative interpretation of aeromagnetic anomalies is suggestive of linear dike-like anomalies, striking NW-SE, across the earthquake swarm zone (ESZ). Residual Bouguer anomaly data for HL range between - 4.3 and 1.5 mgal and show a 20 km-wide gravity low flanked by lateral gravity highs. The axial-zone of low gravity corresponds to the ESZ cluster. Employing a three-dimensional (3D) inversion of the residual gravity field with a one-dimensional (1D) P-wave velocity model as a proxy for background density variations with depth, we imaged a mid-to-upper crustal low density zone ( > 10 km depth). We interpret this zone as the source area of ascending magma that intruded into the upper crust underlying the HL during the 2009 seismic crisis. The inversion also highlights lower than average density rocks beneath the western parts of the HL whereas its eastern part is composed of rocks of higher density. The 3D magnetic inversions lead us to infer magmatic intrusion of lower magnetic susceptibility at this locality extending vertically from 1.57 km altitude (above sea level) to its bottom edge at 10.8 km depth (below sea level). Based on these results, the 2007-2009 ESZ is likely associated with rift-related extension associated with the Red Sea spreading, where a trans-crustal magmatic plumbing system extends to depths of about 10 km beneath the centre of HL.

AB P receiver functions (PRFs) and the H-k stacking technique are tools often used to constrain the thickness of the crust and the ratio between the velocities of P and S waves. Both the crustal depth and the Poisson's ratio are very important parameters to study the tectonic evolution of the lithosphere, but they can be significantly affected by the presence of crustal anisotropy. In order to address this problem, we have extended the isotropic stacking approach to include six converted P-to-S phases that are generated in the anisotropic case, instead of only three phases considered in the isotropic case, and we have examined the feasibility of the stacking technique using synthetic and real data. Based on PRFs acquired by 108 permanent broadband seismic stations deployed in the southeastern margin of Tibet including the Sichuan and Yunnan areas, we have applied the anisotropic H-k stacking scheme to investigate the crustal thickness and Poisson's ratio. The results reveal that the crustal thickness varies from similar to 60 km in the Songpan-Ganzi fold system and the northern part of the Sichuan-Yunnan diamond-shaped block, near the Eastern Himalayan Syntaxis, to similar to 33 km in southern Yunnan, and that the Poisson's ratio varies mostly from 0.24 to 0.32. The highest values of 0.28-0.30 are found along the axis formed by the Longmenshan fault, the Lijiang-Jinhe fault and the Xiaojiang fault, and are attributed to the accumulation of lower crustal flow in front of the Sichuan Basin. The highest value of similar to 0.32 is observed at the Tengchong volcano area to the north of the Indochina block, and is attributed to the upwelling of hot mantle associated to the eastward subduction of the Indian plate, rather than to the expansion of east Tibet. Comparing with the results provided by the isotropic stacking scheme, it is appreciated that the crustal depth determined by the anisotropic stacking method well adjusts the observed pattern of gravity anomaly. We conclude that the results obtained by anisotropic stacking yield a much better constraint on the estimation of the crustal depth and Poisson's ratio when compared to those achieved by isotropic stacking.

TI Crustal thickness and velocity structure of Malay Peninsula inferred
   from joint inversion of receiver functions and surface waves dispersion
SO JOURNAL OF ASIAN EARTH SCIENCES

DE Receiver function; Crustal thickness; Velocity structure; Malay
   Peninsula
ID OREGON
AB The Malay Peninsula is located within the Sunda shelf that is subdivided geologically into three distinctive tectonic belts; western, central and eastern belts. The north-south orientation of these belts was formed during the Paleo-Tethys subduction process in the Late Paleozoic. Bentong-Raub suture zone separates the central and western belts. While extensive studies have been conducted at the surface and near surface scale, the subsurface model of the Earth's crust and upper mantle layers within this region are relatively few. Crustal structure model is crucial in investigating the cause of local earthquakes, which shocked Peninsular Malaysia between 2007 and 2009. The present study is conducted adopting the joint inversion of the P-wave receiver functions and surface wave dispersions techniques using the data collected from eight Seismological stations in the Malay Peninsula. The receiver function for each station was computed using over a thousand tele-seismic earthquake waveforms, recorded by the three-component broadband seismometers. For each station, the H-k was used to determine the Vp/Vs ratio and the depth to the Moho. This step was conducted to have an initial constraint for the crustal thickness. For the surface wave dispersion calculations, on the other hand, two hundred local and regional earthquakes with focal depth less than 30 km and with magnitudes mb 6.0 and above that occurred along SouthEast Asia's ring of fire were analyzed. The analyses obtained from these two techniques were jointly inverted through a two-phases of velocity inversion to determine the 1-D velocity profile for each station. The results of inversion indicate that the Moho boundary is getting shallower towards the north of Malay Peninsula, as a 26 km depth of crust-mantle boundary were determined in station SKLT south Thailand. Furthermore, the subsurface profile of the western belt of Malay Peninsula was also found to be highly complicated, with complex receiver function responses being computed beneath the IPM and KUM stations where slow velocity zones are identified within the 10-20 km crustal depth. The region in southern Thailand might also have originated from Indochina/ East Malaya block, due to similar crustal velocity characteristics found beneath the region compared to the area beneath KOM, JRM and BTDF stations in the southern part of Malay Peninsula and Singapore. The Vp/Vs ratios for the crust indicate that the crust is generally undisturbed except for station SKLT south Thailand. This may indicate that the occurrence of a large earthquake in the region is not likely.

AB Early Palaeozoic ophiolites emplaced in the central East Kunlun fault zone (CEKF) offer critical clues to the tectonic evolution of the Proto-Tethys ocean and the accretionary process of CEKF. The Qushi'ang Ophiolite, located within the eastern segment of the CEKF, consists of dismembered serpentinites, meta-gabbros and metabasalts. This study presents petrologic, whole-rock geochemical, and in situ zircon U-Pb and Hf isotope data for basic rocks (both metagabbros and metabasalts) from the Qushi'ang ophiolite to constrain the formation age and tectonic setting of the ophiolite. Zircons from two meta-gabbro samples yield concordant U-Pb ages of ca. 498 Ma and ca. 505 Ma, indicating that the Qushi'ang ophiolite was formed in the late Cambrian. The metagabbros and meta-basalts show significant enrichment in large ionic lithophile elements (LILEs), such as Cs, Rb, Ba, U, and Pb, and depletion in high field strength elements (HFSEs), such as Nb, Ta, Zr, and Ti, suggesting the influence of fluids derived from a subducting oceanic slab. On the N-MORB normalized trace element diagrams, these rocks share similar features with arc basalts and back-arc basalts and far away from fore-arc basalts (FABs) and normal mid-ocean basalts (N-MORBs). Low zircon epsilon(Hf) (t) values (- 2.9 to + 0.2) for the meta-gabbros further indicate that the Qushi'ang ophiolite likely originated from an weakly enriched mantle wedge source. Geochemical discrimination diagrams show that the Qushi'ang ophiolite formed in a back arc basin setting. Our new analyses, combined with previous data, suggest that the Qushi'ang ophiolite represents a relict of a nascent back-arc basin, similar to the scenario of the Okinawa trough in Western Pacific.

AB On November 18, 2017, a moderate to strong earthquake occurred at Mainling County, Nyingchi City, Tibet, which was the first moderate earthquake in the Eastern Himalayan Syntaxis (EHS) region in the past five decades. To gain a better understanding of the rupture mechanism and seismogenic structure of this earthquake, the rupture process through a joint inversion of far-field body wave data and Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) data was present in this study. In addition, the three-dimensional (3D) crustal density structure of the EHS area was inverted using the gravity data. According to the joint inversion results of the rupture process, the Mainling earthquake lasted approximately 18 s and released energy of 8.32 x 10(18) N m (Mw 6.5). The rupture was dominated by the thrust movement. The maximum slip was approximately 0.83 m, and the slip distribution was mainly concentrated at depths of 5-15 km in two patches. According to the results of gravity inversion, the density structure has good constraints on the source depth. The Mainling earthquake's epicenter was located near the junction of high and low density areas. Its rupture extended over nearly 40 km in the ESE direction along the fault strike. In addition, the density structure also clearly shows a uniform density anomaly in this region, which may be beneficial to the release of seismic energy. The clockwise deformation of the erosion effect in the EHS superimposed over the uplifting and thrusting motion of the Namche Barwa (NB) area, and the Northward Indentation effect of the Indian block. All of these processes have strengthened folding deformation and the accumulated of stress and an abnormally high-density concentration within the NB area. The sudden release of accumulated stress led to the occurrence of the Mainling earthquake. These are the seismogenic structure of the NB zone. The regional structure and material characteristics indicates that the Dongjiu segment of the Dongjiu-Mainling Shear Zones (DMSZ) lies in the density anomaly gradient belt, with high density, low velocity, and high resistance media on its northeastern side, which benefits the stress accumulation. The earthquake activity and risks of this segment merits further attention.

AB The present study combined spatial distribution and mechanism of seismicity, seismicity parameters, geomorphology in satellite imagery and tectonic features in Makran inland to show that the Makran low angle thrust fault is divided into two separate segments. Depth dispersal of earthquakes, especially relocated events, shows that the sinking plate is steeper in the west than in the east of Makran. Significant facts were identified from the variation of Moho depth between west and east, slip rates of the inland faults and crustal shortenings in the north of Makran. The Sistan suture zone plays a significant role in dividing the overriding plate into a non-deforming Helmand block and a less deforming Lut block. These blocks have different resistances against the northward subduction. Large and great events, such as the 1989 Chabahar (M-w 5.5) and 1945 Gwadur (M-w 8.1), occurred in the south of subduction fronts of the western and eastern Makran, respectively. They occurred in shallow depth and were the pieces of evidence of weak and strong coupling between the oceanic and continental crusts on a low angle and a very low angle reverse faults, respectively. Spectral analysis and depth determination of the instrumental and pre instrumental earthquakes, respectively, helped to separate some plate boundary and intraplate events. This separation, geometry and non-characteristic behavior of the subduction zone, revealed from spatial and temporal distribution of the earthquakes, probably dedicate a mature Aleutian type for the subduction zone in the east. Missing great (M > 6.1) earthquakes, less slip rate of the continental faults and steeper dipping of the sinking plate in the west probably indicate a Kurile type for the Iranian part of subduction. Makran is a bimodal subduction, because geomorphological and seismic pieces of evidence indicate a NNW surficial and right lateral fracture zone in the continental crust and a NW deep and left lateral fracture zone in the oceanic crust, respectively. The fractures and geometry of subductions showed that the eastern Makran has seismotectonically a wider area for potential coupling of a larger earthquake than the western Makran.

AB The Helanshan Tectonic Belt is situated among the Qilian Orogenic Belt to the southwest, the Alxa Massif to the west and the Ordos Block to the east. The Helanshan Tectonic Belt has received increasing attention since it was argued as the plate boundary separating the Alxa Massif from the Ordos Block, and hence Alxa Massif was isolated from the North China Craton during Triassic. The Middle to Upper Triassic strata in the northwestern Ordos and the Helanshan Tectonic Belt witnessed the tectonic evolutionary processes between the Alxa Massif and the Ordos Basin, hence are pivotal to understand the relationship between the Alxa Massif and the North China Craton. In this work, integrated paleocurrent orientation, gravel component, sandstone modal composition and detrital zircon U-Pb isotopic analyses were applied to trace the source area and reconstruct the sourceto-sink relations between the Abca Massif and Ordos Basin. The southeast orientated paleocurrent directions suggest detritus in the northwestern Ordos were mostly sourced from the northwest. Clastic compositions reveal a mixed orogeny provenance, including magmatic arc and continental block sources. Detrital zircons from four sandstones in the Helanshan Tectonic Belt yields four major LA-ICPMS U-Pb age groups of 2600-2200 Ma, 2000-1700 Ma, 480-400 Ma and 350-200 Ma, suggesting multiple-sourced provenance. Comparing to the magmatic records in the Alxa Massif and the Qilian Orogenic Belt, the Triassic detritus in the Helanshan Tectonic Belt were mainly from the Alxa Massif with additional supplements from the Qilian Orogenic Belt, which finally debouched to the lacustrine in the interior Ordos Basin to the southeast. Triassic basin evolution of the northwestern Ordos was further associated with post-collision in the Alxa Massif after the closure of the Paleo-Asian Ocean.

AB Bedrock channel profile analysis is a robust reconnaissance tool for examining the rates and patterns of deformation in active orogens. Here, steepness and concavity indices were extracted from bedrock channels draining the northern Qilian Mountains based on the universal shear stress incision model. The profile analysis reveals a systematic spatial distribution of steepness and concavity indices. The average steepness index for channels draining the western part is approximately 1.6 times higher than that for the eastern part. Through empirical calibration of erosion coefficient K, the influence of channel width, rock strength, discharge and sediment flux are identified, and an approximately 1.1-1.2 times difference in K values is found between the west and east under the hypothesis that lithologic resistance and sediment flux have no contribution. Correlating profile analyses with parameter calibration, an approximate 2-3 times increase in the rock uplift rate is found from the eastern part to the western part of the orogen. The integration of this study with previous work in the eastern part of the mountains indicates that cross-strike (2-4 times) and along-strike (2-3 times) differential rock uplift both exist in the northeastern margin of the Tibetan Plateau. In addition, the abnormal values of concavity are apparently associated with the channels transecting large thrust fault zones. Thus, the shortening deformation may play a dominant role in controlling the differential rock uplift through folding and thrusting of the northeast-directed thrust faults across the northeastern margin of the Tibetan Plateau.

AB High resolution satellite derived Free Air Gravity (FAG) anomalies over the Maldive Ridge segment of the Chagos-Laccadive Ridge and adjoining areas of the Arabian Basin and Central Indian Basin was analyzed to understand their structure. Indian Ocean Geoidal Low corrected FAG depict the N-S trending relative highs associated with the Maldive Ridge, the lows associated with the Vishnu Fracture Zone, and the seafloor fabrics associated with spreading Central Indian Ridge in the Arabian Basin. Transformation operations for enhancing the short, intermediate and long wavelength anomalies were carried out. The northward continuation of the Vishnu Fracture Zone, the eastward extension of the fracture zones of the Arabian Basin into the Deep Sea Channel (DSC) region, between the Maldive Ridge and the Chagos Bank, and the signatures related to north-south trending coral reefs have been deciphered from the enhancement of short wavelength anomalies. The long wavelength anomalies show N-S highs along the axis of the Maldive Ridge and the DSC, which on comparison with previous studies, is inferred to be the signature related with the underplated material from the passage of the Indian plate over the Reunion Plume. Depth to top of two interfaces over the Maldive Ridge and the DSC were computed using the power spectral method by assuming a window of 110 km dimension and SO km overlap. Depths were thus calculated for 44 blocks along the ridge axis. The average depth to the top of the shallow interface was found to be 5.5 km while that of the deeper was 11.0 km. These depths and interfaces were confirmed by undertaking 2D forward modelling along a 300 km long N-S profile along the western segment of the Maldive Ridge. Integrating with the available previous geophysical studies, it is inferred that the shallow interface represents the depth to the top of the acoustic basement underlying 1-1.5 km thick lava flow unit while the deeper is associated with the interface between the crust and initial Moho before the underplating took place (presently top of the underplated material). From the present study, it has been inferred that the Deep Sea Channel between the Maldive Ridge and Chagos Bank can be purely oceanic in nature.

AB The Pusangguo skarn Cu-polymetallic deposit is a newly discovered deposit in the western Gangdese porphyry copper belt (GPCB). The orebodies are hosted along the contact between limestone of the Early Cretaceous Taken Formation and a biotite granodiorite intrusion. The mineralization is associated with the biotite granodiorite intrusion and is divided into four-stages: (1) a prograde skam stage; (2) a pre-ore retrograde skarn stage; (3) a quartz-sulfides stage; and (4) a post-ore carbonate stage. These skarns have the characteristics of both calcareous and manganese skams. The mineral compositions of the garnets and pyroxenes indicate that the oreforming environment gradually evolved from a high-temperature, oxidative and alkaline environment into a low-temperature and reductive environment. The sulfur and lead isotopic compositions of the ore sulfides suggest a magmatic source for the sulfur and a crust-dominated source for the ore-forming metals. The hydrogen and oxygen isotopic compositions of the quartz and garnets in the ores indicate that the ore-forming fluids may have originated from a mixture of magmatic and meteoric fluids. The geochronological data show that both the magmatism (14.8 +/- 0.4 Ma) and mineralization (13.2 +/- 0.7 Ma) occurred during the Miocene in a post-collisional tectonic setting. The ore-forming biotite granodiorite is a high-K calc-alkaline I-type granite and has an adakitic geochemical affinity similar to the Gangdese Miocene adakites, which were generated from thickened lower crust in a post-collisional tectonic setting. The low positive epsilon(Hf) (t) values (0 to +2.6), young two-stage Hf model zircon ages, and whole-rock geochemical and lead isotopic compositions indicate that the magma of the ore-related biotite granodiorite may have originated from the thickened lower crust in the Lhasa terrane.

AB The Mikabu greenstones form accreted fragments of an ancient oceanic plateau, which are currently incorporated within the Cretaceous high P/T-type Sanbagawa metamorphic belt in SW Japan. Previous geological and petrological studies indicate that protoliths of the Mikabu greenstones were mafic/ultramafic volcanoplutonic rocks of oceanic plateau and/or islands. Despite their rock assemblage and metamorphic nature, their protolith age has been poorly constrained. By measuring U-Pb age of igneous zircon grains using LA-ICPMS, this study identified for the first time a Late Jurassic age for the protoliths of the Mikabu greenstones in the eastern Kii Peninsula (the Shurei complex). With an overlap within 2-sigma error, measured U-Pb ages of zircon grains have a weighted mean age of 154.6 +/- 1.6 Ma (the Kimmeridgian, Late Jurassic), which is slightly younger than the radiolarian ages (Middle Jurassic) of deep-sea pelagic cherts associated with the Mikabu greenstones. This age difference indicates that mafic magmas intruded pelagic deep-sea sediments to form a volcanic edifice onto the pre-existing oceanic lithosphere. New measurements of trace element composition of the dated zircon grains further confirmed that the dated zircon grains are more similar to those in oceanic crusts rather than in continental crusts. In addition, the trace element composition suggests that the host mafic magma of the zircon grains was derived from depleted mantle similar to the mid-oceanic ridge-type source, rather than fertile mantle source like Hawaii and Iceland. On the basis of the common occurrence of similar mafic rocks from the Shatsky Rise in the modem NW Pacific Ocean, we conclude that the protoliths of the Mikabu greenstones had formed a part of an oceanic plateau/island, which was generated by the Late Jurassic infra-plate mafic magmatism in ancient mid-Pacific, probably together with the Shatzky Rise.

AB The empirical accelerograms of the September 18, 2011, Sikkim earthquake (M-w = 6.9) have been used in the present study to estimate its source parameters and to identify a representative relation for the attenuation of peak ground acceleration with distance. The spectra of high energy packets observed in the SH waves (approximated by transverse components of accelerograms) has been modeled using Brune's model. A two-step procedure has been adopted for this purpose. The estimated source parameters of the 2011 Sikkim earthquake have been found to be as - corner frequency (f(c)): 0.09 Hz, seismic moment (M-0): (2.43 +/- 0.5) x 10(26) dyne-cm, stress drop (Delta sigma): 50.4 +/- 9.28 bars, and the moment magnitude (M-w): 6.87 +/- 0.05. These estimated values have been found to be consistent with those of reported values obtained using different data sets and procedures. The high-frequency earthquake ground motions are governed by stress drop at the source. Therefore a value of stress drop estimated here is useful for the simulation of earthquake strong ground motions in the region. The attenuation characteristics of observed peak ground acceleration as a function of distance have been compared with those of obtained using five empirical relations. It has been found that a relation given by McGuire (1978) represents the attenuation characteristics of peak ground acceleration is relatively better. This relation may be used for estimating the peak ground acceleration of similar magnitude for future earthquakes in the region. This relation is also useful for the simulation of earthquake strong ground motions in the region using envelope technique. The outcome of the present study is useful for the estimation of the seismic hazard of the Sikkim region of the Himalaya.

TI Coseismic displacement of the 5 April 2017 Mashhad earthquake (Mw 6.1)

AB The outward expansion of the northeastern Iranian Plateau is mainly accommodated by a series of widely distributed range-normal thrust and range-parallel strike-slip faults. However, the role of the strike-slip faults in this region's strain-partitioning kinematics remains unclear. The occurrence of the 5 April 2017 Mw 6.1 Mashhad earthquake provides us a rare opportunity to study this topic because this earthquake struck the southern Binalud Mountains, which are experiencing an oblique convergence between the northward-moving Lut Block and the NW-striking Binalud and Kopeh Dagh mountain ranges. We process two paired ascending and descending Sentinel-1A radar-image observations to determine the relative contributions from the dip and strike-dip subcomponents in such an oblique collisional domain. The interferograms along the line-of-sight direction and their converted horizontal and vertical displacements indicate that a thrust with a right-lateral strike-slip fault controlled the rupture process of the Mashhad earthquake, with the maximum dextral shearing and vertical displacements reaching 19.5 cm and 14 cm, respectively. Coseismic surface deformation measurements are also used to estimate the fault geometry and invert the slip distribution along the underlying seismogenic fault. Our best-fit faulting model suggests that the coseismic rupture occurred on a fault plane with a dip angle of 37.5 degrees and strike angle of 324 degrees. The strike-slip subcomponent was more significant than the dip-slip, approaching similar to 95 cm, and the dip-slip varied from 10 cm to 47 cm. The seismic-moment release of our preferred fault model is 1.71 x 10(18) Nm, equivalent to a Mw 6.16 earthquake event. We also use the preferred fault model to calculate the Coulomb failure stress (CFS) change at the nearby receiver faults. Combined with an analysis of historical earthquakes and the consistent dextral river deflections along the strike-slip fault systems of the southern Binalud and Kopeh Dagh Mountains, we speculate that the seismogenic structure that triggered the Mashhad earthquake should have been one strand fault of the NW-SE-striking Kashafrud fault system. The strike-slip faults in NE Iran play an important role in accommodating the lateral transport of crustal material from the convergence front of the Lut Block and Binalud fragments and providing commonly distributed anticlockwise rotation around a vertical axis.

AB The Karing Volcanic Complex and the Dusunbaru Pluton comprise an Early Permian volcanic-plutonic centre in the Volcanic-Plutonic Arc on the western margin of the Kluet-Kuantan basin of the West Sumatra Block in Sumatra, Indonesia. The Karing Volcanic Complex is mostly composed of 'Monotonous Intermediate Type' tuffs which interfinger with the volcaniclastics and coastal and marine sediments of the Mengkarang Formation. Eight lithological Intervals each commencing with tuffs overlain by volcaniclastics and sediments, have been mapped in the Merangin river section. The climax of the volcanicity occurred in Interval IV. In the waning stages of volcanism basalt flows were extruded and the volcanic pile was eroded by lahars and debris flows. Zircon CAIDTMS dates from tuff beds at the base and top of the section bracket the volcanic activity as having taken place over a period of 630,000 years within the Asselian Stage of the Permian. The Dusunbaru pluton is composed of Gabbroids, Granitoids with subordinate Metabasalts and Metatuffs occurring as xenoliths. These lithologies are present as lithic clasts within the Karing Volcanic Complex tuffs, and it is considered that the Dusunbaru Pluton represents a former magma chamber from which the tuffs were vented. The Mildly-alkaline to Sub-alkaline Metabasalts and Gabbroids, were derived from the N-MORB sector of the lithospheric 'Mantle Array' while the compositions of the Granitoids (including gabbroid-granitoid hybrid rocks) were influenced by the reaction of basic magmas with the lower crust. The Sub-alkaline and High-K Late Basalt Lava flows were derived from the melting of basalt below the crust-mantle interface. The rock suites were variably hydrated as a result of alterations. Magmatic alteration has affected the Metabasalts, Gabbroids, Granitoids, their xenoliths and the Late Basalts. Hydrothermal alteration has weakly affected the aubaerial tuffs and strongly changed the mineralogy of some of the Late Basalt flows, in particular the entablatures. The chemistry of the Dusunbaru Pluton is of Cordilleran-type, typical of continent margin volcanic-plutonic arcs. The Dusunbaru Pluton was likely originally emplaced at the interface between the Kuantan Formation (Visean to Permian) and a Proterozoic gneissic basement. A late hydrothermal event/tectonic event during which the Dusunbaru Pluton was faulted against the Karing Volcanic Complex, is attributed to the collision of the Woyla oceanic terrains with Sumatra in the latemid Cretaceous. The stratigraphy of the West Sumatra Volcanic Arc and the Kluet-Kuantan Basin resembles that of the Sukhothai Volcanic Arc and associated basin sediments in the Indochina Block. A palaeogeographical reconstruction suggests that the West Sumatra Block originally was an appendage to the Indochina Block at a palaeolatitude between 5 and 15 degrees S.

AB Southeastward strain transfer in the middle-southern Longmen Shan (LMS) thrust belt not only can promote the development of fault-related folds and earthquakes in the piedmont, but also affect the seismogenic capacity of the middle-southern LMS thrust belt. However, the detailed transfer process remains elusive. In this work, we combine structural profile re-analysis, sandbox modeling and seismic statistics to illustrate the strain transfer process. Our main results indicate that: (1) the thickness of the shallow detachment (e.g. Middle-Lower Triassic gypsum-salt strata) is probably the main factor for differences in southeastward strain transfer within the domain between the middle-southern LMS thrust belt and Weiyuan-Moxi anticline. This is also supported by our sandbox model; (2) the seismogenic capacity in the southern LMS thrust belt is probably proportional to the corresponding shortening of the Range Front Blind Thrust (REST). Thus, seismogenic capacity in the seismic gap zone is weaker than those of other segments of the southern LMS thrust belt, which is probably < Ms 7.0. (3) The weak seismogenic capacity (< Ms 7.0) and formation of the seismic gap is probably attributed to weak petrophysical properties and enhanced southeastward strain transfer. It is worth noting that the 1970 Dayi Ms 6.2 earthquake probably released most energy of the seismic gap. Further, this work also sheds light on the evaluation of seismic hazard in the LMS and other orogenic belts.

AB Loess soils typically have an open and metastable structure. Humidification and vibration can modify their microstructure and thus influence their mechanical behavior. In the present study, to investigate the influence of train vibration on the tensile strength behavior of loess, the tensile tests were performed on loess specimens that had been vibrated at a low amplitude for a long period using a modified horizontal extensograph. In addition, the microstructures of vibrated and non-vibrated loess specimens before and after the tensile tests were characterized, changes in the loess microstructure due to vibration and that in the tensile test were analyzed. The results show that the relationship between uniaxial tensile strength and water content in soil specimen could be represented using a power function. The axial displacement at failure varies at the same manner as tensile strength with respect to water content. In comparison to intact loess, occurrence of less clay bridges and clay buttresses between aggregates or coarse particles is identified in the disturbed specimens. While aggregates are seen to be a very little more loose in vibrated specimens after the tensile tests than that before the tensile tests. This indicates that vibration reduces the tension-resistance and ductility of loess soil structure, which could be attributed to loss of bonding strength as a result of breakage of clay cementations and disintegration of aggregates. In the tensile test, the soil structure goes through two distinct phases of change, i.e., stretching phase and cracking phase. In the stretching phase, the tensile deformations take place throughout the specimen without altering the contacts between soil particles significantly. In the cracking phase, weak cementations fail to resist tensile deformation and suffer from breakage; once a through-crack is developed, the specimen breaks in two, leading to a catastrophic drop of tensile stress.

AB The early Paleoproterozoic is an essential period for understanding the early tectonic evolution of the Yangtze Block and its reconstruction in the Columbia supercontinent, whereas these issues are largely unknown due to the scarce preservation of early Paleoproterozoic geological records. This study presents rarely reported early Paleoproterozoic granitoids from the southwestern Yangtze Block, with integrated studies of zircon U-Pb ages, Lu-Hf isotopic compositions and whole-rock geochemistry. Magmatic zircon U-Pb dating for two monzogranite samples yields weighted mean Pb-207/Pb-206 ages of 2359 +/- 16 Ma and 2363 +/- 16 Ma, providing unambiguous evidence for the presence of early Paleoproterozoic magmatism in the Yangtze Block. All the samples have high A/CNK values of 1.30-1.61, typical of S-type granite. These rocks have low total REE contents of 72.5-139 ppm with marked enrichment in LREEs ((La/Yb)(N) = 10.73-23.83) and conspicuously negative Eu anomalies (Eu/Eu* = 0.46-0.55). The rocks exhibit uniform primitive mantle-normalized trace element patterns with enrichment in Rb, Th, U and Pb and depletion in Sr, Nb, Hf and Ti. These dated zircon grains have consistent negative epsilon(Hf)(t) values of -6.2 to -2.8 and T-DM2 ages of ca. 2.97-3.16 Ga, indicative of Mesoarchean crustal materials as their magma source. Considering the existence of the ca. 2.36 Ga regional high-grade tectono-metamorphic event, we propose that the ca. 2.36 Ga monzogranites were most likely generated in the early stage of post-collisional extension. Therefore, the southwestern Yangtze Block likely experienced a collision event during ca. 2.40-2.36 Ga, indicative of the involvement of the Yangtze Block in the ca. 2.5-2.3 Ga Arrowsmith orogeny of Laurentia. In addition, a series of accretionary events might also have occurred in the western Yangtze Block before the final assembly of the Columbia supercontinent, implying a tight spatial connection between the Yangtze Block and northwestern Laurentia within this global-scale supercontinent.

AB Paleoproterozoic mafic dikes from the Kongling Complex in South China provide an ideal opportunity to examine mantle properties and tectonic evolution of the Yangtze Block and thus to understand the paleo-position of South China in the Columbia supercontinent. The 2.0 Ga dikes are the oldest mafic intrusions identified in the Yangtze Block by far. Samples from the dikes consist of fine to medium-grained dolerite and have variable SiO2 (43.48-52.61 wt%) and MgO contents (3.17-7.35 wt%), They are enriched in LREE and show slightly negative to positive Eu anomalies (Eu/Eu* = 0.85-1.06). Their primitive mantle-normalized trace element patterns are characterized by enrichment of large-ion lithophile elements (Rb, Ba, Pb) and depletion of high-field-strength elements (U, Nb, Ta, Ti). Rocks from the dikes have variable initial Sr-87/Sr-86 ratios (0.698874-0.710753), epsilon Nd values (- 3.0 to +4.1) and zircon epsilon Hf values (- 2.7 to + 3.4). These geochemical features indicate that their parental magmas were formed by < 10% partial melting of a spinel-bearing lherzolite mantle in a back-arc basin setting. Paleoproterozoic mafic rocks from South China, Northwest Laurentia, Northwest Australia and Siberia had different trace element ratios and crystallization ages, their mantles had different thermal states. Thus, we argue against the previous model that the four continents were assembled together in the Columbia supercontinent.

DE Bow hunter syndrome; Diagnosis; Perfusion computed tomography;
   Provocative test; Vertebrobasilar insufficiency
AB Bow hunter syndrome (BHS) is a rare vascular phenomenon of vertebrobasilar insufficiency caused by dynamic stenosis of the vertebral artery (VA) by osteophytes, fibrous bands, or disk herniation with neck rotation. We present a rare case of a patient with bilaterally patent VAs on neutral imaging and bilateral dynamic compression of VA with left head rotation. Provocation tests are critical toward understanding dynamic pathophysiology of BHS because normal neutral vascular imaging does not preclude diagnosis of BHS. Although dynamic angiography is the gold standard for diagnosis of BHS, cerebral angiography could be invasive and risky. Provocative test using perfusion computed tomography scan is a simple and noninvasive method to assess BHS on an outpatient basis.

TI A Very Rare Case of Right Insular Lobe Langerhans Cell Histiocytosis
   (CD1a(+)) Mimicking Glioblastoma Multiforme in a Young Adult
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY

ID THERAPY
AB BACKGROUND: Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH) is a multisystemic dendritic cell proliferation that is relatively uncommon in adults. Central nervous system LCH outside the pituitary gland is even more uncommon.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: We report the case of a 42-year-old man who had complained of right-side hemicranial pain and left arm minor paresis. The symptoms were due to a right insular lobe heterogeneous-enhancing lesion associated with extensive vasogenic edema. The first diagnostic impression suggested glioblastoma multiforme or localized metastasis. The thoracic, abdominal, pelvic computed tomography scan only detected small upper lung inactive nodules suggesting silent focal LCH. A very hard lesion was almost completely removed through a pterional craniotomy approach, with no fluorescence after aminolevulinic acid infusion. The intraoperative biopsy findings ruled out glioma but could not confirm lymphoma. The definitive cerebral biopsy findings showed lymphocytes and histiocytes (CD1a(+), S-1001(+)), with a diagnosis of intracerebral parenchymal LCH. Fractioned radiotherapy resulted in clinical and radiological remission.
   CONCLUSIONS: The present case is so rare it should not be used as a guide. We probably will never see a single intraparenchymal supratentorial central nervous system LCH lesion. However, we hope our report will help colleagues in the future with the thought process.

AB BACKGROUND: Spasticity and muscle weakness are common severe neurologic sequelae after stroke. Contralateral peripheral neurotization has been applied successfully to promote motor function of the hemiplegic upper extremity in patients with central neurological injury. To our knowledge, we present the first report of contralateral lumbar to sacral nerve transfer for the lower extremities in hemiplegic patients after stroke.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: Two patients were enrolled in the study. The first patient is a 57-year-old man who experienced permanent muscle weakness in his left leg after a right cerebral infarction. The second patient is a 42-year-old man who had spasticity and hemiplegia in both upper and lower limbs on the right side 32 months after a left cerebral hemorrhage. Both patients underwent contralateral lumbaretoesacral nerve rerouting to improve lower-limb motor function. Twenty months after surgery, both patients experienced significant improvement in ambulatory status.
   CONCLUSIONS: Although long-term follow-up and a randomized controlled trial are required, this study demonstrates the safety and possible benefits of contralateral lumbaretoesacral nerve transfer for hemiplegic patients after stroke. This novel surgical approach could provide a new means for lower-limb motor functional recovery.

ID ENDOVASCULAR TREATMENT; SOLITAIRE STENT; RECANALIZATION; OCCLUSIONS;
   TRIAL
AB BACKGROUND: Vessel perforation is a serious technical complication during mechanical thrombectomy (MT) for the treatment of acute ischemic stroke with large vessel occlusion. Routine rescue strategy includes balloon occlusion for tamponade, procedure suspension, and lowering or normalizing blood pressure. However, this complication is still associated with poor outcome and high mortality.
   METHODS: In this paper, the authors report their experience by using glue to embolize the ruptured vessel secondary to microcatheter/microwire perforation, preventing further deterioration in clinical outcome. Rescue glue embolization was attempted in 2 patients who developed intraprocedural vessel perforation while trying to gain access through the blocked artery with a microcatheter/microwire.
   RESULTS: The ruptured vessels were effectively occluded. Stent retriever thrombectomies were then continued, and TICI 2b and 3 recanalizations were achieved. Both patients' neurologic status improved.
   CONCLUSIONS: The key benefit of this method exists in embolizing the ruptured vessel without affecting the following MT. We propose the rescue glue embolization is simple yet effective in managing vessel perforation complication during MT.

DT Article

   Myelomeningocele; Revision; Ventriculoatrial shunt
ID PLACEMENT; RETRIEVAL
AB BACKGROUND: Myelomeningocele patients with shunt-dependent hydrocephalus often require multiple shunt revisions, eventually exhausting first-line distal diversion sites. Ventriculoatrial (VA) shunts are used less commonly than ventriculoperitoneal shunts, but knowledge of their use and complications is important to the neurosurgeon's armamentarium. VA shunts differ from ventriculoperitoneal and ventriculopleural shunts in that the ideal distal catheter target is an anatomically small area in comparison with the peritoneal and pleural cavities.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: Here we present a case of an adult myelomeningocele patient who experienced migration of a distal VA shunt catheter. A minimally invasive revision technique that does not require recannulation of the vessels or open manipulation of the shunt is presented.
   CONCLUSIONS: This is the fourth reported instance of successful distal revision of a migrated VA shunt catheter via transfemoral endovascular snaring. Knowledge of the opportunities afforded by this technique and collaboration with thoracic surgery colleagues is of benefit to all neurosurgeons.

AB BACKGROUND: It was known that a small number of patients could have intracranial aneurysm recurrences after either surgical clipping or endovascular embolization treatment. However, early recurrence within 1 month after the treatment and re-recurrence has rarely been reported before.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: We report a 46-year-old man with a medical history of smoking and hypertension who was noncompliant with the treatments. He presented to the hospital with right extremity paralysis and aphasia and was found to have a ruptured middle cerebral artery aneurysm. Aneurysm was successfully treated by surgical clipping. Within 1 month after the treatment, the patient had a recurrent aneurysm at the same location and intracranial hemorrhage. The recurrent aneurysm was treated by endovascular embolization. However, during the follow-up visit 8 months after the treatment, angiography showed aneurysm recurrence with proximal vascular stenosis.
   CONCLUSIONS: Re-recurrence of intracranial aneurysm could happen after initial successful treatment with surgical clipping and endovascular embolization. In addition to the patient's medical history and characteristics of the aneurysm, local vascular stenosis might also contribute to its recurrence. Close postoperative follow-up is required for these patients.

ID ARTERIOVENOUS-FISTULA
AB BACKGROUND: Vertebral-venous fistulas (VVFs) are a rare vascular condition and are commonly associated with trauma but may also be idiopathic, spontaneous, or congenital. A current literature review reveals there is no level 1 evidence or established guidelines on optimal treatment for VVF. Diagnosis is often confirmed by catheter cerebral angiogram. Treatment goals are complete occlusion of the fistula, which can be achieved by both endovascular closure and/or surgical ligation treatment. Telescopic Pipeline flow-diversion stents are a common treatment modality for aneurysms and have also been described to successfully treat different types of cranial arteriovenous fistulas including carotid-cavernous fistulas. There is, however, no English literature available regarding its use in the management of VVFs, which are rare entities.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: The authors present a case of VVF, which is the first reported case to their knowledge whereby a Pipeline flow-diverting stent has been used to successfully treat a VVF while preserving the parent vertebral artery. The authors describe both the advantages and limitations of this approach.
   CONCLUSIONS: This case report highlights the potential of flow-diversion stents in the treatment of VVF. This technique was shown to be a safe and effective method of treatment for VVF. Important limitations, however, need to be considered before this form of treatment for VVF, including the need for multiple devices, extended duration of treatment, and associated increased costs involved.

TI Microscopic Anterior Neural Decompression Combined with Oblique Lumbar
   Interbody Fusion - A Technical Note
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
LA English
DT Article
DE Direct neural decompression; Microscopic decompression; Oblique lumbar
   interbody fusion
ID MANAGEMENT; OUTCOMES
AB BACKGROUND: Minimally invasive oblique lumbar interbody fusion (OLIF) techniques generally rely on deformity correction to achieve indirect neural decompression. However, indirect neural decompression will not always be sufficient. Thus, a second procedure, such as posterior direct decompression, will be added for full decompression, increasing the surgical morbidity and healthcare costs. We have described a technique of direct anterior microscopic neural decompression combined with OLIF.
   METHODS: We report our surgical technique of anterior lumbar neural microscopic decompression with OLIF with patients in the lateral position. We also report the cases of 3 patients treated from March 2018 to June 2018.
   RESULTS: Three patients underwent anterior microscopic neural decompression combined with OLIF in the lateral position. All 3 patients achieved clinically and radiologically significant neural decompression and deformity correction. No perioperative complications developed.
   CONCLUSION: Direct anterior microscopic neural decompression is feasible and safe in selected patients undergoing OLIF.

AB PURPOSE: To evaluate the safety and effectiveness of partial vertebrae resection laterally through intervertebral space to harvest supplemental autograft bone for anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF).
   METHODS: Patients who accepted 1-segment (n = 19, 38.2 months follow-up) or 2-segment (n = 17, 40.4 months follow-up) ACDF with supplemental autograft bone were included. Cervical lordosis (CL), segmental lordosis (SL), anterior segment height (ASH), and posterior segment height (PSH) on neutrally lateral radiography, and intervertebral fusion rate on computed tomography were measured. The operation time, intraoperative blood loss, Japanese Orthopedic Association score, visual analog scale around the neck or arm, Neck Disability Index, and complications were also recorded.
   RESULTS: Mean operation time was 86.2 and 115.6 minutes, and the intraoperative blood loss was 41.7 and 79.4 mL in cases with 1-segment and 2-segment ACDF, respectively. At the final visit, the visual analog scale score and Neck Disability Index significantly decreased, and the Japanese Orthopedic Association score significantly increased. Significant increases were observed in the ASH, PSH, CL, and SL after 2-segment ACDF. Significant increases were observed in the CL and SL after 1-segment ACDF, but not in the ASH and PSH. All the ASH, PSH, CL, and SL kept unchanged at the final visit. All cases acquired definite intervertebral fusion, and the incidence of cage subsidence was 5.3% after 1-segment and 17.6% after 2-segment ACDF at the final visit.
   CONCLUSIONS: Partial vertebrae resection laterally through the intervertebral space was a safe and effective method to harvest supplemental autograft bone for the ACDF.

   PLACEMENT
AB OBJECTIVE: Intracranial arterial dissection (IAD) is a rare cerebrovascular disease that is likely underdiagnosed because of the inherent difficulty of visualizing the subtle radiographic signs of the pathologic small intracranial arteries. No widespread consensus exists on the treatment of IAD, and thus it is often managed empirically because of the absence of major randomized controlled trials. In this study, we conducted a systematic review to evaluate the management and treatment options for IAD.
   METHODS: We performed a systematic review in accordance with the PRISMA guidelines using the following databases: MEDLINE (PubMed) and Cochrane Library. Included studies were limited to human patients with dissections in intracranial vessels only.
   RESULTS: A total of 82 studies were included in this systematic review. The most common complications of IAD were cerebral infarction and subarachnoid hemorrhage, and thus, patients with IAD can be subdivided into those presenting with either ischemia or hemorrhage, respectively. Those with ischemia were predominantly managed with antiplatelet therapy, whereas patients presenting with hemorrhage often were amenable to treatment with endovascular techniques.
   CONCLUSIONS: Given these findings, clinicians should prescribe antiplatelet therapy for patients with IAD presenting with ischemia and consider endovascular treatment for those presenting with hemorrhage. However, further investigation is required given the heterogeneity of methods and reporting outcomes in the investigated studies.

TI Anomalous V3 Segment Aneurysm Associated with Congenital Atlantoaxial
   Dislocation: Case Report and Discussing the Challenges in Management
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
LA English
DT Article
DE Anomalous vertebral artery; Congenital atlantoaxial dislocation;
   Management; Vertebral artery aneurysm
ID VERTEBRAL ARTERY
AB BACKGROUND: An anomalous vertebral artery is not a deterrent for posterior C1-C2 joint manipulation and reduction of atlantoaxial dislocation (AAD). However, presence of an incidental aneurysm in the aberrant segment of artery with concurrent AAD adds to the surgical challenge.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 30-year-old woman presented with neck pain and spastic quadriparesis. Her imaging revealed atlantoaxial dislocation and bony segmentation defects. Three-dimensional computed tomography angiography showed bilateral anomalous vertebral arteries (V3 segment) and an incidental aneurysm on the arterial segment that crossed the right C1-C2 joint posteriorly. Because the artery bearing the aneurysm was nondominant, it was ligated and successful C1-C2 posterior reduction and fusion could be performed.
   CONCLUSION: The association of an incidental aneurysm with an anomalous vertebral artery in congenital AAD is unusual. The etiology could be an underlying collagen defect or repeated shearing trauma to the vessel wall due to C1C2 instability. It would be less risky to proceed with endovascular embolization followed by occipitocervical fusion without opening the joints in case the aneurysm is present on the dominant aberrant V3 segment. Ventral decompression can be supplemented for irreducible AAD. On the contrary, if the aneurysm is present on the nondominant aberrant V3 segment, the C1-2 joint can be opened and manipulated following an initial endovascular treatment of the aneurysm. If the circumstances demand, the nondominant artery can be ligated and sacrificed, although there is a small risk of formation of stump aneurysm.

AB OBJECTIVE: We present our experience with routine intraoperative ultrasound (IOUS)-guided posterior cervical laminectomy (PCL) in patients with degenerative cervical myelopathy (DCM), describe the technique used, and describe relevant IOUS findings that may impact the surgical procedure.
   METHODS: Three illustrative cases are presented of patients (age range, 67-79 years) who underwent PCL with IOUS guidance and instrumented fusion for DCM. Intraoperative standard B-mode images were obtained with a linear array 6.6- to 13.3-MHz transducer.
   RESULTS: Excellent high-resolution IOUS view of the spinal cord and nerve roots was obtained in every case after laminectomy. IOUS had a relevant intraoperative impact in all cases, leading to extended decompression of focal residual compression, confirmation of posterior shift of the spinal cord from anteriorly located structures, and final confirmation of sufficient decompression by visualization of symmetric and rhythmic cord pulsations.
   CONCLUSIONS: IOUS is a poorly described yet easy-to-use and very effective tool for guidance and confirmation of adequate posterior decompression of the cervical spinal cord and nerve roots during PCL. Routinely using IOUS-guided decompression for PCL in patients with myelopathy will help avoid residual compression of neural elements and might be beneficial for functional outcome.

AB BACKGROUND: Symptoms that mimic pituitary apoplexy may be encountered with other neoplastic or infectious lesions.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: This 38-year-old man presented with severe sudden-onset headache and relapsing and remitting vision loss. Radiographic imaging studies demonstrated radiographic features of a hyperdense, hemorrhagic mass in the sellar region. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a 4-cm mass abutting the optic chiasm and compressing the pituitary. After 4-week follow-up, surveillance MRI demonstrated near-complete resolution of the previously identified planum sphenoidale and suprasellar mass. The patient re-presented 13 months later with recurrent symptoms. MRI demonstrated recurrence of the mass. Given the broad differential diagnosis, an endoscopic endonasal biopsy was obtained; the findings were suggestive of a high-grade meningioma. The patient underwent elective resection of the extraaxial lesion via a frontotemporal approach. The lesion was identified as a hemorrhagic suprasellar atypical planum sphenoidale meningioma. Postoperatively, the patient's headaches improved significantly and his right-sided visual changes resolved. After adjuvant radiotherapy (5400 cGy in 30 fractions) to the surgical cavity 3 months later, at last follow-up 5 months postoperatively, the patient was at his neurologic baseline and denied any headaches or visual sequelae.
   CONCLUSIONS: As the most common benign intracranial tumors, meningiomas should remain in the differential for patients presenting with apoplectiform symptoms.

   VISUAL OUTCOMES; EXPERIENCE; COMPLICATIONS; VISION
AB BACKGROUND: Recent reports have described that endovascular treatment of coil embolization of opththalmic artery (OphA) aneurysms has a relative risk of visual disruption caused by thromboembolic infarction of the central retinal artery (CRA), especially the OphA when it originates within the body of the aneurysm. Patent microthrombus in the OphA might also cause retinal infarction that affects visual acuity. We describe stent-assisted coil embolization of an OphA aneurysm complicated with a severe visual disturbance, although normal flow was scrupulously maintained in the OphA during the procedure. The visual disturbance was recovered by early treatment.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 40-year-old woman who presented with an intracranial aneurysm arising from the right OphA underwent stent-assisted coil embolization under general anesthesia. Although the area around the origin of the OphA was intentionally avoided and anterograde flow in the OphA was monitored by repeated angiography during this procedure, sight in the right eye was lost immediately thereafter. The immediate application of ocular massage and intraarterial fibrinolysis improved vision in the right eye to essentially normal status after discharge.
   CONCLUSIONS: Despite good anterograde flow in the OphA during aneurysm embolization, the procedural risk of a visual disturbance due to thromboembolic complications of CRA occlusion cannot be avoided. Anterograde flow in the OphA and retinochoroidal blush should be monitored by repeated angiography during coil embolization to prevent vision loss. Should vision be lost, a rapid response including ocular massage and intraarterial fibrinolysis is required for recovery.

   treatment; Vertebral artery dissection
ID SPECTRUM
AB BACKGROUND: Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS) is a rare genetic connective tissue disorders, but the vascular type (type IV) typically poses the greatest risk to patients. We report a case of multiple cranial artery dissection, which was successfully treated with carotid artery stenting.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 50-year-old woman presented with recurrent severe headaches caused by bilateral vertebral artery dissections that were treated conservatively at our hospital. However, she developed right cervical pain and dizziness at 3 days after admission, and a magnetic resonance angiogram revealed dissection of the right internal carotid artery. Because the dissected portion of the artery had narrowed, a stent was placed. The pearl and string formations in the bilateral vertebral arteries then improved spontaneously. Subsequently, the patient was diagnosed with EDS type IV via a skin biopsy, and review of her family history revealed that multiple family members had suffered from subarachnoid hemorrhages. No neurologic deficits were observed, and the patient was discharged without further events at 30 days after admission.
   CONCLUSIONS: It is extremely rare for multiple artery dissections to occur at the same time. EDS type IV should be considered as an important differential diagnosis in similar cases, even in adult patients without a known history of connective tissue disease or vascular complications.

TI Meckel Cave Epidermoid Cyst Presenting as Multiple Cranial Nerve
   Deficits Due to Indirect Tumoral Compression of the Cavernous Sinus: A
   Case Report and Literature Review
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY

DT Review
DE Cavernous sinus; Cholesteatoma; Epidermoid cyst; Meckel cave; Skull
   base; Trigeminal neuralgia
ID TRIGEMINAL NEURALGIA; OCULOMOTOR NERVE; PTOSIS; PALSY; CT
AB BACKGROUND: Epidermoid cysts in Meckel cave are exceedingly rare. Since 1971, only 17 cases have been reported in the literature, with most patients presenting with trigeminal hypesthesia. However, outgrowth of these lesions from Meckel cave can rarely lead to compression of the proximate cavernous sinus and the neurovascular structures contained within. To date, 2 cases have reported a Meckel cave epidermoid cyst presenting clinically as an intracavernous cranial nerve palsy, presumably a clinical manifestation of cavernous sinus compression from the lesion.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: We describe a case involving a 51-year-old woman presenting with unilateral refractory trigeminal neuralgia, facial hypesthesia, abducens palsy, plus new-onset partial ptosis. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed a mass in the left Meckel cave that was T1 hypointense, T2 hyperintense, peripherally enhancing, and restricting diffusion. A stereotactic left subtemporal extradural approach was used to resect the lesion, which alleviated most of the patient's symptomatology except for minimal intermittent left-sided facial hypesthesia that remained at her 1-year postoperative visit.
   CONCLUSIONS: This is a unique report depicting an epidermoid cyst in the Meckel cave causing numerous cranial nerve deficits because of indirect tumoral compression of cranial nerves within the cavernous sinus.

TI "Swirl Sign" in Extradural Hematoma
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
LA English
DT Article
DE Extradural hematoma; Head trauma; Swirl sign
AB "Swirl sign" is a relatively uncommon sign, seen on noncontrast CT scan in patients of head trauma who develop extradural hematoma. It has 2 components: hyperacute, which represents ongoing active intracranial bleed, and acute, which comprises surrounding hyperattenuated clotted blood. The importance of early identification of this sign by surgeons and aggressive surgical management might have a bearing on the prognosis and survival of the patients, as emphasized here by 2 clinical scenarios. The clinical implication is that identification of the swirl sign suggests expanding extradural hematoma with ongoing active bleed, warranting aggressive surgical management.

DT Article
DE CN VI palsy; PICA aneurysm; Subarachnoid hemorrhage
ID SIGN
AB BACKGROUND: Isolated abducens nerve palsy can be the presenting sign of a ruptured PICA aneurysm. Few cases have been reported in the literature. In the majority of cases, cranial nerve VI resolved following microsurgical clipping.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: Here, we report a 56-year-old female who presented with a ruptured 4 mm 3 3 mm left PICA aneurysm associated with a left abducens nerve palsy. The patient underwent endovascular coil embolization of the aneurysm and had complete resolution of her abducens nerve palsy.
   CONCLUSIONS: Here, we present the first case of an abducens nerve palsy associated with a ruptured PICA aneurysm to completely resolve following endovascular coil embolization. The direction and amount of subarachnoid hemorrhage extravasation from the ruptured aneurysm are most likely responsible for cranial nerve palsy.

   DEPOSITION; CRANIOCERVICAL JUNCTION; DISC HERNIA; MASS; DISAPPEARANCE
AB BACKGROUND: Retro-odontoid pseudotumor (RP) can be caused by several diseases, especially rheumatoid arthritis, and is usually associated with the presence of atlantoaxial instability. On the other hand, a different group of patients have been identified in whom RP is observed without radiologic findings of atlantoaxial instability. The pathophysiology, clinical characteristics, and prognosis of this latter group of patients are not well described in the literature.
   METHODS: A PubMed and Scopus search adhering to PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines was performed to include studies reporting patients with RP without radiologic instability (RPWRI). The data gathered from this review were analyzed to characterize RPWRI.
   RESULTS: The search yielded 36 articles with a total of 62 patients. All studies were case reports and small case series. Different characteristics of RPWRI are described, including causes, pathophysiology, and treatment.
   CONCLUSIONS: The results of this review show that RPWRI has different causes such as hypermobility, deposition of substances, and perhaps disc herniation. Depending on the cause of RPWRI, the pathophysiologic mechanism is different. Treatment should be tailored based on the primary cause of RP and the degree of compression of the cervicomedullary junction. Different degrees of improvement are usually observed after surgical treatment in these patients regardless of the treatment used, but a higher rate of mass regression was observed in those patients in whom the atlantoaxial joint was stabilized.

ID MUTANT PREVENTION CONCENTRATION; CEREBROSPINAL-FLUID; BIOFILM FORMATION;
   MENINGITIS; MANAGEMENT; METHANESULFONATE; SERUM
AB BACKGROUND: Acinetobacter baumannii meningitis and ventriculitis are difficult issues, because of the low diffusion of antibiotics in the cerebrospinal fluid and bacterial multidrug resistance. The presence of an infected intraventricular hematoma, constituting an equivalent of undrained abscess, may promote biofilm formation and failure of medical treatment.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: In this case of ventriculostomy-related infection after ventricular hemorrhage, Acinetobacter baumannii was sensitive only to colistin and tigecycline. Despite a combination therapy involving intraventricular injections of colistin, we observed clinical and bacteriologic failure. Therefore, at day 4 of antibiotic therapy, we performed intraventricular fibrinolysis, which dissolved the clot, enabling sterilization of the cerebrospinal fluid after 48 hours.
   CONCLUSION: This clinical case suggests the usefulness of intraventricular fibrinolysis to lyse the clot and optimize the action of antibiotics.

DE Cerebral aneurysm; Coccidioidal meningitis; Coccidioidomycosis; Mycotic
   aneurysm; Subarachnoid hemorrhage
ID VASCULITIS
AB BACKGROUND: Coccidioidal meningitis can progress to vasculitis with aneurysm formation. Although aneurysmogenesis is rare, it carries exceptionally high mortality. Except in one instance, prior case reports have documented universally fatal consequences.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 26-year-old man developed disseminated coccidioidomycosis with formation of multiple aneurysms throughout the anterior intracranial vasculature bilaterally. This report is unique in that it chronicles the formation and subsequent spontaneous thrombosis of several aneurysms over a 4-week period. In total 10 aneurysms were documented in the same patient-the highest reported to date. The patient was eventually discharged from the hospital for what has heretofore been a universally fatal disease process. Neurologic examination and vascular imaging 1 month after discharge demonstrated stable findings.
   CONCLUSIONS: Coccidioidal aneurysms carry a high mortality. The mainstay of therapy remains lifelong triazole antifungal therapy with the addition of liposomal amphotericin in cases of treatment failure. Steroid use is controversial but should be considered whenever there is vascular involvement. Although watchful waiting is reasonable in light of the possibility of spontaneous thrombosis with medical management, dynamic changes in aneurysm size or configuration should prompt timely endovascular or operative interventions.

ID MANAGEMENT; DIAGNOSIS
AB BACKGROUND: Necrotizing fasciitis (NF) is a surgical diagnosis characterized by a rapidly progressive soft tissue infection, widespread tissue necrosis, and associated systemic illness. Friability of the superficial fascia, dishwatergray exudate, and absence of pus are surgical characteristics of this diagnosis. Due to rapid progression of the infection, early recognition and aggressive surgical debridement are crucial to reduce mortality. Despite being commonly seen by general, plastic, and orthopedic surgeons, NF is an extremely rare spine surgery emergency. Our objective is to report on a case of NF involving the spine and highlight this unusual surgical emergency for the spine surgeon.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: We present a rare case of a 61-year-old woman who presented to the emergency department in septic shock. She had a 1-week history of increasing back pain before presenting to us. Computed tomography revealed extensive soft tissue emphysema with involvement of the L3 vertebral body and spina canal. She underwent emergency surgical debridement. Despite maximal medical and surgical therapies, the patient died secondary to multisystem organ failure within 36 hours of initial presentation.
   CONCLUSIONS: To the best of our knowledge, the literature presents only 1 previous case reported involving the spine. Necrotizing fasciitis is an unusual surgical spine surgery emergency. Spine surgeons should be aware of this diagnosis in order to provide timely aggressive surgical debridement.

AB BACKGROUND: Hydrocephalus is an international disease process that is commonly treated surgically with a ventriculoperitoneal shunt. This device may be prone to malfunction, most commonly from obstruction, disconnection, or infection.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 35-year-old female with hydrocephalus and a ventriculoperitoneal shunt presented with altered mental status and imaging concerning for a shunt malfunction. Intraoperatively, she was found to have bone growing over and compressing the proximal occluder of the shunt valve, causing a mechanical obstruction. Removal of the bone allowed for egress of cerebrospinal fluid and return of proper shunt function. The patient did well postoperatively.
   CONCLUSION: Hydrocephalus, ventriculoperitoneal shunts, and shunt revisions represent a significant health burden and cost. Here we present an unusual cause of a shunt malfunction caused by bony overgrowth.

AB OBJECTIVE: Flow diversion has been an important addition to endovascular neurosurgery, but its use in the posterior circulation remains controversial. Our goal is to describe the safety and efficacy of moderate sedation during flow diversion for posterior circulation lesions (aneurysms or dissecting pseudoaneurysms).
   METHODS: The authors retrospectively reviewed the medical records of all patients who underwent placement of a Pipeline embolization device for a posterior circulation lesion using moderate sedation at a single institution from August 2012 through November 2017. Clinical data and outcomes were evaluated.
   RESULTS: Fifteen consecutive patients were identified: 8 female, 7 male (mean age 52.2 +/- 16.3 years, range 15-81). Eleven lesions were located in the vertebral artery, 1 in the posterior inferior cerebellar artery, 2 in the posterior cerebral artery, and 1 in the basilar artery. All patients underwent flow diversion with Pipeline embolization devices. One patient experienced an acute occlusion of the basilar artery during the procedure that required revascularization. Mean fluoroscopy time was 35.6 +/- 16.5 minutes (range 15.5-75). Mean follow-up time was 12.7 +/- 8.8 months (range 3-36). No patient had new neurologic deficits in the perioperative or postoperative period. Conversion to general anesthesia was not required in any case.
   CONCLUSIONS: Moderate sedation is safe and feasible in patients undergoing flow diversion for posterior circulation lesions. In addition, its use may allow for more rapid identification of procedural complications, facilitating emergent treatment and decreasing procedure-related morbidity.

AB OBJECTIVE: The management of chronic complete internal carotid artery (ICA) occlusion (COICA) has been challenging. Endovascular procedures have been performed with variable success and risks, depending on the type of occlusion and distal revascularization. We present a novel hybrid procedure to recanalize the ICA when previous endovascular interventions have failed or been deemed too risky.
   METHODS: Two patients presented with symptomatic COICA after maximal medical management. They were deemed at high risk of endovascular intervention and/or previous endovascular attempts had failed. Thus, they had indications for a hybrid procedure.
   RESULTS: A hybrid technique was used to create a stump by surgical endarterectomy, followed by recanalization using an endovascular approach via femoral access. We have described the technique in detail. Postoperative computed tomography perfusion scanning showed normalization of the mean transient time, cerebral blood volume, and cerebral blood flow compared with the preoperative findings. Cerebral angiography showed successful recanalization of the ICA. Neither patient experienced any complications.
   CONCLUSION: A hybrid technique is feasible and should be considered for patients with COICA in whom maximal medical management has failed and who have a high-risk profile for endovascular intervention or in whom previous endovascular attempts have failed.

ID ENDOSCOPIC TRANSSPHENOIDAL CHIASMAPEXY; DETERIORATION
AB BACKGROUND: Visual field deterioration caused by secondary empty sella after cabergoline therapy for prolactinoma is a rare event. Chiasmapexy is performed to treat empty sella syndrome. Although various materials have been used for the elevation of the optic chasm, the most appropriate material remains to be established. Here, we describe the efficiency of chiasmapexy for empty sella syndrome following dopamine agonist treatment and the utility of septal cartilage and sphenoidal sinus bone as materials for chiasmapexy.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 35-year-old male with a history of cabergoline therapy for prolactinoma presented with visual deterioration. His magnetic resonance imaging revealed optic chiasm herniation into the empty sella. Endoscopic endonasal transsphenoidal chiasmapexy was performed using septal cartilage and sphenoidal sinus bone as materials for elevating the chiasm. Visual function improved immediately after operation.
   CONCLUSIONS: Chiasmapexy is an effective surgical method for treating visual deterioration caused by empty sella after cabergoline treatment. Endoscopic endonasal chiasmapexy with septal cartilage and sphenoidal sinus bone is a considerable option because it is minimally invasive and involves decreased risk of infection.

AB BACKGROUND: Visual misperceptions as a result of neurosurgical disorders are well documented. Alice in Wonderland syndrome (AWS) typically is reported in neurologic and psychiatric disorders. We present a patient who developed symptoms of AWS postoperatively.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 48-year-old man presented in shunt failure, attributed to a proximal catheter occlusion. Operative revision with replacement of the proximal catheter was performed without incident. Postoperatively, he complained of visual disturbances, including the perception that people had small heads on full-sized bodies. Symptoms resolved postoperatively. The patient's symptoms were diagnosed as a transient episode of AWS. This was attributed to manipulation of the parieto-occipital cortex during the revision. The local inflammatory response from manipulation of that area is thought to have caused our patient's symptoms.
   CONCLUSIONS: Visual disturbances caused by lesions along the optic radiations are common findings for neurosurgery patients, although AWS after surgical intervention has not been reported previously.

   DIAGNOSIS
AB BACKGROUND: Aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage secondary to ruptured small dissecting fusiform aneurysms of the posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA) is rare and particularly challenging. Different treatment strategies have been reported in these rare cases. We report 2 patients treated with a novel endovascular approach.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: Two patients presented with subarachnoid hemorrhage secondary to very small (3 mm and 4 mm) ruptured fusiform aneurysms of the proximal section of the PICA trunk. Both patients were treated by coil embolization combined with parent artery preservation by microcatheter autoassistance. Both coiling procedures were uneventful, and the patients remained asymptomatic. Long-term follow-up angiography in both patients showed complete occlusion of aneurysms with patency of PICA.
   CONCLUSIONS: There is no single treatment strategy suitable for all PICA aneurysms. Our proposed method may be best applied to small dissecting fusiform aneurysms located on a small (<= 1 mm in diameter) PICA distally to its origin.

ID INTRADURAL LIPOMAS; CORD; DIAGNOSIS; TUMORS
AB BACKGROUND: Intradural intramedullary lipomas without dysraphism are rare tumors. Although they appear extramedullary on imaging, they invade into the intramedullary substance of the spinal cord. We present 2 cases and discuss their clinical presentation, radiologic findings, and surgical management.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: Case 1 is a 21-year-old woman who presented with upper back pain from recurrent lipoma. She had undergone partial excision in 2008 at an outside hospital. Physical examination revealed full strength but hyperreflexia in the legs. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a recurrent thoracic spinal tumor with spinal cord compression. Surgery was performed, and it was found that the tumor was both extramedullary and intramedullary, with an obscure delineation between tumor and cord. Subtotal excision was performed, and the patient remained neurologically intact. Case 2 is a 47-year-old woman who presented with leg weakness, difficulty in walking, and foot drop. Physical examination revealed 4/5 in the lower extremities. MRI demonstrated a spinal lipoma with thoracic cord compression. Even though the tumor appeared to be an extramedullary lesion by MRI, intraoperatively, the tumor became intramedullary with loss of distinction between the spinal cord and tumor. Subtotal excision was performed, and the patient regained her strength to 5/5 postoperatively.
   CONCLUSIONS: Intramedullary thoracic spinal lipomas without spinal dysraphism are rare. Although these tumors may appear completely extramedullary on imaging, extreme care should be taken during surgery because the lesions eventually become intramedullary, intercalating within the substance of the spinal cord, precluding gross total resection.

AB BACKGROUND: Despite the mixed evidence regarding the effect of decompressive craniectomy in terms of outcome, a tremendous increase in related reports has been observed in the last years. Cranioplasty plays a key role in restoring function and anatomy of the cranial vault. Considering that cranioplasty is not exempt from risks, the identification of the safest technique becomes crucial to achieve better patients' recovery. Porous hydroxyapatite (PHA) has received growing attention for its potential in bony integration. Here we report a multicenter prospective follow-up analysis of 149 patients who underwent cranioplasty with PHA prostheses. In particular, we focus on the incidence of adverse events and implant removal.
   METHOD: From January 2001 to December 2015 we conducted a prospective multicenter study of 149 patients who underwent cranioplasty with custom-made PHA flaps after decompressive craniectomy for several reasons. The endpoints were the incidence of adverse events after cranioplasty and of related implant removal.
   RESULTS: 66 patients (44%) were treated within 6 months from decompression, and only 2 patients had a bifrontal bilateral reconstruction. Of those, 25 patients reported complications (16.8%), and 9 of them (6% of the whole case series) required removal of the prosthesis. The only significant factor predicting cranioplasty removal was a previous infection.
   CONCLUSION: Hydroxyapatite for cranial implants is fully comparable to other heterologous materials. It has a biologic potential of bony integration. The risk of explants seems to be significantly higher in second-line patients, data not shown in previous studies.

DE Craniotomy; Footdrop; Neurologic examination; Subdural hematoma; Surgery
AB BACKGROUND: Patients with chronic subdural hematoma (CSDH) typically present with symptoms of increased intracranial pressure, including headache, nausea/ vomiting, and somnolence, or with contralateral weakness. Compression of the convexity cerebral cortex usually causes motor deficit that is more readily appreciated in the upper extremity rather than in the leg, and very subtle deficit may be detected only by looking for pronator drift. The precise pattern of signs and symptoms in CSDH may vary from case to case depending on the specific anatomy of compression, but isolated lower extremity weakness is rare.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 79-year-old woman presented with isolated footdrop. CSDH overlying the cerebral convexity was detected on computed tomography. The foot weakness resolved on surgical drainage.
   CONCLUSIONS: CSDH overlying the cerebral convexity may manifest with isolated foot weakness. Awareness of the potential for this unusual presentation of CSDH may be useful to the clinician assessing a patient with otherwise unexplained foot weakness.

AB BACKGROUND: The endoscopic endonasal approach is widely used for treating giant pituitary adenomas. However, a small subset of tumors is still challenging to treat, and the risk of complications increases when an endoscopic endonasal approach alone is used. The simultaneous combined endoscopic endonasal and transcranial approach is a surgical option for such difficult adenomas; however, very few studies have described the technical nuances and benefits of this approach.
   METHODS: We treated 3 patients with giant pituitary adenoma and 1 patient with pituicytoma. Radiologic findings and clinical outcomes were retrospectively reviewed.
   RESULTS: All patients had preoperative visual disturbances. A pterional approach was combined with an endoscopic endonasal approach to treat all the patients. Near-total and subtotal tumor removal was accomplished in 3 patients; however, only partial tumor removal was possible in 1 patient. Postoperative visual function improved in 3 patients, but there were no changes in 1 patient. There were no major complications; however, each patient developed either adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and thyroid-stimulating hormone deficiency or ACTH deficiency and persistent diabetes. Importantly, no cerebrospinal fluid leakage was observed in the patients.
   CONCLUSIONS: Our simultaneous combined endoscopic and transcranial approach offers safe tumor resection and a low rate of complications. In this procedure, it is important that tumor debulking be performed by the main surgeon via a single surgical route and not by 2 surgeons using the simultaneous endonasal and transcranial approach, to avoid interference in the surgical field. This approach may be considered as a surgical option for carefully selected tumors in the sellar region.

AB BACKGROUND: Few studies have been published about percutaneous techniques for management of surgical bed hemorrhage during a stereotactic biopsy, a serious complication that may affect patient outcome. We describe the injection of a thrombin-gelatin matrix through the biopsy cannula as an effective method to arrest surgical bed bleeding that does not respond to conventional methods of hemostasis.
   METHODS: We prospectively documented image-guided stereotactic brain biopsy procedures in 30 awake patients between July 2014 and July 2017 at our center. Among patients presenting with intractable surgical bed bleeding, a thrombin-gelatin matrix injection through the biopsy cannula was performed. Details of the injection technique, surgical outcome, and complications were recorded.
   RESULTS: Among 30 documented stereotactic brain biopsies, 3 (10%) had intractable surgical bed bleeding during the procedure. In all 3 cases, thrombin-gelatin matrix was injected, and an immediate arrest of hemorrhage was achieved. None of the patients required a craniotomy or further invasive measure to achieve hemostasis. No postoperative complications were recorded.
   CONCLUSIONS: Our preliminary results suggest that thrombin-gelatin matrix injection is a simple, safe, and effective stereotactic practice to manage persistent surgical bed bleeding that cannot be arrested by standard, conventional hemostatic methods.

AB Surgery for depressed skull fractures has developed over centuries to attain the consensus approaches currently used. This review outlines the last 200 years of development of surgical approaches to closed and open depressed skull fractures, fractures involving dural venous sinuses and ping-pong fractures involving infants. Early reports often dealt with only closed and open depressed skull fractures. However, experience has shown that each fracture category merits its own management strategies. Accepted approaches are based on observation only; there is little to no scientific evidence to support treatment for any fracture type.

   A Case Report
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
LA English
DT Article
DE Campotomy; Pallidothalamic tract; Parkinson disease
ID THALAMOTOMY
AB BACKGROUND: The pallidothalamic tract connects the globus pallidus internus and the ventrolateral portion of the thalamus, and ablation of the pallidothalamic tract (pallidothalamic tractotomy [PTT]) reportedly exerts antiparkinsonian effects. However, the detailed clinical course has not yet been elucidated. Here, we present the first single case report of PTT performed in a patient with Parkinson disease, with 1-year follow-up.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: The patient was a 68-year-old woman with Parkinson disease. After 14 years of receiving oral medication, she experienced the "wearing-off" phenomenon. Levodopa (300 mg/day) was required to maintain daily activities. Rigidity and peak-dose dyskinesia were predominantly observed in the right side of her body. In addition, she demonstrated right foot dystonia with pain. The preoperative Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale part 1, 2 (off medication/on medication), 3 (off medication/on medication), and 4 scores were 7, 26/4, 41/23, and 13, respectively. Further, the preoperative Unified Dyskinesia Rating Scale and Parkinson Disease Questionnaire-39 scores were 102 and 46, respectively. She underwent left-sided PTT, and no perioperative complications were observed. At 1 year postoperatively, daily administration of levodopa (200 mg) was maintained without an "off" condition all day. The 1-year Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale part 1, 2, 3, and 4 scores were 5, 9/1, 20/12, and 5, respectively. In addition, the 1-year Unified Dyskinesia Rating Scale and Parkinson Disease Questionnaire-39 scores were 20 and 20, respectively.
   CONCLUSIONS: We present a rare case of PTT performed in a patient with Parkinson disease. PTT might be useful in patients who do not desire device implantation.

LA English
DT Article
DE Anterior cingulotomy; Depression; Neuropathic pain
ID DEEP BRAIN-STIMULATION; INTRATHECAL DRUG-DELIVERY; CINGULATE;
   MODULATION; MANAGEMENT; EFFICACY
AB BACKGROUND: The presence of neuropathic pain can severely impinge on emotional regulation and activities of daily living including social activities, resulting in diminished life satisfaction. Unfortunately, the majority of patients with neuropathic pain do not experience an amelioration of symptoms from conventional therapies, even when multimodal therapies are used. Chronic refractory neuropathic pain is usually accompanied by severe depression that is prone to incur suicidal events; thus clinical management of chronic neuropathic pain and depression presents a serious challenge for clinicians and patients.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: Two patients presented at our institution with neuropathic pain and severe depression. The patients had different pain symptoms emerging a few months after central or peripheral nervous system impairment. These symptoms were associated with the development of severe depression, social isolation, and a gradual inability to perform daily activities. Both patients were referred to our treatment center for bilateral anterior cingulotomy. After surgery, both patients showed significant progressive improvements in perceived pain, mental health status, and daily functioning.
   CONCLUSIONS: Bilateral anterior cingulotomy may serve as an alternative treatment for medically refractory neuropathic pain, especially for patients who also experience depression.

DT Article
DE CO2 insufflation; Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography; ERCP;
   Laparoscopy; Pituitary apoplexy
ID PREVALENCE; MANAGEMENT
AB BACKGROUND: Pituitary apoplexy is an uncommon neurosurgical emergency that may be the initial presentation of undiagnosed pituitary adenomas. Though the exact pathogenesis is unclear, there appears to be an association between pituitary apoplexy and medical interventions that disturb the blood supply and venous drainage of the abnormal sellar region. We present the first case of pituitary apoplexy occurring after an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP).
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 43-year-old male who was several hours status post ERCP presented with a severe headache, bilateral ptosis, and multidirectional ophthalmoplegia. Computed tomography scan and magnetic resonance imaging of the brain revealed a hemorrhagic and necrotic sellar mass with suprasellar extension compressing the optic chiasm and bilateral extension displacing the cavernous carotid arteries laterally. The patient underwent emergent endoscopic endonasal transsphenoidal resection of the underlying pituitary tumor apoplexy with eventual resolution of his cranial nerve palsies.
   CONCLUSIONS: Although pituitary apoplexy has been recognized as a sequela of surgical and laparoscopic procedures, it should also be considered in less invasive gastrointestinal procedures which may alter the intraabdominal pressures, such as ERCP. Early detection of this unusual complication allows for rapid diagnosis and timely surgical intervention in select cases to prevent debilitating cranial nerve palsies, preserve visual function, and retain normal pituitary function.

   stimulation mapping
ID LOW-GRADE GLIOMA; RESECTION; MULTIPLICATION; EXTENT
AB BACKGROUND: To avoid permanent neurologic deficits and preserve brain function in and near the eloquent area, intraoperative electrical stimulation mapping (IESM) is necessary. However, little is known about how these subcortical regions are involved in calculation processing function in patients with glioma.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: We report the case of a 56-year-old, right-handed woman working at a primary school as a teacher who had recurrent left parietal glioma. She underwent initial surgical resection for a low-grade glioma present in the left parietal lobe 14 months before recurrence. The latest magnetic resonance imaging results revealed an enhancing lesion in the cavity of the initial resection with an infiltrating tumor in the parietal lobe. Preserving language function and calculation processing was critical; therefore, she underwent awake surgery using IESM. Thus, the calculation site was elicited by subcortical electrical stimulation at the bottom of the tumor cavity during second resection. At the same point, she could speak normally but could not calculate repeatedly when stimulated. Therefore, we stopped tumor resection. After diagnosing anaplastic astrocytoma, she underwent radiation therapy and chemotherapy. She resumed her normal life as a teacher with preserved language and calculation processing. Eventually, 31 months later, she died from disease progression.
   CONCLUSIONS: In this report, IESM performed during awake surgery in a subcortical site demonstrated a crucial role played by the dominant parietal lobe in calculation.

AB BACKGROUND: Different diseases may occur within the same anatomic space and invade one another. Lesions of this nature are described as collision tumors. Collision tumors of the sella are rare, with pituitary adenomacraniopharyngiomas having been described in only 15 cases. We discuss common and rare lesions of the sellar region, their neurodiagnostic qualities, and treatment considerations.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: We present the case of a 49-year-old woman presenting with symptoms of headache and blurred vision who underwent a 2-stage procedure and was found to have a craniopharyngioma and corticotrophic pituitary adenoma in collision. We review the literature on various combinations of sellar collision lesions, noting diagnostic and treatment considerations. Neuroimaging, intraoperative pathology, and histologic review help to provide optimum treatment when unusual conditions of the sella arise.
   CONCLUSIONS: Many mechanisms for the development of collision lesions have been theorized, and further investigation may provide definitive answers regarding the origin of these neoplastic entities.

   Trigeminal neuralgia
ID MICROVASCULAR DECOMPRESSION; COMPRESSION; PROGRAM; NERVE; BOY; 2ND
AB BACKGROUND: Trigeminal neuralgia (TN) is a well-recognized facial pain syndrome. Discrete forms with disparate pain symptoms include classic and atypical. However, atypical facial pain includes neuralgiform pain along a spectrum. Most cases of TN are diagnosed in the adult population. Case reports and series of children have presented TN as a similar entity, with treatment similar to that for adults. We reviewed the pertinent data and present 2 pediatric TN cases successfully treated with microvascular decompression (MVD).
   CASE DESCRIPTION: Two pediatric patients (age 12 and 15 years) with TN refractory to previous medical therapy were identified. Both patients were deemed appropriate surgical candidates and underwent MVD to manage their TN. TN compression was arterial in both cases and involved portions of the anterior inferior cerebellar artery. Patient 1 was pain free 6 months after the procedure. Patient 2 was pain free immediately after the procedure and had been weaned off preoperative symptomatic management at the latest follow-up visit. The most recent follow-up examination was 12 and 8 months for patients 1 and 2, respectively, with both experiencing continued freedom from pain.
   CONCLUSIONS: Few studies have reported on the effectiveness of MVD in the pediatric population for the management of TN. The supporting data and our 2 cases have demonstrated that MVD is effective for pediatric patients to treat their TN. Furthermore, the side effects appear to be minimal, with excellent pain relief after MVD in this patient population.

   Stationary Binder Clips in Scalp Hemostasis
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
LA English
DT Article
DE Clips; Cost; Hemostasis; History; Raney; Scalp
AB OBJECTIVE: The primary training in any surgical practice starts with tissue handling and effective hemostasis. Neurosurgical procedures start with an incision in the scalp and require summative use of mechanical hemostats and bipolar coagulation to achieve hemostasis. Though Raney clips are the most popular and effective in maintaining hemostasis, their high cost and nonreusability become deterrents for routine use in resource-stricken environments. -
   METHODS: We have compared stationery binder clips of different sizes with Raney clips on the parameters of effectiveness, availability, and cost. Binder clips were also used in intraoperative settings for scalp hemostasis. The comparative efficacy, additional usage of cautery, and need for sterilization are also discussed.
   RESULTS: We describe our experience with simple stationery metal binder clips in maintaining effective hemostasis in a cost-effective manner. The 25-mm size binder clip exerts same force as a Raney clip without any tissue injury. Practical application revealed effective scalp hemostasis up to blood pressure of 150 mm Hg.
   CONCLUSIONS: Stationery binder clips are a cost-effective, ready-to-use alternative for standard Raney clips.

AB BACKGROUND: We describe the case of a 62-year-old woman who was admitted to our center for acute diplopia secondary to a left III cranial nerve palsy, left eyelid swelling and ptosis, and mild ipsilateral retroorbital pain. No other motor or sensitive deficits were observed.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: Computed tomography angiography and digital subtraction angiography were performed, showing a 25-mm left intracavernous aneurysm with a central intrasaccular thrombus, an intrasaccular "swirling" flow with a donut-shape appearance. A flow-diverter stent was deployed bridging the aneurysmal neck.
   CONCLUSIONS: Twelve months after the procedure the aneurysm was completely occluded, and the patient had totally recovered the cavernous syndrome. A careful literature review has been performed, and the different endovascular approaches have been analyzed.

   INJURY; STAB WOUNDS; BRAIN; BODY; ABSCESS
AB BACKGROUND: Craniocerebral injuries due to the induction of sharp objects are relatively rare and are nearly always observed in the pediatric rather than the adult population. Orbitocranial injuries involving a piece of smooth steel rod are extremely rare and to our knowledge have yet to be reported in previous publications. When this particular category of injury does occur, the invading intracranial foreign body usually remains lodged within its entry position. This is most often near the entry point and within the frontal lobe after penetrating the orbit. Migration of the penetrating object far from the initial entry point is quite rare and has been historically confined to low-velocity bullet wounds.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: An adult man was injured on the right eyelid by a section of steel rod. The rod had entered the cranium through the right orbital roof and was lodged within the corresponding right frontal lobe. An initial plain radiograph showed that the rod was within the right frontal lobe. However, computed tomographic angiography of the brain performed during the second day of admission demonstrated displacement of the rod to the left hemisphere. This finding was clearly demonstrated through subsequent imaging. As a result of the migration, the rod could be distracted fairly easily through a left parasagittal and interhemispheric approach. Postoperatively, the patient made a full recovery.
   CONCLUSIONS: Migration of traumatically introduced intracranial foreign bodies far from their initial entry places should be suspected in objects possessing sufficient weight and a smooth surface. This means that a correct assessment of the final position of such objects is necessary before surgery, even while the patient is on the operating table.

ID SPINAL-CORD TUMORS; FEATURES; SERIES
AB BACKGROUND: Spinal cord ependymomas are the most frequent primary intramedullary tumors of the cord in middle age (40-60 years of age). Myxopapillary ependymomas are low-incidence tumors and occur in the cauda equina and conus medullaris. They are typically described as fleshy, sausage-shaped, vascular lesions.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: In this report, we present a 36-year-old woman who was seen in another hospital with complaints of back pain radiating into both legs 5 years ago. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examinations revealed a lesion releated to the spinal cord. At that point, the patient refused the proposed surgical treatment. Five years later, the patient was referred to our clinic with advancement of the complaint to paraparesis. The new MRI showed an intradural mass at the level of T11 and S1. We performed a total intradural tumor resection. Histopathologic examination revealed a myxopapillary ependymoma.
   CONCLUSIONS: Myxopapillary ependymomas grow slowly and are well defined by MRI. Advancements in radiologic technology and surgical equipment have allowed this tumor type to be treated successfully. Unfortunately, if untreated, these lesions have poor prognosis and result in clinical symptoms such as paraparesis. Surgical treatment of these lesions using total resection was performed total resection and was associated with an excellent postoperative outcome. We highlight the natural course of myxopapillary ependymomas.

ID MALFORMATION; EMBOLIZATION
AB BACKGROUND: Trigeminal neuralgia (TN) caused by a tentorial dural arteriovenous fistula (TDAVF) is quite rare. To date, only 10 cases and 2 small case series have been reported in this regard, and most were treated with either embolization or surgery. Here, we report a unique case of a TDAVF presented as TN, which was embolized with Onyx first and resected later.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 57-year-old male presented with right-sided TN. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed a variceal venous dilation occupying the right lateral pontine cistern and multiple venous flow void signals adjacent to the right trigeminal nerve root entry zone. Digital subtraction angiography revealed the right TDAVF, which was completely embolized with transarterial Onyx later. The patient remained symptom free for 1 year before TN recurred. Digital subtraction angiography did not exhibit the recurrence of fistula. After resection of embolized dilated veins, the symptom alleviated and the patient remained symptom free for the 5-month follow-up to date.
   CONCLUSIONS: Even complete obliteration of fistula could cause the recurrence of neuralgia, and resection of embolized dilated veins might be effective for the treatment of TN in such recurrent cases.

AB Recent approval of unprecedented gene therapies has signaled the beginning of a new era in modern medicine. This rapidly changing landscape underscores the importance of neurosurgeons developing a fundamental understanding of gene therapy, because many neurologic disorders are caused by derangements in gene expression. Gene therapy, the transfer of genetic material to alter endogenous gene expression or introduce exogenous genes, has emerged as a novel therapeutic approach to treat a wide range of diseases. There are several methods to transfer genetic material to the nervous system through viral transduction. Here, we synthesize the latest developments in gene therapy for neurologic disorders and the neurosurgical approaches to treat them.

TI Optimizing Patient Access During an Emergency While Using Intraoperative
   Computed Tomography
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
LA English
DT Article
DE Education; Intraoperative imaging; Operating room safety; Patient
   safety; Quality improvement; Resuscitation; Spine
AB BACKGROUND: As minimally invasive spine surgery evolves, spine surgeons increasingly rely on advanced intraoperative computed tomography (iCT). iCT provides rapid acquisition of high-resolution images, reduces radiation exposure, improves surgical accuracy, and decreases operative time. However, all iCT systems currently available pose a patient safety risk as their physical space requirements limit patient access in the event of an emergency, particularly when patients are in the prone position. After a near-cardiac arrest at our institution during posterior cervical spine surgery, it was apparent that the presence of the iCT complicated the ability to rapidly reposition the patient in order to provide appropriate resuscitation.
   METHODS: To ensure our ability to provide timely care during an emergency, we determined that a process which included all members of the operating room (OR) team was required. We held an initial planning meeting where a detailed plan-of-action was created, reviewed, and revised in response to feedback from all stakeholders. We then simulated a cardiac arrest to test our resuscitation plan with all members of the neurosurgery team. A mannequin was positioned prone on an OR table within the iCT, and a resuscitation plan was created.
   RESULTS: The team orchestrated the mock resuscitation, and the time of cardiac arrest in the prone position to supine repositioning required 110 seconds. The simulation was recorded for post-"code" performance review. Application of the protocol during an actual cardiac arrest was associated with successful restoration of spontaneous circulation and full recovery.
   CONCLUSIONS: The development and rehearsal of an emergency plan of action greatly facilitated the timely responsiveness of the neurosurgical OR team during a simulated cardiac arrest and was an effective way to identify and address key logistical issues regarding the use of an iCT system.

AB OBJECTIVE: To investigate key anatomic features of the vidian canal that have a critical role in planning and performing endoscopic skull base surgeries.
   METHODS: We reviewed skull base computed tomographic images of 640 consecutive subjects. Studies were analyzed in axial, coronal and sagittal planes.
   RESULTS: The mean (+/- SD) length of the vidian canal was 15.4 +/- 2.0 mm in female subjects and 16.6 +/- 1.7 mm in male subjects, and the difference between genders was statistically significant (P<0.001). The most common rostral-caudal course of the vidian canal was medial to lateral and was followed by the straight course, tortuous course, and lateral-to-medial course. The frequency of pneumatization pattern from most common to least common was types 0, III, II and I. Of 342 evaluated sides, the vidian canal was located below the level of the anterior genu of petrous ICA in 303 (89%) sides, at same level with the anterior genu of petrous ICA in twenty-five(7%) sides, and above the level of the anterior genu of petrous ICA in fourteen(4.1%) sides.
   CONCLUSIONS: A variety of previously undefined features of the vidian canal that can alter the course of surgical procedure were defined. The position of the vidian canal with respect to the petrous internal carotid artery (ICA) was extensively described. From a surgical standpoint, a working room inferior and medial to the vidian canal might not always be a safe approach, because the vidian canal could be located superior to the level of the anterior genu of petrous ICA according to our findings in the present study.

AB OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate regional variations in use of opioids after lumbar decompression and fusion surgery for patients with symptomatic lumbar stenosis or spondylolisthesis.
   METHODS: An insurance database, including private/commercially insured and Medicare Advantage beneficiaries, was queried for patients undergoing 1-level, 2-level, or 3-level index lumbar decompression and fusion procedures between 2007 and 2016. Research records were searchable by International Classification of Diseases diagnosis and procedure codes, and generic drug codes specific to Humana. Opioid use 6 months before index surgery to 2 years after surgery was assessed.
   RESULTS: Of the 13,257 patients included in the study, 63.1% were from the South, 24.3% from the Midwest, 10.5% from the West, and 2.1% from the Northeast. Of patients, 57.8% had a history of opioid use before index surgery, of whom 64.4% were from the South and 23.0% from the Midwest. Over the 6-month preoperative period, 51.6 opioid pills were billed by opioid users monthly (Midwest, 52.7 pills/patient/month; Northeast, 64.9 pills/patient/month; South, 50.6 pills/patient/month; West, 52.2 pills/patient/month). During the 2-year period after surgery, an average of 33.6 opioid pills were billed by opioid users monthly (Midwest, 32.9 pills/patient/month; Northeast, 35.4 pills/patient/month; South, 33.9 pills/patient/month; West, 32.9 pills/patient/month). In a multivariate logistic regression analysis, receiving treatment in the South (odds ratio, 1.18; 95% confidence interval, 1.07-1.29) or West (odds ratio, 1.26; 95% confidence interval, 1.10-1.45) was independently associated with prolonged (> 1 year) opioid use after index surgery.
   CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that regional variations may exist in the use of opioids after lumbar decompression and fusion surgery for patients with symptomatic lumbar stenosis or spondylolisthesis.

DT Article

AB BACKGROUND: Previous work in anaplastic astrocytoma (AA) demonstrated that the survival benefit from gross total resection (GTR) is modified by age and tumor location. Here, we determined the influence of age and tumor location on survival benefit from GTR in diffuse astrocytoma (DA).
   METHODS: We used the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database (1999e2010). We used KaplanMeier curves and Cox survival models to determine the survival benefit from GTR in populations stratified by age and tumor location. We determined the prevalence of the mutated isocitrate dehydrogenase (mIDH) using The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA).
   RESULTS: We identified 1980 patients with DA. For frontal DAs, GTR resulted in improved survival relative to subtotal resection in all ages (age <= 50 years hazard ratio [HR], 0.56; P = 0.002; age > 50 years HR, 0.41; P < 0.001). For nonfrontal DAs, only patients <= 50 years experienced improved survival with GTR (age <= 50 years HR, 0.55; P = 0.002; age > 50 years HR, 0.78; P = 0.114). For patients <= 50 years with frontal tumors, survival was comparable between DA and AA after GTR (75% survival DA: 80 months, AA: 89 months, P = 0.973). In TCGA, these tumors were nearly uniformly mIDH (DA: 98%; AA: 90%, P = 0.11). However, for patients <= 50 years with nonfrontal tumors, there was a survival difference after GTR (75% survival DA: 80 months, AA: 30 months, P = 0.001) despite comparable mIDH prevalence (DA: 82%, AA: 75%, P = 0.49).
   CONCLUSIONS: Age and tumor location modify the survival benefit derived from GTR in DA. Survival patterns in SEER imperfectly correlated with mIDH prevalence in TCGA, suggesting that tumor grade and mIDH status convey nonredundant prognostic information in select clinical contexts.

AB OBJECTIVE: Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most common adult primary brain tumor. Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) has been studied for the past decade, and conflicting results have been reported with no conclusive role established yet. Human papillomavirus (HPV) is involved in the pathogenesis of many cancers and has a high prevalence in patients with cervical and oral cancer in Pakistan. The objective of our study was to identify the prevalence of HCMV and HPV in Pakistani patients with primary GBM.
   METHODS: In total, 112 primary GBM biopsies were analyzed. HCMV and HPV infection was investigated using nested and conventional polymerase chain reaction, respectively. Positive HPV samples were further confirmed through sequencing. HPV status was correlated with histology and expression of other frequently mutated GBM molecular markers.
   RESULTS: Our study comprised of 68% male and 32% female patients. HCMV was detected in only 1 patient whereas HPV infection was present in 28% of patients with no cases of HPV and HCMV coinfection. We report for the first time that a majority of HPV-positive patients with GBM harbored types 16 and 18 both. Among them, 16% were HPV-type 16 and 20% were HPV-type 18. Patients infected with HPV had longer survival times, but this was not statistically significant. The most commonly overexpressed molecular marker in HPV-positive patients was cyclo-oxygenase-2, and no histologic changes were seen in HPV-positive GBM cases.
   CONCLUSIONS: The presence of a single HCMV positive is intriguing. In addition, we discovered a substantially high 28% prevalence of HPV in GBM patients. The role of viruses in gliomagenesis warrants further investigation.

DE Anatomy; Clival diploic veins; Clivus; Emissary veins; Transclival veins
AB INTRODUCTION: The clivus is a small, central area of the basal cranium with limited surgical access and high morbidity associated with pathologies of its surrounding structures. Therefore thorough knowledge and understanding of the anatomy in this region are crucial for the success of treatments and interpretation of imaging. As to our knowledge, there is no extant cadaveric examination of the transclival veins, so the present study was performed.
   METHODS: Fifteen lightly embalmed adult heads underwent blue latex injection of the left and right internal jugular veins. Special attention was given to the presence or absence of transclival vessels. When transclival veins were identified, their intracranial source, point of penetration of the clivus and anterior connections were documented.
   RESULTS: Ten (66.7%) specimens were found to have transclival veins. These connected the basilar venous plexus to the retropharyngeal venous plexus on all specimens. Eight of the 10 specimens had multiple transclival veins, and 2 had only 1 vessel. The majority of the transclival veins were found penetrating the clivus at its lower one third. However, 2 specimens also had transclival veins that pierced the clivus at its upper one third.
   CONCLUSIONS: An improved understanding of the skull base and its venous drainage can assist clinicians and surgeons in better understanding normal, pathologic, and variant anatomy in this region.

AB BACKGROUND: The effect of marital status and living arrangements on health through modified health behaviors and social networks has been well-established in reported studies, with many experts claiming a "protective" effect from married life for individuals. We sought to study the effect of marital and socioeconomic status (SES) on the outcomes of patients with spinal cord tumors.
   METHODS: The Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program was queried for patients with spinal cord tumors from 2004 to 2014. Patients were separated into 4 groups according to their marital status: single/never married, married/living together, divorced/separated, and widowed. SES was calculated using a validated method. Kaplan-Meier curves and multivariable logistic and Cox regression analyses were used to investigate the relationship between marital status and SES and the mortality rate of patients with available follow-up information.
   RESULTS: Of the 1188 patients identified (683 women [57.5%] and 505 men [42.5%]), 241 (20.3%) were in the single group, 732 (61.6%) in the married/living together, 109 (9.2%) in the divorced/separated, and 106 (8.9%) in the widowed group. Compared with married patients, divorced/separated and widowed patients had a greater mortality rate (hazard ratio [HR], 1.76; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.1-2.9; P=0.02; HR, 2.01; 95% CI, 1.3-3.1; P = 0.001, respectively). Male sex compared with female was associated with lower survival (HR, 1.42; 95% CI, 1.03-1.9; P = 0.03). Patients with greater SES had a lower mortality rate (HR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.55-1.08; P = 0.143).
   CONCLUSION: Unmarried and widowed status, lower SES, and male sex resulted in a greater risk of mortality. These factors should be considered when tailoring the treatment plan for such patients.

ID RELIABILITY; CARE
AB BACKGROUND: Pupillary light reflex examinations are intrinsic to any good neurological examination. Consistent evidence has shown that automated pupillometry assessments provide superior accuracy and interrater correlation compared with bedside eye examinations. Pupillary indexes such as the neurological pupil index (NPI) can also provide several hours of warning before the advent of herniation syndromes or third nerve palsy.
   METHODS: We determined the unique temporal relationship between NPI changes and third nerve palsy occurrence and recovery in an initially neurologically intact hospitalized patient. A 53-year-old woman presented with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage and headaches. Her aneurysm was treated surgically without complications. After lumbar drainage for hydrocephalus, she developed isolated left third nerve palsy that slowly recovered over the following weeks. Pupilometer data were obtained throughout her hospital stay.
   RESULTS: A total of 121 pupillary measurement sets were obtained. The NPI had decreased to an abnormal level (< 3) 12 hours before she became symptomatic. The NPI also started improving 24 hours before improvement in her clinical examination. The patient did not display signs of neurological dysfunction related to vasospasm during her stay.
   CONCLUSION: The NPI seems to reliably correlate with third nerve function and appears to possess predictive temporal properties that could allow practitioners to anticipate neurological injury and recovery. These findings could affect the fields of neurosciences, trauma, military medicine, critical care, and ophthalmology.

ID RADIATION-EXPOSURE; CANCER-RISKS; CT SCANS; CHILDHOOD
AB BACKGROUND: Patients with a ventriculoperitoneal shunt for hydrocephalus often undergo multiple follow-up computed tomography (CT) scans of the head, increasing the risk for long-term effects of ionizing radiation. The purpose of our study was to evaluate the necessity as a routine diagnostic procedure and cost analysis of routine postoperative CT scan of the head after ventriculoperitoneal shunt surgery.
   METHODS: In this study, we comprised adults with ventriculoperitoneal shunt operations who underwent early CT scans within 48 hours postoperatively. We reviewed the correlation between revision surgery rate and the experience of surgeons who performed surgery and provided a cost analysis.
   RESULTS: In total, 479 surgeries were performed in 439 patients. Early revision surgery was performed in 11 (2.3%) patients. Reason for revision surgery was malposition in 9 cases and intracerebral hemorrhage in 2 patients. There was no significant correlation between the surgeon's experience and the rate of revision surgery. Placement of the ventricular catheter via an approach other than a standard right or left frontal burr hole resulted in risk of need for surgical shunt revision (P >= 0.002, odds ratio 54, confidence interval 13.5-223). A total of 468 CT scans of the head revealed a normal finding; thus, similar to$ 562,000 could be saved by omitting postoperative head CT scans.
   CONCLUSIONS: Routine postoperative head CT scans after fentriculoperitoneal shunting are not necessary in all cases. The reduction of exposure to ionization radiation and the beneficial economic factor are main advantages.

ID CHILDREN; ASTROCYTOMAS; IRRADIATION; AGE
AB OBJECTIVE: The purpose of the present study was to characterize the acute (30-day) surgical risk profile of pediatric patients undergoing surgical resection of intramedullary spinal cord tumors (IMSCTs).
   METHODS: Preoperative factors were collected from the Pediatric American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program database for patients identified by Current Procedural Terminology codes for laminectomy and International Classification of Diseases codes for IMSCTs from 2012 to 2016. The postoperative outcomes were compared by tumor location and type.
   RESULTS: The mean age of the 139 patients meeting all inclusion criteria was 8.7 years, with a male predominance (58.7%). The cervical and thoracic IMSCT populations had worst preoperative health status, as indicated by American Society of Anesthesiologists class, and a greater proportion of malignant tumors compared with the lumbar IMSCT population. No patient died; 8.6% of the patients were readmitted, and 6.5% required reoperation. Of the 12 read-missions, 8 were required for patients with malignant tumors. The patients with cervical IMSCTs returned to the operating room at a significantly greater rate than did the thoracic and lumbar IMSCT populations. Two common reasons for reoperation in the cervical population were issues related to respiration and hydrocephalus management. The complications included 13 cases of infection, 6 of urinary tract infection, and 5 cases of surgical site infection.
   CONCLUSIONS: Resection of IMSCTs in the pediatric population is a relatively low-risk procedure in terms of acute surgical complications. However, surgeons operating in the cervical spine should be aware of the increased risk of reoperation, in particular as it pertains to respiratory issues and hydrocephalus.

   COMPLICATIONS; EEG; MORBIDITY; MORTALITY; OUTCOMES
AB BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Anterior temporal lobectomy (ATL) is the most common surgical procedure for refractory temporal lobe epilepsy. When scalp electroencephalography cannot adequately identify an epileptogenic site, electrode implantation may be used to monitor epileptic activity and localize a target focus before surgical resection. Whether the advantage of improved seizure localization justifies the added risk of electrode placement remains unclear. : The present study uses an international surgical database to explore whether a 2wo-stage approach, electrode implant followed by ATL, has a reasonable safety profile and is clinically worthwhile versus ATL alone.
   METHODS: Data from the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program for 2005 to 2016 were queried to identify patients undergoing ATL or electrode implant for epilepsy. The 30-day postoperative outcomes were analyzed for the electrode implant and ATL groups, and individual and combined risk profiles were determined.
   RESULTS: Patients undergoing electrode implant followed by ATL had a predicted reoperation rate of 7.6%, readmission rate of 14.6%, and a 30-day mortality rate of 1.2%. The combined rate of patients having >= 1 medical complication for 2-staged procedures was higher, at 14.7%. The most common complications encountered were urinary tract infection (2.7%) and sepsis (2.7%).
   CONCLUSIONS: Intracranial electrode placement increases the risk of complications when added to ATL. The severity of complications from electrode placement are mild, however, and as intracranial electrode recording provides a potentially large reduction in the surgical failure risk, electrode placement may be advisable for all but the most convincing seizure foci.

AB OBJECTIVE: Intracranial dural arteriovenous fistulas (DAVFs) can manifest with a reversible form of dementia and parkinsonism that may be related to medullary venous hypertension and impaired cortical venous drainage. We report a consecutive case series of patients with DAVFs who presented with cognitive decline and report angioarchitecture and outcomes of treatment.
   METHODS: From a prospectively collected database of 389 cranial DAVFs, we identified patients who presented with progressive dementia. Data collected included demographic characteristics, other presenting symptoms, fistula location and type, preoperative and postoperative imaging findings, and treatment outcomes. Descriptive statisticswere reported.
   RESULTS: Of 389 patients with DAVF, 6 patients with progressive dementia (1.4%) were identified. All patients were male. Mean patient age was 68.6 years. Four patients had superior sagittal sinus DAVFs, 1 patient had a tentorialDAVF, and 1 patient had a transverse sinus DAVF. All patients had evidence of medullary venous hypertension on imaging with either reflux and arterialization of the transmedullary veins or venous congestion of the transmedullary veins. All patients underwent endovascular treatment and had reversal of dementia-related symptoms after a mean follow-up of 6.2 months.
   CONCLUSIONS: Cognitive decline is a rare but reversible manifestation of DAVFs that have impaired venous drainage of the transmedullary veins and associated medullary venous hypertension.

TI Can Early Postoperative O-(2-(18F)Fluoroethyl)-L-Tyrosine Positron

AB OBJECTIVE: Glioblastoma inevitably recurs despite aggressive therapy. Therefore, it would be helpful to predict the location of tumor recurrence from postoperative imaging to customize further treatment. O-(2-(18)Ffluoroethyl)-L-tyrosine (FET) positron emission tomography (PET) might be a helpful technique, because tumor tissue can be differentiated from normal brain tissue with high specificity.
   METHODS: Thirty-two consecutive patients with perioperative and follow-up imaging data available were included. On postoperative FET-PET, the tumor/normal brain (TTB) ratio around the resection cavity borders was measured. Increased TTB ratios were recorded and anatomically correlated with the site of later tumor recurrence. On postoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), residual contrast-enhancing tumor correlated with the site of later tumor recurrence.
   RESULTS: Location of progression was predictable using MRI alone in 42% of patients by residual tumor on postoperative MRI. FET-PET was predictive in 25 patients by a clear hot spot at the site of later tumor recurrence. In 3 patients, it was partially predictive and in 4 was not predictive of the tumor recurrence location. One patient without any tracer uptake was recurrence free at the last follow-up examination. In contrast to the postoperative MRI results, tumor recurrence was found in 79% at a site of elevated TTB ratio on postoperative FET-PET. Therefore, the predictability of the tumor recurrence location using postoperative FET-PET was greater than that with MRI, and all cases predictable using MRI could have been predicted using FET-PET.
   CONCLUSIONS: Postoperative FET-PET can be helpful for planning subsequent therapy, such as repeat resection or radiotherapy, because tumor recurrence can be predicted with relatively greater sensitivity than with MRI alone.

AB OBJECTIVE: The aims of this retrospective cohort study were to 1) identify new alignment risk factors for proximal junctional kyphosis (PJK) in adult spinal deformity (ASD) patients with lower thoracic upper instrumented vertebra (UIV) and 2) determine the effect of junctional tethers on PJK and UIV alignment.
   METHODS: We analyzed consecutive ASD patients who underwent posterior instrumented fusion with lower thoracic UIV (T9-T11). Posteriorly anchored junctional tethers were used more recently for ligamentous augmentation to prevent PJK. In addition to regional and global parameters, upper segmental lumbar lordosis (ULL) versus lower segmental lumbar lordosis and UIV angle (measured from UIV inferior endplate to horizontal) were assessed. Primary outcome of PJK was defined as proximal junctional angle > 10 degrees and > 10 degrees greater than the corresponding preoperative measurement. Univariable and multivariable analyses were performed.
   RESULTS: The study cohort comprised 120 ASD patients (mean age, 67 years) with minimum 1-year follow-up. Preoperative ULL (P = 0.034) and UIV angle (P = 0.026) were associated with PJK. No independent preoperative alignment risk factors of PJK were identified in multivariable analysis. Tether use was protective against PJK (odds ratio, 0.063 [0.016-0.247]; P < 0.001). PJK in tethered patients was more common with greater postoperative ULL (P = 0.047) and UIV angle (P = 0.026).
   CONCLUSIONS: Junctional tethers significantly reduced PJK in ASD patients with lower thoracic UIV. In tethered patients, PJK was more common with greater postoperative lordosis of the upper lumbar spine and greater UIV angle. This finding suggests potential benefit of tethers to mitigate effects of segmental lumbar and focal UIV malalignment that may occur after deformity surgery.

AB OBJECTIVES: Gross total resection for glioblastoma (GBM) has been associated with better prognosis. However, it is not always feasible, and the threshold for the extent of resection required for better prognosis has been controversial. Therefore, we compared the survival and clinical outcomes of patients with GBM who had undergone partial resection (PR) or biopsy.
   METHODS: Of the 110 patients, 32 and 78, who had undergone PR and biopsy, respectively, were enrolled to identify any differences in clinical outcomes. No differences were found in patient demographics between the 2 groups, except for tumor location and mean tumor volume (P = 0.02 and P < 0.01, respectively). Propensity score matching between the PR and biopsy groups was performed, in which 20 patients each in the PR and biopsy groups were matched.
   RESULTS: The overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) did not differ significantly between the PR and biopsy groups (P = 0.84 and P = 0.48, respectively). After propensity score matching, the differences in OS and PFS between the 2 groups were still not statistically significant (P = 0.51 and P = 0.75, respectively). The hazard ratios for OS and PFS for the PR group compared with biopsy were 0.98 and 0.73, respectively; however, the difference was not statistically significant (P = 0.96 and P = 0.39, respectively). The surgical complication rate was greater in the PR group (14 of 32; 43.7%) than in the biopsy group (9 of 78; 11.5%; P < 0.01).
   CONCLUSIONS: PR failed to improve survival compared with biopsy for patients with GBM. Moreover, the surgical complication rate in the PR group was greater than that in the biopsy group.

AB OBJECTIVE: The endoscopic technique is in many cases the technique of choice for the removal of pituitary adenomas. Extended endoscopic approaches make it possible to remove lesions with suprasellar and parasellar extension and fibrous consistency. We identify some characteristics that might point to the adoption of an expanded approach in the preoperative phase.
   METHODS: We considered 66 consecutive cases treated for pituitary macroadenomas. All patients underwent preoperative magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography, as well as postoperative magnetic resonance imaging. From the analysis of surgical reports and preoperative radiologic investigations, we extracted data related to size, extension, morphologic characteristics, consistency, and type of approach used (sellar or expanded). The degree of removal was judged to be total, near total, subtotal, or partial.
   RESULTS: The data showed that in some cases it is possible to assume in advance that there is a need for an expanded endoscopic approach. The features that led to an extended approach for extracapsular dissection of the lesion were the size of the tumor; an hourglass/dumbbell shape; lateral extension to the suprasellar carotid artery; Knosp degree 3 or 4; contrast enhancement heterogeneity; intratumoral hemorrhage, erosion, or discontinuity of the sellar floor; and increased sellar depth, which predicts increased thickness.
   CONCLUSIONS: The ability to predict the consistency of pituitary adenomas allows the surgeon to design a surgical procedure tailored to the patient. This approach has advantages concerning the extent of resection and allows a radical strategy with a single surgical procedure to be pursued.

AB BACKGROUND: Interhospital transfers for endovascular thrombectomy (EVT) evaluation have increased since the publication of landmark neuroendovascular stroke trials in 2015. The lack of guidelines to select potential EVT candidates prior to transfer can lead to instances where, despite considerable costs and transport risks, transferred patients do not ultimately undergo EVT. Our aim was to characterize the patterns and identify predictors for EVT on transfer.
   METHODS: In this observational cohort study, we retrospectively analyzed patients with acute ischemic stroke (AIS) transferred to our institution for EVT evaluation from January 2015 to March 2016. Clinical and radiographic predictors for EVT on transfer were determined with multivariable logistic regression analysis.
   RESULTS: A total of 103 transfer patients with AIS were included in the study, and 52% were women. A higher collateral score (P < 0.01), a higher National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score (P < 0.01), computed tomography angiography (CTA) at referring hospital (P < 0.01), and large vessel occlusion on arrival CTA (P < 0.01) were significant in patients who underwent EVT on univariable analysis. More than half (61.1%) of transfers were futile and primarily related to absence of large vessel occlusion on arrival. A higher collateral score (P = 0.02), a higher NIHSS score (P = 0.006), and having undergone a CTA at the referring center (P = 0.002) remained the independent predictors of EVT. The C statistic for the model was 0.94.
   CONCLUSIONS: A higher collateral score, the acquisition of CTA imaging at the referring centers, and a higher NIHSS score independently predicted EVT on transfer.

AB OBJECTIVE: Apparently similar intra-axial pontine lesions may demand distinct surgical approaches. Selecting the optimal approach reduces unnecessary manipulation of tracts and nuclei. This study aims to reveal a quantitative analysis of main surgical corridors dealing with intrinsic pontine pathology.
   METHODS: Six approaches were performed repeatedly in 10 cadaveric heads: 1) retrosigmoid, 2) retrolabyrinthine, 3) subtemporal transtentorial, 4) anterior petrosectomy, 5) combined petrosal approach, and 6) suboccipital telovelar. Six safe entry zones were studied: peritrigeminal, supratrigeminal, lateral pontine, supracollicular, infracollicular, and median sulcus of fourth ventricle. A neuronavigation device was used to collect 3-dimensional coordinates from fixed points over the edge of craniotomies and brainstem surface; 4 variables were studied: 1) angles of attack; 2) areas of exposure; 3) lengths of exposure; and 4) trajectories.
   RESULTS: The mean area of exposure generated by the retrosigmoid approach over the brainstem was 538.6 +/- 161.0 mm(2), whereas that yielded by the retrolabyrinthine was 475.0 +/- 173.4 mm(2). There were no significant differences between both when considering areas of exposure and angles. Adding a tentorial cut to the subtemporal approach exposed the superior part of the lateral surface of pons; the area of exposure increased a mean of 33% (P < 0.001).
   CONCLUSIONS: In addition to producing similar areas and angles of attack, the retrolabyrinthine yields a more orthogonal trajectory to lateral pons than the retrosigmoid approach. Adding a tentorial cut and anterior petrosectomy significantly increased areas and lengths of exposure of a regular subtemporal approach. The combined approach significantly increased angles of attack to both the supratrigeminal and lateral pontine safe zones.

AB BACKGROUND: Traditionally, nonoperative management with long-term antibiotics and bed rest has been recommended as first-line treatment for most patients with postoperative discitis. A recent trend in treatment under a limited range of indications has been to perform surgical debridement followed by long-term administration of antibiotics. This descriptive study investigated whether transforaminal lumbar interbody debridement and fusion (TLIDF) combined with intravenous antibiotics is appropriate to manage postdiscectomy discitis.
   METHODS: This study retrospectively analyzed demographic data, laboratory data, and radiography and magnetic resonance imaging of 10 patients with postoperative discitis who underwent surgical TLIDF followed by antibiotic treatment. Preoperative and postoperative spine sagittal alignment, visual analog scale scores, and KirkaldyWillis criteria for functional outcomes were evaluated.
   RESULTS: An infection clearance rate of 100% was ultimately achieved for the patients who underwent TLIDF with short posterior instrumentation. TLIDF yielded better outcomes than traditional conservative treatment in terms of spine alignment correction, functional outcomes, and quality of life.
   CONCLUSIONS: Based on previously reported data and the findings of this study, we suggest that surgical intervention should be used in certain cases, as it can achieve better outcomes than conservative treatment. We recommend a novel single posterior approach with TLIDF and posterior pedicle screw instrumentation for management of postdiscectomy discitis.

AB INTRODUCTION: With a rapidly expanding elderly population in the United States, the incidence of pituitary adenomas in elderly will continue to rise. In this study, we aim to evaluate the safety and efficacy of transsphenoidal endoscopic endonasal resection for pituitary adenomas in the elderly population.
   METHODS: A retrospective review of 131 consecutive patients who underwent transsphenoidal endoscopic endonasal resection for pituitary adenomas at the University of Miami Hospital between 2012 and 2016 was performed. Preoperative, intraoperative, and surgical outcomes were analyzed in elderly (> 70 years) versus nonelderly (< 70 years) patients.
   RESULTS: Of the 131 patients, 23 of them were > 70 years (18%), of which 14 were septuagenarians and 9 were octogenarians. Elderly patients were more likely to present with vision loss (80.8% vs. 56.6%; P = 0.013) and larger tumors on imaging (2.7 +/- 1.0 cm vs. 2.4 +/- 1.3 cm; P = 0.042). Overall surgical and endocrinologic outcomes between the 2 groups were similar. However, patients < 70 years old were more likely to have a gross total resection (86.7% vs. 65.4%; P = 0.011), as well as transient diabetes insipidus (54.3% vs. 26.9% P = 0.012) and intraoperative cerebrospinal fluid leak (83.5% vs. 58.5%; P = 0.013). However, permanent postoperative complication rates were similar including rate of permanent diabetes insipidus (4.3% elderly vs. 12.1% adult), cerebrospinal fluid leak (8.7% elderly vs. 8.4% adult), and meningitis (4.3% elderly vs. 2.8% adult). There were no medical complications or deaths in our cohort.
   CONCLUSION: The transsphenoidal endoscopic endonasal approach can be a safe and effective technique for resection of pituitary adenomas in patients > 70 years old with appropriate patient selection.

   DISSECTION
AB OBJECTIVE: To determine clinical and radiologic outcomes of vertebral artery dissecting aneurysms involving posterior inferior cerebellar artery according to different types of endovascular treatment.
   METHODS: This study included 18 vertebral artery dissecting aneurysms (6 ruptured and 12 unruptured) involving posterior inferior cerebellar artery treated from January 2009 to December 2016. Treatments were multiple stenting, stent-assisted coil embolization, vertebral artery trapping with vertebral artery-posterior inferior cerebellar artery stenting, and Pipeline embolization. Clinical and radiologic information were obtained from retrospective chart review and radiologic review.
   RESULTS: Subarachnoid hemorrhage was diagnosed initially in 6 of 18 patients, and infarction was diagnosed initially in 2 patients. Multiple stenting was performed in 4 patients, including 1 (25%) who had cerebellar infarction and 1 (25%) who had recurrence. Stent-assisted coil embolization was performed in 8 patients, including 1 (12.5%) who had postoperative cerebellar infarction and 2 (25%) who had recurrence. Vertebral artery trapping with vertebral artery-posterior inferior cerebellar artery stenting was performed in 4 patients, including 1 (25%) who had postoperative cerebellar infarction. There was no recurrence (0%). Pipeline embolization was performed in 2 patients, including 1 (50%) who had recurrence. There was no postoperative infarction (0%). No subarachnoid hemorrhage occurred during follow-up. Deterioration in modified Rankin Scale score was found only in the stent-assisted coil embolization group (1/8; 12.5%).
   CONCLUSIONS: Vertebral artery trapping with vertebral artery-posterior inferior cerebellar artery stenting showed the lowest rate of aneurysm recurrence with high rate of minor infarction and favorable neurologic outcome. Stent-assisted coil embolization showed high recurrence rates with possible fatal disabling infarction.

DT Article
DE Orbitozygomatic; Pretemporal; Pterional; Surgical technique
ID QUANTIFICATION; CRANIOTOMY
AB OBJECTIVE: Although pterional craniotomy and its variants are the most used approaches in neurosurgery, few studies have evaluated their precise indications. We evaluate the pterional (PT), pretemporal (PreT), and orbitozygomatic (OZ) approaches through quantitative measurements of area, linear, and angular exposures of the major intracranial vascular structures.
   METHODS: Eight fresh, adult cadavers were operated with the PT, followed by the PreT, and ending with the OZ approach. The working area, angular exposure of vascular structures and linear exposure of the basilar artery were measured.
   RESULTS: The OZ approach presented a wider area (1301.3 +/- 215.9 mm(2)) with an increase of 456.7 mm(2) compared with the PT and of 167.4 mm(2) to the PreT (P = 0.011). The extension from PT to PreT and OZ increases linear exposure of the basilar artery. When comparing the PreT and OZ, we found an increase in the horizontal and vertical angle to the bifurcation of the ipsilateral middle cerebral artery (P = 0.005 and P = 0.032, respectively), horizontal angle to the basilar artery tip (P = 0.02), and horizontal angle to the contralateral ICA bifurcation (P = 0.048).
   CONCLUSIONS: The OZ approach offered notable surgical advantages compared with the traditional PT and PreT regarding to the area of exposure and linear exposure to basilar artery. Regarding angle of attack, the orbital rim and zygomatic arch removal provided quantitatively wider exposure and increased surgical freedom. A detailed anatomic study for each patient and surgeon experience must be considered for individualized surgical approach indication.

TI Management of Choroid Plexus Tumors in Infants and Young Children Up to
   4 Years of Age: An Institutional Experience
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
LA English
DT Article
DE Choroid plexus tumors; Intraventricular; Young age
ID BLOOD-LOSS; CARCINOMA; SURVIVAL
AB BACKGROUND: Choroid plexus tumors (CPTs) are rare tumors characterized by papillary and intraventricular growth. The young age of presentation of such tumors, especially in infants, and the lack of consensus on adjuvant therapy in case of atypical choroid plexus papilloma (aCPP) and choroid plexus carcinoma (CPC) create dilemma for the management of such tumors. We discuss the presentation, management, complications, and outcome in 15 patients (children 4 years of age and younger) and review pertinent literature.
   METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the case records of all patients with CPTs who were operated in our institute from January 2010 to March 2018. We found 15 patients in the age group of 0-4 years of age. The variables analyzed include age, sex, presentation, location, surgical approach, extent of resection, intraoperative blood loss, percentage of blood loss, blood transfused, histopathology, postoperative complications, and outcome. Images were obtained from picture archiving and communication system, and patient details and follow-up were obtained from discharge summary, operative notes, and hospital records.
   RESULTS: Ten patients had choroid plexus papilloma (CPP), 2 patients had aCPP, and 3 patients had CPC. The mean age was 15.2 months, whereas the median age was 8 months (range, 40 dayse4 years). The mean blood loss was 329 mL, whereas the median blood loss was 175 mL. There were a total of 5 deaths, including 3 patients with CPC and 1 each with aCPP and CPP.
   CONCLUSIONS: CPTs are challenging tumors in infants and very young children because of the potential for massive blood loss. CPP is associated with lesser blood loss and favorable outcome compared with aCPP and CPC. Massive blood loss in CPC and aCPP can be life threatening as has been shown in our series. CPC has a rapid proliferation potential as shown in one of our cases. Attempts at decreasing vascularization of such tumors should be made by various methods, including preoperative embolization and neoadjuvant chemotherapy; however, a consensus on this is lacking.

AB BACKGROUND: During the past decades, stereotactic radiosurgery, and Gamma Knife in particular, has proved its safety and efficacy for drug-resistant classic trigeminal neuralgia. However, few large series exist using linear accelerator (LINAC) reporting long-term follow-up.
   METHODS: Between 2006 and 2015, 301 patients were treated by LINAC at our institution. The prescribed radiation dose was 90 Gy at the far anterior target. Clinical response was defined using the Barrow Neurological Institute scale. We considered grades I and IIIa as a successful response. Mean duration of follow-up was 54.6 months (range, 12-132 months).
   RESULTS: Two hundred and seventy-three patients (90.7%) were initially pain free, and 28 patients (9.3%) were unchanged. The actuarial probabilities of maintaining pain relief with or without medication (Barrow Neurological Institute grade I and IIIa) at 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 5, and 10 years were 88.7%, 85.0%, 76.1%, 68.8%, 65.8%, and 48.1%, respectively. Hypesthesia was present in only 26.2% of patients (very bothersome, 0.3%). No anesthesia dolorosa was reported. The actuarial probabilities of maintaining pain relief without further surgery at 0.5, 1, 2, 4, and 5 years were 99.3%, 98.3%, 95.8%, 91.0%, and 89.7%, respectively. Among all treated patients, 86.5% were satisfied by the procedure and would undergo stereotactic radiosurgery again.
   CONCLUSIONS: Stereotactic radiosurgery with dedicated LINAC is associated with high rates of long-term pain relief, with minimal invasiveness and rare complications. LINAC is a possible therapeutic alternative for drug-resistant trigeminal neuralgia and could be proposed to selected patients as the first intention therapy, among other surgical solutions.
