AB BACKGROUND: To our knowledge, few studies have focused on delayed postoperative neurologic deficit (DPND) after spine deformity surgery.
   OBJECTIVES: This study was intended to investigate the incidence, risk factors, treatments, and outcomes of DPND after corrective surgery for spinal deformity in a single spine center.
   METHODS: The database of a single spine center was queried for dates from 2002 to 2014 to identify all spinal deformity cases. The variables extracted included patient age, diagnosis, procedure, whether neuromonitoring was used and if so which methods were used, whether neuromonitoring abnormalities were detected, whether new neurologic deficits occurred, whether implants were used, and the degree of recovery from new neurologic deficits (none, partial, complete). The patients were classified as pediatric (<21 years old) or adult (>= 21 years old). The rates of DPND were tabulated and stratified on the basis of age, diagnosis, and surgical features.
   RESULTS: A total of 5377 cases were investigated from 2002 through 2014. Seven cases of DPND were reported (incidence, 0.13%). For adult patients, the overall incidence of DPND was 0.17%, and for pediatric patients, it was 0.10%. The incidence of DPND was 0.35% when osteotomies were performed and 0.05% without osteotomies. After the onset of neurologic deficits, loss of somatosensory evoked potentials occurred in 1 patient, and loss of motor evoked potentials occurred in all 7 patients. Revision surgery was performed for 3 patients. At the last follow-up visit, 1 patient experienced no recovery, 2 partial recovery, and 5 complete recovery.
   CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of DPND is low. Old age and osteotomies are risk factors for DPND. Most patients with DPND experience varying degrees of recovery.

   ACTIVATION; PARAMETER
AB BACKGROUND: Delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI) is a major cause of disability after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH). Activated platelets are surrogate markers for DCI occurrence and are reliably represented by mean platelet volume (MPV) to platelet count (PLT) ratio. If validated as a predictor of DCI, the ratio will allow clinicians to use it as a readily available tool in patient management.
   METHODS: Retrospective analysis of aSAH patient database at a tertiary care hospital. MPV: PLT ratio was defined as (MPV value (fL)/PLT per 1000 * 100). Nonlinear regression estimated differences in the ratio's pattern of change over time between those with or without DCI. Receiver operating characteristic curve determined optimal threshold of rise in MPV: PLT ratio to predict DCI.
   RESULTS: Average age of the cohort (n = 169) was 53.0 +/- 13.0 years, and 38 patients (22.5%) developed DCI. Nonlinear regression analysis detected a transition of rising and declining MPV: PLT ratio at 3 days after aSAH. Rate of rise in MPV: PLT ratio was 0.5 units/day (95% confidence interval 0.3-0.7) in patients developing DCI as compared with 0.2 units/day (95% confidence interval 0.1-0.3) in those without DCI (P = 0.0004). Receiver operating characteristic analysis determined a threshold of 0.33 units/day rise in MPV: PLT predicted DCI with 89.5% sensitivity and 90.8% specificity. Patients who died demonstrated a steeper rise during the first 3 days (0.29 units/day) than those who were discharged home (0.21 units/day) (P = 0.004).
   CONCLUSIONS: Trend of MPV: PLT ratio after aSAH predicts DCI. This association alludes to significant early rise in reactive platelet population after aSAH in patients developing DCI.

AB BACKGROUND: The literature on multiple intracranial aneurysms (MIA) in patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH) focuses largely on risk factor analysis and consists essentially of retrospective cohort studies of limited sample size, or studies in populations outside Europe and North America. The purpose of this cohort study was to identify predictors for aneurysm multiplicity and to investigate the anatomic distribution of MIA in a representative Western cohort of patients with aSAH.
   METHODS: The Swiss Study of Subarachnoid Hemorrhage (SOS) database includes anonymized data from all tertiary neurovascular facilities in Switzerland. The dataset for 2009-2014 was used to compare characteristics of patients with aSAH and MIA and those with a single intracranial aneurysm (SIA) by means of descriptive and multivariate regression analysis.
   RESULTS: Among 1689 unselected patientswith aSAH, 467 had MIA (prevalence, 27.6%). The location of the ruptured index aneurysmwas correlated with the probability of finding bystander aneurysms and predicted their likely anatomic distribution. Patients with a ruptured basilar artery aneurysm (odds ratio [OR], 2.11; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.30-3.44) or a ruptured middle cerebral artery aneurysm (OR, 1.86; 95% CI, 1.35-2.55) were at the greatest risk for having MIA. Larger size of the index aneurysm (OR per 1 mm, 1.03; 95% CI, 1.01-1.06) was also positively correlated with aneurysm multiplicity. Males were less likely than females to haveMIA (OR, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.61-1.01).
   CONCLUSIONS: In patients with aSAH, the location of the ruptured index aneurysm is correlated with the probability of finding bystander aneurysms, and is predictive of the sites at which bystander aneurysms are most likely to be found.

AB OBJECTIVES: The endoscopic approach increasingly is used to treat third ventricular colloid cysts. Our objective was to assess the results of endoscopic resection of colloid cysts of the third ventricle.
   METHODS: A retrospective study was designed, and a series of 112 consecutive patients (76 male, 36 female) with third ventricular colloid cyst treated by endoscopic surgery was undertaken.
   RESULTS: We found that the most common clinical presentations in patients with third ventricular colloid cyst were headache, vomiting, and impaired vision. Complete resection was obtained in majority of patients (92%). Meningitis, hemiparesis, and memory deficits occurred most commonly as postoperative complications.
   CONCLUSIONS: High rates of complete resection of third ventricular colloid cysts, with low morbidity and mortality, are possible with an endoscopic approach. The results of this study support the role of endoscopic resection in the treatment of patients with third ventricular colloid cysts as a safe and effective modality and show how endoscopic resection of third ventricular colloid cysts can produce favorable results.

ID MIDDLE FOSSA APPROACH; CRANIAL FOSSA; SURGERY; ANATOMY
AB BACKGROUND: The arcuate eminence (AE) has been traditionally used in middle cranial fossa (MCF) surgery as a guide to accurate location of the superior semicircular canal (SSC) deep within the temporal bone. However, the anatomic relationship between the AE and SSC is controversial. We evaluated the anatomic coincidence between the AE and the SSC in the MCF surface. Distances between the most relevant anatomic structures in the MCF and prevalence of SSC dehiscence were measured.
   METHODS: We analyzed 75 (150 sides) 0.75-mm slice thickness temporal bone computed tomography scans and classified the AE and SSC relationship as coincident and noncoincident. Radiologic findings were reported independently in a blind fashion by 2 authors. Data were presented as mean +/- SD or frequency and percentage. Student t test or an unequal variance t test was used. Interobserver agreement among readings was assessed using k statistic for categorical variables and intraclass Kendall tau-a correlations for continuous measures. P < 0.05 was considered to indicate statistical significance.
   RESULTS: The AE matched the SSC in only 31.3% of cases. The AE could be localized as lateral as 11.6 mm from the SSC. It was impossible to identify the AE in 33 scans (22.0%). SSC dehiscence was found in 5 cases (3.3%). A few millimeters separated most analyzed landmarks, and a wide variability in secondary measurements was observed.
   CONCLUSIONS: The AE does not systematically overlie the SSC and should not be routinely used as a reference to reach this structure in MCF surgery.

AB OBJECTIVE: The impact of obesity on spine surgery has been studied extensively, but only a few investigations have been focused on minimally invasive spinal fusion techniques and complication rates in normal-weight, pre-obese, or obese patients. Obesity was found to be a risk factor for intraoperative complications. Published data tend to favor minimal access surgery techniques (MAST) for obese patients. In a prospective study, we assessed the perioperative and postoperative complications of MAST in a large population of 187 patients.
   METHODS: We evaluated perioperative and postoperative complication rates in minimally invasive surgery (MIS) fusion techniques of the lumbar spine in obese, preobese, and normal-weight patients, classified by body mass index (BMI). Lumbar MIS fusion was performed by interbody fusion procedures and posterolateral fusion. In cases of spinal stenosis, a laminotomy was performed (146 patients). Any harmful event occurring during or after surgery was included in the statistical analysis.
   RESULTS: No infection or severe wound healing disorder was encountered in the series. No significant difference in terms of cerebrospinal fluid leakage, blood loss, drainage, or length of hospital stay between the 3 BMI groups was encountered. More clinically insignificant hematomas were encountered in the preobese and obese groups (P = 0.013) than in the normal-weight patients. No significant difference was registered between the BMI or age groups regarding overall complication rates.
   CONCLUSION: We conclude that preobese and obese patients are good candidates for MAST because BMI did not affect complication rates or duration of surgery.

AB BACKGROUND: The surgical Simpson grade, introduced in 1957, is the standard measure for meningioma resection and prediction of recurrences. We used an magnetic resonance (MR) ebased grading system for the radiologic extent of resection, and assessed agreement of the extent of resection between the surgical Simpson grade and the MR-based scale.
   METHODS: Patients were prospectively included during a 2-year period. Immediately after surgery, the surgeon determined the Simpson grade. MR imaging was performed within 72 hours and at 3 months after surgery. Scans were assessed by a neuroradiologist, blinded to the surgeon's grading. Intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and absolute agreement were used to evaluate agreement between both scales.
   RESULTS: Thirty-five patients (41 tumors) were included. Absolute agreement was 76%, with an ICC of 0.613. At 3 months postoperatively, the ICC and absolute agreement were 0.682 and 78%. In 20% of cases, the extent of resection was less favorable on the early postoperative MR imaging than the surgeon's Simpson grade.
   CONCLUSIONS: Agreement for extent of meningioma resection between both scales was good in terms of the ICC. When the surgical Simpson grade is unclear, MR imaging at 3 months after surgery may be used as a baseline for further follow-up. In a substantial portion of cases, the extent of resection was less favorable on the early postoperative MR imaging than the surgeon's Simpson grade. The predictive value of the radiologic extent of resection for the risk of long-term recurrences is a subject for further research.

AB OBJECTIVE: To determine infection rate (IR) and to identify modifiable risk factors (RF) in cranial neurosurgery in a neurosurgical department for tertiary referral as part of an infection control surveillance to reduce surgical site infections (SSI).
   METHODS: A prospective SSI incidence cohort study from February 2013 to January 2014 was performed in a tertiary-care neurosurgical teaching hospital and referral center. All consecutive adults undergoing any cranial neurosurgical procedure were included. Data were collected by a trained member of the infection control staff during the twice-weekly visits of the hospitalized patients. Follow-up was 30 days (procedures without implant) and 1 year (procedures involving permanent implants). SSI was diagnosed according to criteria of CDC.
   RESULTS: A total of 317 patients undergoing 333 index procedures were included. The median age was 61 years (range, 17-91 years) and 46% were female. Survival in patients with completed follow-up was 76% (196/258). Overall, IR was 7.2% (24/333 index procedures); in 96% (23/24), a neurosurgical implant was involved. The IR of extraventricular drainage (EVD) was 12.5% (13.1/1000 EVD days). The main causative pathogens were Staphylococcus aureus followed by coagulase-negative staphylococci and Propionibacterium acnes. Independent RF for neurosurgical SSI were EVD as part of the index operation and body mass index > 25 kg/m(2).
   CONCLUSIONS: IR was in accordance with recent prospective single-center studies (reported IR between 1.6% and 9%). EVD placement was identified as the strongest modifiable RF for SSI in cranial neurosurgical procedures. The need for standard infection control procedures for the insertion and maintenance of EVDs to avoid their contamination is reinforced.

AB BACKGROUND: Patients who have sustained aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH) are thought to have cognitive impairment. However, little is known about the characteristics of functional imaging in patients with aSAH. In this study, we explored whole brain activity patterns in patients with aSAH using amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF) and functional connectivity (FC).
   METHODS: Fifty patients with aSAH and 30 healthy controls were recruited and subjected to a resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging scan and cognitive tasks. Abnormalities of ALFF and FC in patients with aSAH and the correlations with cognitive tasks were assessed.
   RESULTS: The aSAH group exhibited increased ALFF mainly in the left parahippocampal gyrus (PHG), left inferior temporal gyrus (ITG), and left thalamus (THAL). FC and regression analysis showed positive correlations between functional connectivity strength (FCS) and memory performance in several connections in the aSAH group. These included (1) decreased FC between the left PHG and left inferior parietal lobe; (2) decreased FC between the left ITG and bilateral inferior frontal gyrus orbital part (ORBinf), right middle frontal gyrus; and (3) increased FC between the left THAL and right inferior frontal gyrus orbital part (ORBinf), and right inferior frontal gyrus opercular part.
   CONCLUSIONS: Our findings not only demonstrate the unique abnormal cerebral functional topology of patients with aSAH on both local and network levels, but also confirm the correlation between specific FCS and memory function in these patients. In addition, we have identified several potential imaging biomarkers for predicting cognitive outcomes in patients with aSAH.

AB OBJECTIVE: There is no standard way to define the angle of the tentorium. The current trend to use the Twining line to define this angle has significant pitfalls. The goal of the current study was to provide a new and accurate way to measure the tentorial angle and demonstrate its impact on surgeries of the pineal region.
   METHODS: A new technique (n-angle) to measure the tentorial angle was introduced using the floor of the fourth ventricle and the torcula. Comparisons with older techniques were made to illustrate reliability. Midline sagittal MR images were used to measure the tentorial angle in 240 individuals to obtain population-based data. A cohort of 8 patients who underwent either the infratentorial or the transtentorial approach to the pineal or upper vermian regionwere examined in search of correlations between tentorial angle and surgical approach.
   RESULTS: The data in this study showed that the Twining line technique understates the tentorial angle in people with low-lying torcula. The n-angle is more reliable in reflecting the true steepness of the tentorium regardless of torcula position. On average, men have slightly steeper tentoriums. In the clinical cohort, all patients who underwent infratentorial surgery had tentorial angles < 55 degrees, whereas the majority of patients who underwent transtentorial surgeries had angles > 67 degrees.
   CONCLUSION: The n-angle provides a reliable and accurate way to describe the slope of the tentorium. The population-based average of 60 degrees may be a useful measurement to influence the choice of surgical approach, either under or through the tentorium, to the pineal region.

AB OBJECTIVE: To present treatment strategies for spinal extradural arteriovenous fistulas (AVFs) in relation to angioarchitecture.
   METHODS: A retrospective analysis comprising 14 patients treated at 2 hospitals was performed.
   RESULTS: The 14 AVFs included 4 cervical, 1 thoracic, and 9 lumbosacral lesions. Three key angiographic features were observed: the feeding artery, an enlarged extradural venous plexus, and intradural retrograde venous drainage. In 3 patients (3 cervical AVFs) with compressive myelopathy owing to an enlarged venous plexus, the treatment goal was mass reduction of the venous plexus. Combined endovascular and microsurgical treatments may be curative for a large venous lake with multiple feeders. No intradural procedure was required because of the absence of intradural venous drainage. In contrast, in the other 11 patients (1 cervical, 1 thoracic, and 9 lumbosacral AVFs) with congestive myelopathy owing to intradural retrograde venous drainage, the goal of treatment was occlusion of the intradural proximal vein. Microsurgery or endovascular treatment may be curative by itself for a small venous pouch with a single intradural draining vein. Extradural procedures were not required in most patients treated by microsurgery because the extradural venous plexus was small. In all 14 patients, neurologic deficits improved or stabilized, and no recurrence was noted in the follow-up period (29 months).
   CONCLUSIONS: Spinal extradural AVFs consist of 2 subtypes-type A with intradural drainage and type B without intradural drainage-characterized by regional differences at each spinal level in angioarchitecture, causes of myelopathy, and treatment goals.

   SURGERY
AB BACKGROUND: Posterior communicating artery (PCoA) aneurysms are among the most common aneurysms. Because blockage of the PCoA and perforators can cause adverse outcomes, occlusion of these arteries by surgical clipping should be avoided. The impact of factors on PCoA perforator infarction when using a distal transsylvian approach for PCoA aneurysms was examined.
   METHODS: A total of 183 patients underwent PCoA aneurysm clipping, excluding application of fenestrated clips. Patients were divided into 2 groups: patients with PCoA perforator infarction (infarction group) and patients without infarction (noninfarction group). Multiple factors were analyzed in the 2 groups.
   RESULTS: Twenty-two of the 183 patients (12.0%) showed perforator infarction, mainly on magnetic resonance imaging evaluation, resulting in permanent deficits in 2 patients (1.1%). The proportion of right-sided operations (86.4% vs. 53.4%; P = 0.005) and surgery for rupture (90.9% vs. 55.9%; P = 0.002) were significantly higher in the infarction group than in the noninfarction group. Aneurysms were significantly larger in the infarction group (8.4 +/- 3.8 mm) than in the noninfarction group (6.3 +/- 3.0 mm; P = 0.02). Ruptured status (odds ratio [OR], 7.35; P = 0.01), right side (OR, 5.19; P = 0.01), and aneurysm size (OR, 1.18; P = 0.02) remained independent predictors of perforator infarction on multivariate logistic regression analysis.
   CONCLUSIONS: Ruptured status, right side, and large PCoA aneurysm were independent predictors of PCoA perforator infarction. Symptoms due to PCoA perforating infarction were mostly transient and rarely affected outcomes.

AB OBJECTIVE: Intracranial and intraspinal clear cell meningiomas (CCMs) are rarely reported because of their extremely low incidence, and the current understanding of CCM is poor. The purpose of this study was to analyze the incidence and the clinical, radiologic, pathologic, and prognostic features of intracranial and intraspinal CCMs.
   METHODS: Among 14,310 cases of intracranial and intraspinal meningiomas that were surgically treated between 2006 and 2016 at Beijing Tian Tan Hospital, 56 were chosen for analysis and retrospectively reviewed. To determine which parameters were associated with longer progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS), statistical analysis was performed.
   RESULTS: CCMs accounted for approximately 0.39% of all intracranial and intraspinal meningiomas. Patients with CCM had a mean age of 32.3 years and there was a female predilection (20 males and 36 females). Gross total resection was achieved in 35 cases, and subtotal resection was achieved in 21 cases. All patients were followed up for 10-206 months after surgery. Twenty-six patients experienced tumor recurrence, and the median PFS was 48.0 months. The 1-year, 3-year, and 5-year PFS was 87.5%, 59.8%, and 41.8%, respectively. Twelve patients died of tumor recurrence, and the median OS was not available. The 1-year, 3-year, and 5-year OS was 98.2%, 91.3%, and 65.8%, respectively. Univariate analysis showed that total tumor removal was significantly associated with a better prognosis. Multivariate analysis confirmed only Simpson grade III and IV resection as an independent risk factor for shorter PFS. Radiotherapy mildly improved PFS after both gross total resection and subtotal resection, showing no significant difference because of the small sample size and short follow-up duration.
   CONCLUSIONS: CCM is a rare subtype of World Health Organization grade II meningioma. CCM typically involves young patients and shows a female predilection and high recurrence rate. When possible, total resection is the primary and most suitable treatment for CCM. For patients with primary tumors, radiotherapy is recommended after the initial operation regardless of the extent of resection. For patients with disease recurrence, secondary surgery combined with radiotherapy might serve as an effective treatment.

   OUTCOMES
AB BACKGROUND: Pituitary apoplexy is an uncommon, potentially fatal condition due to spontaneous ischemia or hemorrhage in a pituitary adenoma. The treatment of this disorder has long been a matter of debate.
   METHODS: Retrospective cohort study including all patients admitted with pituitary apoplexy in our department between 2005 and 2015 was undertaken. Clinical symptoms and signs on admission, treatment (conservative vs. surgical), neurologic deficit on discharge and at 6 months' follow-up, and endocrinologic evaluation at 6 months' follow-up were analyzed. The statistical analysis was performed with STATA 13.0. Endocrinologic and visual outcomes at 6 months in the different groups according to treatment were compared by applying an independent multinomial probit regression test. Outcomes between the conservative and the surgical (endoscopic and microscopic considered together) groups also were compared and the differences between surgical treated groups were analyzed with logistic regression analysis. P values < 0.05 were considered significant.
   RESULTS: Twenty-three patients were included in this study; 60.9% (n = 14) were treated surgically (5 microsurgically; 9 endoscopically) and 39.1% (n = 9) conservatively. Statistical analysis revealed no significant differences in the visual function between the 3 treatment groups in both univariate and multivariate analysis (P > 0.05). The endocrinologic outcome was better in the surgical group (P = 0.017; adjusted P = 0.027), with a significant difference between the conservative group and the endoscopic group (P = 0.004; adjusted P = 0.005). When we compared both surgical groups, the endoscopic group has a better endocrinologic outcome (P = 0.020; adjusted P = 0.012).
   CONCLUSIONS: Our results support endoscopic intranasal transsphenoidal surgery as a treatment of pituitary apoplexy patients, as it probably decreases the need for long-term hormonal replacement.

AB OBJECTIVE: To prospectively compare the use of the cerebral blood flow monitor (c-FLOW) and transcranial Doppler (TCD) as 2 techniques for assessing brain perfusion during carotid endarterectomy.
   METHODS: This was a prospective, single-center, observational study. All patients were monitored using c-FLOW and TCD during the operation. Changes from baseline values of cerebral blood flow index and blood flow velocity of middle cerebral artery (V-MCA) were recorded following carotid artery clamping and unclamping. The correlation analysis was conducted for c-FLOW and TCD monitoring values.
   RESULTS: Seventy-three consecutive patients were enrolled from August 2015 to March 2016. No death or stroke occurred during the postoperative hospitalization. Fresh infarction was identified on magnetic resonance imaging in 17 patients. Ten patients showed a significant decrease of V-MCA following carotid clamping. A shunt was placed for only 4. The Pearson correlation index between CFI and V-MCA was 0.647 (P < 0.001). A cut-off of 21% decrease of CFI was proposed as optimal to detect intraoperative hypoperfusion. Seven patients were diagnosed as having hyperperfusion by TCD monitoring. The Pearson correlation index between CFI and V-MCA was 0.286 (P = 0.014). A cut-off of 15% increase of CFI following carotid unclamping was suggested as optimal to detect the postoperative hyperperfusion.
   CONCLUSIONS: c-FLOW could continuously and non-invasively monitor the cerebral blood flow in real-time during carotid endarterectomy and effectively detect the intraoperative hypoperfusion and postoperative hyperperfusion as defined by TCD so that it may serve as a favorable modality in future intraoperative monitoring.

AB OBJECTIVE: To investigate the imaging features on early postoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) after percutaneous endoscopic lumbar discectomy (PELD) and their correlations with surgical outcomes.
   METHODS: Forty-seven patients with lumbar disc herniation who underwent PELD were enrolled in this study. MRI scans were performed 1 week and 3 months after surgery. Imaging features on these MRI scans were evaluated. Clinical factors that might affect surgical outcomes were recorded. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to assess all potential factors affecting short-term and midterm outcomes after PELD.
   RESULTS: On MRI scans 1 week postoperatively, a residual mass at the operated site was observed in 93.6% of cases. Of those, ipsilateral nerve root compression was observed in 70.2% of cases. These residual masses had intermediate signal intensity on Tl-weighted images but either hyperintensity (56.8%) or intermediate intensity (43.2%) on T2-weighted images. On MRI scans 3 months postoperatively, the residual masses had vanished in 82.8% of cases. Based on the results of logistic regression analysis, symptom duration < 1 year (P = 0.033) and high T2 signal intensity of the residual mass (P = 0.004) correlated with better short-term outcomes. However, no factor was correlated with midterm outcomes.
   CONCLUSIONS: A residual mass with ipsilateral nerve root compression on early postoperative MRI after PELD is common. Most of these residual masses will vanish within 3 months. "Nerve root compressed by a residual mass" on early postoperative MRI does not affect surgical outcomes. "High T2 signal intensity of the residual mass" is associated with better short-term outcomes after PELD but not midterm outcomes.

AB BACKGROUND: Ependymomas are rare central nervous system tumors. Local tumor distribution in the central nervous system depends on age: among adults, ependymomas occur mostly in the spinal cord, whereas among children, intracranial manifestations are more common. To date, there are no prospective studies about treatment strategies for ependymomas. In most cases, complete tumor resection is recommended. The role of radiation therapy in low-grade ependymomas is unclear.
   METHODS: We report the results of 49 patients over an 18-year-period. Patients' clinical and radiologic data were analyzed retrospectively.
   RESULTS: Mean age of patients at time of surgery was 46.4 years. There were 29 women (59%) and 20 men (41%). Gross total resection was achieved in 72% of patients. Tumors affected cervical spinal cord in 14 patients (29%), cauda equina and filum terminale in 10 (21%), conus medullaris in 8 (16%), thoracic spinal cord in 7 (14%), and cervicolumbar or thoracolumbar junction in 10 (20%). Postoperative radiation therapy was performed in 6 cases. Long-term follow-up was available for 39 patients (mean 50.7 months). High preoperative McCormick grade correlated with high risk for clinical deterioration postoperatively. On long-term follow-up, clinical status was the same as preoperatively in 51% of patients, worse in 21%, and improved in 28%. We found no differences in progression-free survival with regard to histology. Four tumors relapsed after progression-free survival of a mean of 21 months.
   CONCLUSIONS: Gross total resection is considered the first choice in treatment of spinal ependymomas. The most important predictor of clinical outcome is preoperative neurologic functioning. The role of postoperative radiation needs further clarification.

AB BACKGROUND: Deep brain stimulation (DBS) has been introduced as a treatment option for treatment-resistant obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). However, the optimal stimulation target and the corresponding stimulation settings remain unclear. Furthermore, there is limited knowledge about the acute effects of DBS.
   METHODS: In 3 patients with treatment-resistant OCD, DBS electrodes were implanted in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST)/internal capsule (IC). On the next day, different electrode pairs (BNST only, IC only, and BNST/IC) were stimulated at different voltages (1, 2, and 3.5 V) for 5 minutes each. Afterwards, patients rated their perceived OCD symptoms and various emotional states on corresponding visual analog scales.
   RESULTS: Across locations, low voltage stimulation (1 and 2 V) was associated with reduction of OCD symptoms (i.e., anxiety and tension), in particular when the IC was stimulated. High voltage stimulation (3.5 V), in particular when BNST was involved, led to less reduction of OCD symptoms. Moreover, 3.5-V stimulation of the BNST (BNST only and BNST/IC) induced higher levels of anxiety, tension, and discomfort. Subjects also reported an increase in vegetative sensations.
   CONCLUSIONS: In summary, we demonstrate that both stimulation site and voltage settings show sweet spots (2 V at IC or BNST/IC) at which OCD symptom severity decreased while negative effects were minimal. Stimulation of IC fibers might be relevant both for acute and chronic effects. Whether acute effects are useful for outcome prediction remains to be shown in future studies.

ID COMPUTED-TOMOGRAPHY; BRAIN-INJURY; 3D SLICER; SUBARACHNOID HEMORRHAGE;
   PROGNOSTIC-FACTORS; MIDLINE SHIFT; MANAGEMENT; SCAN
AB OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether subdural hematoma (SDH) volume and other radiologic factors predict deterioration of mental status in patients with acute traumatic SDH.
   METHODS: SDH volumes were measured with a semi-automated tool. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was used to determine optimal cutoff values for mental deterioration, including the variables midline shift, SDH volume, hematoma thickness, and Sylvian fissure ratio. Multivariate logistic regression was used to calculate the odds ratio for mental deterioration based on several predictive factors.
   RESULTS: We enrolled 103 consecutive patients admitted to our hospital with acute traumatic SDH over an 8-year period. We observed an increase in SDH volume of approximately 7.2 mL as SDH thickness increased by 1 mm. A steeper slope for midline shift was observed in patients with SDH volumes of approximately 75 mL in the younger age group compared with patients in the older age group. When comparing cutoff values used to predict poor mental status at time of admission between the 2 age groups, we observed smaller midline shifts in the older patients.
   CONCLUSIONS: Among younger patients, an overall tendency for more rapid midline shift progression was observed in patients with relatively low SDH volumes compared with older patients. Older patients seem to tolerate larger hematoma volumes owing to brain atrophy compared with younger patients. When there is a midline shift, older patients seem to be more vulnerable to mental deterioration than younger patients.

DE Meningioma; Quality of life; Symptoms
ID GRADE I; BRAIN-TUMORS; SEIZURES; SURGERY
AB BACKGROUND: Meningioma is the most common primary intracranial tumor and patients present with diverse neurologic symptoms related to meningioma location. This study aimed to systematically quantify the presenting symptoms of meningioma and identify prognostic factors for symptomatic outcome following resection.
   METHODS: Two-hundred and eighty-three patients who underwent resection of a total of 313 meningiomas at a single institution were retrospectively identified, including 161 World Health Organization grade I (52.6%), 108 grade II (35.5%), and 37 grade III meningiomas (12.1%). Patient-reported symptoms were extracted from the medical record and dichotomized into acute (<3 months) and long-term (3-12 months) categories. The chi(2) test and multivariate regression were used to compare groups.
   RESULTS: Patients presented primarily with headaches (48.2%) and either cerebral dysfunctions (48.5%) with convexity meningiomas or cranial nerve deficits (38.9%) with skull base meningiomas. Symptomatic improvement in the acute postoperative period was significantly correlated with long term symptomatic improvement (P <= 0.01). Headaches and seizures had the greatest rates of symptomatic improvement after surgery (78%), and the vast majority of patients with symptom improvement experienced complete resolution (86%). In contrast, symptoms persisted in >60% of patients with anosmia, sensory changes, or frontal, temporal, or cerebellar symptoms. Multivariate regression identified subtotal resection as a prognostic factor for persistent symptoms (odds ratio, 0.62; 95% confidence interval, 0.03-1.21; P = 0.041).
   CONCLUSIONS: Symptoms improve in the majority of patients after resection of meningioma, with the rate of improvement varying according to symptom type and extent of resection. These data may be a useful when counseling patients about symptoms after resection of meningiomas.

DT Article
DE Facial bones; Fractures; Glasgow Outcome Scale; Traumatic brain injuries
ID HEAD-INJURY; SCALE
AB BACKGROUND: Facial fractures frequently occur with traumatic brain injury (TBI). The relationship between facial fractures and brain trauma remains controversial. The objective of this study was to analyze the correlation between facial fracture and TBI.
   METHODS: Clinical and radiologic data of a total of 206 patients were retrospectively collected from May 2011 to December 2015 in a single institute. Facial fracture was classified by the Facial Injury Severity Scale (FISS). TBI was grouped according to the Glasgow Coma Scale. Outcome was measured with the Glasgow Outcome Scale Extended 3, 6, and 12 months after trauma. -
   RESULTS: There were 206 TBI patients with concomitant facial fracture including 166 (8.1%) males and 40 (19.4%) females. Mean age of all patients was 46 +/- 19 years. Contusion and brain swelling were more frequent in higher FISS patients. Cranial surgery was done in 63 cases while facial fracture surgery was performed in 89 cases. There were 33 expired cases, including 6 cases due to multi-organ failure. High FISS was significantly associated with severe TBI and less favorable outcome 3 months after trauma. Concomitant surgical treatment for TBI and facial fracture was done in 21 cases without achieving more improved outcome compared with staged operations for 41 cases.
   CONCLUSION: Severity of facial fracture might be correlated with severity of TBI. Surgical timing of facial fracture with TBI patients does not affect the outcome of TBI.

AB OBJECTIVE: To observe effects of rosiglitazone (RSG) infusion therapy on perihematomal peroxisome-proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR gamma), glutamate, blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability, and brain edema.
   METHODS: Fifty male rabbits (2.8-3.4 kg) were randomly assigned to a normal control (NC) group, model control (MC) group, RSG group, minimally invasive surgery (MIS) group, or MIS and RSG (MIS+RSG) group. Intracranial hemorrhage was induced in all rabbits except for the NC group. MIS procedures were performed to evacuate the intracranial hemorrhage 6 hours after the intracranial hemorrhage model was prepared successfully. The animals were sacrificed on day 7, and the perihematomal brain tissue was obtained to determine PPAR gamma, glutamate, and BBB permeability.
   RESULTS: Compared with the MC group, the MIS group displayed a remarkable decrease in PPAR gamma, glutamate, and BBB permeability. The RSG group showed similar results in glutamate level and BBB permeability but a significant increase in PPAR gamma. The MIS+RSG group displayed an increase in PPAR gamma and a more significant decrease in glutamate, BBB permeability, and neurologicl deficit scores compared with the other groups.
   CONCLUSIONS: Performing MIS followed by RSG infusion therapy might increase PPAR gamma expression and might be more efficacious for reducing glutamate level and BBB permeability and improving neurologic function than MIS or RSG therapy used alone.

AB OBJECTIVE: To compare the efficacy and complications of microvascular decompression (MVD) by complete neuroendoscopy versus microscopy for 213 cases of trigeminal neuralgia (TN).
   METHODS: Between January 2014 and January 2016, 213 patients with TN were randomly assigned to the neuroendoscopy (n = 105) or microscopy (n = 114) group for MVD via the suboccipital retrosigmoid approach. All procedures were performed by the same neurosurgeon. Follow-up was conducted by telephone interview. Statistical data were analyzed with the chi-square test, and a probability (P) value of <= 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Chi-square test was conducted using SAS 9.4 software (SAS Institute, Cary, North Carolina, USA).
   RESULTS: There were no statistical differences between the 2 groups in pain-free condition immediately post procedure, pain-free condition 1 year post procedure, hearing loss, facial hypoesthesia, transient ataxia, aseptic meningitis, intracranial infections, and herpetic lesions of the lips. There were no instances of death, facial paralysis, cerebral hemorrhage, or cerebrospinal fluid leakage in either group.
   CONCLUSIONS: There were no significant differences in the cure rates or incidences of surgical complications between neuroendoscopic and microscopic MVD.

TI Survival of Ventricular and Periventricular High-Grade Gliomas: A
   Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Programe-Based Study

AB BACKGROUND: Aggressiveness of surgical resection for periventricular/ventricular high-grade gliomas (HGGs) is determined by operative risks and assumed effectiveness of radiation therapy (RT) on residual tumor. We aimed to clarify the impact of surgery and postoperative RT on patient survival in a population-based study.
   METHODS: This population-based study used the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database. Patients with ventricular malignant tumors were screened for HGGs. In accordance with the World Health Organization (WHO) 2016 classification, we included cases with "diffuse astrocytic and oligodendroglial tumors," "other astrocytic tumors," " ependymal tumors," and " other gliomas". Tumor grading followed definitions established by the WHO with supplementation from SEER classifications. Only grades III and IV were included. Individual factors were assessed by hazard ratio (HR) from multivariable survival analysis using accelerated failure time (AFT) regression.
   RESULTS: We included 353 patients after application of inclusion and exclusion criteria. The mean patient age was 38.77 +/- 24.95 years, and the cohort was 61.5% male. Overall median survival was 12 months, with notable improvement over the last 3 decades. In a multivariate AFT model, older age (per 10-year increase, HR, 1.19; P < 0.001) was the sole nontreatment variable found to predict survival, whereas postoperative RT had a significant survival benefit (HR, 0.50; P < 0.001). No tumor characteristic (e.g., size, extent of invasion) predicted prognosis. Interestingly, neither partial resection nor TR/GTR was associated with improved outcome.
   CONCLUSIONS: The prognosis of ventricular HGGs is poor, with worse prognosis in older patients. We found no evidence to support aggressive surgical resection. Postoperative chemoradiation should be administered; however, the benefit of modification of the protocol for chemoradiation specifically for ventricular HGGs remains unknown and warrants further investigation.

TI Salvage Anterior Lumbar Interbody Fusion for Pseudoarthrosis After
   Posterior or Transforaminal Lumbar Interbody Fusion: A Review of 10
   Patients
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
LA English
DT Review
DE Anterior lumbar interbody fusion; Pseudoarthrosis; Salvage procedure
ID SURGERY; SPINE; DECOMPRESSION
AB BACKGROUND: After interbody cage implantation for posterior or transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion (PLIF or TLIF) spinal fusion surgery, pseudoarthrosis can develop. However, there are several shortcomings of the posterior approach if the interbody cage requires removal. Therefore, an anterior approach may be useful.
   METHODS: We reviewed salvage anterior lumbar interbody fusion (ALIF) for pseudoarthrosis after PLIF or TLIF performed from December 2006 to December 2016. A total of 10 patients met inclusion criteria for the study. All preoperative and postoperative clinical and radiologic parameters were recorded.
   RESULTS: Salvage ALIF resulted in improvements in clinical and radiologic outcomes in all cases. In 9 cases, the previously inserted cage was successfully removed. In 1 case, only 1 of the 2 previously inserted cages could be removed, as the previously inserted cage exhibited a high subsidence and remained in a diagonal position in the vertebral body. No serious complications occurred in all cases. Bone fusion was successful in all cases.
   CONCLUSIONS: ALIF is useful for salvage surgery to treat failed PLIF or TLIF. The advantages of salvage ALIF include improvements in clinical and radiologic outcomes and a low complication rate after surgery. To successfully remove a previously inserted cage, the vascular window of the anterior index level and the degree of subsidence of the cage should be well characterized through preoperative radiologic imaging.

AB OBJECTIVE: To evaluate transduction efficacy and sustainability of lentiviral vector for intervertebral disc cells both in vitro and in vivo.
   METHODS: Human nuclear pulposus and anulus fibrosus cells isolated from disc tissue of 28 patients during surgical disc procedures were cultured and subsequently transduced using recombinant lentivirus carrying a gene for enhanced green fluorescent protein at multiplicities of infection of 0, 15, 30, 60, 90, and 150. Cell viability was determined using the trypan blue exclusion test. Transduction efficiency was measured by fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis. In vivo experiments were done by injecting lentivirus into rat intervertebral discs. Disc tissue was harvested 7, 14, 21, and 28 days after transduction, and enhanced green fluorescent protein expression was examined using an inverted fluorescent microscope.
   RESULTS: Intervertebral disc cells transduced with different doses of lentivirus showed equally good viabilities compared with cells in the control group, as determined by cell morphology and growth curves after transduction. The transduction ratio for disc cells after transduction reached its optimum of 97% at 60 multiplicities of infection, independent of patient age, sex, surgical procedure, diagnosis, disc level, or degeneration grade. In vivo frozen sections revealed that enhanced green fluorescent protein expression peaked on the 7th day and remained detectable the 28th day after transduction. No significant systemic symptoms were observed during the in vivo experiment.
   CONCLUSIONS: Lentivirus appears to be an efficient and stable transduction vector for intervertebral disc cells. It has potential as a gene therapy tool for treating human degenerative disc disease.

AB BACKGROUND: A porous additive manufactured (AM) cage may provide stability similar to that of traditional solid cages and may be beneficial to bone ingrowth. The biomechanical influence of various porous cages on stability, subsidence, stresses in cage, and facet contact force has not been fully described. The purpose of this study was to verify biomechanical effects of porous AM cages.
   METHODS: The surgical finite element models with various cages were constructed. The partially porous titanium (PPT) cages and fully porous titanium (FPT) cages were applied. The mechanical parameters of porous materials were obtained by mechanical test. Then the porous AM cages were compared with solid titanium (TI) cage and solid polyetheretherketone (PEEK) cage. The 4 motion modes were simulated. Range of motion (ROM), cage stress, end plate stress, and facet joint force (FJF) were compared.
   RESULTS: For all the surgical models, ROM decreased by >90%. Compared with TI and PPT cages, PEEK and FPT cages substantially reduced the maximum stresses in cage and end plate in all motion modes. Compared with PEEK cages, the stresses in cage and end plate for FPT cages decreased, whereas the ROM increased. Comparing FPT cages, the stresses in cage and end plate decreased with increasing porosity, whereas ROM increased with increasing porosity. After interbody fusion, FJF was substantially reduced in all motion modes except for flexion.
   CONCLUSIONS: Fully porous cages may offer an alternative to solid PEEK cages in lateral lumbar interbody fusion. However, it may be prudent to further increase the porosity of the cage.

AB OBJECTIVE: Transnasal endoscopic skull base surgery (SBS) presents a major challenge for inexperienced neurosurgeons because of the complicated anatomic structures, 2-dimensional endoscopic view, limited operative field, and required skills. We designed a personalized multimaterial and multicolor three-dimensional (3D)printed SBS simulation to reproduce the complex anatomy of the skull base. The fidelity and feasibility for anatomic education and surgical training were assessed.
   METHODS: Two-dimensional computer tomography and magnetic resonance images were collected from a 42-year-old healthy male volunteer. After 3D modeling and spatial alignment, personalized SBS simulations were produced using a multimaterial 3D printer. The fidelity of the models was assessed by 3 experienced neurosurgeons, and the effects for anatomic education and surgical training were evaluated by 10 resident trainees. Both evaluations were based on 5-point Likert questionnaires.
   RESULTS: The mean scores for fidelity of tissue structure ranged from 3.7 to 4.7, and scores for aid in anatomic education and surgical training ranged from 3.5 to 4.9.
   CONCLUSION: The 3D-printed SBS simulation is a practical, economical, high-fidelity model. It has great potential for anatomic education and operative training in transnasal endoscopic surgery.

ID NATURAL-HISTORY; HEMORRHAGE RISK; BRAIN; MANAGEMENT
AB OBJECTIVE: Whether rupture risk of cerebral arteriovenous malformation (AVM) is higher during pregnancy and puerperium remains controversial. This study aimed to compare risk of rupture in pregnant and nonpregnant female patients with AVM in a singer-center series and assess current evidence regarding rupture risk of AVM during pregnancy and puerperium by pooled data analysis.
   METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed female patients with AVM in our center from January 2006 to August 2017. Hemorrhage events and patient-years were calculated during exposure period and nonexposure period, which was defined as either the interval from birth until AVM obliteration or last follow-up after subtracting the exposure period. Poisson rate ratio analysis was used to compare hemorrhage rate between the 2 periods. Pooled data analysis was performed by up-to-date literature review via PubMed and EMBASE databases.
   RESULTS: In 264 female patients with AVM, overall annual hemorrhage rate for 222 total hemorrhages during an average of 7484 patient-years was 2.97%. Eight hemorrhages occurred in exposure periods, 214 hemorrhages occurred in nonexposure periods, and 155 hemorrhages occurred in nonexposure periods of reproductive-age patients, translating to annual hemorrhage rates of 5.40% in exposure periods, 2.92% in nonexposure periods, and 3.82% in nonexposure periods of reproductive-age patients. Pooled data analysis showed a higher annual hemorrhage rate in exposure periods than in nonexposure periods (5.59% vs. 2.52%; 95% confidence interval 1.52e6.70, P = 0.002).
   CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated an increase in annual rate of cerebral AVM hemorrhage during pregnancy and puerperium. Female reproductive-age patients with cerebral AVM may have higher risks of AVM rupture. Further evaluation by well-designed prospective or randomized cohort studies is needed.

TI A shared latent space matrix factorisation method for recommending new

SO JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL INFORMATICS

DT Review
DE Systematic reviews; Clinical trials; Information retrieval; Matrix
   factorisation
ID CLINICAL-TRIALS; WORKLOAD; FEATURES; SEARCH
AB Background: Clinical trial registries can be used to monitor the production of trial evidence and signal when systematic reviews become out of date. However, this use has been limited to date due to the extensive manual review required to search for and screen relevant trial registrations. Our aim was to evaluate a new method that could partially automate the identification of trial registrations that may be relevant for systematic review updates.
   Materials and methods: We identified 179 systematic reviews of drug interventions for type 2 diabetes, which included 537 clinical trials that had registrations in ClinicalTrials.gov. Text from the trial registrations were used as features directly, or transformed using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) or Principal Component Analysis (PCA). We tested a novel matrix factorisation approach that uses a shared latent space to learn how to rank relevant trial registrations for each systematic review, comparing the performance to document similarity to rank relevant trial registrations. The two approaches were tested on a holdout set of the newest trials from the set of type 2 diabetes systematic reviews and an unseen set of 141 clinical trial registrations from 17 updated systematic reviews published in the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews. The performance was measured by the number of relevant registrations found after examining 100 candidates (recall@100) and the median rank of relevant registrations in the ranked candidate lists.
   Results: The matrix factorisation approach outperformed the document similarity approach with a median rank of 59 (of 128,392 candidate registrations in ClinicalTrials.gov) and recall@100 of 60.9% using LDA feature representation, compared to a median rank of 138 and recall@100 of 42.8% in the document similarity baseline. In the second set of systematic reviews and their updates, the highest performing approach used document similarity and gave a median rank of 67 (recall@100 of 62.9%).
   Conclusions: A shared latent space matrix factorisation method was useful for ranking trial registrations to reduce the manual workload associated with finding relevant trials for systematic review updates. The results suggest that the approach could be used as part of a semi-automated pipeline for monitoring potentially new evidence for inclusion in a review update.

AB Objective: Data quality assessment is a challenging facet for research using coded administrative health data. Current assessment approaches are time and resource intensive. We explored whether association rule mining (ARM) can be used to develop rules for assessing data quality.
   Materials and methods: We extracted 2013 and 2014 records from the hospital discharge abstract database (DAD) for patients between the ages of 55 and 65 from five acute care hospitals in Alberta, Canada. The ARM was conducted using the 2013 DAD to extract rules with support >= 0.0019 and confidence >= 0.5 using the bootstrap technique, and tested in the 2014 DAD. The rules were compared against the method of coding frequency and assessed for their ability to detect error introduced by two kinds of data manipulation: random permutation and random deletion.
   Results: The association rules generally had clear clinical meanings. Comparing 2014 data to 2013 data (both original), there were 3 rules with a confidence difference > 0.1, while coding frequency difference of codes in the right hand of rules was less than 0.004. After random permutation of 50% of codes in the 2014 data, average rule confidence dropped from 0.72 to 0.27 while coding frequency remained unchanged. Rule confidence decreased with the increase of coding deletion, as expected. Rule confidence was more sensitive to code deletion compared to coding frequency, with slope of change ranging from 1.7 to 184.9 with a median of 9.1.
   Conclusion: The ARM is a promising technique to assess data quality. It offers a systematic way to derive coding association rules hidden in data, and potentially provides a sensitive and efficient method of assessing data quality compared to standard methods.

TI A standard-driven approach for electronic submission to pharmaceutical
   regulatory authorities
SO JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL INFORMATICS
LA English
DT Article
DE Annotated case report form; CDISC standards; Electronic regulatory
   submission
ID CLINICAL-RESEARCH; CHALLENGES
AB Objective: Using standards is not only useful for data interchange during the process of a clinical trial, but also useful for analyzing data in a review process. Any step, which speeds up approval of new drugs, may benefit patients. As a result, adopting standards for regulatory submission becomes mandatory in some countries. However, preparing standard-compliant documents, such as annotated case report form (aCRF), needs a great deal of knowledge and experience. The process is complex and labor-intensive. Therefore, there is a need to use information technology to facilitate this process.
   Materials and methods: Instead of standardizing data after the completion of a clinical trial, this study proposed a standard-driven approach. This approach was achieved by implementing a computer-assisted "standard-driven pipeline (SDP)" in an existing clinical data management system. SDP used CDISC standards to drive all processes of a clinical trial, such as the design, data acquisition, tabulation, etc.
   Results: A completed phase I/II trial was used to prove the concept and to evaluate the effects of this approach. By using the CDISC-compliant question library, aCRFs were generated automatically when the eCRFs were completed. For comparison purpose, the data collection process was simulated and the collected data was transformed by the SDP. This new approach reduced the missing data fields from sixty-two to eight and the controlled term mismatch field reduced from eight to zero during data tabulation.
   Conclusion: This standard-driven approach accelerated CRF annotation and assured data tabulation integrity. The benefits of this approach include an improvement in the use of standards during the clinical trial and a reduction in missing and unexpected data during tabulation. The standard-driven approach is an advanced design idea that can be used for future clinical information system development.

TI Archetype modeling methodology
SO JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL INFORMATICS
LA English
DT Article
DE Archetype; Methodology; Dual model; ISO 13606; Openehr
AB Clinical Information Models (CIMs) expressed as archetypes play an essential role in the design and development of current Electronic Health Record (EHR) information structures. Although there exist many experiences about using archetypes in the literature, a comprehensive and formal methodology for archetype modeling does not exist. Having a modeling methodology is essential to develop quality archetypes, in order to guide the development of EHR systems and to allow the semantic interoperability of health data. In this work, an archetype modeling methodology is proposed. This paper describes its phases, the inputs and outputs of each phase, and the involved participants and tools. It also includes the description of the possible strategies to organize the modeling process. The proposed methodology is inspired by existing best practices of CIMs, software and ontology development. The methodology has been applied and evaluated in regional and national EHR projects. The application of the methodology provided useful feedback and improvements, and confirmed its advantages. The conclusion of this work is that having a formal methodology for archetype development facilitates the definition and adoption of interoperable archetypes, improves their quality, and facilitates their reuse among different information systems and EHR projects. Moreover, the proposed methodology can be also a reference for CIMs development using any other formalism.

AB Background: Control systems engineering methods, particularly, system identification (system ID), offer an idiographic (i.e., person-specific) approach to develop dynamic models of physical activity (PA) that can be used to personalize interventions in a systematic, scalable way. The purpose of this work is to: (1) apply system ID to develop individual dynamical models of PA (steps/day measured using Fitbit Zip) in the context of a goal setting and positive reinforcement intervention informed by Social Cognitive Theory; and (2) compare insights on potential tailoring variables (i.e., predictors expected to influence steps and thus moderate the suggested step goal and points for goal achievement) selected using the idiographic models to those selected via a nomothetic (i.e., aggregated across individuals) approach.
   Method: A personalized goal setting and positive reinforcement intervention was deployed for 14 weeks. Baseline PA measured in weeks 1-2 was used to inform personalized daily step goals delivered in weeks 3-14. Goals and expected reward points (granted upon goal achievement) were pseudo-randomly assigned using techniques from system ID, with goals ranging from their baseline median steps/day up to 2.5 x baseline median steps/day, and points ranging from 100 to 500 (i.e., $0.20-$1.00). Participants completed a series of daily self report measures. Auto Regressive with eXogenous Input (ARX) modeling and multilevel modeling (MLM) were used as the idiographic and nomothetic approaches, respectively.
   Results: Participants (N = 20, mean age = 47.25 +/- 6.16 years, 90% female) were insufficiently active, overweight (mean BMI = 33.79 +/- 6.82 kg/m(2)) adults. Results from ARX modeling suggest that individuals differ in the factors (e.g., perceived stress, weekday/weekend) that influence their observed steps/day. In contrast, the nomothetic model from MLM suggested that goals and weekday/weekend were the key variables that were predictive of steps. Assuming the ARX models are more personalized, the obtained nomothetic model would have led to the identification of the same predictors for 5 of the 20 participants, suggesting a mismatch of plausible tailoring variables to use for 75% of the sample.
   Conclusion: The idiographic approach revealed person-specific predictors beyond traditional MLM analyses and unpacked the inherent complexity of PA; namely that people are different and context matters. System ID provides a feasible approach to develop personalized dynamical models of PA and inform person-specific tailoring variable selection for use in adaptive behavioral interventions.

AB Data from traditional public health surveillance systems can have some limitations, e.g., timeliness, geographic level, and amount of data accessible. Electronic health records (EHRs) could present an opportunity to supplement current sources of routinely collected surveillance data. The National Environmental Public Health Tracking Program (Tracking Program) sought to explore the use of EHRs for advancing environmental public health surveillance practices. The Tracking Program funded four state/local health departments to obtain and pilot the use of EHR data to address several issues including the challenges and technical requirements for accessing EHR data, and the core data elements required to integrate EHR data within their departments' Tracking Programs. The results of these pilot projects highlighted the potential of EHR data for public health surveillance of rare diseases that may lack comprehensive registries, and surveillance of prevalent health conditions or risk factors for health outcomes at a finer geographic level. EHRs therefore, may have potential to supplement traditional sources of public health surveillance data.

AB Pulse diagnosis is an efficient method in traditional Chinese medicine for detecting the health status of a person in a non-invasive and convenient way. Jin's pulse diagnosis (JPD) is a very efficient recent development that is gradually recognized and well validated by the medical community in recent years. However, no acceptable results have been achieved for lung cancer recognition in the field of biomedical signal processing using JPD. More so, there is no standard JPD pulse feature defined with respect to pulse signals. Our work is designed mainly for care giving service conveniently at home to the people having lung cancer by proposing a novel wrist pulse signal processing method, having an insight from JPD. We developed an iterative slide window (ISW) algorithm to segment the de-noised signal into single periods. We analyzed the characteristics of the segmented pulse waveform and for the first time summarized 26 features to classify the pulse waveforms of healthy individuals and lung cancer patients using a cubic support vector machine (CSVM). The result achieved by the proposed method is found to be 78.13% accurate.

AB Most health technologies are designed to support people who have already decided to work toward better health. Thus, there remains an opportunity to design technologies to help motivate people who have not yet decided to make a change. Understanding the experiences of people who have already started to make a health behavior change and how they made a pivotal decision can be useful in understanding how to design such tools. In this paper, we describe results from data collected in 2 phases. Phase 1 consisted of 127 surveys and 13 interviews with adults who have already accomplished behavior change(s). Phase 2 consisted of 117 surveys and 12 interviews with adults who have either already accomplished their behavior change(s) or are currently working toward them. We identified four factors that lead to pivotal experiences: (1) prolonged discontent and desire to change, (2) significant changes that increase fear or hope of future, (3) increased understanding of one's behavior and personal data, and (4) social accountability. We also describe a design space for designing technology-based interventions for encouraging people to decide to make a change to improve their health. Based on feedback from participants, we discuss opportunities for further exploration of the design space for people who are not yet motivated to change and for ethical considerations for this type of intervention.

AB Cosmic-ray neutron probes (CRNPs) have footprint radii for measuring soil-water content (SWC). The theoretical radius is much larger at high altitude, such as the northern Tibetan Plateau, than the radius at sea level. The most probable practical radius of CRNPs for the northern Tibetan Plateau, however, is not known due to the lack of SWC data in this hostile environment. We calculated the theoretical footprint of the CRNP based on a recent simulation and analyzed the practical radius of a CRNP for the northern Tibetan Plateau by measuring SWC at 113 sampling locations on 21 measuring occasions to a depth of 30 cm in a 33.5 ha plot in an alpine meadow at 4600 m a.s.l. The temporal variability and spatial heterogeneity of SWC within the footprint were then analyzed. The theoretical footprint radius was between 360 and 420 m after accounting for the influences of air humidity, soil moisture, vegetation and air pressure. A comparison of SWCs measured by the CRNP and a neutron probe from access tubes in circles with different radii conservatively indicated that the most probable experimental footprint radius was >200 m. SWC within the CRNP footprint was moderately variable over both time and space, but the temporal variability was higher. Spatial heterogeneity was weak, but should be considered in future CRNP calibrations. This study provided theoretical and practical bases for the application and promotion of CRNPs in alpine meadows on the Tibetan Plateau. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Climate change impact assessment on meteorological variables involves large uncertainties as a result of incomplete knowledge on the future greenhouse gas concentrations and climate model physics, next to the inherent internal variability of the climate system. Given that the alteration in greenhouse gas concentrations is the driver for the change, one expects the impacts to be highly dependent on the considered greenhouse gas scenario (GHS). In this study, we denote this behavior as GHS sensitivity. Due to the climate model related uncertainties, this sensitivity is, at local scale, not always that strong as expected. This paper aims to study the GHS sensitivity and its contributing role to climate scenarios for a case study in Belgium. An ensemble of 160 CMIP5 climate model runs is considered and climate change signals are studied for precipitation accumulation, daily precipitation intensities and wet day frequencies. This was done for the different seasons of the year and the scenario periods 2011-2040, 2031-2060,2051-2081 and 2071-2100. By means of variance decomposition, the total variance in the climate change signals was separated in the contribution of the differences in GHSs and the other model-related uncertainty sources. These contributions were found dependent on the variable and season. Following the time of emergence concept, the GHS uncertainty contribution is found dependent on the time horizon and increases over time. For the most distinct time horizon (2071-2100), the climate model uncertainty accounts for the largest uncertainty contribution. The GHS differences explain up to 18% of the total variance in the climate change signals. The results point further at the importance of the climate model ensemble design, specifically the ensemble size and the combination of climate models, whereupon climate scenarios are based.
   The numerical noise, introduced at scales smaller than the skillful scale, e.g. at local scale, was not considered in this study. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Shallow sediment core samples from two locales in the Mesopotamian marshlands of Iraq were analyzed to characterize the extractable organic (lipid) compounds, and their sources and distributions after hydrological restoration by re-flooding of the marshes. Dried samples were extracted with a dichloro-methane/methanol mixture before analysis by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The major compounds were (n) under bar -alkanes, fatty acids and alcohols, steroids, terpenoids, hopanes, steranes, unresolved complex mixture (UCM), and plasticizers. The lipid compounds in Kurmashia (Al-Hammar marshes) were generally higher in concentration than in Abu Zirig (Central marshes), and decreased with core depths for both sites. This concentration decrease with core depth is attributed to transformation, biodegradation and variable input processes. The distribution patterns of the lipids in the sediment cores indicated that the Abu Zirig area was drier than Kurmashia before the re-flooding process. Furthermore, the concentration of the compounds in the surface sediment the Abu Zirig core was as high and similar to that in Kurmashia, reflecting the re-flooding impacts on the marsh and the revival of the wetland. The major sources of these lipids were from natural terrestrial vegetation (35-66% for Abu Zirig; 40-49% for Kurmashia), microbial (plankton) residues and bacteria (27-52% for Abu Zirig; 39-43% for Kurmashia), with a minor contribution from anthropogenic sources including plastic wastes and petroleum (6-13% for Abu Zirig; 9-18% for Kurmashia).

AB Rainfall partitioning is an important part of the ecohydrological cycle, influenced by numerous variables. Rainfall partitioning for pine (Pinus nigra Arnold) and birch (Betula pendula Roth.) trees was measured from January 2014 to June 2017 in an urban area of Ljubljana, Slovenia. 180 events from more than three years of observations were analyzed, focusing on 13 meteorological variables, including the number of raindrops, their diameter, and velocity. Regression tree and boosted regression tree analyses were performed to evaluate the influence of the variables on rainfall interception loss, throughfall, and stemflow in different phenoseasons. The amount of rainfall was recognized as the most influential variable, followed by rainfall intensity and the number of raindrops. Higher rainfall amount, intensity, and the number of drops decreased percentage of rainfall interception loss. Rainfall amount and intensity were the most influential on interception loss by birch and pine trees during the leafed and leafless periods, respectively. Lower wind speed was found to increase throughfall, whereas wind direction had no significant influence. Consideration of drop size spectrum properties proved to be important, since the number of drops, drop diameter, and median volume diameter were often recognized as important influential variables.

AB Southwest China, as one of the largest continuous karst areas in the world, is a severely eroded region due to its special geological condition. Thus, soil and water conservation measures such as dam construction have been extensively implemented in this region to control sediment delivery. However, it remains unclear how dam construction affects multiscale variability of sediment discharge (SD) and its potentially influential factors in southwest China. To assess this, annual SD, water discharge (WD), precipitation (PT), potential evapotranspiration (PET), and normalized differential vegetation index (NDVI) data from 1955 to 2015 were obtained from two karst watersheds of Liujiang (no large dams) and Hongshui (dam controlled). These sites shared the similar climatic conditions. The Mann-Kendal test, Wilcoxon rank sum test, and continuous wavelet transform analysis was used to detect the trends and periodicity in SD, and wavelet coherence analysis were employed to detect the temporal covariance between SD and WD, PT, PET, and NDVI. Results indicated that the multiscale variability of SD was strongly influenced by dam construction. The annual SD showed significant 4-year periodic oscillation in the Liujiang watershed, while no significant cycles were found in the Hongshui watershed. Dam construction exerted substantial influence on the multiscale correlations between SD and its associated factors. The time scales that the NDVI resonated with SD were concentrated on the periodicity of 2- and 3-year in the Liujiang watershed. In contrast, no significant periodicities were observed in the Hongshu watershed. This study yields a greater understanding of SD dynamics, and is helpful for better watershed management in karst areas of southwest China. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A test using Rhodamine WT and heat as tracers, conducted over a 78 day period in a strongly heterogeneous alluvial aquifer, was used to evaluate the utility of the combined observation dataset for aquifer characterization. A highly parameterized model was inverted, with concentration and temperature time-series as calibration targets. Groundwater heads recorded during the experiment were boundary dependent and were ignored during the inversion process. The inverted model produced a high resolution depiction of the hydraulic conductivity and porosity fields. Statistical properties of these fields are in very good agreement with estimates from previous studies at the site. Spatially distributed sensitivity analysis suggests that both solute and heat transport were most sensitive to the hydraulic conductivity and porosity fields and less sensitive to dispersivity and thermal distribution factor, with sensitivity to porosity greatly reducing outside the monitored area. The issues of model over-parameterization and non-uniqueness are addressed through identifiability analysis. Longitudinal dispersivity and thermal distribution factor are highly identifiable, however spatially distributed parameters are only identifiable near the injection point. Temperature related density effects became observable for both heat and solute, as the temperature anomaly increased above 12 degrees centigrade, and affected down gradient propagation. Finally we demonstrate that high frequency and spatially dense temperature data cannot inform a dual porosity model in the absence of frequent solute concentration measurements.

AB Streams and rivers emit significant amounts of CO2 and constitute a preferential pathway of carbon transport from terrestrial ecosystems to the atmosphere. However, the estimation of CO2 degassing based on the water-air CO2 gradient, gas transfer velocity and stream surface area is subject to large uncertainties. Furthermore, the stable isotope signature of dissolved inorganic carbon (delta C-13-DIC) in streams is strongly impacted by gas exchange, which makes it a useful tracer of CO2 degassing under specific conditions. For this study, we characterized the annual transfers of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) along the groundwater-stream-river continuum based on DIC concentrations, stable isotope composition and measurements of stream discharges. We selected a homogeneous, forested and sandy lowland watershed as a study site, where the hydrology occurs almost exclusively through drainage of shallow groundwater (no surface runoff). We observed the first general spatial pattern of decreases in pCO(2) and DIC and an increase in delta C-13-DIC from groundwater to stream orders 1 and 2, which was due to the experimentally verified faster degassing of groundwater C-12-DIC compared to C-13-DIC. This downstream enrichment in C-13-DIC could be modelled by simply considering the isotopic equilibration of groundwater-derived DIC with the atmosphere during CO2 degassing. A second spatial pattern occurred between stream orders 2 and 4, consisting of an increase in the proportion of carbonate alkalinity to the DIC accompanied by the enrichment of C-13 in the stream DIC, which was due to the occurrence of carbonate rock weathering downstream. We could separate the contribution of these two processes (gas exchange and carbonate weathering) in the stable isotope budget of the river network. Thereafter, we built a hydrological mass balance based on drainages and the relative contribution of groundwater in streams of increasing order. After combining with the dissolved CO2 concentrations, we quantified CO2 degassing for each stream order for the whole watershed. Approximately 75% of the total CO2 degassing from the watershed occurred in first- and second-order streams. Furthermore, from stream order 2-4, our CO2 degassing fluxes compared well with those based on stream hydraulic geometry, water pCO(2), gas transfer velocity, and stream surface area. In first-order streams, however, our approach showed CO2 fluxes that were twice as large, suggesting that a fraction of degassing occurred as hotspots in the vicinity of groundwater resurgence and was missed by conventional stream sampling.

AB The Yangtze River is one of the largest and most important rivers in the world. Over the past several decades, the natural sediment regime of the Yangtze River has been altered by the construction of dams. This paper uses multi-scale entropy analysis to ascertain the impacts of large dams on the complexity of high frequency suspended sediment dynamics in the Yangtze River system, especially after impoundment of the Three Gorges Dam (TGD). In this study, the complexity of sediment dynamics is quantified by framing it within the context of entropy analysis of time series. Data on daily sediment loads for four stations located in the mainstem are analyzed for the past 60 years. The results indicate that dam construction has reduced the complexity of short-term (1-30 days) variation in sediment dynamics near the structures, but that complexity has actually increased farther downstream. This spatial pattern seems to reflect a filtering effect of the dams on the on the temporal pattern of sediment loads as well as decreased longitudinal connectivity of sediment transfer through the river system, resulting in downstream enhancement of the influence of local sediment inputs by tributaries on sediment dynamics. The TGD has had a substantial impact on the complexity of sediment series in the mainstem of the Yangtze River, especially after it became fully operational. This enhanced impact is attributed to the high trapping efficiency of this dam and its associated large reservoir. The sediment dynamics "signal" becomes more spatially variable after dam construction. This study demonstrates the spatial influence of dams on the high-frequency temporal complexity of sediment regimes and provides valuable information that can be used to guide environmental conservation of the Yangtze River.

AB An analytical solution is developed for predicting two-dimensional transient seepage into ditch drainage network receiving water from a non-uniform steady ponding field from the surface of the soil under the influence of source/sink in the flow domain. The flow domain is assumed to be saturated, homogeneous and anisotropic in nature and have finite extends in horizontal and vertical directions. The drains are assumed to be standing vertical and penetrating up to impervious layer. The water levels in the drains are unequal and invariant with time. The flow field is also assumed to be under the continuous influence of time-space dependent arbitrary source/sink term. The correctness of the proposed model is checked by developing a numerical code and also with the existing analytical solution for the simplified case. The study highlights the significance of source/sink influence in the subsurface flow. With the imposition of the source and sink term in the flow domain, the pathline and travel time of water particles started deviating from their original position and above that the side and top discharge to the drains were also observed to have a strong influence of the source/sink terms. The travel time and pathline of water particles are also observed to have a dependency on the height of water in the ditches and on the location of source/sink activation area. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB A significant body of research has focused on the role of domestic wastewater treatment systems (DWWTSs) as sources of human-specific aquatic contaminants in both developed and developing regions. However, to date few studies have sought to investigate the awareness, attitudes and behaviours of DWWTS owners and the efficacy of associated communication initiatives. The current study provides an examination of a public national engagement campaign undertaken in the Republic of Ireland which seeks to minimise the impact of DWWTSs on human and ecological health via concurrent inspection and information dissemination. Overall, 1634 respondents were surveyed using a "before and after" study design to capture if and how awareness, attitudes and behaviours evolved over time. Findings suggest that whilst the campaign provided a modest baseline to raise general awareness associated with the basic operational and maintenance requirements of DWWTS, there has been little or no behavioural engagement as a result, suggesting a significant awareness-behaviour gap. Accordingly, efforts to minimise potential human and ecological, impacts have been unsuccessful. Moreover, results suggest that public attitudes towards water-related regulation and policy became increasingly negative over the study period due to parallel political and economic issues, further complicating future engagement. Future strategies, both in Ireland and further afield, should focus on health-based demographically-focused message framing to achieve significant knowledge and attitudinal shifts amongst specific population cohorts, and thus bring about significant behavioural change. Study findings and recommendations may be used by myriad stakeholders including local, provincial and national authorities to effectively engage with individuals and communities prior to and during implementation of legislative and policy-based instruments within numerous spheres including climate change adaptation, environmental quality, hydrological risk, and hydro-ecology.

AB This work is meant to summarize lessons learned on using satellite precipitation products for riverine flood modeling and to propose future directions in this field of research. Firstly, the most common satellite precipitation products (SPPs) during the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) and Global Precipitation Mission (GPM) eras are reviewed. Secondly, we discuss the main errors and uncertainty sources in these datasets that have the potential to affect streamflow and runoff model simulations. Thirdly, past studies that focused on using SPPs for predicting streamflow and runoff are analyzed. As the impact of floods depends not only on the characteristics of the flood itself, but also on the characteristics of the region (population density, land use, geophysical and climatic factors), a regional analysis is required to assess the performance of hydrologic models in monitoring and predicting floods. The performance of SPP-forced hydrological models was shown to largely depend on several factors, including precipitation type, seasonality, hydrological model formulation, topography. Across several basins around the world, the bias in SPPs was recognized as a major issue and bias correction methods of different complexity were shown to significantly reduce streamflow errors. Model re-calibration was also raised as a viable option to improve SPP-forced streamflow simulations, but caution is necessary when recalibrating models with SPP, which may result in unrealistic parameter values. From a general standpoint, there is significant potential for using satellite observations in flood forecasting, but the performance of SPP in hydrological modeling is still inadequate for operational purposes.

AB Wetlands are conservation priorities worldwide, due to their high biodiversity and productivity, but are under threat from agricultural and climate change stresses. To improve the water management practices and resource allocation in these complex systems, a modelling approach has been developed to estimate potential recharge for data poor catchments using rainfall data and basic assumptions regarding soil and aquifer properties. The Verlorenvlei estuarine lake (RAMSAR #525) on the west coast of South Africa is a data poor catchment where rainfall records have been supplemented with farmer's rainfall records. The catchment has multiple competing users. To determine the ecological reserve for the wetlands, the spatial and temporal distribution of recharge had to be well constrained using the J2000 rainfall/runoff model. The majority of rainfall occurs in the mountains (650 mm/yr) and considerably less in the valley (+/- 280 mm/yr). Percolation was modelled as similar to 3.6% of rainfall in the driest parts of the catchment, similar to 10% of rainfall in the moderately wet parts of the catchment and similar to 8.4% but up to 28.9% of rainfall in the wettest parts of the catchment. The model results are representative of rainfall and water level measurements in the catchment, and compare well with water table fluctuation technique, although estimates are dissimilar to previous estimates within the catchment. This is most likely due to the daily timestep nature of the model, in comparison to other yearly average methods. These results go some way in understanding the fact that although most semi-arid catchments have very low yearly recharge estimates, they are still capable of sustaining high biodiversity levels. This demonstrates the importance of incorporating shorter term recharge event modeling for improving recharge estimates. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Given the importance of phosphorus (P) in the eutrophication of natural waters, this study considered the long-term time series of total phosphorus (TP) and total reactive phosphorus (TRP) in British rivers from 1974 to 2012. The approach included not only trend analysis of fluxes and concentrations but also change point analysis. TP and TRP concentrations and fluxes in British rivers have declined since the mid-1980s. Over the last decade of the record the majority of individual sites did show significant downward trends in TP and TRP concentrations but, in 28% of cases for TRP concentration and 14% of cases for TP concentration, the decadal trend was a significant increase. Out of 230 sites, 136 showed a significant step decrease in TRP concentration; no sites showed a significant step increase. The modal year for the step changes for both TRP concentration and flux was 1997. Step changes are likely associated with improvements made at sewage treatment works to comply with the Urban Waste Water Treatment Directive (91/271/EEC). The decrease in TRP concentration due to the step change were in the range of 0.68% and 89% with a geometric mean of 22%, with the rest of the decrease accounted by long-term, persistent downward trend.

AB This paper presents a new methodology for optimizing Water Quality Monitoring (WQM) networks of reservoirs and lakes using the concept of the value of information (VOI) and utilizing results of a calibrated numerical water quality simulation model. With reference to the value of information theory, water quality of every checkpoint with a specific prior probability differs in time. After analyzing water quality samples taken from potential monitoring points, the posterior probabilities are updated using the Baye's theorem, and VOI of the samples is calculated. In the next step, the stations with maximum VOI is selected as optimal stations. This process is repeated for each sampling interval to obtain optimal monitoring network locations for each interval. The results of the proposed VOl-based methodology is compared with those obtained using an entropy theoretic approach. As the results of the two methodologies would be partially different, in the next step, the results are combined using a weighting method. Finally, the optimal sampling interval and location of WQM stations are chosen using the Evidential Reasoning (ER) decision making method. The efficiency and applicability of the methodology are evaluated using available water quantity and quality data of the Karkheh Reservoir in the southwestern part of Iran. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB One decade after closure of the Salsigne mine (SW France), As contamination persisted in surface water, groundwater and soil near and down-gradient from the reclaimed ore processing site (OPS). We assess the fate of As and other associated chalcophilic MTEs, and their transport in the surface-water/groundwater/soil continuum down-gradient from the reclaimed OPS, using Sr-isotopic fingerprinting. The Sr-isotope ratio was used as a tracer of transfer processes in this hydro-geosystem and was combined to sequential extraction of soil samples to evaluate the impact of contaminated soil on the underlying phreatic groundwater. The contrast in Sr isotope compositions of the different soil fractions reflects several Sr sources in the soil. In the complex hydro-geosystem around the OPS, the transport of As and MTEs is affected by a succession of factors, such as (1) Existence of a reducing zone in the aquifer below the reclaimed OPS, where groundwater shows relatively high As and MTEs contents, (2) Groundwater discharge into the stream near the reclaimed OPS causing an increase in As and MTE concentrations in surface water; (3) Partial co-precipitation of As with Fe-oxyhydroxides, contributing to some attenuation of As contents in surface water; (4) Infiltration of contaminated stream water into the unconfined aquifer down-gradient from the reclaimed OPS; (5) Accumulation of As and MTEs in soil irrigated with contaminated stream-and groundwater; (6) Release of As and MTEs from labile soil fractions to underlying the groundwater.

AB The inverse problem of groundwater models is often ill-posed and model parameters are likely to be poorly constrained. Identifiability is improved if diverse data types are used for parameter estimation. However, some models, including detailed solute transport models, are further limited by prohibitive computation times. This often precludes the use of concentration data for parameter estimation, even if those data are available. In the case of surface water-groundwater (SW-GW) models, concentration data can provide SW-GW mixing ratios, which efficiently constrain the estimate of exchange flow, but are rarely used. We propose to reduce computational limits by simulating SW-GW exchange at a sink (well or drain) based on particle tracking under steady state flow conditions. Particle tracking is used to simulate advective transport. A comparison between the particle tracking surrogate model and an advective-dispersive model shows that dispersion can often be neglected when the mixing ratio is computed for a sink, allowing for use of the particle tracking surrogate model. The surrogate model was implemented to solve the inverse problem for a real SW-GW transport problem with heads and concentrations combined in a weighted hybrid objective function. The resulting inversion showed markedly reduced uncertainty in the transmissivity field compared to calibration on head data alone. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Subsurface flow is often recognized as a dominant runoff generation process. However, observing subsurface properties, and understanding how they control flow pathways, remains challenging. This paper investigates how surface slope and bedrock cleavage control subsurface flow pathways in a slate bedrock headwater catchment in Luxembourg, characterised by a double-peak streamflow response. We use a range of experimental techniques, including field observations of soil and bedrock characteristics, and a sprinkling experiment at a site located 40 m upslope from the stream channel. The sprinkling experiment uses Br- as a tracer, which is measured at a well downslope from the plot and at various locations along the stream, together with well and stream hydrometric responses. The sprinkling experiment is used to estimate velocities and celerities, which in turn are used to infer flow pathways. Our results indicate that the single or first peak of double-peak events is rainfall-driven (controlled by rainfall) while the second peak is storage-driven (controlled by storage). The comparison between velocity and celerity estimates suggests a fast flowpath component connecting the hillslope to the stream, but velocity information was too scarce to fully support such a hypothesis. In addition, different estimates of celerities suggest a seasonal influence of both rainfall intensity rate and residual water storage on the celerity responses at the hillslope scale. At the catchment outlet, the estimated of the total mass of Br- recovered in the stream was about 2.5% of the application. Further downstream, the estimate mass of Br- was about 4.0% of the application. This demonstrates that flowpaths do not appear to align with the slope gradient. In contrast, they appear to follow the strike of the bedrock cleavage. Our results have expanded our understanding of the importance of the subsurface, in particular the underlying bedrock systems, and the importance of cleavage orientation, as well as topography, in controlling subsurface flow direction in this catchment.

AB Temporal and spatial monitoring play a significant role in evaluating and examining the riverbank morphology and its spatiotemporal changes. Unlike the terrestrial laser scanners, other previously used methods such as satellite images, total station surveying, and erosion pins have limited application to quantify the small-scale bank variations due to the lack of rapid survey and resolution in data acquisition. High cost, lack of availability, specialized equipment and hard movement of laser scanners make it necessary to develop new accurate, economical and easily available methods. The present study aims to test the Kinect photogrametric technology for measuring and assessing riverbank variations in laboratory environment. For this purpose, three models of layered soil blocks for three different levels of groundwater (i.e. 24, 34 and 44 cm) were designed to investigate the seepage erosion behavior experimentally. The results indicate the high accuracy of Kinect in measuring the bank erosion cavity dimensions (i.e., 0.5% error) with high spatial resolution data (i.e. 300,000 points per frame). The high speed of Kinect in riverbank scanning enables the analysis of time variations of mechanisms such as seepage erosion which occurs rather rapidly. The results confirmed that there is a power relationship between the seepage gradient and the time of the bank failure with a determination coefficient of 0.97. Moreover, an increase in the level of groundwater on the riverbank increases the rate of undercutting retreat that caused more rapid failure of the riverbank. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB Recent research on water demand short-term forecasting has shown that models using univariate time series based on historical data are useful and can be combined with other prediction methods to reduce errors. The behavior of water demands in drinking water distribution networks focuses on their repetitive nature and, under meteorological conditions and similar consumers, allows the development of a heuristic forecast model that, in turn, combined with other autoregressive models, can provide reliable forecasts. In this study, a parallel adaptive weighting strategy of water consumption forecast for the next 24-48 h, using univariate time series of potable water consumption, is proposed. Two Portuguese potable water distribution networks are used as case studies where the only input data are the consumption of water and the national calendar. For the development of the strategy, the Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) method and a short-term forecast heuristic algorithm are used. Simulations with the model showed that, when using a parallel adaptive weighting strategy, the prediction error can be reduced by 15.96% and the average error by 9.20%. This reduction is important in the control and management of water supply systems. The proposed methodology can be extended to other forecast methods, especially when it comes to the availability of multiple forecast models. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Although process-based distributed hydrological models (PDHMs) are evolving rapidly over the last few decades, their extensive applications are still challenged by the computational expenses. This study attempted, for the first time, to apply the numerically efficient MacCormack algorithm to overland flow routing in a representative high-spatial resolution PDHM, i.e., the distributed hydrology-soil-vegetation model (DHSVM), in order to improve its computational efficiency. The analytical verification indicates that both the semi and full versions of the MacCormack schemes exhibit robust numerical stability and are more computationally efficient than the conventional explicit linear scheme. The full-version outperforms the semi-version in terms of simulation accuracy when a same time step is adopted. The semi-MacCormack scheme was implemented into DHSVM (version 3.1.2) to solve the kinematic wave equations for overland flow routing. The performance and practicality of the enhanced DHSVM-MacCormack model was assessed by performing two groups of modeling experiments in the Mercer Creek watershed, a small urban catchment near Bellevue, Washington. The experiments show that DHSVM-MacCormack can considerably improve the computational efficiency without compromising the simulation accuracy of the original DHSVM model. More specifically, with the same computational environment and model settings, the computational time required by DHSVM-MacCormack can be reduced to several dozen minutes for a simulation period of three months (in contrast with one day and a half by the original DHSVM model) without noticeable sacrifice of the accuracy. The MacCormack scheme proves to be applicable to overland flow routing in DHSVM, which implies that it can be coupled into other PHDMs for watershed routing to either significantly improve their computational efficiency or to make the kinematic wave routing for high resolution modeling computational feasible.

AB Soil water and its efficient use are critical to sustainable productivity of rainfed orchards under the context of climate change in water-limited areas. Here, we combined micro-catchments for collecting hillslope runoff, named fish-scale pits, with mulches to examine water infiltration and water consumption of fruit trees using in situ soil moisture monitoring, the micro-lysimeter and sap flow methods via a two-year experiment in a rainfed jujube orchard on China's Loess Plateau. This experiment included four treatments: fish-scale pit with branch mulching (FB), fish-scale pit with straw mulching (FS), fish-scale pit without mulching (F), and bare land treatment (CK). The results showed that only about 50% of the rainfall infiltrated the soil for CK during the 2014 and 2015 growing seasons. The fish-scale pit without mulching experienced significantly increased rainfall infiltration by 41.38 and 27.30%, respectively, but also increased evaporation by 42.28 and 65.59%, respectively, compared to CK during the two growing seasons. The jujube transpiration significantly increased by 45.64-53.10% over CK, and the evaporation decreased by 42.47-53.50% when fish-scale pits were mulched with branches or straw. Taken together, the results show that the fish-scale pits and mulching combinations efficiently increased rainfall infiltration and jujube evapotranspiration in the experimental jujube orchard. The findings here provide an insight into the field water management for hillslope orchards in water-limited regions. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Due to shortage of flow monitoring data in ungauged semidiurnal river, 'environmental flow' (EF) determination based on its key component 'minimum low flow' is always difficult. For EF assessment this study selected a reach immediately after the Halda-Karnafuli confluence, a unique breeding ground for Indian Carp fishes of Bangladesh. As part of an ungauged tidal river, EF threshold establishment faces challenges in changing ecological paradigms with periodic change of tides and hydrologic alterations. This study describes a novel approach through modeling framework comprising hydrological, hydrodynamic and habitat simulation model. The EF establishment was conceptualized according to the hydrologic process of an ungauged semi-diurnal tidal regime in four steps. Initially, a hydrologic model coupled with a hydrodynamic model to simulate flow considering land use changes effect on streamfiow, seepage loss of channel, friction dominated tidal decay as well as lack of long term flow characteristics. Secondly, to define hydraulic habitat feature, a statistical analysis on derived flow data was performed to identify 'habitat suitability'. Thirdly, to observe the ecological habitat behavior based on the identified hydrologic alteration, hydraulic habitat features were investigated. Finally, based on the combined habitat suitability index flow alteration and ecological response relationship was established. Then, the obtained EF provides a set of low flow indices of desired regime and thus the obtained discharge against maximum Weighted Usable Area (WUA) was defined as EF threshold for the selected reach. A suitable EF regime condition was obtained within flow range 25-30.1 m(3)/s i.e., around 10-12% of the mean annual runoff of 245 m(3)/s and these findings are within researchers' recommendation of minimum flow requirement. Additionally it was observed that tidal characteristics are dominant process in semi-diurnal regime. However, during the study period (2010-2015) the validated model with those reported observations can provide guidance for the decision support system (DSS) to maintain EF range in an ungauged tidal river.

AB Rivers are an important source of CO2 to the atmosphere, however, mountainous rivers and streams with high emission rates are not well studied particularly in China. We report the first detailed investigation on monsoonal mountainous rivers in the Three Gorges Reservoir (TGR) region, with a focus on the riverine CO2 partial pressure (pCO(2)), CO2 degassing and their potential controls. The pCO(2) levels ranged from 50 to 6019 mu atm with averages of 1573 (SD. +/- 1060) in dry Autumn and 1276 (SD. +/- 1166) mu atm in wet Summer seasons. 94% of samples were supersaturated with CO2 with respect to the atmospheric equilibrium (410 mu atm). Monsoonal precipitation controlled pCO(2) seasonality, with both the maximal and minimal levels occurring in the wet season, and showing the overall effects of dilution. Riverine pCO(2) could be predicted better in the dry season using pH, DO% and DTP, whereas pH and DOC were better predictors in the wet season. We conclude that in-situ respiration of allochthonous organic carbon, rather than photosynthesis, resulted in negative relationships between pCO(2) and DO and pH, and thus CO2 supersaturation. Photosynthetic primary production was effectively limited by rapid flow velocity and short residence time. The estimated water-to-air CO2 emission rate in the TGR rivers was 350 319 in the Autumn and lower, yet more variable at 326 439 mmol/m(2)/d in Summer. Our calculated CO2 areal fluxes were in the upper-level magnitude of published data, demonstrating the importance of mountainous rivers and streams as a global greenhouse gas source, and urgency for more detailed studies on CO2 degassing, to address a global data gap for these environments.

DT Article
DE Groundwater; Response time; Transient; Steady state; Mean action time
ID STEADY-STATE; FRAMEWORK; TRANSPORT; DISCHARGE; RECHARGE
AB We study measures of the amount of time required for transient flow in heterogeneous porous media to effectively reach steady state, also known as the response time. Here, we develop a new approach that extends the concept of mean action time. Previous applications of the theory of mean action time to estimate the response time use the first two central moments of the probability density function associated with the transition from the initial condition, at t = 0, to the steady state condition that arises in the long time limit, as t -> infinity. This previous approach leads to a computationally convenient estimation of the response time, but the accuracy can be poor. Here, we outline a powerful extension using the first k raw moments, showing how to produce an extremely accurate estimate by making use of asymptotic properties of the cumulative distribution function. Results are validated using an existing laboratory scale data set describing flow in a homogeneous porous medium. In addition, we demonstrate how the results also apply to flow in heterogeneous porous media. Overall, the new method is: (i) extremely accurate; and (ii) computationally inexpensive. In fact, the computational cost of the new method is orders of magnitude less than the computational effort required to study the response time by solving the transient flow equation. Furthermore, the approach provides a rigorous mathematical connection with the heuristic argument that the response time for flow in a homogeneous porous medium is proportional to L-2/D, where L is a relevant length scale, and D is the aquifer diffusivity. Here, we extend such heuristic arguments by providing a clear mathematical definition of the proportionality constant. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this paper we suggest to innovatively use scaling laws and more specifically Universal Multifractals (UM) to analyse simulated surface runoff and compare the retrieved scaling features with the rainfall ones. The methodology is tested on a 3 km(2) semi-urbanised with a steep slope study area located in the Paris area along the Bievre River. First Multi-Hydro, a fully distributed model is validated on this catchment for four rainfall events measured with the help of a C-band radar. The uncertainty associated with small scale unmeasured rainfall, i.e. occurring below the 1 km x 1 km x 5 min observation scale, is quantified with the help of stochastic downscaled rainfall fields. It is rather significant for simulated flow and more limited on overland water depth for these rainfall events. Overland depth is found to exhibit a scaling behaviour over small scales (10 m-80 m) which can be related to fractal features of the sewer network. No direct and obvious dependency between the overland depth multifractal features (quality of the scaling and UM parameters) and the rainfall ones was found. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB Continuous water-table (WT) measurements from peatlands are scarce and - if existing at all-very short. Consequently, proxy indicators are critically needed to simulate hydrological changes in peatlands over longer time periods. In this study, we demonstrate that tree-ring width (TRW) records of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) growing in the Cepkeliai peatland (southern Lithuania) can be used as a proxy to reconstruct hydrological variability in a raised bog environment. A two-step modelling procedure was applied to extend existing measurements and to develop a new and longer peatland WT time series. To this end, we used instrumental WT measurements extending back to 2002, meteorological records, a P-PET (difference between precipitation and potential evapotranspiration) series covering the period 1935-2014, so as to construct a tree-ring based time series of WT fluctuations at the site for the period 1870-2014. Strongest correlations were obtained between average annual WT measured at the bog margin and total P-PET over 7 years (r = 0.923, p < 0.00001), as well as between modelled WT and standardized TRW data with a two years lag (r = -0.602, p < 0.001) for those periods where WT fluctuated at the level of pine roots which is typically at <50 cm depth below the peat surface. Our results suggest that moisture is a limiting factor for tree growth at peatlands, but below a certain WT level (<50 cm under the soil surface), drought becomes a limiting factor instead. To validate the WT reconstruction from the Cepkeliai bog, results were compared to Nemunas river runoff since CE 1812 (r = 0.39, p < 0.00001, 1870-2014). We conclude that peatlands can act both as sinks and sources of greenhouse gases in case that hydrological conditions change, but that hydrological lags and complex feedbacks still hamper our understanding of several processes affecting the hydrology and carbon budget in peatlands. We therefore call for the development of further proxy records of water-table variability in peatlands to improve our understanding of peatland responses to climatic changes. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB The vertical hydraulic conductivity (K-v) of a 30-m thick surficial clayey aquitard overlying a regional aquifer at an industrial site in the Mississippi River Valley in Louisiana was investigated via intensive hydraulic characterization using high resolution vertical hydraulic head profiles with temporal monitoring and laboratory tests. A study area was instrumented with a semi-circular array of piezometers at many depths in the aquitard at equal distance from a large capacity pumping well including replicate piezometers. Profiles showed negligible head differential to 20 m bgs, below which there was an abrupt change in vertical gradients over the lower 8-10 m of the aquitard. Hydraulic characteristics are strongly associated with depositional environment; the upper zone of minimal head differentials with depth and minimal variation over time correlates with Paleo-Mississippi River backswamp deposits, while the lower zone with large head differentials and slow but moderate head changes correlates with lacustrine deposits. The lower zone restricts groundwater flow between the surface and underlying regional aquifer, which is hydraulically connected to the Mississippi River. Lab tests on lacustrine samples show low K-v (8 x 10(-11)-4 x 10(-9) m/s) bracketing field estimates (6 x 10(-10) m/s) from 1-D model fits to piezometric data in response to large aquifer head changes. The slow response indicates absence of through-going open fractures in the lacustrine unit, consistent with geotechnical properties (high plasticity, normal consolidation), suggesting high integrity that protects the underlying aquifer from surficial contamination. The lack of vertical gradients in the overlying backswamp unit indicates abundant secondary permeability features (e.g. fractures, rootholes) consistent with depositional and weathering conditions. 2-D stylized transient flow simulations including both units supports this interpretation. Other published reports on surficial aquitards in the Gulf Coast Region pertain to Pleistocene deposits that lack laterally extensive lacustrine units and where K-v is enhanced by secondary permeability features, resulting in clayey aquitards with poor integrity.

AB We propose in this article a regional study of uncertainties in IDF curves derived from point-rainfall maxima. We develop two generalized extreme value models based on the simple scaling assumption, first in the frequentist framework and second in the Bayesian framework. Within the frequentist framework, uncertainties are obtained i) from the Gaussian density stemming from the asymptotic normality theorem of the maximum likelihood and ii) with a bootstrap procedure. Within the Bayesian framework, uncertainties are obtained from the posterior densities. We confront these two frameworks on the same database covering a large region of 100, 000 km(2) in southern France with contrasted rainfall regime, in order to be able to draw conclusion that are not specific to the data. The two frameworks are applied to 405 hourly stations with data back to the 1980's, accumulated in the range 3 h-120 h. We show that i) the Bayesian framework is more robust than the frequentist one to the starting point of the estimation procedure, ii) the posterior and the bootstrap densities are able to better adjust uncertainty estimation to the data than the Gaussian density, and iii) the bootstrap density give unreasonable confidence intervals, in particular for return levels associated to large return period. Therefore our recommendation goes towards the use of the Bayesian framework to compute uncertainty. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Loess and purple soils are two very important cultivated soils, with the former in the loess region and the latter in southern sub-tropical region of China, featured with high-risks of erosion, considerable differences of soil structures due to differences in mineral and nutrient compositions. Study on soil erodibility (K-r) and critical shear stress (tau(c)) of these two soils is beneficial to predict soil erosion with such models as WEPP. In this study, rill erosion experimental data sets of the two soils are used for estimating their K-r and tau(c) before they are compared to understand their differences of rill erosion behaviors. The maximum detachment rates of the loess and purple soils are calculated under different hydrodynamic conditions (flow rates: 2, 4, 8 L/min; slope gradients: 5 degrees 10 degrees 15 degrees 20 degrees 25 degrees) through analytical and numerical methods respectively. Analytical method used the derivative of the function between sediment concentration and rill length to estimate potential detachment rates, at the rill beginning. Numerical method estimated potential detachment rates with the experimental data, at the rill beginning and 0.5 m location. The K-r and tau(c) of these two soils are determined by the linear equation based on experimental data. Results show that the methods could well estimate the K-r and tau(c) of these two soils as they remain basically unchanged under different hydrodynamic conditions. The K-r value of loess soil is about twice of the purple soil, whereas the tau(c) is about half of that. The numerical results have good correlations with the analytical values. These results can be useful in modeling rill erosion processes of loess and purple soils. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Streamflow reconstructions based on paleoclimate proxies provide much longer records than the short instrumental period records on which water resource management plans are currently based. In Australia there is a lack of in-situ high resolution paleoclimate proxy records, but remote proxies with teleconnections to Australian climate have utility in producing streamflow reconstructions. Here we investigate, via a case study for a catchment in eastern Australia, the novel use of an Antarctic ice-core based rainfall reconstruction within a Budyko-framework to reconstruct similar to 1000 years of annual streamflow. The resulting stream-flow reconstruction captures interannual to decadal variability in the instrumental streamflow, validating both the use of the ice core rainfall proxy record and the Budyko-framework method. In the preinstrumental era the streamflow reconstruction shows longer wet and dry epochs and periods of streamflow variability that are higher than observed in the instrumental era. Importantly, for both the instrumental record and preinstrumental reconstructions, the wet (dry) epochs in the rainfall record are shorter (longer) in the streamflow record and this non-linearity must be considered when inferring hydroclimatic risk or historical water availability directly from rainfall proxy records alone. These insights provide a better understanding of present infrastructure vulnerability in the context of past climate variability for eastern Australia. The streamflow reconstruction presented here also provides a better understanding of the range of hydroclimatic variability possible, and therefore represents a more realistic baseline on which to quantify the potential impacts of anthropogenic climate change on water security.

AB Prediction of Ground Water Level (GWL) is extremely important for sustainable use and management of ground water resource. The motivations for this work is to understand the relationship between Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) derived terrestrial water change (Delta TWS) data and GWL, so that Delta TWS could be used as a proxy measurement for GWL. In our study, we have selected five observation wells from different geographic regions in India. The datasets are unevenly spaced time series data which restricts us from applying standard time series methodologies and therefore in order to model and predict GWL with the help of Delta TWS, we have built Linear Regression Model (LRM), Support Vector Regression (SVR) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN). Comparative performances of LRM, SVR and ANN have been evaluated with the help of correlation coefficient (rho) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) between the actual and fitted (for training dataset) or predicted (for test dataset) values of GWL. It has been observed in our study that Delta TWS is highly significant variable to model GWL and the amount of total variations in GWL that could be explained with the help of Delta TWS varies from 36.48% to 74.28% (0.3648 <= R-2 <= 0.7428). We have found that for the model GWL similar to Delta TWS, for both training and test dataset, performances of SVR and ANN are better than that of LRM in terms of rho and RMSE. It also has been found in our study that with the inclusion of meteorological variables along with Delta TWS as input parameters to model GWL, the performance of SVR improves and it performs better than ANN. These results imply that for modelling irregular time series GWL data, Delta TWS could be very useful. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB PoliVal-ICP antivenom is produced from plasma of horses immunized toward the venoms of Bothrops asper, Crotalus simus and Lachesis stenophrys. The antibody response induced by these venoms confers PoliVal-ICP the capacity to neutralize the venoms of the most important Central American viperids, including not only homologous venoms (i.e., venoms used as immunogen), but many heterologous venoms (i.e., venoms not used as immunogen). In this work, the individual contributions of homologous venoms to the paraspecificity of PoliVal-ICP were inferred from the capacity of experimental mono specific antivenoms toward venoms of B. asper (anti-Ba), C. simus (anti-Cs) and L stenophrys (anti-Ls), and an experimental polyspecific antivenom (anti-Ba/Cs/Ls) to neutralize the lethality induced by different venoms in mice. It was found that all antivenoms neutralized their corresponding homologous venoms. Moreover, the anti-Ba antivenom cross-neutralized the venoms of Agkistrodon howardgloydi, Atropoides picadoi, Bothriechis lateralis, Bothriechis supraciliaris and Porthidium ophryomegas; the anti-Cs antivenom cross-neutralized the venoms of B. lateralis, B. supraciliaris, Cerrophidion sasai and Porthidium nasutum; and the anti-Ls antivenom cross-neutralized the venoms of B. lateralis, B. supraciliaris, C. sasai and Lachesis melanocephala. All venoms neutralized by any monospecific antivenom were also neutralized by the anti-Ba/Cs/Ls antivenom. Venoms of Atropoides mexicanus, Bothriechis nigroviridis and Bothriechis schlegelii were not neutralized by any experimental antivenom, thus explaining the limitations of PoliVal-ICP to neutralize these venoms. Consequently, an enlargement of the neutralization scope of PoliVal-ICP could be achieved by including these venoms in the group of those used as immunogens. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB This study was designed to assess the contribution of feeding behavior to inter-individual variability of paralytic shellfish toxin (PST) accumulation in the Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas. For this purpose 42 oysters were exposed for 2 days to non-toxic algae and then for 2 other days to the PST producer Alexandrium minutum. Individual clearance rate (CR) of oysters was continuously monitored over the 4 days using an ecophysiological measurement system. Comparison of CR values when exposed to toxic and non toxic algae allowed to estimate a clearance rate inhibition index (CRII). Toxin concentration of oysters was quantified at the end of the experiment. These data allowed to estimate the toxin accumulation efficiency (TAE) as the ratio of toxin accumulated on toxin consumed. Changes of clearance rate during the experiment indicated that all individuals stopped feeding immediately after being exposed to A. minutum for at least 7 h. This fast response likely corresponded to a behavioral mechanism of avoidance rather to a toxin-induced response. Individuals also showed high inter-variability in their recovery of filtration after this period. Most of the inter-individual variability (78%) in PST accumulation in C gigas could be explained by the consumption of A. minutum cells, thus emphasizing the importance of the feeding behavior in accumulation. Based on the toxin concentration in their tissues, oysters were clustered in 3 groups showing contrasted patterns of PST accumulation: the high accumulation group was characterized by high feeding rates both on non-toxic and toxic diet and subsequently a low CRII and high TAE. Inversely, the low accumulation group was characterized by low filtration rates, high CRII and low TAE. Both filtration capacity and sensitivity of oysters to toxins may account for the differences in their accumulation. The contribution of TAE in PST accumulation is discussed and might result from differences in assimilation and detoxification abilities among individuals. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Bothrops venezuelensis snake venoms, from five localities in the North-Central Venezuelan regions, showed biochemical and haemostatic differences. In this study, bioactivities of B. venezuelensis venoms from different regions (Aragua state; Waraira Repano (Capital District); Baruta, La Boyera and Lagunetica (Miranda state)) were compared using both natural and synthetic substrates. The protein contents of these venoms were Lagunetica 89%, La Boyera 79%, Baruta 71%, Waraira Repano 68% and Aragua 64%. Toxic activities effects were: Intraperitoneal LD(50)s: Aragua-14 mg/kg; Waraira Repano-6.4 mg/kg; Baruta: 8.3 mg/kg; La Boyera-4.4 mg/kg; Lagunetica-16.2 mg/kg. The MHD results: Aragua-21.4 g/mouse; Waraira Repano-2.5 mu g/mouse; Baruta-1.2 mu g/mouse; La Boyera-1.4 mu g/mouse and Lagunetica-12 mu g/mouse. The hide powder azure results: Aragua-1.24 U/mg; La Boyera-2.26 U/mg; Baruta-2.83 U/mg; Lagunetica-3.28 U/mg and Waraira Repano-5.77 U/mg. Esterase specific activity on BAEE results: Waraira Repano-666.66 U/mg; La Boyera-805.5 U/mg; Baruta-900.00 U/mg; Lagunetica-922.19 U/mg and Aragua-1960.67 U/mg. Casein zymography showed digestion bands in the molecular weight above 100 and at 66.2 and 21.5 kDa. Analysis of casein degradation by SDS-PAGE showed two different degradation patterns. Fibrinolytic activity (mm(2)/mu g) on fibrin plates results: Aragua-6.07; Lagunetica-27.6; Waraira Repano-35.7; La Boyera-44.27 and Baruta-45.63. In the fibrinogenolytic assay, the five venoms completely degraded the alpha chain after 1 min of incubation. None of the venoms completely degraded the beta and gamma chains after 24 h incubation. The research indicated that venoms of B. venezuelensis of different geographic areas in Venezuela exhibit variances in composition and component concentrations; except the Aragua venom, all of them had high proteolytic activities.

AB Botulinum neurotoxins (BoNTs; serotypes A-G) are metalloproteases, which cleave and inactivate cellular proteins essential for neurotransmitter release. In bacterial cultures, BoNTs are secreted as a complex of the neurotoxin and a group of neurotoxin associated proteins (NAPS). Under physiological condition (pH 7.4), this complex is believed to be dissociated to separate the neurotoxin from NAPs. BoNT consists of a 50 kDa light (L) chain (LC or catalytic domain) and a 100 kDa heavy (H) chain (or HC) linked through a disulfide bond and other non-covalent interactions. The cell intoxication involves three major steps; binding, membrane translocation and inhibition of neurotransmitter release. The last step of intoxication, endopeptidase activity, is very unique and specific that can be used for detection of the complex and isolated forms of the toxin. A fluorescent tag-labeled synthetic peptide (SNAPtide) derived from a segment of SNAP-25, an intracellular substrate of BoNT/A, is used to detect and assay the endopeptidase activity of BoNT/A. The detection of the signal is based on the change in the fluorescence energy transfer after selective cleavage of the peptide by the BoNT/A.
   In this report, we demonstrate that SNAPtide as a commonly used substrate widely differ in reaction with BoNT/A complex, BoNT/A, and BoNT/A light chain. These findings have implications for assays used in detection, and in screening potential inhibitors. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Venom toxicity assessments are often based upon non-native surrogate prey species that are not consumed in the wild by the venomous predator. This raises questions about the relevance of toxicity results on these "model" prey in addressing ecological or evolutionary questions about venom effects on native prey. We explore this issue by comparing the toxicity of venom from pygmy rattlesnakes (Sistrurus miliarius) on taxonomically-diverse sets of model (non-native) and native prey. Specifically, we compared rattlesnake venom toxicity for nine species from three broad taxonomic groups of prey (reptiles, mammals, and amphibians) to determine whether estimates of venom toxicity for the non-native model species of each group was representative of species which were native prey. In all three groups, model species (Anolis sagrei, Mus musculus, and Lithobates pipiens) had a significantly different mortality response from one or more of the native prey species (Anolis carolinensis, Peromyscus gossypinus, Lithobates sphenocephalus, Hyla cinerea, and Hyla squirella) that the models were meant to represent. Two features of our results suggest an importance of evolutionary history in understanding these differences. First, there was a phylogenetic component to prey responses to venom in that in each group, non-native models and congeneric native prey showed more similar responses than prey from other genera suggesting that venom may act on common prey targets that result from common ancestry. Second, native prey generally showed higher LD50 values than their non-native counterparts, suggesting greater resistance to venom from a predator with which they interact in nature. Our results suggest that researchers should use native prey to generate measures of venom toxicity that are ecologically and evolutionarily relevant. If this is not possible using "model" prey species that are close taxonomic relatives to natural prey may be a reasonable alternative. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

   MICE
AB Botulinum neurotoxin type A (BoNT/A) is used as a therapeutic tool to induce chemical denervation of spastically contracted muscles, yet the neurotoxin can also cause skeletal muscle atrophy. The underlying proteolytic mechanisms that induce this atrophy remain unclear. Our previous work has highlighted increased ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS) activity in soleus muscle of male Sprague Dawley rats following hind limb injection of BoNT/A, with the chymotrypsin-like activity of the 20s proteasome the most active. Thus, we chose to inhibit 20s proteasome activity in BoNT/A injected hind limb to determine the effect on soleus muscle atrophy. Epoxomicin is commonly used to inhibit the proteasome in vivo, binding specifically and irreversibly to the 20s proteasome catalytic subunits. Daily subcutaneous injections of epoxomicin abolished BoNT/A-induced elevations in 20s chymotrypsin-like activity both 3 days and 10 days post BoNT/A injection. Furthermore, BoNT/A-induced elevations in polyubiquitination remained elevated in BoNT/A epoxomicin treated muscle, presumably due to epoxomicin's inhibition of the proteasome causing a back-up of polyubiquitinated proteins. Despite inhibition of the proteasome, epoxomicin was insufficient to significantly attenuate soleus muscle fiber atrophy 3 days following BoNT/A injection however, 10 days of daily epoxomicin injection was sufficient to spare 20% of muscle wasting. The mechanism of the remaining 80% of BoNT/A-induced atrophy presumably occurs via mechanisms outside of the 20s proteasome. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Four chemically similar alkaloids, anabasine, anabaseine, epibatidine and dimethylphenylpiperazinium (DMPP), are potent nicotinic acetylcholine receptor agonists of fetal muscle nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in human TE-671 cells. Based on results with these cells, we hypothesized that the alkaloids would completely inhibit ultrasound-monitored fetal movement in a goat model. Different, single doses of anabasine, anabaseine, epibatidine, DMPP, or saline control were administered I.V. to pregnant goats on day 40 of gestation and the number of fetal movements per 5 min sample was measured by ultrasound at times 0, 0.5, 1, 2, 4 and 8 h. The differences among does in fetal movements were more consistent at dosing and following recovery for doses of anabasine above 0.125 mg/kg compared to the other compounds and dosages. Anabasine actions were dose-dependent with an IC50 value of similar to 0.1 mg/kg, and, at a dose of 0.8 mg/kg, completely inhibited fetal movement for 1.5 h after dosing. Anabaseine, epibatidine, and DMPP failed to completely inhibit fetal movement in day 40 pregnant goats at doses predicted to be effective. These results suggest that while experiments with TE-671 cells provide valuable information and predictions of the actions of plant alkaloids on fetal movement, in vivo experiments are still required in order to determine the ability of an alkaloid to inhibit fetal movement in livestock species. Moreover, other pharmacological properties such as receptor differences between mammalian species and differences in the pharmacokinetic properties of the alkaloids also are likely to weaken teratologic predictions based solely on the in vitro data.

AB Four 30 residue conotoxin have been identified from the venom of C. amadis. MS/MS analysis of crude venom subjected to global reduction/alkylation yielded fragmentation patterns, which permitted searching and matching with a database of putative mature toxin sequences obtained from transcriptomic analysis. Of the four sequences identified, Am3408(Am6.1b), Am3452(Am6.1c), Am3136(Am6.2a) and Am3214(Am6.2b), three contain bromotryptophan residues, while an additional post translational modification, gamma carboxylation of glutamic acid, is present in Am3408(Am6.lb)/3452(Am6.1c). The conotoxins belong to the O1/O2 gene superfamily and possess cysteine framework VI/VII. While, the cysteine patterns show a similarity to omega conotoxins, the three C. amadis peptides are highly negatively charged and possess a significant content of hydrophobic residues.

AB Microcystins-LR (MC-LR) is a cyanotoxin produced by cyanobacteria. We evaluated the antioxidant potential of LASSBio-596 (LB-596, inhibitor of phosphodiesterases 4 and 5), per os, and biochemical markers involved in lung and liver injury induced by exposure to sublethal dose of MC-LR. Fifty male Swiss mice received an intraperitoneal injection of 60 mu L of saline (CTRL group, n = 20) or a sublethal dose of MC-LR (40 mu g/kg, TOX group, n = 20). After 6 h the animals received either saline (TOX and CTRL groups) or LB 596 (50 mg/kg, TOX + LASS group, n = 10) by gavage. At 6 h after exposure, respiratory mechanics was evaluated in 10 CTRL and 10 TOX mice: there was a significant increase of all lung mechanics parameters (static elastance, viscoelastic component of elastance and lung resistive and viscoelastic/inhomogeneous pressures) in TOX compared to CTRL. 8 h after saline or MC-LR administration, i.e., 2 h after treatment with LB-596, blood serum levels of alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase, activity of superoxide dismutase, catalase, and content of malondialdehyde and carbonyl in lung and liver, NADPH oxidase 2 and 4 mRNA expressions, dual oxidase enzyme activity and H2O2 generation were analyzed in lung homogenates. All parameters were significantly higher in TOX than in the other groups. There was no significant difference between CTRL and TOX + LASS. MC-LR deteriorated lung and liver functions and induced redox imbalance in them, which was prevented by oral administration of LB-596. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Scorpion venoms comprise cocktails of proteins, peptides, and other molecules used for immobilizing prey and deterring predators. The composition and efficacy of scorpion venoms appears to be taxon-specific due to a coevolutionary arms race with prey and predators that adapt at the molecular level. The taxon-specific components of scorpion venoms can be used as barcodes for species identification if the amount of intraspecific variation is low and the analytical method is fast, inexpensive and reliable. The present study assessed the extent of intraspecific variation in newly regenerated venom collected in the field from geographically separated populations of four southern African scorpion species: three buthids, Parabuthus granulatus (Ehrenberg, 1831), Uroplectes otjimbinguensis (Karsch, 1879), and Uroplectes planimanus (Karsch, 1879), and one scorpionid, Opistophthalmus carinatus (Peters, 1861). Although ion signal patterns were generally similar among venom samples of conspecific individuals from different populations, MALDI-TOF mass spectra in the mass range m/z 700-10,000 revealed only a few ion signals that were identical suggesting that species identification based on simple venom mass fingerprints (MFPs) will be more reliable if databases contain data from multiple populations. In general, hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) of the ion signals in mass spectra was more reliable for species identification than counts of mass-identical substances in MFPs. The statistical approach revealed conclusive information about intraspecific diversity. In combination with a comprehensive database of MALDI-TOF mass spectra in reflectron mode, HCA may offer a method for rapid species identification based on venom MFPs. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The global need for accurate and sensitive quantitation of microcystins (MCs) persists as incidents of cyanobacterial harmful algal blooms continue to rise and recent research reveals an underestimation of the human health implications of these toxins. An optimal approach for their accurate quantitation relies on the availability of stable isotope-labeled MC standards for use in stable isotope dilution analysis (SIDA) strategies involving liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Due to the dearth of isotopically labeled MCs, ten different N-15-enriched MCs were biosynthesized from producing cultures and fully characterized. This involved the comparative MS/MS fragmentation of natural abundance or unlabeled metabolites with their N-15-labeled congeners for improved confidence in product ion annotation. These results revealed a series of incorrect annotations described previously in the literature. in this manuscript, the biosynthesis of labeled microcystin is detailed, and their complete analytical characterization for prospective use in targeted SIDA applications, such as routine water testing is described.

AB Lipid peroxidation, glutathione content, glutathione peroxidase activity and gene expression of transcription factors, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione synthetase and glutathione reductase was investigated in common carp liver. Short term (24 h) exposure of aflatoxin B-1 at different doses (100, 200 and 400 mu g AFB(1) kg(-1) feed) was used. It was found that conjugated dienes and trienes elevated after 16 h, while thiobarbituric acid reactive substances content increased only at the lowest dose after 16 and 24 h of exposure. Glutathione content showed higher levels than control after 16 h of exposure and glutathione peroxidase (GPx4) activity was higher in all of the AFB(1) treated than the control group after 8 h of exposure. Gene expression of transcription factors showed dual response. Expression of keap1 gene down-regulated after 8 h and 16 h and nrf2 gene after16 h, but up-regulated after 24 h of exposure in the lowest, and highest dose groups. Expression of gpx4a and gpx4b genes down-regulated after 8 h and induction was found after 16 and 24 h of exposure, irrespective of the dose. The results indicated that low dose of AFB(1) provokes oxidative stress earlier than higher doses, which activated the Keap1-Nrf2 pathway. At higher doses this pathway activated later, but preformed GPx4 effectively prevented lipid peroxidation. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Pure tetragonal-phased Ca0.9MoO4:0.1Eu(3+) (CaMoO4:Eu3+) microcrystals with varying particle sizes were prepared via a co-deposition in water/oil (w/o) phase method. The particle sizes of as-prepared samples were controlled by calcination temperature and calcination time, and the crystallinity of the samples enhances with increasing particle size. The luminescence properties of CaMoO4:Eu3+ microcrystals were studied with varying particle size. The results reveal that the intensity of emission spectra of the CaMoO4:Eu3+ samples increases with increasing particle size, and they have closely correlation with each other. It is the same with the luminescence lifetime. The luminescence lifetime of the CaMoO4:Eu3+ samples decreases from 0.637 ms to 0.447 ms with increasing particle size from 0.12 mu m to 1.79 mu m, respectively. This study not only provides information for size-dependent luminescence properties of CaMoO4:Eu3+ but also gives a reference for potential applications in high voltage electric porcelain material.

AB Plasma electrolytic oxidation was used for synthesis of Eu3+ doped monoclinic HfO2 coatings on hafnium substrate. Results of photoluminescence (PL) measurements show the existence of two distinct regions: one that is related to the blue emission originating from oxygen vacancy defects in HfO2 and the other one characterized with a series of sharp orange-red emission peaks related to f-f transitions of Eu3+ from excited level D-5(0) to lower levels F-7(j) (j = 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4). PL peaks appearing in excitation spectra of obtained coatings are attributed either to charge transfer state of Eu3+ or to direct excitation of the Eu3+ ground state F-7(0) into higher levels of the 4f-manifold. PL of formed coatings increases with PEO time due to an increase of oxygen vacancy defects and the content of Eu3+. Acquired experimental data suggest that hypersensitive electrical dipole transition is much more intense than the magnetic dipole transition, indicating that Eu3+ ions occupy a non-inversion symmetry sites.

AB We have investigated optical spectra of uncolored and electrolytically-colored NaCI:Ag+ and KCI:Ag+ crystals at low temperatures. In the uncolored crystals, the several absorption bands due to the 4d(10) -> 4d(9)5s transitions in Ag+ ions are observed in the energy region below the absorption edge of the host crystals. When the uncolored crystals are electrolytically colored, the absorption bands due to the Ag+ centers decrease and the C absorption band due to Ag- centers appears with the compensation for the decrease of the absorption bands due to the Ag+ centers. The fact implies that the conversion from the Ag+ to Ag- centers occurs through the electrolytic coloration. In the crystals with the Ag+ concentration below about 10(18) cm(-3), the conversion efficiency from the Ag+ to Ag centers reached more than 60%. The conversion processes from the Ag+ to Ag centers are discussed. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The Co-implanted silicon layers with rapid thermal process (RTP) have been prepared for intermediate band materials. The characterization of the Si:Co layer has been analyzed and discussed. The results show that the Co concentrations in effective implanted region of the Si layers exceed the Mott limit, satisfying the requirement for the formation of intermediate band in silicon. The Co-implanted samples are well crystallized by RTP treatment. The effective lifetime of the carriers in the samples increases with the Co dose implanted. This indicates that the non-radiative recombination has been suppressed in the post annealed samples. Furthermore, the optical absorptance of the samples is much enhanced in the wavelength range of above 1100 nm. It can be concluded that the Si:Co layer can be prepared by Co implantation in Si followed by RTP method, and it is a promising material that can be used for intermediate band solar cells.

AB Trivalent Nd and Yb co-doped rod shaped hexagonal phase fluorapatite (FAP) nanoparticles of length and width about 32 and 13 nm, respectively were prepared by hydrothermal method and investigated the ability for 980 nm emission via Nd3+ -> Yb3+ energy transfer with the objective of utilizing them in biomedical imaging. Nd3+ -> Yb3+ energy transfer in FAP was studied as a function of both Nd3+ and Yb3+ concentrations and found that when Yb3+ concentration was 10 mol% the FAP phase has partially turned in to YbPO4 phase. The Yb3+ emission intensity at 980 nm significantly increased up to 5 mol% Yb3+ doping and then reduced drastically for further increase in its concentration. Nd3+ -> +Yb3+ energy transfer rates were evaluated from the decay curves and found that a transfer rate of 71% for 2 mol% Nd3+ co-doped with 5 mol% Yb3+. The cytocompatibility test with fibroblast like cells using MTT assay revealed that the nanoparticles are compatible with the cells. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Herein, we reported the characterization of a highly fluorescent and sensitive amorphous nanodots synthesized by hydrothermal treatment of citric acid in the presence of various beta-amines below 200 degrees C. Five-membered ring fused 2-pyridone compounds are effectively produced in the condensation reaction, and serve as the main building blocks to self-assemble into supramolecular nanodots under hydrogen bonding. The 2-pyridone compounds are not the sole blue species, but effectively enhance the photoluminescence quantum yield of citric acid derived nanodots. Compared with the excitation-independent emission in dilute solution, the dense nanodots exhibit red-shifted, suppressed and unexpected excitation-dependent emission. Moreover, the supramolecular nanodots have high sensitivity in various ambient conditions, such as pH, solvent polarity and metal ions. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Luminescent polymer-rare earth complexes are an important class of photoluminescence and electro-luminescence materials. Via molecular design, two furfural-based bidentate Schiff base ligands, furfural-aniline (FA) type ligand and furfural-cyclohexylamine (FC) type ligand, were bonded on the side chains of polysulfone (PSF), respectively, forming two functionalized macromolecules, PSF-FA and PSF-FC. And then through respective coordination reactions of the two functionalized macromolecules with Eu(III) ion and Tb(III) ion, novel luminescent binary and ternary (with 1,10-phenanthroline as the second ligand) polymer-rare earth complexes were synthesized. For these complexes, on basis of the characterization of their chemical structures, they photoluminescence properties were main researched, and the relationship between their luminescent properties and structures was explored. The experimental results show that the complexes coming from PSF-FA and Eu(III) ion including binary and ternary complexes emit strong red luminescence, indicating that the bonded bidentate Schiff base ligand FA can sensitize the fluorescence emission of Eu(III) ion. While the complexes coming from PSF-FC and Tb(III) ion produce green luminescence, displaying that the bonded bidentate Schiff base ligand FC can sensitize the fluorescence emission of Tb(III) ion. The fluorescence emission intensities of the ternary complexes were stronger than that of binary complexes, reflecting the important effect of the second ligand. The fluorescence emission of the solid film of complexes is much stronger than that of the solutions of complexes. Besides, by comparison, it is found that the furfural (as a heteroaromatic compound)-based Schiff base type polymer-rare earth complexes have stronger fluorescence emission and higher energy transfer efficiency than salicylaldehyde (as a common aromatic compound) -based Schiff base type polymer-rare earth complexes.

AB The luminescence and radiative properties of the Eu-doped borate glasses with Li2B4O7, CaB4O7, and LiCaBO3 basic compositions have been investigated and analysed. The borate glasses of high chemical purity and optical quality, doped with Eu2O3 in amounts of 0.5 and 1.0 mol. % were obtained from the corresponding polycrystalline compounds in the air atmosphere using standard glass synthesis technology. The spectroscopic and radiative properties of obtained Eu-doped glasses were studied using electron paramagnetic resonance (ERR), optical absorption, photoluminescence (excitation and emission spectra, decay kinetics) techniques, and modified Judd-Ofelt analysis. The photoluminescence spectra of the Eu-doped borate glasses reveal intense emission bands, which correspond to the D-5(0) -> F-7(j) (j = 0 divided by 4) transitions of Eu3+ ions. The observed luminescence decay curves are satisfactory described in the framework of single exponential approximation with lifetimes, which lie in the 2.04 divided by 2.26 ms range. The Judd-Ofelt intensity parameters (QA) for Eu3+ centres in the investigated glasses were calculated from their luminescence emission spectra. Radiative lifetimes and internal quantum efficiencies were estimated for observed emission transitions of the Eu3+ centres in the investigated glasses. External quantum yield of luminescence was measured experimentally via an absolute method. The high calculated internal quantum efficiency (similar to 50%) and relatively high measured external quantum yield (similar to 11%) of the Eu3+ luminescence show that the Li2B4O7:Eu, CaB4O7:Eu, and LiCaBO3:Eu glasses belong to perspective luminescent materials.

AB Laterally-coupled SU-8 ridge waveguide-based micro-ring resonator was designed, fabricated and characterized for optical filtering applications. Fabrication was done by optical lithography using a patterned chrome mask of SU-8 ridge waveguide and micro-ring resonator structures, which was replicated onto a plasma enhanced chemical vapour deposited (PECVD) silicon-dioxide layer on a silicon wafer. Optical characterization showed that the fabricated micro-ring resonator had a free spectral range (FSR) of similar to 16 nm for a ring radius of 15 mu m in TE polarization. A simple semiconductor laser diode and a monochromator were used for the characterization of the device. The measured through port and drop port light output for different wavelengths indicate that the device can be used as an optical filter around 1565 nm centre wavelength, with a 3 dB bandwidth of 5.3 nm and an extinction ratio of similar to 10.5 dB.

AB Reflection loss is essential factor to limit the efficiency of all of photovoltaic devices. Glass substrate that with no trapping mechanism to reduce the reflection of light as most CdTe commercial thin film solar cells are manufactured. The absorption band gap of CdTe devices is 387-850 nm, to minimize the losses, a broadband anti-reflection coating that its transmittance must as high as possible at 390-850 nm is designed with TFCALC modeling software and deposited with sol-gel method and dip-coatings technique on both sides of the glass substrate. See from the transmittance spectrum of broadband anti-reflection coatings (BARCs) is more than 98% at the band of 390-870 nm which is the same as the band gap of CdTe photovoltaic cells and its maximum transmittance is 99.70%. In addition to matched band and high transmittance, the durability of BARCs is crucial for applying on CdTe devices. It presents that BARCs that uses trimethyl chlorosilane (TMCS) to optimize the hydrophilic of the surface of BARCs is relatively stable from the examination of Contact angle and Environmental include damp heat, ultraviolet radiation and light-tact. The BARCs can well apply on CdTe modules that the optical property of BARCs is not affected by the preparation process of CdTe solar cell with simulation. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB We report the synthesis of Pure and Gd doped NiWZO(4) nanoparticles by chemical precipitation technique with excellent linear and nonlinear optical properties. The significant effects of Gd doping on optical, structural, morphological and magnetic properties have been investigated by UV-Vis spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD), Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and Vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM) techniques. XRD pattern for pure and Gd doped NiWO4 demonstrates the wolframite monoclinic structure and the crystallite size decreases with increase in Gd concentration as confirmed by SEM. Magnetic hysteresis (MH) curves from the VSM measurement have shown excellent ferromagnetic nature of the nanostructures at room temperature. The nonlinear optical properties of NiWO4 nanoparticles investigated using Z-scan technique demonstrate that the nanoparticles with increasing Gd have shown excellent nonlinear optical behavior. The nanoparticles clearly exhibit a negative value of nonlinear refraction, which is attributed to the two photon absorption (2PA) and free carrier absorption. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

The excitation and emission spectra of Y7(1-m-n)Bi7mDy7nO6F9 (m = 0.01, n = 0; m = 0, n = 0.01; m = 0.01, n = 0.01) were investigated using photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy. Critical emission quenching, as a function of B3+ or Dy3+ contents in Y7O6F9, was similarly observed at relatively low concentrations of both the activators. The dependence of the luminescent intensity of the Dy3+ co-doped (n = 0-0.1) host lattices on the Bi3+ content (m = 0.01) was also studied. Co-doping Dy3+ into the Bi3+-doped host structure enabled high energy transfer from Bi3+ to Dy3+; this energy transfer mechanism is discussed. Furthermore, the Y3+ ions in the lattice were replaced by Eu3+ ions in Y7(1-m-n)Bi7mDy7nO6F9 (m = 0.01, n = 0.01), and the diverse emission spectra by the energy-transfer and cooperation of Bi3+, Dy3+, and Eu3+ transitions and color Commission Internationale de l'Eclairage (CIE) coordinates were obtained. With these phosphors, the desired CIE values including emissions throughout blue, green, white, and red color regions of the spectra were achieved. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Silver nanoparticles (NPs) were embedded into Er3+/Yb3+ co-doped phosphate glasses prepared using melt-quenching technique. Detailed structure and optical characterizations have been carried out. Homogeneous distribution of spherical Ag NPs is shown from the transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The EDX analysis spectrum shows the presence of Ag element. The observed surface plasmon resonance (SPR) band of Ag NPs appears in the range 420-570 nm.
   The influence of Ag NPs on the fluorescence of Er3+ under the excitation of 488 nm was investigated. The fluorescence increased with the increasing of Ag NPs concentration which is attributed to the enhanced local electric field around Er3+ induced by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) effect of silver NPs. However, the increase in the Ag NPs concentration reduces the luminescence intensity due to the quenching effect which is attributed to the energy transfer from Er3+ and Yb3+ ions to silver NPs.
   The blue, green and red up conversion emissions were observed and the effect of the Ag NPs on the up conversion enhancement was investigated. The influence of the temperature on the PL intensity and the PL lifetime of PEr05Y1Ag1.5 glass sample were studied in the temperature range of 20-220 K. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Glasses with composition (70-x) P2O3-17.5PbO-10Ga(2)O(3)-2.5Pr(2)O(3):xBi(2)O(3) (0 <= x <= 7) were prepared by conventional melt quenching technique. The prepared glasses were characterized by their XRD patterns. Various spectroscopic studies like FTIR, optical absorption and photoluminescence were carried out on these glasses. The optical absorption spectra exhibited eight absorption bands around 444, 468, 481, 590, 1012, 1424, 1528 and 1941 nm wavelengths corresponding to transitions H-3(4) -> P-3(2), P-3(1), P-3(0,) D-1(2) (1)G(4). F-3(4), F-3(3) and F-3(2) respectively. In addition to the above, the optical absorption spectra have also exhibited additional band at about 444 nm due to the addition of Bi2O3 to the host glass and is ascribed to the S-1(0) -> P-3(1) transition of Bi3+ ions. J-O intensity parameters computed from the absorption spectra of the samples by using modified J-O theory exhibited the order Omega(2)>Omega(6)>Omega(4). Emission spectra of the prepared glasses were recorded at excitation wavelength 444 nm. The luminescence intensity of Pr3+ ions is found to increase with an increase in the concentration of Bi2O3 up to S mol% beyond this concentration decreasing trend in it is noticed. Such observed hike in the intensity of luminescence of Pr3+ ions might be due to the occurrence of energy transfer between Pr3+ and Bi3+ ions. Chromaticity color coordinates for all the glass samples were evaluated. Decay curves of all the glass samples exhibit double exponential behavior. Significant energy transfer parameters viz., the luminescence quantum efficiency (eta(Q)), energy transfer efficiency (eta(ET)), energy transfer parameter (Q), energy transfer probability (P-DA) and critical transfer parameter (R-0) were evaluated for all the titled glasses by using the life time values. From the investigated spectroscopic studies and evaluated energy transfer parameter values it can be seen that the glass sample mixed with 5 mol% of Bi2O3 is a good host that can emit bright reddish - orange laser.

AB Silica layers fabricated by the sol-gel method are usually amorphous and exhibit a relatively low refractive index (n similar to 1.46 at about 0.6 mu m), high optical transmittances at UV-VIS and near-IR ranges, as well as high thermal stability. Such layers can be used as high reflection or antireflection coatings, dielectric mirrors, bandpass filters, etc. However, crack-free layers with a maximum thickness of about 400 nm can be prepared in one coating cycle from sols of simple silicon alkoxides. This paper presents an approach for the preparation of crack-free silica layers that allows us to increase this maximum thickness. The approach is based on the dip-coating technique used for applying stable silica sols containing fumed silica. These sols were obtained from input silica sols based on tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) with concentrations 1 and 2 mol/l, ethanol, HCl and water (RW 1.75). Fumed silica was dispersed in water/TritonX-100 solution and added into some of the input sols. Zeta potentials, average dimensions and diffusion coefficients of silica agglomerates in sols containing fumed silica are presented. Both types of sols were deposited onto silica slides and silicon wafers by the dip-coating technique using different withdrawing velocities 100,200 and 300 mm/min. Prepared silica gel layers were thermally treated at 450 or 900 degrees C. One of silica sols with fumed silica has also been used for the preparation of a silica-titania sol with a molar ratio Ti/Si = 3/7. Both these sols have been employed for the preparation of a Bragg mirror consisting of three pairs of high-index silica-titania and low index silica layers on a silica slide.
   The appearance and thickness of prepared single silica and silica-titania layers have been characterized by optical microscopy and scanning electron microscopy. Optical properties of layers have been determined by spectral ellipsometry and UV-VIS-NIR transmission spectrometry. The measurements have shown that characteristics of layers fabricated from both types of the sols differ and that one can obtain stable transparent silica layers with thicknesses up to 650 nm and refractive indices in a range from 1.41 to 1.44 at 600 nm using TEOS sols containing fumed silica. It has been found that larger layer thicknesses can be achieved by using silica sols with fumed silica, by increasing the alkoxide concentration, by using increased withdrawing velocities, and by decreasing heat-treatment temperatures.

X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, inductively coupled plasma and spectrofluorimeter equipments are used to characterize the samples. By introducing Bi3+ into Ln(3+):GdVO4, efficient energy transfer occurs from Bi3+-V5+ charge transfer state to Ln(3+), these phosphors can efficiently absorb near-ultraviolet light through the Bi3+-V5+ metal metal couple charge transfer and exhibit intense multifarious luminescent colors by modulating the doping content of Ln(3+) ions. Therefore they have potential applications in color display field. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Synthesized molecules have been characterized by standard spectroscopic techniques in order to confirm their structural traits. The solvatochromic behavior of molecules MI to M5 in solvents of varying polarity were investigated by UV-Vis, fluorescence spectroscopy and supported by TD-DFT calculations. DFT studies performed in the gas phase confirmed the energy stabilized structure of the molecules M1 to M5. Structural characteristics of molecule M2 favored higher fluorescence emission with a quantum yield of 0.35 and a solid-state emission of 512 nm. Fluorescence lifetime measurement of the molecules M1 to M5 exhibited a lifetime of order 2-5 ns. Overall, molecule M2 can find its application in organic light emitting diodes as a non-dopant emitter material. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The scintillation and optical properties of ceramic samples were investigated by means of time-resolved luminescence spectroscopy. We measured radioluminescence, photoluminescence excitation and emission spectra as well as luminescence decays excited by UV and soft X-rays, respectively. Multiple annealing was employed to optimize ceramic performance. Furthermore, optical properties of powder and ceramic sample of the same composition were compared.

It was found that doping Si4+ into TAG was conductive to remove the porosity and improve the optical quality of TAG ceramics significantly. The TAG ceramic sample with 0.2at% Si4+ doping (S1) has the highest transmittance among the samples, which can reach 80% in the 1000-1500nm region and it also has the largest grain size of 42.9 mu m. No pores and impurity phase were found within the grains or along the boundary. The Verdet constant of sample S1 was measured and the value at 633nm was 173.46 rad/Tm, which was similar with that of pure TAG crystal and 29% higher than that of TGG crystal. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB In this study, Nd:YAG ceramics with different (Nd+Y)/AI ratios around the stoichiometric one ((Nd+Y)/Al = 0.6000) with high accuracy (better than 0.1%) were elaborated by solid-state reactive-sintering under vacuum. The influence of (Nd-FY)/AI ratio on sintering behavior, microstructural and optical properties of as-obtained ceramics were systematically studied. This study shows that Al-excess strongly promotes mass transfer by diffusion, and consequently, densification and grain growth processes whereas Y-excess lead to opposite behavior. Results were interpreted by considering several parameters such as local chemical composition, intrinsic/extrinsic crystalline defects, and interactions between pores, secondary phases and grain boundaries. Finally, exact stoichiometry or Y-excess appear to be more favorable to obtain highly transparent Nd:YAG ceramics suitable for laser operation. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this study, the inclusion complex formation between a-mangostin and water-soluble quaternized beta-CD grafted-chitosan (QCD-g-CS) was investigated. Inclusion complex formation with encapsulation efficiency (%EE) of 5, 15 and 75% can be varied using high speed homogenizer. Tuning %EE plays a role on physicochemical and biological properties of a-mangostin/QCD-g-CS complex. Molecular dynamics simulations indicate that alpha-mangostin is included within the hydrophobic beta-CD cavity and being absorbed on the QCD-g-CS surface, with these results being confirmed by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. Probing the release characteristics of the inclusion complex at various %EE (5%, 15% and 75%) in simulated saliva (pH 6.8) demonstrated that a-mangostin release rates were dependent on % EE (order 5% > 15% > 75%). Additionally, higher antimicrobial and anti-inflammation activities were observed for the inclusion complex than those of free a-mangostin due to enhance the solubility of a-mangostin through the inclusion complex with QCD-g-CS.

AB The in-vitro aerosol performance of two combination dry powder inhaler (DPI) products, Foster (R) NEXThaler (R) and Seretide (R) Diskus (R) were investigated with single particle aerosol mass spectrometry (SPAMS). The in-vitro pharmaceutical performance is markedly different for both inhalers. Foster (R) NEXThaler (R) generates a higher fine particle fraction (FPF < 5 mu m) and a much higher relative extra fine particle fraction (eFPF < 2 mu m). In terms of the composition of the aerodynamic particle size distribution (APSD), it could be verified with SPAMS that overall Foster (R) NEXThaler (R) emits a significantly higher number of fine and extra fine particles with a median aerodynamic diameter (MAD) of 2.1 mu m while Seretide (R) Diskus (R) had a larger MAD of 3.1 mu m. Additionally, the interactions between the two active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) in both products are different. While Seretide (R) Diskus (R) emits a significant (37%) number of co-associated API particles, only a negligible number of co-associated API particles were found in Foster (R) NEXThaler (R) (< 1%). A major difference with Foster (R) NEXThaler (R) is that it contains magnesium stearate (MgSt) as a second excipient besides lactose in a so-called 'dual excipient' platform. The data generated using SPAMS suggested that nearly all of the beclomethasone dipropionate particles in Foster (R) NEXThaler (R) also contain MgSt and must therefore be co-associated with this additional excipient. This may help explain why beclomethasone dipropionate in Foster (R) NEXThaler (R) forms less particle co-associations with the second API, formoterol fumarate, shows a lower cohesive strength in respect to beclomethasone itself and why both APIs exhibit superior detachment from the carrier as evidenced by the increased eFPF and smaller MAD.

AB Au-methotrexate (Au-MTX) conjugates induced by sugar molecules were produced by a simple, one-pot, hydrothermal growth method. Herein, the Au(III)-MTX complexes were used as the precursors to form Au-MTX conjugates. Addition of different types of sugar molecules with abundant hydroxyl groups resulted in the formation of Au-MTX conjugates featuring distinct characteristics that could be explained by the diverse capping mechanisms of sugar molecules. That is, the instant-capping mechanism of glucose favored the generation of peanut-like Au-MTX conjugates with high colloidal stability while the post-capping mechanism of dextran and sucrose resulted in the production of Au-MTX conjugates featuring excellent near-infrared (NIR) optical properties with a long-wavelength plasmon resonance near 630-760 nm. Moreover, in vitro bioassays showed that cancer cell viabilities upon incubation with free MTX, Au-MTX conjugates doped with glucose, dextran and sucrose for 48 h were 74.6%, 55.0%, 62.0%, and 63.1%, respectively. Glucose-doped Au-MTX conjugates exhibited a higher anticancer activity than those doped with dextran and sucrose, therefore potentially presenting a promising treatment platform for anticancer therapy. Based on the present study, this work may provide the first example of using biocompatible sugars as regulating agents to effectively guide the shape and assembly behavior of Au-MTX conjugates. Potentially, the synergistic strategy of drug molecules and sugar molecules may offer the possibility to create more gold-based nanocarriers with new shapes and beneficial features for advanced anticancer therapy.

ID DESFERRIOXAMINE
AB Deferoxamine (DFO) to treat iron overload (IO) has been limited by toxicity issues and short circulation times and it would be desirable to prolong circulation to improve non-transferrin bound iron (NTBI) chelation. In addition, DFO is currently unable to efficiently target the large pool of iron in the liver and spleen. Nanogel-Deferoxamine conjugates (NG-DFO) can prove useful as a model to investigate the pharmacokinetic (PK) properties and biodistribution (BD) behavior of iron-chelating macromolecules and their overall effect on serum ferritin levels. NG-DFO reduced the cytotoxicity of DFO and significantly reduced cellular ferritin levels in IO macrophages in vitro. PK/BD studies in normal rats revealed that NG-DFO displayed prolonged circulation and preferential accumulation into the liver and spleen. IO mice treated with NG1-DFO presented significantly lower levels of serum ferritin compared to DFO. Total renal and fecal elimination data point to the need to balance prolonged circulation with controlled degradation to accelerate clearance of iron-chelating macromolecules.

AB Liquid vaccine formulations present some disadvantages such as stability problems, cold chain requirement or administration by trained personnel. Vaccine formulated as tablets would present a wide range of progress such as an increase stability that would facilitate the administration, the distribution and the storage of vaccine formulations. This work investigates the possibility to develop a mucosal tablet vaccine for human influenza viruses. The tablets were tested in vitro for biological efficacy and stability and in vivo in swine as a model for influenza A virus immunity. First, the ability to produce by compaction a stable vaccine with a preserved antigen was demonstrated. In a second part, vaccine tablets were used to immunize pigs. After positioning the tablets on the buccal mucosa, the animals were challenged by inoculation of the A/H1N1 pandemic virus. The responses were compared to those observed in animals vaccinated intramuscularly with the commercial liquid vaccine. It was observed signs of priming of the pig's immune system with vaccine tablets, even if the immune response stayed lower than vaccination by intramuscular route. Thus, we present attractive results that indicate a promising potential for mucosal vaccine tablets

AB Water wettability of pharmaceutical blends affects important quality attributes of final products. We investigate the wetting properties of a pharmaceutical blend lubricated with Magnesium Stearate (MgSt) as a function of the mechanical shear strain applied to the blend. We measure the penetration dynamics of sessile drops deposited on slightly compressed powder beds. We consider a blend composed of 9% Acetaminophen 90% Lactose and 1% MgSt by weight. Comparing the penetration time of water and a reference liquid Polydimethylsiloxane (silicon oil) we obtain an effective cosine of the contact angle with water, based on a recently developed drop penetration method. We repeat the experiments for blends exposed to increasing levels of shear strain and demonstrate a significant decrease in water wettability (decrease in the cosine of the contact angle). The results are consistent with the development of a hydrophobic film coating the powder particles as a result of the increased shear strain. Finally, we show that, as expected dissolution times increase with the level of shear strain. Therefore, the proposed drop penetration method could be used to directly assess the state of lubrication of a pharmaceutical blend and act as a quality control on powder blend attributes before the blend is tableted.

TI Improving release completeness from PLGA-based implants for the

AB The objectives of this study were to assess the feasibility of hot melt extrusion (HME) for the preparation of PLGA-based ovalbumin-loaded implants as well as to characterize and improve protein release from the implants. Ovalbumin (OVA) was stable during extrusion, which was attributed to a protective effect of the biodegradable matrix. OVA release was characterized by a low burst, a slow release up to day 21, which plateaued thereafter resulting in incomplete release for all evaluated protein loadings. Release incompleteness was accompanied by the formation of an insoluble residual mass. Further characterization of this mass indicated that it consisted of non-covalent protein aggregates and polymer, where ovalbumin was ionically bound as the pH inside the degrading matrix decreased below the pI of the protein. Although higher protein release was obtained with the inclusion of weak bases because of their neutralizing effect, OVA aggregation and release incompleteness were not fully avoided. With the use of shellac, a well-known enteric and biocompatible polymer, as protective excipient, a distinct late release phase occurred and release completeness was increased to more than 75% cumulative release. Shellac apparently protected the protein against the acidic microclimate due to its low solubility at low pH. Protected OVA was thus released once the pH increased due to a declining PLGA-oligomer formation. The result was a triphasic release profile consisting of an initial burst, a slow diffusion phase over about 7 weeks, and an erosion-controlled dissolution phase over the next 3 weeks. An acid-labile protein like OVA was thus feasibly protected from interactions with PLGA and its degradation products, resulting in a controlled delivery of more than 85% of the original payload.

AB Commonly used characterization techniques such as cryogenic-transmission electron microscopy (cryo-TEM) and batch-mode dynamic light scattering (DLS) are either time consuming or unable to offer high resolution to discern the poly-dispersity of complex drug products like cyclosporine ophthalmic emulsions. Here, a size-based separation and characterization method for globule size distribution using an asymmetric flow field flow fractionation (AF4) is reported for comparative assessment of cyclosporine ophthalmic emulsion drug products (model formulation) with a wide size span and poly-dispersity. Cyclosporine emulsion formulations that are qualitatively (Q1) and quantitatively (Q2) the same as Restasis (R) were prepared in house with varying manufacturing processes and analyzed using the optimized AF4 method. Based on our results, the commercially available cyclosporine ophthalmic emulsion has a globule size span from 30 nm to a few hundred nanometers with majority smaller than 100 nm. The results with in-house formulations demonstrated the sensitivity of AF4 in determining the differences in the globule size distribution caused by the changes to the manufacturing process. It is concluded that the optimized AF4 is a potential analytical technique for comprehensive understanding of the microstructure and assessment of complex emulsion drug products with high poly-dispersity.

AB The manufacture of immediate release high drug loading paracetamol oral tablets was achieved using an extrusion based 3D printer from a premixed water based paste formulation. The 3D printed tablets demonstrate that a very high drug (paracetamol) loading formulation (80% w/w) can be printed as an acceptable tablet using a method suitable for personalisation and distributed manufacture. Paracetamol is an example of a drug whose physical form can present challenges to traditional powder compression tableting. Printing avoids these issues and facilitates the relatively high drug loading. The 3D printed tablets were evaluated for physical and mechanical properties including weight variation, friability, breaking force, disintegration time, and dimensions and were within acceptable range as defined by the international standards stated in the United States Pharmacopoeia (USP). X-ray Powder Diffraction (XRPD) was used to identify the physical form of the active. Additionally, XRPD, Attenuated Total Reflectance Fourier Transform Infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) were used to assess possible drug-excipient interactions. The 3D printed tablets were evaluated for drug release using a USP dissolution testing type I apparatus. The tablets showed a profile characteristic of the immediate release profile as intended based upon the active/excipient ratio used with disintegration in less than 60 s and release of most of the drug within 5 min. The results demonstrate the capability of 3D extrusion based printing to produce acceptable high-drug loading tablets from approved materials that comply with current USP standards.

AB Proliposome powders were prepared via a slurry method using sorbitol or D-mannitol as carbohydrate carriers in 1: 10 or 1: 15 w/w lipid phase to carrier ratios. Soya phosphatidylcholine (SPC) and cholesterol were employed as a lipid phase and Beclometasone dipropionate (BDP) was incorporated as a model drug. Direct compaction using a Minipress was applied on the lipid-enriched powder in order to manufacture proliposome tablets. Sorbitol-based proliposome tablets in a 1: 15 w/w ratio were found to be the best formulation as it exhibited excellent powder flowability with an angle of repose of 25.62 +/- 1.08 degrees, and when compacted the resultant tablets had low friability (0.20 +/- 0.03%), appropriate hardness (crushing strength) (120.67 +/- 12.04 N), short disintegration time (5.85 +/- 0.66 min), and appropriate weight uniformity. Moreover, upon hydration into liposomes, the entrapment efficiency for sorbitol formulations in both 1: 10 and 1: 15 lipid to carrier ratios were significantly higher (53.82 +/- 6.42% and 57.43 +/- 9.12%) than D-mannitol formulations (39.90 +/- 4.30% and 35.22 +/- 6.50%), respectively. Extended stability testing was conducted for 18 months, at three different temperature conditions (Fridge Temperature (FT; 6 degrees C), Room Temperature (RT; 22 degrees C) and High Temperature (HT; 40 degrees C)) for sorbitol-based proliposome tablets (1: 15 w/w ratio). Volume median diameter (VMD) and zeta potential significantly changed from 5.90 +/- 0.70 mu m to 14.79 +/- 0.79 mu m and from -3.08 +/- 0.26 mV to -11.97 +/- 0.26 mV respectively at month 18, when samples were stored under HT conditions. Moreover, the entrapment efficiency of BDP decreased from 57.43 +/- 9.12% to 17.93 +/- 5.37% following 18 months storage under HT conditions. Overall, in this study for the first time, proliposome tablets were manufactured and thoroughly characterized, and sorbitol showed to be a promising carrier.

The application of nanotechnology associated to human health "nanomedicine" has revolutionized the drug delivery system by providing improved pharmacological and therapeutic properties of drugs. These advantageous effects of drug loaded nanocarrier systems are embraced by the pharmaceutical industries for the development of different effective nanocarriers. Currently, several drug loaded nanoformulations are approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and some of them are undergoing clinical trials for the human use. In this review, we have discussed the progress achieved so far for various drug loaded nanoformulations along with few emerging nanoformulations that are about to enter into clinical trials.

AB The purpose of this research was to study isomalt as a protein-stabilizing excipient with lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) during freeze-drying and subsequent storage and compare it to sucrose, a standard freeze-drying excipient. Four different diastereomer mixtures of isomalt were studied. The stability of the protein was studied with a spectrophotometric enzyme activity test and circular dichroism after freeze-drying and after 21 days of storage at 16% RH. Physical stability was analyzed with differential scanning calorimetry and Karl Fischer titration. Statistical analysis was utilized in result analysis. LDH activity was almost completely retained after freeze-drying with sucrose; whereas samples stabilized with isomalt diastereomer mixtures had a considerably lower protein activity. During storage the sucrose-containing samples lost most of their enzymatic activity, while the isomalt mixtures retained the protein activity better. In all cases changes to protein secondary structure were observed. Isomalt diastereomer mixtures have some potential as protein-stabilizing excipients during freeze-drying and subsequent storage. Isomalt stabilized LDH moderately during freeze-drying; however it performed better during storage. Future studies with other proteins are required to evaluate more generally whether isomalt would be a suitable excipient for pharmaceutical freeze-dried protein formulations.

AB Our current understanding of the structures of vertebrate mineralized tissues is largely based on light microscopy/histology and projections of 3D structures onto 2D planes using electron microscopy. We know little about the fine details of these structures in 3D at the length scales of their basic building blocks, the inherent variations of structure within a tissue and the cell-extracellular tissue interfaces. This limits progress in understanding tissue formation, relating structure to mechanical and metabolic functions, and obtaining deeper insights into pathologies and the evolution of these tissues. In this perspective we identify and discuss a series of open questions pertaining to collagen containing vertebrate mineralized tissues that can be addressed using appropriate 3D structural determination methods. By so doing we hope to encourage more research into the 3D structures of mineralized vertebrate tissues.

AB Macromolecular interactions occur with widely varying affinities. Strong interactions form well defined interfaces but weak interactions are more dynamic and variable. Weak interactions can collectively lead to large structures such as microvilli via cooperativity and are often the precursors of much stronger interactions, e.g. the initial actin-myosin interaction during muscle contraction. Electron tomography combined with subvolume alignment and classification is an ideal method for the study of weak interactions because a 3-D image is obtained for the individual interactions, which subsequently are characterized collectively. Here we describe a method to characterize heterogeneous F-actin-aldolase interactions in 2-D rafts using electron tomography. By forming separate averages of the two constituents and fitting an atomic structure to each average, together with the alignment information which relates the raw motif to the average, an atomic model of each crosslink is determined and a frequency map of contact residues is computed. The approach should be applicable to any large structure composed of constituents that interact weakly and heterogeneously.

AB The community-wide blind prediction of G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) structures and ligand docking has been conducted three times and the quality of the models was primarily assessed by the accuracy of ligand binding modes. The seven transmembrane (TM) helices of the receptors were taken as a whole; thus the model quality within the 7TM domains has not been evaluated. Here we evaluate the 7TM domain structures in the models submitted for the last round of prediction - GPCR Dock 2013. Applying the 7 x 7 RMSD matrix analysis described in our prior work, we show that the models vary widely in prediction accuracy of the 7TM structures, exhibiting diverse structural differences from the targets. For the prediction of the 5-hydroxytryptarnine receptors, the top 7TM models are rather close to the targets, which however are not ranked top by ligand-docking. On the other hand, notable deviations of the TMs are found in in the previously identified top docking models that closely resemble other receptors. We further reveal reasons of success and failure in ligand docking for the models. This current assessment not only complements the previous assessment, but also provides important insights into the current status of GPCR modeling and ligand docking.

AB Shells of brachiopods are excellent archives for environmental reconstructions in the recent and distant past as their microstructure and geochemistry respond to climate and environmental forcings. We studied the morphology and size of the basic structural unit, the secondary layer fibre, of the shells of several extant brachiopod taxa to derive a model correlating microstructural patterns to environmental conditions. Twenty-one adult specimens of six recent brachiopod species adapted to different environmental conditions, from Antarctica, to New Zealand, to the Mediterranean Sea, were chosen for microstructural analysis using SEM, TEM and EBSD. We conclude that: 1) there is no significant difference in the shape and size of the fibres between ventral and dorsal valves, 2) there is an ontogenetic trend in the shape and size of the fibres, as they become larger, wider, and flatter with increasing age. This indicates that the fibrous layer produced in the later stages of growth, which is recommended by the literature to be the best material for geochemical analyses, has a different morphostructure and probably a lower organic content than that produced earlier in life.
   In two species of the same genus living in seawater with different temperature and carbonate saturation state, a relationship emerged between the microstructure and environmental conditions. Fibres of the polar Liothyrella uva tend to be smaller, rounder and less convex than those of the temperate Liothyrella neozelanica, suggesting a relationship between microstructural size, shell organic matter content, ambient seawater temperature and calcite saturation state.

AB Bone quantity and bone quality are important factors in determining the properties and the mechanical functions of bone. This study examined the effects of disrupting bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling through BMP receptors on bone quantity and bone quality. More specifically, we disrupted two BMP receptors, Acvrl and Bmpr1a, respectively, in Osterix-expressing osteogenic progenitor cells in mice. We examined the structural changes to the femora from 3-month old male and female conditional knockout (cKO) mice using micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) and histology, as well as compositional changes to both cortical and trabecular compartments of bone using Raman spectroscopy. We found that the deletion of Acvrl and Bmpr1a, respectively, in an osteoblast-specific manner resulted in higher bone mass in the trabecular compartment. Disruption of Bmpr1a resulted in a more significantly increased bone mass in the trabecular compartment. We also found that these cKO mice showed lower mineral-to-matrix ratio, while tissue mineral density was lower in the cortical compartment. Collagen crosslink ratio was higher in both cortical and trabecular compartments of male cKO mice. Our study suggested that BMP signaling in osteoblast mediated by BMP receptors, namely ACVR1 and BMPR1A, is critical in regulating bone quantity and bone quality.

AB Several gene fusion technologies have been successfully applied to label particular subunits or domains within macromolecular complexes to enable positional mapping of electron microscopy (EM) density maps, but exogenous fusion of a protein domain into the target polypeptide can cause unwanted structural and functional outcomes. Fab fragments from antibodies can be used as labeling reagents during EM visualization without gene manipulation of the target protein, but this method requires a panel of high-affinity antibodies that recognize a wide variety of epitopes. Linear peptide tags and their anti-tag antibodies can be used but they have a limited mapping ability as their placement is usually limited to the terminal regions of a protein. The PA dodecapeptide epitope tag (GVAMPGAEDDVV), forms a tight beta-turn in the antigen binding pocket of its antibody (NZ-1). This capability allows for insertion of the PA tag into various surface-exposed loops within a multi-domain cell adhesion receptor, alpha(IIb)beta(3) integrin. We confirmed that the purified PA-tagged integrin ectodomain fragments can form a stable complex with NZ-1 Fab. Negative stain EM of the various integrin-NZ-1 complexes revealed that a majority of the particles exhibited a clear density corresponding to the NZ-1 Fab; and the positions of the bound Fab were in good agreement with the predicted location of the inserted PA tag. The high-affinity and insertion compatibility of the PA tag system allowed us to develop a new EM labeling methodology applicable to proteins for which good antibodies are not available.

AB Scorpion, as an ancient species, has been widely used on dozens of human diseases in traditional Chinese Medicine. Although the scorpion venom from the Buthidae family with the potent toxicity attracts more interests, toxins from the non-Buthidae family draw great attention as well because of its abundance and complexity even without harm to mammals. Moreover, several toxic components of scorpion venom have been identified as valuable scaffolds for the drug design and development. Using the Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) technique, here we reported the transcriptome of the venomous glands of Heterometrus spinifer, a non-Buthidae scorpion that only a few toxic and complete components have been identified known-to-date. The total mRNA extracted from the venomous glands of H. spinifer was subjected to illumina sequencing with a strategy of de novo assembly, and a total of 54 189 transcripts were unigenes from a total of 88 311 600 determined reads. We annotated 18 567 (34.26%) unigenes from NR database, 12 258 (22.62%) from SWISSPROT database, 11 161 (20.60%) from GO database, 10 159 (18.75%) from COG database and 5059 (9.34%) from KEGG database, respectively. 2843 unigenes were further selected against the toxin-related sub-database of SWISSPROT. After removing the redundancy, 13 common toxin-related subfamilies with 62 unigenes were manually confirmed, including 8 K-toxins, 1 calcin, 3 Imperatoxin I-like, 2 La1-like, 1 scorpin-like, 3 antimicrobial peptides, two types of protease inhibitors such as 8 Kunitz-type protease inhibitors and 3 Ascaris-type protease inhibitors, and 33 proteases including 16 serine proteinases, 7 phospholipases, 5 metalloproteases, 3 hyaluronidases and 2 phosphatases. Our report is the first transcriptomic analyses of venomous glands from the scorpion H. spinifer, serving as a public information platform for the development of novel bio-therapeutics.

AB We report a severe envenoming associated with minimal local symptoms following a Balkan adder (Vipera berus bosniensis) bite in South-Western Hungary. A 63-year-old male with a history of hypertension and sinus bradycardia (45/min) was bitten by a sub-adult specimen of V. b. bosniensis in Somogy County on 04 May 2017. The patient was transported to and treated at the Emergency Department of "Moritz Kaposi" General Hospital, Kaposvar. Locally only pain and minimal swelling with a small haematoma developed on the bitten finger. The abdominal muscles were very tender and guarding was detected upon palpation on the way to hospital. The patient, who had taken his telmisartan (80 mg) tablet in that morning, complained of nausea and dizziness during the first medical examination. The systemic signs included fluctuations in blood pressure (115/85-165/105 mmHg), ECG changes (transient horizontal ST depression in V5-6, and sinus tachycardia (90/min)), severe diarrhoea and vomiting (in 7 episodes). Descending neuromuscular paralysis appeared in the next morning, including complete bilateral ptosis with external ophthalmoplegia, and binocular diplopia. Single-fiber electromyography confirmed the neuromuscular block in the frontalis muscle innervated by the facial nerve. Intense dizziness with uncoordinated movement emerged on the 3rd day. The laboratory findings were mild, including anaemia, hypokalaemia, elevated glutamic-pyruvic transaminase and C-reactive protein levels. The absolute neutrophil count remained almost completely normal. Supportive care and monovalent antivenom (Viper Venom Antitoxin (R), Biomed, Warsaw) were applied. The patient was discharged from hospital on the 4th day, although recovery was not complete until 9 days after the bite. This is the first photographically-documented case of neurotoxic envenoming from the South-Western Hungarian distribution range of V b. bosniensis. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Around 5.5 million people suffer from snakebites per year, with about 400,000 cases with some type of sequelae, such as amputation, and 20,000 to 125,000 cases with the fatal end. Usually, the victim outcome depends on correct, agile and many times in situ intervention based on the proper identification of the snake venom type and its potential effects, among other factors. Therefore, knowledge on the snake venom composition and a research on inhibitors of snake venom target components might ameliorate envenoming dangerous outcome. Herein, two thrombin-like serine proteases from the Crotalus simus snake venom - SVSP1 and SVSP2 - were isolated in two chromatographic steps, using gel filtration and then RP-HPLC. They showed molecular masses of around 31.3 and 24.6 kDa, respectively, and mostly 13-sheet secondary structure features. The SVSP1 and SVSP2 were sequenced using tandem mass spectrometry (Q-TOF). Using the known serine protease structure (ROB entry: 4e7n), which was evaluated as homologous to the two target proteins, in silico docking results showed that hesperetin is its excellent inhibitor. Using in vitro tests with the commercial hesperetin, kinetic parameters were obtained for SVSPs against the synthetic substrate BApNA. Obtained results pointed that hesperetin might act as an uncompetitive (SVSP1) or mixed (SVSP2) inhibitor. Also, the fluorescence quenching upon inhibition was observed, as well as, red shift in maximums of around 20 nm, which indicate that the tryptophan residues in the target enzymes suffered conformational changes caused by hesperetin binding. Thus, a naturally occurring flavone that can easily be extracted from oranges might serve as low-cost inhibitor of the investigated snake venom proteases. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In October 2012, paralytic shellfish toxins (PST) were detected in the hepatopancreas of Southern Rock Lobsters (Jasus edwardsii) collected from the east coast of Tasmania, Australia. This resulted in the first commercial closure in Australia for this species. Questions were raised on how the toxins were transferred to the lobsters, how long the toxins would persist, whether PST-contaminated hepatopancreas posed a risk to human health, and what management strategies could be applied. The aim of this study was to investigate whether PST-contaminated mussels are a potential vector enabling toxin accumulation in J. edwardsii and to collect information on toxin uptake, distribution and depuration rates and toxin profiles under controlled experimental settings. Lobsters were fed mussels naturally contaminated with PST for a period of 28 days in an experimental setting; following this, lobsters were allocated to either fed or starved treatment groups. PST were not detected in the tail tissue of lobsters at any stage of the experiment. Lobster hepatopancreas contained mean levels of 2.4 mg STX.2HCl eq/kg after 28 days of uptake, although substantial variability in total toxicity was observed. The PST profile of the hepatopancreas was similar to that of the contaminated mussels used as feed. Significant differences were noted in the PST depuration rates between fed and starved treatment groups. The daily depuration rate for total PST was estimated to be 0.019 and 0.013 mg STX.2HCl eq/kg for the fed and starved treatment groups respectively using a constant-rate decay model. After 42 days of depuration, total PST (STX equivalents) levels in the hepatopancreas of all lobsters were below 0.8 mg STX.2HCl eq/kg, which represents the regulatory level applied to bivalves. This result indicates that long-term holding to depurate PST may potentially be used as a risk management tool. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The soluble venom from the scorpion Tityus metuendus was characterized by various methods. In vivo experiments with mice showed that it is lethal. Extended electrophysiological recordings using seven sub-types of human voltage gated sodium channels (hNav1.1 to 1.7) showed that it contains both alpha- and beta-scorpion toxin types. Fingerprint analysis by mass spectrometry identified over 200 distinct molecular mass components. At least 60 sub-fractions were recovered from HPLC separation. Five purified peptides were sequenced by Edman degradation, and their complete primary structures were determined. Additionally, three other peptides have had their N-terminal amino acid sequences determined by Edman degradation and reported. Mass spectrometry analysis of tryptic digestion of the soluble venom permitted the identification of the amino acid sequence of 111 different peptides. Search for similarities of the sequences found indicated that they probably are: sodium and potassium channel toxins, metalloproteinases, hyaluronidases, endothelin and angiotensin-converting enzymes, bradykinin-potentiating peptide, hypothetical proteins, allergens, other enzymes, other proteins and peptides.

AB beta-N-methylamino-L-alanine (BMAA) has been shown to accumulate in organisms by associating with host proteins. It has been proposed that this association is the result of misincorporation of BMAA into the primary structure of proteins, specifically in the place of L-serine, and that this misincorporation causes protein misfolding resulting in the tangle formation typically associated with neurodegenerative diseases. However, more recent studies have questioned the validity of the BMAA misincorporation hypothesis. Furthermore, BMAA association with proteins in the absence of de novo protein synthesis has been demonstrated although the nature of these associations has not yet been characterized. We therefore sought to investigate the effects of these undescribed interactions on protein functioning, and to identify the site(s) of these interactions. We present data here to show that BMAA can inhibit the activity of certain enzymes, interfere with protein folding in the absence of de novo protein synthesis, and associate in vitro with commercial proteins to such an extent that it cannot be removed by protein precipitation or denaturation. Based on the observed effects of these interactions on protein functioning, we suggest that this might constitute an additional mechanism of toxicity that could help to explain the role of BMAA in the development of neurodegenerative diseases.

We have previously isolated a Nostoc strain (NR1) from the Nile River (the main water supply in Egypt) and this strain exerted production of rare and highly toxic MC; demethylated microcystin-LR. There is no data concerning risk factors of liver diseases for human and animal exposure to NR1-contaminated drinking water yet. It is thus important to evaluate acute (LD50 dose), subacute (0.01% and 10% of LD50 dose) and subchronic (0.01% and 10% of LD50 dose) hepatotoxicity's NR1 extract using experimental mice. Mice groups, who orally received 0.01% LD50, represented a permissible concentration of the World Health Organization (WHO) for MC in drinking water. Several parameters were detected, including hepatotoxicity (i.e. PP activity, liver function, oxidative stress markers and DNA fragmentation), pro-inflammatory cytokine (TNF-alpha) and liver histopathology. Our results demonstrated LD50 of NR1 extract was at 15,350 mg/kg body weight and caused hepatotoxicity that attributed to PP inhibition and a significant increase of hepatic damage biomarkers with lipid accumulation. Moreover, NR1 extract induced hepatic oxidative damage that may have led to DNA fragmentation and production of TNF-alpha. As demonstrated from the histopathological study, NR1 extract caused a severe collapse of cytoskeleton with subsequent focal degeneration of hepatocytes, necroinflammation and steatosis. The grade of hepatotoxicity in subacute (10% of LD50) group was higher than that in the subchronic (10% of LD50 and 0.01% of LD50, WHOch, respectively) groups. No significant hepatotoxicity was detectable for subacute (0.01% of LD50, WHOac) group. NR1 is therefore considered as one of the harmful and life-threatening cyanobacteria for Egyptian people being exposed to dose above WHO guideline. Thus, biological indicators and thresholds for water treatment are extremely needed. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB For the first time the impedance-based xCELLigence real-time cell analysis system was used to measure the myotoxicity of sea snake venom. With a focus on the spine-bellied sea snake (Hydrophis curtus), the venom of four sea snake species and three terrestrial snake species were compared for myotoxicity against a human skeletal muscle cell line (HSkMC). Hydrophis curtus venom was also tested on a human cardiac muscle cell line (HCM). Surprisingly, all four sea snake venoms tested on HSkMC produced an initial 100-280% rise in xCELLigence cell index that peaked within the first two hours before falling. The cell index rise of H. curtus venom was correlated with the WST-1 cell proliferation assay, which demonstrated an increase in mitochondrial metabolism. The myotoxicity of H. curtus was 4.7-8.2 fold less potent than the other sea snakes tested, the Australian beaked sea snake (Hydrophis zweifeli), the elegant sea snake (Hydrophis elegans) and the olive sea snake (Aipysurus laevis). If our cell-based results translate to H. curtus envenomations, this implies that H. curtus would be less myotoxic than the other three. Yet the myotoxicity of H. curtus venom to cardiac muscle cells was nine times weaker than for skeletal muscle cells, providing evidence that the venom has a selective effect on skeletal muscle cells. This evidence, combined with the slow-acting nature of the venom, supports a digestive role for sea snake myotoxins. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background: Acute exacerbation of COPD ( AECOPD) is one of the leading causes for hospitalization and readmission in developed countries. No laboratory indices were consistently found to be associated with readmission risk. Recent evidence attests that red blood cell distribution width ( RDW), conveys important information for short and long term prognosis in a variety of medical conditions. Prognostic usefulness of RDW in patients with AECOPD has not been investigated.
   Objective: To evaluate the usefulness of RDW in predicting early adverse outcomes in patients hospitalized due to AECOPD.
   Methods: Patients hospitalized for AECOPD between 2011 and 2013 were revised. Clinical and laboratory parameters were noted. Participants were followed to determine the incidence of readmission due to AECOPD, readmission from any cause and composite end point of readmission or death during 60 days after discharge.
   Results: 539 patients were included in the study. The 60-day overall readmission rate was 26.35%, of that, 41.55% were due to AECOPD. The Presence of heart failure, pH below 7.35 at discharge and abnormal RDW were associated with the composite endpoint. The negative predictive value of normal RDW was 80.12%.
   Conclusion: Increased RDW is an independent negative prognostic factor associated with adverse outcomes after hospitalization due to AECOPD.

AB Background: Asthma is often associated with other diseases. To identify and manage comorbidities is important, as these conditions may increase the disease burden.
   Objective: To describe the prevalence of comorbidities, disease burden and mortality across age groups in a large Swedish primary care real-life asthma population.
   Methods: Observational cohort study of asthma patients, all ages, identified from electronic medical records by ICD-10-CM code, data from 36 primary care centers. Data were linked to national mandatory Swedish health registers. Comorbidities were identified by ICD-10-CM codes and collected from electronic medical records and the National Patient Registers, mortality data from the Cause of Death Register. Exacerbations were defined as hospitalizations due to asthma, and/or emergency visits at hospital and/or prescription claims of oral steroids.
   Results: In total 33,468 patients ( 58% women) were included. The most prevalent comorbidities were acute upper respiratory tract infection ( 53%), rhinitis ( 25%), acute lower respiratory tract infection ( 25%), hypertension ( 21%), anxiety and depression ( 20%). The comorbidities associated with highest risk for an exacerbation were COPD OR 1.98 ( 95% CI: 1.80-2.19), nasal polyps OR 1.75 ( 95% CI: 1.49-2.05) and rhinitis OR 1.52 ( 95% CI: 1.41-1.63). All-cause mortality was similar to the Swedish population, 1011 deaths per 100,000 person/year compared with 1058 deaths ( standardized risk=0.99 [ 95% CI: 0.95-1.04]). The pulmonary related death rate was greater in the study population versus the Swedish population ( 122 versus 72 per 100,000person/year).
   Conclusion: Comorbid disease was frequent in this large real-life asthma population with an impact on exacerbations. To identify and treat comorbidities with impact on asthma outcomes are essential to improve

   CAPACITY; SKELETAL-MUSCLE
AB Background: Cardiovascular diseases play a major role in morbidity and mortality in the earlier stages of COPD. We hypothesized that systemic vascular dysfunction would be present even in patients who are currently considered at "low-risk" for negative cardiovascular outcomes, i.e., those with largely preserved FEV1, few exacerbations and only mild burden of respiratory symptoms ( GOLD spirometric grade 1, clinical group A).
   Methods: 16 patients ( FEV1=86 +/- 13%) and 16 age- and gender-matched controls underwent measurements of: a) central arterial stiffness by pulse wave velocity, b) brachial flow-mediated dilation and c) forearm muscle oxygenation by near-infrared spectroscopy. Computed tomography quantified emphysema (% of low attenuation areas ( LAA)) and airway disease.
   Results: Patients and controls were well matched for key clinical variables including co-morbidities burden. Thirteen patients presented with more than 5% LAA: emphysema extension was negatively related to transfer factor for carbon monoxide ( TLCO) ( r=-0.63; p=.01). Compared to controls, patients had higher central arterial stiffness, lower normalized ( to shear stress) flow-mediated dilation, delayed time to peak flow-mediated dilation and poorer muscle oxygenation ( p<.05). TLCO and emphysema, but not airway disease, were significantly related to each of these functional abnormalities ( r values ranging from 0.51 to 0.66; p<.05).
   Conclusion: Systemic vascular dysfunction is present in the earlier stages of COPD, particularly in patients with greater emphysema burden and low TLCO. Regardless FEV1, patients showing those structural and functional abnormalities might be at higher risk of negative events thereby deserving closer follow-up for early detection of cardiovascular disease.

AB Objective: To provide an evidence-based review of published data regarding normal range reference values and prediction equations for measurements of respiratory impedance using forced oscillation technique ( FOT) and impulse oscillometry ( IOs) in adults.
   Methods: A non-language-restricted search was performed using forced oscillation technique and impulse oscillometry as primary terms. Original research studies reporting respiratory system impedance reference values or prediction equations based on cohorts of >= 100 healthy adults were included. Publications cited in identified studies were also considered for inclusion.
   Results: Of 882 publications identified, 34 studies were included: 14 studies of FOT, 19 studies of IOs, and one study of both techniques. Nineteen studies provided prediction equations. Most reports were from Europe ( n=20) and Asia ( n=12) and included relatively small cohorts ( median=264 subjects). Across publications, there was marked variability in performance and technique of impedance measurements. Height and sex emerged as major contributors to available prediction equations. The contribution of weight was more pronounced at the obese end of the weight spectrum. The contribution of age was less clear, and elderly were largely under-represented. Ethnicity likely plays a role, but was under-reported in currently available literature. Inclusion of current and former smokers in some studies further confound the results.
   Conclusions: Currently available literature providing reference values and prediction equations for respiratory impedance measurements in adults is limited. Until larger-scale standardized studies are available, the choice of prediction equations should be based on datasets that best represent the target patient population and modality in use within each pulmonary physiology laboratory.

AB Background: Asthma is characterized by airway inflammation and bronchial hyperreactivity. It is conceived that aging may affect asthma characteristics, but this issue is still not completely clarified in clinical practice.
   Objective: The present study investigated whether aging may affect some clinical and functional factors in outpatients with asthma visited in a real-world setting, such as clinical practice.
   Methods: Globally, 391 outpatients ( 163 males, median age 47 years) with asthma were consecutively evaluated. The following parameters were assessed: history, including, smoking, comorbidity, and inhaled corticosteroids ( ICS) use, physical examination, body mass index ( BMI), lung function, level of asthma control, asthma control test ( ACT), and fractional exhaled NO ( FeNO).
   Results: The elderly with asthma had: more frequently not controlled asthma, higher BMI, higher ICS dosages, more impaired lung function, including plethysmographic parameters, than adult asthmatics ( p < 0.001 for all, but p= 0.002 for RV and p= 0.008 for FRC). Elderly asthmatics were also less frequently allergic ( p < 0.001) and had less rhinitis comorbidity ( p < 0.001) and less nasal symptoms ( p < 0.05) than younger asthmatics.
   Conclusions: The present study conducted in a real-world setting shows that aging significantly affects asthma, mainly concerning asthma control, lung function, and steroid-sensitivity.

AB Few studies have investigated the association between serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D ( 25[ OH] D), vitamin D supplement and asthma control among adults. We aimed to examine whether low levels of serum 25( OH) D or not taking vitamin D supplement were associated with an increased risk of poorly controlled asthma among Norwegian adults with asthma.
   We used a definition of asthma control adapted from the Global Initiative for Asthma. We first examined cross-sectional associations between serum 25( OH) D ( n=806) or vitamin D supplement ( n=1179) and poorly controlled asthma. Next, among those with well controlled asthma at baseline, we examined prospective associations between serum 25( OH) D ( n=147) or vitamin D supplement ( n=208) and poorly controlled asthma at follow-up, approximately 11 years later. We estimated risk ratios ( RR) and 95% confidence intervals ( CI) with Poisson regression.
   The adjusted RR for poorly controlled asthma was 1.00 ( 95% CI, 0.89-1.13) for adults with serum 25( OH) D < 50 nmol/L in cross-sectional and 1.50 ( 95% CI, 0.46-4.95) in prospective analyses. The adjusted RR for poorly controlled asthma was 1.17 ( 95% CI 1.00-1.37) for non-users of vitamin D supplement in cross-sectional and 1.66 ( 95% CI 0.49-5.67) in prospective analyses.
   Our study did not show strong evidence that among adults with asthma, having a low serum 25( OH) D or being a non-user of vitamin D supplement was associated with an increased risk of poorly controlled asthma. Some point estimates indicated an increased risk, however our estimates were generally imprecise and further evidence is needed.

AB Exposure to laboratory animals ( LA) can cause allergic sensitization and symptoms as rhinitis, conjunctivitis, asthma, anaphylaxis and dermatitis. In 2000, a program was instituted at Trieste Universities to decrease LA allergy among scientists and technicians working with animals. The aim of our study was to investigate LA allergy in workers exposed to LA from 2001 to 2016, and to verify the effects of a preventive program.
   Four hundred sixty seven people underwent pre-employment screening for a job with laboratory animals at Universities of Trieste consisting in a medical examination, a full respiratory and allergy anamnesis, using a standardized questionnaire, skin prick test with common and occupational allergens, and spirometry. Every year, each worker repeated the medical examination and underwent again tests and questionnaire. Each worker can ask for a medical examination and skin prick test, in case of unset of symptoms. Logistic multivariate analysis and generalized equation estimation were use, to verify factors associated to LA allergy.
   Sensitization to LA decreased in years, going from 25.6% in 2001-2004 to 8.2% in 2013-2016 ( p < 0.001). Multivariate logistic regression analysis confirmed the role of atopy by prick test ( OR= 6; IC95% 2.2-16.6), of common allergic symptoms ( OR= 2.9; IC95% 1.4-6.39) and of calendar periods. No association was found between LA allergy, years, and hours of exposure. Our study demonstrated a significant reduction of LA allergy after the application of a preventive program.

AB Objective: The aim of this study was to investigate whether smokers with incidental findings of interstitial lung abnormalities have an increased mortality during long-term follow-up, and review the contributing causes of death.
   Methods: Baseline CT scans of 1990 participants from the Danish Lung Cancer Screening Trial were qualitatively assessed for predefined interstitial lung abnormalities of any severity. Inclusion criteria for this lung cancer screening trial included current or former smoking, > 20 pack-years, and age 50-70 years. Patients were followed up for up to 12 years.
   Results: We found interstitial lung abnormalities in 332 participants ( 16.7%). Interstitial lung abnormalities were associated with increased all-cause mortality in the full cohort ( HR: 2.0, 95% CI: 1.4-2.7, P < 0.001) and in lung cancer-free participants ( HR: 1.6, 95% CI: 1.1-2.4, P=0.007). The findings were associated with death from lung cancer ( HR: 3.2, 95% CI: 1.7-6.2, P < 0.001) and non-pulmonary malignancies ( HR: 2.1, 95% CI: 1.1-4.0, P=0.02). Participants with fibrotic and non-fibrotic interstitial lung abnormalities had similar survival.
   Conclusion: Interstitial lung abnormalities were common in this lung cancer screening population of relatively healthy smokers and were associated with mortality regardless of the interstitial morphological phenotype. The increased mortality was partly due to an association with lung cancer and non-pulmonary malignancies.

AB Background: Pulmonary function in former preterm infants may be compromised during childhood.
   Objectives: To assess pulmonary function in very-low-birth-weight preterm infants at 6-12 months of corrected age and analyze the factors associated with abnormal pulmonary function.
   Methods: Cross-sectional study with preterm infants at 6-12 months of corrected age with birth weight < 1500 g. Children with malformations or affected by neuromuscular and respiratory diseases were excluded. Forced expiratory flows were assessed using the chest compression technique, and volumes were measured by total body plethysmography. Pulmonary function parameters in preterm infants were compared to a control group of same-aged children born at term.
   Results: We studied 51 preterm and 37 infants born at term. Preterm infants had: gestational age at birth ( 30.0 +/- 2.5 weeks), birth weight ( 1179 +/- 247 g), 27.5% had bronchopulmonary dysplasia, and 45% received mechanical ventilation. Preterm infants had lower median z-scores in comparison to term infants for the following parameters ( p < 0.05): FVC (-0.3 vs. 0.7), FEV0.5 (-0.5 vs. 0.9), FEV0.5/FVC (-0.6 vs. -0.5), FEF50 (-0.4 vs. 0.9), FEF75 (-0.3 vs. 0.8), FEF85 (-0.1 vs. 0.6) and FEF25-75 (-0.5 vs. 1.1). No term child had abnormal lung function, compared to 39.2% of preterm infants ( p=0.001). Factors associated with abnormal pulmonary function were lower gestational age at birth, small for gestational age, need for mechanical ventilation and presence of recurrent wheezing.
   Conclusions: Preterms had a high prevalence of abnormal pulmonary function and lower pulmonary function in comparison to term infants. Prematurity, intrauterine growth restriction, respiratory support and recurrent wheezing were associated with abnormal pulmonary function.

AB Background: The impact of viral infections on acute exacerbations in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis ( IPF) and/or non-IPF interstitial lung disease ( ILDs) has been scarcely described.
   Objectives: To elucidate the frequency of virus infections in patients with IPF or non-IPF ILDs including idiopathic interstitial pneumonia ( IIP) or connective tissue disease ( CTD)-associated pneumonia, and its influence on their short-term mortality.
   Methods: We prospectively enrolled adult patients with acute exacerbation of IPF and non-IPF ILDs who were admitted to the hospital during the last 3 years, and examined the respiratory samples obtained from nasopharyngeal, sputum, and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid.
   Results: A total of 78 patients were identified, consisting of 27 patients with acute exacerbation of IPF and 51 patients with non-IPF ILDs ( IIP: n=27, CTD-associated IP: n=24). Of all patients, 15 ( 19.2%) had viruses detected in their respiratory samples including the human herpesvirus 7 ( HHV7; n=4) and cytomegalovirus ( CMV) plus HHV7 ( n=3). The proportion of virus infections in the IPF and non-IPF ILDs groups was comparable. The Kaplan-Meier survival curves over 60 days revealed a lower survival probability in the virus positive group ( n=15, 60%) than in the virus negative group ( n=60, 83.3%, p < 0.05). However, the virus infection itself could not predict the 60-day survival probability using simple logistic regression analysis.
   Conclusions: Viral infections, mostly CMV or HHV7, were identified in both patients with acute exacerbation of IPF and non-IPF ILDs, but the clinical significance on short-term mortality or isolation itself from respiratory samples remains to be determined.

AB Background: Recent evidence indicates that autoimmunity may contribute to the pathogenesis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD). COPD was observed at higher frequency in patients with several autoimmune diseases. The association between pemphigus and COPD has not been evaluated in the past.
   Objectives: To study the association between pemphigus and COPD using a large-scale real-life computerized database.
   Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted comparing pemphigus patients with age-, sex- and ethnicity-matched control subjects regarding the prevalence of COPD and lung cancer. Chi-square and t-tests were used for bivariate analysis, and logistic regression model was used for multivariate analysis. The study was performed utilizing the computerized database of Clalit Health Services ensuring 4.4 million subjects.
   Results: A total of 1985 pemphigus patients and 9874 controls were included in the study. The prevalence of COPD was greater in patients with pemphigus as compared to the control group ( 13.4% vs. 10.1%, respectively; P < 0.001). In a multivariate analysis adjusting for smoking and other confounding factors, pemphigus was significantly associated with COPD ( OR, 1.312-1. 5) but not with lung cancer. Study findings were robust to sensitivity analysis that included patients under pemphigus-specific treatments.
   Conclusions: A significant association was found between COPD and pemphigus. Physicians treating patients with pemphigus might be aware of this possible association. This observation may further support the hypothesis that COPD has an autoimmune component.

AB Reformer gas (syngas) addition to main fuel is a practical solution for combustion timing control in HCCI engines. This study emphasizes the understanding of various effects of reformer gas (RG) addition, with composition of 75%vol H-2 and 25%vol CO, in HCCI combustion by developing an artificial inert species method and using a detailed chemical kinetics multi-zone model. Three fuels (iso-octane, n-heptane, and natural gas) with different autoignition characteristics were used in this study. The developed multi-zone model was validated for mentioned fuels at various percentages of RG using six experimental cases of a single-cylinder CFR engine. The results showed that increasing reformer gas fraction in the fuel mixture advanced methane fuel combustion timing, retarded the combustion of n-heptane and had insignificant effect on iso-octane combustion. Thermal effect of RG in all fuels resulted in earlier start of combustion (SOC) because of the mixture specific heat ratio enhancement. The SOC for methane and iso-octane fuels was advanced by RG addition due to the chemical effect of RG. However, the chemical effect of RG for methane fuel is more significant. By adding 30% RG to methane fuel, H-2 advanced the SOC by -5.6 degrees CA and CO retarded it by 1.4 degrees CA due to chemical effect and also the interaction effect of CO and H-2 advanced the SOC by -1.8 degrees CA. For iso-octane fuel, adding 30% RG, both CO and H-2 advanced the SOC by 0.4 CA due to their chemical effect. On the other hand, in n-heptane fuel, H-2 is almost responsible for all of the chemical effects of RG for retardation of SOC.

AB This work shows the capabilities of E85 fuel to be used as low reactivity fuel in a high compression ratio light-duty diesel engine (17.1:1) running under reactivity controlled compression ignition concept. To do this, experimental steady-state engine maps are obtained in a single-cylinder engine with diesel-E85 fuel combination. The engine mapping was performed following the same procedure used in previous works with other fuel combinations to allow the results comparison. Considering the mechanical and emissions limits imposed during the engine mapping, it was found that with diesel-E85 the combustion concept is limited to the region defined from 2 to 7 bar at 1000 rpm, and from 1.5 to 9 bar indicated mean effective pressure at 3000 rpm. This operating region was satisfied with nitrogen oxides, soot and pressure rise rate levels below 0.4 g/kWh, 0.01 g/kWh and 10 bar/CAD, respectively. The reactivity controlled compression ignition maps with diesel-E85 were obtained taking as reference the total fuel energy used in a previous work to map the engine with diesel-gasoline. The direct comparison of both combustion concepts (diesel-E85 and diesel-gasoline) revealed that E85 allows to extend the engine map around 2 bar indicated mean effective pressure towards the high load region. Moreover, the minimum load achieved at high engine speeds was decreased down to 1.5 indicated mean effective pressure. Finally, the differences in terms of emissions and performance between both reactivity controlled compression ignition concepts are highlighted by doing the difference between the maps of several variables.

AB The goal of this study was to model Germany's 3D wind resource using the wind speed-wind shear model (WSWS) on a high spatial resolution grid (200 m x 200 m). The model is based on near-surface wind speed data and reanalysis wind speed data. Furthermore, terrain and land use features were used to develop predictor variables for statistical mapping of study area-wide WSWS parameters. This enables the continuous assessment of the meteorological potential between 10 m and 200 m above ground level. The application of different wind turbine-specific power curves allowed the estimation of the technical potential in the range of common hub heights. Based on the estimates of the meteorological and technical potential, the area which is suitable for wind turbine installation (capacity factor > 0.20) was quantified. It was found that the installation of wind turbines is feasible between 6.6% (hub height of 74 m) and 78.9% (hub height of 169 m) of the study area, depending on wind turbine type. It is assumed that the high spatial resolution modeling improves the assessment of Germany's wind resource from local to the national scale. Since the 3D parameterization of WSWS is based on freely available data, the applied methodology is highly portable and can be transferred to other areas around the world.

AB Black silicon (nanostructured front surface) can significantly improve the efficiency of the silicon solar cell by absorbing more solar irradiance. However, due to the band gap of the semiconductor material, most part of the absorbed solar irradiance is converted into heat to increase the temperature of solar cell. Especially under the concentrating condition, the waste heat is more. Besides, multi-physics coupling problem makes it difficult to study the effects of nanostructures on the performances of the low concentrated black silicon photovoltaic system. In this study, a multi-physics model of a low concentration photovoltaics (LCPV) that employs an all back-contact black silicon solar cell is built. As for the multi-physics problem in LCPV, a multi-physics coupling mathematical model is developed. Its advantage is to couple near-flied optics, photoelectric conversion, and heat transfer. Furthermore, through parameter sensitivity analysis, it is proved that the coupling mathematical model is more accurate, because it takes full account of the nonlinear correlation between the output power and the temperature, and the effects of series resistance under concentrating condition. Hence, the mathematical model is used to investigate the coupling effects of nanostructures, and it is found that the nanostructure with lower reflectance may not be beneficial for the low concentrated black silicon photovoltaic due to the increased temperature. According to different circumstances, the maximum output power with the lower cost could be achieved by choosing the nanostructure with appropriate reflectance. At last, the dynamic analysis proves that the coupling effects of nanostructure lead to the result that the nanostructure with lower reflectance reduces the annual power generation per square meter of the low concentrated black silicon photovoltaic system by about 116 kW h/m(2) when the concentration ratio is 10.

AB A comparison of the gasification performance of olive pomace, coal, petcoke and their binary and ternary blends was carried out by means of TGA (thermogravimetric analysis) coupled with mass spectrometry (MS). The thermochemical behavior of the raw materials was a function of their composition and inorganic content. Olive pomace had a low ash content, a high volatile content and a low moisture. Moreover, olive pomace presented the highest reactivity. On the other hand, olive pomace presented the highest H-2, CO, CO2, CH4 and NO emissions, while the highest SO2 release was obtained with petcoke, showing the output stream coming from the gasification of coal the highest H-2/CO ratio. The presence of olive pomace in the blends improved their reactivity, increased the H-2 release and the H-2/CO ratio, and decreased the CO yield. A synergistic effect was observed in the gasification of the binary blend of olive pomace and petcoke. On the contrary, the gasification of the binary blend of olive pomace and coal presented an antagonistic effect. In ternary blends, either ssynergistic or antagonistic effects were observed, which depended on raw materials ratios in the feed. Finally, the lower the olive pomace ratio in the blends, the higher the porosity of the remaining residue was.

AB In this work, an improved counterflow double-channel micro combustor is designed. Computational Fluid Dynamics software Fluent is used to conduct numerical investigations on the thermal performance comparison between the old and improved counterflow double-channel micro combustors. It is found that the improved counterflow double-channel micro combustor has much higher and more uniform wall temperature compared that of the old one under various hydrogen mass flow rates, hydrogen/air equivalence ratios and solid materials. To make a quantitative comparison, the main results are presented as follows: (a) The improved combustor achieves the largest thermal enhancement at the hydrogen mass flow rate of 5.25 x 10(-7) kg/s when the hydrogen mass flow rate is ranged from 5.25 x 10(-7) kg/s to 9.8245 x 10(-7) kg/s. Namely, the mean temperature of upper and right wall is improved by about 9.66 K and 13.53 K, respectively, and the mean nonuniformity of upper and right wall temperature is reduced by about 23.24% and 26.79%, respectively. (b) The improved combustor achieves the largest thermal enhancement at the hydrogen/air equivalence ratio of 0.6, when the hydrogen/air equivalence ratio is ranged from 0.9 to 0.5. Namely, the mean temperature of upper and right wall is improved by about 27.55 K and 29.55 K, respectively, and the mean nonuniformity of upper and right wall temperature is reduced by about 23.24% and 19.51%, respectively. (c) The improved combustor achieves the largest thermal enhancement at the solid material of silicon carbide when the solid material is changed from quartz to silicon carbide. Namely, the mean temperature of upper and right wall is improved by about 16.77 K and 18.38 K, respectively, and the mean nonuniformity of upper and right wall temperature is reduced by about 26.47% and 28.41%, respectively. Finally, some guidelines are proposed for applications of the improved counterflow double-channel micro combustor in the micro-thermophotovoltaic system.

AB One of the promising methods to increase exergoeconomic performance and decrease effects of environmental adverse of energy systems is integration of energy systems. Gas turbine power plant is one of the favorable power generation systems because of its acceleration in start-up and low investment cost. However, the thermal efficiency of gas turbine cycle is low because of the significant heat loss due to high-temperature effluent gas exhausted from the stack. Therefore, if this huge heat loss is recovered by another heat engine coupled with gas turbine cycle the total efficiency will increase, considerably. Stirling engine owing to its high efficiency is one of the promising candidates which can be used as a part of the combined system. Hence, an optimization analysis on standalone gas turbine cycle, as well as combined cycle of gas turbine and Stirling engine are considered in this paper to find out the optimal operational point, thermodynamically and economically. Both single-objective and multi-objective genetic algorithm is performed to optimize the overall plant parameters, subjecting three optimization scenarios of maximizing exegetic efficiency, minimizing levelized cost of electricity and exergoeconomic optimization. A comprehensive comparison of gas turbine and Stirling engine combined cycle and standalone gas turbine cycle was performed for these optimization scenarios. Results show a significant improvement in power output and reduction of levelized cost of electricity in combined cycle of gas turbine and Stirling engine. In the optimal point of this hybrid system, levelized cost of electricity reduces by 10.3% and exergetic efficiency improves by 16.1% compared with the optimal point of standalone gas turbine cycle.

AB Adsorptive transformation of heat is an energy and environment saving technology, which allows effective utilization of low temperature heat sources. Recently, a new adsorption cycle (the so-called "Heat from Cold" or HeCol) has been suggested for amplification of the ambient heat in cold regions up to higher temperature, suitable for heating. In this paper, at first we analyzed which adsorbent is needed for practical realization of the HeCol cycle. Then, the composite sorbent, based on LiCl and silica gel, was selected for the comprehensive study, and its sorption equilibrium with methanol was analyzed keeping in mind the requirements of the HeCol cycle. Finally, a first lab-scale HeCol prototype was tested with the LiCl/silica sorbent to evaluate the feasibility of the new cycle. The effects of the heat source temperature and the rate of heat transfer fluid on the prototype performance were studied. It was shown that at heat source temperature of 20-30 degrees C, the maximum temperature of the released heat reaches 34-53 degrees C, which is suitable for warm floor and hot water systems. The maximum specific heating power varies from 6.0 to 10.8 kW/kg and the sorbent heating capacity reaches 620 kJ/kg. The results obtained clearly demonstrate that the use of the LiCl/silica sorbent allows quite compact HeCol units to be designed.

AB In this experimental investigation, four different types of biodiesel fuels were employed to investigate the effects of fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) proportion on emission and combustion characteristics of a marine diesel engine in terms of heat release rate, cylinder pressure, indicated power, brake specific fuel consumption (BSFC), CO emission, HC emission and NOx emissions. In accordance with international IS08178 standards, the experiments were carried out on a four cylinders direct injection diesel engine fueled with four different types of biodiesel fuels and pure diesel at two test cycle modes of E3 and D2. The experimental results showed that the kinematic viscosity and ignition delay time (IDT) of biodiesel fuel in combustion process played very important roles. The chemical IDT can be shorten by the higher saturation level and the kinematic viscosity will be increased due to the higher saturation contents like C18:0 and C16:0 together with C18:1 which is a single double bond methyl ester. The increased kinematic viscosity can result in poor evaporation process and poor fuel-air mixing. Lower kinematic viscosity methyl esters like C18:3 and C18:2 are beneficial for better combustion and fuel-air mixing, but the higher nitrogen oxide emission is discovered. Thus, the relationship between emission and combustion characteristics and proportion of biodiesel is not straightforward and simple, the balance of five majority components of biodiesel fuel is very significant. Compared with pure diesel, the oxygen content of biodiesel fuel improves the in-cylinder combustion. It is beneficial to decreasing HC and CO emissions and increasing NOx emissions. However, it is not obvious at low load.

AB This study is a comparative analysis of hydrogen production costs in current and potential future market environments. The economic feasibility of hydrogen production by thermal decomposition of methane was compared to two other technologies, namely steam methane reforming and water electrolysis. According to the results, thermal decomposition of methane would be most suited for on-site demand-driven hydrogen production in small or medium industrial scale. Hydrogen production by thermal decomposition of methane would be economically competitive with steam reforming with a product carbon value of at least 280-310 EUR/tonne. By contrast, the main benefit of thermal decomposition of methane in comparison with water electrolysis is the feedstock availability via the current natural gas infrastructure, whereas electrolysis is highly dependent on the cost and availability of renewable electricity. The major factors affecting the economic feasibility were identified as product carbon value in thermal decomposition of methane, natural gas cost in steam reforming, and electricity cost in electrolysis. Thus, the effect of these variables on the hydrogen production costs was analyzed. Additionally, the specific carbon dioxide emissions in hydrogen production by thermal decomposition of methane (40 kgCO(2)/MWhH(2)) were found to be much less that by steam reforming coupled with carbon dioxide capture from the syngas (133 kgCO(2)/MWhH(2)).

AB Energy recovery from Natural Gas (NG) distribution networks is a promising strategy in order to pursue energy sustainability in urban areas. The NG pressure reduction process, normally achieved by means of conventional throttling valves, can be upgraded by implementing turbo expander technology, which allows recovery of energy from the NG pressure drop. As commonly known, in this process the NG must be preheated in order to avoid methane-hydrate formation. The preheating temperature represents a key parameter of the process, on which depends the possibility of integrating low enthalpy heat sources into the system and of exploiting more efficient technologies and renewable energies as well. In this work, the possibility of integrating a pressure reduction station with low temperature heat sources is studied. In particular, a novel plant configuration consisting of a two-stage expansion system is presented and its energy performances are investigated by means of numerical dynamic simulations. The risk of formation of methane hydrate is assessed for different operating conditions and for transient behavior. Finally, the energy efficiency of PRSs with high and low temperature configuration is compared, showing how the two stage expansion can achieve higher energy performance and be effectively integrated with low enthalpy heat sources.

AB Aiming at the problem that the irreversible loss of the condensation process for the traditional LNG power generation system is too large, this paper presents four different two-stage condensation Rankine cycles based on different arrangements of pumps and turbines. The effects of the operating conditions (the first-stage and second stage condensation temperatures) and various working fluids on the performance of the four cycles with different structures are investigated. The results show that when the arrangement of the turbines is the same, the arrangement of the pumps (series or parallel) has little effect on the net output power. However, when the arrangement for the pumps is the same, the arrangement for the turbines has a significant effect on the net output power. When the working fluid is n-pentane and the turbines are of series arrangement, the maximum net output power is increased by about 17% compared with the condition that the turbines are of parallel arrangement. In addition, for the same cycle, whether the isentropic efficiency of turbine is a constant value or not has a significant effect on the maximum net output power, the optimal operating conditions, and the optimal working fluid.

AB This paper proposes a novel military philosophy inspired meta-heuristic algorithm called democratic joint operations algorithm (DJOA), which attempts to find the optimal parameters of proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controllers of permanent magnetic synchronous generator (PMSG) based wind energy conversion system (WECS), such that a maximum power point tracking (MPPT) under different wind speed profiles can be achieved. In order to realize a deeper optimum search, an additional deputy officer is introduced into the democratic defensive operations of each military unit, in which the soldiers can wisely seek a more optimal defensive position following the consensus/compromise of the officer and deputy officer. Furthermore, the shuffling strategy of shuffled frog leaping algorithm (SFLA) is employed for the shuffling regroup operations of DJOA, which effectively avoids the local optimum trapping by sharing the global position information among all the soldiers. Three case studies are carried out, e.g., step change of wind speed, low-turbulence stochastic wind speed variation, and high-turbulence stochastic wind speed variation, respectively. Simulation results verify that an improved optimal power extraction can be realized by DJOA compared with that of other five typical meta heuristic algorithms.

AB In this present work, green and efficient utilization concepts in the form of the use of an external magnetic field have been applied to improve catalytic performance in CO2 hydrogenation. The 10Fe-10Cu catalysts with two types of supports, core-shell and infiltrate mesoporous silica-aluminosilicate materials, were applied under external magnetic fields of different intensities (0, 20.8 mT, 27.7 mT) and orientations (north-to-south (N-S), south-to-north (S-N) directions). It was found that a magnetic field considerably enhanced both CO2 conversion and methanol and DME selectivities. The highest CO2 conversion was obtained over 10Fe-10Cu/infiltrate catalyst under the magnetic field conditions of 27.7 mT and 4N-S direction at 260 degrees C (conversion was 1.5 times greater than that without a magnetic field). Under such conditions and at 240 degrees C, the highest methanol and DME space time yields were obtained, with results 1.8-1.9 times higher than those of without a magnetic field. These excellent performances could be ascribed to the superior adsorption of CO2 and H-2 reactant gas molecules over the surface of magnetized catalysts under external magnetic field. This leads to the advantages of the catalyzed CO2 hydrogenation-decreases in the operating temperature and simultaneous reduction in CO2 emission to the atmosphere. This therefore facilitates a carbon-neutral route of CO2 utilization.

AB In this study, a non-dimensional model of a tri-generation unit consisting parabolic trough solar collector, integrated with solar cell and thermoelectric generator is presented. In order to obtain the effects of solar irradiance and ambient temperature on the performance of the system, a set of functions were coded in the MATLAB software. Eight nonlinear algebraic equations were derived and solved via the iterative Newton-Raphson technique. The thermal and electrical efficiencies, the electrical characteristics of the thermoelectric and photovoltaic modules, and the thermal and electrical power of the hybrid device were analyzed in this study. The results have reflected some improvements on the electrical efficiency by placing thermoelectric module and solar cell on the lateral area of the absorber tube. Furthermore, an electrical power of 22.714 W could be reached at the solar concentration of 998 W/m(2). In order to validate the results of the mathematical model, two research works have been utilized. The evaluation of the obtained results shows a good agreement with the results in the literature.

AB Objective: Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is an independent risk factor for stroke. Little is known about the cerebrovascular hemodynamic changes during apnea. Hypercapnia occurs in apneas and hypopneas, and a reduced cerebral vasodilatory response to CO2 could compromise the cerebral blood flow (CBF). Therefore, we aimed to evaluate whether the apneaehypopnea index (AHI) affected the cerebrovascular response to CO2.
   Methods: A total of 11 patients with OSA were compared to 16 controls. We assessed the cerebrovascular responses with arterial spin labeling (ASL) and blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) magnetic resonance imaging during hypercapnia or breath-holding tasks.
   Results: The CBF response to CO2 was impaired with increasing AHI (average CBF: p = 0.018; gray matter: p = 0.038; white matter: p = 0.045), that is, increased OSA severity. When comparing the OSA patients to the control subjects, the OSA patients had a significantly reduced CO2 response of the white matter CBF (p = 0.04). However, the BOLD response to CO2 and the breath-holding task did not show any significant differences between OSA patients and control subjects.
   Conclusion: The cerebrovascular CO2 reactivity, measured by the CBF, was impaired with increasing AHI, that is, OSA severity. These findings may add to the understanding of the increased stroke risk found in OSA patients. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Study objective: To assess comorbidities in a community-based cohort of narcolepsy.
   Methods: A 2000-2014 community-based narcolepsy cohort was identified in Olmsted County, Minnesota. Records were reviewed by a certified sleep specialist for accuracy of diagnosis, and comorbidities were extracted and analyzed. Comorbidities in narcolepsy subjects, both at diagnosis and upon follow-up, were compared with those in unaffected and age-and sex-matched cohort using conditional logistic regression.
   Results: At diagnosis, there was increased association of narcolepsy with anxiety (OR 4.56, 95% CI 1.99-10.44), thyroid disease (3.07, 1.19-7.90), hypertension (2.69, 1.22-5.93), and hyperlipidemia (2.49, 1.05-5.92). At the end of the prolonged observation period of 9.9 years (SD 7.27 years), there was increased association of narcolepsy with peripheral neuropathy (11.21, 1.16-108.11), non-migrainous headache (6.00, 1.73-20.83), glucose intolerance (2.39, 1.05-5.45), and automobile-related trauma (2.43, 1.08-5.45). Persistently increased both at diagnosis and after a prolonged observation period were associations of narcolepsy with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) (69.25, 9.26-517.99 decreasing to 13.55, 5.08-36.14), chronic low back pain (5.46, 2.46-12.11 to 2.58, 1.39-4.77), depression (4.88, 2.45-9.73 to 3.79, 2.12-6.79), psychiatric disorders in general (4.73, 2.49-9.01 to 3.40, 1.94-5.98), endocrinopathies (4.15, 1.81-9.56 to 2.45, 1.33-4.49), and obesity (2.27, 1.13-4.56 to 2.07, 1.15-3.7).
   Conclusions: In this community-based study of narcolepsy comorbidities, both at diagnosis and after prolonged follow-up, persistent comorbidities were revealed, including OSA, chronic low back pain, psychiatric disorders in general, endocrinopathies, and obesity. The comprehensive management of narcolepsy requires monitoring for and managing these important associated health conditions. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Background: This study aimed to evaluate all-cause mortality in relation to the use of benzodiazepines, antidepressants and antipsychotics in obstructive sleep apnoea ( OSA) patients and matched controls.
   Methods: Patients with a diagnosis of OSA and no pre-index use of psychotropic medication ( n = 38,735) were compared with control subjects ( n = 75,941) matched by age, gender, marital status and community location. National register data were used to obtain information on diagnoses ( the Danish National Patient Registry), mortality ( the Central Person Register) and psychotropic medication use ( the Danish Register on Medicinal Product Statistics).
   Results: All-cause mortality was higher in patients with OSA than in control subjects. Mortality hazard ratios were higher for OSA patients and controls who were prescribed serotonergic antidepressant drugs ( HR = 1.808, SD = 0.015, p = 0.001 in OSA patients; HR = 2.607, SD = 0.158, p < 0.001 in controls), tricyclic antidepressants ( HR = 1.846, SD = 0.166, p < 0.001; HR = 2.087, SD = 0.172, p < 0.001), benzodiazepines ( HR = 2.590, SD = 0.040, p < 0.001); ( HR = 3.705, SD = 0.085, p < 0.001), benzodiazepine-like drugs ( HR = 1.980, SD = 0.087, p < 0.001; HR = 2.227, SD = 0.083, p < 0.001), first-generation antipsychotics ( HR = 2.894, SD = 0.268, p < 0.001; HR = 1.210, SD = 0.509, NS), and second-generation antipsychotics ( HR = 2.069, SD = 0.182, p < 0.001; HR = 1.355, SD = 0.171, NS), compared with those who did not receive the drugs. Interaction analysis suggested that similar or slightly lower mortality was associated with selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors, benzodiazepines and second-generation antipsychotics in OSA compared with controls when comorbidities were taken into consideration.
   Conclusion: All-cause mortality was higher in OSA patients and especially controls treated with benzodiazepines, antidepressants or antipsychotics than in untreated controls. The findings were not controlled for psychiatric comorbidity and the results may have partly been attributable to confounding by indication. The results raised the possibility that the use of psychotropic medication may have deleterious health consequences, but the risk did not seem to be higher in OSA than in controls.

AB Objective: The presence of repeated nightmares in posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) has been hypothesized as a dysfunction of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, but there has been remarkably little agreement about the pathophysiology. This presents a deterrent to more effective treatments. REM sleep abnormalities including elevated REM density also have been replicated in major depressive disorder (MDD). The purpose of this study was to clarify the difference of REM sleep abnormalities between the two disorders for understanding the pathophysiology of sleep disturbances in PTSD.
   Methods: Polysomnographic measures were compared among 14 PTSD patients (aged 23.7 +/- 5.5 years) and 14 MDD patients (aged 27.9 +/- 10.1 years) under drug-naive or drug-free conditions. We defined REM interruption by summing the intrusive wake times during the REM period and adding the subsequent wake times to the last epoch of REM period. The significant polysomnographic measures were correlated with PTSD symptoms within the PTSD group.
   Results: REM interruption was significantly increased in the PTSD group compared with the MDD group (12.2 vs 2.1 min, p = 0.001). REM density was also significantly increased in the PTSD group compared with the MDD group (30.5 vs 23.1%, p = 0.019). Within the PTSD group, we found significant correlations between the severity of trauma-related nightmare complaints and the percentage of REM interruption (R = 0.62, p = 0.017), but not REM density.
   Conclusions: REM sleep abnormalities are different between PTSD and MDD. Increased REM interruption may be a biological marker correlated with nightmare complaints in PTSD patients. Treatments including pharmacotherapy that reduces REM interruption might ameliorate nightmares in PTSD. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Objective: Restless legs syndrome (RLS) and Parkinson's disease (PD) are common neurological disorders that respond to dopaminergic therapy. RLS prevalence among people with PD varies widely (0-38%) in the literature, complicating efforts to understand whether the two diseases might be associated.
   Method: The databases Web of Science, PubMed, Embase, Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure, Wanfang, and SinoMed were searched for observational and case-control studies of RLS prevalence in PD. Eligible studies were meta-analyzed using Stata 12.0.
   Results: Pooled RLS prevalence in PD among various patient populations was 14%, and prevalence in Asia (12%) was slightly lower than outside Asia (16%). Prevalence was higher among patients who had previously received PD treatment (15%) than among drug-naive patients (11%). Prevalence of RLS was higher in female PD patients (13%) than in male patients (11%). RLS prevalence was much higher among PD patients than among healthy controls (OR 2.86, 95% CI 2.10-3.90; p < 0.001).
   Conclusion: This meta-analysis may provide the first reliable pooled estimate of RLS prevalence in PD, and strong evidence that RLS risk is higher among PD patients than among healthy individuals. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Objectives: The prevalence of RLS in pregnancy is higher when compared with the general population however it remains unknown among indigenous black Africans. Available data indicate that RLS is uncommon in sub-Saharan Africa. We embarked on this study to determine the prevalence and characteristics of RLS in an antenatal clinic sample of Nigerian pregnant women compared with a primary care sample of non-pregnant women.
   Methods: A total of 310 pregnant women and non-pregnant women filled out a questionnaire which incorporated the 2014 minimal criteria of the International Restless Legs Syndrome Study Group. Demographic and clinical data, including sleep duration and samples for blood hemoglobin concentration and urinalysis were obtained.
   Results: The mean ages of the pregnant and non-pregnant women were 24.9 +/- 5.6 years and 23.6 thorn 5.4 years, respectively (p = 0.003). There was no case of RLS found among pregnant women while five (1.6%) of the non-pregnant women fulfilled the criteria for RLS. Overall, the prevalence report of RLS symptoms was associated with lower mean habitual nocturnal sleep duration (p < 0.05) coffee (p = 0.013) and kola nut (0.023) consumption, report of leg cramps (p < 0.001) and proteinuria (p = 0.047), Report of leg cramps and proteinuria were independently associated with RLS.

TI Sex differences in sleep-disordered breathing after stroke: results from
   the BASIC project
SO SLEEP MEDICINE

DT Article
DE Stroke; Gender; Obstructive sleep apnea
ID APNEA; RISK; PREVALENCE; THERAPY; DURATION
AB Objective/Background: Sleep-disordered breathing (SDB), an independent risk factor for stroke, is associated with worse post-stroke outcomes. Differences in the relationship between SDB and stroke may exist for women versus men. In this population-based study, we compared the prevalence of both pre- and post-stroke SDB by sex. We also explored whether menopausal status is related to post-stroke SDB.
   Patients/Methods: We performed a cross-sectional study of subjects enrolled in the Brain Attack Surveillance in Corpus Christi (BASIC) project. Each subject (n = 1815) underwent a baseline interview including the Berlin Questionnaire to assess pre-stroke SDB risk and, if relevant, questions regarding menopausal status. Subjects were offered overnight SDB screening with a validated portable respiratory device (n = 832 with complete data). Log Poisson and linear regression models were used to assess the differences in SDB between men and women with adjustment for demographics, stroke risk factors, stroke severity, and other potential confounders.
   Results: Women were less likely than men to be at high risk for pre-stroke SDB (56.6% versus 61.9%) (prevalence ratio [PR] 0.87 for women; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.81-0.95). A lower proportion of women than men (50.8% versus 70.2%) had post-stroke SDB by respiratory monitoring (PR 0.71; 95% CI, 0.63-0.80). SDB severity was higher for men than for women (mean difference in respiratory event index [REI] 6.5; 95% CI, 4.3-8.7). No significant association existed between post-stroke SDB and either menopausal status or age at menopause.
   Conclusions: After acute ischemic stroke, SDB was more prevalent and more severe in men than in women. (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Pre-Sleep Arousal Scale (PSAS): psychometric study of a European
   Portuguese version
SO SLEEP MEDICINE

DT Article

ID PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGICAL INSOMNIA; HYPERAROUSAL; NUMBER
AB Objective/Background: Pre-sleep arousal constitutes one of the major features of insomnia. As such, it is imperative to have adequate instruments to measure this construct in both clinical and research settings. The Pre-Sleep Arousal Scale (PSAS) is the most well-known measure to evaluate pre-sleep arousal. The current study aimed to examine some of the psychometric properties of a European Portuguese version of the scale.
   Participants/Methods: For this purpose, data from 691 undergraduate students from a medical school were analyzed. Internal consistency indices and factor analysis were performed. In addition, the association between the PSAS and its subscales with other measures was also examined. Finally, PSAS scores of self-reported insomniacs were compared with those of self-reported non-insomniacs.
   Results: The results indicated that the PSAS comprises a cognitive scale and a somatic scale, both with adequate internal consistency indices (alpha = 0.82 and 0.79, respectively). However, a three-factor solution also seemed plausible, suggesting that the original somatic arousal subscale might be divided into two subscales. Significant associations between the PSAS total score and its subscales were found with other concurrent measures such as sleep reactivity to stress, arousability and neuroticism. Self-defined insomniacs presented higher levels of cognitive and somatic arousal than healthy individuals.
   Conclusions: Further investigations of the PSAS are needed to refine its psychometric properties and explore its research and clinical utility in other populations. (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is characterized by apneas and hypopneas that result in hypoxia, cerebral hypoperfusion, endothelial dysfunction, inflammation, and oxidative stress. These pathophysiologic processes likely contribute to neuronal damage. Tau is a protein that stabilizes microtubules and, along with amyloid beta (A beta), is associated with neurodegenerative processes. We sought to determine if tau and other biomarkers of inflammation were related to OSA severity.
   Concentrations of tau, A beta 40, A beta 42, c-reactive protein (CRP), TNF-alpha, interleukin (IL)-6, and IL-10 were measured in blood and compared between participants with moderate-severe OSA (n = 28), those with mild OSA (n = 22), and healthy controls (n = 24). The cohort included relatively young, primarily male active duty military personnel without a history of traumatic brain injury or neurodegenerative disease. Total biomarker concentrations were determined from plasma samples using an ultra-sensitive detection method, Simoa (TM), and CRP was assayed by ELISA. Total tau and IL-6 concentrations were elevated in participants with moderate-severe OSA, with a mean apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) of 26.1/h, compared to those with mild OSA (mean AHI 8.6/h) and healthy controls (mean AHI 2.1/h). Tau concentrations were also significantly correlated with the AHI (r = 0.342, p = 0.004). Our findings show that tau is elevated in the blood of young patients with moderate-severe OSA, suggesting that this degree of sleep-disordered breathing is a contributing factor in the development of neurodegenerative disorders. The finding of increased IL-6 further suggests that inflammatory biomarkers are present early in the course of this chronic disease. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Objective: Previous research has demonstrated a link between childhood anxiety and sleep problems, but little is known about the link between these difficulties and parental sleep disturbances. The purpose of the current study was to explore the association between anxious children's sleep difficulties and those of their mothers.
   Method: A total of 101 children aged 8-18 years and their mothers participated in this study. The clinical group included 66 children (mean age = 11.45 years, standard deviation = 2.79 years) diagnosed with anxiety disorders, and the control group included 35 age- and sex-matched normal healthy controls. Mothers completed questionnaires assessing their child's anxiety and sleep, as well as their own sleep. Children completed questionnaires assessing anxiety, sleep, depression, and obsessive symptoms.
   Results: Both children and mothers in the clinical group exhibited more sleep difficulties compared to controls. A regression analysis revealed that pre-sleep arousal negatively predicted children's sleep. Furthermore, children's anxiety level was associated with parental levels of sleep disturbances. This link was fully mediated by the children's sleep disturbances score.
   Conclusion: Mothers of children with anxiety disorders exhibit higher levels of sleep disturbances than controls. These difficulties are linked to children's anxiety and sleep problems. When treating children with anxiety, it is therefore important to assess their overall sleep disturbances, as well as parental sleep difficulties, and when appropriate to add a specific sleep intervention component.

AB Objective: To assess the relationship between excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS), disability, mortality, and life expectancy (with and without disability) in a cohort of middle-aged American adults.
   Methods: The Wisconsin Longitudinal Study, a life-course study on 10,317 high school graduates from Wisconsin, was used to assess the odds ratio (OR) between EDS in 2004 for prevalent and incident disability to 2011 through multiple logistic regression, and to estimate the hazard ratio (HR) of EDS in 2004 for mortality over ten years through a Cox proportional hazard model. We estimated age and sex-specific rates for mortality and disability from US nation-wide survey data in 2004. Combining these data with age-, sex-and EDS-specific mortality rates and disability prevalence estimated from our study, we constructed Sullivan life tables for those with and without EDS. Life expectancy (total, with, and without disability) from age 60 was estimated for those with and without EDS.
   Results: The study participants were on average 64 years old and 47% were men. Those with EDS were more likely to develop disability than those without (OR 1.40, 95% CI 1.01-1.95). The HR for mortality associated with having EDS was 1.43 (95% CI 1.11-1.85). The results from life table analysis suggest that a sixty-year-old individual with EDS had a four-year decrease in disability-free life years, and no change in years lived with disability.
   Conclusions: EDS is associated with higher likelihood of disability, increased risk of mortality, and substantially shorter disability-free life expectancy at age 60. (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Objectives: To evaluate the association of polysomnographic parameters with clinical symptom severity in Robin sequence (RS) patients.
   Methods: All patients diagnosed as presenting with RS at Hospital de Clinicas de Porto Alegre from October 2012 to June 2016 were enrolled. They were classified as isolated RS, RS-plus, and syndromic RS. Polysomnography (PSG) was performed, except for those patients in need of respiratory support. Symptom severity was evaluated as defined by the Cole et al. classification. Ordinal OR (for the chance of increase in one grade on the clinical severity scale) and R-2 (determination coefficient from ordinal logistic regression) were computed from data analysis.
   Results: A total of 80 participants were enrolled in the study. Fifty-five of these were able to undergo polysomnography. Worsening of the studied PSG parameters was associated with increase in clinical severity grading, as follows: desaturation index (OR 1.27; 95% CI; 1.07-1.51; R-2 = 19.8%; p = 0.006); apnea/hypopnea Index (OR 1.13; 95% CI; 1.01-1.26; R-2 = 12.5%; p = 0.02); sleep mean oxygen saturation (OR 0.16; 95% CI; 0.05-0.52; R-2 = 22.6%; p = 0.002); oxygen saturation nadir (OR 0.73; 95% CI; 0.56-0.96; R-2 = 10.0%; p = 0.02); percentage of time with oxygen saturation <90% (OR 9.49; 95% CI; 1.63-55.31, R-2 = 37.6%; p = 0.012); and percentage of time presenting with obstruction (OR 2.5; 95% CI; 1.31-4.76; R-2 = 25.1%; p = 0.006).
   Conclusions: Polysomnography parameters were associated with severity of clinical manifestations in patients with RS. Oxyhemoglobin saturation-based parameters had surprisingly significant R-2 values. Therefore, those parameters, which have traditionally been undervalued in other clinical settings, should also be assessed in the polysomnographic evaluation of RS patients. (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB Objective/Background: Several studies have reported an association between 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH) D) levels and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) patients. The objective of the current study was to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis of these studies and report the findings.
   Patients/Methods: Authors searched for studies (through January 1, 2017) reporting 25(OH) D serum levels in OSA patients. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement was followed.
   Results: Fourteen studies with 4937 subjects met inclusion criteria. There were 1513 controls and 3424 OSA patients. The 25(OH) D serum levels for controls and mild OSA patients were 28.16 +/- 9.39 ng/mL (95% CI 27.64, 28.68) and 27.41 +/- 9.42 ng/mL (95% CI 26.87, 27.95), respectively. The 25(OH) D serum levels for controls and moderate OSA patients were 28.21 +/- 9.38 ng/mL (95% CI 27.70, 28.72) and 25.48 +/- 10.34 ng/mL (95% CI 24.68, 26.28), respectively. The 25(OH) D serum levels for controls and severe OSA patients were 28.32 +/- 9.65 ng/mL (95% CI 27.80, 28.84) and 21.88 +/- 10.24 ng/mL (95% CI 21.08, 22.68), respectively. Using randomeffects modeling, the 25(OH) D serum levels were decreased for patients with OSA when compared to control groups (mean differences were -2.7% for mild OSA, -10.1% for moderate OSA and -17.4% for severe OSA).
   Conclusions: There was a relative insufficiency in serum 25(OH) D levels among OSA patients compared to control patients, which was incrementally exacerbated with increasing severity of sleep apnea. It was unclear whether a low 25(OH) D was a risk factor for OSA or if OSA was a risk factor for 25(OH) D. It was also possible that the association between 25(OH) D and OSA was due to body mass index (BMI). Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Global precipitation products are very important datasets in flow simulations, especially in poorly gauged regions. Uncertainties resulting from precipitation products, hydrological models and their combinations vary with time and data magnitude, and undermine their application to flow simulations. However, previous studies have not quantified these uncertainties individually and explicitly. This study developed an ensemble-based dynamic Bayesian averaging approach (e-Bay) for deterministic discharge simulations using multiple global precipitation products and hydrological models. In this approach, the joint probability of precipitation products and hydrological models being correct is quantified based on uncertainties in maximum and mean estimation, posterior probability is quantified as functions of the magnitude and timing of discharges, and the law of total probability is implemented to calculate expected discharges. Six global fine-resolution precipitation products and two hydrological models of different complexities are included in an illustrative application. e-Bay can effectively quantify uncertainties and therefore generate better deterministic discharges than traditional approaches (weighted average methods with equal and varying weights and maximum likelihood approach). The mean Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency values of e-Bay are up to 0.97 and 0.85 in training and validation periods respectively, which are at least 0.06 and 0.13 higher than traditional approaches. In addition, with increased training data, assessment criteria values of e-Bay show smaller fluctuations than traditional approaches and its performance becomes outstanding. The proposed e-Bay approach bridges the gap between global precipitation products and their pragmatic applications to discharge simulations, and is beneficial to water resources management in ungauged or poorly gauged regions across the world.

AB The past decade has witnessed a resurgence in innovation awards, in particular of grand innovation prizes (GIPs) which are rewards to innovators developing technologies reaching performance goals and requiring breakthrough solutions. GIPs typically do not preclude the winner also obtaining patent rights. This is in stark contrast with mainstream economics of innovation theories where prizes and patents are substitute ways to generate revenue and encourage innovation. Building on the management of innovation literature which stresses the difficulty to specify ex-ante all the technical features of the winning technologies, we develop a model in which innovative effort is multi-dimensional and only a subset of innovation tasks can be measured and contracted upon. We show that in this environment patent rights and cash rewards are complements, and that GIPS are often preferable to patent races or prizes requiring technologies to be placed in the public domain. Moreover, our model uncovers a tendency for patent races to encourage speed of discovery over quality of innovation, which can be corrected by GIPs. We explore robustness to endogenous entry, costly public funds, and incomplete information by GIP organizers on the surplus created by the technology.

AB Innovation activities in the German business sector showed two opposing trends over the past two decades: While total innovation expenditures grew substantially, the number of firms conducting innovation activities fell sharply. In this paper, we explore the mechanisms behind the declining trend in the share of innovation active firms. Considering both input (R&D activities) and output (introduction of innovations), we model innovation decisions as a multi-stage process using continuous-time Markov chain analysis. We base our analyses on a 14 year panel from the German part of the Community Innovation Survey. Our results show that smaller firms and firms in sectors with less innovation competition are more likely to stop innovating. We also show that better financial situation and public funding can mitigate the trend towards a falling share of innovating and R&D performing firms.

AB Government is one of the determinants for innovation capacity although its role and degree of involvement in innovation is debatable. Government intervention can be vital in supporting R&D and innovation as market alone cannot provide adequate incentives for knowledge production. Degrees of government intervention, however, vary in different economies and range from directive intervention by actively advising industrial policy and investing in selected areas, to facilitative intervention by creating positive environment and providing public goods for industry. This study uses Singapore and Hong Kong as two cases to explore the influence of government intervention on innovation performance. Singapore is known for strong government intervention while Hong Kong is famous for its positive non-intervention policy that minimizes the power of government in influencing the market. The comparison shows that innovation activities in Singapore are largely policy driven and dominated by big players, while in Hong Kong industry innovation is less active but the local industry has a dynamic innovation base contributed by small firms. Using a difference-in-differences analysis of USPTO patents filed by Singapore and Hong Kong, we find evidence for the effectiveness of government intervention on enhancing the technological significance and scope of innovation. The findings could shed light on the implication of government involvement in innovation.

AB This study empirically examines whether the research and development (R&D) activities of foreign-owned firms in Japan differ notably from the R&D activities of domestically-owned firms based on a firm-level panel dataset. Our study carefully disentangles the significant differences in R&D investment behavior of subsidiaries due to three different reasons: having a foreign parent, corporate group affiliation, and the degree of relatedness between business units. The results reveal the following. First, firms that are majority-owned by another firm are less active in R&D than independent firms. Second, foreign ownership does not matter if the parent firm is from a G7 country, but R&D intensity is significantly and positively associated with foreign ownership if the parent firm is from a non-G7 country. Finally, for subsidiaries whose business is related to that of their parent firm, the R&D intensity is lower if the parent is a domestic firm, but higher if it is a foreign firm. These findings imply that globalization and the integration of firms may not only affect production patterns and global supply chains, but may also have an important impact on the level of domestic R&D activities.

AB The most prominent framework for studying socio-technical transitions to date is the multi-level perspective (MLP). While appreciated for its flexibility and usefulness for studying socio-technical transitions it has not been without its critics. In this paper we focus on the ontological foundations of the MLP and its (in)ability to explain transitions and how they come about. The purpose is to initiate development of an explanatory theory for socio-technical transitions, by carrying out an immanent critique of the ontological foundations of the MLP together with a methodological critique. We show that the ontological foundations of the MLP to a large extent inhibits explanatory capacity. The argument is fourfold: since structure and agency are understood as inseparable, (i) the causal influence of material properties are undervalued, and (ii) different degrees of structural constraint and freedom of actors are ignored. As a consequence (iii) transitions are reduced to shifts in the maturity and spread of socio-cognitive rules, without analysis of systemic change. Moreover, (iv) mechanisms are reduced to recurring patterns of events which cannot explain why some transitions fail while others succeed. To remedy these limitations we outline alternative critical realist foundations for transitions theory.

AB We investigate how host country R&D influences ownership decisions made by technology-intensive multinational enterprises (MNEs) as they internationalize. We draw from institutional and resource based theories, as well as literature on agglomeration and clusters, and construct a unique dataset of 1324 foreign investments recorded by German automobile manufacturers between 2005 and 2012 for our empirical tests. We find that in host countries that are cluster-abundant there will be a greater likelihood that technology-intensive MNEs will adopt joint ventures over wholly-owned subsidiaries, and will more likely use a lower equity stake in any joint venture. We find partial support for the influence of other aspects of host country R&D, including innovation output and inward technology FDI. Various robustness tests and insights from selected cases provide further support. Importantly, findings demonstrate the importance of multi-dimensional characteristics of host country R&D over and above those such as market size, political stability and cultural distance that are more commonly utilized and discussed in the entry strategy literature. The findings have implications for host country policy as well as strategy-makers in MNEs seeking to compete on the basis of globalized R&D.

AB Collaborative relationships are an important anchor of innovative activity, and rates of collaboration in science are on the rise. This research addresses differences in men's and women's collaborative positioning and collaborator characteristics in science, and whether network influences on scientists' future productivity may be contingent on gender. Utilizing co-inventor network relations that span thirty years of global life science patenting across sectors, geographic locations, and technological background, I present trends of men's and women's involvement in patenting and their collaborative characteristics across time. Amidst some network similarities, women are less likely to connect otherwise unconnected inventors (brokerage) and have greater status-asymmetries between themselves and their co-inventors. In multivariate models that include past and future activity, I find that some network benefits are contingent on gender. Men receive greater returns from network positioning for brokerage ties, and when collaborating with men. Women benefit from collaborating with women, and are more likely to collaborate with women, but both men and women collaborate with mostly men. I discuss the implications of these results for innovative growth, as well as for policies that support men's and women's career development.

AB Corporate venture investments are an established means for incumbent firms to access radical innovation. Drawing from a behavioural agency framework, we distinguish two mechanisms that govern the relationship between corporate venture investment and radical innovation, the safety net that corporate sponsors provide and control incentives. While the safety net induces a gap between the radical innovation success of corporate ventures (CVs) and ventures without a corporate sponsor, the superior radical innovation success of CVs decreases with the corporate sponsor's incentives to control the venture. The impact of the safety net and control incentives further depends on the corporate sponsor's position vis-a-vis her aspiration level.

AB The appropriate reference genes are important and essential for reliable results of transcript normalization in real-time qRT-PCR. In the current study, we identified 1203 stably expressed genes from 35,286 genes' expression profiles in developmental fruits of Actinidia chinensis. We manually selected six candidate genes and assessed their expression levels, using two sets of fruit samples of A. chinensis: flesh fruits at four developmental stages and post-harvested fruits. The expression stability of these six genes was assessed by three independent algorithms: geNorm, NormFinder, and BestKeeper. Statistical results indicated these six genes can serve as internal control in both developmental and post-harvested fruits. Among these genes, UBQ_CONJ_E2 (Ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2 36) and TUB_FCB (Tubulin folding cofactor B) were the two best reference genes identified in this study. The identification and validation of these reference genes can be helpful for elucidating the studies of fruit development and post-harvested fruits' storage in A. chinensis and other fruit crops of Actinidiaceae.

AB Background: Acute viral bronchiolitis is the leading cause of hospitalization among infants during the first year of life. Most infants hospitalized for bronchiolitis do not present risk factors and are otherwise healthy. Our objective was to determine the genetic features associated with the risk and a severe course of bronchiolitis.
   Methods: We prospectively evaluated 181 infants with severe bronchiolitis admitted at three hospitals over a 2 year period, who required oxygen therapy. The control group consisted of 536 healthy adults. Patients were evaluated for the presence of comorbidities (premature birth, chronic respiratory disease, and congenital heart disease), underwent nasopharyngeal aspirate testing for virus detection by multiplex-PCR, and SNPs identification in immune response genes. Patient outcomes were assessed.
   Results: We observed association between SNP rs2107538*CCL5 and bronchiolitis caused by respiratory syncytial virus(RSV) and RSV-subtype-A, and between rs1060826*NOS2 and bronchiolitis caused by rhinovirus. SNPs rs4986790*TLR4, rs1898830*TLR2, and rs2228570*VDR were associated with progression to death. SNP rs7656411*TLR2 was associated with length of oxygen use; SNPs rs352162*TLR9, rs187084*TLR9, and rs2280788*CCL5 were associated with requirement for intensive care unit admission; while SNPs rs1927911*TLR4, rs352162*TLR9, and rs2107538*CCL5 were associated with the need for mechanical ventilation.
   Conclusions: Our findings provide some evidence that SNPs in CCL5 and NOS2 are associated with presence of bronchiolitis and SNPs in TLR4, TLR2, TLR9, VDR and CCL5 are associated with severity of bronchiolitis.

AB Inflammatory Bowel disease (IBD) is a widespread pathological condition with clinical heterogeneity and with different levels of severity. Although IBD usually occurs in young adults, onset in childhood and infancy are described in patients within the 10th and second year of age. By genome-wide association studies and meta analysis, several genetic loci have been identified associated with an increased risk of developing IBD in Western populations with variants that may alter the normal mucosa] immunity in the gastrointestinal tract.
   The clinical complexity and the heterogeneity of the IBD phenotype probably reflect the presence of genetic heterogeneity where different genes or combinations of them may be involved, together with environmental factors. We hypothesized that patients with early onset IBD could have either more severe genetic variants in genes associated with [BD or multiple variants in different genes. Under the multifactorial diseases is crucial to consider the small contribution of a single variant in all not only to other small variations in the same gene but also in different genes belonging to the same pathway.
   We performed direct gene sequencing looking for 94 variations in NOD2, ATG16L1, IL23R, IL10R, IL10 and XIAP genes previously shown as correlated with IBD both in multifactorial and in Mendelian models. All variants identified are known in literature as being associated with IBD except for three variants in the genes NOD2, IL10 and IL10RB that even though present in online databases have never been involved in association studies on IBD patients. Moreover, we coupled genetic variants identification with an accurate "in silica" analysis to verify their predictive impact on the protein structure and function. The in-silico prediction of these variants results as benign therefore even if they exhibit a very low frequency in control population being benign, they cannot be considered pathogenic as monogenic disease but fall within the multifactorial range.
   The variants identified in our study partially reflect the association data described in the literature but there are no significant differences with the onset of disease (VEO vs EO-IBD).

AB Portal hypertension is a major cause of mortality and morbidity in cirrhotic patients. In this study, we aimed to analyze the clinical characteristics of Alu-mediated p21 transcriptional regulator (APTR) during transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) procedure. Portal and hepatic venous blood was drawn from 84 patients with liver cirrhosis and portal hypertension before and after TIPS treatment. Then, we detected biochemical, hemodynamic parameters and APTR expression before and after TIPS treatment. Indeed, TIPS treatment could markedly ameliorate the serum blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level and portal vein hemodynamics in cirrhotic patients. We found that portal venous levels of APTR was significantly decreased after TIPS treatment and its aberrant expression levels were positively correlated with Model for End Stage Liver Disease (MELD), portal hepatic venous pressure gradient (PHPG) in patients. Higher APTR expression in portal vein was associated with poor prognosis. APTR level in portal vein was an independent predictors of mortality. Our data indicated that APTR may serve as a novel biomarker for cirrhotic patients with portal hypertension before and after receiving TIPS.

AB Delta Np63 alpha is finely and strictly regulated during embryogenesis and differentiation. Delta Np63 alpha is the only p63 isoform degraded by the proteasome after Ubiquitin and SUMO (Small Ubiquitin-like MOdifier) conjugation. Here, we show that p63 ubiquitylation per se is not the signal triggering p63 proteasomal degradation. Taking advantage of natural Delta Np63 alpha mutants isolated by patients with Split Hand and Foot Malformation IV syndrome, we found that SUMO and Ub modifications are not redundant and both are required to guarantee efficient Delta Np63 alpha degradation. Here, we present evidence that sumoylation and ubiquitylation of Delta Np63 alpha are strongly intertwined, and none of the two can efficiently occur if the other is impaired.

AB DNA methylation plays an important role in regulating gene expression during tissue development and differentiation in eukaryotes. In contrast to domestic animals, epigenetic studies have been seldom conducted in wild animals. In the present study, we conducted the genome-wide profiling of DNA methylation for five tissues of sika deer using the Fluorescence-labeled methylation-sensitive amplified polymorphism (F-MSAP) technique. Overall, a total of 104,131 fragments were amplified including 41,951 methylated fragments using 32 pairs of selected primers. The average incidence of DNA methylation was approximately 38.18% in muscle, 40.32% in heart, 41.86% in liver, 41.20% in lung, and 41.68% in kidney, respectively. Also, the significant differences of the DNA methylation levels were found between the different tissue types (P < 0.05), which indicates that the differences of genome-wide DNA methylation levels may be related to gene expression during tissue development and differentiation. In addition, 37 tissue-specific differentially methylated regions (T-DMRs) were identified and recovered by MSAP in five tissues, and were further confirmed by Southern blot analysis. Our study presents the first look at the T-DMRs in sika deer and represents an initial step towards understanding of epigenetic regulatory mechanism underlying tissue development and differentiation in sika deer.

AB Fatty acid synthase (FASN) is an enzyme involved with fat deposition and fatty acid composition in cattle. This study was conducted to detect single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the FASN gene and explore their relationships with ultrasound carcass traits in order to assess the potential use of the FASN gene for the breeding selection of Qinchuan cattle for desirable carcass traits. The frequencies of SNP g.12740C > T, g.13192T > C and g.13232C > T were identified in 525 individual Qinchuan cattle which were also assessed for backfat depth, eye muscle area and intramuscular fat by ultrasound. According to the PIC values, g.13192T > C possessed an intermediate polymorphism (0.25 < PIC < 0.5). The SNPs of g.13232C > T, g.12740C > T possessed low polymorphism (PIC < 0.25). Chi-square tests showed that g.13192T > C were in Hardy-Weinberg disequilibrium (c2 < c0.052). Two SNPs were found to be associated with variation in ultrasound carcass traits. The H2H2 diplotypes had a greater back fat depth than H-1-H-1, H-1 H-4 and H-1 H-2 (P < 0.01). The TT genotype at g.13192T > C was associated with a greater eye muscle area and the TT genotype at g.13232C > T was associated with greater intramuscular fat. When these genotypes were combined there was no difference in eye muscle area and intramuscular fat between the diplotypes. The H2H2 diplotype was associated with carcass traits that are likely to provide economic advantage in Qinchuan cattle. Variations in the FASN genes and their corresponding genotypes may be considered as molecular markers for economic traits in cattle breeding.

AB Ultraviolet-B (UVB) irradiation induces oxidative stress in plant cells due to the generation of excessive reactive oxygen species. Mores alba L. (M. abla) is an important medicinal plant used for the treatment of human diseases. Also, its leaves are widely used as food for silkworms. In our previous research, we found that a high level of UVB irradiation with dark incubation led to the accumulation of secondary metabolites in M. able leaf. The aim of the present study was to describe and compare M. alba leaf transcriptomics with different treatments (control, UVB, UVB + dark). Leaf transcripts from M. alba were sequenced using an Illumina Hiseq 2000 system, which produced 14.27 Gb of data including 153,204,462 paired-end reads among the three libraries. We de novo assembled 133,002 transcripts with an average length of 1270 bp and filtered 69,728 non-redundant unigenes. A similarity search was performed against the non-redundant National Center of Biotechnology Information (NCBI) protein database, which returned 41.08% hits. Among the 20,040 unigenes annotated in UniProtKB/SwissProt database, 16,683 unigenes were assigned 102,232 gene ontology terms and 6667 unigenes were identified in 287 known metabolic pathways. Results of differential gene expression analysis together with real-time quantitative PCR tests indicated that UVB irradiation with dark incubation enhanced the fiavonoid biosynthesis in M. alba leaf. Our findings provided a valuable proof for a better understanding of the metabolic mechanism under abiotic stresses in M. alba leaf.

AB Genetic rearrangements involving androgen-regulated transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) and genes from the ETS transcription factor family, most commonly ERG and ETV1, result in alteration that responsible for oncogenic activity in prostate cancer (PC). The aims of the present study were to: 1) investigate the frequency of these fusion transcripts in prostate tissue samples obtained from patients diagnosed with atypical small acinar proliferation (ASAP), 2) determine any clinical significance of T2E expression at the RNA level in predicting PC detection in subsequent biopsies, and 3) evaluate expression of the PC marker, alpha-methylacyl-CoA racemase (AMACR), according to T2E status by real-time quantitative reverse transcription PCR (RT-qPCR). T2E transcripts were detected in 31.7% (n = 20) of the patients examined, and this was significantly associated with subsequent detection of PC in ASAP patients with a prostate specific antigen (PSA) level of 4-10 ng/ml (p = 0.045). AMACR expression was also significantly higher in the patients who were diagnosed with PC in subsequent biopsies than in the patients who were not diagnosed with PC (p = 0.034) and in T2E-positive ASAP patients (p = 0.002) compared to T2E-negative ASAP patients. Although these results need to be further clinically validated, we suggest that the presence of T2E transcript, in association with higher AMACR expression, is an indicator of PC risk from a T2E-positive focus or an unsampled malignant gland adjacent to a T2E-positive site in ASAP lesions.

AB Long non-coding RNAs (IncRNAs) have been wildly verified to modulate multiple tumorigenesis, especially nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). In present study, we aim to investigate the role of IncRNA FOXD2-AS1 in the NPC carcinogenesis. It was indicated that FOXD2-AS1 was markedly increased in NPC tissues and cells in comparison to their corresponding controls. Moreover, the aberrant overexpression of FOXD2-AS1 indicated the poor prognosis of NPC patients. Silence of FOXD2-AS1 was able to repress NPC cell growth in vitro while overexpression of FOXD2-AS1 inversed this process. Moreover, in vivo tumor xenografts were established using CNE-1/SUNE-1 cells to investigate the function of FOXD2-AS1 in NSCLC tumorigenesis. Rescue assay was performed to further confirm that FOXD2-AS1 contributed to NPC progression by regulating miR-363-5p/S100A1 signal pathway. Taken together, our study discovered the oncogenic role of FOXD2-AS1 in clinical specimens and cellular experiments, showing the potential FOXD2-AS1/miR-363-5p/S100A1 pathway. This results and findings provide a novel insight for NPC tumorigenesis.

AB The production of inflammatory mediators by epithelial cells in inflammatory lung diseases may represent an important target for the anti-inflammatory effects of glucocorticoids. Activator protein-1 is a major activator of inflammatory genes and has been proposed as a target for inhibition by glucocorticoids. We have used human pulmonary type-II A549 cells to examine the effect of dexamethasone on the phorbol ester (PMA)/Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induced pro-inflammatory cytokines and AP-1 factors. A549 cells were treated with and without PMA or LPS or dexamethasone and the cell viability and nitric oxide production was measured by MTT assay and Griess reagent respectively. Expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and AP-1 factors mRNA were measured using semi quantitative RT-PCR. The PMA/LPS treated cells show significant 2-3 fold increase in the mRNA levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1 beta, IL-2, IL-6, IL-8 and TNF-alpha), cyclo-oxygenase-2 (COX-2) and specific AP-1 factors (c-Jun, c-Fos and Jun-D). Whereas, pretreatment of cells with dexamethasone significantly inhibited the LPS induced nitric oxide production and PMA/LPS induced mRNAs expression of above pro-inflammatory cytokines, COX-2 and AP-1 factors. Cells treated with dexamethasone alone at both the concentrations inhibit the mRNAs expression of IL-1 beta, IL-6 and TNF-alpha compared to control. Our study reveals that dexamethasone decreased the mRNAs expression of c-Jun and c-Fos available for AP-1 formation suggested that AP-1 is the probable key transcription factor involved in the anti-inflammatory activity of dexamethasone. This may be an important molecular mechanism of steroid action in asthma and other chronic inflammatory lung diseases which may be useful for treatment of lung inflammatory diseases.

AB Phytochelatin synthase (PCS) is an enzyme involved in the synthesis of phytochelatins, cysteine-rich peptides which play a key role in heavy metal (HM) detoxification of plants. Mulberry (Morus L.), one of the most ecologically and economically important tree genera, has the potential to remediate HM-contaminated soils. However, genes involved in HM detoxification in Morus, such as the PCS genes, have not been identified and characterized. In this study, we identified two Moms notabilis PCS genes based on a genome-wide analysis of the Morus genome database. Full-length MnPCS1 and MnPCS2 cDNAs were 1509 and 1491 bp long, respectively. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) analysis revealed that, under 200 mu M Zn2+ or either 30 or 100 mu M Cd2+ stress, the relative expression of each of the two MaPCSs (from Mows alba) was induced in root, stem and leaf tissues within 24 h of exposure to the metals, with Cd2 inducing expression more strongly than did Zn2+. Based on the analysis of total root length and fresh weight of seedlings, overexpression of MnPCS1 and MnPCS2 in Arabidopsis and tobacco enhanced Zn2+/Cd2+ tolerance in most transgenic individuals. The results of transgenic Arabidopsis lines overexpressing MnPCS1 and MnPCS2 suggest that MnPCS1 play a more important role in Cd detoxification than MnPCS2. Zn2+/Cd-2+ concentrations in both shoots and roots of the transgenic Arabidopsis seedlings were higher than in wild type (WT) seedlings at two Zn2+/Cd2+ concentrations. In addition, there was a positive correlation between Zn accumulation and the expression level of MnPCS1 or MnPCS2. Our results indicated that the Morus PCS1 and PCS2 genes play important roles in HM stress tolerance and accumulation, providing a useful genetic resource for enhancing tolerance to HMs and for increasing the HM phytoremediation potential of these plants.

AB Background: Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is still a serious public health problem. Understanding risk factors associated with development of HBV is greatly important. Numerous studies focus on relationship between vitamin D receptor (VDR) polymorphisms (Taql, Fokl, Apal, Bsml) and the risk of HBV infection in different ethnic groups. However the results published so far are inconsistent. The aim of this study is to quantify the association between VDR polymorphisms with HBV infection by meta-analysis approach.
   Methods: A systematic search was performed in Pubmed, Embase, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Database of Chinese Scientific and Technical Periodicals (VIP), and WANFANG. All the relevant studies were published up to October 2016.
   Results: Finally, 15 published studies included 4218 cases and 2298 controls were included in this meta-analysis. It is interesting to note that Fokl FF tends to be a risk factor for HBV infection [FF vs. ff: P < 0.01, OR (95%CI) = 1.54 (1.19-2.00), I-2 = 0.0%], with no heterogeneity. In addition, genotype Ff and allele F could increase HBV infection risk [Ff vs. ff: P < 0.01, OR (95%CI) = 1.39 (1.13-1.72); F vs. f: P = 0.02, OR (95%CI) = 1.23(1.04-1.45)]. However, no associations were found about VDR TaqI, Apal and Bsml polymorphisms with HBV infection based on each comparison model.
   Conclusion: This meta-analysis indicates that Fokl genotype FF, Ff and allele F increase the risk of HBV infection. All these results support the notion that VDR Fokl genotype might has potential role in HBV susceptibility.

AB Genomic rearrangements, such as intragenic deletions and duplications, are the most prevalent types of mutation in the DMD gene, and DMD mutations underlie Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) and Becker muscular dystrophy (BMD). Using multiplex ligation dependent probe amplification (MLPA) and DMD gene-targeted sequencing, we performed a molecular characterization of two cases of complex noncontiguous duplication rearrangements that involved inverted duplications. The breakpoint sequences were analyzed to investigate the mechanisms of the rearrangement. The two cases shared the same duplication events (Dup-nml-Dup/inv), and both involved microhomology and small insertions at the breakpoints. Additionally, in case 1, SNP sequencing results indicated that the de novo duplication mutation arose in the allele that originated from the grandfather. This study has identified a novel type of DMD complex rearrangement and provides insight into the molecular basis of this genomic rearrangement.

AB Bipolar disorder is a mental illness with lifetime prevalence of about 1%. Previous genetic studies have identified multiple chromosomal linkage regions and candidate genes that might be associated with bipolar disorder. The present study aimed to identify potential susceptibility variants for bipolar disorder using 6 related case samples from a four-generation family. A combination of exome sequencing and linkage analysis was performed to identify potential susceptibility variants for bipolar disorder. Our study identified a list of five potential candidate genes for bipolar disorder. Among these five genes, GRID1(Glutamate Receptor Delta-1 Subunit), which was previously reported to be associated with several psychiatric disorders and brain related traits, is particularly interesting. Variants with functional significance in this gene were identified from two cousins in our bipolar disorder pedigree. Our findings suggest a potential role for these genes and the related rare variants in the onset and development of bipolar disorder in this one family. Additional research is needed to replicate these findings and evaluate their patho-biological significance.

AB Transcriptome studies on Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis have recently contributed to the understanding about this microorganism's survival mechanisms in various hostile conditions. The gene expression profile of the C. pseudotuberculosis strain 1002 (Ovis biovar), has revealed genes that are possible candidates responsible for its maintenance in adverse environments, such as those found in the host. In another strain of this bacterium, 258 (Equi biovar), a high temperature condition was simulated, in order to verify which genes are responsible for promoting the persistence of the bacterium in these conditions, since it tolerates temperatures higher than 40 degrees C, despite being a mesophilic bacterium. It was possible to generate a list of genes using RNAseq technology that possibly contribute to the survival of the bacteria in this hostile environment. A total of 562 genes were considered as differentially expressed, then, after the fold-change cutoff, 113 were considered induced and 114 repressed, resulting in a total of 227 genes. Therefore, hypothetical proteins presented a fold change above 6, and genes characteristically in control for this type of stress, such as hspR, grpE, and dnaK, presented a fold change above 3. The clpB gene, a chaperone, drew attention due to presenting a fold change above 3 and located in a pathogenicity island. These genes may contribute towards efficient solutions to the effects caused by ulcerative lymphangitis in equines, thus attenuating the damage it causes to agribusiness.

AB Although human and mouse genetics have largely contributed to the better understanding of the mechanisms underlying skeletogenesis, much more remains to be uncovered. In this regard alternative and complementary systems have been sought and cell systems capable of in vitro calcification have been developed to study the mechanisms underlying bone formation. In gilthead seabream (Sparus aurata), a gene coding for an unknown protein that is strongly up-regulated during extracellular matrix (ECM) mineralization of a pre-osteoblast cell line was recently identified as a potentially important player in bone formation. In silico analysis of the deduced protein revealed the presence of domains typical of short-chain dehydrogenase/reductases (SDR). Closely related to carbonyl reductase 1, seabream protein belongs to a novel subfamily of SDR proteins with no orthologs in mammals. Analysis of gene expression by qPCR confirmed the strong up-regulation of sdr-like expression during in vitro mineralization but also revealed high expression levels in calcified tissues. A possible role for Sdr-like in osteoblast and bone metabolism was further evidenced through (i) the localization by in situ hybridization of sdr-like transcript in pre-osteoblasts of the operculum and (ii) the regulation of sdr-like gene transcription by Runx2 and retinoic acid receptor, two regulators of osteoblast differentiation and mineralization. Expression data also indicated a role for Sdr-like in gastrointestinal tract homeostasis and during gilthead seabream development at gastrulation and metamorphosis. This study reports a new subfamily of short-chain dehydrogenases/reductases in vertebrates and, for the first time, provides evidence of a role for SDRs in bone metabolism, osteoblast differentiation and/or tissue mineralization.

AB Nitrogen is a key nutrient for all cell forms. Most organisms respond to nitrogen scarcity by slowing down their growth rate. On the contrary, our previous studies have shown that Papiliotrema laurentii strain RY1 has a robust growth under nitrogen starvation. To understand the global regulation that leads to such an extraordinary response, we undertook a de novo approach for transcriptome analysis of the yeast. Close to 33 million sequence reads of high quality for nitrogen limited and enriched condition were generated using Illumina NextSeq500. Trinity analysis and clustered transcripts annotation of the reads produced 17,611 unigenes, out of which 14,157 could be annotated. Gene Ontology term analysis generated 44.92% cellular component terms, 39.81% molecular function terms and 15.24% biological process terms. The most over represented pathways in general were translation, carbohydrate metabolism, amino acid metabolism, general metabolism, folding, sorting, degradation followed by transport and catabolism, nucleotide metabolism, replication and repair, transcription and lipid metabolism. A total of 4256 Single Sequence Repeats were identified. Differential gene expression analysis detected 996 P-significant transcripts to reveal transmembrane transport, lipid homeostasis, fatty acid catabolism and translation as the enriched terms which could be essential for Papiliotrema laurentii strain RY1 to adapt during nitrogen deprivation. Transcriptome data was validated by quantitative real-time PCR analysis of twelve transcripts. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of Papiliotrema laurentii strain RY1 transcriptome which would play a pivotal role in understanding the biochemistry of the yeast under acute nitrogen stress and this study would be encouraging to initiate extensive investigations into this Papiliotrema system.

AB Colorectal cancer is one of the most common malignant tumours. Competitive endogenous RNA (ceRNA) networks have been hypothesized, in which various RNAs regulate each other's expression using microRNA response elements (MREs). Recent evidence has highlighted the crucial regulatory roles of ceRNA networks in colorectal cancer. In this review, we summarize the present research methods as well as the currently known ceRNA competitors and targets in colorectal cancer. In addition, we discuss the significance of ceRNA and shortcomings of current studies of colorectal cancer.

AB Aberrant expression of miRNAs has been observed in a variety of human cancers. In this study, we reported that miR-564 was down-regulated in human osteosarcoma (OS) cell lines and patients. Overexpression of miR-564 in OS cells suppressed the cell proliferation and induced cell apoptosis. Mechanistically, we identified Akt as a direct target of miR-564. Highly expressed miR-564 decreased the expression of Akt at both mRNA and protein level and consequently, inhibited the essential role of Akt in the glycolysis of OS cells. Notably, restoring the expression of Akt in miR-564 overexpressing cells recovered the glucose metabolism and cell growth. These results suggested that miR-564 inhibited the glycolysis and cell proliferation through directly targeting Akt, which highlighted the potential application of miR-564-Akt axis in the treatment of osteosarcoma.

AB Light is one of the most important environmental factors for the growth and development of plants. To adapt to changes in day length, the photoreception and transmission of the light signals in plants mainly depend on the various light receptor proteins. The PAS/LOV protein (PLP) has a PAS domain in the N-terminal and LOV domain in the C-terminal and has been confirmed as a new type of blue light receptor in Arabidopsis thaliana. However, the role of its counterpart in soybean remains largely unclear. In this study, the expression pattern of the GmPLP1 under different light qualities was determined by real-time RT-PCR analysis using the cultivar `DongNong 42', a photosensitive soybean cultivar, suggesting that GrnPLP1 was affected by the circadian clock and was a dark induced gene. Moreover, the mRNA abundance increased significantly under blue light. Further analysis revealed that overexpression of GmPLP1 displayed the inhibition of hypocotyl elongation under blue light, and the expression of CRY1, CRY2, CKL3, CKL4, BIT1, and HY5 were simultaneously increased in GrnPLP1-transgenic Arabidopsis, suggesting that the shortened hypocotyl was associated with the up-regulation of these genes. Taken together, our results suggest that GmPLPI, which is a new possible type of blue light photoreceptor in soybean, plays an important role in the blue light signaling pathway.

AB We illustrated the descriptive aspects of codon usage of some important human genes and their expression potential in E. coli. By comparing the results of various codon usage parameters, effects that are due to selection and mutational pressures have been deciphered. The variation in GC3s explains a significant proportion of the variation in codon usage patterns. The codons CGC, CGG, CTG and GCG showed strong positive correlation with GC3, which suggested that codon usage had been influenced by GC bias. We also found that ACC (Thr, RSCU1.77), GCC (Ala, RSCU-1.67), CCC (Pro, RSCU-1.54), TCC (Ser, RSCU-1.47) were frequently used which signified that C was common at 2nd and 3rd codon positions. Correspondence analysis revealed that Fl axis had significant correlation with various GC contents suggesting that compositional properties under mutation pressure might affect codon usage bias. Nc-GC3 plot analysis suggested that both mutation pressure and natural selection might affect the codon usage bias which is also supported by neutrality plot analysis. The dinucleotide CT, TG and AG were significantly over -represented and CG, TA, AT, TT, and GT were underrepresented due to high rate of spontaneous mutation resulting from cytosine deamination.

AB Liquidus temperature (T-L) was measured for 38 simulated high-level waste borosilicate glasses covering a Hanford composition region, using optical microscopy and crystal-fraction extrapolation methods to analyze isothermally heat-treated specimens. The glasses encompassed a one-component-at-a-time variation of 16 components from a representative Hanford HLW simulant baseline composition. The T-L values ranged from 1006 degrees C to 1603 degrees C. First-order models were fit to data to obtain component effects on T-L (per 1 mass% additions) and then the components were grouped into three categories: T-L-increasing components [i.e., Cr2O3 (264 degrees C), "Others" (minor components, 163 degrees C), oxides of noble metals (137 degrees C), NiO (91 degrees C), as well as Al2O3 and Fe2O3 (similar to 19-21 degrees C)]; T-L-decreasing components [i.e., K2O (-26 degrees C), Na2O (-41 degrees C), and Li2O (-68 degrees C)]; and those of little effect [i.e., MnO, P2O5, ZrO2, F, Bi2O3, SiO2, B2O3, and CaO (9 to -12 degrees C)]. Also presented are temperatures at which 1 vol% of spinel is at equilibrium with the melt (T-1%) as these values are considered relevant to the Hanford Tank Waste Treatment and Immobilization Plant. The measured and estimated values are compared and contrasted and the effect of T-L and T-1% on glass formulation is discussed. The different methods for measuring T-L are compared and contrasted.

X-ray diffraction analysis (XRD) and Fourier Transform infrared analysis (FTIR) were used to determine the structural properties of the fabricated glass. XRD results confirmed that the prepared glass is amorphous. Density and molar volume of the glass were measured and calculated. The values of the density increase with increase of dopant concentration while molar volume decreases accordingly. Ultraviolet visible spectroscopy analysis (UV-Vis) was used to determine the optical properties of the prepared glass. The refractive index, molar refraction, molar electronic polarizability, metallization criterion, indirect optical energy band gap and Urbach energy were also calculated and analysed. The refractive index was found to increase with increase of holmium ion Ho3+ concentration, optical energy band gap decreases while electronic polarizability increases in conformity with increase of refractive index as the concentration of the dopant increases.

AB The study aimed at preparing Ag-doped bioactive glass (BG) nanoparticles containing 5 wt% Ag2O using a new modified Stober method (Ag-BGm) and the conventional sol-gel method (Ag-BGsg). The aim of employing the new Ag-doping mechanism is to implement a relatively short process to incorporate higher concentration of silver (Ag+) ions in an attempt to combine the antibacterial activity of silver with the bioactivity of BG. SEM and TEM micrographs showed that Ag-BGm nanoparticles were mondispersed, and spherical, while Ag-BGsg nanoparticles were formed of highly porous irregular agglomerated particles. A significantly higher silicon, calcium and silver ions release from the Ag-BGsg was evident, as compared to Ag-BGm, in deionized water (DIW). In vitro bioactivity test showed rapid bioactive properties of Ag-BGsg in simulated body fluid (SBF), as compared to Ag-BGm. Both BGs showed antibacterial effect against E. coil O157: H7 wild type strain 93111 and S. aureus ATCC 25923 as evident by the disc diffusion assay, but Ag-BGsg showed significantly higher mean inhibition zone compared to Ag-BGm. It may be concluded that both Ag-BGsg and Ag-BGm has the potential to be used as bone substitute materials with the Ag-BGsg being more promising due to its high bioactivity and antibacterial effect.

AB High proportions of the amorphous phases with minor and variable amounts of crystalline phases (most commonly mullite and quartz) are the main components of pulverized coal fly ash (PCFA). As for the amorphous phase, it can be further subdivided into amorphous aluminum-silicon matrix (AASM) and amorphous silicon (AS), which show different reaction activity during subsequent applications. In the present work, a more comprehensive approach to evaluate the relative content of crystalline and amorphous phases in PCFA was proposed and verified. The results showed that the AS in PCFA can be removed by sodium hydroxide solution under certain leaching conditions, such as NaOH(aq) concentration ((<)15%) and temperature ((<)80 degrees C). The terminating point of the removal of AS was marked by the forming of hydroxysodalite (Na8Al6Si6O24(OH)(2)(H2O)(2)) in desilicated PCFA (De-PCFA). Based on the Rietveld method, the quantitative analysis of crystalline and amorphous phases in PCFA and De-PCFA was performed in turn; then the relative content of crystalline (mullite, quartz) and amorphous (AS, AASM) phases in PCFA can be obtained by calculation.

AB Tellurite glasses from TeO2-Bi2O3-ZnO-PbO quaternary system were prepared using a conventional melt quenching method and its glass-forming region corresponding to 10% molar of ZnO was determined. A series of transparent glass samples were selected and their structure information were investigated. Differential scanning calorimetry, Raman scattering, Infrared spectroscopy and UV visible absorption spectroscopy were applied to study the glass transition and crystallization temperature, structural and optical properties. The linear refractive indexes at 632.8 nm, 1064 nm and 1552 nm were tested. And the main objective of this study was to investigate the different influence of PbO and Bi2O3 on the structure and optical properties of the glass. Consequently, lead acts as a network modifier even at low content. Although, it could form PbO4 tetrahedra when its content is > 14%, it only can be asserted that lead acts as an intermediate role between modifier and network former at high lead content.

AB In this paper, the densification mechanism of two titanophosphate glasses (binary 73TiO(2)-27P(2)O(5) and ternary 68TiO(2)-5Al(2)O(3)-27P(2)O(5)) is investigated. The glasses are densified by isostatic N-2-mediated pressure treatment at elevated temperature and the pressure-induced structural changes are studied by neutron and X-ray total scattering analyses. The medium range structure change is revealed from the change in the first sharp diffraction peak (FSDP), where the density increase by pressurization is correlated with the decreased medium range repeating spacing calculated from the position of FSDP. The hot compression treatment also increases the medium range order, as shown by the increased correlation length calculated from the width of FSDP. The short range structure changes are examined by separating P-O and Ti-O pair distribution functions (PDF) using differential neutron and X-ray PDFs. Pressurization is also found to increase the coordination number of Ti, as previously observed for other network formers in densified glasses.

AB The paper presents the results of investigations of the temperature dependencies of pyroelectric coefficient and thermodepolarization currents of pyroelectric polymer films (hydrophobic VDF/TrFE copolymer and hydrophilic Langmuir fihns of azo compounds), which were prepared using water. The anomalies of these properties were observed at 4, 28, 35, 45 degrees C for films of azo compounds and 20, 35, 49, 72 and 100 degrees C for VDF/TrFE. These temperature points are close to temperatures of anomalies of physical properties of water. At the listed temperature points, water clusters and the molecule itself are destroyed. Similar anomalies have been previously observed in crystallohydrates, "polymer-water" systems and ferroelectrics of Triglycine Sulphate family, in the structure of which there is a network of OH center dot center dot center dot O hydrogen bonds of the same length as in water. The key property of the hydrogen bond is the presence of discrete protons energy levels, which at stepwise heating (slow kinetics) leads to the transformation or destruction of the hydrogen-bonding network, as well as to the refilling of proton energy levels in the double minimum potential, the release of deep traps, and to the change of charge carrier types, their mobility and conducting paths.

AB The response of glass to a scratch experiment is first reviewed. Then the influence of the applied load on the microcracking pattern, the apparent friction coefficient, and the strength (post scratch test) are studied and discussed for a soda-lime-silica glass (standard window glass composition). As the normal load increases, the depth of the radial crack seems to stabilize at about 100 pm length. Correlatively it is observed that the residual strength of the scratched glass remains at about 40 MPa whatever the scratch load above 0.5 N. Generally, this work contributes theoretically in the understanding of the existing factor controlling scratch in glasses.

AB Iron and copper are immiscible elements, but can be combined in the presence of a third element such as aluminium or cerium. We varied the additions of immiscible Fe and Cu (ratio y) in the stoichiometric Al20.5Ce41.5(FeyCu1-y)(38) alloys in order to trace their impact on the structure, microstructure, thermal properties and magnetism. By powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD), we found that Fe-rich alloys (0.87 <= y <= 1) do not completely hinder crystallisation and yield nanocrystalline precipitates. Cu-rich alloys completely vitrify for 0 <= y <= 0.74 and exhibit a characteristic broad hump in PXRD patterns. DSC shows that Cu-rich alloys exhibit a oticeably lower crystallisation temperature T-x of about 510 K, liquidus temperature T-1 at approximately 900 K and a more pronounced drop Delta of the heat flux at the glass transition temperature T-g. These criteria indicate that Cu-rich alloys are better glass formers. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) shows that the specimens with y = 0 and y = 0.34 are composed of an amorphous matrix with minor impurities of CeO2 nanocrystals, which can only be observed via transmission electron microscopy. However, these nanocrystals do not interfere with the formation of the glassy phase and are therefore inert. Magnetic measurements show that Fe-rich alloys possess higher magnetisation at maximum field (M-max (H)), peaking at 3.3 and 3 emu/g for y = 1 and y = 0.87, respectively. From ferromagnetism in the latter two alloys, the behaviour turns to paramagnetism for 0 <= y <= 0.74. Cryogenic measurements on SQUID show that the sample with y = 0 displays two different temperature regions at 2-50 K and 100-300 K. The first one exhibits nearly pure paramagnetic behaviour with circle dot = -0.7, while the second one shows a highly negative Weiss constant of circle dot = -80.6.

AB Chalcogenide glasses have attained enormous research interest due to their importance in finding electronic memories. Here we report electrical switching and thermal crystallization behavior of Si20Te80 (-) (x)Bix (0 <= x <= 3) glasses. We observe a significant decrease in the threshold voltage (V-T) and the thermal stability (Delta T), indicating that in Si20Te80 (-) Bi-X(X) glasses, the resistivity of the additive element Bi plays a dominant role over network connectivity/rigidity. The variation of V-T with respect to thickness and temperature of the sample indicates that the memory switching observed in Si20Te80 -XBiX glasses is influenced by the thermally induced transitions (thermal mechanism). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) studies on pre-switched and post switched samples reveal the morphological changes on the surface of the sample, and serve as an experimental evidence for the formation of the crystalline filament between two electrodes during switching. Furthermore, the decrease in Delta T values indicates that the Si-Te glasses become de-vitrifiable more easily with the addition of Bi, influencing the decrease of V-T. Structural evaluation like thermal devitrification studies and morphological changes elucidate the restricted glass formability of the studied glass system.

AB Molecular mobility of nanocomposites based on poly(phenylene oxide) (PPO) containing 1, 2, 4 and 8 wt% of C-60 fullerenes was studied by dielectric spectroscopy. In all samples, two relaxation processes were present and caused by polarization of the single polar -O- group located between phenyl rings. This polarization includes two stages With the first stage (occurring in the glassy state) is caused by rotation of phenyl rings and the adjacent polar -O- groups by small angles that results in the local beta process. The second stage (occurring at temperatures exceeding the glass transition temperature T-g) involves segmental mobility and leads to emergence of the a process. Molecular mobility in the region of the beta process varies slightly with C-60 concentration. In the case of the a process, molecular mobility changes non-monotonically with increasing fullerene concentration.

AB The suitability of glass polyalkenoate cements (GPCs) as injectable adhesives in orthopedics has been compromised by the presence of aluminum (Al), a component in the glass phase of all commercial GPCs. There has been considerable work on the development of Al-free GPCs which can be formulated based on calcium (Ca) zinc (Zn) silicate (Si) glasses. These materials, in terms of biocompatibility and mechanical properties, have potential for orthopedics. However, many of these experimental Al-free GPCs have setting times shorter than 60 s, restricting clinical applications. Here, the authors incorporate Magnesium (Mg) into the glass phase of Al-free GPCs in an attempt to extend their handling properties without deleteriously influencing strength. Three Mg-Ca-Zn-Si glasses with increasing amounts of Mg (up to 12 mol%) substituting for Ca were synthesized and GPCs were subsequently produced by mixing each glass with aqueous polyacrylic acid (PAA). The results show that Mg substituted for Ca in the glasses did significantly affect the chemical structure of the glasses by increasing the bridging oxygen to non-bridging oxygen (BO:NBO) ratio. The resultant GPCs exhibited extended working times, in line with Mg content in the glass, combined with significant increases in both compressive and biaxial flexural strength with both cement maturation and molecular weight of the PAA phase. Mg-based GPCs recorded working times of up to 145 s, setting times of up to 191 s, and compressive strengths in excess of 58 MPa after 30 days maturation. Thus, we have shown that Mg incorporation into Al-free ionomer glasses can result in GPCs formulated from them that have handling and mechanical properties suitable for orthopedic applications.

AB The anatomy of an ancient accretionary complex has a significance for a better understanding of the tectonic processes of accretionary orogens and complex because of its complicated compositions and strong deformation. With a thorough structural and geochronological study of a fossil accretionary complex in the Atbashi Ridge, South Tianshan (Kyrgyzstan), we analyze the structure and architecture of ocean plate stratigraphy in the western Central Asian Orogenic Belt. The architecture of the Atbashi accretionary complex is subdivisible into four lithotectonic assemblages, some of which are melanges with "block-in-matrix" structure: (1) North Ophiolitic Melange; (2) High-pressure (HP)/Ultra-high-pressure (UHP) Metamorphic Assemblage; (3) Coherent & Melange Assemblage; and (4) South Ophiolitic Melange. Relationships between main units are tectonic contacts presented by faults. The major structures and lithostratigraphy of these units are thrust-fold nappes, thrusted duplexes, and imbricated ocean plate stratigraphy. All these rock units are complicatedly stacked in 3-D with the HP/UHP rocks being obliquely southwestward extruded. Detrital zircon ages of meta-sediments provide robust constraints on their provenance from the Hi-Central Tianshan Arc. The isotopic ages of the youngest components of the four units are Late Permian, Early-Middle Triassic, Early Carboniferous, and Early Triassic, respectively. We present a new tectonic model of the South Tianshan; a general northward subduction polarity led to final closure of the South Tianshan Ocean in the End-Permian to Late Triassic. These results help to resolve the long-standing controversy regarding the subduction polarity and the timing of the final closure of the South Tianshan Ocean. Finally, our work sheds lights on the use of ocean plate stratigraphy in the analysis of the tectonic evolution of accretionary orogens.

AB The Central Asian Orogenic Belt (CAOB) is one of the largest accretionary orogens on Earth and is characterized by the occurrence of tight oroclines (Kazakhstan and Tuva-Mongolian oroclines). The origin of these large-scale orogenic curvatures is not quite understood, but is fundamentally important for understanding crustal growth and tectonic evolution of the CAOB. Here we provide an outline of available geological and paleomagnetic data around the Kazakhstan Orocline, with an aim of clarifying the geometry, kinematics and geodynamic origin of the orocline. The Kazakhstan Orocline is evident in a total magmatic image, and can be traced by the continuation of high magnetic anomalies associated with the Devonian Volcanic Belt and the Late Devonian to Carboniferous Balkhash-Yili arc. Paleomagnetic data show similar to 112-126 degrees clockwise rotation of the northern limb relative to the southern limb in the Late Devonian to Early Carboniferous, as well as similar to 15-28 degrees clockwise rotation of the northern limb and similar to 39-40 degrees anticlockwise rotation of the southern limb relative to the hinge of the orocline during the Late Carboniferous to Permian. We argue that the Kazakhstan Orocline experienced two stage bending with the early stage of bending (Late Devonian to Early Carboniferous; similar to 112-126 degrees) driven by slab rollback, and the later stage (Late Carboniferous to Permian; 54-68 degrees) possibly associated with the amalgamation of the Siberian, Tarim and Baltic cratons. This new tectonic model is compatible with the occurrence of rift basins, the spatial migration of magmatic arc, and the development of large-scale strike-slip fault systems during oroclinal bending.

AB The Beishan orogenic belt is a key region for deciphering the accretionary processes of the southern Central Asian Orogenic Belt. Here in this paper we present new zircon U-Pb ages, bulk-rock major and trace element, and zircon Hf isotopic data for the Baitoushan, and Bagelengtai plutons in the western Central Beishan region to address the accretionary processes. The Baitoushan pluton consists of quartz diorites, monzonites and K-feldspar granites, with zircon LA-ICP-MS U-Pb ages of 435 Ma, 421 Ma and 401 Ma, respectively.
   The Baitoushan quartz diorites and quartz monzonites exhibit relatively high MgO contents and Mg# values (63-72), display enrichments in LILEs and LREEs, and exhibit high Ba (585-1415 ppm), Sr (416-570 ppm) and compatible element (such as Cr and Ni) abundances, which make them akin to typical high-Mg andesites. The Baitoushan quartz diorites and quartz monzonites were probably generated by the interaction of subducted oceanic sediment-derived melts and mantle peridotites. The Baitoushan K-feldspar granites are ascribed to fractionated I-type granites with peraluminous and high-K calc-alkaline characteristics. They exhibit positive epsilon(Hf)(t) values (2.43-7.63) and Mesoproterozoic-Neoproterozoic zircon Hf model ages (0.92-1.60 Ga). Those early Devonian granites, including Baitoushan K-feldspar granite and Gongpoquan leucogranites (402 Ma), are derived from melting of the mafic lower crust and/or sediments by upwelling of hot asthenospheric mantle. The Bagelengtai granodiorites exhibit similar geochemical signatures with that of typical adakites, with a zircon SHRIMP U-Pb age of 435 Ma. They exhibit relatively high Sr (502628 ppm) and Al2O3 (16.40-17.40 wt.%) contents, and low MgO (1.02-1.29 wt.%), Y (3.37-6.94 ppm) and HREEs contents, with relatively high Sr/Y and (La/Yb)(N) ratios. The Bagelengtai granodiorites were derived from partial melting of subducted young oceanic crust, with significant contributions of subducted sediments, subsequently hybridized by the mantle peridotite.
   On the basis of our data and combined with previous data, we conclude that a Silurian-early Devonian slab window model accounts for all geological records in the western segment of the Central Beishan. We further propose that magmatic events associated with a slab window played an important role in crustal growth of the Central Asian Orogenic Belt. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Late Carboniferous to Early Permian is a critical period for the final amalgamation of the Central Asian Orogenic Belt (CAOB). However, as most of the accreted terranes of the CAOB are unclear in tectonic nature and origin, the timing and processes of their mutual amalgamation have been poorly constrained. To understand assembly of the West Junggar Terrane with the Yili Block, a suite of the late Paleozoic magmatic rocks, including ignimbrite, rhyolite and granite, in northwestern Chinese Tianshan Belt were studied for their petrogenesis and tectonic implications. Our new results of secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) zircon U-Pb dating reveal two separate magmatic episodes, ca. 300 Ma volcanism (ignimbrite and rhyolite) and ca. 288 Ma plutonsim (biotite granite). Geochemically, for the ca. 300 Ma volcanism, the ignimbrites have low SiO2 (65.8-71.5 wt.%) and Mg-# (6-13) values, and exhibit arc affinity with significantly enriched in large ion lithophile elements (LILE) and depleted in high field strength elements (HFSE) such as Nb, Ta and Ti. The whole-rock epsilon(Nd)(t) and zircon epsilon(Nf)(t) values range from +6.9 to +7.0 and +9.9 to +14.1 respectively, indicating a juvenile basaltic lower crustal origin. Rhyolites have slightly high SiO2 (72.7-74.0 wt.%) and K2O (3.86-4.53 wt.%) contents, high zircon 6180 (11.67-13.2 parts per thousand) values, and low whole-rock epsilon(Nd)(t) (+2.9 to +3.8) and zircon epsilon(Nf)(t) (+2.8 to +10.0) values, which may suggest sediment involvements during magma generation. In contrast, for the ca. 288 Ma plutonism, the biotite granites have obviously higher SiO2 (74.7-75.5 wt.%) contents and whole-rock epsilon(Nd)(t) (+7.7 to +8.8), zircon ENO) (+9.8 to +12.7), and lower zircon delta O-18 (5.99-6.84%,,) values, than those of the ca. 300 Ma volcanic rocks, which are consistent with signatures of juvenile magma source. According to our estimates of zircon saturation temperatures, together with their contrasting genesis, we attribute the formation of ca. 300 Ma high temperature (815-938 degrees C) volcanism to oceanic slab break-off during assembly of the West Junggar Terrane with the Yili Block, and relate the generation of ca. 288 Ma low temperature (723-735 degrees C) plutonism to subsequent strike-slipping of North Tianshan Fault that facilitated introduction of water-fluxes triggering hydrous partial melting of juvenile lower crust. The sequential magmatic episodes in the northwestern Chinese Tianshan Belt may provide a crucial clue to a tectonic transition from plate convergence to intra-plate adjustment during the formation of the Kazakhstan Orocline in the late Paleozoic.

AB The Aqishan-Yamansu belt in the Eastern Tianshan (Xinjiang, NW China) is an important mineralization belt. The belt mainly comprises Carboniferous volcanic, volcaniclastic and elastic rocks, and hosts many intermediate-felsic intrusions and Fe (-Cu) deposits. The biotite diorite, felsic brecciated tuff, granodiorite and syenite from the western Aqishan-Yamansu belt are newly zircon U-Pb dated to be 316.7 +/- 1.4 Ma, 315.6 +/- 2.6 Ma, 305.8 +/- 1.9 Ma and 252.5 +/- 1.4 Ma, respectively. The mafic rocks (mafic brecciated tuff and diabase porphyry) are tholeiitic to talc-alkaline series, LILE-rich (e.g., Rb, Ba and Pb), HFSE-depleted (e.g., Nb and Ta), and have high Mg-#(44-60), Nb/Ta (15.0-20.0), Ba/La (> 30) and Ba/Nb (> 57) values/ratios, and low Th/Yb ratios (< 1), probably originating from mantle wedge metasomatized by slab-derived fluids. The intermediate-felsic igneous rocks are LILE-rich, HFSE-depleted, with high Sr and Y contents showing typical of normal arc magma affinity. Moreover, the depleted epsilon(Hf)(t) (> 2.10) and positive epsilon(Nd)(t) (> 5.7), combined with variable Nb/Ta ratios (9.52-21.4), Y/Nb ratios (1.47-39.7) and Pb isotopes (Pb-206/Pb-204 = 16.225-17.640, Pb-207/Pb-204 = 15.454-15.520, Pb-208/Pb-204 = 37.097-38.025) suggest that these rocks were magma mixing products between juvenile crustal-derived magmas and minor mantle-derived magmas. Combined published works with our new ages, geochemical and isotopic data, we propose that the Aqishan-Yamansu belt was an Early Carboniferous fore-arc basin during the southward subduction of the Kangguer oceanic slab beneath the Yili-Central Tianshan block. With the continuing southward subduction, the Aqishan-Yamansu fore-arc basin initiated to close, which generated the mafic and intensive intermediate-felsic magmatism associated with regional Fe (-Cu) mineralization.

AB We present zircon ages and geochemical data for Cambrian ophiolite complexes exposed in the Beishan area at the southern margin of the Central Asian Orogenic Belt (CAOB). The complexes consist of the XichangjingXiaohuangshan and Hongliuhe-Yushishan ophiolites, which both exhibit complete ophiolite stratigraphy: chert, basalt, sheeted dikes, gabbro, mafic and ultramafic cumulates and serpentinized mantle peridotites. Zircon grains of gabbro samples yielded Pb-206/U-238 ages of 516 +/- 8, 521 +/- 4, 528 +/- 3 and 535 +/- 6 Ma that reflect the timing of gabbro emplacement.
   The geochemical data of the basaltic rocks show enrichment in large-ion lithophile elements and depletion in the high field strength elements relative to normal mid-oceanic ridge basalt (NMORB) in response to aqueous fluids or melts expelled from the subducting slab. The gabbro samples have higher whole-rock initial Sr-87/Sr-86 ratios and lower positive epsilon(Nd(t)) values than NMORB. These geochemical signatures resulted from processes or conditions that are unique to subduction zones, and the ophiolites are therefore likely to have formed within a supra-subduction zone (SSZ) environment. We suggest that the Cambrian ophiolite complexes in the Beishan area formed within a SSZ setting, reflecting an early Paleozoic subduction of components of the Paleo-Central Asian Ocean and recording an early Paleozoic southward subduction event in the southern CAOB along the northern margin of the Tarim and North China Cratons.

   OPHIOLITIC MELANGES
AB The Carboniferous Bayingou ophiolitic melange is exposed in the North Tianshan accretionary complex in the southwestern part of the Central Asian Orogenic Belt (CAOB). The m lange is mainly composed of serpentinised ultramafic rocks (including harzburgite, lherzolite, pyroxenite, dunite and peridotite), pillowed and massive basalts, layered gabbros, radiolarian cherts, pelagic limestones, breccias and tuffs, and displays block-in-matrix structures. The blocks of ultramafic rocks, gabbros, basalts, cherts, and limestones are set in a matrix of serpentinised ultramafic rocks, massive basalts and tuffs. The basaltic rocks in the m lange show significant geochemical heterogeneity, and two compositional groups, one ocean island basalt-like, and the other mid-ocean ridge-like, can be distinguished on the basis of their isotopic compositions and immobile trace element contents (such as light rare earth element enrichment in the former, but depletion in the latter). The more-enriched basaltic rocks are interpreted as remnants/fragments of seamounts, derived from a deep mantle reservoir with low degrees (2-3%) of garnet lherzolite mantle melting. The depleted basalts most likely formed by melting of a shallower spinel lherzolite mantle source with-15% partial melting. It is probable that both groups owe their origin to melting of a mixture between plume and depleted MORB mantle. The results from this study, when integrated with previous work, indicate that the Junggar Ocean crust (comprising a significant number of seamounts) was likely to have been subducted southward beneath the Yili-Central Tianshan block in the Late Devonian-Early Carboniferous. The seamounts were scraped-off and accreted along with the oceanic crust in an accretionary wedge to form the Bayingou ophiolitic m lange. We present a model for the tectonomagmatic evolution of this portion of the CAOB involving prolonged intra-oceanic subduction with seamount accretion.

AB The Late Paleozoic magmatic evolution of the Bogda Range (Chinese North Tianshan) is important for understanding the accretionary history of the Central Asian Orogenic Belt. We investigated the Carboniferous and Lower Permian volcanic and sedimentary sequences of the Daheyan section, southern Bogda Range, and present new zircon U-Pb ages and whole-rock geochemical data for the volcanic rocks. One Carboniferous rhyolite is dated at 298 +/- 8 Ma; a Permian basalt yielded many Proterozoic zircon xenocrysts, and its maximum age (similar to 297 Ma) is constrained by the detrital zircon ages of the sandstone that stratigraphically underlies it. These volcanic rocks belong to talc-alkaline series. We further synthesize previous geochronological, geochemical and isotopic data of magmatic and sedimentary rocks in the Bogda Range. The available data indicate that the magmatism occurred continuously from 350 Ma to 280 Ma. A comprehensive analysis allows us to propose that: (1) the Carboniferous to Early Permian magmatic rocks of the Bogda Range generally show consistent arc-type features; (2) increasing mantle input through time suggests intra-arc extension in a supra-subduction zone; (3) the localized occurrence of Early Permian alkaline pillow basalts and deep water sediments close to the major shear zone advocate a transtensional crustal thinning during the transition from Carboniferous convergence to Early Permian transcurrent tectonics; (4) occurrence of a large number of Proterozoic zircon xenocrysts in the Late Paleozoic magmatic rocks, and Proterozoic detrital zircons in the coeval elastic sediments suggest a continental or transitional basement of the Bogda Arc; (5) subduction in the Bogda area terminated prior to the deposition of Middle Permian terrestrial sediments.

AB Postorogenic intrusions of essexites and alkaline and nepheline syenites in the Turkestan-Alai segment of the Kyrgyz Southern Tien Shan coexist with dikes and veins of carbonatites dated at similar to 220 Ma by the Ar-Ar and Rb-Sr age methods. They are mainly composed of calcite and dolomite (60-85%), as well as sodic amphibole, phlogopite, clinopyroxene, microcline, albite, apatite, and magnetite, with accessory niobate, ilmenite, Nb-rutile, titanite, zircon, baddeleyite, monazite-(Ce), barite, and sulfides. The rocks share mineralogical and geochemical similarity with carbonatites that originated by liquid immiscibility at high temperatures above 500 degrees C. Alkaline silicate and salt-carbonate melts are derived from sources with mainly negative bulk epsilon Nd(t) similar to from -11 to 0 and high initial Sr-87/Sr-86 ratios (similar to 0.7061-0.7095) which may be due to mixing of PREMA and EM-type mantle material. Pb isotopic ratios in accessory pyrrhotite (Pb-206/Pb-204 = 18.38; Pb-207/Pb-204 = 15.64; (208)pb/(204),. = 38.41) exhibit an EM2 trend. The intrusions bear signatures of significant crustal contamination as a result of magma genesis by syntexis and hybridism. Concordant isotope composition changes of delta C-13 (-6.5 to -1.9%o), delta O-18 (9.2-23 parts per thousand), delta D (- 58 to - 41 parts per thousand), and delta S-34 (12.6-12.8%o) in minerals and rocks indicate inputs of crustal material at the stage of melting and effect of hot fluids released during dehydration of metamorphosed oceanic basalts or sediments. The observed HFSE patterns of the oldest alkaline gabbro may be due to interaction of the primary mafic magma with IAB-type material. The isotope similarity of alkaline rocks with spatially proximal basalts of the Tarim large igneous province does not contradict the evolution of the Turkestan-Alai Triassic magmatism as the "last echo" of the Tarim mantle plume.

   IMPLICATIONS
AB Subduction zones are important for understanding of the global carbon cycle from the surface to deep part of the mantle. The processes involved the metamorphism of carbonate-bearing rocks largely control the fate of carbon and contribute to local carbon isotopic heterogeneities of the mantle. In this study, we present petrological and geochemical results for marbles and carbonated eclogites in the Southwestern Tianshan UHP belt, NW China. Marbles are interlayered with coesite-bearing pelitic schists, and have Sr-Nd isotopic values (epsilon Nd ((T = 320Ma)) = -3.7 to -8.9, Sr-87/Sr-86 ((i)) = 0.7084-0.7089), typical of marine carbonates. The marbles have dispersed low delta O-18(VSMOW) values (ranging from 14 to 29 parts per thousand) and unaffected carbon isotope (delta C-13(VPDB) = -0.2-3.6 parts per thousand), possibly due to infiltration of external H2O-rich fluids. Recycling of these marbles into mantle may play a key role in the carbon budget and contributed to the mantle carbon isotope heterogeneity.
   The carbonated eclogites have high Sr isotopic compositions (Sr-87/Sr-86 ((i)) = 0.7077-0.7082) and positive epsilon Nd ((T = 320 Ma)) values (from 7.6 to 8.2), indicative of strong seafloor alteration of their protolith. The carbonates in the carbonated eclogites are mainly dolomite (Fe-# = 12-43, Fe-# = Fe2+/(Fe2+ + Mg)) that were added into oceanic basalts during seafloor alteration and experienced calcite - dolomite - magnesite transformation during the subduction metamorphic process. The uniformly low delta O-18 values (similar to 11.44%) of carbonates in the carbontaed eclogites can be explained by closed-system equilibrium between carbonate and silicate minerals. The low delta C-13 values (from -3.3 to -7.7%) of the carbonated eclogites most likely reflect contribution from organic carbon. Recycling of these carbonated eclogites with C isotope similar to typical mantle reservoirs into mantle may have little effect on the mantle carbon isotope heterogeneity.

AB The Anrakhai Metamorphic Complex (AMC), located in the SE part of the Chu-Ili Mountains of Southern Kazakhstan in the western part of Central Asian Orogenic Belt, exhibits occurrences of HP metamorphic rocks in the form of eclogites and garnet clinopyroxenites with peak metamorphic conditions of 750-850 and 15-19 kbar estimated with both conventional geothermobarometric methods and phase diagram modeling. PT estimates as well as intimate field relations evidently imply a common metamorphic history for eclogites and garnet clinopyroxenites of the AMC. These high-pressure, medium temperature eclogite fades P-T conditions are indicative of a collision or subduction tectonic setting. Major and trace element geochemistry suggests that they probably had a common magmatic origin as part of a suite of differentiated tholeiitic intrusions. Furthermore, distinctive mineral and chemical compositions of these eclogites and garnet clinopyroxenites correspond to the Fe-Ti type of ultramafic rocks suggesting that they may have been derivatives of intraplate tholeiitic melts, introduced into continental crust before HP metamorphism.

AB Co-existing granulite and peridotite may represent relics of the paleo-suture zone and provides an optimal opportunity for better understanding of orogeny between two blocks. In this study, we carried out petrological and U-Pb zircon dating investigation on the HP mafic granulites associated with peridotite complex at Yushugou in Chinese South Tianshan. The studied samples include garnet-bearing high-pressure mafic granulites which can be subdivided into two types: Type I orthopyroxene-free and Type II orthopyroxene-bearing granulites and amphibolite. Type I granulite (Y21-2) has a mineral assemblage of garnet (33 vol.%), clinopyroxene (32 vol.%) and plagioclase (30 vol.%); and Type II granulite (Y18-8) has a mineral assemblage of garnet (22 vol.%), dinopyroxene (10 vol.%), orthopyroxene (14 vol.%), plagioclase (45 vol.%) and quartz. Garnet in both granulites exhibits core-rim structure characterized by increasing grossular and decreasing pyrope from core to rim. Petrographic observations and phase equilibrium modeling using THERMOCALC in the NCFMASHTO system for the mafic granulites (Y21-2 and Y18-8) show three stages of metamorphism: Stage I (granulite facies) was recognized by the large porphyroblastic garnet core, with P-T conditions of 9.8-10.4 Kbar and 860-900 degrees C (Y212) and 9.9-10.6 Kbar and 875-890 degrees C (Y18-8), respectively; Stage II (HP granulite facies) has peak P-T conditions of 12.1 Kbar at 755 degrees C (Y21-2) and 13.8 Kbar at 815 degrees C (Y18-8) using mineral assemblages combining with garnet rim compositions with maximum grossular and minimum pyrope contents; Stage III (amphibolite facies) was characterized by the development of calcic amphibole in granulites with temperature of 446-563 degrees C. Therefore, an anticlockwise P-T path characterized by simultaneous temperature-decreasing and pressure-increasing was inferred for the Yushugou HP mafic granulite. Studies of zircon morphology and inclusions, combined with zircon U-Pb dating and REE geochemistry indicate that their protolith's ages of the mafic granulites were similar to 430 Ma, while the metamorphism could occur at three stages with ages of similar to 390 Ma, similar to 340 Ma and similar to 320 Ma, which may correspond to Stage I, II and III, respectively. We interpret the HP mafic granulites from the Yushugou granulite-peridotite complex to be formed by the cooling subduction of the lower crustal rocks from the hanging wall of central Tianshan block during the northward subduction of the south Tianshan paleo-ocean from Devonian to Carboniferous.

AB The geodynamic control of mineralization in the accretionary evolution of the Central Asian Orogenic Belt (CAOB) has long been controversial. Here we report new field, geochemical and geochronological data on recently defined porphyry and skarn-type ore deposits (Devonian-Early Carboniferous) in the Kalatage area in the middle of the Harlik-Dananhu arc, Eastern Tianshan, NW China in the southern CAOB, with the aim of better understanding the accretionary tectonics and genesis of porphyry and skam-type mineralization. The Yudai porphyry Cu-(Au) deposits and the Xierqu skarn Cu-Fe-(Au) deposits are closely associated with Middle Devonian adakitic diorite porphyries (382-390 Ma), which are talc-alkaline and characterized by high Na2O/K2O ratios and Sr contents (310-1020 ppm), strong depletion of HREE (e.g., Yb = 0.80-1.44 ppm) and Y (7.68-14.50 ppm), and all enriched in Rb, Sr, Ba, K and depleted in Nb and Ti. They are characterized by distinctive Eu positive anomalies, high Na2O contents and MORE-like Sr and Nd isotope signatures (high epsilon(Nd)(t) = +6.1 to +7.0 and low (Sr-87/Sr-86)(i) = 0.70412-0.70462). These adakites most likely formed by melting of a young/hot subducted oceanic slab, and adakites in general are important carriers of porphyry Cu +/- (Au) deposits. Early Carboniferous adakites in the Tuwu area south of Kalatage are known to have similar features. Therefore, skarn-mineralized porphyry adakites get younger from north to south, suggesting southward migration of the Harlik-Dananhu arc from 390 Ma to 322 Ma. These data indicate that partial melting of hot (and/or young) oceanic crustal slabs were an important mechanism of accretionary crustal growth and mineralization in the southern CAOB.

AB The Sanfengshan copper deposit, located in the Beishan orogenic belt, Northwestern China, is hosted in the lower member of the Hongliuyuan Formation, an early Carboniferous metavolcanic-sedimentary sequence. Mineralization occurs as stratiform, stratiform-like and lenticular orebodies, and comprises of laminated, brecciated, banded, massive, and disseminated ores. The mineralogy is dominated by pyrite, chalcopyrite and sphalerite. Fe-Mn chert is widely distributed and generally occurs as massive, laminated, bands or lenses, which are consistent with the orebody. Alteration at Sanfengshan displays a clear concentric zoning pattern and the footwall alteration is more intense and somewhat thicker than the hanging-wall alteration. Systematic geochemical investigation on the volcanic rocks in this area shows that the basalts of the Hongliuyuan Formation (HLY) are predominantly tholeiites with nearly flat rare earth element (REE) pattern, insignificant negative anomalies of high field strength elements (HFSEs), and low Ti/V and Th/Nb ratios. They were most likely derived from partial melting of depleted asthenospheric mantle and formed in a fore-arc setting during initiation of the southward subduction of the Paleo-Asian Ocean. The basalts of the Maotoushan Formation (MTS) display a calc-alkaline nature and are enriched in large ion lithophile elements (LILEs) and depleted in HFSEs, suggesting an active continental margin setting. Sulfur isotope (delta S-34) values of the sulfide and sulfate minerals vary between 0 parts per thousand and 5.4 parts per thousand, which are consistent with sulfur derivation from leaching of the host volcanic rocks, although a direct magmatic contribution cannot be ruled out. The Re-Os isotope data of pyrite yield an isochron age of 353 +/- 35 Ma, consistent with the age of the host HLY basalts. Thus, a syngenetic (volcanogenic massive sulfide) model is proposed and it is concluded that the Sanfengshan copper deposit is a typical Cyprus-type VMS deposit that formed in an early Carboniferous fore-arc setting in the Beishan orogenic belt.

AB The Western Tianshan in NW China is one of the most important gold provinces in the Central Asian Orogenic Belt (CAOB). The recently discovered Kuruer Cu-Au deposit has been interpreted to represent a transition from high-sulfidation epithermal to porphyry mineralization system. In this study, we present new LA-ICP-MS zircon U-Pb ages for the many magmatic rock types at Kuruer, including the Dahalajunshan Formation andesitic tuff (333.2 +/- 1.6 Ma), diorite porphyry (269.7 +/- 2.0 Ma), slightly-altered (264.4 +/- 2.6 Ma) and intensively-altered (270.5 +/- 2.5 Ma) albite porphyry. These ages reveal two distinct magmatic episodes: The Early Carboniferous Dahalajunshan Formation (wall rocks) andesitic tuff samples contain narrow ranges of SiO2 (60.29-61.28 wt.%), TiO2 (0.96-0.98 wt.%), Al2O3 (16.55-16.57 wt.%) and Fe2O3T. (5.36-5.57 wt.%). The tuff is characterized by LREE enrichment and HFSE depletion, as well as LREE/HREE enrichment ((La/Yb)(N) = 8.31-8.76) and negative Eu anomalies (delta Eu = 0.64-0.76). Zircon epsilon(Hf) (t) values are 5.4-8.2, and two stage Hf model ages (T-DM2) are 821-1016 Ma, indicating partial melting of a moderately depleted mantle wedge with Precambrian continental crustal input. The ore-forming Middle Permian diorite porphyry and (quartz) albite porphyry have variable major oxide compositions (e.g., SiO2 = 53.09-53.12 wt.% for the diorite porphyry, 70.84-78.03 wt.% for the albite porphyry, and 74.07-75.03 wt.% for the quartz albite porphyry) but similar chondrite-normalized REE and primitive mantle-normalized multi-element patterns. These porphyries display LREE enrichment and HFSE depletion, as well as elevated LREE/HREE enrichment and negative Eu anomalies. The positive zircon epsilon(Hf)(t) values (11.7-15.9 for the diorite porphyry, 8.9-14.9 for the albite porphyry) and young two-stage Hf model ages (T-DM2) (282-542 Ma for the diorite porphyry, 337-717 Ma for the albite porphyry) indicate a major juvenile continental crustal involvement. We propose that the Carboniferous and Middle Permian magmatism was formed in a continental arc and post-collisional settings, respectively, with the latter episode responsible for the Cu-Au mineralization.

AB The Axi and Jingxi-Yelmand gold deposits, being the largest gold deposits in the Chinese North Tianshan, NW China, are located ca. 10 km apart in the Tulasu Basin, and are hosted by the Late Devonian - Early Carboniferous Dahalajunshan Formation. In situ LA-ICP-MS titanium analyses on quartz from the Axi and Jingxi-Yelmand deposits are broadly identical. Accordingly, the calculated ore-forming temperatures by Ti-in-quartz thermometer give average temperatures of 279 degrees C and 294 degrees C, respectively. Results of in situ SIMS analyses of oxygen and sulfur isotopes on quartz and pyrite from these two deposits are similar. Temperature-corrected fluids of the Axi deposit have 8180 values of 2.6-8.1 parts per thousand and delta S-34 values of 0.8-2.4 parts per thousand, whereas the fluids of the Jingxi-Yelmand deposit have delta O-18 of 6.4-8.9 parts per thousand and delta S-34 of -0.4 to 4.0 parts per thousand. The oxygen and sulfur isotopes from the two deposits indicate a magmatic origin. LA-ICP-MS zircon U-Pb ages of Aqialehe Formation sandstone provided a lower limit for the mineralization timing of the Axi deposit (288 Ma). In situ SIMS U-Pb analyses on entrapped zircon (297 Ma) and newly recognized 284.5 Ma columnar rhyolite implies that the Jingxi-Yelmand deposit formed in the Early Permian. Based on the magmatic affinity of the ore fluids, similar age and ore-formation temperatures, we propose that the Axi and Jingxi-Yelmand deposits comprise an epithermal gold system, which was driven by the same Permian magma in the Tulasu Basin. The ore geological features together with our new results indicate that the Axi and Jingxi-Yelmand deposits are intermediate and high sulfidation type epithermal deposits, respectively.

AB The Kashkasu deposit is part of the subduction-related Late Paleozoic (Late Carboniferous) metallogenic belt of Tien Shan. It is associated with a multiphase monzodiorite-monzonite-granodiorite-granite pluton of the magnetite-series high-K calc-alkaline to shoshonitic igneous suite. The deposit contains zones of W-Mo-Cu oxidized prograde and retrograde skarns, with abundant andraditic garnet, magnetite, locally scapolite and K-feldspar, as well as scheelite, chalcopyrite, and molybdenite. Skams are overprinted by quartz-carbonate-sericite (phyllic alteration) zones with scheelite and sulfides.
   Prograde calcic skarn and initial retrograde skams were formed from a high temperature (650 degrees C to 450-550 degrees C), high pressure (2000 bars to 600-900 bars) magmatic-hydrothermal low- to high-salinity aqueous chloride fluid. The gradual fluid evolution was interrupted by the intrusion of granodiorite and likely associated release of low-salinity (similar to 7-8 wt% NaCl equiv.) fluid. Ascent of this fluid to shallower levels and/or its cooling to 400-500 degrees C has resulted in phase separation into low-salinity (2.1-3.1 wt% NaCl equiv.) vapor and coexisting brine (35-40 wt% NaCl equiv.). The boiling was coincident with most intense scheelite deposition in retrograde skarn. Later retrograde skarn assemblages were formed from a gaseous, low- to moderate-salinity (3.4-8.1 wt% NaCl equiv.) fluid and then from high salinity (37-42 wt% NaCl equiv.) aqueous chloride fluids, the latter being enriched in Ca (17-20 wt% CaCl2) that could also affect scheelite deposition. Another cycle of fluid exsolution from crystallizing magma corresponded to quartz-carbonate-sericite-scheelite-sulfide (phyllic) alteration stage, with the early low-salinity (5.3-8.4 wt% NaCl-equiv.) fluid followed by later high-salinity (33.5-38.2 wt% NaCl-equiv.) fluid. The sulfur isotope data (delta S-34 = +5.1 to +9.0) suggest significant sulfur sourcing from sedimentary rocks enriched in seawater sulfate, possibly evaporites,

AB Although human exposure to water aerosols is common in residential showers, the droplet distribution patterns generated in showers are not well understood nor is the bacteria released during shower operation. In this study, a two-phase flow Particle Tracking Velocimetry (PTV) algorithm was successfully used to characterize the spatial spray pattern and velocity field in two experimental showers (one low flow and one high-flow). In addition, the airborne bacteria present in the shower over nearly 5 months of controlled operation was determined for both showers. The results indicate that the droplet velocity out of the low-flow showerhead (which had fewer orifices) was significantly higher than that out of the high flow showerhead resulting in a higher aerosol number concentration in the low-flow shower and more consistent wetting of the shower wall. Both showerheads generated droplets in the respirable range and genera of potential health concern were observed in the shower aerosols measured both prior to and following shower operation. The study provides one of the first visualizations of droplet spray patterns in residential showers and provides insight into the airborne bacteria present in showers. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The removal of bromate (BrO3-) as a by-product of ozonation in subsequent managed aquifer recharge (MAR) systems, specifically in anoxic nitrate (NO3-)-reducing zones, has so far gained little attention. In this study, batch reactors and columns were used to explore the influence of NO3- and increased assimilable organic carbon (AOC) due to ozonation pre-treatment on BrO3- removal in MAR systems. 8 m column experiments were carried out for 10 months to investigate BrO3- behavior in anoxic NO3- reducing zones of MAR systems. Anoxic batch experiments showed that an increase of AOC promoted microbial activity and corresponding BrO3- removal. A drastic increase of BrO3- biodegradation was observed in the sudden absence of NO3- in both batch reactors and columns, indicating that BrO3- and NO3- competed for biodegradation by denitrifying bacteria and NO3- was preferred as an electron acceptor under the simultaneous presence of NO3- and BrO3-. However, within 75 days' absence of NO3- in the anoxic column, BrO3- removal gradually decreased, indicating that the presence of NO3- is a precondition for denitrifying bacteria to reduce BrO3- in NO3--reducing anoxic zones. In the 8 m anoxic column set-up (retention time 6 days), the BrO3- removal achieved levels as low as 1.3 mu g/L, starting at 60 mu g/L. (98% removal). Taken together, BrO3- removal is likely to occur in vicinity of NO3--reducing anoxic zones, so MAR systems following ozonation are potentially effective to remove BrO3-.

AB Strategies to control biofouling without using antimicrobial chemicals are needed to prevent the spread of antibiotic resistance genes and disruption of microbial activities in biological treatment. This study developed an environmentally friendly biofouling resistant membrane by incorporating (D)-tyrosine onto a commercial nanofiltration membrane using FAU type zeolite nanoparticles that covalently bound to the membrane surface as carriers for slow release. The D-tyrosine loaded membrane had similar water permeability as the unmodified membrane, but greatly reduced initial cell attachment and strongly inhibited subsequent biofilm formation without inactivating the bacteria. The membrane slowly released (D)-tyrosine in the time course of over 5 days, and retained its anti-biofouling capability in repeated 24 h efficacy tests for as long as 6 days. In nanofiltration operation, the (D)-tyrosine incorporated zeolite coating completely inhibited cell adhesion on the membrane surface and significantly alleviated membrane flux decline.

AB Sulfur reduction is a promising alternative to sulfate reduction as it can generate sulfide at a low cost for the precipitation of heavy metals or autotrophic denitrification in wastewater treatment. However, the extremely low water solubility of elemental sulfur limits its bioavailability and results in a low sulfur reduction rate. Polysulfide, which is naturally generated through reactions between sulfur and sulfide, can enhance the bioavailability of sulfur and thus contribute to high-rate sulfur reduction. Based on this principle, a laboratory-scale sulfur-reducing bioreactor was designed in this study for wastewater treatment. After 164 days of operation, the sulfide production rate (SPR) in the bioreactor reached 126 mg SQL-h, which is significantly higher than those of other sulfate-reducing systems. Moreover, dissolved zero-valent sulfur (referred to as polysulfide) was detected in the sulfur-reducing reactor when the organics were completely depleted, indicating that polysulfide can form naturally and be readily reduced to sulfide in the bioreactor. We found that the produced sulfide promoted the formation of more polysulfide, which enabled a self-accelerating chain reaction of sulfur reduction via polysulfide. This stimulation effect was further validated by the 7-h batch tests. In the batch test without sulfide addition initially, a continuous increase in the hourly SPR was observed with increasing sulfide concentration. Furthermore, in the batch tests with the addition of 50-200 mg SIL sulfide at the beginning, the average SPR in the first 3 h increased with elevating initial sulfide concentration due to more polysulfide formation and reduction. However, high sulfide concentration (>250 mg SQL) hindered the continuous increase in SPR. Additionally, when polysulfide formation was prevented through the addition of Fe2+, the SPR dropped by 97.6% compared to that in the presence of polysulfide. This validates the key role of polysulfide in the high-rate sulfur reduction process. Overall, the findings suggest that high-rate sulfur reduction can be achieved for autotrophic denitrification or heavy-metal removal in wastewater treatment. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The National Survey of Disinfection By-Products and Selected Emerging Contaminants investigated the formation of various disinfection by-products and contaminants in 65 water treatment systems (WTSs) across Canada. Results for six iodo-trihalomethanes (iodo-THMs) are reported in this paper. The participating water treatment systems included large, medium and small systems using water sources and treatment processes which were representative of Canadian drinking water. Five water samples (source water, treated water and three water samples along the distribution system) were collected from each treatment system, both under winter and summer conditions. Samples were stabilized, shipped cold and analysed for six iodo-THMs (dichloroiodomethane-DCIM; dibromoiodomethane-DBIM; bromochloroiodomethane-BCIM; chlorodiiodomethane-CDIM; bromodiiodomethane-BDIM and triiodomethane or iodoform-TIM), using a SPME-GC-ECD method developed in our laboratory (MDLs from 0.02 mu g/L for iodoform to 0.06 mu g/L for bromodiiodomethane). Concentrations of relevant precursors like dissolved organic carbon (DOC), bromide, iodide and total iodine, as well as other water quality parameters, were also determined. Detailed information about the treatment process used at each location was recorded using a questionnaire. The survey showed that one or more iodo-THMs were detected at 31 out of 64 water treatment systems (WTSs) under winter conditions and in 46 out of 64 WTSs under summer conditions (analytical results from one site were excluded due to sampling challenges). Total iodo-THM concentrations measured during this survey ranged from 0.02 mu g/L to 21.66 mu g/L. The highest total iodo-THM concentration was measured in WTS 63 where all six iodo-THMs were detected and iodoform was present in the highest concentration. The highest iodo-THM formation was found to occur in treatment systems where water sources had naturally occurring ammonium as well as high bromide, high iodide and/or total iodine concentrations. In two such water systems the total concentration of iodo-THMs exceeded the concentration of regulated THMs. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB A comparative analysis of five different structures of sulfate reduction (SR) models for anaerobic digestion (AD) was conducted to evaluate their accuracy to provide model developers and users with better information to decide on the optimum degree of complexity. The models evaluated differ in terms of the number/type of sulfate reducing bacterial activities considered based on the electron donors used. A systematic calibration of the evaluated models against a large set of experimental data was also conducted using a very recent parameter calibration method. Results indicate that a simple model incorporating both acetate utilizing and hydrogen utilizing sulfate reducing bacterial activities (the M-AH model) achieves a good balance between performance and complexity in terms of prediction errors against experimental data. All the models evaluated provided acceptable predictions except the model including only hydrogen utilizing sulfate reducing bacterial activity. More complex model structures are recommended only if required in specific experimental cases. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Treatment of sugarcane molasses distillery wastewater is challenging due to the presence of complex phenolic compounds (melanoidins and polyphenols) having antioxidant properties. Due to zero liquid discharge regulations, Indian distilleries continue to explore effective treatment options. This work examines the concentration of distillery wastewater by forward osmosis (FO) using aquaporin biomimetic membranes and magnesium chloride hexahydrate (MgCl2 center dot 6H(2)O) as draw solution. The operational parameters viz. feed solution and draw solution flow rate and draw solution concentration were optimized using 10% v/v melanoidins model feed solution. This was followed by trials with distillery wastewater. Under the conditions of this work, feed and draw flow rates of 1 L/min and draw solution concentration of 2M MgCl2 center dot 6H(2)O for melanoidins model solution and 3M MgCl2 center dot 6H(2)O for distillery wastewater were optimal for maximum rejection. Rejection of 90% melanoidins, 96% antioxidant activity and 84% COD was obtained with melanoidins model feed, with a corresponding water flux of 6.3 L/m(2)h. With as-received distillery wastewater, the rejection was similar (85-90%) to the melanoidins solution, but the water flux was lower (2.8 L/m(2)h). Water recovery from distillery wastewater over 24 h study period was higher with FO (70%) than reported for RO (35-45%). Repeated use of the FO membrane over five consecutive 24 h cycles with fresh feed and draw solutions and periodic cleaning showed consistent average water flux and rejection of the feed constituents.

AB The kinetics of fluoride sorption by calcite in the presence of metal ions (Co, Mn, Cd and Ba) have been investigated and modelled using the intra-particle diffusion (IPD), pseudo-second order (PSO), and the Hill 4 and Hill 5 kinetic models. Model comparison using the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), the Schwarz Bayseian Information Criterion (BIC) and the Bayes Factor allows direct comparison of model results irrespective of the number of model parameters. Information Criterion results indicate "very strong" evidence that the Hill 5 model was the best fitting model for all observed data due to its ability to fit sigmoidal data, with confidence contour analysis showing the model parameters were well constrained by the data. Kinetic results were used to determine the thickness of a calcite permeable reactive barrier required to achieve up to 99.9% fluoride removal at a groundwater flow of 0.1 m.day(-1). Fluoride removal half-life (t(0.5)) values were found to increase in the order Ba approximate to stonedust (a 99% pure natural calcite) < Cd < Co < Mn. A barrier width of 0.97 +/- 0.02 m was found to be required for the fluoride/calcite (stonedust) only system when using no factor of safety, whilst in the presence of Mn and Co, the width increased to 2.76 +/- 0.28 and 19.83 +/- 0.37 m respectively. In comparison, the PSO model predicted a required barrier thickness of similar to 46.0, 62.6 & 50.3 m respectively for the fluoride/calcite, Mn and Co systems under the same conditions.

ID DESALINATION
AB Colloidal silica involved fouling behaviors in direct contact membrane distillation (DCMD), vacuum membrane distillation (VMD) and sweeping gas membrane distillation (SGMD) were studied. Three foulants were used in the experiments, including colloidal silica as representative of particulate foulants, calcium bicarbonate as dissolved inorganic foulant, and NOM (humic acid + alginate + BSA) as the dissolved organic foulant. The three types of fouants were combined to produce four different feed waters: silica alone; silica + calcium bicarbonate; silica + NOM; and silica + calcium bicarbonate + NOM. With 25% feed recovery, it was found that VMD showed the worst performance for most of the foulant combinations due to turbulence dead zones caused by the membrane deformation that increased foulant deposition. For the silica + calcium bicarbonate + NOM feed DCMD had the greatest fouling rate, although DCMD also had the highest flux of all configurations. SGMD showed the best fouling resistance of all configurations, although it was inclined to calcium carbonate fouling because carbon dioxide was removed in the permeate leading to calcium carbonate precipitation and could be alleviated by using air as sweeping gas. For feeds containing high-concentration calcium bicarbonate or carbonate foulants, VMD should be avoided to lower the formation of carbonate precipitants on the membrane surface if scale inhibitors are not used.

AB The effect of chitosan on the development of granular sludge in upflow anaerobic sludge blanket reactors (UASB) when treating wastewater polluted with the organic solvents ethanol, ethyl acetate, and 1-ethoxy-2-propanol was evaluated. Three UASB reactors were operated for 219 days at ambient temperature with an organic loading rate (OLR) of between 0.3 kg COD m(-3) d(-1) and 20 kg COD m(-3) d(-1). One reactor was operated without the addition of chitosan, while the other two were operated with the addition of chitosan doses of 2.4 mg gVSS(-1) two times. The three reactors were all able to treat the OLR tested with COD removal efficiencies greater than 90%. However, the time required to reach stable operation was considerably reduced in the chitosan-assisted reactors. The development of granules in the reactors with chitosan was accelerated and granules larger than 2000 mu m were only observed in these reactors. In addition, these granules exhibited better physicochemical characteristics: the mean particle diameter (540 and 613 mu m) was approximately two times greater than in the control reactor (300 mu m), and the settling velocities exceeded 35 m h(-1). The extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) in the reactors with the chitosan was found to be higher than in the control reactor. The protein-EPS content has been correlated with the granule size. The analyses of the microbial communities, performed through denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and high-throughput sequencing, revealed that the syntrophic microorganisms belonging to genus Geobacter and the hydrogenotrophic methanogen Methanocorpusculum labreanum were predominant in the granules. Other methanogens like Methanosaeta species were found earlier in the chitosan-assisted reactors than in the control reactor. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The Klein-Gordon equation with nonlinear potential occurs in a wide range of application areas in science and engineering. Its computation represents a major challenge. The main theme of this paper is the construction of symmetric and arbitrarily high-order time integrators for the nonlinear Klein-Gordon equation by integrating Birkhoff-Hermite interpolation polynomials. To this end, under the assumption of periodic boundary conditions, we begin with the formulation of the nonlinear Klein-Gordon equation as an abstract second-order ordinary differential equation (ODE) and its operator-variation-of-constants formula. We then derive a symmetric and arbitrarily high-order Birkhoff-Hermite time integration formula for the nonlinear abstract ODE. Accordingly, the stability, convergence and long-time behaviour are rigorously analysed once the spatial differential operator is approximated by an appropriate positive semi-definite matrix, subject to suitable temporal and spatial smoothness. A remarkable characteristic of this new approach is that the requirement of temporal smoothness is reduced compared with the traditional numerical methods for PDEs in the literature. Numerical results demonstrate the advantage and efficiency of our time integrators in comparison with the existing numerical approaches. (c) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB A hybrid technique is studied in order to improve the performance of Convolutional Perfectly Matched Layer (CPML) in the Finite Difference Time Domain (FDTD) medium. This technique combines the first order of Higdon's annihilation equation as Absorbing Boundary Condition (ABC) with CPML to vanish the Perfect Electric Conductor (PEC) effects at the end of the CPML region. An optimization algorithm is required to find optimum parameters of the proposed absorber. In this investigation, the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is utilized with two separate objective functions in order to minimize the average and peak value of relative error. Using a standard test, the overall performance of the proposed absorber is compared to the original CPML. The results clearly illustrate this method provides approximately 10 dB enhancements in CPML absorption error. The performance, memory and time requirement of the novel absorber, hybrid CPML (H-CPML), was analyzed during 2D and 3D tests and compared to most reported PMLs. The H-CPML requirement of computer resources is similar to CPML and can simply be implemented to truncate FDTD domains. Furthermore, an optimized set of parameters are provided to generalize the hybrid method. (c) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB This is the third paper on the study of gradient recovery for elliptic interface problems. In our previous works Guo and Yang (2017) [23], we developed gradient recovery methods for elliptic interface problems based on body-fitted meshes and immersed finite element methods. Despite the efficiency and accuracy that these methods bring to recover the gradient, there are still some cases in unfitted meshes where skinny triangles appear in the generated local body-fitted triangulations that destroy the accuracy of recovered gradient near the interface. In this paper, we propose a gradient recovery technique based on Nitsche's method for elliptic interface problems, which avoids the loss of accuracy of gradient near the interface caused by skinny triangles. We analyze the supercloseness between the gradient of the numerical solution by the Nitsche's method and the gradient of the interpolation of the exact solution, which leads to the superconvergence of the proposed gradient recovery method. We also present several numerical examples to validate the theoretical results. (c) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB A diffuse interface model for three-dimensional viscous incompressible two-phase flows is formulated within a bracket formalism using a skew-symmetric Poisson bracket together with a symmetric negative semi-definite dissipative bracket. The budgets of kinetic energy, helicity, and enstrophy derived from the bracket formulations are properly inherited by the finite difference equations obtained by invoking the discrete variational derivative method combined with the mimetic finite difference method. The Cahn-Hilliard and Allen-Cahn equations are employed as diffuse interface models, in which the equalities of densities and viscosities of two different phases are assumed. Numerical experiments on the motion of periodic arrays of tubes and those of droplets have been conducted to examine the properties and usefulness of the proposed method. (c) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

DE Convolution; Implicit dealiasing; Fast Fourier transform;

AB Implicit dealiasing is a method for computing in-place linear convolutions via fast Fourier transforms that decouples work memory from input data. It offers easier memory management and, for long one-dimensional input sequences, greater efficiency than conventional zero-padding. Furthermore, for convolutions of multidimensional data, the segregation of data and work buffers can be exploited to reduce memory usage and execution time significantly. This is accomplished by processing and discarding data as it is generated, allowing work memory to be reused, for greater data locality and performance. A multithreaded implementation of implicit dealiasing that accepts an arbitrary number of input and output vectors and a general multiplication operator is presented, along with an improved one-dimensional Hermitian convolution that avoids the loop dependency inherent in previous work. An alternate data format that can accommodate a Nyquist mode and enhance cache efficiency is also proposed. (c) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB MILU preconditioning is known to be the optimal one among all the ILU-type preconditionings in solving the Poisson equation with Dirichlet boundary condition. It is optimal in the sense that it reduces the condition number from O (h(-2)), which can be obtained from other ILU-type preconditioners, to O (h(-1)). However, with Neumann boundary condition, the conventional MILU cannot be used since it is not invertible, and some MILU preconditionings achieved the order O (h(-1)) only in rectangular domains.
   In this article, we consider a standard finite volume method for solving the Poisson equation with Neumann boundary condition in general smooth domains, and introduce a new and efficient MILU preconditioning for the method in two dimensional general smooth domains. Our new MILU preconditioning achieved the order O (h(-1)) in all our empirical tests. In addition, in a circular domain with a fine grid, the CG method preconditioned with the proposed MILU runs about two times faster than the CG with ILU. (c) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB A moving mesh finite element method is studied for the numerical solution of a phase-field model for brittle fracture. The moving mesh partial differential equation approach is employed to dynamically track crack propagation. Meanwhile, the decomposition of the strain tensor into tensile and compressive components is essential for the success of the phase-field modeling of brittle fracture but results in a non-smooth elastic energy and stronger nonlinearity in the governing equation. This makes the governing equation much more difficult to solve and, in particular, Newton's iteration often fails to converge. Three regularization methods are proposed to smooth out the decomposition of the strain tensor. Numerical examples of fracture propagation under quasi-static load demonstrate that all of the methods can effectively improve the convergence of Newton's iteration for relatively small values of the regularization parameter but without compromising the accuracy of the numerical solution. They also show that the moving mesh finite element method is able to adaptively concentrate the mesh elements around propagating cracks and handle multiple and complex crack systems.

AB Most high order computational fluid dynamics (CFD) methods for compressible flows are based on Riemann solver for the flux evaluation and Runge-Kutta (RK) time stepping technique for temporal accuracy. The advantage of this kind of space-time separation approach is the easy implementation and stability enhancement by introducing more middle stages. However, the nth-order time accuracy needs no less than n stages for the RK method, which can be very time and memory consuming due to the reconstruction at each stage for a high order method. On the other hand, the multi-stage multi-derivative (MSMD) method can be used to achieve the same order of time accuracy using less middle stages with the use of the time derivatives of the flux function. For traditional Riemann solver based CFD methods, the lack of time derivatives in the flux function prevents its direct implementation of the MSMD method. However, the gas kinetic scheme (GKS) provides such a time accurate evolution model. By combining the second-order or third-order GKS flux functions with the MSMD technique, a family of high order gas kinetic methods can be constructed. As an extension of the previous 2-stage 4th-order GKS, the 5th-order schemes with 2 and 3 stages will be developed in this paper. Based on the same 5th-order WENO reconstruction, the performance of gas kinetic schemes from the 2nd- to the 5th-order time accurate methods will be evaluated. The results show that the 5th-order scheme can achieve the theoretical order of accuracy for the Euler equations, and present accurate Navier-Stokes solutions as well due to the coupling of inviscid and viscous terms in the GKS formulation. In comparison with Riemann solver based 5th-order RK method, the high order GKS has advantages in terms of efficiency, accuracy, and robustness, for all test cases. The 4th-and 5th-order GKS have the same robustness as the 2nd-order scheme for the capturing of discontinuous solutions. The current high order MSMD GKS is a multi-dimensional scheme with incorporation of both normal and tangential spatial derivatives of flow variables at a cell interface in the flux evaluation. The scheme can be extended straightforwardly to viscous flow computation in unstructured mesh. It provides a promising direction for the development of high-order CFD methods for the computation of complex flows, such as turbulence and acoustics with shock interactions. (c) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

AB It has long been suggested that a purely Lagrangian solution to global-scale atmospheric/oceanic flows can potentially outperform tradition Eulerian schemes. Meanwhile, a demonstration of a scalable and practical framework remains elusive. Motivated by recent progress in particle-based methods when applied to convection dominated flows, this work presents a fully Lagrangian method for solving the inviscid shallow water equations on a rotating sphere in a smooth particle hydrodynamics framework. To avoid singularities at the poles, the governing equations are solved in Cartesian coordinates, augmented with a Lagrange multiplier to ensure that fluid particles are constrained to the surface of the sphere. An underlying grid in spherical coordinates is used to facilitate efficient neighbor detection and parallelization. The method is applied to a suite of canonical test cases, and conservation, accuracy, and parallel performance are assessed. (c) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB We present here numerical modelling of granular flows with the mu(I) rheology in confined channels. The contribution is twofold: (i) a model to approximate the Navier-Stokes equations with the mu(I) rheology through an asymptotic analysis; under the hypothesis of a one-dimensional flow, this model takes into account side walls friction; (ii) a multilayer discretization following Fernandez-Nieto et al. (2016) [20]. In this new numerical scheme, we propose an appropriate treatment of the rheological terms through a hydrostatic reconstruction which allows this scheme to be well-balanced and therefore to deal with dry areas. Based on academic tests, we first evaluate the influence of the width of the channel on the normal profiles of the downslope velocity thanks to the multilayer approach that is intrinsically able to describe changes from Bagnold to S-shaped (and vice versa) velocity profiles. We also check the well-balanced property of the proposed numerical scheme. We show that approximating side walls friction using single-layer models may lead to strong errors. Secondly, we compare the numerical results with experimental data on granular collapses. We show that the proposed scheme allows us to qualitatively reproduce the deposit in the case of a rigid bed (i.e. dry area) and that the error made by replacing the dry area by a small layer of material may be large if this layer is not thin enough. The proposed model is also able to reproduce the time evolution of the free surface and of the flow/no-flow interface. In addition, it reproduces the effect of erosion for granular flows over initially static material lying on the bed. This is possible when using a variable friction coefficient mu(I) but not with a constant friction coefficient. (c) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB In this paper we consider discontinuous Galerkin (DG) methods for the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in the framework of projection methods. In particular we employ symmetric interior penalty DG methods within the second-order rotational incremental pressure correction scheme. The major focus of the paper is threefold: i) We propose a modified upwind scheme based on the Vijayasundaram numerical flux that has favourable properties in the context of DG. ii) We present a novel postprocessing technique in the Helmholtz projection step based on H(div) reconstruction of the pressure correction that is computed locally, is a projection in the discrete setting and ensures that the projected velocity satisfies the discrete continuity equation exactly. As a consequence it also provides local mass conservation of the projected velocity. iii) Numerical results demonstrate the properties of the scheme for different polynomial degrees applied to two-dimensional problems with known solution as well as large-scale three-dimensional problems. In particular we address second-order convergence in time of the splitting scheme as well as its long-time stability. (c) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB This paper presents a hybrid Wave Based Method - Finite Element unit cell method to predict the absorption, reflection and transmission properties of arbitrary, two-dimensional periodic structures. The planar periodic structure, represented by its unit cell combined with Bloch-Floquet periodicity boundary conditions, is modelled within the Finite Element Method, allowing to represent complex geometries and to include any type of physics. The planar periodic structure is coupled to semi-infinite acoustic domains above and/or below, in which the dynamic pressure field is modelled with the Wave Based Method, applying a wave function set that fulfills the Helmholtz equation and satisfies the Sommerfeld radiation condition and the Bloch-Floquet periodicity conditions inherently. The dynamic fields described within both frameworks are coupled using a direct coupling strategy, accounting for the mutual dynamic interactions via a weighted residual formulation. The method explicitly accounts for the interaction between the unit cell and the surrounding acoustic domain, also accounting for higher order periodic waves. The convergence of the method is analysed and its applicability is shown for a variety of problems, proving it to be a useful tool combining the strengths of two methods. (c) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

AB In this paper, static and dynamic properties of the smoothed dissipative particle dynamics (SDPD) method are investigated. We study the effect of method parameters on SDPD fluid properties, such as structure, speed of sound, and transport coefficients, and show that a proper choice of parameters leads to a well-behaved and accurate fluid model. In particular, the speed of sound, the radial distribution function (RDF), shear-thinning of viscosity, the mean-squared displacement (< R-2 > alpha t), and the Schmidt number (Sc similar to O(10(3)) - O(10(4))) can be controlled, such that the model exhibits a fluid-like behavior for a wide range of temperatures in simulations. Furthermore, in addition to the consideration of fluid density variations for fluid compressibility, a more challenging test of incompressibility is performed by considering the Poisson ratio and divergence of velocity field in an elongational flow. Finally, as an example of complex-fluid flow, we present the applicability and validity of the SDPD method with an appropriate choice of parameters for the simulation of cellular blood flow in irregular geometries. In conclusion, the results demonstrate that the SDPD method is able to approximate well a nearly incompressible fluid behavior, which includes hydrodynamic interactions and consistent thermal fluctuations, thereby providing, a powerful approach for simulations of complex mesoscopic systems.

AB Many biological examples of fluid-structure interaction, including the transit of red blood cells through the narrow slits in the spleen and the intracellular trafficking of vesicles into dendritic spines, involve the near-contact of elastic structures separated by thin layers of fluid. Motivated by such problems, we introduce an immersed boundary method that uses elements of lubrication theory to resolve thin fluid layers between immersed boundaries. We demonstrate 2nd-order accurate convergence for simple two-dimensional flows with known exact solutions to showcase the increased accuracy of this method compared to the standard immersed boundary method. Motivated by the phenomenon of wall-induced migration, we apply the lubricated immersed boundary method to simulate an elastic vesicle near a wall in shear flow. We also simulate the dynamics of a vesicle traveling through a narrow channel and observe the ability of the lubricated method to capture the vesicle motion on relatively coarse fluid grids.

AB Full spectrum of a large sparse inverted perpendicular-palindromic quadratic eigenvalue problem inverted perpendicular-PQEP) is considered arguably for the first time in this article. Such a problem is posed by calculation of surface Green's functions SGFs) of mesoscopic transistors with a tremendous non-periodic cross-section. For this problem, general purpose eigensolvers are not efficient, nor is advisable to resort to the decimation method etc. to obtain the Wiener-Hopf factorization. After reviewing some rigorous understanding of SGF calculation from the perspective of inverted perpendicular-PQEP and nonlinear matrix equation, we present our new approach to this problem. In a nutshell, the unit disk where the spectrum of interest lies is broken down adaptively into pieces small enough that they each can be locally tackled by the generalized inverted perpendicular-skew-Hamiltonian implicitly restarted shift-and-invert Arnoldi G inverted perpendicular SHIRA) algorithm with suitable shifts and other parameters, and the eigenvalues missed by this divide-and-conquer strategy can be recovered thanks to the accurate estimation provided by our newly developed scheme. Notably the novel non-equivalence deflation is proposed to avoid as much as possible duplication of nearby known eigenvalues when a new shift of G inverted perpendicular SHIRA is determined. We demonstrate our new approach by calculating the SGF of a realistic nanowire whose unit cell is described by a matrix of size 4000 x 4000 at the density functional tight binding level, corresponding to a 8 x 8 nm(2) cross-section. We believe that quantum transport simulation of realistic nano-devices in the mesoscopic regime will greatly benefit from this work. (c) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Many applications including optimal design and adaptive discretization techniques involve solving several boundary value problems on geometries that are local perturbations of an original geometry. This manuscript presents a fast direct solver for boundary value problems that are recast as boundary integral equations. The idea is to write the discretized boundary integral equation on a new geometry as a low rank update to the discretized problem on the original geometry. Using the Sherman-Morrison formula, the inverse can be expressed in terms of the inverse of the original system applied to the low rank factors and the right hand side. Numerical results illustrate for problems where perturbation is localized the fast direct solver is three times faster than building a new solver from scratch. (c) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

AB We present a new predictor-corrector approach to enforcing local maximum principles in piecewise-linear finite element schemes for the compressible Euler equations. The new element-based limiting strategy is suitable for continuous and discontinuous Galerkin methods alike. In contrast to synchronized limiting techniques for systems of conservation laws, we constrain the density, momentum, and total energy in a sequential manner which guarantees positivity preservation for the pressure and internal energy. After the density limiting step, the total energy and momentum gradients are adjusted to incorporate the irreversible effect of density changes. Antidiffusive corrections to bounds-compatible low-order approximations are limited to satisfy inequality constraints for the specific total and kinetic energy. An accuracy-preserving smoothness indicator is introduced to gradually adjust lower bounds for the element-based correction factors. The employed smoothness criterion is based on a Hessian determinant test for the density. A numerical study is performed for test problems with smooth and discontinuous solutions.

AB This paper investigates the computation of the forced response of elastic open waveguides with a numerical modal approach based on perfectly matched layers (PML). With a PML of infinite thickness, the solution can theoretically be expanded as a discrete sum of trapped modes, a discrete sum of leaky modes and a continuous sum of radiation modes related to the PML branch cuts. Yet with numerical methods (e.g. finite elements), the waveguide cross-section is discretized and the PML must be truncated to a finite thickness. This truncation transforms the continuous sum into a discrete set of PML modes. To guarantee the uniqueness of the numerical solution of the forced response problem, an orthogonality relationship is proposed. This relationship is applicable to any type of modes (trapped, leaky and PML modes) and hence allows the numerical solution to be expanded on a discrete sum in a convenient manner. This also leads to an expression for the modal excitability valid for leaky modes. The physical relevance of each type of mode for the solution is clarified through two numerical test cases, a homogeneous medium and a circular bar waveguide example, excited by a point source. The former is favourably compared to a transient analytical solution, showing that PML modes reassemble the bulk wave contribution in a homogeneous medium. The latter shows that the PML mode contribution yields the long-term diffraction phenomenon whereas the leaky mode contribution prevails closer to the source. The leaky mode contribution is shown to remain accurate even with a relatively small PML thickness, hence reducing the computational cost. This is of particular interest for solving three-dimensional waveguide problems, involving two-dimensional cross-sections of arbitrary shapes. Such a problem is handled in a third numerical example by considering a buried square bar. (c) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB We present and analyze an entropy-stable semi-discretization of the Euler equations based on high-order summation-by-parts (SBP) operators. In particular, we consider general multidimensional SBP elements, building on and generalizing previous work with tensor-product discretizations. In the absence of dissipation, we prove that the semi-discrete scheme conserves entropy; significantly, this proof of nonlinear L-2 stability does not rely on integral exactness. Furthermore, interior penalties can be incorporated into the discretization to ensure that the total (mathematical) entropy decreases monotonically, producing an entropy-stable scheme. SBP discretizations with curved elements remain accurate, conservative, and entropy stable provided the mapping Jacobian satisfies the discrete metric invariants; polynomial mappings at most one degree higher than the SBP operators automatically satisfy the metric invariants in two dimensions. In three-dimensions, we describe an elementwise optimization that leads to suitable Jacobians in the case of polynomial mappings. The properties of the semi-discrete scheme are verified and investigated using numerical experiments. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Sheared E x B flow in a tokamak, driven by external torque from neutral beam injection, is known to have an important stabilizing effect on drift-wave turbulence. In gyrokinetic codes, flow shear can be implemented directly on a radial mesh with nonperiodic boundary conditions. The mesh-based implementation is straightforward, but carries the possibility of spurious effects related to simulation boundaries. Alternatively, flow shear has been implemented in spectral solvers using a wavenumber shift method. Although the spectral representation has numerous computational benefits, the wavenumber shift method for treating flow shear is of questionable accuracy. Efforts to compare mesh-based solutions with spectral ones have met with limited success. In particular, significant differences in the critical shear required to stabilize turbulence are sometimes observed. We outline a new approach to treat flow shear spectrally. The method is simple to implement, matches the nonperiodic results more closely, and predicts a critical shear that is less sensitive to radial wavenumber resolution. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

The nanoparticles were synthesized by sol-gel method using supercritical drying in ethyl alcohol. The structural studied by X-ray diffractometry indicates that calcium-doped zinc oxide has a polycrystalline hexagonal wurzite structure. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) measurements have shown that very small particles of CZO are present in the aerogel powder.

AB Hollow metal nanoparticles were produced from a low-melting point alloy, by preventing oxidation of molten metal during fabrication. Molten metal droplets were generated in the water above it by disintegrating bubbles in the molten metal, resulting in the fabrication of metal nanoparticles, accompanied by cooling of the water phase. The hollow structure of the metal nanoparticles was theorized to have occurred due to the Kirkendall effect during oxidation. With the method of applying ultrasonically generated gas-microbubbles, solid/hollow particles were selectively generated by changing the gas supply from oxidizing to non-oxidizing.

AB We have discovered a rare opportunity to operate by the SHG at fundamental wavelength 10.6 mu m of microsecond CO2 laser during simultaneous irradiation by 1064/532 nm bicolor laser beams of (60-x-y) TeO2-10B(2)O(3)-10BaO-10ZnO-10Na(2)O-(x)Er2O3-(y) Pr6O11 (x = 0.5, 1.0; y = 0); (x = 0; y = 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5); (x = 0.5,1.0; y = 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5) (mol%) glasses. The effect has shown a drastic sensitivity of the effect to the Er/Pr ratio. The effect exists only during the simultaneous illumination and applied dc-electric field at 5 kV/cm. Only completely reversible changes were observed. The effect is a consequence of photopolarization during the bicolor coherent laser beams and its efficiency is determined by the transfer of excitation between the Er and Pr ions.

AB In this study, we develop a novel method to prepare polyamide-6 (PA6) microspheres with designed morphology. The diameter range of the PA6 microspheres is controlled at 200 nm similar to 500 nm by adding a certain amount of sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) surfactant in the polyamide-6/polyethylene glycol (PA6/PEG) system. The key strategy for the method is to induce phase inversion by PEG in the synthesis process. PEG and SDS are removed with water and without any toxicity to environment. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) and transmission electron microscope (TEM) have confirmed that the PA6 spherical morphologies. The crystallization behaviour of PA6 microspheres is investigated using X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Differential scanning calorimeter (DSC). We believe this strategy can be applied to prepare a variety of microspheres materials. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB 3D SiC network was synthesized by carbothermal reduction using phenolic resin and tetraethoxysilane (TEOS) as raw materials without substrate at 1300 degrees C. The images of scanning electron microscopy and X-ray pattern indicated that the whole frame was set up by SiC fibers and the diameter of SiC fibers is around 900 nm. The formation of 3D SiC network has followed a continuous VLS-VS growth process. The combined effect of acid and alkali on overall architecture formation has been described. In addition, we found the intersection of Ni droplet in stem is essential for the formation of 3D SiC network. Such structure is of great significance to the light emitting diodes (LED) and optoelectronics devices. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB High entropy alloy composites (HEACs), Al0.3FeNiCo1.2CrCu reinforced by Titanium carbide (TiC) particles were produced by mechanical alloying (MA) and spark plasma sintering (SPS). The results from X-ray diffraction (XRD) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) shows that a single FCC solid-solution phase with certain nanoscale deformation twins are produced following SPS. Subsequent investigations characterize the mechanical properties and microstructure of nanocrystalline twin HEAs by high resolution electron microscope (HREM) and compression tests. The produced interface was found to be clear and well bonded. The compressive yield strength, fracture strength, plastic strain and hardness are found to be 1730 +/- 15 MPa, 2260 +/- 15 MPa, 29.50% and 645Hv, respectively. This is attributed to the twin strengthening and the presence of uniformly distributed TiC particles. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Polycrystalline NiTi pillars of 0.5 mu m diameter and 1.5 mu m height with average grain sizes from 10 to 421 nm are fabricated by focused ion beam and compressed by nanoindentation. It is found that stress-strain hysteresis loop area, transformation stress and transformation strain vary non-monotonically with grain size. Analysis of the results reveals that increasing the grain size from 10 nm enhances the transformation by promoting the nucleation and growth of martensite domains. When the grain size approaches the pillar size, the transformation is suppressed by an increase in granular constraints and heterogeneity of internal stress-strain state among large grains.

The influence of arginine content on structure, mechanical, surface and biological properties of the scaffolds was investigated. It was found that arginine addition reduces diameter of the scaffold fibers and doesn't impair mechanical properties of the polymer. Porosity and water contact angle of the scaffold were independent from arginine content. The best adhesion and viability of multipotent mesenchymal stem cells was shown on scaffolds with arginine concentration from 0.5 to 1% wt. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Smart nanocarriers that can respond to specific signals have recently gained attention in clinical research. Through the scaffolded DNA origami technique, we developed an aptamer-functionalized DNA nano-sphere that could change its conformation upon binding to cancer-specific Mucin 1 protein (MUC1). A MUC1 aptamer was added into the lock-and-key system of the DNA nanosphere, and specific binding of the aptamer and MUC1 triggered the opening of the structure. A decrease in FRET signals demonstrated that the DNA nanosphere underwent structural change to the open conformation in response to the MUC1-containing cell lysate. Gold nanoparticles were also successfully encapsulated inside the cavity, implicating its loading ability. Our data confirmed that the aptamer-modified DNA nanosphere has proved to be a responsive nanocarrier and may serve as a promising candidate for cancer theranostic purposes. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

A new type of coatings with high content of NH groups has been prepared in a single step plasma process. Deposition is performed by atmospheric pressure plasma which is coupled to aerosol injection of liquid precursor. The method is applied for the polymerization of N, N'-methylenebisacrylamide precursor. The surface analyses, including X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and Fourier Transform Infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), show polymerization of the precursor with formation of amide-rich coatings with up to 8 at.% of N-containing groups. The coatings are stable in phosphate buffer saline (PBS) solution and characterized by improved biocompatibility to STEM cells. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB CdS decorated TiO2 nanotubes were successfully prepared by the combination of electrospinning and solvothermal method. By changing the reaction conditions, the CdS nanoparticles present a pine-cone shaped three-dimensional (3D) structure. The morphology and composition of the resulting hybrid nanotubes were tailored through changing the reaction condition. Their photocatalytic properties were evaluated by degradation of methyl orange dye under UV and visible light irradiation, and showing enhanced photocatalytic activity compared with pure TiO2 and CdS counterparts. Which may have a good potential application in solving environmental problems, providing a simple and efficient method for manufacturing hollow tubes. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Novel ZnO nanosheets (NSs)/nanocrystalline aggregates (NAs) composite films were constructed by depositing a ZnO NAs directly on the surfaces of pre-fabricated ZnO NSs through a dip-coating method. The morphology and performance of dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) were studied. The top layers of ZnO NAs improved the light scattering of composite films. The bottom layers of ZnO NSs consisted of 20-30 nm nanoparticle has a single crystal structure. In addition, ZnO NSs is vertical conductive substrate, so the bottom layers of ZnO NSs layer have a larger specific surface area and good electron transport. Based on the above advantages, the photoelectric conversion efficiency (PCE) of DSSCs assembled by the ZnO NSs/NAs composite films is 7.95%, which is 81.51% higher than that of ZnO NSs and is close to the highest PCE that has ever been reported (8.03%).

AB Long-term thermal stability of nickel line patterns was investigated. 5 mu m-wide patterns and 20 mu m-wide patterns were deposited with four different thicknesses, and their morphological change was compared after heat treatment. Displaced volume was calculated by post-annealing image analysis. Opposite coarsening trends were found for the two tested widths. 20 mu m-wide patterns show deviation from predictions of previous models, but they still behave as expected: thinner pattern shows higher mobility. This is reversed for 5 mu m-wide patterns. Surface tension at the metal-gas interface, the usual driving force behind coarsening, can still explain the unexpected displaced volume dependence on thickness. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB I-ions doped (BiO)(2)CO3 (denoted as I-BOC) was prepared by a facile and rapid solid-state chemical reaction route. As compared to pure BOC, the I-BOC exhibited excellent visible-light-driven photocatalytic activity for rhodamine B (RhB) degradation even when RhB concentration reached 20 mg/L (catalyst, 0.4 g/L). Furthermore, the as-prepared I-BOC also exhibited good visible light photocatalytic activity for the degradation of methylene blue (MB), crystal violet (CV) and salicylic acid (SA). The investigation on the photocatalytic mechanism indicated that the doping of I- ions decreased the particles size and band gap simultaneously, which resulted in an increase in the exposed active centers and visible light absorption range, thus enhancing visible light photoactivity.

AB Functionally graded nanocrystalline silicon powder, having varied bandgap. has been prepared using mechanical alloying technique. The solar grade (99.999% pure) nanocrystalline silicon (nc-Si) powder was ball milled in argon atmosphere in an attrition mill for 4 h to 20 h (4 h, 12 h and 20 h) to reduce crystallite size in it. The milled powder samples were then degassed, to remove entrapped gases, in a vacuum of 10(-2) torr at 200 degrees C for 1 h. Transmission electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction studies show the crystallite size of all the powders are in the nanometer range and decrease in crystallite size was seen with increasing milling time. Raman spectroscopy shows nanocrystalline phases in the milled powder particles with 100% crystalline volume fraction. UV-Vis-IR spectroscopy was used to determine bandgap of the powder samples using Tauc formula. The bandgap and crystallite size in silicon powder is found to be the function of milling duration, without addition of any alloying element. The nc-Si powder with different bandgaps may find potential applications in the field of functionally graded solar cells. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The flow stress by basal slip showed a weakly positive or negligible strain-rate dependence, while the flow stress accompanied by the formation of deformation kink bands showed a unique negative strain-rate dependence. These results give the first experimental evidence on the recent proposal that Zn and Y atoms segregate at the kink band boundaries and hinder their migration, from the viewpoint of the mechanical properties.

AB A facile one-step microwave-assisted synthetic route was developed to prepare ultrathin and defect free CuO nanosheets without any surfactant. During the synthetic process, the 100 mL of water and ethanol mixed solution (1/1, v/v) containing 0.86 g of CuCl2 center dot 2H(2)O and 2 g of sodium hydroxide was heated by microwave irradiation at a power of 750W for 20 min. Most of these CuO sheets possessed a length of 80-110 nm, 40-60 nm in width, and only 11 nm in thickness. The microstructure and morphologies of the CuO product were investigated in details by XRD, SEM, HRTEM, FT-IR, and XPS techniques, and it was found that the shapes of CuO were dependent on the concentrations of sodium hydroxide. The band gap of such CuO nanosheets was estimated to be 2.17 eV according to the UV-vis absorption curve. This effective microwave-assisted approach may be a promising route to prepare other transition metal oxides. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Spiropyran as photo-and mechano-response material has attracted great attention for wide applications. However, there are few reports on the mechanoresponsive self-assembly of spiropyran with tunable morphologies. In this work, spiropyran doped PDMS films with mechanic and photo dual response are fabricated by novel biomimetic methods. Interestingly, the morphologies of these films can be transformed from smooth surface to small hole structures due to the self-assembly of spiropyran. Only mechanical forces can induce the morphological changes of the films accordingly the conversion of ring-closed spiropyran and ring-opened merocyanine. In addition, these films exhibit good photoresponsive properties: reversible changes of UV-Vis absorption, colour and wettability. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The metal-ligand complex (sacrificial bonds) that exist in the mussels, bone and silk can dissipate energy and reinforce mechanical strength. Inspired by the high performance of metal-ligand complex, we introduced a kind of metal-ligand crosslink into the rubber network. In this work, ethylene acrylic elastomer (AEM) was filled with ZnO, and was cured by the amine cure system. The metal-ligand crosslink structure was verified by FTIR and XPS, and the tensile strength and dynamic properties were examined with a universal testing machine and rubber process analyzer (RPA). The results showed that coordination crosslink formed in the AEM matrix and exhibited outstanding tensile strength and unexpected dynamic properties due to the coordination bonds between Zn2+ and amine group.

AB Hierarchical nanostructured polypyrrole (HNPPy) of spherical polypyrrole (PPy) nanoparticles anchored on the surface of PPy nanofiber network is prepared by a facile process and incorporated into dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs) as Pt-free counter electrode. This unique hierarchical nanostructure can provide the fast electron-transport pathway and abundant electrocatalytic active sites simultaneously. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy analysis demonstrates that the electrocatalytic activity of HNPPy electrode for the I-3 reduction is higher than that of PPy nanoparticles (PPyNPs) electrode and comparable to that of Pt electrode. As a consequence, the DSC fabricated with HNPPy counter electrode achieves a high conversion efficiency of 6.78%, which is close to the efficiency using Pt counter electrode. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB A novel beta-stabilized Ti-43Al-9V-0.2Y alloy sheet with a nano-scaled antiphase domain (APD) microstructure and excellent performance was fabricated via hot-pack rolling in the (alpha + gamma) phase region (1260 degrees C). Owing to the temperature drop and reheat associated with multi-pass rolling, heterogeneous and regular APD-mixed lamellar structures formed with the occurrence of alpha -> beta + gamma and alpha -> alpha(2) + gamma phase transformations. The antiphase boundary (APB) between two nano-scaled APD structures (average size: similar to 15 nm) is identified as a type of atomic shift, which is induced by the disorder-order transformation in the alpha(2) phase. Moreover, compared with the corresponding as-forged alloy and other hot-working beta-stabilized TiAl alloys, the current alloy sheet exhibited higher strength both at room and elevated temperatures. The improvement in the tensile properties is attributed mainly to the duplex microstructure consisting of fine nano-scaled APD/lamella mixed structures. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Hydrogels mineralized with calcium phosphate (CaP) are increasingly popular bone regeneration biomaterials. Mineralization can be achieved by phosphatase enzyme incorporation and incubation in calcium glycerophosphate (CaGP). Gellan gum (GG) hydrogels containing the enzyme phytase and chitosan oligomer were mineralized in CaGP solution and characterized with human osteoblast-like MG63 cells and adipose tissue-derived stem cells (ADSC). Phytase induced CaP formation. Chitosan concentration determined mineralization extent and hydrogel mechanical reinforcement. Phytase-induced mineralization promoted MG63 adhesion and proliferation, especially in the presence of chitosan, and was non-toxic to MG63 cells (with and without chitosan). ADSC adhesion and proliferation were poor without mineralization. Chitosan did not affect ADSC osteogenic differentiation. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB As a typical failure characteristic gas dissolved in transformer oil, C2H2 has a great significance to evaluate the running state of transformer by monitoring its content. Previous reports mainly focus on organizing WO3 nanoscale building blocks into well-defined 3D nanostructures. However, little attention has been paid to different 1D building blocks on the impact of gas sensing properties. In this work, nanorod and nanowire-assembled WO3 porous networks were controllably synthesized, which were applied to C2H2 detection. In comparison, sensor based on the latter exhibited superior performance than the former one, which seems indicate the significance of electronic transport in gas sensing process. It is proposed that the former possesses numerous nanojunctions between nanorods, while the latter has features with larger capping area and less junction density. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB Based on the twin planes formed at 3000 mu m/s, the growth stability of twinned dendrites in Al-4.5 wt% Cu alloy was studied in detail at a low growth rate during Bridgman solidification. Experimental results show that the twinned dendrite growth could still keep stable even after decreasing the rate to 20 mu m/s. This is far below the usual rate threshold for the formation of twinned dendrites (similar to 1000 mu m/s). The dominated twinned structures at 20 mu m/s have their (1 1 1) twin plane and < 1 1 0 > dendritic trunk closest to thermal gradient direction. Importantly, distinct stacking fault (SF) structures directly connecting two adjacent twin boundaries provide a direct experimental evidence for the close correlation between the SFs and the twinned dendrite growth in aluminum alloys.

AB From direct observations and measurements at the atomic scale by atom probe tomography coupled with calculations using a mean-field approach, the kinetics of low temperature carbon redistribution in martensite of a Fe-Ni-C alloy was investigated for duration up to 4.5 years. The results suggest that the ordered phase alpha ''-Fe16C2 forms via a spinodal decomposition mechanism, in the range of a few days at room-temperature. The approach proposed allows us to retrieve the diffusivity of carbon in a large composition range during decomposition kinetics of martensite into alpha-Fe and alpha ''-Fe16C2.

AB AlGaN-containing ultraviolet light-emitting diodes (UV LEDs) emitting at 285 nm show abnormal diode characteristics below the sub-threshold input voltage region, indicating the existence of a space-charge-limited (SCL) current. Distinct transitions from Ohmic to SCL and further diode currents are observed in UV LEDs, unlike GaInN-based LEDs. Under varied temperatures, the transition voltages from Ohmic to SCL currents and the exponents of the power functions in the current-voltage dependency are influenced by the deactivated trap density in the AlGaN film, indicating that the charge injection and compensation limit for the current within the films in the low-voltage regimes for nitride-based UV LEDs.

AB The synthesis of novel degradable hydrogels, with designable structures and good biocompatibility, produces attractive materials for use in connective tissue regeneration applications. However, the way in which human fibroblast cells respond to terpolymer hydrogels such as collagen-polyvinylpyrrolidone-polyethylene glycol (C-PVP-PEG) remains largely unknown. The aim of this study was to synthesize a gamma-radiation-induced C-PVP-PEG hydrogel and to evaluate its structure, morphology and cell viability in fibroblasts. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy showed shifting of amide I to higher frequencies, as evidence of crosslinking produced by the radiation. The morphology of the hydrogel varied with the ratio of the polymers. We show a proposal for the mechanism of the hydrogel synthesis. The in vitro assessment of the hydrogels suggested that at 50 kGy, the presence of collagen decreased the cell viability for all samples, except for C-PVP. However, when PEG and PVP were added to the collagen, the cell's viability increased with respect to the irradiated collagen sample. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The low temperature fired Ni0.5Ti0.5NbO4 + xwt% BiVO4 (2.5 <= x <= 10) ceramics were prepared through the solid state synthesis methods, effects of various contents of BiVO4 on different phases, microstructures and microwave dielectric properties for Ni0.5Ti0.5NbO4 were researched systematically. The sintering temperatures of Ni0.5Ti0.5NbO4 ceramics can be effectively decreased from 1100 degrees C to 900 degrees C by adding 10 wt% BiVO4 ceramics, and the sintering relative density over 96% could be prepared at 900 degrees C, meanwhile the temperature coefficient of the resonant frequency were decreased as the BiVO4 additions increased. Typically, preferred dielectric properties of Ni0.5Ti0.5NbO4 + 10 wt%BiVO4 composites with epsilon(r) = 56.7, Q x f = 7062 GHz, tau(f) = +55.59 ppm/degrees C were obtained when they were sintered at 900 degrees C.

The dopants induced a morphological evolution and crystalline lattice expansion of the WOx nanostructures. By analyzing the surface composition and oxidation state ratios of W5+/W6+ in each sample using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, we attempt to interpret the observed CL spectra shift from ultraviolet to blue emission of the Ce- and La-doped nanowires.

AB An investigation was conducted to evaluate the effect of annealing at different temperatures on the tensile properties of ultrafine-grained 316L stainless steel processed by high-pressure torsion (HPT). A "moderate-temperature" annealing at 740 K resulted in reduced strength and elongation due to the annihilation of mobile dislocations. A "high-temperature" annealing at 1000 K yielded a remarkably good combination of yield strength (similar to 1330 MPa) and elongation to failure (similar to 43%) which can be attributed to the almost full reversion of alpha'-martensite formed during HPT into gamma-austenite while the grain size remained very fine with a value of about 200 nm.

AB The third-order optical nonlinearities of Ag2Se nanocrystals were investigated by using Z-scan techniques. Large optical susceptibility chi((3)) with the imaginary and real parts of 5.0 x 10(-11) esu and -(3.0 +/- 0.2) x 10(-9) esu has been obtained under 1 mW laser excitation, which is believed to originate from the intrinsic nonlinearity of Ag2Se nanocrystals. When 150 mW excitation power was applied, multiple diffraction rings were observed. The kinetic imaging results demonstrate that the rings originate from the self-phase modulations caused by the intrinsic nonlinearity and the thermal effect. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

ID FABRICATION
AB Oblique and the vertical Co-doped ZnO nanorod arrays were successfully synthesized on a flexible polyethylene naphthalate (PEN) substrate using chemical bath deposition method. The metal-semiconductor-metal (MSM) configuration was used to fabricate UV photodetector based on the Co-doped ZnO nanorods grown on a flexible PEN substrate. At 5 V bias voltage, the calculated responsivity of the UV photodetector was 8.76 A/W. Meanwhile, calculated photosensitivity of the UV photodetector was 250 at bias voltage of 5 V. Under 5 V applied bias voltage, the UV photodetector based on Co-doped ZnO nanorods showed fast response time of 0.229 s and recovery time of 0.276 s. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The photocatalytic activity improvement of AgBr/Cu/CuFe2O4 composite could be attributed to the efficient space separation of photogenerated charge carriers through a Z-scheme configuration.

DE TiO2 nanotubes; Oxidation; Ribs; Additional compact layer;

ID MORPHOLOGY; ELECTROLYTES; GROWTH; MECHANISM
AB Anodic TiO2 nanotubes (ATNTs) are formed by anodization of Ti in fluoride electrolytes. However, the formation of ribs around the nanotubes has not been elucidated clearly. Here, an effective approach is proposed to inhibit the formation of ribs by introducing an additional compact layer (ACL). ACL is formed in electrolyte without fluoride, which can block the electrolyte entering into the gaps and consequently avoid the formation of ribs around ATNTs. This proves that ribs are oxide formation at the titanium interface due to the discontinuous access of electrolyte between nanotubes. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Nonwoven polyamide nanofibers have extensive applications in a wide range of areas. However, a general problem of polyamide nanofiber is a poor adhesion to other materials or to microorganisms. In this work, we exposed nonwoven polyamide nanofibers to ultraviolet, long-wave (UV-A) radiation for different times and studied the changes in surface and bulk properties by available techniques. Obtained results confirmed the changes in surface chemistry, polarity, charge, roughness and morphology. Also changes in crystallinity portion and alpha and gamma phases were observed. We confirmed that the UV-A radiation can be used for surface activation and adhesion improvement. These changes are more visible and significant after short radiation time (till 10 min).

AB This work investigates the difference in viability of primary human foetal osteoblast cells on a glass-ceramic surface with nanoscale topography relative to viability on a smooth glass-ceramic surface containing a bioactive phase. Apatite-mullite glass-ceramics containing bioactive fluorapatite (Ca-10(PO4)(6)F-2) and bioinert mullite (Si2Al6O13) were synthesised and subsequent heat-treatment was optimised to form nano-sized fluorapatite crystals. Etching was used to selectively remove the bioactive phase, producing a surface with disordered nanoscale topography. Cells were seeded onto a smooth polished glass-ceramic substrate with the bioactive phase intact, an etched nanostructured glass-ceramic with the bioactive phase removed, and a borosilicate glass control. Cell viability after 24 h and 48 h was significantly greater on the nanostructured surface compared to the smooth bioactive surface, while cell viability at both time points was significantly greater on both nanostructured and smooth bioactive surfaces compared to the control.

AB Different dendritic grain morphology of an Al-Cu alloy was obtained by adjusting the casting parameters. Compared to the equiaxed dendritic grains, the tortuous dendritic grains led to increased tensile elongation (from 10.4% to 16.8%) and work of fracture (from 11.2 J/mm(2) to 17.2 J/mm(2)) by more than 50%, respectively. Meanwhile, the high tensile strength (similar to 540 MPa) and grain size (similar to 80 mu m) were unchanged. The intergranular fracture crack zigzagged along tortuous grain boundaries, reducing the stress concentration at the crack tip and increasing the propagation resistance and path, leading to increased toughness and elongation. The zigzag morphology of grain boundaries was attributed to tortuous dendritic grains. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A facile and two-step procedure, sputtering followed by annealing, was adopted to achieve highly dispersed gold nanoparticles on SnO2 film. Morphological observations revealed that the gold nanoparticles were uniformly dispersed over the surface of SnO2 film. The transmittance and crystallinity of the as-fabricated film was found to improve substantially after the heat treatment. The suitability of the as-fabricated thin film for gas sensing was tested by detection of NO2. The results showed high response, and selectivity towards NO2. The response was about 90% to 50 ppm NO2 at room temperature, which was 5.5 and 3.2 times higher than that of the gold layer loaded SnO2, and pristine SnO2 sensors, respectively.

AB Highly dispersed Rh particles supported on Ce0.75Zr0.25O2-delta mixed with alumina were prepared by sorption-hydrolytic deposition technique. Produced catalyst exhibited high activity in autothermal reforming of n-hexadecane, but suffered from coking. Structured Rh/Ce0.75Zr0.25O2-delta-eta-Al2O3/FeCrAl catalyst was prepared by strongly bound catalytic coating deposition onto metallic wire mesh to provide effective heat transfer and avoid coking. Rh/Ce0.75Zr0.25O2-delta-eta-Al2O3/FeCrAl showed excellent performance in n-hexadecane autothermal reforming providing 100% conversion and stable operation for at least 12 h on stream without detection of any carbon deposits.

AB Amorphous tungsten indium zinc oxide thin film transistors (WIZO TFTs) have been prepared using radio-frequency (RF) magnetron co-sputtering system to co-sputter indium zinc oxide (IZO) and indium tungsten oxide (IWO) targets. The electrical performance parameters and positive biased stress (PBS) test of the co-sputtered WIZO TFT were investigated to obtain better characteristics with regards to the IZO and IWO TFT counterparts. The co-sputtered TFT displayed high electrical performance (field effect mobility, mu(FE) similar to 22.30 cm(2)/Vs, and sub-threshold swing, SS similar to 0.36 V/decade) and stable electrical behavior (PBS value shift, Delta V-th similar to 1.23 V) than the IZO (mu(FE) similar to 19.90 cm(2)/Vs, SS similar to 0.46 V/decade, Delta V-th similar to 7.79 V) and IWO (conducting in nature) TFTs for its application in flexible and transparent displays.

AB Feature engineering is fundamental in applied machine learning. It plays a major role in writer identification of handwritten documents, which has been an active area of research in the literature. In this paper, we propose a conceptually simple, yet high-quality and computationally efficient descriptor referred to as block wise local binary count (BW-LBC) for offline text independent writer identification of handwritten documents. The proposed BW-LBC operator characterizes the writing style of each writer by a set of histograms calculated from all the connected components in the writing. Each histogram is constructed by calculating the occurrence distribution of pixels corresponding to the writing within small blocks in each connected component extracted and cropped from the input handwriting sample (document or set of words/text lines). Specifically, for a given connected component divided into N x N non-overlapping blocks, the appearance probability of writing pixels in the block number i corresponds to the histogram bin number i in the produced corresponding histogram of N x N bins. The samples are classified according to their normalized histogram feature vectors through the nearest-neighbor rule (1-NN) using the Hamming distance. Extensive experiments performed on four challenging handwritten databases (IFN/ENIT, AHTID/MW, CVL and IAM) containing handwritten texts in Arabic and English languages, show that the proposed system using the BW-LBC operator demonstrates superior performance on the Arabic databases (i.e., AHTID/MW and IFN/ENIT) and competitive performance on the English scripts compared to the old and recent state-of-the-art writer identification approaches.

AB This paper proposes a methodology to detect candlestick patterns in a stock trading system using fuzzy logic. The fuzzy approach make possible to account for the vagueness and uncertainty of the pattern features. Even more, the use of fuzzy rules allows it to include that uncertainty into a trading decision system that not only advises the investor on when but also on how much capital to invest. In this way, the intelligent system helps the experts to use their knowledge, i.e. the candlestick-based rules, in a more natural and realistic way than the standard one based on crisp rules. In the paper we have illustrated this methodology with the generation of a fuzzy trading system that uses three well-known candlestick patterns that have been fuzzified. The performance of this intelligent stock trading system is tested in two portfolios of different stock markets, Nasdaq-100 and Eurostoxx, and it is compared against its crisp counterpart and the classical Buy-and-Hold trading strategy. Our fuzzy candlestick-based trading system not only improves the pattern recognition with respect to its crisp version, but it also provides promising results since it exhibits a more stable behavior in the markets analyzed, and obtains more profits in a less risky way than the other trading systems considered.

AB In this paper, we study the unrelated parallel machine scheduling problem with one scarce additional resource to minimise the maximum completion time of the jobs or makespan. Several heuristics are proposed following two strategies: the first one is based on the consideration of the resource constraint during the whole solution construction process. The second one starts from several assignment rules without considering the resource constraint, and repairs the non feasible assignments in order to obtain a feasible solution. Several computation experiments are carried out over an extensive benchmark. A comparative evaluation against previously proposed mathematical models and matheuristics (combination of mathematical models and heuristics) is carried out. From the results, we can conclude that our methods outperform the existing ones, and the second strategy performs better, especially for large instances. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID MONTE-CARLO METHODS
AB Based on the binding constraint indices of the optimal solution to the linear programming (LP) model, a feasible system of linear equations can be formed. Because an interval linear programming (ILP) model is the union of numerous LP models, an interval linear equations system (ILES) can be formed, which is the union of these conventional systems. Hence, a new algorithm is introduced in which an arbitrary characteristic model of the ILP model is chosen and solved. The set of indices of its binding constraints is then obtained. This set is used to form and solve an ILES using the enclosure method. If all the components of the interval solutions to this system are strictly non-negative, the optimal solution set (OSS) of the ILP model is determined as the subscription of the zone created by reversing the signs of the binding constraints of the worst model and the binding constraints of the best model. The solutions to several problems obtained by the new algorithm and a Monte Carlo simulation are compared. The proposed algorithm is applicable to large-scale problems. To this end, an ILP model with 270 constraints and 270 variables is solved. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Many transportation systems for routing flows between several origin-destination pairs of demand nodes have been widely designed as hub-and-spoke networks. To improve the provided service level of these networks, service time requirements are here considered during modeling, giving rise to a multiple allocation incomplete hub location problem with service time requirements. The problem consists of designing a hub and spoke network by locating hubs, establishing inter-hub arcs, and routing origin-destination demand flows at minimal cost while meeting some service time requirements. As travel times are usually uncertain for most real cases, the problem is approached via a binary linear programming robust optimization model, which is solved by two specialized Benders decomposition algorithms. The devised Benders decomposition framework outperforms a general purpose optimization solver on solving benchmark instances of the hub location literature. The achieved results also show how the probability of violating the travel time requirements decreases with the prescribed protection level, at the expense of the higher costs of the optimal solution for the robust optimization model.

AB Real-time production monitoring in oil and gas industry has become very significant particularly as fields become economically marginal and reservoirs deplete. Virtual flow meters (VFMs) are intelligent systems that infer multiphase flow rates from ancillary measurements and are attractive and cost-effective solutions to meet monitoring demands, reduce operational costs, and improve oil recovery efficiency. Current VFMs are very challenging to develop and very expensive to maintain, most of which were developed for wells with dedicated physical meters where there exists an abundance of well test data. This study proposes a VFM system based on ensemble learning for fields with common metering infrastructure where data generated is very limited. The proposed method generates diverse neural network (NN) learners by manipulating training data, NN architecture and learning trajectory. Adaptive simulated annealing optimization is proposed to select the best subset of learners and the optimal combining strategy. The proposed method was evaluated using actual well test data and managed to achieve a remarkable performance with average errors of 4.7% and 2.4% for liquid and gas flow rates respectively. The accuracy of the developed VFM was also analyzed using cumulative deviation plot where the predictions are within a maximum deviation of +/- 15%. Furthermore, the proposed ensemble method was compared to standard bagging and stacking and remarkable improvements have been observed in both accuracy and ensemble size. The proposed VFM is expected to be easier to develop and maintain than model-driven VFMs since only well test samples are required to tune the model. It is hoped that the developed VFM can augment and backup physical meters, improve data reconciliation, and assist in reservoir management and flow assurance ultimately leading to a more efficient oil recovery and less operating and maintenance costs.

AB Supply chain event management exploits synergies between IT and logistics and refers to the set of methods and technologies used to efficiently integrate events from all actors and processes of the supply chain. In the context of supply chain event management, we examine how events can be used to leverage situation awareness. In our approach, situation awareness is facilitated by providing the capability to detect situations, which are represented as correlations between simple events, complex events and supply chain objects (e.g., suppliers, 3PL companies, retailers and material resources). We introduce a two-phase event correlation method which first correlates simple events into complex events and then events with supply chain objects. We describe how the proposed model has been implemented in a software framework and we conduct evaluation tests to examine its situation detection capabilities. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB This paper presents new feature selection algorithms for aggregate data analysis. Data aggregation is commonly used when it is not appropriate to model the relationship between a response and explanatory variables at an individual-level. We investigate substantial challenges in analysis for aggregate data. Then, we propose a groupwise feature selection method that addresses (i) the change in dataset depending on the selection of predictor variables, (ii) the presence of potential missing responses, and (iii) the suitability of model selection criteria when comparing models using different datasets. In application to real auto insurance data, we find a set of important predictors to classify the policyholders into some homogeneous risk groups. Our results clearly demonstrate the potential of the proposed feature selection method for aggregate data analysis in terms of flexibility and computational complexity. We expect that the proposed algorithms would be further applied into a wide range of decision-making tasks using aggregate data as they are applicable to any type of data. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

ID HIGH-DIMENSIONAL DATA
AB Dimensionality reduction becomes a significant problem due to the proliferation of high dimensional data. Sparse preserving projection (SPP) obtains the intrinsic geometric structure of the data, which contains natural discriminating information, and avoids the selection of parameters as well. However, SPP neglects the global structures since it computes the sparse representation of each data individually. Low rank representation (LRR), another commonly used dimensionality reduction method, finds the lowest rank representation of all data jointly, and is capable of capturing the global structures of data. Therefore in this paper, we propose a method, global and intrinsic geometric structure embedding for unsupervised feature selection (GGEFS), by constructing a low-rank-sparse graph. Our GGEFS method contains the loss of information, the preservation of structural information and the sparse regularization, of projection matrix, on which we impose l(2,1/2)-matrix norm to select sparser and discriminative features. An effective iterative algorithm based on Lagrange Multiplier method is described to solve GGEFS. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperform several state-of-the-art unsupervised feature selection methods. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB There is currently no standard or widely accepted subset of features to effectively classify different emotions based on electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. While combining all possible EEG features may improve the classification performance, it can lead to high dimensionality and worse performance due to redundancy and inefficiency. To solve the high-dimensionality problem, this paper proposes a new framework to automatically search for the optimal subset of EEG features using evolutionary computation (EC) algorithms. The proposed framework has been extensively evaluated using two public datasets (MAHNOB, DEAP) and a new dataset acquired with a mobile EEG sensor. The results confirm that EC algorithms can effectively support feature selection to identify the best EEG features and the best channels to maximize performance over a four-quadrant emotion classification problem. These findings are significant for informing future development of EEG-based emotion classification because low-cost mobile EEG sensors with fewer electrodes are becoming popular for many new applications.

AB The use of Bayesian Networks allows to organize and correlate information gathered from different sources and its optimization may incorporate restrictions adjusting the network based on expert knowledge and network operativeness, in such a way that it may satisfactorily represent a given domain. The main goal of this paper is to study if an optimized learned Bayesian Network may be used as a prior structure for an expert based network of an engineering structural material analysis. The methodology is applied to a database of results from an experimental campaign that focused on the mechanical characterization of timber elements recovered from an early 20th century building. To that study case it is evidenced that through a suitable combination of model averaging and supervision steps it is possible to achieve robust and reliable models to underpin the causal structure of a typical multi-scale timber analysis.

ID MODELS; PATTERNS; CONTEXT
AB Trajectory classification techniques face various challenges due to varying length and lack of the presence of clear boundaries among the trajectory classes. To overcome such challenges, a trajectory shrinking framework using Adaptive Multi-Kernel based Shrinkage (AMKS) can be used. However, such a strategy often results in over-shrinking of trajectories leading to poor classification. To improve classification performance, we introduce two additional kernels that are based on convex hull and Ramer-Douglas-Peucker (RDP) algorithm. Next, we propose a supervised trajectory classification approach using a combination of global and Segmental Hidden Markov Model (HMM) based classifiers. In the first stage, HMM is used globally for classification of trajectory to provide state-wise distribution of trajectory segments. In the second stage, state-wise trajectory segments are classified and combined with global recognition performance to improve the classification results. Combination of Global HMM and Segmental HMM is performed using a genetic algorithm (GA) based framework in the final stage. We have conducted experiments over two publicly available datasets, popularly known as T15 and MIT. We have achieved 94.80% and 96.75% of accuracies on T15 and MIT datasets, respectively. We also analyzed the robustness of the proposed framework by adding Gaussian noise. To show the effectiveness of the system, we have performed recognition of on-line signature using proposed Segmental HMM based combination model. In SVC2004 signature dataset, it outperforms traditional HMM-based systems. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In recent years, credit scoring has become an efficient tool that allows financial institutions to differentiate their potential default borrowers. Accordingly, researchers have developed a myriad of approaches, including statistical and artificial intelligence techniques, to fulfill the task of credit scoring. Recent studies have shown that ensemble methods, which combine multiple algorithms that process different hypotheses to form a new hypothesis, generally outperform the other credit scoring approaches. In this paper, we propose a novel heterogeneous ensemble credit model that integrates the bagging algorithm with the stacking method. The proposed model differs from the extant ensemble credit models in three aspects, namely, pool generation, selection of base learners, and trainable fuser. Four popular evaluation metrics, including accuracy, area under the curve (AUC), AUC-H measure, and Brier score, are employed to measure the performance of alternative models. To confirm the efficiency of the proposed bstacking approach, a wide range of models, including individual classifiers, homogeneous ensemble model, and heterogeneous ensemble model, are introduced as benchmarks. We also provided a discussion on the accurate yet complex credit scoring model (e.g., bstacking) from a regulatory perspective. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Due to the rapid extension of social networks in recent years, a new potential has emerged for global spreading of messages and effective broadcasting of news. Identification of influential nodes within a network is now seen as a key factor for bringing this potential into action. k-shell is a measure for detection of node influence, and has already been used in some successful algorithms in this field. However, k-shell does not provide enough information about the topological positions of the nodes, and the present paper seeks to present a special hierarchical measure for dealing with this issue. Along with introduction of the above measure, it is shown that it can be used for detecting and ranking node influence. The experiments done on real-world and artificial networks demonstrate that the proposed approach can rank the influence of nodes more accurately than other approaches. (c) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB This paper introduces a novel proposal to discover the best associative classification rules through studying the influence of the attributes used in robust catalogues. Notice that a catalogue is defined as a dataset free of duplicate records. Moreover, a robust catalogue is obtained when incomplete records and those with uncertainty are eliminated from a catalogue. Therefore, a robust catalogue is a collection of association rules with 100% confidence and unitary support. In this paper we demonstrate that robust catalogues contain the same association rules as the datasets from which they were obtained, but can be managed in memory without eliminating any data from the analysis. In fact, the experiments performed show that all robust catalogues contained in a classification dataset are easily obtained, providing millions of associative classification rules with 100% confidence to the expert researcher in data mining.

AB Classification of evolving data streams is a challenging task, which is suitably tackled with online learning approaches. Data is processed instantly requiring the learning machinery to (self-)adapt by adjusting its model. However for high velocity streams, it is usually difficult to obtain labeled samples to train the classification model. Hence, we propose a novel online batch-based active learning algorithm (OBAL) to perform the labeling. OBAL is developed for crisis management applications where data streams are generated by the social media community. OBAL is applied to discriminate relevant from irrelevant social media items. An emergency management user will be interactively queried to label chosen items. OBAL exploits the boundary items for which it is highly uncertain about their class and makes use of two classifiers: k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN) and Support Vector Machine (SVM). OBAL is equipped with a labeling budget and a set of uncertainty strategies to identify the items for labeling. An extensive analysis is carried out to show OBAL's performance, the sensitivity of its parameters, and the contribution of the individual uncertainty strategies. Two types of datasets are used: synthetic and social media datasets related to crises. The empirical results illustrate that OBAL has a very good discrimination power. (c) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB In this paper, a novel method is proposed to support the process of solving multi-objective nonlinear programming problems subject to strict or flexible constraints. This method assumes that the practical problems are expressed in the form of geometric programming problems. Integrating the concept of intuitionistic fuzzy sets into the solving procedure, a rich structure is provided which can include the inevitable uncertainties into the model regarding different objectives and constraints. Another important feature of the proposed method is that it continuously interacts with the decision maker. Thus, the decision maker could learn about the problem, thereby a compromise solution satisfying his/hers preferences could be obtained. Further, a new two-step geometric programming approach is introduced to determine Pareto-optimal compromise solutions for the problems defined during different iterative steps. Employing the compensatory operator of "weighted geometric mean", the first step concentrates on finding an intuitionistic fuzzy efficient compromise solution. In the cases where one or more intuitionistic fuzzy objectives are fully achieved, a second geometric programming model is developed to improve the resulting compromise solution. Otherwise, it is concluded that the resulting solution vectors simultaneously satisfy both of the conditions of intuitionistic fuzzy efficiency and Pareto-optimality. The models forming the proposed solving method are developed in a way such that, the posynomiality of the defined problem is not affected. This property is of great importance when solving nonlinear programming problems. A numerical example of multi-objective nonlinear programming problem is also used to provide a better understanding of the proposed solving method. (c) 2017 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Gender classification in smartphones has a lot of potential applications. Specifically, the gender information can be used by expert and intelligent systems that are part of healthcare, smart spaces and biometric-based access control applications. For example, operations of intelligent systems in a smart space can be customized based on gender information to provide an enhanced user experience. Similarly, a biometric system can use gender as a soft biometric trait to improve its user authentication performance. This paper presents an approach for gender classification using users' gait information captured using the built-in sensors of a smartphone. Histogram of gradient (HG) method is proposed to extract features from the gait data, which includes a set of signals collected from accelerometer and gyroscope sensors of a smartphone. The bootstrap aggregating classifier utilizes the discriminatory information in these features for classification of the gender. The performance of the proposed approach has been evaluated on datasets collected using two different smartphones. These datasets contain a total of 654 gait data from 109 subjects. Our experimental results show that the classification accuracy of the proposed approach is higher than that of the existing methods. Additional experiments performed to examine the effect of variations in walking speed indicate that these variations have a minimal impact on the performance of proposed approach. Furthermore, results from our experiments performed on the gait data collected using two different smartphones suggest that the performance of the proposed algorithm for gender recognition is consistent across the two datasets, achieving classification accuracies of 91.78%, 94.44% and 88.89% on the first dataset and 90.48%, 91.07% and 88.46% on the second dataset for normal, fast and slow walking speeds, respectively. The results of this study are significant as they indicate that gait information captured by the smartphones' built-in sensors can be used to derive gender information reliably and unobtrusively.

AB This paper proposes a robust structure identification method (RSIM) based on incremental partitioning learning. RSIM starts with an open region (initial domain) that covers all input samples. The initial region starts with one fuzzy rule without fuzzy terms and then evolves through incremental partitioning learning, which creates many subregions for system error minimization. The three major contributions of the proposed RSIM are as follows: It locates sufficient splitting points provided through a robust partitioning technique, determines the optimum trade-off between accuracy and complexity through a novel partition-selection technique, minimizes global error through global least square optimization. These contributions offer many remarkable advantages. First, RSIM provides a solution for the curse of dimensionality. Second, RSIM can also be applied to low-dimensional problems. Third, RSIM seeks to produce few rules with low number of conditions to improve system readability. Fourth, RSIM minimizes the number of fired rules. Therefore, RSIM can achieve low-level complexity systems. Three low-dimension and six high-dimension and real-life benchmarks are used to evaluate the performance of RSIM with state-of the art methods. Although RSIM has high interpretability, the results prove that RSIM exhibits greater accuracy than other existing methods. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Events prediction in a sequence of events is a challenging task that can be approached with data mining. In this paper, we focus on the specific case of early prediction of distant events. We aim at mining episode rules with a consequent temporally distant from the antecedent and an antecedent as small as possible both in number of events and in occurrence duration. We refer to these rules as essential rules. To reach this goal, we propose an original algorithm, DEER: Distant and Essential Episode Rules. This algorithm differs from traditional algorithms in three points. First, it determines the consequent of episode rules at an early stage in the mining process, which allows to mine rules with an antecedent as small as possible. Second, it applies a minimal gap constraint between the antecedent and the consequent to guarantee a suitable distance between both elements. Third, the stop criterion used considers both the support and the confidence of the rules, at the opposite of traditional algorithms that use only the support.
   Experiments on both synthetic and real datasets show that DEER runs faster than several algorithms of the state-of-the-art and has also good scalability on large datasets. Furthermore, by studying in details the episode rules mined from a real dataset of blog messages, we demonstrate not only the efficiency of our algorithm for mining interesting essential rules with a distant consequent, but also that these rules can be used to accurately predict distant events.

AB Regression models and analysis of variance are widely used methods for analyzing manufacturing processes in the industry. Its objective is to analyze the effect of process input variables on a final quality characteristic. However, some processes have complex data that cannot be described by linear regression or have several product quality characteristics to be controlled, having several correlated responses makes it difficult to analyze and optimize the process, thus, it is common to ignore the correlation between responses and make several independent models for each response, causing problems for decision-making based on these models. This paper shows the application of multivariate statistical analysis in a Radial Basis Function neural network, considering the statistical significance between independent and dependent variables and the correlation and verifying if the assumptions for this analysis are fulfilled. The results evidence that the multivariate statistical analysis in the Radial Basis Function is a good method to analyze the process based on correlated variables: it satisfies the assumptions required for this analysis, it determines the process variation, and it also determines the most important variable that had influence in the process used to evaluate the permanent mold casting process.

AB Many intelligent systems, such as assistive robots, augmented reality trainers or unmanned vehicles, need to know their physical location in the environment in order to fulfill their task. While relying exclusively on natural landmarks for that task is the preferred option, their use is somewhat limited because the proposed methods are complex, require high computational power, and are not reliable in all environments. On the other hand, artificial landmarks can be placed in order to alleviate these problems. In particular, square fiducial markers are one of the most popular tools for camera pose estimation due to their high performance and precision. However, the state-of-the-art methods still perform poorly under difficult image conditions, such as camera defocus, motion blur, small scale or non-uniform lighting.
   This paper proposes a method to robustly detect this type of landmarks under challenging image conditions present in realistic scenarios. To do so, we re-define the marker identification problem as a classification one based on state-of-the-art machine learning techniques. Second, we propose a procedure to create a training dataset of synthetically generated images affected by several challenging transformations. Third, we show that, in this problem, a classifier can be trained using exclusively synthetic data, performing well in real and challenging conditions. Different types of classifiers have been tested to prove the validity of our proposal (namely, Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Support Vector Machine (SVM)), and statistical analyses have been performed in order to determine the best approach for our problem. Finally, the obtained classifiers have been compared to the ArUco and AprilTags fiducial marker systems in challenging video sequences. The results obtained show that the proposed method performs significantly better than previous approaches, making the use of this technology more reliable in a wider range of realistic scenarios such as outdoor scenes or fast moving cameras.

ID FRAMEWORK; ALGORITHM
AB This work addresses classification of unknown binaries executed in sandbox by modeling their interaction with system resources (files, mutexes, registry keys and communication with servers over the network) and error messages provided by the operating system, using vocabulary-based method from the multiple instance learning paradigm. It introduces similarities suitable for individual resource types that combined with an approximative clustering method efficiently group the system resources and define features directly from data. This approach effectively removes randomization often employed by malware authors and projects samples into low-dimensional feature space suitable for common classifiers. An extensive comparison to the state of the art on a large corpus of binaries demonstrates that the proposed solution achieves superior results using only a fraction of training samples. Moreover, it makes use of a source of information different than most of the prior art, which increases the diversity of tools detecting the malware, hence making detection evasion more difficult.

AB Carotid artery stenosis is generally a constriction caused by atherosclerosis or carotid artery lumen bottleneck. Carotid arteries are located closely to bones and osteoid structures. Osteoid structures and carotid arteries are frequently confused with each other when performing vessel evaluations. This study provides a novel method for carotid artery lumen segmentation on CTA images by using automatic vessel segmentation with inverse approach, in which vessel segmentation is performed after bone region is segmented and eliminated. The region growing and random walk segmentation methods are utilized in the elimination of bone region and the vessel segmentation. The seed points in the mentioned methods are not manually determined by any starting point. In automatic segmentation, seeds are selected from the experimentally determined intervals according to the local histogram. The stages of preprocessing and post-processing are utilized for better segmentation. The tracking of vessel centers based on continuity is employed for 3D reconstruction and 3D imaging of the vessels. Experiments were conducted with different data sets including various CTA images by using the mentioned methods. As a result, dice similarity rate above 92% was achieved together with 0.16 mm Msd and 99% accuracy. It was concluded based on these results that the proposed method provides successful results in different points of common, internal, external, vertebral arteries, carotid bifurcation and locales close to osteoid structures which are deemed challenging regions for carotid artery lumen segmentation.

ID FEATURE-SELECTION; OPTIMIZATION; DESIGN; CHAOS
AB In this research, we propose a variant of the firefly algorithm (FA) for classifier ensemble reduction. It incorporates both accelerated attractiveness and evading strategies to overcome the premature convergence problem cif the original FA model. The attractiveness strategy takes not only the neighboring but also global best solutions into account, in order to guide the firefly swarm to reach the optimal regions with fast convergence while the evading action employs both neighboring and global worst solutions to drive the search out of gloomy regions. The proposed algorithm is subsequently used to conduct discriminant base classifier selection for generating optimized ensemble classifiers without compromising classification accuracy. Evaluated with standard, shifted, and composite test functions, as well as the Black-Box Optimization Benchmarking test suite and several high dimensional UCI data sets, the empirical results indicate that, based on statistical tests, the proposed FA model outperforms other state-of-the-art FA variants and classical metaheuristic search methods in solving diverse complex unimodal and multimodal optimization and ensemble reduction problems. Moreover, the resulting ensemble classifiers show superior performance in comparison with those of the original, full-sized ensemble models. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The main objective of this paper is to propose the family of hybrid novel interval type-2 fractional order fuzzy PID (IT2FO-FPID) controllers, which incorporates fractional order integro-differentiator, taking into its consideration the advantages of the interval type-2 fuzzy controllers (IT2FLCs) and fractional order PID (FOPID) controllers. The incorporation of IT2FLCs with FOPID controllers has been investigated in terms of time response measure for unit set-point response and unit load disturbance. The resulting different hybrid IT2FO-FPID controller structures are examined on different fractional order processes followed by robustness analysis. It is observed that incorporation of fractional order integro-differential operators made the proposed control structures less sensitive to the parameters change. For this reason, fractional order integro-differential operators are adopted as design variables along with input/output scaling factors for designing of effective novel controllers. In order to do reasonable comparison, the tuning of the family of hybrid IT2FO-FPID controllers' parameters is done with newly Artificial Bee Colony-Genetic Algorithm (ABC-GA) optimization technique to develop optimal closed loop performance by considering the objective function as weighted sum of control loop error index and control output. The simulation analyses are executed for two different non-integer order plus time delay fractional order process plants (NIOPTD-I and NIOPTD-II). These processes represent a sensible estimation of most process plants and are employed to examine the comparative qualities of the presented hybrid IT2FO-FPID controllers. Further, the performance comparison and the significance of the different proposed hybrid controllers are investigated under unit set-point response, load disturbance rejection, and small control signal or actuators requirement. In order to test the efficacy of proposed controllers, the robustness analysis such as parameter variations is also investigated. Finally, the simulation investigations explicitly suggest that proposed different hybrid IT2FO-FPID control structures can be recommended in terms of better step response, better load disturbance rejection, small control signal response, and parameters variation.

AB The dramatic increase of observational data across industries provides unparalleled opportunities for data-driven decision making and management, including the manufacturing industry. In the context of production, data-driven approaches can exploit observational data to model, control and improve process performance. When supplied by observational data with adequate coverage to inform the true process performance dynamics, they can overcome the cost associated with intrusive controlled designed experiments and can be applied for both process monitoring and improvement. We propose a novel integrated approach that uses observational data for identifying significant control variables while simultaneously facilitating process parameter design. We evaluate our method using data from synthetic experiments and also apply it to a real-world case setting from a tire manufacturing company. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In this paper, we investigate Co-location Pattern Mining (CPM) from big spatial datasets. CPM consists in searching for types of objects that are frequently located together in a spatial neighborhood. Knowledge about such patterns is very important in fields like biology, environmental sciences, epidemiology etc. However, CPM is computationally challenging, mainly due to the large number of pattern instances hidden in spatial data. In this work, we propose a new solution that can utilize the power of multiple GPUs to increase the performance of CPM. The proposed solution is also capable of coping with the GPU memory limits by dividing the work into multiple packages and compressing internal data structures. Experiments performed on large synthetic and real-world datasets prove that we can achieve an order of magnitude speedups in comparison to the efficient multithreaded CPU implementation. Our solution can greatly improve the performance of data analysis, using widely available and energy efficient graphics cards. As a result, CPM in large datasets is more viable for university researchers as well as smaller companies and organizations. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The objective of this paper is to investigate the potential affecting mechanisms of L-lysine (Lys)/ L-arginine (Arg) on myosin solubility. The results showed that both Lys and Arg increased the solubility of myosin at the examined pH values. Additionally, both Lys and Arg decreased the hydrodynamic size of myosin but increased the hydration capacity (HC), the surface aromatic hydrophobicity of myosin, the surface tension of the myosin solution and the absolute transfer free energy (TFE) of the major amino acids that constitute myosin. The results indicate that the properties of Lys or Arg that result in an inhibition of myosin aggregation and an interaction with hydrophobic amino acid residues may play important roles in increasing the myosin solubility. The results are attractive to the meat industry.

AB The objective of this study was evaluate the effects of moisture and temperature during grain storage on the functional properties and isoflavone profile of soy protein concentrate. The protein concentrate was extracted from soybeans on the first day of storage and after 12 months of storage, at 12 and 15% moisture and at temperatures of 11, 18, 25, and 32 degrees C. The protein concentrate obtained from grains stored at 32 degrees C showed decreased extraction yield (51.6% with 15% of moisture) and protein solubility (24.8% with 15% of moisture) with increased emulsifying capacity (52.2% with 12% of moisture) and foam formation, compared with sample obtained at the start of the storage period. The isoflavone profile showed a decrease in the concentrations of glycosylated, malonyl, and acetyl isoflavones and a corresponding increase in the concentrations of aglycone isoflavones, with the magnitude of these changes increasing with increasing storage temperature and moisture content.

AB Gluten proteins functionality during pastry production was examined by including redox agents in the ingredient bill. Addition of reducing and oxidizing agents respectively increased and decreased dough height during fermentation. The presence of large gas bubbles in the samples with oxidizing agents may have caused a 'stacking'effect and a more effective dough lift. During baking, the level of extractable proteins decreased to comparable values for all samples, except when potassium iodate (KIO3) was used in the recipe. As a result of its use, a lower level of gliadin was incorporated into the gluten polymer and dough layers tended to 'slide' apart during baking, thereby causing collapse. Most likely, KIO3 caused glutenin oxidation within each individual dough layer to such extent during the dough stage that insufficient thiol groups were available for forming dough layer interconnections during baking, after margarine melting. Furthermore, addition of redox agents impacted the product's crumb structure.

AB The role of grape seed tannins on improving organoleptic properties and its involvement in color stabilization in red wine are well established. The addition of grape seeds as the source of condensed tannins in fruit wine may provide a solution for its color instability and improvement of sensory attributes. Syzgium cumini is traditionally known for its therapeutic properties. In the current study, the influence of yeasts and grape seed addition during fermentation on the chromatic, phenolic and sensory attributes of the wine was accessed. Grape seed addition improved the color characteristics of wine and increased overall phenolic composition. Analysis by HPLC revealed 6 major anthocyanins, among which 3, 5-diglucoside form of delphidin and petunidin was found to be the major components. Cluster and PLSR analysis explained the impact of seed addition on the yeasts, as well as on the perception of panelists, with bitterness and astringency as the dominating attributes.

AB Unit chain length distributions of amylopectin and its phi, beta-limit dextrins, which reflect amylopectin internal structure from three maca starches, were determined by high-performance anion-exchange chromatography with pulsed amperometric detection after debranching, and the samples were compared with maize starch. The amylopectins exhibited average chain lengths ranging from 16.72 to 17.16, with ranges of total internal chain length, external chain length, and internal chain length of the maca amylopectins at 12.49 to 13.68, 11.24 to 11.89, and 4.27 to 4.48. The average chain length, external chain length, internal chain length, and total internal chain length were comparable in three maca amylopectins. Amylopectins of the three maca genotypes studied here presented no significant differences in their unit chain length profiles, but did show significant differences in their internal chain profiles. Additional genetic variations between different maca genotypes need to be studied to provide unit-and internal chain profiles of maca amylopectin.

AB Concerns regarding increased dietary oil uptake have prompted efforts to investigate the oil absorption and distribution in fried starchy foods. In the present study, attenuated total reflection Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy, together with a chloroform-methanol method, was used to analyze the external and internal oil contents in fried starchy samples. The micromorphology of fried starchy samples was further investigated using scanning electron microscope (SEM), polarized light microscope (PLM) and confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM). The results indicated that large amounts of oil were absorbed in or within waxy maize starch, but the majority of oil was located near the surface layer of the starch granules. After defatting, the internal oil was thoroughly removed, while a small amount of external oil remained. As evidenced by the changes of the crystalline characteristics with the help of X-ray diffraction (XRD), the interaction between starch and lipids on the surface was confirmed to form V-type complex compounds during frying at high moisture.

AB There is no information on the chemical composition of camelina seed lecithin; therefore, the objective of this study was to investigate the chemical composition and emulsifying properties of lecithin recovered from camelina seed oil by water (WDCL) and enzymatic degumming (EDCL) using phospholipase A(1) (PLA(1)). The lecithin obtained by both WDLC and EDLC was rich in phosphatidylinositol (PI), and contents were 37.8 and 25.2 wt%, respectively. Lecithin recovered by enzymatic degumming contained more lysophospholipids compared to water degumming. The saturated fatty acid content of the EDCL was significantly higher than that of the WDCL. Emulsions stabilized using EDCL resulted in the highest stability when deionized water was used as the aqueous phase (original pH); however, at pH = 7.5, emulsions stabilized using EDCL and WDCL were less stable compared to the emulsion stabilized with soy lecithin. Results showed that camelina seed lecithin is a promising alternative PI-rich emulsifier for various food applications.

AB This is the first study to investigate the extent of reduction in acrylamide formation during baking with the addition of (-)- epigallocatechin gallate ( EGCG) extracted from green tea, and to determine whether EGCG influences the texture and colour attributes of bread, or interacts with other ingredients. EGCG powders were added to white bread formulations at the concentrations of 3.3, 6.6 and 9.9 g.kg(-1). The amount of acrylamide in the bread was analysed using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. EGCG addition significantly reduced the acrylamide formation by 37% compared to the control and decreased the moisture content of the bread by 6%. It did not affect its texture attribute, but increased the lightness and the yellowness and decreased the redness of bread crust (with contrasting results in crumb). It also decreased granule size and porosity. In conclusion, EGCG fortification is a feasible method to decrease acrylamide formation in baked bread.

AB Pyrodextrins were prepared by heating waxy maize starch at 170 degrees C and pH 3.0 for 0.5, 1, 2, 3 and 4 h. Structural changes of pyrodextrins were determined by gel permeation chromatography and H-1 NMR. Gelatinization and retrogradation of pyrodextrins were measured by differential scanning calorimetry. The water solubility of pyrodextrins increased from 48.9 to 99.4% as heating time increased from 0.5 to 4 h. The molecular size, melting enthalpy of pyrodextrin, and the degree of retrogradation decreased as pyrodextrin solubility increased. The level of 1,6-anhydro-beta-D-glucopyranose increased from 2.6 to 4.0% as the heating time increased from 0.5 to 4 h. The degree of branching (DB) of pyrodextrins was increased from 8.8 to 14.4%, and the average chain length (CL) reduced from 7.2 to 4.6. The increased level of new bonds and DB combined with reduced CL during the dextrinization explained the reduced extent of retrogradation of the pyrodextrin.

Among them, 10 and 11 were found to possess the strongest inhibitory effect on monophenolase activity of mushroom tyrosinase, having IC50 values of 2.04 and 1.60 mu M, respectively. The IC50 values of 10 and 11 for the inhibition of diphenolase activity of mushroom tyrosinase were determined as 13.89 and 7.99 mu M, respectively. Investigation of the inhibitory mechanism of these two compounds indicated that the inhibition was reversible and of a competitiveuncompetitive mixed type. The K-I and K-IS values of 10 were determined to be 24.84 and 32.54 mu M, respectively, and the corresponding values for 11 being 18.07 and 21.34 mu M, respectively. The effect of 11 on the browning process of fresh-cut apples was evaluated by measuring the color change and browning index. The results indicated that 11 had a significant effect on controlling the browning of fresh-cut apple slices.

AB Effects of extraction time and solvent polarity on antioxidant properties of Brassica oleracea leaves were optimized by response surface methodology using a central composite design. Five extraction times (12, 24, 36, 48 and 60 h) and solvent polarities (dipole moment -hexane: 0.0, diethyl ether: 2.80, ethyl acetate: 4.40, methanol: 5.10 and water: 9.0 D) were selected for optimization. Response surface analysis of data showed a significant increase (p < 0.05) in extract yield and antioxidant potential, based on total phenolic acids, reducing abilities and free radical scavenging capacities, in response to an increase in extraction time and solvent polarity. The optimal response was obtained using relatively polar solvents (4.40-9.00 D) and prolonged extraction times (50-60 h). This suggests that most of the phytochemical constituents of B. oleracea leaves are polar and possess strong antioxidant potential.

AB Methods were optimized for extraction and quantification of anthocyanins (ACY) and vitamin C in potatoes. Acidified aqueous methanol (70%) was the optimal extraction solvent and freeze-drying significantly improved the extraction yield of ACY. The content of ACY varied widely in five potato cultivars from 0.42 to 3.18 mg/g dry weight, with the latter being the highest value found in the Finnish cultivar 'SynkCA Sakari'.
   Compared with dithiothreitol (DTT), tris(2-carboxyethyl) phosphine hydrochloride (TCEP) was more efficient in reducing dehydroascorbic acid (DHA) to ascorbic acid (AA) and for quantifying the content of total ascorbic acid (TAA). For raw potatoes, quantification of TAA after treatment with TCEP was more reliable than a direct analysis of AA, whereas AA can be analyzed directly in steam-cooked samples. The TAA contents in the three potato cultivars were around 0.30-0.35 mg/g dry weight. The loss of AA in steam cooking was 24%.

AB The edible ink stain bolete (Cyanoboletus pulverulentus) was found to hyperaccumulate arsenic. We analyzed 39 individual collections determined as C. pulverulentus, mostly from the Czech Republic. According to our results, concentrations of arsenic in C. pulverulentus fruit-bodies may reach 1300 mg kg(-1) dry weight. In most collections, data for total and bioavailable arsenic in underlying soils were collected but no significant correlation between the soil arsenic content and arsenic concentrations in the associated fruit-bodies was found. Within the fruit-bodies, we found the majority of arsenic accumulated in the hymenium. Besides occasional traces of methylarsonic acid (MA), the arsenic speciation in all mushroom samples consisted solely of dimethylarsinic acid (DMA) and no inorganic arsenic was detected. Because of the carcinogenic potential of DMA, C. pulverulentus should not be recommended as an edible mushroom and its consumption should be restricted.

AB Guava is a typically tropical fruit highly perishable with a short shelf-life due to intense metabolic activity after harvested. In attempt to minimize the problems related to the postharvest, we evaluated the physiochemical characteristics and antioxidant system in guava fruits under chitosan coating at concentrations of 1%, 2%, and 3% stored at 25 degrees C during 96 h. The chitosan suppressed the respiratory rate, fresh weight loss, firmness and skin color with delay in the degradation of chlorophyll. In the treatment with 2% and 3% of chitosan in the solid soluble content and ascorbic acid were reduced; retarded the loss of titratable acidity during 96 h after treatment. These treatment induced significant decreases in the phenylalanine ammonia-lyase activity and significantly increases of peroxidase Activity. Our results suggest that chitosan effectively prolongs the quality attributes in guava fruits after harvesting due to increases in the antioxidant processes, delaying the ripening during room temperature of storage.

AB Microencapsulation was investigated to enhance the stability of Thai rice grass extract. Microencapsulated powder (MP) was formed using total solid of extract solution and maltodextrin ratios of 1: 4 (MP 1: 4) and 1: 9 (MP 1: 9). The absence of an endothermic peak for both MPs confirmed all extract solutions were coated with maltodextrin. MP 1: 9 had a lower total phenolic content (TPC) but was higher in antioxidant capacity than MP 1: 4. Moreover, the TPC of the MPs slightly decreased (70.02-93.04%) during storage at 10, 30 and 70 degrees C for 30 d. Comparatively, the TPC of the extract solution significantly decreased from 100% down to 20.8%, 11.2% and 8.6% at 10, 30 and 70 degrees C, respectively. Therefore, MP 1: 9 incorporated with blended carboxymethyl cellulose film increased the water barrier and the TPC. This film can serve as a bioactive biodegradable packaging material to reduce plastic packaging in the food industry.

AB The feasibility of the application of chemometric techniques associated with multi-element analysis for the classification of grape seeds according to their provenance vineyard soil was investigated. Grape seed samples from different localities of Mendoza province (Argentina) were evaluated. Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) was used for the determination of twenty-nine elements (Ag, As, Ce, Co, Cs, Cu, Eu, Fe, Ga, Gd, La, Lu, Mn, Mo, Nb, Nd, Ni, Pr, Rb, Sm, Te, Ti, Tl, Tm, U, V, Y, Zn and Zr). Once the analytical data were collected, supervised pattern recognition techniques such as linear discriminant analysis (LDA), partial least square discriminant analysis (PLS-DA), k-nearest neighbors (k-NN), support vector machine (SVM) and Random Forest (RF) were applied to construct classification/discrimination rules. The results indicated that nonlinear methods, RF and SVM, perform best with up to 98% and 93% accuracy rate, respectively, and therefore are excellent tools for classification of grapes.

AB A modelling approach was developed to better understand the behavior of the flatulence-causing oligosaccharides in cowpea seeds during isothermal water soaking-cooking process. Concentrations of verbascose, stachyose and raffinose were measured both in the seed and in the soaking water during the process (T = 30, 60 and 95 degrees C). A reaction-diffusion model was built for the three considered alpha-galactosides both in the seed and in the soaking water, together with a model of water transport in the seed. The model reproduced coupled reaction-diffusion of alpha-galactosides during the soaking-cooking process with a good fit. Produced, diffused and degraded alpha-galactoside fractions were identified by performing a mass balance. During soaking at 30 degrees C, degradation predominated (maximum found for raffinose degradation rate constant of 3.22 x10(-4) s(-1)) whereas diffusion predominated at higher temperatures (95 degrees C).

AB This study aims to assess the changes in beef aroma over time when steaks from pre-aged knuckles are stored in retail display under high oxygen conditions for 15 or 22 days in vacuum conditions. Odorous volatile compounds were analysed by solid-phase microextraction/gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Results were grouped as low, medium and high oxidative groups according to thiobarbituric acid reactive substances values after 9 days of display. The intensity of off-odours in the raw meat increased with ageing and display time and oxidative groups. Based on correlations between the variables and regressions of the compounds through display, eight compounds were proposed as odour shelf-life markers. Among them, five were most sensitive and precise in all oxidative groups: 1-hexanol in meat aged for 15 days, ethyl-octanoate and 2-pentylfuran in meat aged for 22 days, and pentanoic and hexanoic acids in the two studied ageing times.

AB Sterilised food products undergo chemical changes during processing that ultimately determine the product quality. To provide detailed information on the chemistry of each stage of a pet-food sterilisation process, a laboratory-scale system was developed, which allowed sampling under the high temperatures and pressures associated with sterilisation. Products from the laboratory-scale system were representative of the factory process. Sample extracts were analysed by Fourier Transform-Ion Cyclotron Resonance-Mass Spectrometry (FT-ICRMS), which delivered the molecular formulae and ion intensities of the compounds present. Data were examined to determine the coverage of this method, the degree of chemical change occurring during pet food thermal processing, and the level of identification possible with FT-ICR-MS. Data visualisation and statistical analysis identified significant chemical changes in pet food as a result of processing, and allowed tentative identification of the compounds involved. Insights generated using FT-ICR-MS analysis can be confirmed and further explored using conventional, targeted analyses.

AB The present study investigated the mechanism of epsilon-(gamma-glutamyl) lysine cross-links within hairtail (Trichiurus haumela) surimi protein via.-polyglutamic acid (gamma-PGA) and MTGase. The results indicated that the addition of MTGase and gamma-PGA markedly improved the gelation properties of hairtail surimi protein, including its maximum breaking force and deformation, water holding capacity and gel strength. The maximum improvements were achieved by adding 0.5 units MTGase/g meat paste in combination with 0.06% gamma-PGA. SDS-PAGE showed that the band intensity of cross-linked proteins increased, whereas that of myosin heavy chain decreased after treatments. Further scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis showed the formation of a denser gel matrix, which was caused by much stronger and more inter-and intra-molecular cross-linking of proteins, via MTGase catalysing epsilon-(gamma-glutamyl) lysine cross-links formed between lysine residues in the gel protein and glutamic residues in the hydrolytic gamma-PGA. The results provide reliable guidance for the improvement of hairtail surimi protein gelation properties.

AB In this study, a strategy based on chemical derivatization coupled with electrospray ionizationtandem quadru-pole mass spectrometry (ESI-MS/MS) for rapid and sensitive detection of FFAs in edible oils was developed. A derivative reagent (N, N-diethyl-1,2-ethanediamine, DEEA) was employed to selectively label carboxyl groups of FFAs to form an amino compound with a tertiary amino group. The DEEA derivative products could lose a characteristic neutral loss fragment of 73 Da in collision-induced dissociation (CID), which enabled to discriminate and analyze the DEEA derived FFAs with neutral loss scan (NLS 73 Da) under the positive ion mode of mass spectrometry. The assay was linear over the concentration range 0.5-200 nmol/L with satisfactory correlation coefficients (R-2 >= 0.9942), whilst the limit of detection and quantitation were 0.1-0.3 nmol/L and 0.3-1.0 nmol/L, respectively. Finally, the established method was applied to determine dynamic FFA formation in seven types of edible oils subjected to a microwave heating treatment test.

AB Hydroxytyrosol (HT) is a phenolic compound of recognized bioactivity that has been described in wines but little is known about its origin. This work demonstrates that yeast involved in wine making, i.e. Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains and the non-Saccharomyces Torulaspora delbrueckii, can synthesise HT, as this compound was identified in the intracellular media of three strains by means of a developed and validated UHPLC-HRMS method with LOQ and LOD of 0.108 and 0.035 ng mL(-1) respectively. Controlled fermentations were performed with different varieties of grapes (Corredera, Moscatel, Chardonnay, Palomino fino, Sauvignon Blanc, Vijiriega, and Tempranillo) and synthetic must. The Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain QA23 was the most efficient producer of HT from tested yeasts. On the other hand, the grape variety influences HT wine concentrations. Furthermore, the maximum concentration of HT is reached between the fourth and sixth day of fermentation. This work reveals that yeasts have a great potential for the production of HT.

AB Crushing is a key step during olive oil extraction. Among commercial crushers, the hammer mill is the most widely used due to its robustness and high throughput. In the present work, the impact of hammer mill rotor speed on extraction yield and overall quality of super-high-density Arbosana olive oils were assessed in an industrial facility. Our results show that increasing the rotor speed from 2400 rpm to 3600 rpm led to a rise in oil yield of 1.2%, while conserving quality parameters. Sensory analysis showed more pungency with increased rotation speed, while others attributes were unaffected. Volatile compounds showed little variation with the differences in crusher speed; however, total phenols content, two relevant secoiridoids, and triterpenoids levels increased with rotor speed. Hammer mill rotor speed is a processing variable that can be tuned to increase the extraction efficiency and modulate the chemical composition of extra virgin olive oil.

AB The objective was to compare the anti-proliferative effect of anthocyanin-rich plant extracts on human colon cancer cells and determine their mechanism of action. Eleven extracts were tested: red (RG) and purple grape, purple sweet potato, purple carrot, black and purple bean, black lentil (BL), black peanut, sorghum (SH), black rice, and blue wheat. HCT-116 and HT-29 inhibition correlated with total phenolics (r = 0.87 and 0.77, respectively), delphinidin-3-O-glucoside concentration with HT-29 inhibition (r = 0.69). The concentration inhibition fifty (IC50) for BL, SH, RG on HT-29 and HCT-116 cell proliferation ranged 0.9-2.0 mg/mL. Extracts decreased expression of anti-apoptotic proteins (survivin, cIAP-2, XIAP), induced apoptosis, and arrested cells in G1. Anthocyanins exhibited tyrosine kinase inhibitory potential in silico and biochemically; cyanidin-3-O-glucoside had one of the highest binding affinities with all kinases, especially ABL1 (-8.5 kcal/mol). Cyanidin-3-Oglucoside and delphinidin-3-O-glucoside inhibited EGFR (IC50 = 0.10 and 2.37 mu M, respectively). Cyanidin-3-Oglucoside was the most potent anthocyanin on kinase inhibition.

AB This study investigated the effects of chitosan-based coatings on flavor retention of refrigerated grass carp fillets by using various indicators: free amino acids (FAA), nucleotides, trimethylamine (TMA), volatile profile, sensory quality, and electronic nose analysis. The results indicated that chitosan-based coatings contributed to the significant reduction of off-flavor compounds, such as TMA, hypoxanthine (Hx) and histidine, and accumulation of inosine monophosphate (IMP) and umami-associated FAA. GC-MS analysis showed 23 volatile organic compounds, including many C-5-C-9 aldehydes and alcohols in the fresh fillets. The coating treatments, especially chitosan-clove bud essential oil composite coatings, sharply reduced the relative content of off-odor volatiles, such as hexanal, octanal and 1-octen-3-ol. According to the results of the sensory evaluation and electronic nose analyses, chitosan coating combined with glycerol monolaurate and clove bud essential oil was a promising method to improve the edibility of grass carp fillets by maintaining flavor quality during refrigerated storage.

AB The hips of Rosa species have gained more attention in recent years due to their high contents of antioxidant compounds. This study was designed to compare rosehips of the two roses species Rosa rugosa and Rosa canina, including different products, on carotenoid contents, including phytoene and phytofluene, as well as vitamin E. The investigation allowed the identification and quantification of types of (Z)-isomers of lycopene and rubixanthin in both rosehips and focused also on isomerisation of both carotenoids. The carotenoid identification and quantification were done using HPLC-DAD and LC-MS/MS. The statistical analysis revealed significant differences (P<0.05) in carotenoid contents and (P<0.001) in vitamin E contents between different rosehips species. The HPLC analysis showed that carotenoid contents varied between rosehips species. The isomerisation of (all-E)-rubixanthin and (all-E)-lycopene using iodine-catalysed photoisomerisation showed that the(5'Z)isomer gazaniaxanthin is the main (Z)-isomer of rubixanthin and the (13Z)-isomer is the main (Z)-isomer of lycopene.

AB A straightforward method to determine the content of six opium alkaloids (morphine, codeine, thebaine, noscapine, papaverine and narceine) in poppy seeds and bakery products was developed and validated down to a limit of quantification (LOQ) of 0.1 mg/kg.
   The method was based on extraction with acetonitrile/water/formic acid, ten-fold dilution and analysis by LC-MS/MS using a pH 10 carbonate buffer. The method was applied for the analysis of 41 samples collected in 2015 in the Netherlands and Germany. All samples contained morphine ranging from 0.2 to 240 mg/kg. The levels of codeine and thebaine ranged from below LOQ to 348 mg/kg and from below LOQ to 106 mg/kg, respectively. Sixty percent of the samples exceeded the guidance reference value of 4 mg/kg of morphine set by BfR in Germany, whereas 25% of the samples did not comply with the limits set for morphine, codeine, thebaine and noscapine by Hungarian legislation.

AB The present study describes the rapid microplate method to determine pyruvic acid content in different varieties of onions. Onion juice was treated with 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine to obtain hydrazone, which was further treated with potassium hydroxide to get stable colored complex. The stability of potassium complex was enhanced up to two hours and the structures of hydrazones were confirmed by LC-MS for the first time. The developed method was optimized by testing different bases, acids with varying concentrations of dinitrophenyl hydrazine to get stable color and results were comparable to developed method. Repeatability and precision showed < 9% relative standard deviation. Moreover, sweet onion juice was stored for four weeks at different temperatures for the stability; the pyruvate remained stable at all temperatures except at 25 degrees C. Thus, the developed method has good potential to determine of pungency in large number of onions in a short time using minimal amount of reagents.

AB The aim of the present study was to determine the effect of fruit size on nutritional value, chemical composition and antioxidant properties of Mediterranean okra genotypes. For this purpose, pods from four okra cultivars and local landraces commonly cultivated in Greece, as well as pods from four commercial cultivars from North America were collected at two sizes (3-5 and > 7 cm). Significant differences were observed between the studied genotypes for both nutritional value and chemical composition parameters. Small fruit had a higher nutritional value, whereas chemical composition differed in a genotype dependent manner with most of the studied cultivars showing better results when harvested in small size. In conclusion, fruit size has a genotype dependent impact on chemical composition and nutritional value of okra pods and the common practice of harvesting okra fruit while they still have a small size helps to increase nutritional value for most of the studied genotypes.

AB Booster biocides have been widely applied to ships and other submerged structures. These compounds can be released into the marine environment as the result of vessel hull leaching and may remain in different environmental compartments. This study aimed at introducing an environmentally friendly procedure for the extraction of irgarol and diuron from fish samples by vortex-assisted matrix solid phase dispersion (VA-MSPD) with detection by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. Different types of solid supports and solvents were evaluated. The best results were found when 0.5 g mussel shell, 0.5 g sodium sulfate and 5 mL ethanol were used. Analytical recoveries ranged from 81 to 110%, with RSD below 10%, whereas the matrix effect was between -17 and 1% (for all samples under study). LOQ values of irgarol and diuron were 5 and 50 ng g(-1), respectively. The method under investigation proved to be a promising alternative to controlling contamination of fish by booster biocides, with low consumption of biodegradable reagents.

AB Mechanism of electrical stunning (ES) methods on lipid peroxidation and antioxidant protection were studied by determining meat color, serum variables, antioxidant-related enzyme activities, gene expressions of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), nuclear factor-erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), glutathione S-transferases (GSTs), and superoxide dismutases (SODs). Broilers were sacrificed without stunning, or after ES with 65 V, 86 mA, 1000 Hz (E65 V) or 150 V, 130 mA, 60 Hz (E150V). Serum cortisol and uric acid, muscular malondialdehyde and mRNA levels of MAPKs, Nrf2, GSTA3, GSTT1 and SOD2 were increased, whereas, serum free triiodothyronine, free thyroxine, muscular GST(1d) activity were decreased in E65V compared with E150V. Overall, the serum uric acid and transcription of the MAPK/Nrf2/ARE (antioxidant responsive element) signaling pathway were elevated, but didn't overcome the oxidative stress stimulated by low-current & high-frequency ES, leading to aggravated lipid peroxidation at 1 d and 9 d postmortem in breast muscle compared with high-current & low-frequency ES.

AB The present study deals with the evaluation of antidiabetic activities of Fagioli di Sarconi beans (Phaseolus vulgaris), including 21 ecotypes protected by the European Union with the mark PGI (i.e., Protected Geographical Indication), and cultivated in Basilicata (southern Italy). For this purpose, alpha-glucosidase and alpha-amylase assays were assessed; among all bean ecotypes, the tight green seed colour of Verdolino extracts exhibited the highest alpha-glucosidase and alpha-amylase inhibitory activity with IC50 = 1.1 +/- 0.1 mu g/ml and IC50 = 19.3 +/- 1.1 mu g/ml, respectively. Phytochemical compound screening of all Fagioli di Sarconi beans performed by flow injection-electrospray ionization-ultrahigh resolution mass spectrometry (uHRMS) and based on the calculation of elemental formulas from accurate m/z values, was helpful to annotate specific compounds, such as alkaloids, saponins, flavonoids, and terpenoids, which are most likely responsible for their biological activity.

AB Honey is a food of high importance due to its nutritional value. The effect of late harvest and pollen composition on honey quality and antimicrobial activity was studied. Different physicochemical parameters were determined as quality indicators. The HMF content, diastase activity, sugar content, antimicrobial activity, and hydrogen peroxide content were selected in current work as the crucial parameters for evaluation. The results proved that the late harvested honey sample showed a vast number of pollens from different blossom periods. The hydrogen peroxide content and antimicrobial activity of late harvested honey was significantly increased (proved by t-test), whereas the honey seems to be affected significantly from weather conditions since the HMF content was also increased. The diastase activity was proved to be lower than the respective in fresh honey, whereas no difference was observed on the sugar content. Finally, the effect of origin and processing in late harvested honey was discussed.

AB Accurate description of moisture diffusivity is key to precisely understand and predict moisture transfer behaviour in a matrix. Unfortunately, measuring moisture diffusivity is not trivial, especially at low moisture values and/or elevated temperatures. This paper presents a novel experimental procedure to accurately measure moisture diffusivity based on thermogravimetric approach. The procedure is capable to measure diffusivity even at elevated temperatures (> 70 degrees C) and low moisture values (> 1%). Diffusivity was extracted from experimental data based on "regular regime approach". The approach was tailored to determine diffusivity from thin film and from poly-dispersed powdered samples. Subsequently, measured diffusivity was validated by comparing to available literature data, showing good agreement. Ability of this approach to accurately measure diffusivity at a wider range of temperatures provides better insight on temperature dependency of diffusivity. Thus, this approach can be crucial to ensure good accuracy of moisture transfer description/prediction especially when involving elevated temperatures.

AB Tea polyphenols (TP) were emulsified with corn oil and polysorbate 80 by high-pressure homogenization. The oil in water (O/W) TP nanoemulsion had droplet sizes of 99.42 +/- 1.25 nm after preparation. The TP nanoemulsion was stable during storage at 4, 25 or 40 degrees C for 20 days. An in vitro simulated digestion assay showed that the bioaccessibility of (-)-epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) was increased in the nanoemulsion compared to that in aqueous solution, but that the bioaccessibilities of (-)-epigallocatechin (EGC), (-)-epicatechin (EC) and (-)-gallocatechin gallate (GCG) were greatly decreased. Compared with rats fed an aqueous TP solution, rats fed the TP nanoemulsion had significantly lower maximum plasma concentrations (C-max) of EGCG and EGC, but the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC(0-t)) was increased. The data show that use of a nanoemulsion system to deliver tea polyphenols may enhance the absorption of EGCG through controlled release.

AB Hybrid nanostructures composed of gamma-Fe2O3 (maghemite) and carboxylated-multi walled carbon nanotube (cMWCNT) were used for the magnetic solid phase extractions and determination of Sudan I, II, III, IV, Para Red, Sudan Black B and Sudan Red 7B in chili products. High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) was employed for the measurements. Limit of quantification (LOQ) values were found in the range 0.44-2.82 ng mL(-1) for analytes. The best extraction parameters were determined as pH 8.0, 40 mg of magnetic nanoparticle, 4.0 min of contact time, 0.3 mL desorption by acetonitrile. The samples were dissolved in acetone-dichloromethane-methanol (3: 2: 1, v/v/v) and diluted with acetonitrile-methanol (v/v; 80: 20) before the method was applied. Concentrations of Sudan dyes and Para Red were determined in four samples of chili powder from less than LOQ to 31.21 +/- 1.6 ng g(-1), two samples of chili tomato sauces (lower than LOQ) and two samples of ketchup (lower than LOQ).

AB The present study reports the presence of folate binding proteins (FBPs) in the plants, coriander and Arabidopsis, and their contributions toward folate enhancement. After observing that salicylic acid (SA) enhanced the accumulation of folates in coriander, a study was conducted in Arabidopsis, where twofold increase in folates occurred in foliage upon SA treatment. For obtaining insights into genes involved in SAinduced folate accumulation, microarray data of responsive genes in Arabidopsis were screened. Based on the expression profiles, 19 genes were further analysed by qPCR. The results revealed that folate biosynthetic genes were largely down-regulated, whereas a gene of a putative folate-binding protein (FPB) was upregulated, which correlated with a significant increase of FPBs in foliage. This new information on a plant FBP appears useful for metabolic engineering of a wide range of crops to enhance the content and stability of the folates during post-harvest storage.

AB The freshness of citrus fruits commonly available in the market was non-destructively assessed by Raman spectroscopy. Intact clementine, mandarin and tangerine species were characterised concerning their carotenoids skin Raman signalling in a time course from the moment they were acquired as fresh stock, supplying the market, to the physical degradation, when they were no longer attractive to consumers. The freshness was found to strongly correlate to the peel Raman signal collected from the same area of the intact fruits in a time course of a maximum of 20 days. We have shown that the intensity of the carotenoid Raman signal is indeed a good indicator of fruit freshness and introduced a Raman coefficient of freshness (C-Fresh), whose time course is linearly decreasing, with different slope for different citrus groups. Additionally, we demonstrated that the freshness assessment could be achieved using a portable Raman instrument. The results could have a strong impact for consumer satisfaction and the food industry.

AB An arabinose specific xylanase from glycoside hydrolase family 5 (GH5) was used to hydrolyse wheat and rye arabinoxylan, and the product profile showed that it produced arabinose substituted oligosaccharides (AXOS) having 2-10 xylose residues in the main chain but no unsubstituted xylooligosaccharides (XOS). Molecular modelling showed that the active site has an open structure and that the hydroxyl groups of all xylose residues in the active site are solvent exposed, indicating that arabinose substituents can be accommodated in the glycone as well as the aglycone subsites. The arabinoxylan hydrolysates obtained with the GH5 enzyme stimulated growth of Bifidobacterium adolescentis but not of Lactobacillus brevis. This arabinoxylanase is thus a good tool for the production of selective prebiotics.

AB Trends in HPV vaccine awareness among parents of adolescent girls and boys (ages 13-17) and HPV vaccine uptake (>1 dose) among girls (ages 13-17) were evaluated in Los Angeles County, California. Between 2007 and 2011, parental HPV vaccine awareness increased from 72% to 77% overall, with significant increases among mothers, Latinos, and respondents with daughters and Medi-Cal insured children. In 2011, parents who were male, older, less educated, Asian/Pacific Islander, and had sons remained significantly less likely to be aware. HPV vaccine initiation among daughters nearly doubled from 25% in 2007 to 48% in 2011, and girls who were older, uninsured, and had access-related barriers showed the largest improvements. In 2011, daughters who were younger and who had older and African American parents were at risk for low uptake. Thus, initiatives targeting male and younger adolescents, culturally-relevant information, and access to vaccination may help to reduce identified disparities. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Introduction: Most infants are born with immunity to measles through maternal antibodies transferred in pregnancy, which decay over time. However, in measles elimination settings, where measles does not circulate endemically and most immunity is from immunization rather than infection, maternal antibody levels are lower. This results in infant immunity that wanes earlier, and a wider susceptibility gap between maternal antibody decay and infant immunization than in non-eliminated settings. We aimed to systematically quantify the extent and duration of protection from measles in infants in settings that have sustained measles elimination.
   Methods: We conducted a systematic review of studies of measles maternal antibody waning in infants in measles elimination settings. We searched MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, Scopus, BIOSIS Previews, and Global Health databases for relevant studies. Studies were included if they were set in countries that had eliminated measles for >= 3 years, and if the study cohort included healthy, full-term, unvaccinated infants <= 12 months, born to healthy mothers, and reported a relevant measure of measles maternal antibody in infants. We assessed study quality using the MetaQAT tool.
   Results: We identified 4692 unique citations, eight of which met inclusion criteria. One study reported anti-measles antibody in cord blood, six reported antibody in infant sera, and one reported both. Two studies reported that 80 and 100% of infants were protected from measles at birth. One study reported no protection amongst 3-7 month old infants, and another reported limited protection in infants >4 months. The remaining studies reported the proportion of infants with detected antibody, but not the proportion immune.
   Conclusion: Although limited, these data suggest that in settings that have sustained measles elimination, some infants are susceptible to measles well before the age of routine measles immunization. Setting specific seroprevalence and vaccine effectiveness studies are required to evaluate this in different jurisdictions. Crown Copyright ((C)) 2018 Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Zika virus (ZIKV) is a mosquito-borne flavivirus that has re-emerged and is associated with many debilitating clinical manifestations. Research is currently being conducted to develop a prophylactic vaccine against the virus; however, there has not been any licensed ZIKV vaccine. Recent studies have identified potential B-cell epitopes (amino acids 241-259, 294-315, 317-327, 346-361, 377-388 and 421-437) on the envelope protein of ZIKV, which could be explored to develop peptide vaccines against ZIKV infection. Nevertheless, the immunogenicity of these epitopes has never been assessed. Here, we displayed these epitopes on highly immunogenic bacteriophage virus-like particles (VLPs; MS2, PP7 and Q beta) platforms and assessed their immunogenicity in mice. Mice immunized with a mixture of VLPs displaying ZIKV envelope B-cell epitopes elicited anti-ZIKV antibodies. Although, immunized mice were not protected against a high challenge dose of ZIKV, sera- albeit at low titers-from immunized mice neutralized (in vitro) a low dose of ZIKV. Taken together, these results show that these epitopes are B-cell epitopes and they are immunogenic when displayed on a Q beta VLP platform. Furthermore, the results also show that immunization with VLPs displaying a single B-cell epitope minimally reduces ZIKV infection whereas immunization with a mixture of VLPs displaying a combination of the B-cell epitopes neutralizes ZIKV infection. Thus, immunization with a mixture of VLPs displaying multiple ZIKV B-cell epitopes is a good strategy to enhance ZIKV neutralization. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB While the impact of the timeliness of vaccine administration has been well-studied for childhood vaccinations, there has been little detailed quantitative analysis on the potential impact of the timeliness of vaccinations in older adults. The aim of this study was to explore the impact of implementing more realistic observed uptake distributions, taking into the account reduced vaccine efficacy but higher pneumococcal, disease burden with increasing age beyond 65 years. A multi-cohort Markov model was constructed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of a pneumococcal (PCV13) immunisation program in Australia, assuming two different uptake modelling approaches. The approach using an estimate of observed uptake was compared with a scenario in which the total cumulative uptake was delivered at the recommended age of vaccination. We found these two approaches produced different results both in terms of cases prevented and cost-effectiveness. The impact of the non-timely uptake in adult programs may sometimes have positive and other times negative effects, depending on several factors including the age-specific disease rates and the duration of vaccine protection. Our study highlights the importance of using realistic assumptions around uptake (including non-timely vaccination) when estimating the impact of vaccination in adults. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Background: There have been inconsistent reports of decreased vaccine effectiveness (VE) against influenza viruses among older adults (aged >= 65 years) compared with younger adults in the United States. A direct comparison of VE over multiple seasons is needed to assess the consistency of these observations.
   Methods: We performed a pooled analysis of VE over 5 seasons among adults aged >= 18 years who were systematically enrolled in the U.S. Flu VE Network. Outpatients with medically-attended acute respiratory illness (cough with illness onset <= 7 days prior to enrollment) were tested for influenza by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. We compared differences in VE and vaccine failures among older adult age group (65-74, >= 75, and >= 65 years) to adults aged 18-49 years by influenza type and subtype using interaction terms to test for statistical significance and stratified by prior season vaccination status.
   Results: Analysis included 20,022 adults aged >= 18 years enrolled during the 2011-12 through 2015-16 influenza seasons; 4,785 (24%) tested positive for influenza. VE among patients aged >= 65 years was not significantly lower than VE among patients aged 18-49 years against any subtype with no significant interaction of age and vaccination. VE against A(H3N2) viruses was 14% (95% confidence interval [CI] -14% to 36%) for adults >= 65 years and 21% (CI 9-32%) for adults 18-49 years. VE against A(H1N1) pdm09 was 49% (95% CI 22-66%) for adults >= 65 years and 48% (95% CI 41-54%) for adults 18-49 years and against B viruses was 62% (95% CI 44-74%) for adults >= 65 years and 55% (95% CI 45-63%) for adults 18-49 years. There was no significant interaction of age and vaccination for separate strata of prior vaccination status.
   Conclusions: Over 5 seasons, influenza vaccination provided similar levels of protection among older and younger adults, with lower levels of protection against influenza A(H3N2) in all ages. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Introduction: Since 2008, two types of hepatitis A (HepA) vaccines were integrated into the expanded program on immunization (EPI) in China. Children were given either one dose of live attenuated HepA (L-HepA) or two doses of inactivated HepA (I-HepA), depending on geographic regions. We sought to evaluate the impact of the EPI on HepA incidence in China.
   Methods: We reviewed the epidemiology of HepA during 2004-2016 from National Notifiable Disease Reporting System (NNDRS). We collected data of L-HepA and I-HepA coverage from Children Immunization Information Management System (CIIMS). Based on the regions where two types of HepA vaccines were used, the coverage and incidence of HepA were compared over time.
   Results: In 2008-2016, the HepA vaccine coverage was 98.8% among target children, with 99.6% in I-HepA region and 98.7% in L-HepA region. HepA incidence declined by 78.0% and 82.3% in L-HepA region and I-HepA region, respectively, without significant difference. Dramatic decline were seen in all age groups of both regions.
   Conclusion: The study suggests that the EPI, with high coverage for both I-HepA and L-HepA, had positive impact on HepA incidence in China. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background: CMV infections are the most frequent congenital infections worldwide.
   Aim: Assess the cost-effectiveness of vaccination strategies of adolescent girls vs. current practice (hygiene counseling) to prevent CMV seroconversions during pregnancy in France.
   Method: A Markov decision-tree model simulated overtime the trajectory of a single fictive cohort of 390,000 adolescent women aged 14 years old, living in France. Impact of vaccination was explored until the end of their reproductive live 40 years later.
   Strategies compared: "S1: No vaccination" (current practice); "S2: Routine vaccination"; "S3: Screening and vaccination of the seronegative". Model parameters: Seroconversion rate without vaccination (0.035%/pregnant woman-week); fetal transmission risk (41%). Vaccine vs. no vaccination: a 50% decrease in maternal seroconversions.
   Outcomes: Quality-Adjusted Life-Years (QALYs) of the cohort-born babies; discounted costs; Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio (ICER).
   Results: S2 was the most effective strategy (with 35,000 QALYs gained) and the most expensive ((sic)211,533,000); S1 was the least effective and least costly ((sic)75,423,000). ICER5 of strategy S3 vs. S1, and S2 vs. S3 were 6,000(sic)/QALY gained (95% uncertainty range [2700-13,300]) and 16,000(sic)/QALY [negative ICER (S3 dominated by S2)-94,000] gained, respectively; highly cost-effective because ICER < 1* France's GPD/capita = (sic)30,000.
   Sensitivity analysis: If the seroprevalence was >62% (vs. 20% in the base case), S3 would become the most efficient strategy.
   Conclusion:, In France, systematic vaccination of adolescent girls was the most efficient strategy to prevent maternal seroconversions. If the population was less than 62% immune, systematic screening and vaccination of susceptibles would become the most cost-effective approach. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background: Capsular group X N. meningitidis (MenX) has emerged as a cause of localized disease outbreaks in sub-Saharan Africa, but the human immune response following exposure to MenX antigens is poorly described. We therefore assessed the natural immunity against MenX in individuals who were living in an area affected by a MenX outbreak during 2007 in Togo, West Africa. During 2009,300 healthy individuals (100 aged 3-5 years, 100 aged 13-19 years and 100 aged 20-25 years) were included in the study, and serum responses were compared with sera from age-matched controls from the U.K. and Burkina Faso.
   Methods: MenX serum bactericidal antibody (SBA) was measured using rabbit complement, and antibodies against MenX polysaccharide (XPS) and outer membrane vesicles (X0MVs) were quantified by ELISA.
   Results: The proportion of Togolese individuals with an SBA titer of >= 8 against the MenX strain was 29% (95% confidence interval (CI) 18-41) among those aged 3-5 years, 34% (95% CI 9-60) among those aged 13-19 years and 32% (95% Cl 24-40) among those aged 20-25 years. These were significantly higher than observed in the control populations from the U.K (range 13-16%) and Burkina Faso (range 2-6%).
   Conclusion: In Togolese individuals, the concentration of serum IgG against XPS was higher among the two older age groups as compared to the youngest age group. Antibody concentrations against MenX PS correlated significantly with SBA titers. This supports further development of a MenX PS based conjugate vaccine. Further studies are needed to verify the ability of MenX PS to induce SBA in humans. (C) 2018. The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Objectives: The objective of this study was to evaluate the impact of introduction of 9vHPV vaccine on HPV vaccination uptake (doses per capita) and initiation (>= 1 doses), completion (>= 3 doses) and compliance (>= 3 doses within 12 months) by adolescents.
   Methods: We used a retrospective cohort analysis using North Carolina Immunization Registry (NCIR) data from January 2008 through October 2016. The sample included Vaccines for Children eligible adolescents aged 9 to 17 years in 2016, for whom the NCIR contains complete vaccination history. We applied an interrupted time series design to measure associations between ZIP Code Tabulation Area (ZCTA)-level HPV vaccination outcomes over time with the introduction of 9vHPV in North Carolina (NC) in July 2015.
   Results: Each outcome displayed a linear upward trend over time with large seasonal spikes near August of each year, corresponding to the time when adolescents often receive other vaccines required for school entry. After accounting for these underlying trends, introduction of 9vHPV was not associated with a change in publicly funded HPV vaccination rates in NC.
   Conclusions: Our results indicate that 9vHPV substituted for 4vHPV in the first year after release in NC, but the release of 9vHPV was not associated with an overall change in HPV vaccination. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Objectives: The objective of this study was to describe the transition from bi- and quadrivalent HPV vaccines to 9vHPV in aggregate and identify determinants of the receipt of 9vHPV among youth following the introduction of 9vHPV in North Carolina.
   Methods: The study used a retrospective cohort design with data from the North Carolina Immunization Registry (NCIR). Our sample included all doses of HPV vaccine administered between July 2015 and October 2016 to age-eligible youth (ages 9-17). We used a logistic regression model to associate individual child-level and ZIP Code Tabulation Area (ZCTA)-level characteristics with an indicator variable for receiving 9vHPV (vs. other HPV vaccines).
   Results: Youth receiving the HPV vaccine were more likely to receive 9vHPV if they lived in a ZCTA with a larger age-eligible (i.e., 9-17) population, a health professional shortage area, or a higher number of annual outpatient visits per capita. They were less likely to receive 9vHPV if they were older, received a publicly-funded dose, or lived in a ZCTA with a higher percentage of the population with less than a high-school education or a higher number of religious organizations.
   Conclusions: While the transition from other HPV vaccines to 9vHPV was relatively quick, there were disparities in the diffusion of 9vHPV across North Carolina. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In our previous study, ten candidate proteins have been identified with immunogenicity and protection against Vibrio anguillarum in flounder (Paralichthys olivaceus). Among them, FlaC is the important outer protein in the flagellum with immunogenicity; VAA, OmpK and OmpR are protection proteins against V. anguillarum. In this paper, FlaC supplemented with VAA, OmpK or OmpR as bivalent subunit vaccine candidates, and their immune response of flounder and protective effects were evaluated, respectively. Recombinant(r) proteins of FlaC were mixed with rVAA, rOmpK and rOmpR, respectively, rVAA+rFlaC (AF), rOmpK+rFlaC (KF) and rOmpR+rFlaC (RF); formalin-killed cells (FKC) or PBS were injected to flounder, respectively. After immunization, the percentages of CD3(+) T lymphocytes and surface membrane immunoglobulin-positive (sIg(+)) B lymphocytes in peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs), total antibodies (TA), specific antibodies against V. anguillarum (VA), specific antibodies against bivalent recombinant proteins (PA), the expression of immune-related genes and relative percent survivals (RPS) were measured, respectively. The results showed that three bivalent vaccines candidates and FKC could induce the proliferation of sIg(+) B lymphocytes and CD3(+) T lymphocytes in PBLs. The TA, VA and PA induced in bivalent vaccines candidates and FKC groups were significantly higher than that of the control group. CD3, IgM, CD4-1, CD4-2, CD8 alpha and CD8 beta genes were up-regulated. After challenge with V. anguillarum, RPS in AF, KF, RF and FKC groups exhibited 62.6 +/- 2.33%, 78.95 +/- 3.01%, 75.45 +/- 0.97%, and 56.71 +/- 2.15% respectively. The results revealed that three bivalent vaccines candidates and FKC could induce the immune response in flounder, and have good protection against V. anguillarum, and KF can be an efficient bivalent subunit vaccine candidate.

AB Although Enterovirus 71 (EV71) has only one serotype based on serum neutralization tests using hyper immune animal antisera, three major genogroups (A, B and C) including eleven genotypes (A, B1-B2, and Cl-C5) can be well classified based on phylogenetic analysis. Since 1997, large-scale EV71 epidemics occurred cyclically with different genotypes in the Asia-Pacific region. Therefore, development of EV71 vaccines is a national priority in several Asian countries. Currently, five vaccine candidates have been evaluated in clinical trials in China (three C4 candidates), Singapore (one 132 candidate), and Taiwan (one B4 candidate). Overall, the peak viral titers of these 5 vaccine candidates could only reach about 107 TCID50/mL. Moreover, genotypes of these 5 candidates are different from the current predominant genotype B5 in Taiwan and South-Eastern Asia. We adapted a high-growth EV71 genotype B5 (HG-B5) virus after multiple passages and plaque selections in Vero cells and the HG-B5 virus could reach high titers (>10(B) TCID50/mL) in a microcarrier-based cell culture system. The viral particles were further purified and formulated with alum adjuvant. After two doses of intramuscular immunization in rabbits, the HG-B5 vaccine candidate could induce cross-reactive neutralizing antibodies against the three major EV71 genogroups. In conclusion, a high-growth EV71 virus was successfully adapted in Vero cells and could induce broad spectrum neutralizing antibody titers against three (A, B5, and C4) genotypes in rabbits.

AB Since a novel hyper-virulent fowl adenovirus serotype 4 (FAdV-4) infection occurred in 2015, the novel FAdV-4 has been widely spreading across China, causing significant economic losses to the poultry industry. As the urgency of the issue calls for effective and efficient solutions, the present study investigated the possibility of the fiber-2 protein of the FAdV-4 to serve as a vaccine candidate against the novel FAdV-4. In the research, fiber-2 proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli, and then purified. To evaluate the immunogenicity of the recombinant fiber-2 protein, we investigated both the humoral and cellular immune responses in chickens immunized with fiber-2. The humoral immunity was assessed by detecting IgY antibodies and virus-neutralizing antibodies in chicken serum at 7, 14, 21 days post immunization (dpi). We examined cellular immune responses by detecting CD3+CD4+ and CD3+CD8+ changes in chickens' peripheral blood through using flow cytometry at 7, 14, 21 dpi. The cytokine production in the serum of the immunized chickens was detected by ELISA at 7, 14, 21 dpi to further explore the impact of the recombinant protein on the regulation of cytokines. The protective efficacy was determined by the survival rate of the immunized chickens challenged with the novel FAdV-4. The results show that the level of IgY antibodies of the chickens immunized with fiber-2 protein was significantly higher than that of the chickens immunized with an inactivated vaccine against FAdV-4. Moreover, 7 days after immunization, the CD4+ T-cell proliferative response of the chickens immunized with fiber-2 was significantly higher than that of the chickens immunized with the inactivated vaccine. Challenge experiment showed that the fiber-2 protein could provide full protection and the inactivated vaccine could provide 90 percent protection against the FAdV-4. These results suggest that the recombinant fiber-2 protein can be an ideal candidate for subunit vaccines against the disease. (C) 2018 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB We examined the relationship between complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) use and vaccination scepticism; and specifically whether a person's more general health-related worldview might explain this relationship. A cross-sectional online survey of adult Australians (N = 2697) included demographic, CAM, and vaccination measures, as well as the holistic and magical health belief scales (HHB, MHB). HHB emphasises links between mind and body health, and the impact of general 'wellness' on specific ailments or resistance to disease, whilst MHB specifically taps ontological confusions and cognitive errors about health. CAM and anti-vaccination were found to be linked primarily at the attitudinal level (r = -0.437). We did not find evidence that this was due to CAM practitioners influencing their clients. Applying a path-analytic approach, we found that individuals' health worldview (HHB and MHB) accounted for a significant proportion (43.1%) of the covariance between CAM and vaccination attitudes. MHB was by far the strongest predictor of both CAM and vaccination attitudes in regressions including demographic predictors. We conclude that vaccination scepticism reflects part of a broader health worldview that discounts scientific knowledge in favour of magical or superstitious thinking. Therefore, persuasive messages reflecting this worldview may be more effective than fact-based campaigns in influencing vaccine sceptics. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background: Haemophilus influenzae (Hi) causes respiratory infections and pathogenesis of this microbe begins in the human nasopharynx (NP). The objective of this study was to assess the correlation of NP colonization-induced serum antibody levels to Hi protein D with risk of acute otitis media (AOM) in children <2 yr.
   Methods: 455 sera from 213 children (age 6-24 months old) were collected when they were colonized with Hi and when the children developed AOM. Presence of Hi during AOM was confirmed by culture of middle ear fluid. Quantitative ELISA was used to determine serum IgG against protein D antigen.
   Results: Asymptomatic Hi NP colonization reduced the risk of future AOM infections. Higher serum IgG titers against Hi protein D were correlated with reduced future AOM risk.
   Conclusion: Colonization by Hi reduces future AOM risk. Higher antibody levels against protein D correlates with lower risk of AOM caused by Hi. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB A clear vision for vaccines research and development (R&D) is needed if Europe is to continue to lead the discovery of next generation vaccines. Innovation Partnership for a Roadmap on Vaccines in Europe (IPROVE) is a collaboration between leading vaccine experts to develop a roadmap setting out how Europe can best invest in the science and technology essential for vaccines innovation. This FP7 project, started in December 2013, brought together more than 130 key public and private stakeholders from academia, public health institutes, regulators, industry and small and medium-sized enterprises to determine and prioritise the gaps and challenges to be addressed to bolster innovation in vaccines and vaccination in Europe. The IPROVE consultation process was structured around seven themes: vaccine R&D, manufacturing and quality control, infrastructure, therapeutic vaccines, needs of small and medium-sized enterprises, vaccines acceptance and training needs.
   More than 80 recommendations were made by the consultation groups, mainly focused on the need for a multidisciplinary research approach to stimulate innovation, accelerated translation of scientific knowledge into technological innovation, and fostering of real collaboration within the European vaccine ecosystem. The consultation also reinforced the fact that vaccines are only as good as their vaccine implementation programmes, and that more must be done to understand and address vaccination hesitancy of both the general public and healthcare professionals.
   Bringing together a wide range of stakeholders to work on the [PROVE roadmap has increased mutual understanding of their different perspectives, needs and priorities. IPROVE is a first attempt to develop such a comprehensive view of the vaccine sector. This prioritisation effort, aims to help policy-makers and funders identify those vaccine-related areas and technologies where key investment is needed for short and medium-long term success. 2017 The Author(s).

AB Vaccination remains the best available prophylaxis to prevent influenza virus infections, yet current inadequacies in influenza virus vaccine manufacturing often lead to vaccine shortages at times when the vaccine is most needed, as it was the case during the last influenza virus pandemic. Novel influenza virus vaccine production systems will be crucial to improve public health and safety. Here we report the optimization of influenza B virus growth in the proprietary EB66 (R) cell line, currently in use for human vaccine production. To this end, we collected, curated and sequenced 71 influenza B viruses selected for high diversity in date of isolation and lineage. This viral collection was tested for ability to enter and replicate within EB66 (R) cells in a single cycle assay and appears to readily infect these cells. When the collection was tested for viral progeny production in a multi-cycle assay, we found a large variation from strain to strain. The strains with the top growth characteristics from the B/Victoria and B/Yamagata lineages were selected for vaccine backbone generation using a reverse genetics system. We then showed that these backbones maintain their desirable growth within EB66 (R) cells when the HA and NA from poorly growing strains were substituted for the parental segments, indicating that the selected backbones are viable options for vaccine production in EB66 (R). Finally, we show that compounds previously reported to enhance influenza virus growth in cell culture also increase virus production in the EB66 (R) cell line. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The parasite Neospora caninum is the main cause of abortion in cattle in many countries around the world, so a vaccine is a rational approach method for the control of the disease. An effective vaccine should be able to prevent both, the horizontal and vertical transmission of N. caninum. In this study, the immune vaccinal response of the recombinant protein rNcSRS2 of N. caninum expressed in Pichia pastoris and formulated with water-in-oil emulsion, xanthan gum, and alum hydroxide was assessed in an experimental murine model. Groups of 10 Balb/c mice were subcutaneously inoculated with two doses of prNcSRS2 twenty-one days apart. After the second immunization, four mice from each group were euthanized, and splenocytes were stimulated ex vivo with recombinant protein. The IgG dynamics were evaluated by indirect ELISA, and the splenocytes cytokines transcription by qPCR. All groups elicited specific antibodies against prNcSRS2, with the water-in-oil group showing significantly (p <= .05) elevated titers compared to the other groups. The prNcSRS2 protein alone did not induce a significant ex vivo splenic transcription level of IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha, IL-4, IL-10, and 1L-12 cytokines, except for IL-17A, and the adjuvant associations with the prNcSRS2 protein induced different cytokine transcription profiles. The water-in oil emulsion modulated the expression of TNF-alpha; the xanthan gum modulated IL-4, IL-10, and IL-12; and alum hydroxide modulated IFN-gamma, TNF-a, IL-4, IL-10, and IL-12. In conclusion, it was found that the association of the recombinant prNcSRS2 protein with different adjuvants induced different levels of specific antibody, and a distinct splenic cytokine profile in an adjuvant-dependent manner. The mechanisms of adjuvancity activity is complex, so adjuvant formulation may help in the design of efficient vaccine to control Neosporosis. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The recent resurgence of pertussis in England and Wales has been marked by infant deaths and rising cases in teens and adults. To understand which age cohorts are most responsible for these trends, we employed three separate statistical methods to analyze high-resolution pertussis reports from 1982 to 2012. The fine-grained nature of the time-series allowed us to describe the changes in age-specific incidence and contrast the transmission dynamics in the 1980s and during the resurgence era. Our results identified infants and school children younger than 10 years of age as a core group, prior to 2002: pertussis incidence in these populations was predictive of incidence in other age groups. After 2002, no core groups were identifiable. This conclusion is independent of methodology used. Because it is unlikely that the underlying contact patterns substantially changed over the study period, changes in predictability likely result from the introduction of more stringent diagnostics tests that may have inadvertently played a role in masking the relative contributions of core transmission groups.

AB Inactivated influenza vaccines are not approved for use in infants less than 6 months of age due to poor immunogenicity in that population. While the live attenuated influenza vaccine has the potential to be more immunogenic, it is not an option for infants and other vulnerable populations, including the elderly and immunocompromised individuals due to safety concerns. In an effort to improve the immunogenicity of the inactivated vaccine for use in vulnerable populations, we have used an approach of chemically crosslinking the Toll-like receptor (TLR) 7/8 agonist R848 directly to virus particles. We have reported previously that an R848-conjugated, inactivated vaccine is more effective at inducing adaptive immune responses and protecting against lung pathology in influenza challenged neonatal African green monkeys than is the unmodified counterpart. In the current study, we describe a second generation vaccine that utilizes an amide-sulfhydryl crosslinker with different spacer chemistry and length to couple R848 to virions. The new vaccine has significantly enhanced immunostimulatory activity for murine macrophages and importantly for monocyte derived human dendritic cells. Demonstration of the significant differences in stimulatory activity afforded by modest changes in linker impacts our fundamental view of the design of TLR agonist-antigen vaccines.

AB Background: Infection with hepatitis A and hepatitis B virus can increase the risk of morbidity and mortality in persons with chronic liver disease (CLD). The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommends hepatitis A (HepA) and hepatitis B (HepB) vaccination for persons with CLD.
   Methods: Data from the 2014 and 2015 National Health Interview Surveys (NHIS), nationally representative, in-person interview surveys of the non-institutionalized US civilian population, were used to assess self-reported HepA (>= 1 and >= 2 doses) and HepB vaccination (>= 1 and >= 3 doses) coverage among adults who reported a chronic or long-term liver condition. Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify factors independently associated with HepA and HepB vaccination among adults with CLD.
   Results: Overall, 19.4% and 11.5% of adults aged >= 18 years with CLD reported receiving >= 1 dose and >= 2 doses of HepA vaccine, respectively, compared with 14.7% and 9.1% of adults without CLD (p < .05 comparing those with and without CLD, >= ldose). Age, education, geographic region, and international travel were associated with receipt of >= 2 doses HepA vaccine among adults with CLD. Overall, 35.7% and 29.1% of adults with CLD reported receiving >= 1 dose and >= 3 doses of HepB vaccine, respectively, compared with 30.2% and 24.7% of adults without CLD (p < .05 comparing those with and without CLD, >= 1 dose). Age, education, and receipt of influenza vaccination in the past 12 months were associated with receipt of >= 3 doses HepB vaccine among adults with CLD. Among adults with CLD and >= 10 provider visits, only 13.8% and 35.3% had received >= 2 doses HepA and >= 3 doses HepB vaccine, respectively.
   Conclusions: HepA and HepB vaccination among adults with CLD is suboptimal and missed opportunities to vaccinate occurred. Providers should adhere to recommendations to vaccinate persons with CLD to increase vaccination among this population. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Currently, there is no approved vaccine for visceral leishmaniasis (VL) caused by L donovani. The ability to manipulate Leishmania genome by eliminating or introducing genes necessary for parasites' survival considered as the powerful strategy to generate the live attenuated vaccine. In the present study fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (LdFBPase) gene deleted L donovani (Delta fbpase) was generated using homologous gene replacement strategy. Though LdFBPase gene deletion (Delta fbpase) does not affect the growth of parasite in the promastigote form but axenic amastigotes display a marked reduction in their capacity to multiply in vitro inside macrophages and in vivo in Balb/c mice. Though Delta fbpase L donovani parasite persisted in BALB/c mice up to 12 weeks but was unable to cause infection, we tested its ability to protect against a virulent L donovani challenge. Notably, intraperitoneal immunisation with live Delta fbpase parasites displayed the reduction of parasites load in mice spleen and liver post challenge. Moreover, immunised BALB/c mice showed a reversal of T cell anergy and high levels of NO production that result in the killing of the parasite. A significant, correlation was found between parasite clearance and elevated IFN gamma, IL12, and IFN gamma ilL10 ratio compared to 11.10 and TGF beta in immunised and challenged mice. Results suggested the generation of protective Th1 type immune response which induced significant parasite clearance at 12-week, as well as 16 weeks post, challenged immunised mice, signifying sustained immunity. Therefore, we propose that Delta fbpase L donovani parasites can be a live attenuated vaccine candidate for VL and a good model to understand the correlatives of protection in visceral leishmaniasis.

ID IMMUNIZATION; ERADICATION
AB Introduction: Vaccine-associated paralytic poliomyelitis (VAPP) is one of the most important adverse effects of vaccines that are in current use globally. The Chinese national adverse event following immunization information system (CNAEFIS) is a passive surveillance system which collects data on VAPP. Aims: To describe the epidemiological characteristics of VAPP and estimate the risk of recipient VAPP in China.
   Methods: We retrieved information from reported cases of recipient VAPP from CNAEFIS from 2010 to 2015, examined the demographic characteristics of the cases, and used administrative data on vaccination doses and the estimated number of births as denominators to calculate VAPP incidence.
   Results: During 2010-2015, 157 cases of recipient VAPP were reported to CNAEFIS (male-to-female ratio, 8.2:1); 151 cases (96.2%) were less than six months old. All cases were associated with trivalent OPV (tOPV), and 89.8% occurred after the receipt of first dose. Of the 157 recipient VAPP cases, type II, type III, and type I poliovirus vaccine strains were isolated from 27 (17.2%), 25 (15.9%), and 16 (10.2%) cases, respectively. One case died and one case recovered completely; the other 155 cases had various physical disabilities, such as monolateral or bilateral limping. Using the administered doses of OPV as the denominator, the incidence of recipient VAPP during the study period was estimated at 0.4 per million doses. The estimated recipient VAPP per million births ranged from 1.0 to 2.4 during 2010-2015.
   Conclusion: The epidemiological characteristics of recipient VAPP cases in China, such as age distribution, were comparable to those in previous studies from other countries. The risk of recipient VAPP, using either estimated births or vaccination doses, was comparable to that in the US and Japan. We recommend using an inactive poliovirus vaccine to decrease the number of recipient VAPP cases in China. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background: Recent observational studies in the United States indicated live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) was less effective in children against clinical influenza infection caused by A(H1N1)pdm09 relative to inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV). During the 2013-2014 influenza season, we conducted an observational study among children aged 5-17 years to compare serologic responses to LAIV and IIV and explore factors associated with vaccine failure.
   Methods: One hundred and sixty-one children received one dose of trivalent 11V or quadrivalent LAIV according to parental preference. Baseline and postvaccination serum samples were tested with hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assays against vaccine reference strains. Geometric mean titers (GMT), geometric mean fold rise (GMFR), seroconversion, and seroprotection (HI titer >= 40) were used to assess response to vaccine. Active surveillance for acute respiratory illness was conducted during the influenza season and influenza cases were confirmed by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Logistic regression was used to examine the association between vaccine type and vaccine failure.
   Results: LAIV and IIV recipients were similar with respect to demographics and baseline GMT for each vaccine strain. RT-PCR confirmed influenza (vaccine failure) occurred in 8 (13%) of 62 LAIV recipients and 3 (3%) of 99 IIV recipients (p = .02). Postvaccination GMFR for A(H1N1)pdm09 was higher for IIV vs LAIV receipt (GMFR 3.3 vs. 0.8, p < .0001). Postvaccination titers against A(H1N1)pdm09 were >= 40 for 91% and 44% of IIV and LAIV recipients, respectively (p < .0001). Among 13 IIV and 18 LAIV recipients with seronegative baseline titer against A(H1N1pdm09), 54% and 0% seroconverted, respectively. LAIV receipt was the only factor associated with A(H1N1)pdm09 vaccine failure in the age-adjusted multivariable model (odds ratio 4.5, 95% CI 1.1-18.2).
   Conclusion: Receipt of LAIV generated minimal HI antibody response in children, including among those seronegative at baseline. LAN recipients had significant increased risk of A(H1N1)pdm09 infection compared to IIV recipients. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background: We conducted a randomized, non-inferiority, clinical study of MMR vaccine by a disposable syringe jet injector (DSJI) in toddlers in India in comparison with the conventional administration.
   Methods: MMR vaccine was administered subcutaneously by DSJI or needle-syringe (N-S) to toddlers (15-18 months) who had received a measles vaccine at 9 months. Seropositivity to measles, mumps, and rubella serum IgG antibodies was assessed 35 days after vaccination. Non-inferiority was concluded if the upper limit of the 95% CI for the difference in the percent of seropositive between groups was less than 10%. Solicited reactions were collected for 14 days after vaccination by using structured diaries.
   Results: In each study group, 170 subjects received MMR vaccine. On day 35, seropositivity for measles was 97.5% [95% CI (93.8%, 99.3%)] in the DSJI group and 98.7% [95% CI (95.5%, 99.8%)] in the N-S group; for mumps, 98.8% [95% CI (95.6%, 99.8%)] and 98.7% [95% CI (95.5%, 99.8%)]; and for rubella, 98.8% [95% CI (95.6%, 99.8%)] and 100% [95% CI (97.7%, 100.0%)]; none of the differences were significant. The day 35 post-vaccination GMT5 in DSJI and N-S groups were measles: 5.48 IU/ml [95% CI (3.71, 8.11)] and 5.94 IU/ml [95% CI (3.92, 9.01)), mumps: 3.83 ISR [95% CI (3.53, 4.14)] and 3.66 ISR [95% CI (3.39, 3.95)] and rubella: 95.27 IU/ml [95% CI (70.39, 128.95)] and 107.06 IU/ml [95% CI (79.02, 145.06)]; none of the differences were significant.
   The DSJI group reported 173 solicited local reactions and the N-S group reported 112; most were mild grade. Of the total of 156 solicited systemic adverse events, most were mild, and incidence between the two groups was similar.
   Conclusions: MMR vaccination via DSJI is as immunogenic as vaccination by N-S. Safety profile of DSJI method is similar to N-S except for injection site reactions which are more with DSJI and are well tolerated. (C) 2018 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Background: The primary objectives of HIV Vaccine Trials Network (HVTN) phase 1 preventive HIV vaccine clinical trials are to assess safety and immune response to study products. Participant alcohol and drug use may affect adherence, retention, and risk of HIV infection. Data on the effects of substance use are limited to medical care compliance and treatment adherence in HIV infected participants. To our knowledge, there are no data assessing substance use and retention in these vaccine trials.
   Methods: We performed a meta-analysis on substance use and its impact on retention in HVTN phase I trials that recruited participants demonstrating lower risk profiles for HIV infection. Our analysis included data from 10 HVTN phase 1 clinical trials conducted between February 2009 and September 2014 in the Americas and Switzerland that utilized the identical interviewer-administered behavioral risk assessment questionnaire to capture participant self-report of substance use in the previous six months. Chi Square tests were used to assess statistical differences between variables.
   Results: Among the 964 participants, 170 (18%) missed a clinic visit and 78 (8%) terminated early from clinic follow-up; 75/774 (10%) on studies with multiple vaccination timepoints did not complete their vaccinations. Neither frequency of alcohol use, binge drinking, marijuana, nor other drug use reported at screening visits were associated with the three adherence/retention measures. Binge drinking was associated with higher rates of unprotected sex while drunk (p < .001).
   Conclusions: Light to moderate alcohol use does not negatively impact adherence or retention in phase I clinical trials. Based on these screening data and the low infection rate of participants during the trial period, the screening process for participation in HVTN phase 1 trials has largely been successful in enrolling and retaining individuals with lower risk profiles. Focusing on binge drinking and increased HIV/STI risk during risk reduction counseling may be warranted. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The pathogenesis of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is regulated by various miRNAs. In this study, we identified that miR-875-5pis up-regulated in NSCLC patients, and inhibited SATB Homeobox 2(SATB2) to promote proliferation and invasion of NSCLCce1ls.CCK-8assay revealed thatmiR-875-5p mimics promoted proliferation of NSCLC cells. Transwell assay showed that miR-875-5pmimicspromoted the invasion and migration of NSCLC cells. Luciferase assays confirmed that miR-875-5pdirectly binds to the 3'untranslated region of SATB2, and western blotting showed that miR-875-5psuppresses the expression of SATB2 at the protein level. Moreover, the inhibitors of miR-875-5pinhibit proliferation and invasion of NSCLC cell lines. The miR-875-5pwouldbe a potential therapeutic target for NSCLC treatment in the future.

AB Though LIM-domain protein AJUBA was identified as a putative oncogene, the function and underlying mechanisms of AJUBA in cervical cancer remain largely unknown. Firstly, AJUBA expression was detected via real-time quantitative PCR in patients' samples. Furthermore, Hela and Siha cells were transfected with AJUBA-overexpressing plasmids, and then exposed to cisplatin, the apoptosis was measured by cytometry assay. In addition, the expression of YAP and TAZ was disclosed through western blot assay. Our results revealed that AJUBA expression was significantly higher in the cervical cancer patients resistant to cisplatin treatment compared with cervical cancer patients sensitive to cisplatin treatment. In addition, overall survival time was significantly shorter in the cervical cancer patients with high AJUBA expression compare with those with low AJUBA expression using kaplan-meier analysis. Hela and Siha cells transfected with AJUBA-expressing plasmids exposed to cisplatin treatment had higher survival rate compared with the cells transfected with empty vector control. Mechanistic studies revealed the AJUBA upregulated the downstream targets YAP and TAZ. These results suggest that high AJUBA level enhances cervical cancer cells drug resistance to cisplatin, also associates with decreased patient survival times.

AB For cost-effective lignocellulosic biofuel/chemical production, consolidated bioprocessing (CBP)-enabling microorganisms utilizing cellulose as well as producing biofuel/chemical are required. A novel strain Paenibacillus sp. CAA11 isolated from sediment was found to be not only as a cellulose degrader under both aerobic and strict anaerobic conditions but also as a producer of cellulosic biofuel/chemicals. Paenibacillus sp. CAA11 secreted cellulolytic enzymes by its own secretion system and produced ethanol as well as short-chain organic acids (formic acid, acetic acid, lactic acid) from cellulose. Cellulolytic activity of the strain was significantly enhanced by expressing a heterologous endoglucanase 168Cel5 from Bacillus subtilis under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions. The strain harboring the 168cel5 gene revealed 2-fold bigger halo zone on Congo-red plate and 1.75-fold more aerobic cellulose utilization in liquid medium compared with the negative control. Notably, under anaerobic conditions, the recombinant strain expressing 168Cel5 consumed 1.83-fold more cellulose (5.10 g/L) and produced 5-fold more ethanol (0.65 g/L) along with 5-fold more total acids (1.6 g/L) compared with the control, resulting 2.73-fold higher yields. This result demonstrates the potential of Paenibacillus sp. CAA11 as a suitable aerobic and anaerobic CBP-enabling microbe with cellulolytic production of ethanol and short-chain organic acids.

AB Autoinducer-2 (AI-2) is a major signal molecule in bacterial quorum sensing (QS) besides N-acyl homoserine lactones (AHLs or AI-1). AI-2 mediated QS pathways have been proved to regulate gene expression and physiological behaviors of bacteria in either intraspecies or interspecies communication. Recent reviews have mainly summarized AI-2 structures, AI-2 mediated QS pathways and the role of AI-2 in gene regulation, etc. In this article, we present a comprehensive review of AI-2 production, detection and applications. Firstly, intracellular AI-2 synthetic routes were outlined and environmental influences on AI-2 production were focused. Furthermore, recent advances in AI-2 detection and quantification were elucidated from an overall perspective. An in-depth understanding of mechanisms and features of various detection methods may facilitate development of new technologies aimed at signal molecule detection. Finally, utilization of AI-2 mediated QS in health improvement, water treatment and drug production indicate promising and extensive application perspectives of QS strategies.

AB Tsukamurella sp. strain MH1, capable to use a wide range of n-alkanes as the only carbon source, was isolated from petroleum-contaminated soil (Pitesti, Romania) and its complete genome was sequenced. The 4,922,396 bp genome contains only one circular chromosome with a G + C content of 71.12%, much higher than the type strains of this genus (68.4%). Based on the 16S rRNA genes sequence similarity, strain MH1 was taxonomically identified as Tsukamurella carboxydivorans. Genome analyses revealed that strain MH1 is harboring only one gene encoding for the alkB-like hydroxylase, arranged in a complete alkane monooxygenase operon. This is the first complete genome of the specie T. carboxydivorans, which will provide insights into the potential of Tsukamurella sp. MH1 and related strains for bioremediation of petroleum hydrocarbons-contaminated sites and into the environmental role of these bacteria.

AB Non-destructive approaches based on the application of optical spectroscopy are important for monitoring carotenoid accumulation in a whole cell cultured under various conditions. A simple and rapid assay utilizing aerial microalgae helps to identify stress conditions that can efficiently enhance the carotenogenesis in photosynthetic organisms. The spectra of cell suspensions were characterized in the aerial microalga Coelastrella sp. KGU-Y002, which are unicellular and undifferentiated. Total carotenoid contents could be successfully estimated on the basis of the absorbance values of the cell suspensions and calibration data analyzed by HPLC (high-performance liquid chromatography). A novel screening method, the so-called "whole-cell-based screening method" for carotenoid assays (WCA), was developed based on this procedure. It was possible to investigate the effects of various stresses on carotenoid accumulation in the aerial microalga by adapting this bioassay to a 96-well microtiter plate. When bioactive compounds were screened from our library of plant extracts using this method, an active compound was identified from the plant extract.

AB Acetic acid, a potential growth inhibitor, commonly occurs in lignocellulosic hydrolysates. The growth of Cupriavidus necator DSM 545 and production of poly(3-hydroxybutyrate) (PHB) by this bacterium in a glucose-based medium supplemented with various initial concentrations of acetic acid are reported. The bacterium could use both glucose and acetic acid to grow and produce PHB, but acetic acid inhibited growth once its initial concentration exceeded 0.5 g/L. As acetic acid is an unavoidable contaminant in hydrolysates used as sugar sources in commercial fermentations, a mathematical model was developed to describe its impact on growth and the production of PHB. The model was shown to satisfactorily apply to growth and PHB production data obtained in media made with acetic-acid-containing hydrolysates of Napier grass and oil palm trunk as carbon substrates.

AB Galium verum, also known as Lady's Bedstraw or Cheese Rennet, is an herbaceous perennial plant traditionally used in cheese-making. We used RACE PCR to isolate novel enzymes from Galium verum with the ability to clot milk. This approach generated two cDNA sequences (named preprogaline A and B) encoding proteins displaying the typical plant aspartic protease primary structure. Preprogaline B was expressed in the yeast Pichia pastoris, after deleting and replacing its original signal peptide with the yeast a-factor signal peptide from Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The secreted recombinant protein was obtained by growing P. pastoris in YPD medium and had the ability to clot milk. The mature form of progaline B is a heterodimeric glycosylated enzyme, with a molecular weight of approximately 48 kDa, that contains a heavy (30.7 kDa) and a light (13.5 kDa) polypeptide chains linked by disulfide bonds. Western blot analysis revealed that progaline B is activated by the acidification of the yeast culture medium and that enzymatic activation requires two steps. First the precursor protein is cleaved into two polypeptide chains by partial removal of the plant-specific insert (PSI) present in plant aspartic proteases; this is later followed by propeptide removal. By altering the pH of the P. pastoris culture medium, we were able to obtain either active or inactive forms of the enzyme. Recombinant progaline B displayed a.-casein hydrolysis pattern analogous to those produced by the animal and microbial coagulants currently used in the dairy industry, but it exhibited a different digestion profile on alpha- and beta-caseins.

AB Buffers are essential for diluting bacterial cultures for flow cytometry analysis in order to study bacterial physiology and gene expression parameters based on fluorescence signals. Using a variety of constitutively expressed fluorescent proteins in Escherichia coli K-12 strain MG1655, we found strong artifactual changes in fluorescence levels after dilution into the commonly used flow cytometry buffer phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and two other buffer solutions, Tris-HCl and M9 salts. These changes appeared very rapidly after dilution, and were linked to increased membrane permeability and loss in cell viability. We observed buffer-related effects in several different E. coli strains, K-12, C and W, but not E. coli B, which can be partially explained by differences in lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and outer membrane composition. Supplementing the buffers with divalent cations responsible for outer membrane stability, Mg2+ and Ca2+, preserved fluorescence signals, membrane integrity and viability of E. coli. Thus, stabilizing the bacterial outer membrane is essential for precise and unbiased measurements of fluorescence parameters using flow cytometry.

AB Brewer's spent grain (BSG) accounts for around 85% of the solid by-products from beer production. BSG was first extracted to obtain water-soluble arabinoxylan (AX). Using subsequent alkali extraction (0.5 M KOH) it was possible to dissolve additional AX. In total, about 57% of the AX in BSG was extracted with the purity of 45-55%. After comparison of nine xylanases, Pentopan mono BG, a GH11 enzyme, was selected for hydrolysis of the extracts to oligosaccharides with minimal formation of monosaccharides. Growth of Bifidobacterium adolescentis (ATCC 15703) was promoted by the enzymatic hydrolysis to arabinoxylooligosaccharides, while Lactobacillus brevis (DSMZ 1264) utilized only unsubstituted xylooligosaccharides. Furthermore, utilization of the hydrolysates by human gut microbiota was also assessed in a batch human fecal fermentation model. Results revealed that the rates of fermentation of the BSG hydrolysates by human gut microbiota were similar to that of commercial prebiotic fructooligosaccharides, while inulin was fermented at a slower rate. In summary, a sustainable process to valorize BSG to functional food ingredients has been proposed.

AB The Stetter reaction, a conjugate umpolung reaction, is well known for cyanide-catalyzed transformations of mostly aromatic aldehydes. Enzymatic Stetter reactions, however, have been largely unexplored, especially with respect to preparative transformations. We have investigated the kinetics of the MenD-catalyzed 1,4-addition of a-ketoglutaric acid to acrylonitrile which has shown that acrylonitrile, while an interesting candidate, is a poor substrate for MenD due to low affinity of the enzyme for this substrate. The kinetic model of the reaction was simplified to double substrate Michaelis-Menten kinetics where the reaction rate linearly depends on acrylonitrile concentration. Experiments at different initial concentrations of acrylonitrile under batch, repetitive batch, and fed-batch reactor conditions were carried out to validate the developed mathematical model. Thiamine diphosphate dependent MenD proved to be quite a robust enzyme; nevertheless, enzyme operational stability decay occurs in the reactor. The spontaneous reactivity of acrylonitrile towards polymerization was also taken into account during mathematical modeling. Almost quantitative conversion of acrylonitrile was achieved in all batch reactor experiments, while the yield of the desired product was dependent on initial acrylonitrile concentration (i.e., the concentration of the stabilizer additive). Using the optimized reactor parameters, it was possible to synthesize the product, 6-cyano-4-oxohexanoic acid, in a concentration of 250 mM. The highest concentration of product was achieved in a repetitive batch reactor experiment. A fed-batch reactor experiment also delivered promising results, especially regarding the short reaction time needed to achieve a 200 mM concentration of product. Hence, the enzymatic Stetter reaction with a highly reactive acceptor substrate can be performed on a preparative scale, which should enable similar transformations with acrylate, methacrylate, and methyl vinyl ketone.

   Sequencing; Novel mutation
AB Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD; MIM 310200) is one of the most common and severe type of hereditary muscular dystrophies. The disease is caused by mutations in the dystrophin gene. The dystrophin gene is associated with X-linked recessive Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophy. This disease occurs almost exclusively in males. The clinical symptoms of muscle weakness usually begin at childhood. The main symptoms of this disorder are gradually muscular weakness. The affected patients have inability to standing up and walking. Death is usually due to respiratory infection or cardiomyopathy. In this article, we have reported the discovery of a new nonsense mutation that creates abnormal stop codon in the dystrophin gene. This mutation was detected using Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) technique. The subject was a 17-year-old male with muscular dystrophy that who was suspected of having DMD. He was referred to Hakim medical genetics center of Neyshabur, IRAN.

AB Repetitive DNA plays a fundamental role in the organization, size and evolution of eukaryotic genomes. The sequencing of the turbot revealed a small and compact genome, as in all flatfish studied to date. The assembly of repetitive regions is still incomplete because it is difficult to correctly identify their position, number and array. The combination of classical cytogenetic techniques along with high quality sequencing is essential to increase the knowledge of the structure and composition of these sequences and, thus, of the structure and function of the whole genome. In this work, the in silico analysis of HI. histone, 5S rDNA, telomeric and Rex repetitive sequences, was compared to their chromosomal mapping by fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH), providing a more comprehensive picture of these elements in the turbot genome. FISH assays confirmed the location of H1 in LG8; 5S rDNA in LG4 and LG6; telomeric sequences at the end of all chromosomes whereas Rex elements were dispersed along most chromosomes. The discrepancies found between both approaches could be related to the sequencing methodology applied in this species and also to the resolution limitations of the FISH technique. Turbot cytogenomic analyses have proven to add new chromosomal landmarks in the karyotype of this species, representing a powerful tool to investigate targeted genomic sequences or regions in the genetic and physical maps of this species.

AB Osteoarthritis (OA) is a widely prevalent degenerative joint disease characterized by articular cartilage degradation and joint inflammation. The pathogenesis of OA remains unclear, leading to a lack of effective treatment. Previous studies have reported that circular RNAs (circRNAs) are involved in the development of various diseases. However, the function of circRNAs and their roles in OA is largely unknown. Therefore, we aimed to investigate changes in circRNA expression and predict their functions in OA by using bioinformatics analysis. An OA model was established in mouse articular chondrocytes (MACs) treated by interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta), and then the circRNA profile was screened by Next Generation Sequencing. By comparing circRNA expression in IL-1 beta-treated MACs and normal controls, differentially expressed circRNAs were identified during OA pathogenesis, and differential expression levels of selected circRNAs were validated by qRT-PCR. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analyses were employed to predict the functions of these circRNAs. Because circRNAs can act as "miRNA sponges", we also constructed a circRNA-miRNA network to predict their functions. A total of 255 circRNAs were found to be differentially expressed in IL-1 beta-treated MACs (p <= 0.05; fold-change >= 2) from the expression of the normal controls. Among them, 119 circRNAs were significantly up-regulated, and the other 136 were down-regulated. Seven circRNAs were randomly selected to verify the reliability of these profiles by quantitative qRT-PCR. After obtaining the parental genes of differentially expressed circRNA, the top 30 enrichment GO entries and KEGG pathways were annotated. Then, two significantly differentially expressed circRNAs (mmu-circRNA-30365 and mmu-circRNA-36866) were identified and selected for further analysis, meanwhile a circRNA-miRNA regulation network was created and the top five most likely functional-related target miRNAs of the circRNAs were collected. Although the exact mechanisms and biological functions of these circRNAs in the development of OA need further exploration, our findings do suggest that the differentially expressed circRNAs were involved in the pathogenesis of OA. Thus, our study brings us closer to understanding the pathogenic mechanisms and finding new molecular targets for the clinical treatment of osteoarthritis.

AB N-terminal acetylation is a highly abundant and important protein modification in eukaryotes catalyzed by N-terminal acetyltransferases (NATs). In humans, six different NATs have been identified (NatA-NatF), each composed of individual subunits and acetylating a distinct set of substrates. Along with most NATs, NatC acts co-translationally at the ribosome. The NatC complex consists of the catalytic subunit Naa30 and the auxiliary subunits Naa35 and Naa38, and can potentially Nt-acetylate cytoplasmic proteins when the initiator methionine is followed by a bulky hydrophobic/amphipathic residue at position 2. Here, we have identified a splice variant of human NAA30, which encodes a truncated protein named Naa30(288). The splice variant was abundantly present in thyroid cancer tissues and in several different human cancer cell lines. Surprisingly, Naa30(288) localized predominantly to the nucleus, as opposed to annotated Naa30 which has a cytoplasmic localization. Full-length Naa30 acetylated a classical NatC substrate peptide in vitro, whereas no significant NAT activity was detected for Naa30(288). Due to the nuclear localization, we also examined acetyltransferase activity towards lysine residues. Neither full-length Naa30 nor Naa30(288) displayed any lysine acetyltransferase activity. Overexpression of full-length Naa30 increased cell viability via inhibition of apoptosis. In contrast, Naa30(288) did not exert an anti-apoptotic effect. In sum, we identified a novel and widely expressed Naa30 isoform with a potential non-catalytic role in the nucleus.

AB The complete exploration of the regulation of gene expression remains one of the top-priority goals for researchers. As the regulation is mainly controlled at the level of transcription by promoters, study on promoters and findings are of great importance. This review summarizes forty selected databases that centralize experimental and theoretical knowledge regarding the organization of promoters, interacting transcription factors (TFs) and microRNAs (miRNAs) in many eukaryotic and prokaryotic species. The presented databases offer researchers valuable support in elucidating the regulation of gene transcription.

AB Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a common autosomal recessive neuromuscular disorder that is mostly caused by homozygous deletion of the SMN1 gene. Approximately 5%-10% of SMA patients are believed to have SMN1 variants. c.22 dupA (p.Ser8lysfs*23) has been identified as the most frequent variant in the Chinese SMA population and to be associated with a severe phenotype. However, the exact molecular mechanism of the variant on the pathogenesis of SMA is unclear. We observed that SMN1 mRNA and the SMN protein in the peripheral blood cells of a patient with c.22 dupA were lower than those of controls. The aim of this study is to investigate whether nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) plays a role in the mechanism of the c.22 dupA variant of the SMN1 gene as it causes SMA. Two lymphoblasts cell lines from two patients (patient 1 and 2) with the c.22 dupA, and one dermal fibroblasts cell line from patient 2 were included in our study. Two-stage validation of the NMD mechanism was supplied. We first measured the changes in the transcript levels of the SMN1 gene by real-time quantitative PCR after immortalized B-lymphoblasts and dermal fibroblasts cells of the SMA patients were treated with inhibitors of the NMD pathway, including puromycin and cyclohemide. Next, lentivirus-mediated knockdown of the key NMD factor-Up-frameshift protein 1 (UPF1)-was performed in the fibroblasts cell line to further clarify whether the variant led to NMD, as UPF1 recognizes abnormally terminated transcripts as NMD substrates during translation. SC35 1.7-kb transcripts, a physiological NMD substrate was determined to be a NMD positive gene in our experiments. The two inhibitors resulted in a dramatic escalation of the levels of the full-length SMN1 (ft-SMN1) transcripts. Additionally, the SC35 1.7-kb mRNA levels were also increased, suggesting that NMD pathway is suppressed by the two inhibitors. For the 3 cell lines, the fold increase of the SMN1 transcript levels of cycloheximide ranged from 2.5 +/- 0.4 to 8.3 +/- 0.1, 1.9 +/- 0.2 to 5.0 +/- 0.7 and 2.2 +/- 0.1 to 4.9 +/- 0.2 for two lymphoblastoid cell lines and one fibroblasts cell line, respectively. For these cell lines, the fold increases of the SMN1 transcript levels of puromycin were as follows: 5.5 +/- 0.2 to 19.5 +/- 4.0, 3.1 +/- 0.3 to 9.9 +/- 1.8 and 1.5 +/- 0.2 to 6.5 +/- 0.5. Meanwhile, the SC35 1.7-kb transcript levels were markedly increased in all 3 cell lines. In addition, lentivirus-mediated UPF1 knockdown lead to a reduction of the UPF1 protein level to 22.5% compared to the negative control lentivirus. Additionally, knockdown of the UPF1 gene also promoted mRNA expression of the SC35 1.7kb and fl-SMN1 genes. The increases of the SMN1 and SC35 1.7-kb mRNA levels reached about 4- and 6.5-fold in fibroblasts derived from the patient 2, respectively. Altogether, our study provides the first evidence that the c.22 dupA variant in the SMN1 gene triggers NMD. SMA pathogenesis in the patient is associated with mRNA degradation of SMN1, but not the truncated SMN protein.

AB Luteolin is a flavonoid compound derived from Lonicera japonica Thunb, which has been reported to exert anticancer effects on different types of tumors. miRNAs are a kind of endogenous non-coding small RNAs, which involved in occurrence and development of multi cancer, including miR-34a. However, the relationship between miR-34a and luteolin's susceptibility to cancer cells still remains unclear. In this study, we explored the roles of miR-34a and the effects of luteolin on GC cells as well as the underlying mechanism of miR-34a in mediating the susceptibility of GC cell to luteolin. Retrospectively study revealed that miR-34a expression was downregulated in human primary GC tissues compared with non-tumor tissues and low miR-34a expression was associated with a significantly shorter overall survival and disease-free survival. MiR-34a overexpression could inhibit GC cells and induce G1 phase arrest via p53/p21 and MAPK/ERK pathways. Luteolin decreased viability of GC cells in a dose-dependent manner. Meanwhile, miR-34a was found to be markedly upregulated in GC cells induced by luteolin and decreased miR-34a level was found in the artificial luteolin-resistant GC cells. Upregulation of miR-34a in luteolin-resistant GC cell could enhance the sensibility of GC cells to luteolin. On the other hand, miR-34a inhibitor could partly counter the anticancer effect of luteolin. In a further assay, we also found that targeting miR-34a could mediate the susceptibility of mouse xenografts to luteolin. Subsequent study found that HK1 was a direct target of miR-34a and downregulated HK1 mRNA or protein levels were presented after miRNA-34a overexpression in GC cells. Moreover, HK1 protein levels was decreased after luteolin treatment and partly restored when co-treated with luteolin and miR-34a inhibitor. Downregulation of HK1 in luteolin-resistant GC cell could increase the cell's sensitivity to luteolin. Therefore, our findings firstly suggested that miR-34a could modulate the susceptibility of gastric cancer cell to luteolin via targeting HK1, potentially benefiting GC patients' treatment in the future.

AB Rectal cancer involves one-third of colorectal cancers (CRCs). Recently, data supported that DNA methylation have a role in CRC pathogenesis. In the present study we aimed to analyze the methylation status of MGMT and ERCC1 promoter regions in blood and tissue of patients with benign and malignant rectal tumors. We also studied the methylated MGMT and ERCC1 genes and their relations with clinicopathological features. Furthermore, we suggested that methylation may play a critical function in the regulation of MGMT and ERCC1 expression.
   Fifty patients with non-metastatic cancer rectum and 43 patients with benign rectal lesions were involved in the study. DNA extraction from blood and rectal specimens was done to analyze the methylation status of MGMT and ERCC1 genes by methylation-specific PCR method. RNA was extracted also to determine the expression levels of these genes by real time-PCR.
   The frequency of MGMT and ERCC1 methylation was significantly higher in rectum cancers than in benign tumors both for the tissue and the blood (p < 0.001). There was no relation between MGMT or ERCC1 methylation and clinicopathological features; while they were correlated with the response to therapy. An interesting finding that the agreement of the methylation levels in the blood and rectal tissue was classified as good kappa = 0.78) for MGMT gene and as very good (kappa = 0.85) for ERCC1. Lastly, the MGMT and ERCC1 genes methylation was associated with down-regulation of their mRNA expression when compared with the non-methylated status.
   Our findings provided evidence that both blood and tumor tissue MGMT and ERCC1 methylation were associated with cancer rectum. MGMT or ERCC1 methylation in blood could be suitable non-invasive biomarkers differentiating benign and malignant rectal tumors. Furthermore, the methylation of the MGMT and ERCC1 promoter regions was associated with down-regulation of their mRNA expression.

AB SLIT2 is a candidate tumor suppressor gene and recent studies have shown that SLIT2 expression is suppressed or reduced by hypermethylation in the promoter region in various cancers. The aim of this study was to investigate the association between SLIT2 promoter methylation and nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) and its relative diagnostic ability for NPC. Bisulfite pyrosequencing technology was performed to measure methylation levels of the SLIT2 promoter in tissue and plasma samples from 61 NPC patients and 38 normal volunteers. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and area under the curve (AUC) were used to evaluate the diagnostic ability of SLIT2 methylation for diagnosing NPC. Our results showed that methylation levels of the SLIT2 promoter were significantly higher in NPC patients compared with individuals, both in tissue samples (P = 2.57E - 10) and plasma samples (plasma: P = 3.86E - 13). In addition, the frequency of SLIT2 promoter methylation markedly increased in the advanced stage (tissue: P = 3.50E - 05; plasma: P = 1.14E - 04) and advanced T classified (tissue: P = 9.00E - 06; plasma: P = 3.80E - 05), as well as in lymph node metastasis patients (tissue: P = 1.82E - 03; plasma: P = 2.22E - 03). In addition, the AUCs according to tissue and plasma samples were 0.846 and 0.866, respectively. When these two sample-types were combined, the AUC increased slightly to 0.874. Our study revealed that elevated SLIT2 promoter methylation contributed to the risk of NPC, as well as being involved in its progression and metastasis. Therefore, the methylated SLIT2 promoter could serve as a potential biomarker for diagnosing NPC.

AB A Drug Response Prediction (DRP) score was developed based on gene expression profiling (GEP) from cell lines and tumor samples. Twenty percent of high-risk patients by GEP70 treated in Total Therapy 2 and 3A have a progression-free survival (PFS) of more than 10 years. We used available GEP data from high-risk patients by GEP70 at diagnosis from Total Therapy 2 and 3A to predict the response by the DRP score of drugs used in the treatment of myeloma patients. The DRP score stratified patients further. High-risk myeloma with a predicted sensitivity to melphalan by the DRP score had a prolonged PFS, HR = 2.4 (1.2-4.9, P = 0.014) and those with predicted sensitivity to bortezomib had a HR 5.7 (1.2-27, P = 0.027). In case of predicted sensitivity to bortezomib, a better response to treatment was found (P = 0.022). This method may provide us with a tool for identifying candidates for effective personalized medicine and spare potential non-responders from suffering toxicity.

AB Previous studies focus on developing high sensitive PCR-related technologies to detect EGFR gene mutation in malignant pleural effusion (MPE) of non-small cell lung cancer patient (NSCLC) instead of improving the quality of clinical samples themselves. We therefore hypothesized that the enrichment of tumor cells in MPE could improve the quality of MPE for the more accurate detection of EGFR gene mutation in the patients with NSCLC. MPE were collected from 28 patients with NSCLC. The tumor cells in MPE were firstly enriched by the depletion of leukocytes with bi-antibodies and identified by multiple flow cytometry. CastPCR was performed to detect the deletions in exon 19 (DelEGFR19) and point mutations in 20 (T790M, c.2369C > T) and 21 (L858R, c.2573 T > G) of EGFR. All the detected mutations were confirmed their presence by Sanger sequencing. Before enrichment, the tumor cells in MPE were detected in 46.4% (13/28) of samples and the median value of the percentage of the tumor cells was only 0.64% including 3 (10.7%, 3/28) of samples more than 10% on it. After enrichment, the tumor cells were detected in all samples (100%) and the median value of the percentage of tumor cells was increased to 40.8% including only one (3.6%, 1/28) less than 10% on it. EGFR gene mutations were detected in 28.6% (8/28) and 42.9% (12/28) of the samples before and after enrichment, respectively. The sensitivity on the detection rate was relatively increased by 44.4%. Moreover, the mutations can be confirmed their presence by Sanger sequencing in 6 samples before enrichment (75%, 6/8) and 11 samples (91.7%, 11/12) after enrichment. It is valuable to improve the quality of the sample by the enrichment of the tumor cells from MPE for the following genetic analysis.

AB Aim The present study was conducted to determine the effect of FOXP3 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on clinical outcomes in CsA-treated renal transplant patients.
   Methods: A total of 166 renal transplant patients with at least 5 years of follow-up were included. SNPs of FOXP3 gene (rs3761547, rs3761548, rs3761549, rs2232365 and rs2280883) were detected by Taqman probe technique. The associations of SNPs with acute rejection, CsA-induced nephrotoxicity, pneumonia and post-transplantation estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) were explored.
   Results: Patients with rs3761549 T/TT genotype showed a more rapid decline in the eGFR level during the 5 years following transplantation than those with the C/CC genotype (24.0% vs. 6.3%, P = 0.004). All the SNPs and site-site interaction were not related to the occurrence of acute rejection, nephrotoxicity, and pneumonia.
   Conclusions: FOXP3 rs3761549 was significantly correlated with the renal allograft function. It could be used to predict and improve the outcome of renal transplant patients taking CsA as an immunosuppressant.

TI Metabolic syndrome alters expression of insulin signaling-related genes
   in swine mesenchymal stem cells
SO GENE
LA English
DT Article
DE Mesenchymal stem cells; Insulin; Metabolic syndrome; mRNA
ID DIET-INDUCED OBESITY; RESISTANCE; OUTCOMES
AB Aims: Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is associated with insulin resistance (IR) and impaired glucose metabolism in muscle, fat, and other cells, and may induce inflammation and vascular remodeling. Endogenous reparative systems, including adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSC), are responsible for repair of damaged tissue. MSC have also been proposed as an exogenous therapeutic intervention in patients with cardiovascular and chronic kidney disease (CKD). The feasibility of using autologous cells depends on their integrity, but whether in MetS IR involves adipose tissue-derived MSC remains unknown. The aim of this study was to examine the expression of mRNA involved in insulin signaling in MSC from subjects with MetS.
   Methods: Domestic pigs consumed a lean or obese diet (n = 6 each) for 16 weeks. MSC were collected from subcutaneous abdominal fat and analyzed using high-throughput RNA-sequencing for expression of genes involved in insulin signaling. Expression profiles for enriched (fold change > 1.4, p < 0.05) and suppressed (fold change < 0.7, p < 0.05) mRNAs in MetS pigs were functionally interpreted by gene ontology analysis. The most prominently upregulated and downregulated mRNAs were further probed.
   Results: We identified in MetS-MSC 168 up-regulated and 51 down-regulated mRNAs related to insulin signaling. Enriched mRNAs were implicated in biological pathways including hepatic glucose metabolism, adipocyte differentiation, and transcription regulation, and down-regulated mRNAs in intracellular calcium signaling and cleaving peptides. Functional analysis suggested that overall these alterations could increase IR.
   Conclusions: MetS alters mRNA expression related to insulin signaling in adipose tissue-derived MSC. These observations mandate caution during administration of autologous MSC in subjects with MetS.

AB Bovine herpesvirus-1 (BHV-1) is a major viral pathogen affecting bovines leading to various clinical manifestations and causes significant economic impediment in modern livestock production system. Rapid, accurate and sensitive detection of BHV-1 infection at frozen semen stations or at dairy herds remains a priority for control of BHV-1 spread to susceptible population. Polymerase Spiral Reaction (PSR), a novel addition in the gamut of isothermal techniques, has been successfully implemented in initial optimization for detection of BHV-1 genomic DNA and further validated in clinical samples. The developed PSR assay has been validated for detection of BHV1 from bovine semen (n = 99), a major source of transmission of BHV-1 from breeding bulls to susceptible dams in artificial insemination programs. The technique has also been used for screening of BHV-1 DNA from suspected aborted fetal tissues (n = 25). The developed PSR technique is 100 fold more sensitive than conventional PCR and comparable to real-time PCR. The PSR technique has been successful in detecting 13 samples positive for BHV-1 DNA in bovine semen, 4 samples more than conventional PCR. The aborted fetal tissues were negative for presence of BHV-1 DNA. The presence of BHV-1 in bovine semen samples raises a pertinent concern for extensively screening of semen from breeding bulls before been used for artificial insemination process. PSR has all the attributes for becoming a method of choice for rapid, accurate and sensitive detection of BHV-1 DNA at frozen semen stations or at dairy herds in resource constrained settings.

AB This study is aimed to investigate the potential role of interleukin (IL)-33 in transplanted kidney interstitial fibrosis and the associated mechanism. Serum IL-33 levels were detected using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in healthy volunteers, stable kidney transplantation recipients (KTRs) (stable), KTRs with acute rejection (AR), and KTRs with chronic allograft dysfunction (CAD) (CAD). Immunohistochemical (IHC) staining, Western blotting, and quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) were used to detect the expression of IL-33 in human kidney tissues obtained from control and CAD patients. In addition, human kidney (HK)-2 cells were treated with human IL-33 at different doses or intervals, and the markers of epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) were assessed by the presence of proteins and mRNA extracted from these cells using Western blotting and qRT-PCR. Cell motility and migration were evaluated with a cell motility and migration assay. The mechanism involved in EMT induced by IL-33 was investigated by Western blot. Finally, fibronectin, E-cadherin, and alpha-SMA expression, as well as the level of activity in the MAPK signaling pathway in the kidney tissues from the control and CAD group were also detected using a Western blot and an IHC staining assay. The intensity of fibrosis was substantially higher in the CAD group. IL-33 was significantly upregulated in the CAD patients compared to the control group. In vitro, IL-33 could induce EMT in a dose-dependent and time-dependent manner and promoted both the cellular motility and migration capabilities of HK-2 cells. Moreover, the p38 MAPK signaling pathway might be involved in the pathogenesis of EMT induced by IL-33, which was consistent with the in vivo results of the kidney specimens from the control and CAD patients. IL-33 was upregulated in CAD patients and could promote EMT of HK-2 cells.

AB The Erb-b2 receptor tyrosine kinase 3 (ERBB3) belongs to a family of epidermal growth factor receptors of protein tyrosine kinases, and regulates cell survival, differentiation and proliferation in several cell types. Previous studies have suggested that ERBB3 contributes to T1DM pathogenesis by modulating antigen presenting cell function, autoimmunity and cytokine-induced beta-cell apoptosis. Accordingly, some genome-wide association studies identified ERBB3 gene as a susceptibility locus for T1DM, with the strongest association signal being observed for the rs292239 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in intron 7 of the gene. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to replicate the association of the ERBB3 rs2292239 SNP with T1DM in a Brazilian population. We analyzed 421 T1DM patients (cases) and 510 nondiabetic subjects (controls). All subjects were self-declared as white. The ERBB3 rs2292239 (A/C) SNP was genotyped by real-time PCR using TaqMan MGB probes. Genotype (P = 0.001) and allele (P = 0.002) frequencies of the ERBB3 rs2292239 SNP were differently distributed between T1DM patients and nondiabetic controls. Moreover, the A allele was significantly associated with risk for T1DM when considering recessive (OR = 1.58, 95% CI 1.11-2.27; P = 0.015), additive (OR = 1.78, 95% CI 1.21-2.62; P = 0.004), and dominant (OR = 1.39, 95% CI 1.07-1.81; P = 0.016) models of inheritance. However, after adjustment for presence of high-risk HLA DR/DQ genotypes, the rs2292239 SNP remained independently associated with T1DM only for the additive model (OR = 1.62, 95% CI 1.02-2.59; P = 0.043). Our results suggest that the A/A genotype of the ERBB3 rs2292239 SNP is associated with risk for T1DM in a white Brazilian population.

AB Dyslipidemia is one of the common metabolic disorders in Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS). Proprotein convertase subtilisin kexin type 9 (PCSK9) is a new component of lipid metabolism and correlated to the development of dyslipidemia and atherosclerosis. This protein acts by preventing the recycling of LDL receptors (LDL-r) back to the cell surface and thus generates higher levels of LDLc. The objective of this study was to evaluate the PCSK9 polymorphisms rs505151 (c.2009A > G), rs562556 (c.1420A > G) and rs11206510 (T > C) and plasma PCSK9 levels in PCOS. A group of women with PCOS (n = 97), and a group of healthy women (control, n = 99) were selected. Biochemical parameters were determined by using Vitros system and polymorphisms were assessed by TaqMan SNP Genotyping Assays. Plasma PCSK9 levels or PCSK9 polymorphisms were not associated with PCOS. The genotype rs11206510TT was associated with higher levels of PCSK9 in both groups. The population investigated (PCOS + control groups) with the rs505151AA genotype presented higher HDLc levels. The GG genotype regarding rs562556 polymorphism was associated with higher HDLc in PCOS group, while the AA genotype carriers had higher plasma testosterone levels when evaluated all women in a same group. The results were the same by comparing recessive and dominant model despite PCOS or both groups altogether. Our results suggest that PCSK9 is not altered specifically in PCOS, but it could be associated with in lipid and androgen metabolism in Brazilian women.

AB Eggplant (Solanum melongena) is a major vegetable crop worldwide. However, it is susceptible to bacterial wilt (BW) caused by Ralstonia solanacearurn, which has become an important factor limiting eggplant yield and quality. The underlying mechanism of BW remains unknown. Here, RNA-sequencing was used to characterize the transcriptomes of resistant (R) and susceptible (S) strains before (R0, S0) and after (R1, S1) R. solanacearum inoculation. After the removal of low-quality sequences and assembly, 125,852 contigs, 122,508 transcripts, and 68,792 unigenes were identified, with 51,165 non-redundant unigenes annotated. Functional annotations were provided for 11,039 unigenes using four databases (NCBI Nr, Swissprot, KEGG and COG database). A total of 1137 and 9048 genes were found to be up- and down-regulated, respectively, in R0 relative to R1 samples, with 738 and 217 up- and down-regulated in S0 relative to R0 samples, 6087 and 5832 up- and down-regulated in S0 relative to S1 samples, and 4712 and 12,523 up- and down-regulated in Si relative to R1 samples, respectively. In conclusion, our results provide useful insights into the potential mechanism of BW and are an important basis for further analysis.

AB The aim of the present study is to investigate the effect of higher alcohols with Calophyllum Inophyllum biodiesel on the diesel engine characteristics under various engine loads. Two higher alcohols have been identified for the present investigation namely 1-pentanol and 1-butanol and the six fuel samples have been prepared with Calophyllum Inophyllum biodiesel at 40%, 50% and 60% concentrations by volume. All the experiments are carried out in a single cylinder, four stroke and constant speed diesel engine and the experimental results are compared with conventional diesel and pure biodiesel fuels. The study revealed that the diesel engine operation with higher alcohol-biodiesel blends has shown lower brake thermal efficiency and higher brake specific fuel consumption. The reduction rate is higher with a higher concentration of alcohol in the fuel blends. On the other hand, the cooling effect of higher alcohol in the blend reduces the NOx emission due to their higher latent heat of vaporization. Moreover, the CO, HC and smoke emissions are decreased for all higher alcohol-biodiesel blends. The combustion characteristics are followed similar pattern for all tested fuels and peak pressure is comparatively lower for higher concentration of alcohol in the fuel blend. Finally, it is revealed that 1-pentanol and 1-butanol can be successfully used as partial substitute to diesel or biodiesel fuel.

AB The sustainable development of offshore wind energy requires thorough investigations on technological issues. The substructure, which acts as the natural link between technologies and environments, is a critical topic for the offshore wind industry. This paper presents a comprehensive review of variable types of offshore wind substructures associate with their corresponding example projects. The study is complemented with a special attention to a novel foundation, namely suction bucket foundation. Main technological issues related to this concept are integrated. In the paper, bearing behaviors of offshore wind turbines (OWTs) with the suction bucket foundation under lateral loads, vertical loads, combined loads, and extreme loading conditions are discussed. Two installation methods are introduced. The geometric and improved design is illustrated by considering capabilities in transportation and installation. Research methods, including field tests, laboratory tests, centrifuge tests, theoretical analysis and numerical simulations, are listed; these methods are employed in previous studies to investigate behaviors of the OWT. This review integrates most relevant aspects and recent advancements together, which aims to provide a reference frame for future studies and projects.

AB The current study aimed to investigate catalytic behaviors of alkali metal salt participating in homogeneous steam-volatile and heterogeneous steam-char reforming reactions in steam gasification of cellulose. The results indicate that the temperature is a key parameter which significantly influenced both yield and composition of gas and tar and catalytic performances of KCl. Externally added steam had negligible effect on cracking/reforming of macromolecules volatiles at the temperature of 700 and 900 degrees C without KCl, whereas in the presence of KCl, it would be activated and further reacted with low reactivity macromolecules volatiles, leading to an increase in gas yield and a decrease in tar yield. KCl was notably involved in homogeneous steam-volatile reactions, and enhanced the water gas shift reaction and tar reforming reactions. However, KCl had little promotion effect on thermal cracking/reforming of levoglucosan in homogeneous steam-volatile reforming process at 500 degrees C. Its inhibition effect on levoglucosan formation mainly acted during the primary pyrolysis reactions. KCl could also enhance heterogeneous in situ char-steam reaction resulting in a higher H-2 yield. The general pathway of KCl involved in homogeneous/heterogeneous reactions in steam gasification of biomass was eventually proposed.

AB Gasification-based char from a commercial small-scale gasification plant was converted into an acidic catalyst for methanolysis of waste cooking oil (WCO). The char-based acidic catalyst was synthesized by the sulfonation of gasification char with sulfuric acid. Functional groups, acid density, morphological and surface properties were characterized and measured by using Fourier transform infrared red spectroscopy, ammonia temperature programmed desorption, field emission scanning electron microscope and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller, respectively. Wood char based acid catalyst showed higher surface area of 337 m(2)/g and acid density of 2.94 mmol/g. The reaction variables such as methanol/oil molar ratio, catalyst loading, reaction time and temperature, were studied. The optimum reaction conditions, 9:1 methanol/oil ratio, 6 wt% catalyst loadincxg, 130 min reaction time at 65 degrees C, gave 96% of ester conversion. The recovered catalyst was washed and reused without any activation (calcination), still giving 81% of ester conversion after five reaction cycles. Furthermore, fuel properties of WCO methyl esters were determined as per the ASTM and EN biodiesel standards. The utilization of char from biomass gasification for the synthesis of an acid catalyst for biodiesel production allows achieving a twofold objective. On the one side, the valorization of a material which is presently wasted. On the other side, the production of a catalyst that can effectively convert WCO into biodiesel in a single step process, therefore allowing a simplified procedure and lower operational temperatures. In addition, the obtained catalyst showed an interesting efficiency in decreasing free fatty acid of WCO and a considerable recyclability of the catalyst.

Fermentative sugars and amino acids can be obtained after suitable pretreatment and hydrolysis of algae. However, binary interactions between the carbonyl group (-C=O) in sugars and the amino group (-NH2) in amino acids possibly occur during thermal pretreatment, resulting in deficient hydrolysis and fermentation performance. In this study, algae-derived glucose and glycine as model substrates were subjected to thermochemical treatment (135 degrees C for 15 min) under neutral, acid and alkaline conditions to assess their decomposition routes and the associated implications on sequential biohydrogen and biomethane fermentation. Acid treatment mainly resulted in direct decomposition of glucose into 5-methylfurfural (C6H6O2, 34.4% of peak area). While thermal treatment with deionized water and alkaline led to the formation of nitrogen-containing Maillard compounds, namely 1-azido-4-climethylaminobenzene (C8H10N4, 331%) and 2,3,5-trimethylpyrazine (C7H10N2, 49.0%), respectively. Untreated glucose/glycine yielded a biohydrogen production of 171.9 mL/g, while alkaline treatment exhibited a biohydrogen yield of only 5.9 mL/g due to the great loss of fermentable substrate. The total energy conversion efficiency (ECE) of 71.1% was achieved through the second-stage biomethane fermentation of untreated glucose/glycine. Comparatively, alkaline treatment significantly inhibited the total energy recovery with an ECE of 31.9%. The findings of this study suggested that optimised pretreatment strategy for algae needs to be developed to avoid fermentable compounds loss and achieve a higher ECE.

AB This paper presents the numerical-experimental study carried out on a new rotor adapted from a Savonius rotor. Aesthetic, ergonomic and functional requirements have been incorporated into it in order to be part of sustainable consumer products. The new rotor consists of a parametric model adaptable to the dimensions and geometry of the products which it will be part of. A set of translation, symmetry, rotation and scaling operations have been applied to the bucket sections of the Savonius rotor by means of transforming the initial cylindrical buckets into topological surfaces with an organic shape. The new modified Savonius rotor and the conventional Savonius with the same Aspect Ratio have been tested in an open jet wind tunnel in order to verify the influence level of product design parameters on rotor performance, in terms of power coefficient, torque coefficient and mechanical power generated. Experimental tests have been carried out for Reynolds values in the range of [3.430.10(4) and 1.419.10(5)]. A numerical analysis using an incompressible unsteady Reynolds average Navier Stockes model has been validated by means of the experimental results. Experimental and numerical results coincide with a 3.5% error. The behavior of the turbine has been analyzed by varying the angle of rotation for the sections of its buckets. Using a rotation angle of 45 degrees the power coefficient values improve by 32% compared to the values obtained using an angle of 0 degrees. The rotor has been dimensioned for its application in a patented consumer product of small dimensions and requirements of lateral accessibility to its interior. Under these limited conditions the rotor meets the small-scale energy requirements of the product. The new rotor is designed as an aid to the energy consumption of the product in which it is incorporated, maintaining the advantages of a conventional Savonius rotor as self-starting, easy manufacture and maintenance, obtaining at the same time a product that sells better, is more able to integrate into its environment and is customizable for the consumer.

AB A new hybrid concentrator photovoltaic-phase change material system is developed to attain rapid thermal dissipation by enhancing the typically low thermal conductivity of phase change materials. The developed system includes four different configurations of phase change material heat sinks: single cavity, three-parallel cavity, five-parallel cavity, and three-series cavity configuration. Furthermore, nine different pattern arrangements of phase change materials are studied. A comprehensive two-dimension model of photovoltaic layers integrated with phase change material heat sink is developed to predict the transient temperature variation at different concentration ratios of 10 and 20. The model is numerically simulated and validated with the available experimental data; the heat sink configurations with three and five parallel cavities are found to significantly reduce the solar cell temperature compared to the single cavity and three-series cavity heat sink configurations. Furthermore, the use of a five-parallel cavity heat sink is found to greatly enhance temperature uniformity of the solar cell. Substantial enhancement in temperature uniformity is also observed with different pattern arrangements of the phase change materials using the three-parallel cavity configuration. These findings can help identify the optimal configuration of heat sinks and pattern arrangements of phase change materials in order to achieve higher performance with concentrator photovoltaic systems.

AB The objective of this research is a comparative analysis of various kinds of heat and mass exchangers of dew point indirect evaporative cooler. Considering three key performance parameters of an evaporative cooler, namely life-cycle cost, annual water consumption and the annual average of the coefficient of performance as objective functions, the best design of two popular types of the dew-point evaporative cooler (counter-regenerative and cross configurations) for employing in small-scale residential buildings was found through a multi-objective optimization approach. Both operational and geometric characteristics of the coolers were selected as the design (decision) variables while proper constraints such as thermal comfort were imposed. Afterward, between the optimized counter-regenerative and cross configurations, the foremost one was selected for representative cities of four diverse groups within the Koppen-Geiger climate classification system. It was found that in very hot and dry areas, the counter-regenerative configuration was the ideal choice while in other investigated climates, using cross configuration was a better alternative. Moreover, the results showed that in comparison to the base case conditions by using the best-optimized configurations, 64.4, 86.4, and 1039.0% improvements in life-cycle cost, the annual water consumption, and the annual average of the coefficient of performance were achieved, respectively.

AB An optimal process configuration for double-effect water-lithium bromide absorption refrigeration systems with series flow where the solution is first passed through the high-temperature generator - is obtained by minimization of the total annual cost for a required cooling capacity. To this end, a nonlinear mathematical programming approach is used. Compared to the optimized conventional double-effect configuration, the new optimal configuration obtained in this paper allows reducing the total annual cost, the capital expenditures, and the operating expenditures by around 9.5%, 11.1% and 4.9%, respectively. Most importantly, the obtained optimal solution eliminates the low-temperature solution heat exchanger from the conventional configuration, rendering a new process configuration. The energy integration between the weak and strong lithium bromide solutions (cold and hot streams, respectively) takes place entirely at the high-temperature zone, and the sizes and operating conditions of the other process units change accordingly in order to meet the problem specification with the minimal total annual cost. This new configuration was obtained for wide ranges of the cooling capacity (150-450 kW) and the temperature of the cooling water (15-35 degrees C). The results of this work motivate to apply the simultaneous optimization approach to seek for new multi-effect absorption refrigeration system configurations with parallel and reverse flow as well as other series flow arrangements that minimize the total annual cost.

AB The impact of carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology on the coal-fired power generation was evaluated in this paper. The impact was measured through the cost of conserved water (CCW) as an indicator. This indicator was estimated by combining water demand coefficients and levelized cost of electricity (LCOE). CCW was calculated based on a reference case for each of the developed 66 generic pathways of coal-based power generation with CCS. The current existing mix of power generation in the Province of Alberta, Canada was taken as the reference case in this paper. Water consumption coefficients for coal-based power generation with CCS were found in the range 1.01-4.85 m(3)/MWh based on the complete life cycle and 0.15-3.65 m(3)/MWh for the power generation stage. Based on the complete life cycle boundary, pathways involved ultra-supercritical configuration and oxyfuel combustion CCS technology offer the lowest CCW, with values less than 0.89 USD per m(3) of water saved for consumption and less than 0.66 USD per m(3) of water saved for withdrawals. In the sensitivity analysis, LCOE for the pathways involved dry cooling was increased by 6.00 USD/MWh over the base case value, and the resulted corresponding increase in the CCW was found in the range 9-33% compared to the base case.

AB In this study, microwave irradiation-assisted alkaline-catalysed transesterification was used to produce W70CI30 biodiesel from a mixture of waste cooking oil and Calophyllum inophyllum oil. The methanol/oil ratio, catalyst concentration, stirring speed, and reaction time were optimized using response surface methodology based on the Box-Behnken experimental design in order to maximize the biodiesel yield. The quadratic response surface regression model was used to predict the biodiesel yield. It is found that the optimum methanol/oil ratio, catalyst concentration, stirring speed, and reaction time are 59.60 (v/v)%, 0.774 (w/w)%, 600 rpm, and 7.15 min, respectively, and the predicted biodiesel yield is 97.40%. Experiments were conducted using the optimum process parameters and the average biodiesel yield is 97.65%, which is in excellent agreement with the predicted value. The physicochemical properties of the W70CI30 biodiesel produced using the optimum process parameters were measured and it is found that the biodiesel has significantly higher oxidation stability (18.03 h) compared with the waste cooking oil biodiesel (4.61 h). In addition, the physicochemical properties and cold flow properties of the biodiesel fulfil the fuel specifications stipulated in the ASTM D6751 and EN 14214 standards. It can be concluded that microwave irradiation-assisted transesterification is effective to boost the biodiesel yield and produce biodiesel of superior quality. In addition, this method significantly reduces the reaction time of the transesterification process to 9.15 min and the process is energy-efficient. It is believed that the findings of this study will be beneficial for microwave irradiation-assisted biodiesel synthesis on the industrial scale.

AB In this study, ammonia-water double effect absorption refrigeration/Kalina cogeneration cycle and two different configurations of ammonia-water absorption refrigeration/Kalina cogeneration cycles are considered for heat recovery from the high temperature heat source. In this type of cogeneration cycles, power generation and refrigeration cycles have become a single cycle that power and cooling are produced simultaneously in a common loop. After applying the first and second laws of thermodynamics on the components of the considered cycles and the validation of them, by developing SPECO approach on the considered cogeneration cycles, the cycles are simulated from the exergoeconomic viewpoint. For this purpose, the unit cost and cost rate of all streams of the cycles as well as the important thermodynamic and thermoeconomic parameters of each component and the considered cogeneration cycles are calculated. The simulation results indicate that although the thermodynamic efficiency of the double effect absorption refrigeration/Kalina cogeneration cycle is much higher than thermodynamic efficiency of other considered cycles, the economic performance of this cycle is not very desirable. Among the considered cogeneration cycles, the best thermoeconomic performance belongs to the first configuration absorption refrigeration/Kalina cycle. Also, in all cases, the boiler and the low pressure absorber have the highest sum of exergy destruction and capital investment cost rates and should be taken into consideration from exergoeconomic viewpoint for better performance of the cogeneration cycles. The most critical components from the exergy viewpoint are also included boiler, the low pressure absorber and rectifier.

ID SUPERCRITICAL CO2 RECOMPRESSION; BRAYTON CYCLES
AB This paper examines both energy and exergy performances of parabolic trough collectors (PTCs), as part of a solar power plant, under different design and operating conditions. The proposed solar power plant utilizes an innovative supercritical carbon dioxide (S-CO2) power cycle to convert the heat produced by the PTCs to power. In addition, the present system integrates a thermal energy storage (TES) to overcome the intermittent nature of solar energy and extend the hours of operation. Therefore, detailed thermodynamic and heat transfer analyses are conducted to assess heat losses, exergy destructions, and energy and exergy efficiencies. The state-of-the-art PTCs technologies are considered to set the design parameters used in the modeling of the solar field. Furthermore, the effects of varying some operating conditions on the energy and exergy performance of the PTCs and the S-CO2 power cycle are investigated. These parameters include beam radiation intensity, beam incidence angle, and receiver emittance. Subsequently, the resultant impacts of changing these parameters on the overall solar power plant energy and exergy efficiencies are examined. The energy and exergy efficiencies of the PTC are found to be 66.35% and 38.51%, respectively.

AB In order to figure out the key acylated anthocyanin compounds accounting for the bioprotective activity of purple sweet potato (Ipomoea batatas L.), ODS packing column, semi-preparative HPLC method, activity evaluation assays, and ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography with quadrupole time-of-flight tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-QTOF-MS) assays were employed. Additionally, our study revealed that the structures of two acylated monomeric anthocyanins, cyanidin 3-caffeoyl-feruloyl sophoroside-5-glucoside and peonidin 3dicaffeoyl sophoroside-5-glucoside were found to have the strongest bioprotective activity, which was identified to be closely related with the ortho-dihydroxybenzene structure, suggesting the more the special structures of catechol moieties, such as caffeoyl and cyanidin, the stronger the bioprotective activity will be. Besides, the aglycon of cyanidin had higher antioxidant capacity than the peonidin, and the acylated residues strengthened the capacity which followed the order of caffeoyl > feruloyl > p-hydroxybenzoyl. These results will lay the groundwork for further researching the structure-activity relationships of acylated monomeric anthocyanins from purple sweet potato.

AB This research was focused on a critical assessment of vacuum frying as a technology enabling minimization of acrylamide formation in potato crisps and reducing undesirable chemical changes that occur in frying oil at high temperatures. The potato slices were fried in rapeseed oil under vacuum at 125 degrees C and atmospheric pressure at 165 degrees C. The experiments were performed on two potato varieties, Saturna and Impala. Vacuum frying reduced the formation of acrylamide by 98% and also other Maillard reaction products, specifically alkylpyrazines. Concurrently a lower extent of oxidative changes was observed in the frying oil, while 3-MCPD esters decreased fairly quickly during conventional frying. Sensory characteristics of the vacuum and conventionally fried potato crisps were evaluated by a 23-member panel. The majority of panellists preferred the flavour of 'conventional crisps', while only a few of them appreciated potato-like fresh flavour of ` vacuum crisps' and classified this product as 'tasty'.

AB Conjugates of ovalbumin (OVA) with (+)-catechin (C), (-)-epigallocatechin (EGC) or (-)-epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) were synthesized through a free-radical grafting approach. The covalent binding between OVA and catechins was confirmed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS). OVA-catechin conjugates were further characterized by a combination of steady-state fluorescence spectroscopy, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and circular dichroism (CD) analyses. Results suggested that the conjugates contained less alpha-helix but more beta-sheet secondary structure than OVA. The catechin-grafting reaction led to improved surface hydrophobicity and decreased tertiary conformation stability of OVA. Compared with that emulsified by OVA, fish oil emulsion coated by conjugates demonstrated smaller droplet size, better storage stability and less viscosity. Besides, conjugates inhibited the lipid oxidation in fish oil emulsion more effectively than OVA because of their higher antioxidant activity and interfacial accumulation.

AB Pigment-binding proteins play important roles in crustacean shell colour change. In this study, a red colourrelated pigment-binding protein, designated LvPBP75, was purified from the shell of Litopenaeus vannamei. HPLC and PAGE analysis showed that LvPBP75 was a homogeneous monomer with molecular mass of 75 kDa. Peptide mass fingerprint analysis revealed that LvPBP75 belonged to hemocyanin, and the released pigment from heated LvPBP75 showed lambda(max) at 481 nm in acetone. The significant red-colour change temperatures were detected at 30 and 80 degrees C, respectively. Based on the determined amino acid fragments, a full-length cDNA of LvPBP75 was cloned and sequenced. The ORF encodes a protein of 662 amino acids having 80% identity with penaeidae hemocyanin. These results strongly suggest a novel function of hemocyanin, namely binding with pigment, and its involvement in L. vannamei shell colour change.

AB Aspergillus flavus is a filamentous fungus found in nature and characterized by the production of bright and colourful colonies. It grows on different substrates, producing secondary metabolites and, if present in foodstuffs, can be a source of health problems for humans and animals, as well as causing economic losses. Traditional methods for fungal identification are based on morphological characteristics, requiring specialists and being very time-consuming. The development of analytical alternatives might have advantages such as greater efficiency, more reproducibility and be less time-consuming. Thus, a qualitative analytical method to detect Aspergillus flavus in food samples, based on the identification of fungal chemical markers by HPLC-MS, was developed. The method comprises methanol extraction followed by HPLC-MS analysis, and was able to identify 14 fungus secondary metabolites, namely aflatoxin B1, aflatoxin G1, aspergillic acid, aspyrone, betaine, chrysogine, deacetyl parasiticolide A, flufuran, gregatin B, hydroxysydonic acid, nicotinic acid, phomaligin A, spinulosin and terrein.

AB This paper describes the development of a simple, low cost chronoamperometric assay, for the measurement of fructose, using a graphite-nanoparticle modified screen-printed electrode (SPCE-G-COOH). Cyclic voltammetry showed that the response of the SPCE-G-COOH enhanced the sensitivity and precision, towards the enzymatically generated ferrocyanide species, over a plain SPCE; therefore the former was employed in subsequent studies.
   Calibration studies were carried out using chronoamperometry with a 40 mu l mixture containing fructose, mediator and FDH, deposited onto the SPCE-G-COOH. The response was linear from 0.1 mM to 1.0 mM. A commercial fruit juice sample was analysed using the developed assay and the fructose concentration was calculated to be 477 mM with a precision of 3.03% (n = 5). Following fortification (477 mM fructose) the mean recovery was found to be 97.12% with a coefficient of variation of 6.42% (n = 5); consequently, the method holds promise for the analysis of commercial fruit juices.

AB Sunflower butter use as an allergen-free alternative to tree and legume nut butter in baking is limited by chlorogenic acid induced greening that occurs at alkaline pH. Limited information is available on controlling this greening in a food matrix. This study examined how different liquid sweeteners and relative humidity influenced greening of sunflower butter cookies. Doughs had similar initial pH (7.52-7.66) which increased to 8.44-9.13 after baking as ranked: xylitol > maple syrup > corn syrup > honey > agave syrup. Cookies made with maple syrup had the highest moisture and greening corresponding with lowest free chlorogenic acid. The % greening followed the same trend as greening intensity, and was positively correlated (r = 0.9101) with chlorogenic-lysine adduct content. Our findings provide an ingredient solution to controlling greening, as results demonstrate that greening can be promoted with high relative humidity storage, and use of high moisture and pH ingredients. Unwanted greening can be inhibited by simply changing the liquid sweetener.

AB Flavonoids are naturally occurring phenolic compounds with potential health-promoting activities. Although anthocyanins and phenolic acids in coloured rice have been investigated, few studies have focused on flavonoids. Herein, we analysed flavonoids in a yellow grain rice mutant using UHPLC-DAD-ESI-Q-TOF-MS, and identified 19 flavonoids by comparing retention times and accurate mass measurements. Among them, six flavonoids, isoorientin, isoorientin 2 ''-O-glucoside, vitexin 2 ''-O-glucoside, isovitexin, isoscoparin 2 ''-O-glucoside and isoscoparin, were isolated and fully identified from the yellow grain rice mutant, and the levels were significantly higher than wild-type, with isoorientin particularly abundant in mutant embryo. Significant differences in total phenolic compounds and antioxidant activity were observed in mutant rice by DPPH, FRAP and TEAC assays. The results suggest that the representative six flavonoids may play an important role in colouration and antioxidant activity of embryo and endosperm tissue. The findings provide insight into flavonoid biosynthesis and the possibility of improving functionality in rice.

AB Darkening processed fruits and vegetables is caused mainly by enzymatic browning through polyphenol oxidase (PPO) action. Accordingly, we explored the potential of four silica-based materials (MCM-41 nanometric size, MCM-41 micrometric size, UVM-7 and aerosil), non-functionalised and functionalised with thiol groups, to inhibit PPO activity in the model system and apple juice. All materials showed relevant performance when immobilising and inhibiting PPO in model systems, and support topology is a main factor for enzyme immobilisation and inhibition. Thiol-containing silica UVM7-SH showed the greatest inactivation, and similar browning values to those obtained by acidification. The enzyme's kinetic parameters in the presence of UVM-7-SH suggested non-competitive inhibition, which indicated that the material interacted with the enzyme, but beyond the active centre. In real systems, UVM-7-SH completely inhibited enzymatic browning in apple juice (cv. Granny Smith and cv. Golden Delicious) up to 9 days after 5 min of contact.

AB Fresh-cut cantaloupe melon is valued for its aroma but is highly perishable. Temperature of storage (typically 0-5 degrees C) is critical for maintaining fresh-cut melon quality, but often reaches 10 degrees C during transportation and in retail outlets. A comparison amongst 0, 5 and 10 degrees C storage temperatures for fresh-cut melon over 14 days reveals that storage at 0 degrees C is optimal for avoiding increases in microbial load and loss of vitamin C especially at later time points. However, higher temperatures maintain better the balance of esters (acetate versus non-acetate) and phenolic content. The whole volatile organic compound (VOC) profile can be used to discriminate both time and temperature effects especially at earlier time points. Potential VOC markers for changes in vitamin C from day 0 to day 6 of storage (3-methyl butane nitrile) and temperature (limonene) are identified through a multi-trait analysis.

AB Yerba mate is a beverage rich in bioactive compounds popular in South America. Polyphenols and methyl-xanthines were qualitatively and quantitatively analyzed in four commercial brands of yerba mate, as well as the antioxidant capacity of the beverages. Using LC/MSn analysis, 58 polyphenols were observed of which 4-sina-poylquinic acid, di-and tri-methoxycinnamoylquinic acids, two isomers of trimethoxycinnamoylshikimic acid and four isomers of caffeoyl-2,7-anhydro-3-deoxy-2-octulopyranosonic acid were identified for the first time in mate. Additionally, 46 polyphenols and 2 methylxanthines were quantified by HPLC-DAD. Hydroxycinnamic acid derivatives and flavonols comprised 90% and 10% of mate phenols, respectively, 3-caffeoylquinic (26.8-28.8%), 5-caffeoylquinic (21.1-22.4%), 4-caffeoylquinic (12.6-14.2%) and 3,5-dicaffeoylquinic acids (9.5-11.3%) along with rutin (7.1-7.8%) were the most abundant polyphenols, whereas caffeine was the main methylxanthine (90%). Ilex paraguariensis is an important source of polyphenols with moderate methylxanthines content; therefore its high antioxidant capacity was mainly associated to its polyphenolic composition.

AB A multi-residue method was developed for the determination of 124 pesticide residues in Chinese liquor and liquor-making raw materials (sorghum and rice hull) by rapid Multi-plug Filtration Cleanup (m-PFC) and GC-MS/ MS detection. Different combination and proportion sets of sorbents were initially optimized for each matrix with a dispersive solid-phase extraction (d-SPE) procedure. Satisfactory linearity was obtained for the 124 pesticides with regression coefficients (R-2) greater than 0.9901. Mean recoveries of 121 pesticides were in the range of 71-121% with Relative Standard Deviations (RSDs) lower than 16.8% except cyprodinil, diflufenican and prothioconazole. The Limit of Quantification (LOQs) was in the range of 1.0 x10(-4) -5.0 x10(-3) mg kg(-1) and the Limit of Detection (LODs) ranged from 3.0 x10(-5) to 1.5 x10(-3) mg kg(-1) for the 124 pesticides in the matrices. It is demonstrated the m-PFC procedure is superior to the d-SPE method and it could be used to routinely monitor of pesticide residues in market samples.

AB Three-dimensional (3D) hierarchical magnetic hollow sphere-like CuFe2O4 (3D HMHS-CuFe2O4) were designed to sensitively detect four Sudan dyes combined with HPLC-DAD. The formation mechanism of 3D HMHSCuFe2O4 is also discussed. Compared to the particle-like CuFe2O4 (PL-CuFe2O4), the as-obtained 3D HMHSCuFe2O4 provided a higher extraction efficiency for the four Sudan dyes (I, II, III and IV) due to its hierarchical hollow structure with properly interconnected pores where the targets can easily diffuse into the reaction sites. Thus, a magnetic solid-phase extraction (MSPE)-HPLC method was established for the simultaneous measurement of the four Sudan dyes. Under optimized conditions, good linearity (5-4000 ng g(-1), r(2) >= 0.9991), limits of detection (LODs, 0.56-0.60 ng g(-1)), recoveries (91.1%-99.3%) and precision (RSDs <= 4.9%) for the four Sudan dyes were obtained. The proposed MSPE-HPLC-DAD method is a convenient, effective, sensitive and timesaving method for the rapid isolation and determination of four Sudan dyes in preserved bean curd.

AB A new simple, isocratic, selective and highly sensitive method has been developed for the simultaneous separation and determination of two plant growth regulators (PGRs): 2-(1-Naphthyl) acetic acid (NAA) and 2(Naphthalen-1-yl) acetamide (NAD). Both PGRs were extracted by modified and miniaturized ion chromatography-Quick, Easy, Cheap, Effective, Rugged and Safe (IC-QuEChERS) method from ten food samples. The separation and sensitive determination were carried out by using ion chromatography coupled with fluorescence and ultraviolet (IC-FLD/UV) detector. The proposed analytical and extraction methods were validated by using blank samples, fortified with a standard solution of these two PGRs at three concentration levels 5, 15 and 25 mu g/ kg. The method showed good linearity (r(2) = 0.980), satisfactory recoveries (76.3-112) with tolerable precision having relative standard deviations less than 15.4% (RSDs, n = 3). The limit of detection and limit of quantification were also in the range of 0.08-6.6 ng/kg and 2.2-20 ng/kg, respectively.

AB Hibiscus extract (HE) has a strong antioxidant activity and high anthocyanin content; it can be used as a natural pigment, also adding potential health benefits. The objective of this work was the microencapsulation of HE anthocyanin by ionic gelation (IG) using two techniques: dripping-extrusion and atomization, both by means of a double emulsion (HE/rapseed oil/pectin) and a cross-linked solution (CaCl2). Particles (77-83% moisture content) were conditioned in acidified solution at 5, 15 and 25 degrees C, absence of light, and evaluated for anthocyanins and color for 50-days. The median diameter (D50) of the particles ranged from 78 to 1100 mu m and encapsulation efficiency ranged from 67.9 to 93.9%. The encapsulation caused higher temperature stability compared with the free extract. The half-life (t1/2) values of the particles ranged from 7 (25 degrees C) to 180 days (5 degrees C) for anthocyanins and from 25 (25 degrees C) to 462 days (5 degrees C) for Chroma value. The IG increased the stability of HE anthocyanin. Both the dripping-extrusion and the atomization have shown to be feasible techniques.

AB Mandarin peel is a good source of phenolic compounds, which can be extracted by the ultrasound-assisted extraction (UAE) method. This research was to optimize the UAE conditions for maximum mandarin peel extract (MPE) relating to the extract yield, total phenolic content and the content of a mandarin peel rich flavonoid, hesperidin, using a response surface method comparing with the maceration extraction (MAE) method. The results showed that the selected factors (temperature, time and power) have a significant influence on the extraction yield, total phenolic content and hesperidin content. The extraction at 48 degrees C and 56.71 W for 40 min was considered the optimal UAE condition since it provided the maximum yield (26.52%), total phenolic (15,263.32 mg Eq gallic/100 g DW) and hesperidin (6435.53 mg/100 g DW). At the same extraction temperature and time, UAE showed greater extraction efficiency than MAE with 1.77 times higher yield than that of MAE.

AB The ability to detect the undeclared addition of a juice of lesser economic value to one of higher value (juice-tojuice debasing) is a particular concern between apple and pear juices due to similarities in their major carbohydrate/polyol profiles. Fingerprint compounds for the detection of this type of adulteration were identified in both commercial apple and pear juices by HPLC-PDA, were isolated chromatographically, and structurally identified by LC-MS/MS. The apple juice fingerprint was identified as 4-O-p-coumarylquinic acid and two pear compounds as isorhamnetin-3-O-rutinoside and abscisic acid. Additionally, the HPLC-PDA profile of pear juices in combination with pear fingerprint compounds including arbutin could be used to identify samples originating from China versus those from other geographical locations.

AB Polydiacetylene (PDA) vesicles have been applied as optical sensors in different areas, although there are difficulties in controlling their responses. In this study, we prepared nanoblends of PDA with triblock copolymers (TC) as a better sensor system for detecting temperature change. The influences of diacetylene (DA) monomer, and the TC chemical structure and concentration on the colorimetric response (CR) were examined. The TC/PDA nanoblend was remarkably more sensitive to temperature change, than classical vesicles. A higher L64 concentration of 12.0%(w/w) reduced the chromatic transition temperature (T-tr) to as low as 24 degrees C. When using different TCs, the T-tr values can be ordered as L35 < F68< L64 < F127< P123, indicating the importance of the hydrophobic environment for the colorimetric transition of nanoblends. The results here demonstrated that the balance of intermolecular interaction between TC-TC, TC-DA, and DA-DA enables the construction of strategic sensor for detecting temperature changes in different applications.

AB Cashew and pistachio allergies are considered a serious health problem. Previous studies have shown that thermal processing, pressurization and enzymatic hydrolysis may reduce the allergenic properties of food by changing the protein structure. This study assesses the allergenic properties of cashew and pistachio after thermal treatment (boiling and autoclaving), with or without pressure (autoclaving), and multiple enzymatic treatments under sonication, by SDS-PAGE, western blot and ELISA, with serum IgE of allergic individuals, and mass spectroscopy. Autoclaving and enzymatic hydrolysis under sonication separately induced a measurable reduction in the IgE binding properties of pastes made from treated cashew and pistachio nuts. These treatments were more effective with pistachio allergens. However, heat combined with enzymatic digestion was necessary to markedly lower IgE binding to cashew allergens. The findings identify highly effective simultaneous processing conditions to reduce or even abolish the allergenic potency of cashew and pistachio.

AB Quinoa starch has small granules with relatively low gelatinization temperatures and amylose content. High hydrostatic pressure (HHP) is a non-thermal technique for food processing. In this study, effects of HHP up to 600 MPa on physical properties of quinoa starch were studied and compared with those of a normal maize starch. Both starches gelatinized at 500 and 600 MPa. The pressure of 600 MPa completely gelatinized quinoa starch as revealed by thermal analysis. Dynamic rheological analysis showed that HHP improved the gel stability of both starches during cooling. HHP had little effects on amylopectin recrystallization and gel textural properties of starch. Overall, quinoa starch was more susceptible to HHP than maize starch. The effects of HHP on some rheological properties such as frequency dependence were different between these two types of starches. The differences could be attributed to the different composition, granular and chemical structures of starch, and the presence of granule remnants.

AB Plant sterol (PS) oxidation products (POP) derived from sitosterol and campesterol were measured in 15 foods cooked with liquid margarine without (control) and with added 7.5% PS. POP were analyzed using a GC-MS method. PS liquid vs. control margarine resulted in a higher median POP content per food portion (1.35 mg, range 0.08-13.20 mg versus 0.23 mg, 0.06-0.90 mg), a lower PS oxidation rate (0.63 vs. 1.29%) and lower oxidation susceptibility of sitosterol vs. campesterol. POP formation was highest in shallow-fried potatoes with PS liquid margarine (64.44 mg per portion food plus residual fat). Mean relative abundances of epoxy-, 7-keto-, 7-hydroxy-and triol-PS derived from sitosterol and campesterol were 40.0, 34.4, 21.5 and 4.0% with control vs. 44.1, 23.8, 29.6 and 2.4% with PS liquid margarine. In conclusion, PS liquid margarine increased POP content in foods with a POP profile characterized by a higher ratio of epoxy-to 7-keto-derivatives.

AB The objective of this work was to study solid/oil/water (S/O/W) emulsions as delivery systems with retained lactase in milk and controlled release during in vitro digestion. Spray-dried lactase powder was suspended in anhydrous milk fat/Span (R) 80 emulsified by sodium caseinate and lecithin (5: 1). The S/O/W emulsion had an encapsulation efficiency of 75%, a hydrodynamic diameter of 292 nm, and a zeta potential of - 17.37 mV. Crosslinking the dialyzed emulsion with transglutaminase eliminated the detection of free lactase after freeze-drying emulsions and the addition of sodium caseinate further preserved lactase activity. The hydrolysis of lactose in full-fat or skim milk after 3-week storage reduced from > 75% for free lactase to < 15% for encapsulated lactase. The encapsulated lactase was released gradually during the simulated digestions to hydrolyze lactose in milk more efficiently than free lactase. The present findings suggest S/O/W emulsions are potential delivery systems to incorporate lactase in milk products.

AB An aqueous process for the recovery of oil bodies from rapeseed using sodium bicarbonate-based soaking and grinding media (pH 9.5) was investigated. The effect of the ratio between seed and mass of media during grinding and molarity of the medium used on oil body integrity, purity and storage stability have been studied. The grinding of seeds in solution at a ratio of 1:7 (w/w) significantly improved the quality of oil body suspension to a size more in-line with that seen in vivo (average D-4,D-3 of 1.19 mu m). The purity and the composition of the recovered oil bodies depends on the molarity of medium used; the use of a sodium bicarbonate solution (pH 9.5, 0.1 M) in the grinding and washing steps produced oil body preparations with the same purity as that resulting from washing a crude preparation with 9 M urea. The resultant emulsion had improved physical stability over a storage period of one month.

AB Surface Enhanced Raman Scattering (SERS) spectroscopy technology is widely used in materials analysis, environmental monitoring, biomedical, food security and other fields. Flower-shaped silver nanoparticles have been successfully synthesized by a simple aqueous phase silver nitrate reduction by ascorbic acid in the presence of polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) surfactant. The nanoparticles diameters were adjusted from 450 to 1000 nm with surface protrusions up to 10-25 nm. The flower-shaped silver nanostructures obtained were used as stable SERS substrates with high SERS activity for detecting Rhodamine 6G (R6G), at a concentration of only 10(-9) mol/L, where the SERS signal is still clear. SERS spectroscopy of four different food colorants (e.g. food blue, tartrazine, sunset yellow, acid red) were analysed and the characteristic bands were identified. An improved principle component analysis (PCA) was used for four different food colorants detection, at concentrations down to about 10(-8) mol/L. Thus, the LOD of food blue, tartrazine, sunset yellow and acid red are 79.285 mu g/L, 5.3436 mu g/L, 45.238 mu g/L and 50.244 mu g/L, respectively.

AB A new technique is presented to optimize the formulation of microcapsules loaded with labile compounds. Fish oil was loaded into the microcapsule core and protected with a shell composed of whey protein microgel/beet pectin complexes. The microcapsules were formed using two different methods: microfluidics and homogenization. The microcapsules were further classified into three sub-groups. The first group was the microcapsules cross-linked with laccase (MCL), the second group was the microcapsules cross-linked with divalent cationic CaCl2 salt (MCS), and the third group consisted of control microcapsules (CM), with no cross-linking. The microfluidics method enabled tracking of the effect of the shell cross-linking ability of laccase, or CaCl2, on microcapsules. It was demonstrated that MCL obtained by microfluidics are more physicochemically stable than those produced via a homogenizer. The effect of cross-linking agents on the microcapsules were more significant when the microcapsules were produced by microfluidics.

AB Triticale (x Triticosecale Wittmack), a man-made cereal from wheat and rye hybridization, is mainly used as animal feed. In recent years, there has been increasing interest in utilising triticale for food production. Some chemical constituents (e.g., starch and non-starch polysaccharides) of triticale as well as the genetic variability in nutritional composition have been much studied. Various food and beverage products of triticale have been developed, including bakery products (e.g., bread and cookie), pasta, malt, spirit, yoghurt, and biodegradable and edible films. Focusing on the literatures from the last 5 years, this mini-review summarises the recent advances in the nutritional composition and diverse food uses of triticale. There is a wide variation in the chemical composition of triticale, which suggests the potential of triticale as a cereal alternative for various food and beverage applications.

AB The conversion of barley starch to sugars is a complex enzymic process. Most previous work concerned the biotechnical aspect of in situ barley enzymes. However, the interactions among the macromolecular substrates and their effects on enzymic catalysis has been little examined. Here, we explore the mechanisms whereby interactions of protein and starch in barley flour affect the kinetics of enzymatic hydrolysis of starch in an in vitro system, using digestion rate data and structural analysis by confocal microscopy. The degradation kinetics of both uncooked barley flour and of purified starches are found to be two-step sequential processes. Barley proteins, especially the water-soluble component, are found to retard the digestion of starch degraded by a-amylase: the enzyme binds with water-insoluble protein and with starch granules, leading to reduced starch hydrolysis. These findings are of potential industrial value in both the brewing and food industries.

AB Mycobacterium leprae has a reduced genome size due to the reductive evolution over a long period of time. Lipid metabolism plays an important role in the life cycle and pathogenesis of this bacterium. In comparison to 26 lip genes (Lip A-Z) of M. tuberculosis, M. leprae retained only three orthologs indicating their importance in its life cycle. ML0314c (LipU) is one of them. It is conserved throughout the mycobacterium species. Bioinformatics analysis showed the presence of an alpha/beta hydrolase fold and 'GXSXG' characteristic of the esterases/lipases. The gene was expressed in E. coli and purified to homogeneity. It showed preference towards short chain esters with pNP-acetate as the preferred substrate. The enzyme showed optimal activity at 45 degrees C and pH 8.0. ML0314c protein was stable between temperatures ranging from 20 to 60 degrees C and pH 5.0-8.0, i.e., relatively acidic and neutral conditions. The active site residues predicted bioinformatically were confirmed to be Ser168, Glu267, and His297 by site directed mutagenesis. E-serine, DEPC and Tetrahydrolipstatin (THL) completely inhibited the activity of ML0314c. The protein was localized in cell wall and extracellular medium. Several antigenic epitopes were predicted in ML0314c. Protein elicited strong humoral immune response in leprosy patients, whereas, a reduced immune response was observed in the relapsed cases. No humoral response was observed in treatment completed patients. Overexpression of m10314c in the surrogate host M. smegmatis showed marked difference in the colony morphology and growth rate. In conclusion, ML0314c is a secretary carboxyl esterase that could modulate the immune response in leprosy patients.

AB Mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) from bone marrow hold great potential as a cell source for cartilage repair. The objective of our study was differentiation of MSC toward chondrocyte by using Nanofiber-based polyethersulfone (PES) scaffold and also enhanced chondrogenic differentiation of BMSC in vitro. MSCs were harvested from bone marrow of human and PES scaffold was fabricated via Electrospinning. The isolated cells were cultured on the PES scaffold and scaffold free method. After 21 days, Real-time PCR was performed to evaluate the cartilage-specific genes in the mRNA levels. Also, in order to confirm our results, we have done immunocytochemistry and SEM imaging. Flowcytometry confirmed the nature of the isolated adherent cells. Immunocytochemistry and SEM imaging confirmed the differentiation of MSC toward chondrocyte. Also, real time PCR showed a significant increased gene expression of collagen type II and aggrecan on the PES scaffold method when compared to the mRNA levels measured in scaffold free method. Down regulation of Collagen type I was observed in PES scaffold compared to scaffold free at day 21. Also, both methods showed a similar pattern of expression of SOX9. Our results showed that PES scaffold maintains BMSC proliferation and differentiation, and can significantly enhance chondrogenic differentiation of BMSC. PES scaffold seeded BMSC showed the highest capacity for differentiation into chondrocyte-like cells.

AB The study first aimed to apply a design of experiment (DoE) approach to investigate the influences of excipients on the properties of liquid self-microemulsifying drug delivery system (SMEDDS) and SMEDDS loaded in the pellet (pellet-SMEDDS) containing L-tetrahydropalmatine (l-THP). Another aim of the study was to compare the bioavailability of l-THP suspension, liquid SMEDDS and pellet-SMEDDS in the rabbit model. By using Central Composite Face design (CCF), the optimum ratio of Capryol 90, and S-mix '(Cremophor RH 40: Transcutol HP) in the formulation of SMEDDS was determined. This optimum SMEDDS was absorbed on the solid carrier (Avicel or Aerosil) for the preparation of pellet-SMEDDS by extrusion and spheronization method. The ANOVA table indicated that Avicel was more effective than Aerosil, the traditional solid carrier, in both terms of preservation of dissolution rate of l-THP from the original SMEDDS and pelletization yield. Results obtained from scanning electron microscopy (SEM) indicated that the existence of liquid SMEDDS droplets on the surface of pellet-SMEDDS was due to the absorption on Avicel. The powder X-ray diffractometry proved the amorphous state of l-THP in pellet-SMEDDS. Pharmacokinetic study in the rabbit model using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry showed that the SMEDDS improved the oral bioavailability of l-THP by 198.63% compared to l-THP suspension. Besides, pharmacokinetics study also proved that the mean relative bioavailability (AUC) and mean maximum concentration (C-max) of pellet-SMEDDS were not significantly different from the original liquid SMEDDS (p > 0.05).

AB Sericin protein nanoparticles are a biocompatible, bio-viable class of nanocarriers gaining prominence in drug delivery system. This research aimed to investigate the suitability fabrication of silk protein (SP) nanoparticles for loading with resveratrol (RSV) via a solventless precipitation technique. The addition of 0.5% (w/v) pluronic surfactant proved optimal for SP nanoparticle fabrication, with obtained nanoparticles being spherical, mono-dispersed and having mean size of approximately 200-400 nm. All exhibited negative surface charges, the extent of which being dependent on the SP concentration, and were non-toxic to normal skin fibroblasts (CRL-2522). Loading of RSV, a promising which poorly soluble multi-targeted anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory natural polyphenol, into SP nanoparticles proved feasible, with encapsulation levels of 71-75% for 0.6% and 1.0% (w/v) nanoparticle formulations, respectively. Resveratrol-loaded SP nanoparticles strongly inhibited growth of colorectal adenocarcinoma (Caco-2) cells although proved non-cytotoxic to skin fibroblasts, as indicated by cell viability assays. Cellular internalization of SP nanoparticles proved facile and dependent on incubation time; transfection of these carriers, in vitro results indicating sustained release of RSV (over 72 h), and drug solubility enhancements on encapsulation highlight their potential in therapeutic and pharmaceutical applications. Thus, SP nanoparticles is a promising approach to be potential bio-nanocarrier for drug delivery system.

AB The solubility-permeability interplay deals with the question: what is the concomitant effect on the drug's apparent permeability when increasing the apparent solubility with a solubility-enabling formulation? The solubility and the permeability are closely related, exhibit certain interplay between them, and ongoing research throughout the past decade shows that treating the one irrespectively of the other may be insufficient. The aim of this article is to provide an overview of the current knowledge on the solubility-permeability interplay when using solubility-enabling formulations for oral lipophilic drugs, highlighting active permeability aspects. A solubility-enabling formulation may affect the permeability in opposite directions; the passive permeability may decrease as a result of the apparent solubility increase, according to the solubility-permeability tradeoff, but at the same time, certain components of the formulation may inhibit/saturate efflux transporters (when relevant), resulting in significant apparent permeability increase. In these cases, excipients with both solubilizing and e.g. P-gp inhibitory properties may lead to concomitant increase of both the solubility and the permeability. Intelligent development of such formulation will account for the simultaneous effects of the excipients' nature/concentrations on the two arms composing the overall permeability: the passive and the active arms. Overall, thorough mechanistic understanding of the various factors involved in the solubility-permeability interplay may allow developing better solubility-enabling formulations, thereby exploiting the advantages analyzed in this article, offering oral delivery solution even for BCS class IV drugs.

AB Self-emulsifying drug delivery systems based on lipids have gained in interest in recent years due to their capacity to enhance the bioavailability of poorly water soluble drugs. Their oral intake suggests that they will be in contact with gastric and pancreatic enzymes during their passage through the gastrointestinal tract. The study of the evolution of such systems in the presence of enzymes is thus essential to develop better drug delivery vehicles. In this work, the lipolysis of two lipid based self-emulsifying drug delivery systems, Labrasol (R) and Gelucire (R) 44/14 by pancreatic enzymes and under conditions mimicking the gastrointestinal tract are presented. The following of the digestion is realized by Taylor dispersion analysis using fluorescent detection. A hydrophobic marker was used to tag the microdroplets. Results have shown that, Labrasol (R) droplets decrease exponentially in size with lipolysis time, from 11.8 nm to 3.5 nm in 20 min. On the contrary, Gelucire (R) 44/14 droplets increased sigmoidally in size from 5.6 to 24.7 nm. Even after 120 min lipolysis, both systems maintained a solubilizing capacity of the hydrophobic marker.

AB Poloxamer gels are conventionally prepared by the "hot" or the "cold" process. But these techniques have some disadvantages such as high energy consumption, requires expensive equipment and often have scale up issues. Therefore, the objective of this work was to develop poloxamer gels by hot-melt extrusion technology. The model drug selected was ketoprofen. The formulations developed were 30% and 40% poloxamer gels. Of these formulations, the 30% poloxamer gels were selected as ideal gels. DSC and XRD studies showed an amorphous nature of the drug after extrusion. It was observed from the permeation studies that with increasing poloxamer concentration, a decrease in drug permeation was obtained. Other studies conducted for the formulations included in-vitro release studies, texture analysis, rheological studies and pH measurements. In conclusion, the hot-melt extrusion technology could be successfully employed to develop poloxamer gels by overcoming the drawbacks associated with the conventional techniques.

AB Diabetes mellitus is a chronic metabolic health disease affecting the homeostasis of blood sugar levels. However, subcutaneous injection of insulin can lead to patient non-compliance, discomfort, pain and local infection. Submicron sized drug delivery systems have gained attention in oral delivery of insulin for diabetes treatment. In most of the recent literature, the terms "microparticles" and "nanoparticle" refer to particles where the dimensions of the particle are measured in micrometers and nanometers respectively. For instance, insulin-loaded particles are defined as microparticles with size larger than 1 mu m by most of the research groups. The size difference between nanoparticles and microparticles proffers numerous effects on the drug loading efficiency, aggregation, permeability across the biological membranes, cell entry and tissue retention. For instance, microparticulate drug delivery systems have demonstrated a number of advantages including protective effect against enzymatic degradation, enhancement of peptide stability, site-specific and controlled drug release. Compared to nanoparticulate drug delivery systems, microparticulate formulations can facilitate oral absorption of insulin by paracellular, transcellular and lymphatic routes. In this article, we review the current status of microparticles, microcapsules and microspheres for oral administration of insulin. A number of novel techniques including layer-by-layer coating, self-polymerisation of shell, nanocomposite microparticulate drug delivery system seem to be promising for enhancing the oral bioavailability of insulin. This review draws several conclusions for future directions and challenges to be addressed for optimising the properties of microparticulate drug formulations and enhancing their hypoglycaemic effects.

AB A multiscale mixed method aiming at the accurate approximation of velocity and pressure fields in heterogeneous porous media is proposed. The procedure is based on a new domain decomposition method in which the local problems are subject to Robin boundary conditions. The domain decomposition procedure is defined in terms of two independent spaces on the skeleton of the decomposition, corresponding to interface pressures and fluxes, that can be chosen with great flexibility to accommodate local features of the underlying permeability fields. The well-posedness of the new domain decomposition procedure is established and its connection with the method of Douglas et al. (1993) [12], is identified, also allowing us to reinterpret the known procedure as an optimized Schwarz (or Two-Lagrange-Multiplier) method. The multiscale property of the new domain decomposition method is indicated, and its relation with the Multiscale Mortar Mixed Finite Element Method (MMMFEM) and the Multiscale Hybrid-Mixed (MHM) Finite Element Method is discussed. Numerical simulations are presented aiming at illustrating several features of the new method. Initially we illustrate the possibility of switching from MMMFEM to MHM by suitably varying the Robin condition parameter in the new multiscale method. Then we turn our attention to realistic flows in high-contrast, channelized porous formations. We show that for a range of values of the Robin condition parameter our method provides better approximations for pressure and velocity than those computed with either the MMMFEM and the MHM. This is an indication that our method has the potential to produce more accurate velocity fields in the presence of rough, realistic permeability fields of petroleum reservoirs.

AB In this paper, we further investigate the use of a fully discontinuous Finite Element discrete formulation for the study of shallow water free surface flows in the fully nonlinear and weakly dispersive flow regime. We consider a decoupling strategy in which we approximate the solutions of the classical shallow water equations supplemented with a source term globally accounting for the non-hydrostatic effects. This source term can be computed through the resolution of elliptic second-order linear sub-problems, which only involve second order partial derivatives in space. We then introduce an associated Symmetric Weighted Internal Penalty discrete bilinear form, allowing to deal with the discontinuous nature of the elliptic problem's coefficients in a stable and consistent way. Similar discrete formulations are also introduced for several recent optimized fully nonlinear and weakly dispersive models. These formulations are validated again several benchmarks involving h-convergence, p-convergence and comparisons with experimental data, showing optimal convergence properties. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

AB In this paper, an extension of the DDD-FFT approach presented in [1] is developed for heterogeneous elasticity. For such apurpose, an iterative spectral formulation in which convolutions are calculated in the Fourier space is developed to solve for the mechanical state associated with the discrete eigenstrain-based microstructural representation. With this, the heterogeneous DDD-FFT approach is capable of treating anisotropic and heterogeneous elasticity in a computationally efficient manner. In addition, a GPU implementation is presented to allow for further acceleration. As a first example, the approach is used to investigate the interaction between dislocations and second-phase particles, thereby demonstrating its ability to inherently incorporate image forces arising from elastic inhomogeneities.

AB In this work we develop arbitrary-order Discontinuous Skeletal Gradient Discretisations (DSGD) on general polytopal meshes. Discontinuous Skeletal refers to the fact that the globally coupled unknowns are broken polynomials on the mesh skeleton. The key ingredient is a high-order gradient reconstruction composed of two terms: (i) a consistent contribution obtained mimicking an integration by parts formula inside each element and (ii) a stabilising term for which sufficient design conditions are provided. An example of stabilisation that satisfies the design conditions is proposed based on a local lifting of high-order residuals on a Raviart-Thomas-Nedelec subspace. We prove that the novel DSGDs satisfy coercivity, consistency, limit-conformity, and compactness requirements that ensure convergence for a variety of elliptic and parabolic problems. Links with Hybrid High-Order, non-conforming Mimetic Finite Difference and non-conforming Virtual Element methods are also studied. Numerical examples complete the exposition. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

AB Ternary lithium borotellurite glasses of composition(Li2O)(y)[(2TeO(2))(x)-(B2O3)(1) (-) (x)]((1 - y)) (y = 0.33 and 0.40; and 0 <= x <= 1) reveal a negative network former mixing effect, implying that their electrical conductivities and ionic mobilities are lower than those expected by linear interpolation between their binary endmembers. For the y = 0.33 system, the room temperature ionic conductivity decreases from similar to 10(-8) (Omega.cm)(-1) to 10(-11) (Omega.cm)(-1), while the activation energy increases from similar to 0.7 to 1.0 eV with increasing tellurium content. The structural foundations of the network former mixing effect have been probed by multinuclear solid state NMR spectroscopy. Static Te-125 NMR spectra can be modeled by considering inhomogeneous broadening due to the chemical shift anisotropy effects, subject to Gaussian distributions of principal tensor values. The lineshape parameters are only weakly dependent on glass composition. B-11 magic angle spinning (MAS)-NMR studies reveal that the fraction of four-coordinate boron species, B-(4), increases moderately with'increasing tellurium content. Overall, the data suggest that the concentration of heteroatomic connectivities is relatively low, suggesting chemical segregation and/or incipient phase separation into binary lithium tellurite and lithium borate units at the atomic- or the nanoscale. Static Li-7 NMR spectra at low temperatures are governed by the strength of homonuclear Li-7-Li-7 and heteronuclear Li-7-B-11/Li-7-B-10 magnetic dipole-dipole interactions. Considering the second moments for the dipolar magnetic interactions in the lithium-diborate model compound, the second moments of the Li-7 NMR lineshapes could be successfully modeled by a random spatial distribution of the Li+ ions. Phenomenological modelling of the motional narrowing effects observed with increasing temperature results in a consistent description of the negative network former mixing effects in terms of activation energies and dynamic heterogeneities. The negative network former mixing effects is stronger in the system with lower lithium ion content (y = 0.33).
