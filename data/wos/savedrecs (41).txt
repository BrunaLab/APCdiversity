AB With the explosive growth in size of datasets, it becomes more significant to develop effective learning schemes for neural networks to deal with large scale data modelling. This paper proposes an iterative approximate Newton-type learning algorithm to build neural networks with random weights (NNRWs) for problem solving, where the whole training samples are divided into some small subsets under certain assumptions, and each subset is employed to construct a local learner model for integrating a unified classifier. The convergence of the output weights of the unified learner model is given. Experimental results on UCI datasets with comparisons demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is promising for large scale datasets. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Tag-aware dynamic music recommendation
SO EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS
LA English
DT Article
DE Music recommendation; Matrix factorization; Temporal dynamics; Tag aware
AB We present a tag-aware dynamic music recommendation framework that achieves personalized and accurate music recommendations to users. The proposed framework leverages the available semantic labels (in terms of tags) of music tracks to complement a highly sparse user-item interaction matrix, which effectively addresses the data sparsity issue faced by most music recommendation systems. Music tracks are more accurately represented by aggregating the latent factors derived from both the tag space and the user interaction information. The proposed framework further employs a Gaussian state-space model to capture the evolving nature of users' preferences over time, which helps achieve time-sensitive recommendation of music. A variational approximation is developed to achieve fast inference and learning of model parameters. Experiments conducted using actual music data and comparison with state-of-the-art competitive recommendation algorithms help demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.

AB The optimisation of the user tracking process is one of the most challenging tasks in today's advanced cellular networks. In this paper, we propose a new low-complexity adaptive cellular genetic algorithm to solve this problem. The proposed approach uses a torus-like structured population of candidate solutions and regulates interactions inside it by using a bi-dimensional neighbourhood. It also automatically adapts the algorithm's parameters and regenerates the algorithm's population using two algorithmically light operators. In order to draw reliable conclusions and perform an encompassing assessment, extensive experiments have been conducted on 25 differently-sized realistic networks. The proposed approach has been compared against 26 state-of-the-art algorithms previously designed to solve the mobility management problem, and a thorough statistical analysis of results has been performed. The obtained results have shown that our proposal is more efficient and algorithmically less complex than most of the state-of-the-art solvers. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB After formation of the ovalbumin (OVA)-gum arabic (GA) complex coacervates, a more ordered crystal structure was obtained, and the protein denaturation temperature increased from 72 to 96 degrees C. GA can reduce the pH-induced conformational perturbations of ovalbumin. The presence of GA improved the stability of the alpha-helix and beta-turn regions against pH, but showed less influence on the random coil and beta-sheet domains. The complex coacervates showed the highest viscosity value at pH 3.7 compared with the other pH values tested (4.0, 3.4, 3.0, 2.7) due to the stronger interactions of OVA and GA. A large thixotropic loop was observed for the coacervate obtained at pH 3.7 compared with that obtained at pH 4.0. Moreover, the salt concentration and OVA: GA ratio influenced the rheological properties by affecting the structure and composition of the complexes. A stronger interaction between OVA and GA led to greater viscoelastic properties.

AB In this work, a simple and effective strategy for designing a ratiometric fluorescent nanosensor was described. A carbon dots (CDs) based dual-emission nanosensor for nitrite was prepared by coating the CDs on to dye-doped silica nanoparticles. Dual-emission silica nanoparticles fluorescence was quenched in sulfuric acid using potassium bromate (KBrO3). The nitrite present catalyzed the KBrO3 oxidation, resulting in ratiometric fluorescence response of the dual-emission silica nanoparticles. Several important parameters affecting the performance of the nanosensor were investigated. Under optimized conditions, the limit of detection was 1.0 ng mL(-1) and the linear range 10-160 ng mL(-1). Furthermore, the sensor was suitable for nitrite determination in different food samples.

AB A simple and fast analytical method for the determination of Cr, Pb and Cd in brown sugar by GF AAS using slurry sampling was developed and in house validated for the first time. Analytical curves were prepared by external standardization for Cr, and by matrix simulation for Pb and Cd and they were linear. Low limits of quantification for Cr (32.8 ng g(-1)), Pb (49.3 ng g(-1)) and Cd (4.5 ng g(-1)) were found. Repeatability and intermediate precision estimates (< 10% and < 15%, respectively) and recovery rates (95-103%) demonstrated a good precision and accuracy. The levels in brown sugar samples ranged from < 32.8 to 160 ng g(-1) for Cr, from < 49.3 to 211.0 ng g(-1) for Pb and from < 4.5 to 7.0 ng g(-1) for Cd and they may be assigned to anthropogenic activities and the adoption of inadequate practices of production and processing.

AB This study investigated the structure, antioxidant activity, antityrosinase activity and mechanism of proanthocyanidins from mung bean seed [Vigna radiata (L.) Wilczek]. The structural composition were characterized by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS), electrospray ionization-full-mass spectrometry (ESI-Full-MS), and high-pressure liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry (HPLC-ESI-MS) techniques. The mung bean seed proanthocyanidins were composed of procyanidins, prodelphinidins, and their rhamnosides. According to enzyme kinetic analysis, these compounds were potent, reversible, and mixed-type inhibitors of tyrosinase. They inhibited the enzyme activity by interacting with enzyme as well as substrates. The results of molecular docking showed that the interaction between mung bean seed proanthocyanidins and tyrosinase was driven by hydrogen bond, hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions. In addition, mung bean seed proanthocyanidins were demonstrated as powerful antioxidants. Therefore, this study confirmed a novel tyrosinase inhibitor and would lay a scientific foundation for their utilization in pharmaceutical and food industries.

AB We found that oligomeric procyanidins improve the physicochemical properties of wheat flour, and that a more compact and denser gluten microstructure is formed when an increasing amount of oligomeric procyanidins is incorporated. Further, we found that oligomeric procyanidins alter the rheological properties, molecular weight distribution, secondary structure, and thermal stability of gluten, and that oligomeric procyanidins alleviate the loss of extensibility and viscosity after the dough is exposed to high temperatures. Collectively, these results imply that oligomeric procyanidins improve the rheological properties of flour-based foods, likely by (1) regulating sulfhydryl/disulfide redox reactions in the gluten network and impairing the formation of large polymers, and by (2) binding to hydrophobic sites in gluten proteins and altering their conformation.

AB An observational cross-sectional pilot study in 73 Spanish households was conducted to evaluate the impact of consumer practices on the formation of acrylamide during the preparation of French fries from fresh potatoes applying one stage frying. 45.2% of samples presented acrylamide concentrations above the benchmark level for French fries (500 mu g/kg). 6.9% of samples exceeded 2000 mu g/kg and the 95th percentile was 2028 mu g/kg. The median and average values were significantly higher than the EFSA report for this food category, suggesting that the total exposure to acrylamide by the population could be underestimated. In this randomised scenario of cooking practices, the content of reducing sugar and asparagine did not explain the acrylamide levels. However, the chromatic parameter a* of the fried potato was a powerful tool to classify the samples according to the acrylamide benchmark level regardless of the agronomical characteristics of the potato or the consumer practices.

AB A simple approach to fabricate a highly selective and sensitive dimethoate probe was developed based on Rhodamine B (RB)-functionalized gold nanoparticles (AuNPs). The quenching of RB fluorescence in the presence of AuNPs in the solution, mediated by fluorescence resonance energy transfer, was observed. In the presence of dimethoate, the fluorescence intensity of the RB-AuNP solution is gradually recovered when dimethoate molecules displace RB molecules on the surface of the AuNPs, which significantly increased the fluorescence intensity of RB. Fluorescence is proportional to the dimethoate concentration in the range of 0.005-1.0 ppm (R-2 = 0.989), and the LOD was 0.004 ppm. The recoveries of dimethoate in water and fruit samples were 86-116% with a good RSD (< 9.3%). Because of its high sensitivity, excellent selectivity, and convenient fabrication process, this method is a promising candidate for dimethoate screening.

AB Fresh meat safety and quality is a major concern of consumers in the current food market. The objective of this research was to investigate a newly developed gallic acid/chitosan edible coating on the preservation of fresh pork quality in modified atmosphere package (MAP) stored at 4 degrees C. The pork loins were coated with 2% chitosan (CHI), 0.2% gallic acid in 2% chitosan (CHI/0.2G), or 0.4% gallic acid in 2% chitosan (CHI/0.4G). Results showed that the antimicrobial activity of the chitosan coating was increased with the incorporation of gallic acid. The CHI/0.2G and CHI/0.4G pork loins also had lower lipid oxidation and myoglobin oxidation. However, the CHI/0.4G sample exhibited a pro-protein oxidation effect, suggesting an optimal concentration of gallic acid should be incorporated. This research provides a practical method in application of gallic acid/chitosan coatings on preservation of fresh pork to improve the safety and quality in MAP environment.

AB Preparation and characterization of novel functional nanostructured lipid carriers containing beta sitosterol has been studied. The nanostructured lipid carrires (NLCs) were formulated with propolis wax (PW) alone or in mixture (1:1 w/w) with glyceryl behenate (GB), and pomegranate seed oil (PSO) and produced by a hot melt emulsification method. Response surface methodology was used to optimize formulations with respect to beta sitosterol concentration, liquid lipid content and solid lipid composition. The NLCs formulated with less oil and higher drug content showed higher size and lower encapsulation efficiency. Solid state analysis exhibited lower crystallinity of optimal formulations compared to raw lipids and a drug amorphization into the NLC matrix. The compatibility between drug and encapsulating materials was confirmed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. Transmission electron microscopy showed spherical particles ranged around 100 nm confirming the applicability of such formulations for the production of functional foods.

AB The purpose of the study was to determine the effects of high pressure processing (HPP; 400-600 MPa, 20 degrees C, 1.5 or 3 min) and heat treatment (HT; 85 degrees C for 2 min) of strawberry puree and juice made from the same raw material. Microbiological and enzymatic inactivation, Brix, pH, anthocyanins, vitamin C, colour and sensory properties were analysed after processing and cold storage. The microbiological shelf life of the products was at least 49 days when processed at 500 or 600 MPa. Anthocyanins, vitamin C and colour were well preserved after HPP and HT. During storage, anthocyanins, vitamin C and sensory quality were better conserved in HT than in HPP purees, while there were minor differences between HT and HPP juices. This was probably due to higher enzyme activity in HPP purees, and indicates that raw materials with lower initial enzyme activity, like juices, are more suited for HPP than e.g. purees.

AB To study the diversity and cultivar-specific of phytochemicals in sweet potato, Liquid Chromatography-Electrospray Ionization-Mass Spectrometry was used to analyze the metabolic profiles of five sweet potato cultivars exhibiting different flesh colors: purple, yellow/orange, and white. A total of 213 metabolites, including 29 flavonoids and 27 phenolic acids, were characterized. The flavonoid profiles of the five different cultivars were distinguished using PCA, the results suggested the flesh color accounted for the observed metabolic differences. In addition to anthocyanins, quinic acids and ferulic acids were the prominent phenolic acids, O-hexoside of quercetin, chrysoeriol were the prominent flavonoids in sweet potato tubers, and they were all higher in the OFSP and PFSP than WFSP. The main differential metabolic pathways between the OFSP, PFSP and the WFSP included those relating to phenylpropanoid and flavonoid biosynthesis. This study provides new in-sights into the differences in metabolite profiles among sweet potatoes with different flesh colors.

AB Freezing is a practical method for meat preservation but the quality of frozen meat can deteriorate with storage time. This research investigated the effect of frozen storage time (up to 66 months) on changes in DNA yield, purity and integrity in beef, and further analyzed the correlation between beef quality (moisture content, protein content, TVB-N value and pH value) and DNA quality in an attempt to establish a reliable, high-throughput method for meat quality control. Results showed that frozen storage time influenced the yield and integrity of DNA significantly (p < 0.05). The DNA yield decreased as frozen storage time increased due to DNA degradation. The half-life (t(1/2) = ln2/0.015) was calculated as 46 months. The DNA quality degraded dramatically with the increased storage time based on gel electrophoresis results. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) products from both mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and nuclear DNA (nDNA) were observed in all frozen beef samples. Using real-time PCR for quantitative assessment of DNA and meat quality revealed that correlations could be established successfully with mathematical models to evaluate frozen beef quality.

AB A new, sensitive, and rapid method based on the Quick, Easy, Cheap, Effective, Rugged and Safe (QuEChERS) approach and air-assisted liquid-liquid microextraction (AALLME) technology was developed for the determination of 20 endocrine-disrupting compounds (EDCs) in fish by high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. The method first integrates AALLME into QuEChERS to achieve clean-up and enrichment of the EDCs in one step. A self-made glass tube was enfolded with plasticine to withstand the high centrifugal force. The established method was developed by optimization of the parameters. High linearities (R-2 > 0.9924) and recoveries (78.2-118.6%) at three spiked levels (5, 10, and 20 ng g(-1)), and low relative standard deviation values (1.1-14.5%) and limits of detection (0.03-0.80 ng g(-1)) were obtained. The method comparison shows that the proposed method is superior as it involves less organic solvent usage, simple operation and high efficiency. This method was successfully applied to different fishes for analyzing EDCs.

AB Tertiary butylhydroquinone (TBHQ) is a water-insoluble antioxidant. In this study, three cyclodextrin inclusion complexes were prepared to improve the water solubility of TBHQ and expand its range of application. Analysis of phase solubility indicated that TBHQ can form 1:1 inclusion complex with hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin (HP-beta-CD) and dimethyl-beta-cyclodextrin (DM-beta-CD) and 1:2 inclusion complex with beta-cyclodextrin (beta-CD). The possible inclusion configuration between TBHQ and CDs was determined through FT-IR, PXRD, DSC, NMR, and SEM analyses. Results were validated by theoretical study of AutoDock molecular docking. The scavenging effects of the inclusion complexes were not effective on DPPH radical but higher on hydroxyl, superoxide and ABTS+ radicals than that of TBHQ monomer. Moreover, the water solubility of TBHQ increased after complexation with HP-beta-CD and DM-beta-CD. The stability of TBHQ is related to the type of storage materials used, and the stability can be improved by complexation with CDs.

AB We report an aptamer-mediated colorimetric method for sensitive detection of chloramphenicol (CAP). The aptamer of CAP is immobilized by the hybridization with pre-immobilized capture probe in the microtiter plate. The horseradish peroxidase (HRP) is covalently attached to the aptamer by the biotin-streptavidin system for signal production. CAP will preferably bind with aptamer due to the high binding affinity, which attributes to the release of aptamer and HRP and thus, affects the optical signal intensity. Quantitative determination of CAP is successfully achieved in the wide range from 0.001 to 1000 ng/mL with detection limit of 0.0031 ng/mL, which is more sensitive than traditional immunoassays. This method is further validated by measuring the recovery of CAP spiked in two different food matrices (honey and fish). The aptamer-mediated colorimetric method can be a useful protocol for rapid and sensitive screening of CAP, and may be used as an alternative means for traditional immunoassays.

AB We explored the encapsulation of dietary plant flavonols fisetin and its chromophore 3-hydroxyflavone, within 2-hydroxypropyl-gamma-cyclodextrin (HP.-CDx) nano-cavity in aqueous solution using multi-spectroscopic approaches and molecular docking. Upon addition of HP gamma-CDx, dramatic changes occur in the intrinsic 'two color' fluorescence behavior of the fluorophores. This is manifested by significant increase in the steady state fluorescence intensities, anisotropies, average fluorescence lifetimes and rotational correlation times. Furthermore, in the CDx environment, intrinsically achiral flavonols exhibit prominent induced circular dichroism bands. These findings indicate that the flavonol molecules spontaneously enter the relatively hydrophobic, chiral environment of the HP gamma-CDx nano-cavities. Molecular docking computations corroborate the spectroscopic findings, and predict selectivity in orientation of the encapsulated flavonols. HP gamma-CDx inclusion increases the aqueous solubility of individual flavonols similar to 100-1000 times. The present study demonstrates that the hydroxypropyl substituent in gamma-CDx controls the inclusion mode of the flavonols, leading to their enhanced solubilization and altered spectral signatures.

AB The effects of degree of milling (DOM) between 0 and 8% on physico-chemical, structural, pasting and cooking properties of short and long grain Indica rice cultivars were studied. Ash, protein, lipids and minerals decreased while blue value and crystallinity increased with increase in DOM. The colour parameters (a*, b*) and cooking time (CT) decreased while L*(lightness) increased with increase in DOM. Elongation ratio (ER), gruel solid loss (GSL), length/breadth (L/B) and paste viscosities during cooking increased with increase in DOM. Short grain rice contained lower ash, protein, lipids, Mn, K, Ca, CT and GSL than long grain while the later showed higher crystallinity, Mn, P, K, Ca and ER. Paste and dough characteristics measured using Rheometer and Mixolab, respectively correlated well and differed with cultivar and DOM. Short and long grain cultivars showed variation in loss of different chemical constituents during varied DOM causing variation in cooking characteristics.

AB In the present study, the butterhead lettuce cultivar was analyzed by ultrahigh performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC) coupled online to diode array detection (DAD), electrospray ionization (ESI) and quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (QToF/MS) in the positive and negative ion mode in order to characterize its polyphenolic profile for the first time. The instrument acquisition mode MSE was used to collect automatic and simultaneous information of exact mass at high and low collision energies of precursor ions as well as other ions produced as a result of their fragmentation. One hundred eleven phenolic compounds were identified in the acidified hydromethanolic extract of freeze-dried leaves of butterhead lettuce cultivar: 40 hydroxycinnamic acid derivatives, 21 hydroxybenzoic acid derivatives, 2 hydroxyphenylacetic acid derivatives, 18 flavonols, 9 flavones, one flavanone, 7 coumarins, one hydrolysable tannin and 12 lignans. Forty-seven of these compounds have been tentatively identified for the first time in lettuce.

AB Soybean and peanut protein isolates underwent phosphorylation using sodium trimetaphosphate (STMP). Changes in functional properties and the influence of STMP (1, 2 or 3% w/w), pH (11.5 or 12.5), temperature (35 or 55 degrees C) and time (3 or 5 h) were evaluated. The highest degree of phosphorylation was achieved at 2% of STMP and pH 12.5. The best specific conditions varied according to the raw material: in soybean, 25% phosphorylation was achieved at 55 degrees C and 5 h whereas in peanut, 30% was reached at 35 degrees C and 3 h. The modified proteins showed an improved emulsifying activity (27.3% for soybean and 6.6% for peanut), whereas NSI for soybean increased more than three times and for peanut decreased by half. In vitro digestibility improved in both isolates around 1.5%. These results showed that phosphorylation with STMP of peanut and soybean proteins yielded isolates with a wide array of potential applications in food systems.

AB To give a deep insight into the relationship between triacylglycerol and crystallization of interesterified fat, the blends of palm stearin and various vegetable oil were catalyzed by two different immobilized lipases in this study. After interesterification, the blends had wider plastic range indicated by the SFC results and more beta' crystal. The improved physicochemical characteristics of interesterified blends were attributed to their changed TAG profiles. The statistical analysis showed that the interesterified blends were more likely to form beta' crystal with the increase of SU2-type TAG content and the decrease of SSS-type TAG content (p < 0.01). In addition, the decrease of ECN 42- and ECN 48-type TAGs and the increase of ECN 50-type TAGs also significantly enhanced the formation of beta' crystal (p < 0.05). Furthermore, the sn-1,3-specific Lipozyme TL IM-catalyzed interesterified blends were favorable for the formation of beta' crystal than the non-specific Novozym 435-catalyzed interesterified blends.

AB Twenty-nine legumes were assessed for their nutritional and phytochemical compositions. Soybean and black soybean had the highest protein contents (34.05-42.65 g/100 g DW, dry weight of legumes), particularly being a rich source of lysine (1.78-2.23 g/100 g DW. Soybean and black soybean had the highest fat contents (14.13-22.19 g/100 g DW). Broad beans had the highest unsaturated fatty acids (83.57-89.01 g/100 g fatty acid), particularly rich in alpha-linolenic and linoleic acid. The highest and the lowest dietary fiber were found in red kidney beans (35.36 g/100 g DW) and mung beans (22.77 g/100 g DW), respectively. Except for soybean and white kidney bean, 6 major anthocyanins in the legumes samples were identified. The soybean contained the highest total tocopherols content (90.40-120.96 mu g/g dry weight of beans), followed by black soybean (66.13-100.76 mu g/g DW). The highest carotenoids were found in lentils (4.53-21.34 mu g/g DW) and red kidney beans (8.29-20.95 mu g/g DW).

AB Advantages associated with the use of polylactic acid (PLA) nano-or microparticles as drug delivery systems have been widely proven in the field of pharmaceutical sciences. These biodegradable and biocompatible carriers have demonstrated different loading and release properties depending on interactions with the cargo, preparation methods, particles size or molecular weight of PLA. In this study, we sought to show the possibility of influencing these properties by modifying the structure of the constituting polymer. Seven non-functionalized or functionalized PLA polymers were specifically designed and synthesized by microwave-assisted ring-opening polymerization of D, L-lactide. They presented short hydrophobic and/or hydrophilic groups thanks to the use of C20 aliphatic chain, mPEG1000, sorbitan esters (Spans (R)) or polysorbates (Tweens (R)), their PEGylated analogues, as initiators. Then, seven types of drug-loaded nanoparticles (NP) were prepared from these polymers and compared in terms of physico-chemical characteristics, drug loading and release profiles. Although the loading properties were not improved with any of the functionalized PLA NP, different release profiles were observed in an aqueous medium at 37 degrees C and over a period of five days. The presence of PEG moieties in the core of PLA-polysorbates NP induced a faster release while the addition of a single aliphatic chain induced a slower release due to better interactions with the active molecule.

AB Fast hyperthermia (i.e. 39-42 degrees C) triggered doxorubicin release from lysolipid-containing thermosensitive liposomes (LTSL) in the tumor vasculature has been demonstrated to result in considerable enhancement of bioavailable drug levels in heated tumor tissue in preclinical tumor models. However, there is also significant leakage of doxorubicin already at 37 degrees C in the bloodstream, making these LTSL less efficient and increasing the risk for systemic toxicity. In conventional liposomes, cholesterol is incorporated in the bilayer to increase the stability of the liposomes. Here, we investigate the effect of cholesterol inclusion on the doxorubicin release characteristics of LTSL at 37 degrees C and hyperthermic temperatures.
   For this purpose, three LTSL formulations with 0, 5 and 10 mol% cholesterol were prepared. Inclusion of cholesterol reduced the undesired doxorubicin leakage at 37 degrees C in Hepes-buffered saline (HBS) as well as in fetal bovine serum (FBS). The incorporation of cholesterol in the LTSL bilayers did not influence the hyperthermiatriggered release property of the LTSL. These results were supported by DSC measurements.
   Therefore, in conclusion, our data indicate that cholesterol inclusion in LTSL offers a simple solution to the problem of significant leakage of doxorubicin from LTSL already at 37 degrees C in the bloodstream.

AB There is a very large variety in the types of nanoparticulate lipid formulations for oligonucleotides, and remarkably, also a very large heterogeneity in the methods that are used for analyzing oligonucleotide load, encapsulation efficiency and oligonucleotide release. Furthermore, a literature survey showed that the extent to which these procedures are reported in scientific literature varies greatly, with some of them not even reporting any quantification at all. This greatly hampers the reproducibility of nanoparticle preparation between different researchers and between different laboratories, which slows down the clinical translation of such nanomedicines. In this work, a standardized extraction method from liposomes is proposed, in which potential contaminants from the carrier are removed by a simple extraction of the oligonucleotides. These extracts were then analyzed with seven commonly used methods for oligonucleotide quantification, including several absorbance based methods and the most commonly applied dye binding assay. Strikingly, differences in absolute values up to fourfold were found when the same sample was analyzed using different methods which should be taken into consideration when reports using different methods are compared. Furthermore, these results indicate that the most commonly applied method, the dye binding assay, may -without adaptations-not be suitable for short oligonucleotides like siRNAs. The found differences in quantification methods as described here underscore the need for proper documentation of methods to correctly interpret published results, which -with regard to oligonucleotide analysis-is currently lacking in many reports.

AB Peridotites from the Myitkyina ophiolite are mainly composed of lherzolite and harzburgite. The lherzolites have relatively fertile compositions, with 39.40-43.40 wt% MgO, 1.90-3.17 wt% Al2O3 and 1.75-2.84 wt% CaO. They contain spinel and olivine with lower Cr# (12.6-18.2) and Fo values (88.7-91.6) than those of the harzburgites (24.5-59.7 and 89.6-91.6 respectively). The harzburgites have more refractory compositions, containing 42.40-46.23 wt% MgO, 0.50-1.64 wt% Al2O3 and 0.40-1.92 wt% CaO. PGE contents of the peridotites show an affinity to the residual mantle. Evaluation of petrological and geochemical characteristics of these peridotites suggests that the lherzolites and harzburgites represent residual mantle after low to moderate degrees of partial melting, respectively, in the spinel stability field. The U-shaped, primitive mantle-normalized REE patterns and strong positive Ta and Pb anomalies of the harzburgites suggest melt/fluid refertilization in either a MOR or SSZ setting after their formation at a MOR. Mineral separation of the peridotites has yield a range of exotic minerals, including diamond, moissanite, native Si, rutile and zircon, a collection similar to that reported for ophiolites of Tibet and the Polar Urals. The discovery of these exotic minerals in the Myitkyina ophiolite supports the view that they occur widely in the upper oceanic mantle.

AB The burial and exhumation history of an orogen can provide insights into the thermal history of rocks in the mountain belt. Asynchronous collision will exhume materials to the surface at different times and expose different metamorphic grades along the orogenic axis. By tracking the thermal signals of eroded materials, it is possible to compare spatial patterns of exhumation along the mountain belt. Previous studies such as bulk mineralogy of sandstones, crystallinity of clay minerals, and fission track thermochronology all suggest that the Pliocene to Pleistocene meta-sedimentary deposits within the preserved basins of the Coastal Range reflect the unroofing history of the Central Range in Eastern Taiwan. In this study, modern sediments from six drainages of the east Central Range (Liwu, Mugua, Laku-Laku, Luye, Jinlun, and Hsuhai Rivers) and three basin sections of meta-sedimentary deposits from the Coastal Range (Shuilien, Chimei, and Madagida sections) were sampled to reconstruct the thermal signals of each drainage along the modern orogenic axis and reconstruct temporal variations of thermal signals in preserved Plio-Pleistocene sedimentary rocks.
   The temperature index (T.I.) of modern sediments determined by Raman spectroscopy of carbonaceous materials are medium to high (0.4-0.8). In conjunction with bio- and magneto-stratigraphy, our data suggest that the northern Shuilien area has been receiving detritus of medium metamorphic grade from the exhumed orogeny in the north from 3.4 Ma and higher grade since 2 Ma; meanwhile, the southern Madagida section has been mostly taking in juvenile detritus from the south part of the orogen until 1 Ma. The central Chimei section has started collecting mature detritus since 1.24 Ma. The data suggest that the Plio-Pleistocene basins contain a good record of orogen evolution.

TI Late Cenozoic basaltic lavas from the Changbaishan-Baoqing Volcanic

AB Cenozoic intraplate basalts are low in volume but widespread in eastern China. They are predominantly alkaline and have oceanic island basalt (OIB)-like trace element compositions. Despite numerous studies, the origin of Cenozoic basalts in eastern China remains elusive. Possible roles of lithosphere thickness, subduction of Pacific plate and lithosphere-asthenosphere interaction in triggering spatial geochemical variations have not yet been clarified. Here, we have carried out mineral chemistry, major and trace element and Sr-Nd-Hf isotope analyses of the late Cenozoic (<20 Ma) basaltic rocks from the Changbaishan-Baoqing Volcanic Belt (CVB), NE China, which revealed clear spatial compositional variations. The North CVB is dominated by basanites and alkali basalts with OIB-like trace element patterns and depleted Sr-Nd-Hf isotopic compositions (Sr-87/Sr-86 = 0.7039-0.7047, epsilon(Nd) = 3-5.6; epsilon(Hf) = 6.7-12), which may have been derived from low degree partial melting of a depleted source from asthenospheric mantle beneath a thick lithosphere. On the other hand, the South CVB consists of both alkali and sub-alkali lavas (alkali basalts, tholeiites and basaltic andesites) that display generally higher SiO2, Sm/Nd, Ba/Nb, Th/U, and lower Nb/Th, La/Sm and more enriched Sr-Nd-Hf isotopic compositions (Sr-87/Sr-86 = 0.7038-0.7056, epsilon(Nd) = -2.4- + 3.2; epsilon(Hf) = 3-8.2). These rocks may have been produced by larger degrees of partial melting of asthenospheric mantle beneath a relatively thin lithosphere. Ancient metasomatized lithospheric mantle might also have contributed to their genesis. In addition, the similar ranges of Mn, Ni and Fe/Mn for olivine phenocrysts from both the North and the South CVB suggest that they may have been derived from hybrid mantle sources containing similar proportions of peridotite and pyroxenite/eclogite components. We propose that decompression melting of upwelling asthenosphere and mechanical-chemical erosion of basal lithosphere related to lithosphere-asthenosphere interaction responsible for the genesis of the CVB magmas were likely associated with upper mantle convection and back-arc extension induced by deep subduction of the Pacific plate and its stagnancy in the transition zone.

AB Baaran and Baytag "terranes" form important part of the Trans-Altai Zone of the Central Asian Orogenic Belt in the SW Mongolia. The Trans-Altai Zone represents an oceanic domain built by Ordovician to Devonian ophiolites covered by Devonian-Carboniferous oceanic sediments. This oceanic assemblage was intruded by a spectrum of Carboniferous volcanic rocks ranging from basalts to rhyolites (325.6 +/- 1.4 Ma to 351.0 +/- 5.9 Ma; LA-ICP-MS U-Pb dating on zircon) that display similar whole-rock trace-element and Sr-Nd isotopic signatures regardless their silica contents and the "terrane" they belong to. They are normal-K calc-alkaline rocks whose NMORB-normalized multielement patterns show an arc-like enrichment in LILE (Large Ion Lithophile Elements) and deep negative TNT (Ta, Nb, Ti) anomalies. Based on the relatively high Nb/Yb and Th/Yb ratios, the arc was probably formed on immature continental rather than typical oceanic crust. Low (Sr-87/Sr-86)1 (0.7043-0.7047), high epsilon(350)(Nd) (+5.2 to = +5.8) and the observed in-situ Hf isotopic variation in dated zircons (epsilon(t)(Hf) = +7.4 to +13) are all attributed to a partial melting of primitive and youthful (Neoproterozoic-Ordovician) arc-type lower continental crust (metamorphosed intermediate-acid igneous rocks and/or arc-derived greywackes), augmented with, and most likely facilitated by, contemporaneous arc-related basaltic intrusions. A distinct possibility remains the previously formulated model assuming that the Carboniferous magmatism in Gobi-Altai and Trans-Altai zones sampled the juvenile Neoproterozoic to Cambrian arc crust relaminated under the Ordovician-Devonian oceanic crust. In any case, the studied arc association, together with lithological sequence of ophiolites, can be closely correlated with the Dulate arc in eastern Junggar. It is proposed that the two arc sequences form a single belt, c. 500 km long, that represents one of the main known arc structures in the Central Asian Orogenic Belt.

TI Mantle and deep crustal xenoliths in basalts from the Bo Rai ruby

ID FIELD; PETROCHEMISTRY; MEGACRYSTS; SAPPHIRE
AB Various types of xenoliths embedded in basalts within Bo Rai ruby deposit, Trat Province, eastern Thailand can be petrographically subdivided into three main types: (1) peridotites (Ol-Cpx-Opx-Sp bearing xenoliths), (2) clinopyroxenites (Cpx-Sp-Grt +/- Ol +/- Opx bearing xenoliths) and (3) mafic granulites, including garnet- and corundum-bearing type (Pl-Cpx-Sp +/- Grt +/- Cor bearing xenoliths). Peridotitic xenoliths, Type 1, have characteristics of a depleted mantle provenance and are varying from lherzolite to harzburgite and dunite. Type 2 xenoliths have petrological and geochemical characteristics of a cumulate. Clinopyroxene, spinel and garnet are commonly found whereas olivine, orthopyroxene and plagioclase may be present in the nodules. Type 3 xenoliths represent another type of a cumulate rock. Based on textural and mineral chemical evidence, the cumulate type xenoliths were overprinted by a few metamorphic events.
   The whole-rock geochemistry indicates clearly a differentiation of these xenoliths. MgO contents decrease continuously from peridotite (type 1) to clinopyroxenite (type 2) and mafic granulite (type 3) xenoliths. The behavior of compatible and incompatible elements correlates well with MgO as expected for mantle rocks and crystallizing melts. PT estimates yield about 1000-1300 degrees C at 1.6-1.9 GPa for type 1 xenoliths, 950-1200 degrees C at 1.6-2.2 GPa and 700- > 1000 degrees C at 0.95-1.3 GPa for type 2 and type 3 xenoliths, respectively.
   The original ruby formation clearly relates to mafic granulite xenoliths (type 3) which appear to have formed at about 30-50 km depths before picking up and transport onto the surface via basaltic eruption.

AB We consider the problem of reconstructing unknown inclusions inside a thermal conductor from boundary measurements, which arises from active thermography and is formulated as an inverse boundary value problem for the heat equation. In our previous works, we proposed a sampling-type method for reconstructing the boundary of the unknown inclusion and gave its rigorous mathematical justification. In this paper, we continue our previous works and provide a further investigation of the reconstruction method from both the theoretical and numerical points of view. First, we analyze the solvability of the Neumann-to-Dirichlet map gap equation and establish a relation of its solution to the Green function of an interior transmission problem for the inclusion. This naturally provides a way of computing this Green function from the Neumann-to-Dirichlet map. Our new findings reveal the essence of the reconstruction method. A convergence result for noisy measurement data is also proved. Second, based on the heat layer potential argument, we perform a numerical implementation of the reconstruction method for the homogeneous inclusion case. Numerical results are presented to show the efficiency and stability of the proposed method. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Newly developed reconstructed Discontinuous Galerkin (rDG) methods are presented for solving linear advection-diffusion equations on hybrid unstructured grids based on a first-order hyperbolic system (FOHS) formulation. Benefiting from both FOHS and rDG methods, the developed hyperbolic rDG methods are reliable, accurate, efficient, and robust, achieving higher orders of accuracy than conventional DG methods for the same number of degrees-of-freedom. Superior accuracy is achieved by reconstruction of higher-order terms in the solution polynomial via gradient variables introduced to form a hyperbolic diffusion system and least-squares/variational reconstruction. Unsteady capability is demonstrated by an L-stable implicit time-integration scheme. A number of advection-diffusion test cases with a wide range of Reynolds numbers, including boundary layer type problems and unsteady cases, are presented to assess accuracy and performance of the newly developed hyperbolic rDG methods. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the hyperbolic rDG methods are able to achieve the designed optimal order of accuracy for both solutions and their derivatives on regular, irregular, and heterogeneous grids, indicating that the developed hyperbolic rDG methods provide an attractive and probably an even superior alternative for solving the linear advection-diffusion equations.

AB Numerical schemes for scalar transport and mixing in turbulent flows must be high-order accurate, and observe conservation and boundedness constraints. Discretization accuracy can be evaluated from the truncation error, and assessed by its dispersion and dissipation properties. Dispersion errors can cause violation of physical scalar bounds, whereas numerical dissipation is key to mitigating those violations. Numerical dissipation primarily alters the energy at small scales that are critical to turbulent mixing. Influence of additional dissipation on scalar mixing in large-eddy simulations (LES) of incompressible temporally evolving shear flow is examined in terms of the resolved passive-scalar field, Z. Scalar fields in flows with different mixing behavior, exhibiting both uniform and non-uniform mixed-fluid composition across a shear layer, are compared for different grid resolutions, subgrid-scale models, and scalar-convection schemes. Scalar mixing is assessed based on resolved passive scalar probability density function (PDF), variance, and spectra. The numerical-dissipation influence on mixing is found to depend on the nature of the flow. Mixing metrics sensitive to numerical dissipation are applied to examine the performance of limiting methods employed to mitigate unphysical scalar excursions. Two approaches, using a linear-scaling limiter for finite-volume schemes and a monotonicity-preserving limiter for finite-difference schemes, are studied. Their performance with respect to accuracy, conservation, and boundedness is discussed. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB In current work, transparent fluorosilicate glass-ceramics (GCs) containing NaYF4:Er3+ nanocrystals were successfully prepared by controlled heat treatment process. The thermal properties and crystallization characteristic temperatures were determined by the differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The X-ray diffraction (XRD) and transmission electron microscope (TEM) were used to confirm the formation of NaYF4 nanocrystals in glass matrix. Energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS) results and Judd-Ofelt (J-O) parameters analysis demonstrated the incorporation of Er3+ into NaYF4 nanocrystals. Intense 2.7 mu m luminescence was observed in Er3+-doped GCs upon excitation with a 980 nm laser diode (LD). Furthermore, the effect of different alkali metals (Li+, Na+, K+) on crystallization characteristics and luminescent properties has been studied in detail, which indicates Li+ is the most favorable option for mid-infrared luminescence properties compared with Na+ and K+. The excellent spectroscopic characteristics suggest that the obtained GCs may be promising materials for mid-infrared fiber lasers.

AB Phosphorus and carbon content and temperature dependence of surface tension for FeSiBPC alloy melts were investigated by sessile drop method. The surface tension of investigated alloy melts decreased firstly approaching the minimum near 1325 degrees C, and subsequently increased with raising temperature. The contact angle monotonously decreased with increasing temperature. The surface tension was weakened by the addition of phosphorus and carbon elements in FeSiB-based alloy. The wettability of the melt on the ceramic substrate was improved by the increase of carbon amount. These phenomena above were further analysed and discussed in relation to the cluster interaction, and chemical interaction between the melt and the ceramic substrate. It provides theoretical reference for the metallurgical preparation of Fe-based amorphous alloys.

AB Zr-based bulk metallic glasses (BMGs) exhibit good mechanical performance and excellent bio-compatibility. However, their high-tech application is limited due to that they are susceptible to chloride ion induced pitting corrosion. Herein, the corrosion behavior and the corresponding mechanism of the Zr65Cu17.5Al7.5Ni10-xCox (x = 0, 2, 4, 6) BMGs in the 3.5% NaCl solution were investigated. The Ni substitution by Co can contribute to significant improvements in the corrosion resistance of the Zr-Cu-Al-Ni BMG. The typical corrosion parameters such as the pitting potential and the pitting overpotential were increased from -199 and 40 mV (x = 0) to -78 and 117 mV (x = 6), respectively. Importantly, the corrosion current density was drastically decreased from 5.8 x 10(-6) (x = 0) to 3.2 x 10(-7) A/cm(2) (x = 6). The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy results demonstrated a distinct increase of the charge transfer resistance from 1.8 x 10(5) (x = 0) to 8.4 x 10(5) Omega.cm(2) (x = 6). The elemental analysis indicated that the Co substitution could facilitate the formation of stable passivation layer against chloride ion corrosion.

AB The effect of oxygen content on the glass forming ability of the Zr50Cu40Al10 alloy is presented. Two different oxygen levels, 194 +/- 26 wt. ppm and 918 +/- 72 wt. ppm, in the arc melted and suction cast alloys were obtained using Zr metal of different forms and nominal oxygen contents. Critical diameters for glass formation were determined by microstructural observations of cast conical and rod-shaped samples. Their structures were further investigated by X-ray diffraction. The critical diameter of the alloy with the lower oxygen content was 8 mm, while for the higher oxygen content it was below 3 mm. For the latter, the tau(3) (Zr51Cu28Al21) crystalline inclusions were observed in the central part of the 3 mm diameter sample. The fully amorphous samples exhibited a large supercooled liquid range and a high reduced glass transition temperature.

AB The crystallization kinetics of Ge10Se(90-x)Tlx (x = 20, 30 and 40 at. %) chalcogenide glasses have been intensively studied using non-isothermal differential thermal analysis DTA. Various models were applied to determine the average values of activation energies for the glass transition E-g and crystallization E-c processes as a function of the glass transition temperature T-g, onset crystallization temperature T-c and peak crystallization temperature T-g with heating rate alpha and Tl content. The values of E-g and E-c were found to be dependent on both of the heating rate and system composition. In Accordance with Avrami exponent n, the crystallization mechanism in the compositions Ge10Se50Tl20 and Ge10Se60Tl30 is three dimensional growth, while in Ge10Se50Tl40 is two dimensional nucleation growth. Thermal characteristics of the investigated ternary glass alloy such as fragility F-g, stability SP and glass formation ability GFA were also studied.

AB Copper phthalocyanine grafted boron nitride nano-sheet hybrids (CuPc-g-BN) were prepared for the improvement of thermal conductivity of CuPc. Hydroxyl functionalized BN (BN-OH), obtained by ball-milling of BN, was reacted with isophorone diisocyanate (IPDI) and 3-aminophenoxyphthalonitrile (3-APN) sequentially to form BN-IPDI-CN. CuPc-g-BN was prepared by in-situ polymerization of BN-IPDI-CN with 1,3,5-tri-(3,4-dicyanophenoxy) benzene (TPh) and CuCl. The CuPc-g-BN and the intermediates were characterized by TEM, AFM, XPS, FTIR and UV-vis. The results show the formation of the hybrid effectively enhances the thermal conductivity of CuPc, which is as high as 0.63 W/(m .K), with an increment of 290%, when the mass fraction of BN-IPDI-CN is 50 wt%.

AB Graphitic carbon nitride/rutile-TiO2 ( g-C3N4/r-TiO2) core-shell nanocone arrays are fabricated by pulsed laser deposition of the TiO2 layers on the g-C3N4 nanocone arrays grown by plasma sputtering reaction deposition. The optical property of the g-C3N4/r-TiO2 core-shell nanocone arrays could be adjusted through altering the TiO2-deposition duration. The photoluminescence spectra are used to illustrate the effective separation of the photogenerated carriers in the g-C3N4 nanocone arrays. On the one hand, the high surface area of the g-C3N4 nanocone arrays lead to the outstanding capacity of light harvesting. On the other hand, the band structure of r-TiO2 is well matched with that of g-C3N4, which implements the effective separation of the photogenerated carriers on the interface of the g-C3N4/r-TiO2 heterojunction.

AB In this paper, magnetic upconversion Fe3O4@SiO2@NaGdF4:Yb,Er (UCP) composite particles were prepared by Fe3O4@SiO2-NH2 nanoparticles reacting with NaGdF4:Yb, Er modified by alpha-bromoisobutyric acid for the first time. The products were characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), EDS and fluorescence spectrum. The results show that UCP composite nanoparticles have upconversion fluorescence emission peaks as NaGdF4:Yb,Er but weaker emission intensity. In contrast to NaGdF4:Yb,Er@Fe3O4 particles, UCP composite nanoparticles have better fluorescence luminescence properties, but poor magnetic properties. Biological distribution and magnetic nano-uptake of radioactive in mouse show nanomagnetic UCP particles loaded with drugs can be accumulated in the tumor site of spleen and pancreas by magnetic controlled targeting, in order to achieve drug magnetic targeted therapy.

AB A method for a significant improvement of the self-healing efficiency of Cr2AlC ceramic via pre-oxidation is presented. Micro-notches were made with the focused ion beam technique on specimens with a preexisting oxides scale followed by an oxidation healing treatment. An interesting finding is that in the former case the notches are more effectively healed by producing a dense Al2O3 layer than the counterpart specimens without a pre-existing scale. An explanation for this phenomenon is provided based transmission electron microscopy revealing a transition layer between Cr2AlC and Al2O3 with a gradient distribution of chemical composition.

AB Aluminum foam was limited when applied as load carrying structures for its lower strength. Therefore, an effective enhancement method of aluminum foam was reported in the present study by filling of 304 stainless steel tube into a pre-perforated hole and fixed by epoxy glue. The experimental results indicate that the novel tube enhanced foam (with equivalent density of foam) can doubled the specific compressive strength and energy absorption of that of aluminum foam, and even larger than that of the sum of tube and foam which were tested separately. The coupling strengthening mechanisms are suggested to be the instability limitation of steel tube due to the lateral supports (external and internal) supplied by aluminum foam.

AB Honeycomb-like porous TiO2 nanofilm was facilely prepared by a two-step self-assembly method. Firstly, a breath figure process was conducted to form an ordered composite film with micro-sized titanium salt particles in the polymer honeycomb holes. Secondly, the inorganic particles disintegrated into nano-sized particles and dispersed in water when a water drop was placed on the surface. The evaporation of water led to the formation of a "coffee ring", with a very thin layer of TiO2 precursor on the polymer film. A honeycomb-structured TiO2 nanofilm was obtained after calcination.

AB A modified coaxial electrospraying was developed to prepare structural polymeric nanocomposites, which was characterized by exploring a dilute solution without solidifiability through direct electrospraying as a shell fluid. With 0.5% (w/v) Eudragit L100 ethanol solution and a co-dissolving solution containing 10% (w/v) polyvinylpyrrolidone and 2% (w/v) diclofenac sodium (DS) in ethanol as shell and core fluids, respectively, medicated core-shell nanoparticles (NPs) were produced. These NPs had a diameter of 0.55 +/- 0.09 mu m and a homogeneous medicated core coated by a thin layer of similar to 15 nm pH-sensitive polymer. Differential scanning calorimetric analyses verified that the NPs were amorphous nanocomposites. In vitro dissolution tests demonstrated that the core-shell NPs could provide a colon-targeted pulsatile drug release profile of the loaded DS through the synergistic action of the shell nanocoating and core hydrophilic nanocomposites. The protocols reported here pave a new way for developing novel structurally functional nanomaterials by expanding the applications of shell working fluids to untreated solutions.

AB Ruddlesden Popper (RP) oxide Sr2SnO4 has been synthesized via a solid state reaction route by calcination at 1000 degrees C for 8 h. The Rietveld refinement of X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern suggested tetragonal structure; I4/mmm space group and unit cell parameters a = b = 4.05084(5) angstrom, c = 12.59040(2) angstrom. Dielectric properties, electric modulus and ac conductivity have been studied as a function of both frequency (20 Hz-2 MHz) and temperature (70-600 degrees C) in air atmosphere. Dielectric constant and dissipation factor remains constant upto 600 degrees C above 1 KHz. AC conduction mechanism has been explained using Johnscher's Power law. The value of the activation energy for conduction, E-cond (obtained from DC conductivity) and dielectric relaxation, E-relax (obtained from modulus) is found to be the same indicating similar mechanism for both the processes. Based on the numerical value of activation energy, the conduction and relaxation processes are attributed to transfer of electron from Sn2+ to Sn4+ through the thermally assisted quantum mechanical tunneling process.

AB We propose electrospun-nanofiber diffusing films to enhance the angular color uniformity (ACU) of remote-phosphor-converted light-emitting diodes (RPC-LEDs). Poly(vinylidene fluoride) electrospun nanofibers/acrylic composite films with different nanofiber thicknesses are investigated. An optimal composite film is obtained based on the balance between the ACU enhancement and luminous flux reduction, which can be applied to RPC-LEDs with different correlated color temperatures (CCTs) to enhance the ACU with a small luminous-flux loss, particularly at higher CCTs. Therefore, the composite films can effectively enhance the ACU of RPC-LEDs while maintaining a high luminous flux. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB BaTiO3 films with novel nano-periodic structures were prepared by a sol-gel template synthesis. A through-hole type anodic aluminum oxide film was used as a template. The nano-periodic structure was drastically modified by applying a spray cleaning process during spin-coating of the template with a BaTiO3 sol. The formation mechanism was discussed from the viewpoint of liquid bridge force and surface tension applied during the drying process. The novel structures are promising for various functional devices, in which the nano-periodicity improves their performance. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A direct preparation of complete lath martensite microstructure (transformation rate delta > 99%) in tool steel was successfully realized using selective laser melting (SLM) in conjunction with laser remelting (LR) technique. Ultrafine lath martensite with a high percentage of low-angle grain boundaries (LAGBs) (46.12%) was formed. This unique microstructure contributed to the prominent effect of dislocation rearrangement and entanglement within the substructure of martensite, leading to a significant improvement of mechanical properties. An ultrahigh microhardness of similar to 765.1 HV0.3 was obtained, which is much higher than the previously reported values of as-built SLM hardened steel such as H13 and maraging steel.

AB In this study, we report a novel and efficient way to produce large-area graphene and syngas simultaneously from CH4 and CO2 via CVD. The successful synthesis of syngas was confirmed by online gas chromatography characterization whereas the graphene produced within the same process was verified using Raman spectroscopy, Raman mapping and HRTEM. This work helps to better understand graphene growth from CH4 and CO2 and improve the CVD method by providing a novel pathway for the synthesis of large-area graphene with a valued by-product. With our derived CVD approach, graphene was grown while producing syngas and consuming green-house gases which is of great importance in this current climate change phenomenon.

AB In this paper the amino-modified mesoporous silica (SBA-NH2) was investigated as a potential bifunctional drug delivery system for cefazolin with both prolonged drug release and mineralization properties. The primary SBA-15 was synthesized using sol-gel method and surface functionalization was carried out using post-synthesis grafting. The obtained SBA-NH2 was characterized by higher adsorption efficiency of cefazolin with drug release prolonged to 7 days compared to primary SBA-15. The amino-modified SBA-15 exhibited also mineralization potential after immersion in simulated body fluid (SBF) with delayed hydroxycarbonate apatite (HCA) formation compared to SBA-15 which did not interrupt the cefazolin release in controlled manner. A bone-mineral-mimicking layer of HCA was formed on the SBA-NH2 surface after 28 days in SBF. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The reduced elastic modulus of a material is measured with a nanoindenter probe that is operated in the tapping mode. The resonant frequency of a freely oscillating cantilever is reduced when contact is made between the indenter tip and surface under investigation. It's shown using elasticity theory that the elastic deformation is a function of the indenter tip radius. A deeper penetration within the elastic range can change the tip radius, and introduce an error of 10% in calculating the reduced elastic modulus. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Exploring the diversified application of materials can fully tap the available value of material. Herein, first we synthesized polypyrrole/graphene aerogel (PGA) with in-situ polymerization, and then applying to supercapacitors and three-dimensional (3D) electrocatalysis system. The electrical capacity reached 347.71F/g at 5 mV/s and satisfactory cycling stability (retaining 95.0% after 2000 cycles). The 3D electrode system showed excellent catalytic performance that the removal rate of Cr(VI) reached nearly 100% within 60 min along with superb repeatability. Furthermore, spent PGA from supercapacitors was recycled and reused as particle electrodes, and found that the reclaimed PGA still had very high activity. This work also provided a new way for the reutilization of waste materials from supercapacitors. Anyhow, excellent performance proved that PGA was an appropriate material in electrochemical fields.

AB Many failures and anomalies of spacecrafts originated from space environmental factors. Meanwhile, MoS2 based films have been widely used in space technology as solid lubricants. In this paper, the compact MoS2-Sb2O3 composite film was rf-sputtered and exposed in low earth orbit (LEO) environment, which was aboard the exterior of Shenzhou-7 Manned Spaceship (SZMS-7). The results revealed that the space exposure effect on MoS2-Sb2O3 composite film mainly exhibited the oxidation at the film surface layer less than 3.5 nm. No severe oxidation and cracking phenomena were observed from the space-exposed MoS2-Sb2O3 composite film, which was normal for many space materials. Namely, the MoS2-Sb2O3 composite film exhibited a better capability resistant to LEO space environment. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A new phenylboronic acid functionalized reduced graphene oxide probe (BA-FITC@rGO) for detecting the sialic acid (SA) is synthesized by a simple and cost-effective method. First, fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) and 3-aminophenylboronic acid (BA) were combined to obtain a compound BA-FITC. Second, rGO was added to get the probe (BA-FITC@rGO). Then, this probe was used to detect the SA content in a buffer of pH = 7.40 by spectra analysis. BA-FITC@rGO can be used to detect whether the SA content is normal according to SA threshold in normal human serum. With high sensitivity and excellent specificity, this spectral method provides an attractive and novel idea for rapid detection of SA in body's blood serum. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

ID PERFORMANCE
AB A novel metal-free conductive catalyst is designed based on N-doped core-shell carbon spheres (N-CCS) with rich active sites. Furthermore, the doping of N atoms activated the fully interconnected mesoporous basal planes of carbon spheres. Corresponding electrochemistry (Cyclic voltammetry, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, and Tafel polarization measurements) test discovered the excellent electrocatalytic activities in the I /I-3 redox reaction of dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs), suggesting to result from the improvement of the surface electronic properties of CCS. DSSCs with N-CCS as the counter electrode (CE) achieve power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 7.89%, higher than to Pt's value (7.48%) in the same test environment, demonstrating as a hopeful catalyst for low-cost DSSCs.

AB The carboxylic acid (formic acid and oxalic acid) surface-modification was applied on Cu nanoparticles (NPs) to remove surface oxidation. The synthesized Cu NPs were soaked in the mixture of carboxylic acid and dehydrated ethanol for surface-modification. The reliable Cu-Cu bonding joints using formic acid and oxalic acid surface-modified Cu NPs were achieved at 250 degrees C, and the shear strengths were improved to 20.2 MPa and 32.4 MPa, respectively. The bonded Cu NPs layer exhibited obvious sintering necks and ductile characteristics. The experimental results demonstrated that low temperature bonding using carboxylic acid surface-modified Cu NPs had the potential to fulfill the requirements of three-dimensional (3D) integration.

AB Tricalcium silicate (C3S) powders were successfully prepared via a novel and facile wet-chemical route with CaC2O4 and Si(OC2H5)(4) (TEOS) as raw materials. Pure C3S powders with small particle size could be synthesized at 1400 degrees C for 6 h. The effects of sintering temperatures on the particle size distribution of C3S powders were also investigated. The results revealed that the mean particle sizes of different sintered C3S powders were 2.11, 2.23, 2.92 and 4.01 mu m at sintering temperatures of 1300 degrees C, 1350 degrees C, 1400 degrees C and 1450 degrees C, with the specific surface areas of 2850, 2700, 2060 and 1500 m(2)/kg, respectively. The results indicated that the variations of sintering temperature had a great influence on the particle size: higher temperatures improve diffusion of ions to the interstitial sites and therefore a faster grain growth.

ID SLIDING WEAR; COMPOSITE
AB Dry sliding wear behavior of ultrafine-grained (UFG) AZ31B magnesium alloy processed by high pressure torsion (HPT) has been investigated against bearing steel ball at room temperature. The HPT process progressed with formation of twins (at number of torsional turns N = 0), subgrains (N = 1/4) and high angle boundaries (recrystallized, grain size similar to 115 +/- 21 nm, at N = 5). With the progression of HPT, hardness of the sample increased and wear rate decreased, involving abrasive, oxidative and adhesive mechanisms in all cases. A distinct feature was formation of lathy strips, whose length increased by as much as similar to 1 mm with HPT torsional rotations N = 0 and 1/4, but diminished after N = 5 to similar to 200 mu m. The lengthy lathy strips were due to twins and shear bands (which favours crack propagation path) inside larger grains, but diminished because of very fine grains size. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB Low-loss gallium(Ga3+)-diffused erbium(Er3+)-doped LiTaO3(Ga:Er:LiTaO3) channel waveguide was fabricated using erbium metal film diffusion followed by photolithographically patterned gallium oxide(Ga2O3) strip diffusion. Secondary ion mass spectrometry analysis shows that Er3+ concentration follows a Gaussian profile, Ga3+ concentration follows a sum of two error functions at the waveguide surface and a Gaussian profile in the depth direction. Optical studies show that the waveguide supports single-mode propagation at 1.5 mu m wavelength with a coupling loss <1 dB and a waveguide loss 0.2 (0.3) dB/cm for the TE(TM) mode, and with a small polarization dependence in mode field distribution. Stable optical gain of similar to 1.0 dB/cm was measured at 1547 nm wavelength with 220 mW pump power of 980 nm wavelength, indicating good photorefractive damage resistance of the waveguide.

AB A new type of TiO2 photoanode containing upconversion luminescence materials Y2O3:Er3+ nanorods is developed, which is effective to enhance the photoelectric conversion efficiency of dye-sensitized solar cell. The Y2O3:Er3+ nanorods are synthesized using a hydrothermal process and the photoandodes are prepared via coating the TiO2 (P25) and Y2O3:Er3+ mixture with various Y2O3:Er3+ concentrations on the fluorine doped tin oxide (FTO) substrates. We show that the TiO2 photoanode with an Y2O3:Er3+ concentration of 4% exhibits the highest photoelectric conversion efficiency (7.80%), which is 43.6% higher than that of the pure P25 photoanode (5.43%). This great enhancement is attributed to the additional, useful photons converted from infrared (IR) photons in sun light by the doped Y2O3:Er3+ upconversion nanorods. In addition, the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analysis demonstrates that the doping of Y2O3:Er3+ improves the charge transfer and electron lifetime of the dye-sensitized solar cell.

In this letter, we reported anomalous nontetragonality of martensite in carbon steels by deforming quenched martensite, indicating that the disordering of interstitial carbon atoms in alpha-Fe lattice occurs under mechanical deformation. This order-disorder transition of interstitial carbon atoms in carbon steels provides solid experimental evidences of the prediction based on microscopic elasticity theory. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB Vanadium oxyhydroxide VO(OH)(2), which may possess specific chemical and physical properties, has been paid less attention comparing with vanadium oxides. Herein, with the assistance of polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP) and by adjusting pH about 4.7, VO(OH)(2) was successfully synthesized by a facile hydrothermal method for the first time, which were short nanorods with widths of 50-130 nm and lengths of 250-500 nm. Electrochemical performance of VO(OH)(2) nanorods was firstly investigated as supercapacitor electrodes, which were studied by cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge-discharge (GCD) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). VO(OH)(2) nanorods showed capacitive behavior based on pseudocapacitance and superior rate capability. Specific capacitance of 198 F.g (1) was achieved at 0.5 A.g (1). These findings suggested that VO(OH)(2) nanorods can be promising candidate as potential material for supercapacitor electrode. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Single-phase Bi5Ti3FeO15 (BTFO) ceramics were synthesized by hot-pressing sintering process using solgel derived fine powders. X-ray diffraction indicates that the ceramics have expected four-layered Aurivillius structure with an orthorhombic symmetry. The ceramics are very dense and consist of plate-like grains. The BTFO ceramics exhibit typical ferroelectric hysteresis loops with a remnant polarization 2P(r) of 14.1 mu C/cm(2) and a coercive field 2E(c) of 142 kV/cm. Their dielectric constant and dissipation factor at 100 kHz are about 152.8 and 0.007, respectively. The remanent magnetization 2M(r) of the BTFO ceramics is about 3.0 memu/g at room temperature. Both the dielectric loss and magnetic properties of the present BTFO ceramics are enhanced compared to those for pressureless sintered BTFO ceramics. This work provides a flexible way to fabricate high-performance multiferroic ceramics at room temperature. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

DE Pechini method; Perovskite; Cerium niobate; CeNb3O9
AB Pechini method was applied for the first time to synthesize CeNb3O9 perovskite at different calcination temperatures (600, 800 and 1000 degrees C). A solution of water, citric acid, ethylene glycol, ammonium niobium oxalate and cerium ions was polymerized and calcined at 300 degrees C for 2 h. The precursor gels were submitted to a second calcination at 600, 800 and 1000 degrees C to obtain perovskite at different temperatures. These materials were characterized through X-ray diffraction (XRD), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), N-2 physisorption, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) coupled with energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS-UVvis) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). Results showed the formation of perovskite only at 1000 degrees C and Nb2O5-CeO2 mixed oxides at lower temperatures with some interesting characteristics. Pechini technique allows the synthesis of cerium niobate perovskite at lower temperatures than those presented in the literature (prepared by different methods). (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

ID VISIBLE-LIGHT; IRRADIATION
AB Highly dispersed TiO2-modified Bi2WO6 microflowers were synthesized by using the hydrothermal method. The morphology and structure of as-prepared samples were characterized by SEM, TEM, EDS, XRD, Raman, UV-vis DRS, and TR-PL spectra. The heterostructured TiO2/Bi2WO6 exhibits a higher photocatalytic activity than pure TiO2 and Bi2WO6 under visible and UV-vis light irradiation. In addition, the recycling experiments indicate that TiO2/Bi2WO6 is excellent stability even after 5 five cycling runs. TR-PL spectra confirm that the coupling of Bi2WO6 with TiO2 significantly prolongs the lifetime of charge carriers. The enhanced photocatalytic activity of TiO2/Bi2WO6 is mainly attributed to the optimized band-gap and heterojunction, which absorb more visible light and prolong the carrier lifetime.

ID BEHAVIOR
AB This letter reports that a plasticized poly vinyl chloride (PVC) exhibits high dielectric constant with low Young's modulus which drastically improves its piezoelectric property and strain sensing behavior. PVC was plasticized by poly[di(ethylene glycol) adipate] (PDEGA) and PDEGA-PVC was fabricated by simple solvent mixing process. As increasing the PDEGA content, the dielectric constant of PDEGA-PVC increases meanwhile its Young's modulus and yield strength decrease, which results in great improvement of the piezoelectric charge constant of PDEGA-PVC (51.2 pC/N), much higher than the pristine PVC (0.34 pC/N). A strain sensor with PDEGA-PVC was tested and its durable strain sensing behavior is demonstrated. The developed PDEGA- PVC is applicable for sensors of wearable and portable devices and soft actuators. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID SOLAR-CELLS; CS2AGBIBR6
AB First-principles density functional theory calculations were employed to study the structural, electronic, elastic and optical properties of lead free perovskites Cs2AgBiX6 (X = Cl, Br and I) in the cubic phase. Calculations were performed with spin-orbit coupling (SOC) for predicting the accurate band gap and comparison is made with calculations excluding SOC. The calculated band gaps for Cs2AgBiCl6, Cs2AgBiBr6 and Cs2AgBiI6 are 1.91 eV, 1.42 eV and 0.89 eV respectively and are in good agreement with reported theoretical and experimental results. It is evident from the partial density of state diagrams that the anti-bonding Ag/5s and Bi/6p states to the halogen 3p/4p states are involved in the transition from conduction to valence band and this interaction leads to an indirect band gap. Variations in the structural, mechanical, optical and electronic properties of the lead free halide double perovskites Cs2AgBiX6 under various exchange correlations are fully investigated. Our studies provide theoretical support for their potential optoelectronic application in solar energy conversion. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The visible-light-driven Bi2MoO6/Ag3PO4/RGO composites were fabricated by a facile in situ precipitation and hydrothermal method and characterized. The as-synthesized Bi2MoO6 appears a sheet-like structure, while the cubic Ag3PO4 nanocrystals attached on the surface of Bi2MoO6 with an average diameter of about 10 nm. Both Bi2MoO6 and Ag3PO4 distributed well on the graphene oxide (GO) sheets, which can potentially improve the separation efficiency of photogenerated electron-hole pairs. Additionally, the high-surface-area GO sheets enhanced adsorption of dye molecules, and the photodegradation efficiency of reactive blue 19 (RB-19) dye under visible-light irradiation was as high as 98% in 3 h for Bi2MoO6/Ag3PO4/RGO heterostructure composite. Therefore, the Bi2MoO6/Ag3PO4/RGO photocatalyst can be a favorable alternative for practical use in environmental photocatalysis. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) as a nanocarbon material has attracted accelerated concern because of its layered structure, facile synthesis route and lower capital cost. Here, three kinds of g-C3N4 are fabricated via simply thermal polycondensation of dicyandiamide, melamine, and urea at high temperature, and they are applied for elemental mercury (Hg-0) capture in a fixed-bed reactor. We found that the g-C3N4 attained by urea pyrolysis exhibited prominent Hg-0 capture ability with Hg-0 removal efficiency of similar to 84% which is much higher than that of the g-C3N4 derived from dicyandiamide and melamine pyrolysis, probably attributed to its bigger BET surface area and pore volume.

AB We proposed and examined a material group of methylammonium Pb-Sn mixed halide (MAPb(1-x)Sn(x)I(2.6)Br(0.4)) with various Sn-content (x = 0.2-0.8) for Pb-reduced perovskite solar cells. With suitable Pb-Sn ratio (x = 0.4-0.6), dense coverage of films with better crystallinity was obtained compared with low Sn ratio (x = 0.2). For excess Sn ratio (x = 0.8), poor film-uniformity was found in spite of its enhanced crystallinity. Optimum composition (x = 0.6) provided an impressive power conversion efficiency of 13.4% with remarkable photocurrent output stability, which is related to suppression of trap-assisted recombination regarding the perovskite materials. This promising material paves the way for development of highly efficient, Pb-reduced perovskite photovoltaic cells. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this article, we report the green, simple and large-scale ultrasonic synthesis of nanocomposites of graphene oxide with three-dimensional two-fold interpenetration azine-functionalized MOF, TMU-16/GO(n) (n = the percentage of GO), at room temperature and atmospheric pressure. The materials were characterized by FT-IR, SEM, PXRD, Raman spectroscopy and nitrogen adsorption. The presence of GO significantly changes the morphologies of the composites and decreases their surface area. It is expected that TMU-16/GO(n) nanocomposites may find wide forthcoming industrial and technological applications in electrochemistry, gas adsorption and catalysts.

AB Wistar rats were administered increasing doses of Russell's viper venom (RVV; 0.025-0.4 mg/kg) intraperitoneally to investigate acute kidney injury (AKI) by measuring creatinine (1.5-fold increase in serum creatinine above baseline) and examining kidney histology. Approximately 50% of rats receiving 0.25 0.4 mg/ kg venom died within 72 h. An increase in serum creatinine only occurred at a venom dose of 0.4 mg/kg, except in two rats. Acute tubular necrosis, glomerular necrosis, cortical necrosis and interstitial inflammation were observed at venom doses of >= 0.25 mg/kg in 12/36 rats. However, of those 12 rats only four survived to 48 h compared to the 24 rats not developing nephrotoxicity, in which 18 were alive at 48 h. There was poor correlation between histological nephrotoxicity and AKI based on creatinine measurement. The early death in rats with AKI makes this a poor model for studying RVV-induced AKI.

AB The aim of this study was to determine whether exposure to low doses of zearalenone (ZEN) induces changes in the serum biochemical profile and body weights (BW). Pre-pubertal gilts (with BW of up to 14.5 kg) were administered ZEN in daily doses of 5 mu g/kg BW (group 1, n = 15), 10 mu g/kg BW (group 2, n = 15), 15 mu g/kg BW (group 3, n = 15) or placebo (control group C, n = 15) throughout the experiment. Blood was sampled for analysis on 10 dates (at five-day intervals). Minor but statistically significant differences in the analysed serum biochemical parameters (ALT, AST, ALP, total cholesterol, total bilirubin, glucose, total protein, iron, BUN and urea) were observed in the studied groups. The biochemical parameters of the analysed gilts indicate that the maintenance of homeostasis and biotransformation of ZEN require considerable energy expenditure. Beginning on the fourth analytical date, BW gains were consistently higher in the experimental groups than in group C. The observed decrease in glucose and total protein levels can probably be attributed to higher BW gains and the ongoing ZEN biotransformation processes in the enterocytes and the liver.

AB The therapeutic effect of the Light Emitting Diode (LED) treatment in two wavelengths (635 or 945 nm) was evaluated in the local pathological alterations induced by Bothrops asper snake venom. Mice received irradiation of infrared LED (120 mW, 945 nm) or red LED (110 mW, 635 nm) applied immediately, 1 and 2 h after venom injection. LED treatment reduced edema formation in the plantar region and gastrocnemius muscle and significantly reduced neutrophil migration and hyperalgesia after the venom injection. Also, both infrared LED and red LED treatment significantly reduced myonecrosis, as revealed by muscle CK and plasma CK levels. Histological analysis corroborated the reduction in the extent of venom-induced myonecrosis. In conclusion, our data demonstrates that PBM with LED light in both red and infrared wavelengths, when applied after envenomation in mice, reduces the extent of myotoxicity, edema, inflammatory infiltrate and hyperalgesia, suggesting that photobiomodulation is a potential therapeutic approach that should be further investigated for the treatment of local effects of Bothrops snakebite.

AB Sex-biased genes are expressed at higher levels in one sex and contribute to phenotypic differences between males and females, as well as overall phenotypic variation within and among populations. Venom has evolved primarily for predation and defense, making venom expression a highly variable phenotype as a result of local adaptation. Several scorpion species have shown both intraspecific and intersexual venom variation, and males have been observed using venom in courtship and mating, suggesting the existence of venom-specific, sex-biased genes that may contribute to population divergence. We used reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC), Agilent protein bioanalyzer chips, nano-liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (nLC/MS/MS), and median lethal dose (LD50) assays in fruit flies (Drosophila melanogaster) and banded crickets (Gryllodes sigillatus) to investigate proteomic and functional venom variation within and among three Florida populations of the Hentz striped scorpion (Centruroides hentzi). We found significant venom variation among populations, with females, not males, being responsible for this divergence. We also found significant variation in venom expression within populations, with males contributing more to within population variation than females. Our results provide evidence that male and female scorpions experience different natural and sexual selective pressures that have led to the expression of sex-biased venom genes and that these genes may be consequential in population divergence.

AB beta-Methylamino-L-alanine (BMAA) has been identified as the potential cause of the amyotrophic lateral sclerosis/parkinsonism-dementia complex (ALS/PDC) observed in the Chamorro people of Guam. The principal hypothesis for BMAA exposure and intoxication relies on the biomagnification of BMAA in flying fox specimens ingested by the Chamorro people. Although high levels of BMAA were quantitated in flying fox specimens utilizing liquid chromatography-fluorescence (LC-FL), there have not been any confirmatory analyses conducted to date. Therefore, a method for the tissue homogenization, extraction and direct analysis of BMAA (including BAMA, 2,4-DAB and AEG) was utilized. The approach was applied to mammalian dried skin and hair from various rodent species (negative controls) and archived flying fox (Pteropus mariannus mariannus) specimens. A positive control sample of homogenized mussel (Mytelius edulis) with native BMAA was used to verify the method. It was determined that the direct analysis using HILIC MS/MS required additional quality control in order to allow for the confident identification of BMAA due to the near co-elution of BAMA. BMAA was not present above 0.2 mu g g(-1) (free fraction) or 2.8 mu g g(-1) (total fraction) in the flying fox specimens. While analysis did not result in BMAA detection in flying fox or negative control samples, the positive control sample and spiked samples were successfully detected.

AB The large lungworms of the genus Dictyocaulus are causative agents of parasitic bronchitis in various ungulate hosts, including red deer. Recently, the red deer-derived lungworm D. cervi was described and separated from D. eckerti. Little is known of the transmission patterns, epidemiology, geographical distribution and pathogenicity of D. cervi. Histological examinations were performed on 22 formalin-fixed lung tissue samples of hunted red deer. Exclusively, D. cervi adults were derived from 15 red deer and confirmed molecularly (GenBank accession: MH183394). Dictyocaulus cervi infection was associated with various degrees of lung pathology, including interstitial pneumonia, bronchitis and bronchiolitis with an influx of eosinophils, lymphocytes, plasma cells and macrophages; massive hyperplasia of lymphoid follicles within bronchiolar tissue, and hyperplasia of the bronchial and bronchiolar epithelium. Furthermore, emphysema, atelectasis and lung tissue congestion were noted. Interestingly, interstitial and subpleural fibrosis was seen in adult Dictyocaulus-negative samples, suggesting either a prepatent phase of Dictyocaulus infection or infection/coinfection with protostrongylid nematodes.

AB This study aimed to determine the composition of essential oils from Arisaema anurans and to evaluate the acaricidal activity of the oil and its major components on the cattle tick Rhipicephalus microplus. The essential oil was characterized by high-level oxygenated terpenes and phenylpropanoids. Its major chemical compounds were found to be asarone (11.08%), cubenol (8.43%), guaiol (4.73%), eugenol (3.46%), linalool (3.41%), and alpha-bisabolol (3.29%). Adult immersion test revealed that the oil, asarone, and cubenol at 1.60% concentration presented oviposition reduction percentages of 36.3%, 44.2%, and 17.7%; hatching reductions percentages of 40.8%, 51.0%, and 35.1%; and final efficacy percentages of 65.0%, 73.2%, and 49.6%, respectively. Dose dependent egg hatching inhibition activities were exhibited by the oil, asarone, and cubenol, with LC50 values (in w/v) of 0.174%, 0.180%, and 0.381%, respectively. Larval immersion test further revealed considerable larvicidal activities against R. microplus of the oil, asarone, and cubenol, with LC50 values of 0.147%, 0.115%, and 0.338%, respectively. Biochemical assay of the homogenate of R. microplus revealed multiple mechanisms of acaricidal activity of A. anurans essential oil.

AB Repurposing of currently marketed compounds with proven efficacy against apicomplexan parasites was used as an approach to define novel candidate therapeutics for bovine besnoitiosis. Besnoitia besnoiti tachyzoites grown in MARC-145 cells were exposed to different concentrations of toltrazuril, diclazuril, imidocarb, decoquinate, sulfadiazine and trimethoprim alone or in combination with sulfadiazine. Drugs were added either just prior to infection of MARC-145 cells (0 h post infection, hpi) or at 6 hpi. A primary evaluation of drug effects was done by direct immunofluorescence staining and counting. Potential effects on the host cells were assessed using a XTT kit for cell proliferation. Compounds displaying promising efficacy were selected for IC50 and IC99 determination by qPCR. In addition, the impact of drugs on the tachyzoite ultrastructure was assessed by TEM and long-term treatment assays were performed. Cytotoxicity assays confirmed that none of the compounds affected the host cells. Decoquinate and diclazuril displayed invasion inhibition rates of 90 and 83% at 0 h pi and 73 and 72% at 6 h pi, respectively. The remaining drugs showed lower efficacy and were not further studied. Decoquinate and diclazuril exhibited IC99 values of 100 nM and 29.9 mu M, respectively. TEM showed that decoquinate primarily affected the parasite mitochondrium, whilst diclazuril interfered in cytokinesis of daughter zoites. The present study demonstrates the efficacy of diclazuril and decoquinate against B. besnoid in vitro and further assessments of safety and efficacy of both drugs should be performed in the target species.

AB Canine visceral leishmaniosis (CVL), a parasitic disease caused by Leishmania infantum, may evolve to a chronic condition and lead to death. Evaluation of infected dogs is important to establish the clinical and laboratory parameters involved in the evolution of the disease. The objectives of the present study were to discriminate a canine population (n = 52) into sub-clinical and clinically affected dogs based on signs and scores, to evaluate the hematological, biochemical, histopathological and parasitological parameters of the two dog groups, and to analyze the results by multivariate regression analysis with the aim of establishing biomarkers of CVL clinical disease. The most common signs observed in the clinically affected dogs (n = 29) were hyperkeratosis, weight loss, onychogryphosis, pale mucosa and lymphadenomegaly. In the multivariate analysis, animals presenting high IgG avidity index and low red blood, lymphocyte and eosinophil counts, and low serum urea concentration had an increased probability of being classified as clinically affected (p < 0.05). All five parameters were considered to be strong biomarkers for monitoring the clinical disease, while IgG avidity percentage was strongly correlated with the number of clinical signs and could function as an indicator of the duration of infection. This is the first report on the application of IgG avidity and of multivariate regression analysis in establishing associations between the clinical signs of CVL and host biomarkers. Since avidity index (Al) percentages were strongly correlated with the number of clinical signs, it could be useful in clinical practice for auxiliary diagnosis of CVL and monitoring disease progression. A limitation of this study is the lack of information on co-infections by Anaplasma platys, Babesia conic vogeli, Ehrlichia canis and Hepatozoon conic. Therefore future studies should evaluate the influence of such co-infections on the associations studied using multivariate methods with larger samples.

AB This study constructed a 1000 L modularized MFC system, the largest volume so far, to treat practical municipal wastewater. This MFC system was operated under two different water flow connections in two municipal wastewater treatment plants (MWTP) for more than one year to test their treating abilities for wastewater with both low (average 80 mg L-1) and high initial COD concentration (average 250 mg L-1). The COD concentration in the effluent from the MFC system remained below 50 mg L-1 with a removal rate of 70-90%, which stably met the level A of the first class in discharge standard of pollutants for MWTP of China. A maximum power density of 125 W m(-3) (7.58 W m(-2)) was generated when the MFC system was fed with artificial wastewater, while it lay in a range of 7-60 W m(-3) (0.42-3.64 W m(-2)) when treating municipal wastewater. The energy recovery of 0.033 +/- 0.005 kWh per m(3) of municipal wastewater was achieved, with a hydraulic retention time (HRT) of 2 h. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The recently developed Denitrifying Sulfur conversion-associated Enhanced Biological Phosphorus Removal (DS-EBPR) process has demonstrated simultaneous removal of organics, nitrogen and phosphorus with minimal sludge production in the treatment of saline/brackish wastewater. Its performance, however, is sensitive to operating and environmental conditions. In this study, the effects of temperature (20, 25, 30 and 35 degrees C) and the ratio of influent acetate to propionate (100-0, 75-25, 50-50, 25-75 and 0 - 100%) on anaerobic metabolism were investigated, and their optimal values/controls for performance optimization were identified. A mature DS-EBPR sludge enriched with approximately 30% sulfate reducing bacteria (SRB) and 33% sulfide-oxidizing bacteria (SOB) was used in this study. The anaerobic stoichiometry of this process was insensitive to temperature or changes in the carbon source. However, an increase in temperature from 20 to 35 degrees C accelerated the kinetic reactions of the functional bacteria (i.e. SRB and SOB) and raised the energy requirement for their anaerobic maintenance, while a moderate temperature (25-30 degrees C) resulted in better P removal (>= 93%,18.6 mg P/L removal from total 20 mg P/L in the influent) with a maximum sulfur conversion of approximately 16 mg S/L. These results indicate that the functional bacteria are likely to be mesophilic. When a mixed carbon source (75-25 and 50-50% acetate to propionate ratios) was supplied, DS-EBPR achieved a stable P removal (>= 89%, 17.8 mg P/L for 400 mg COD/L in the influent) with sulfur conversions at around 23 mg S/L, suggesting the functional bacteria could effectively adapt to changes in acetate or propionate as the carbon source. The optimal temperatures or carbon source conditions maximized the functional bacteria competition against glycogen-accumulating organisms by favoring their activity and synergy. Therefore, the DS-EBPR process can be optimized by setting the temperature in the appropriate range (25-30 degrees C) and/or manipulating influent carbon sources. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Due to their widespread application in consumer products, elemental titanium (e.g., titanium dioxide, TiO2) and silver (Ag), also in nanoparticulate form, are increasingly released from households and industrial facilities to urban wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). A seven-day sampling campaign was conducted in two full-scale WWTPs in Trondheim (Norway) employing only primary treatment. We assessed the occurrence and elimination of Ti and Ag, and conducted size-based fractionation using sequential filtration of influent samples to separate particulate, colloidal and dissolved fractions. Eight hour composite influent samples were collected to assess diurnal variations in total Ti and Ag influx. Measured influent Ti concentrations (up to 290 mu g L-1) were significantly higher than Ag (<0.15 -2.1 mu g L-1), being mostly associated with suspended solids (>0.7 mu m). Removal efficiencies >= 70% were observed for both elements, requiring for one WWTP to account for the high Ti content (similar to 2 g L-1) in the flocculant. Nano- and micron-sized Ti particles were observed with scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) in influent, effluent and biosolids, while Ag nanoparticles were detected in biosolids only. Diurnal profiles of influent Ti were correlated to flow and pollutant concentration patterns (especially total suspended solids), with peaks during the morning and/or evening and minima at night, indicating household discharges as predominant source. Irregular profiles were exhibited by influent Ag, with periodic concentration spikes suggesting short-term discharges from one or few point sources (e.g., industry). Influent Ti and Ag dynamics were reproduced using a disturbance scenario generator model, and we estimated per capita loads of Ti (42-45 mg cap(-1) d(-1)) and Ag (0.11 mg cap(-1) d(-1)) from households as well as additional Ag load (14-22 g d(-1)) from point discharge. This is the first study to experimentally and mathematically describe short-term release dynamics and dry-weather sources of emissions of Ti and Ag in municipal WWTPs and receiving environments.

AB Simultaneous chlorine decay and disinfection byproduct (DBP) formation have been discussed extensively because of their regulatory and operational significance. This study further examines chemical reaction variability in the water quality changes under various hydrodynamic conditions in drinking water distribution. The variations of kinetic constant for overall chlorine decay (k(E)) and trihalomethane (THM) formation were determined under stagnant to turbulent flows using three devices of different wall demand and two types of natural organic matters (NOM) in water. The results from the comparative experiments and modeling analyses show the relative importance of wall demand (k(w)), DBP-forming chlorine decay (k(D)), and other bulk demand (k(b)') for pipe flows of Re 0-52500. It is found that chlorine reactivity of virgin NOM is the overriding factor. Secondly, for tap water NOM of lower reactivity, pipe flow properties (Re or u) can significantly affect kE, the THM yield (7), formation potential (Y), and the time to reach the maximum THM concentration (t(max)) through their influence on kinetic ratio k(D)/(k(b)' + k(w)). These observations, corroborating with turbidity variations during experiments, cannot be explained alone by chlorine dispersion to and from the pipe wall. Mass exchanges through deposition and scale detachment, most likely being flow-dependent, may have contributed to the overall chlorine decay and DBP formation rates. Thus for the simultaneous occurrence of chlorine decay and DBP formation, model considerations of NOM reactivity, pipe types (wall demand), flow hydraulics, and their interactions are essential.

AB Cryptosporidium and Giardia are critical parasites in the etiology of diarrhea worldwide, and often cause waterborne outbreaks. The presence of Cryptosporidium and Giardia in recreational lakes was investigated with molecular characterization, and a comprehensive quantitative microbial risk assessment (QMRA) of protozoan infections was performed, considering multiple exposure pathways, differences in age, sex, and disease severity, and the genotypes of the protozoa. Forty-three (82.7%) and 51 (98.1%) water samples were positive for Cryptosporidium oocysts and Giardia cysts, respectively, with average counts of 3.65 oocysts/10 L and 12.58 cysts/10 L, respectively. Six Cryptosporidium species and three Giardia lamblia assemblages were confirmed with molecular analyses. The protozoan concentration was significantly associated with water turbidity, but not with the total coliform numbers. Swimming in the lakes entailed the highest incidence risk of 5.72 x 10(-4) per person per year (pppy) (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.03-4333 x 10(-4)) for Cryptosporidium and 4.04 x 10(-4) pppy (95% CI: 0.01-32.66 x 10(-4)) for Giardia, whereas wading entailed the lowest risk (2.20 x 10(-4) and 1.70 x 10(-4) pppy, respectively). The annual burdens attributable to recreational-water-associated cryptosporidiosis and giardiasis were 3.44 (95% CI: 0.04-23.51) and 1.81 (95% CI: 0.01-12.96) disability-adjusted life years per 1,000,000 individuals per year, respectively. Children were more likely to have an individual disease burden than adults, and males were more likely than females. Sensitivity analysis highlighted the great importance of controlling the proportion of exposed individuals and reducing the frequency of exposure. The methodology and results of this study will allow us to better evaluate and reduce the burden of Cryptosporidium and/or Giardia infections associated with recreational water use in China and other countries.

AB Understanding the temporal dynamics of multi-species biofilms in Drinking Water Distribution Systems (DWDS) is essential to ensure safe, high quality water reaches consumers after it passes through these high surface area reactors. This research studied the succession characteristics of fungal and bacterial communities under controlled environmental conditions fully representative of operational DWDS.
   Microbial communities were observed to increase in complexity after one month of biofilm development but they did not reach stability after three months. Changes in cell numbers were faster at the start of biofilm formation and tended to decrease over time, despite the continuing changes in bacterial community composition. Fungal diversity was markedly less than bacterial diversity and had a lag in responding to temporal dynamics. A core-mixed community of bacteria including Pseudomonas, Massillia and Sphingomonas and the fungi Acremonium and Neocosmopora were present constantly and consistently in the biofilms over time and conditions studied.
   Monitoring and managing biofilms and such ubiquitous core microbial communities are key control strategies to ensuring the delivery of safe drinking water via the current ageing DWDS infrastructure. (C) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB The survival of aquatic biota in stream ecosystems depends on both water quantity and quality, and is particularly susceptible to degraded water quality in regulated rivers. Maintenance of environmental flows (e-flows) for aquatic biota with optimum water quantity and quality is essential for sustainable ecosystem services, especially in developing regions with insufficient stream monitoring of hydrology, water quality and aquatic biota. Few e-flow methods are available that closely link aquatic biota tolerances to pollutant concentrations in a simple and practical manner. In this paper a new method was proposed to assess e-flows that aimed to satisfy the requirements of aquatic biota for both the quantity and quality of the streamflow by linking fish tolerances to water quality criteria, or the allowable concentration of pollutants. For better operation of water projects and control of pollutants discharged into streams, this paper presented two coefficients for streamflow adjustment and pollutant control. Assessment of e-flows in the Wei River, the largest tributary of the Yellow River, shows that streamflow in dry seasons failed to meet e-flow requirements. Pollutant influx exerted a large pressure on the aquatic ecosystem, with pollutant concentrations much higher than that of the fish tolerance thresholds. We found that both flow velocity and water temperature exerted great influences on the pollutant degradation rate. Flow velocity had a much greater influence on pollutant degradation than did the standard deviation of flow velocity. This study provides new methods to closely link the tolerance of aquatic biota to water quality criteria for e-flow assessment. The recommended coefficients for streamflow adjustment and pollutant control, to dynamically regulate streamflow and control pollutant discharge, are helpful for river management and ecosystems rehabilitation. The relatively low data requirement also makes the method easy to use efficiently in developing regions, and thus this study has significant implications for managing flows in polluted and regulated rivers worldwide.

AB UV based advanced oxidation processes (UV-AOPs) that efficiently eliminate organic pollutants during water treatment have been the subject of numerous investigations. Most organic pollutants are not completely mineralized during UV-AOPs but are partially oxidized into transformation products (TPs), thereby adding complexity to the treated water and posing risks to humans, ecological systems, and the environment. While the degradation kinetics and mechanisms of pollutants have been widely documented, there is little information about the risks associated with TPs. In this review, we have collated recent knowledge about the harmful TPs that are generated in UV/H2O2 and UV photocatalysis, two UV-AOPs that have been studied extensively. Toxic and assimilable TPs were ubiquitously observed in more than 80% of UV-AOPs of organic pollutants, of which the toxicity and assimilability levels changed with variations in the reaction conditions, such as the UV fluence and oxidant dosage. Previous studies and modeling assessments showed that toxic and assimilable TPs may be generated during hydroxylation, dealkylation, decarboxylation, and deamination. Among various reactions, TPs generated from dealkylation and decarboxylation were generally less and more toxic than the parent pollutants, respectively; TPs generated from decarboxylation and deamination were generally less and more assimilable than the parent pollutants, respectively. There is also potential concern about the sensory-unpleasant TPs generated by oxidations and subsequent metabolism of microorganisms. In this overview, we stress the need to include both the concentrations of organic pollutants and the evaluations of the risks from TPs for the quality assessments of the water treated by UV-AOPs.

AB The amoeba Naegleria fowleri is the causative agent of the highly fatal disease, primary amoebic meningoencephalitis, and estimated to cause 16 deaths per year in the United States alone. Colonisation of drinking water distribution systems (DWDSs) by the N. fowleri is a significant public health issue. Understanding the factors which enable this pathogen to colonise and thrive in DWDSs is critical for proper management. The microbial ecology within DWDSs may influence the ability of N. fowleri to colonise DWDSs by facilitating the availability of an appropriate food source. Using biofilm samples obtained from operational DWDSs, 16S rRNA amplicon metabarcoding was combined with genus-specific PCR and Sanger sequencing of intracellular associated bacteria from isolated amoeba and their parental biofilms to identify Meiothermus chliarophilus as a potential food source for N. fowleri. Meiothermus was confirmed as a food source for N. fowleri following successful serial culturing of axenic N. fowleri with M. chliarophilus or M. tuber as the sole food source. The ability to identify environmental and ecological conditions favourable to N. fowleri colonisation, including the detection of appropriate food sources such as Meiothermus, could provide water utilities with a predictive tool for managing N. fowleri colonisation within the DWDS.

AB The long term performance of an anoxic-oxic-hydrocyclone (AOH) process with an in-situ hydro cyclone treatment unit in the mixed liquid return line for sludge reduction and carbon reuse has been observed, in comparison with a conventional anoxic-oxic (AO) process. Three parallel side-stream systems, including one AOH(25) system with a 25-mm hydrocyclone, one AOH(35) system with a 35-mm hydrocyclone and one AO system, were built and fed with real wastewater for a comparative study in a wastewater treatment plant. The results demonstrate that the hydrocyclone in the AOH process was able to break macro-flocs into smaller flocs. And the desorption of the extracellular polymeric substance from return activated sludge (AS) leaded to an average increase of 62.97% and 36.36% in SCOD in the AOH(25) and AOH(35) system, respectively. In addition, shear forces, centrifugal forces of revolution and flocs' rotation in the hydrocyclone were proposed to be the main influence mechanism of hydrocyclone treatment on AS properties. Compared with the AO process, the SCOD concentration in the effluent of the AOH processes presented a decrease of 12.0 mg/L and the TN was reduced by 21.50% owing to the released carbon sources reuse. Moreover, the sludge production was reduced by 36.81% and 35.92% in the AOH(25) and AOH(35) process, respectively. By contrast, the AOH(25) system was better than the AOH(35) system.

AB In recent years, there has been a widespread deployment of submersible fluorescence sensors by water utilities. They are used to measure diagnostic pigments and estimate algae and cyanobacteria abundance in near real-time. Despite being useful and promising tools, operators and decision-makers often rely on the data provided by these probes without a full understanding of their limitations. As a result, this may lead to wrong and misleading estimations which, in turn, means that researchers and technicians distrust these sensors. In this review paper, we list and discuss the main limitations of such probes, as well as identifying the effect of environmental factors on pigment production, and in turn, the conversion to cyanobacteria abundance estimation. We argue that a comprehensive calibration approach to obtain reliable readings goes well beyond manufacturers' recommendations, and should involve several context-specific experiments. We also believe that if such a comprehensive set of experiments is conducted, the data collected from fluorescence sensors could be used in artificial intelligence modelling approaches to reliably predict, in near real-time, the presence and abundance of different cyanobacteria species. This would have significant benefits for both drinking and recreational water management, given that cyanobacterial toxicity, and taste and odour compounds production, are species-dependent.

AB Industrial wastewaters are becoming increasingly associated with extreme conditions such as the presence of refractory compounds and high salinity that adversely affect biomass retention or reduce biological activity. Hence, this study evaluated the impact of long-term salinity increase to 20 gNa(+).L-1 on the bioconversion performance and microbial community composition in anaerobic membrane bioreactors treating phenolic wastewater. Phenol removal efficiency of up to 99.9% was achieved at 14 gNa(+).L-1. Phenol conversion rates of 5.1 mgPh.gVSS(-1).d(-1), 4.7 mgPh.gVSS(-1).d(-1), and 11.7 mgPh.gVSS(-1).d(-1) were obtained at 16 gNa(+).L-1,18 gNa(+1).L-1 and 20 gNa(+).L-1, respectively. The AnMBR's performance was not affected by short-term step-wise salinity fluctuations of 2 gNa(+).L-1 in the last phase of the experiment. It was also demonstrated in batch tests that the COD removal and methane production rate were higher at a K+:Na+ ratio of 0.05, indicating the importance of potassium to maintain the methanogenic activity. The salinity increase adversely affected the transmembrane pressure likely due to a particle size decrease from 185 mu m at 14 gNa(+).L-1 to 16 mu m at 20 gNa(+).L-1. Microbial community was dominated by bacteria belonging to the Clostridium genus and archaea by Methanobacterium and Methanosaeta genus. Syntrophic phenol degraders, such as Pelotomaculum genus were found to be increased when the maximum phenol conversion rate was attained at 20 gNa(+).L-1. Overall, the observed robustness of the AnMBR performance indicated an endured microbial community to salinity changes in the range of the sodium concentrations applied. (C) 2018 The Authors.

AB Nitrogen dynamics and its association to metabolically active microbial populations were assessed in two vertical subsurface vertical flow (VF) wetlands treating urban wastewater. These VF wetlands were operated in parallel with unsaturated (UVF) and partially saturated (SVF) configurations. The SVF wetland exhibited almost 2-fold higher total nitrogen removal rate (5g TN m(-2) d(-1)) in relation to the UVF wetland (3g TN m(-2) d(-1)), as well as a low NOx-N accumulation (1mg L-1 vs. 26 mg L-1 in SVF and UVF wetland effluents, respectively). After 6 months of operation, ammonia oxidizing prokaryotes (AOP) and nitrite oxidizing bacteria (NOB) displayed an important role in both wetlands. Oxygen availability and ammonia limiting conditions promoted shifts on the metabolically active nitrifying community within 'nitrification aggregates' of wetland biofllms. Ammonia oxidizing archaea (AOA) and Nitrospira spp. overcame ammonia oxidizing bacteria (AOB) in the oxic layers of both wetlands. Microbial quantitative and diversity assessments revealed a positive correlation between Nitrobacter and AOA, whereas Nitrospira resulted negatively correlated with Nitrobacter and AOB populations. The denitrifying gene expression was enhanced mainly in the bottom layer of the SVF wetland, in concomitance with the depletion of NOx-N from wastewater. Functional gene expression of nitrifying and denitrifying populations combined with the active microbiome diversity brought new insights on the microbial nitrogen cycling occurring within VF wetland biofllms under different operational conditions.

TI Impacts of groundwater management on energy resources and greenhouse gas

ID WATER; CARBON; US
AB California faces significant energy and water infrastructure planning challenges in response to a changing climate. Immediately following the most severe recorded drought, the state experienced one of its wettest water years in recorded history. Despite the recent severe wet weather, much of the state's critical groundwater systems have not recovered from the drought. The recent Sustainable Groundwater Management Act (SGMA) aims to eliminate future depletion risks, but may force California basins to seek alternative water sources by limiting groundwater withdrawals during droughts. These alternative water resources, such as recycled water or desalination, can have significantly higher energy demands in treatment and supply than local groundwater or surface water resources.
   This research developed potential scenarios of water supply sources for five overdrafted groundwater basins, and modeled the impacts of these scenarios on energy demands and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions for water supply systems. Our results reveal that energy demands and GHG emissions in different water supply scenarios can vary substantially between basins, but could increase statewide energy consumption as much as 2% and GHG emissions by 0.5. These results highlight the need to integrate these energy and GHG impacts into water resource management. Better understanding these considerations enables water supply planners to avoid potential unintended consequences (i.e., increased energy demands and GHG emissions) of enhancing drought resilience.

AB Rapid industrialization and urbanization pose pressure on water resources in China. Virtual water trade proves to be an increasingly useful tool in water stress alleviation for water-scarce regions, while bringing opportunities and challenges for less developed water-rich regions. In this study, Yunnan, a typical province in southwest China, was selected as the case study area to explore its potential in socioeconomic development in the context of water sustainability. Both input-output analysis and structural decomposition analysis on Yunnan's water footprint for the period of 2002-2012 were performed at not only an aggregated level but also a sectoral level. Results show that although the virtual water content of all economic sectors decreased due to technological progress, Yunnan's total water footprint still increased as a result of economic scale expansion. From the sectoral perspective, sectors with large water footprints include construction sector, agriculture sector, food manufacturing & processing sector, and service sector, while metal products sector and food manufacturing & processing sector were the major virtual water exporters, and textile & clothing sector and construction sector were the major importers. Based on local conditions, policy suggestions were proposed, including economic structure and efficiency optimization, technology promotion and appropriate virtual water trade scheme. This study provides valuable insights for regions facing "resource curse" by exploring potential socio-economic progress while ensuring water security. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB For the first time, the natural formation of silver-based nanoparticles (Ag-b-NPs) was studied in field investigations of two pre-alpine lakes in Germany that contain geogenic silver traces in the sub-ng L-1 range. Light-sensitive microorganisms most likely accumulate and transport these silver traces from deeper water layers to the surface. At the surface of the eutrophic lake, approximately 40% of total silver (5.7 ng L-1) consisted of Ag-b-NPs, whereas in the oligotrophic lake with similar enrichment of silver species, no Ag-b-NPs were detected. Additional lab experiments with nature-related Ag(I) concentrations in the lower-ng L-1 range and natural organic matter with total organic carbon values of <= 5 mg L-1 revealed that, contrary to common interpretation in the literature, Ag-b-NPs are also or even preferably formed in the dark. Particle size increases gradually with increasing reaction time, showing that Ostwald ripening occurs even at such low particle concentrations. When sulfide ions are present, smaller Ag-b-NPs with a narrower size distribution are formed. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Comprehensively understanding the fate and transport of perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) in subsurface environment is crucial to assess its environmental impacts. In this work, column experiments were conducted to investigate the effects of physicochemical factors on the retention and transport of C-14-labeled PFOA in saturated sand and limestone porous media. The retention of PFOA in limestone columns was higher than that in sand columns under the same solution chemistry conditions. This can be attributed to that the limestone had less negative zeta-potential and larger specific surface area than the sand. Changes in ionic strength (low to high) and cation type (Na+ to Ca2+) had little influences on the mobility of PFOA in sand porous media, but significantly enhanced the retention of PFOA in limestone porous media. Nearly no PFOA was retained in the sand columns, but relatively high levels of PFOA retention (28.7-48.4%) were achieved in the limestone columns. Higher input concentration resulted in lower PFOA retention in limestone porous media, reflecting the blocking effect of the sorption sites. The blocking effect was insignificant in sand porous media, probably because the experimental conditions were unfavorable for PFOA sorption on sand media. A two-site kinetic retention model effectively simulated both the breakthrough and retention behaviors of the PFOA in the sand and limestone porous media. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Ultraviolet (UV) light emission diode (LED), which is mercury free and theoretically more energy efficient, has now become an alternative to conventional UV lamps in water disinfection industry. In this research, the disinfection performance of a novel sequential process, UVA(365nm) LED followed by UVC265nm LED (UVA-UVC), was evaluated. The results revealed that the responses of different bacterial strains to UVA-UVC varied. Coupled with appropriate dosages of UVC, a 20 min UVA pre-radiation provided higher inactivations (log inactivation) of E. coli ATCC 11229, 15597 and 700891 by 1.2, 1.4 and 1.2 times, respectively than the sum of inactivations by UVA alone and UVC alone. On the contrary, the inactivation of E. coli ATCC 25922, the most UVC sensitive strain, decreased from 3 log to 1.8 log after UVA pre-radiation. A 30 min UVA pre-radiation did not affect the photo repair capacity of the four strains (n = 23, p > 0.1), but their dark repair ability was significantly inhibited (n = 14, p < 0.05). Mechanism study was conducted for two representative strains, E. soli ATCC 15597 and 25922 to understand the observed effect. The hypothesis that UVA pre-radiation promoted the yield of reactive oxygen species (ROS) was rejected. ELISA results indicated that 18% more cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPD) were formed in E. coil ATCC 15597 with UVA pre-radiation (n = 3, p < 0.01), however, the CPD levels of E. soli ATCC 25922 was the same with or without UVA pre-radiation (n = 3, p > 0.01). Considering the results of both dark repair and CPD formation, it was concluded that the increased UV sensitivity of E. coli 15597 was originated from the increased CPD. For E. coli ATCC 25922, the enhanced UV resistance was attributed to the strain's adoption of a survival strategy, translesion DNA synthesis (TLS), when triggered by UVA pre-radiation. The study on UmuD protein, which is a key protein during TB, confirmed this hypothesis. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Up to now, only a few studies about microparticle contamination of bottled mineral water have been published. The smallest analysed particle size was 5 gm. However, due to toxicological reasons, especially microparticles smaller than 1.5 mu m are critically discussed. Therefore, in the present study, 32 samples of bottled mineral water were investigated for contamination by microplastics, pigment and additive particles. Due to the application of aluminium coated polycarbonate membrane filters and micro-Raman spectroscopy, a lowest analysed particle size of 1 mu m was achieved.
   Microplastics were found in water from all bottle types: in single use and reusable bottles made of poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) as well as in glass bottles. The amount of microplastics in mineral water varied from 2649 +/- 2857 per litre in single use PET bottles up to 6292 +/- 10521 per litre in glass bottles. While in plastic bottles, the predominant polymer type was PET; in glass bottles various polymers such as polyethylene or styrene-butadiene-copolymer were found. Hence, besides the packaging itself, other contamination sources have to be considered.
   Pigment particles were detected in high amounts in reusable, paper labelled bottles (195047 +/- 330810 pigment particles per litre in glass and 23594 +/- 25518 pigment particles per litre in reusable paper labelled PET bottles). Pigment types found in water samples were the same as used for label printing, indicating the bottle cleaning process as possible contamination route.
   Furthermore, on average 708 +/- 1024 particles per litre of the additive Tris(2,4-di-tert-butylphenyl) phosphite were found in reusable PET bottles. This additive might be leached out from the bottle material itself.
   Over 90% of the detected microplastics and pigment particles were smaller than 5 mu m and thus not covered by previous studies. In summary, this is the first study reporting about microplastics, pigment and additive particles found in bottled mineral water samples with a smallest analysed particle size of 1 mu m.

AB This article examines the potential benefits of using Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) for conducting energy-efficiency assessment of wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). WWTPs are characteristically heterogeneous (in size, technology, climate, function ...) which limits the correct application of DEA. This paper proposes and describes the Robust Energy Efficiency DEA (REED) in its various stages, a systematic state-of-the-art methodology aimed at including exogenous variables in nonparametric frontier models and especially designed for WWTP operation. In particular, the methodology systematizes the modelling process by presenting an integrated framework for selecting the correct variables and appropriate models, possibly tackling the effect of exogenous factors. As a result, the application of REED improves the quality of the efficiency estimates and hence the significance of benchmarking. For the reader's convenience, this article is presented as a step-by-step guideline to guide the user in the determination of WWTPs energy efficiency from beginning to end. The application and benefits of the developed methodology are demonstrated by a case study related to the comparison of the energy efficiency of a set of 399 WWTPs operating in different countries and under heterogeneous environmental conditions.

AB In north-west Europe, agricultural diffuse P losses are a major cause of eutrophication problems in surface waters. Given that the Water Framework Directive (WFD) demands fast water quality improvements and most of the actual P mitigation strategies tend to work on the long run, new short-term mitigation measures are urgently needed. We here report on the entire process of developing small scale field filters to remove P at the end of tile drains, starting from the screening of potential P sorbing materials (PSM): iron coated sand (ICS), acid pre-treated natural minerals (biotite, glauconite and olivine) and bauxite. Initial batch (ad)sorption experiments revealed following order in both, P sorption capacity and speed: ICS > bauxite > glauconite > olivine = biotite. Because of the presence of significant amounts of lead and/or nickel, we excluded bauxite and olivine from further experiments. Subsequent lab scale flow through systems were conducted with P filters containing mixtures of ICS and glauconite (100/0, 90/10, 80/20, 70/30 and 60/40%, respectively, on weight basis). We found a significant relationship between K-sat and the filter mixtures particle size distribution and bulk density, and a significant effect of the filter mixture composition on P removal efficiency and stability of Ksat. During the 10 week field trials, the pure ICS filters were capable of processing all drainage discharge rates (up to 6 m(3) day(-1)) with a P removal efficiency of >= 74%. The 90/10 ICS/glauconite filters could process up to 4 m(3) water day(-1) with a P removal efficiency of 57%. As saturated ICS filters can easily be replaced and recycled for other applications, this is a promising sustainable technique to drastically cut back diffuse P losses and to tremendously improve surface water quality in the short term.

AB Arsenic compounds are carcinogenic to humans and are typically removed from contaminated water using various sorbents. The ionic composition plays a significant role in arsenate removal efficiency during the process of water remediation. Here, we quantify the effects of natural ions (chlorides, nitrates, carbonates, sulfates, and phosphates) and humic acid on the removal of arsenates by ferrate(VI) at pH = 6.6. In the experiments, the initial concentration of arsenates was 10 mg L-1 (as As) and the concentrations of ions varied in the range from 5 to 100 mg L-1 of element in ionic form and humic acid. The achieved results show that only phosphate ions had principle influence on the efficiency of arsenate removal by ferrate(VI). The effect of phosphates was elucidated by applying transmission electron microscopy, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, and low temperature in-field Fe-57 Mossbauer spectroscopy to solid samples, prepared under different weight ratios of ferrate(VI), arsenates, and phosphates. These results show three crucial effects of phosphates on the arsenate removal mechanisms. At low P:As weight ratio (up to 1:1), the incorporation of arsenate ions into the crystalline structure of gamma-Fe2O3/gamma-FeOOH nanoparticles was found to be suppressed by the presence of phosphates. Thus, arsenates were mainly adsorbed onto the surface of gamma-Fe2O3/gamma-FeOOH nanoparticles. Further increase in the P:As weight ratio (more than 1:1) resulted in the competition between arsenates and phosphates sorption. With the increased concentration of phosphate ions, the number of arsenates on the surface of gamma-Fe2O3/gamma-FeOOH nanoparticles was reduced. Finally, the complexation of iron(III) ions with phosphate ions occurred, leading to a decrease in the arsenates removal efficiency, which resulted from a lower content of precipitated gamma-Fe2O3/gamma-FeOOH nanoparticles. All these aspects need to be considered prior to application of ferrate(VI) for arsenates removal in real natural waters. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The impact of the starting inoculum on long-term anaerobic digestion performance, process functionality and microbial community composition remains unclear. To understand the impact of starting inoculum, active microbial communities from four different full-scale anaerobic digesters were each used to inoculate four continuous lab-scale anaerobic digesters, which were operated identically for 295 days. Digesters were operated at 15 days solid retention time, an organic loading rate of 1 g COD L-r(-1) d(-1) (75:25 - cellulose:casein) and 37 degrees C. Results showed that long-term process performance, metabolic rates (hydrolytic, acetogenic, and methanogenic) and microbial community are independent of the inoculum source. Digesters process performance converged after 80 days, while metabolic rates and microbial communities converged after 120-145 days. The convergence of the different microbial communities towards a core-community proves that the deterministic factors (process operational conditions) were a stronger driver than the initial microbial community composition. Indeed, the core-community represented 72% of the relative abundance among the four digesters. Moreover, a number of positive correlations were observed between higher metabolic rates and the relative abundance of specific microbial groups. These correlations showed that both substrate consumers and suppliers trigger higher metabolic rates, expanding the knowledge of the nexus between microorganisms and functionality. Overall, these results support that deterministic factors control microbial communities in bioreactors independently of the inoculum source. Hence, it seems plausible that a desired microbial composition and functionality can be achieved by tuning process operational conditions. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB This paper uses chemical and physical data from a large 2017 U.S. Geological Survey groundwater dataset with wells in the U.S. and three smaller international groundwater datasets with wells primarily in Australia and Spain to carry out a comprehensive investigation of brackish groundwater composition in relation to minimum desalination energy costs. First, we compute the site-specific least work required for groundwater desalination. Least work of separation represents a baseline for specific energy consumption of desalination systems. We develop simplified equations based on the U.S. data for least work as a function of water recovery ratio and a proxy variable for composition, either total dissolved solids, specific conductance, molality or ionic strength. We show that the U.S. correlations for total dissolved solids and molality may be applied to the international datasets. We find that total molality can be used to calculate the least work of dilute solutions with very high accuracy. Then, we examine the effects of groundwater solute composition on minimum energy requirements, showing that separation requirements increase from calcium to sodium for cations and from sulfate to bicarbonate to chloride for anions, for any given TDS concentration. We study the geographic distribution of least work, total dissolved solids, and major ions concentration across the U.S. We determine areas with both low least work and high water stress in order to highlight regions holding potential for desalination to decrease the disparity between high water demand and low water supply. Finally, we discuss the implications of the USGS results on water resource planning, by comparing least work to the specific energy consumption of brackish water reverse osmosis plants and showing the scaling propensity of major electrolytes and silica in the U.S. groundwater samples.

AB A tiered process was developed to assess the transformation, CO2 formation and uptake of four organic micropollutants by carrier-attached microorganisms from two municipal wastewater treatment plants. At the first tier, primary transformation of ibuprofen, naproxen, diclofenac, and mecoprop by carrier attached microorganisms was shown by the dissipation of the target compounds and the formation of five transformation products using LC-tandem MS. At the second tier, the microbial cleavage of the four organic micropollutants was confirmed with C-14-labeled micropollutants through liquid scintillation counting of the (CO2)-C-14 formed. At the third tier, microautoradiography coupled with fluorescence in situ hybridization (MAR-FISH) was used to screen carrier-attached microorganisms for uptake of the four radiolabeled micropollutants. Results from the MAR-FISH screening indicated that only a small fraction of the microbial community (<= 1 parts per thousand) was involved in the uptake of the radiolabeled micropollutants and that the responsible microorganisms differed between the compounds. At the fourth tier, the microbial community structure of the carrier-attached biofilms was analyzed by 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. The sequencing results showed that the MAR-FISH screening targeted similar to 80% of the microbial community and that several taxonomic families within the FISH-probed populations with MAR-positive signals (i.e. Firmicutes, Gammaproteobacteria, and Deltaproteobacteria) were present in both biofilms. From the broader perspective of organic micropollutant removal in biological wastewater treatment, the MAR-FISH results of this study indicate a high degree of microbial substrate specialization that could explain differences in transformation rates and patterns between micropollutants and microbial communities.

AB Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) techniques were used to study the effect of four food additives, agar, alginate, lecithin and glycerol, at three different concentrations, 0.5, 1 and 1.5%, on the molecular structure of potato puree prepared from commercial potato powder. Vibrational spectra revealed that the amylose-amylopectin skeleton present in the raw potato starch was missing in the potato powder but could be fully recovered upon water addition when the potato puree was prepared. FTIR peaks corresponding to water were clearly present in the potato powder, indicating the important structural role of water molecules in the recovery of the initial molecular conformation.
   None of the studied puree samples presented a crystalline structure or strong internal order. A comparison of the FTIR and XRD results revealed that the additives exerted some effects, mainly on the long-range order of the starch structure via interacting with and changing -OH and hydrogen bond interactions.

AB Rapid, direct, on-site and noninvasive food analysis is strongly needed for quality control of food. To satisfy this demand, the technique of dipping probe electrospray ionization/mass spectrometry (dPESI/MS) was developed. The sample surface was pricked with a fine acupuncture needle and a sample of similar to 200 pL was captured at the needle tip. After drying the sample, the needle tip was dipped into the solvent for similar to 50 ms and was moved upward. A high-voltage was applied to the needle to generate electrospray when the needle reached the highest position, and mass spectra were measured with a time-of-flight mass spectrometer. For evaluation of the method, the technique was used to analyze foods such as vegetables, salmon flesh, cow's milk, yogurt, and soy-bean milk. The detected major ions for cow's milk and yogurt were [(Lac)(n) + Ca](2+) with n = 1-6 (where (Lac) is lactose), indicating that Ca2+ is tightly bound by Lac molecules.

AB An efficient method was developed and validated for simultaneous determination of tebuconazole, thiophanate-methyl and its metabolite carbendazim in grape and soil using QuEChERS procedure and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. The average recoveries of the method were 83.2%-105.4%, the limit of detection (LOD) ranged from 2.1 x 10(-5) to 8.7 x 10(-4) mg L-1, and the limit of quantitation (LOQ) was 0.1 mg kg(-1). The field results showed that tebuconazole and thiophanate-methyl in soil and grape were rapidly dissipated with half-lives less than 24.7 days. The terminal residues of all analytes in grape were lower than the maximum residue limit (MRL) set by China (2 mg kg(-1) for tebuconazole; 3 mg kg(-1) for both thiophanate-methyl and carbendazim). Risk assessment showed that tebuconazole, thiophanate-methyl and its metabolite would be unlikely to cause health problems. However, carbendazim, the higher active metabolites of thiophanate-methyl, should receive more concerns.

AB Esterified astaxanthins are used as functional nutraceuticals in many food products. Unfortunately, their utilization is currently limited owing to their poor water solubility, chemical instability, and low bioavailability. In this study, esterified astaxanthin microcapsules were fabricated through electrostatic complexation of whey protein and gum arabic by adjusting the pH to 4.0. After their encapsulation, the stability of the esterified astaxanthins was effectively better than that of the oleoresin. In vitro tests revealed a 26% rate of astaxanthin release from the microcapsules, which was significantly higher than the 14.6% rate from the oleoresin (P < 0.05). In vivo experiments showed that the AUC(0-t) value after oral gavage of the microcapsules (8.23 +/- 1.33 h.mu g.mL(-1)) was approximately 2-fold higher than that after gavage of the oleoresin (3.72 +/- 0.98 h.mu g.mL(-1)). In conclusion, the bioavailability of esterified astaxanthins can be significantly improved by microencapsulation.

AB Although a series of physio-biochemical changes of coix seed occur during the storage, the underlying mechanism remains unknown. The present study aimed to investigate the aging mechanism of coix seed during storage. Proteome patterns of coix seed stored for 1-month, 5-month and 10-month at room temperature were compared using 2-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE) and mass spectra. Thirty-one differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) were detected, which involved seven pathways including starch and sucrose metabolism, carbon metabolism, RNA transport, proteasome, protein processing in endoplasmic reticulum, ribosome, and RNA degradation. Sucrose synthase 1 was associated with sucrose metabolism and affected the sucrose content during the storage. Increased ambient temperature enhanced respiration of coix after 5-month storage, and overexpression of aconitate hydratase 2 promoted the generation of energy. In addition, the proteins involved in the antioxidant system and resistance stimulus of coix seed were mostly up-regulated during storage.

AB Fried battered foods are widely consumed worldwide. In this study, the influence of the replacement of native wheat flour by extruded flours (7.5 and 15%) subjected to different extrusion severities on chicken nuggets was assessed. Microstructure, pick-up, moisture and fat content, texture, colour, volatile profile, and consumer acceptability were evaluated. Extruded flour replacement resulted in batters with improved pick-up with increasing percentage and severity of extrusion treatment. Extruded flour also contributed to a moisture increase, while oil remained practically unchanged. Textural properties highlighted a higher crispness of batters made with high-severity treatment extruded flours. Volatile compounds analyses revealed lower amount of lipid oxidation (lower rancidity notes) and higher furfuryl alcohol content (pleasant aroma and darker crust) in fried batters containing extruded flour. Consumers testing showed that batters made with intermediate-severity treatment extruded flour presented the best acceptability. These results confirm that extruded flour inclusion improves the quality of deep-fried batters.

The C20-22 polyunsaturated fatty acid (C20-22 PUFA) concentrate (CFA) prepared from the deep-sea dogfish liver oil was added with the studied compounds and physiochemical properties and fatty acid composition during an accelerated storage were evaluated. No significant reduction in C20-22 PUFAs (similar to 6%) in the CFA treated with 1 as compared to that with the control (similar to 35%) was recorded. A greater induction time was observed for the CFA supplemented with 1 (6.8 h) than other compounds (<= 6 h) and control (similar to 1.6 h), maintaining the oxidation indices of the CFA within desirable limits.

AB Pomace of Hamburg Muscat was dried at temperature of drying air 45 degrees C and different air velocity (1.5, 2.0 and 2.5 m/s) in open-loop heat pump (HP) and laboratory-type closed-loop dryer (as a control). In the HP dryer, it was concluded that drying air velocity was slightly effective on drying time however there is no significant effect on the power consumption of the change in the drying air velocity at the same temperature. When comparing the energy consumption of the HP dryer and convective dryer, the energy consumption was reduced by up to 51%. In HP drying, the increase of air velocity from 1.5 m/s to 2.5 m/s caused a reduction in drying time by 69%. It was observed that part of the bioactive properties was lost in pomace samples but there were fewer losses in all bioactive properties than the others except the total anthocyanin at 2 m/s.

AB Phenoloxidases (POs) play a crucial role in melanization of crustaceans. There are at least two types of POs characterized in crustaceans: the conventional type (PO alpha here) that is expressed in hemocytes and PO beta, a secreted protein synthesized in the hepatopancreas. We investigated the source of PO activity in the hemolymph of a lobster and determined the kinetic parameters of mono- and di-PO activities. In the lobster hemolymph, PO alpha, which formed a hexamer similar to both PO beta and hemocyanin, contributed to PO activity, whereas the amount of PO beta was low. Kinetic analyses using purified prophenoloxidase of crustaceans showed that lobster PO alpha has a higher rate constant, while shrimp PO beta has higher specificity in both mono- and di-PO reactions, when tyramine and dopamine were employed as substrates. There should be at least two types of PO molecules in crustacean hemolymph, but the dominant PO molecule type varies among species.

AB Quaternary ammonium compounds containing N-trimethylamino moiety, such as choline derivatives and carnitine, abundant in meat and dairy products, are metabolic precursors of trimethylamine (TMA). A similar fate is reported for N-epsilon-trimethyllysine and gamma-butyrobetaine. With the aim at investigating the metabolic profile of such metabolites in most employed animal dietary sources, HPLC-ESI-MS/MS analyses on ruminant and non-ruminant milk and meat were performed. Results demonstrate, for the first time, the presence of delta-valerobetaine, occurring at levels higher than gamma-butyrobetaine in all ruminant samples compared to non-ruminants. Demonstration of delta-valerobetaine metabolic origin, surprisingly, showed that it originates from rumen through the transformation of dietary N-epsilon.-trimethyllysine. These results highlight our previous findings showing the ubiquity of free N-epsilon-trimethyllysine in vegetable kingdom. Furthermore, delta-valerobetaine, similarly to gamma-butyrobetaine, can be degraded by host gut microbiota producing TMA, precursor of the proatherogenic trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO), unveiling its possible role in the biosynthetic route of TMAO.

AB New functional oils (extra virgin olive oil, EVOO and sunflower oil, SO) containing antioxidants from Hibiscus sabdariffa extract were developed by W/O emulsion. Their physical and chemical stability was measured over time. The lowest coalescence rate was obtained with 8 and 12 wt% surfactant amount for EVOO and SO emulsions, respectively. Before the evaluation of the oxidative stability, an optimization of phenolic compounds extraction from emulsions by multi-response surface methodology was performed. EVOO emulsions were chemically more stable over time than SO emulsions in terms of total phenolic content (TPC), antioxidant activity and chemical composition measured by HPLC-ESI. TOF-MS. TPC significantly increased (from 2.02 +/- 0.07 to 2.71 +/- 0.06 mg Eq GAE/g extract) and the antioxidant activity measured by TEAC remained constant for 1 month of storage. Thus, W/O emulsion technology has proven to be a potential method to vehiculize and stabilize bioactive compounds from H. sabdariffa into edible oils.

AB Accurate quantification of folpet is problematic because it degrades into phthalimide during sample preparation and analysis by gas chromatography (GC). Thus, EU regulation was recently modified to include phthalimide in the folpet residue definition. However, recent studies have shown that phthalimide could also be generated from different sources, which could lead to an overestimation of the phthalimide content and therefore to false positives. GC coupled with either negative chemical ionisation and single quadrupole mass spectrometry, or electron ionisation with triple quadrupole mass spectrometry (GC-EI-MS/MS), were evaluated for the determination of folpet and phthalimide in food. Both methods were validated in 4 different matrices namely apple puree, rice flour, raspberry puree and infant formula. Better selectivity and precision were obtained with GC-EI-MS/MS. Negligible amounts of phthalimide was found in blank matrices, and validation results met the SANTE/11813/2017 criteria in all matrices at the LOQ concentration levels by using GC-EI-MS/MS.

AB The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of chlorogenic acid (CGA) treatment on induction of resistance against pathogens in peach fruit. Treatment with CGA at 25-150 mg L-1 was effective at reducing lesion diameter and decay index of peach fruit during storage at 25 degrees C after Penicillium expansum infection. CGA treatment had also significant beneficial effects on fruit quality parameters including firmness, soluble solids contents, pH value, and titratable acidity. Activities of main defense-related enzymes and expression of key genes involved in the salicylic acid (SA) signaling pathway, such as PAL, ICS, WRKY, NPR1, PR1, CHI, GLU, PR5, and POD, were enhanced by CGA treatment. These findings suggest that CGA treatment is a promising approach to controlling postharvest blue mold rot in peach fruit, and activation of the SA signaling pathway may play a potential role in mechanisms involving CGA-induced plant disease resistance.

AB The majority of L-cysteine is obtained industrially by hydrolysis of animal materials, such as poultry feathers. Despite widespread belief, there is little evidence that human hair is used as a source material and its use is explicitly banned in the European Union (2000/63/EC decision). We developed an isotope ratio mass spectrometric (EA-IRMS) method to determine carbon and nitrogen isotopic ratio in cysteine preparations and related compounds, e.g. cystine and carbocysteine. A threshold relying on the N-15/N-14 was established to differentiate between hair and feathers; a value below 6.6% indicates a poultry feathers origin. Global uncertainty of measurement was found to be 0.1% for delta N-15 (sample size of 0.5-1.8 mg).

AB The aim of this study was to demonstrate the potential of extracts from Algerian Thymus munbyanus as a valuable source of antioxidants for use on an industrial level. To this end, a study was conducted on the composition and antioxidant activities of essential oils (EOs), pressurized liquid extracts (PLE) and supercritical fluid extracts (SFE-CO2) obtained from Thymus munbyanus subsp. coloratus (TMC) and subsp. munbyanus (TMM). EOs and SFE-CO2 extracts were analysed by GC-FID and GCxGC-TOFMS revealing significant differences. A successive extraction of the solid SFE-CO2 residue by PLE extraction with solvents of increasing polarity such as acetone, ethanol and water, was carried out. The extracts were evaluated for total phenolic content by Folin-Ciocalteu assay, while the antioxidant power was assessed by DPPH, FRAP, and ORAC assays. SFE-CO2 extracts were also analysed for their tocopherol content. The antioxidant activity of PLE extracts was found to be higher than that of SFE-CO2 extracts, and this increased with solvent polarity (water > ethanol > acetone). Overall, these results support the use of T. munbyanus as a valuable source of substances to be used on an industrial level as preservative agents.

AB 4-alkyl-branched-chain fatty acids (vBCFAs) are responsible for the goaty-sheepy flavour of sheep and goat milk. The levels of vBCFAs were investigated in sheep, goat and cow milk powders. The effect of season and industrial processes on the levels of vBCFAs in sheep milk was also evaluated. Sheep milk powders contained lower amounts of 4-Me-8:0 and 4-Et-8:0 (143-176 and 1.2-10.7 mu g/g milk fat) than goat milk powders (335-481 and 73.1-105 mu g/g milk fat), while 4-Me-9:0 was low in both sheep and goat milk powders (< 8 mu g/g milk fat). Odour activity values (OAVs) of sheep milk powders (17-393) were 6-fold lower than the values of goat milk powders (882-1323). Higher levels of vBCFAs were found in sheep milk produced in spring than in summer. Thermisation had little impact on vBCFAs; however, spray drying led to dramatic increases in free vBCFAs, particularly towards late lactation, which resulted in higher OAVs in sheep milk powder compared to raw milk.

AB Biological and biochemical fingerprints were investigated for the first time for the feasibility of effect-directed classification, and thus, to allow the choice of a distinct beer with regard to beneficial health effects. A high-performance thin-layer chromatography method was newly developed and combined with in situ effect-directed analysis for profiling 50 German beers for multipotent active compounds, and thus, their health-related potential. Discovered multipotent active zones were online eluted and characterized by high resolution mass spectrometry. For example, isoxanthohumol, iso-alpha-ad/n-humulone or its isomers, desdimethyl-octahydro-isocohumulone and ad/n-humulone were proven as antimicrobial compounds, isoxanthohumol as an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, and isoxanthohumol and iso-alpha-ad/n-humulone or its isomers as radical scavengers. Investigating multivariate data analysis of effect-directed fingerprints for the first time, the pattern recognition and classification results showed the power of clustering non-alcoholic beers from other types of beer, or it showed the differentiation of dark and non-alcoholic beers.

AB In this paper, we present for the first time a new tool, based on Droplet Digital (TM) Polymerase Chain Reaction (ddPCR), for absolute quantification of key genera of gastrointestinal (GI) nematode parasites of grazing livestock. Four combinations of primers/probe sets targeting the internal transcribed spacer region 2 (ITS2) of the ribosomal RNA gene array were designed using the Primer3 software, following in silico analysis of nucleotide sequences from nematodes of interest downloaded from common databases. The amplified regions include both a universal region for detection of any strongylid gastrointestinal parasite and three different genus specific regions, making it possible to differentiate between the most important GI nematodes of sheep in Sweden: Haemonchus, Teladorsagia and Trichostrongylus. Analysis of samples containing serial dilutions and different mixtures of genomic DNA extracted from different species of adult worms proved useful in assessment of different threshold settings with the QuantaSoft software. Analysis of template DNA from these worms indicated that ddPCR is a viable choice for detection and absolute quantification of the different genera and also in samples with multiple species. Interpretation of the ddPCR results was straightforward and choice of analytical approach had little influence on the final results. Thus, the results obtained in the different analytical approaches seemed to be robust and the concentrations determined were uniform. Furthermore, the linear range of the Haemonchus ddPCR assay was similar to that of real-time PCR (qPCR). Taken together, our data confirm the suitability of ddPCR for detection and absolute quantification of three major sheep pathogens when tested on larval cultures from pooled ovine faeces. The results also indicate that ddPCR can be a useful complement to applications based on conventional egg counting methods such as the faecal egg reduction test (FECRT).

AB Leishmania (L.) infantum-infected dogs may present with a large range of clinical signs, from apparently healthy with no or few (asymptomatic dogs, AD) to several clinical signs indicators of active infection (symptomatic dogs, SD). The present study is justified by the conflicting reports describing that either L. infantum-specific IgGI or IgG2 antibodies may be used as isotype marker of the asymptomatic infection status and by the lack, to our knowledge, of previous analysis of the IgG sub-classes autoantibody repertoires of Leishmania-infected dogs. On the basis of clinical evaluation and laboratory testing (IFAT, parasitological examination of Giemsa-stained lymph node smears, L. infantum antigens-ELISA of total (Tot) IgG), 131 dogs were categorized as SD, asymptomatic seronegative (AND) or seropositive dogs (APD) from surrounding areas, and as negative control dogs (CTD). ELISA based on leishmanial native antigens or recombinant LACK and LeIF proteins showed that SD produce higher levels of specific Tot IgG, IgGI and IgG2 antibodies than APD, and that for both clinical stages, the antibody titers of IgG2 isotype were constantly higher than those of the IgGI. The seroprevalences of Tot IgG, IgG2 did not differ between APD and SD groups (97 and 97% in SD; 100 and 96% in APD, respectively) whereas that of IgGI was slightly lower in SD (88% of APD versus 82% of SD). The autoantibody repertoires were analyzed by ELISA using HEp-2 extracts, ds-DNA, human albumin and transferrin as self-antigens and by Western blot using HEp-2 proteins. ELISA results' indicated that APD develop higher levels of IgGI auto antibodies, and higher seroprevalence (50% and 26% in APD and SD, respectively), contrasting with lower levels and seroprevalences of Tot IgG and IgG2 (43 and 68% for APD; 100 and 74% for SD). Interestingly, SD showed a stronger IgGI and particularly IgG2 reactivity with transferrin, an iron-binding protein, than APD and AND. Western blotting experiments produced heterogeneous IgGI and IgG2 inter- and intra-groups reactivity profiles towards HEp-2 proteins, to identify a specific antigenic profile. Generated data from competitive HEp-2-ELISA using leishmanial antigens as inhibitors were in favor that IgGI antibodies are predominantly autoantibodies to self-antigens in APD whereas they are mainly cross-reactive (Leishmania/self-antigens) in SD.

ID REPUBLIC-OF-CHINA; INFECTION
AB Schistosomiasis is a zoonotic parasitic disease threatening tens of millions people and farm animals. Water buffalos are a major reservoir for schistosomiasis and a control target. Epidemiological surveys suggest that buffalos can develop resistance against Schistosoma japonicum reinfection. In the present paper, relative to control animals, we report an over 97% worm burden reduction after two rounds of infection with S. japonicum and treatment with Praziquantel (PZQ). Relative to control animals, shorter length of female worms, and lower egg counts (over 87.7% reduction rates) were observed in reinfected buffalos. We also found that the reinfected buffalos had significantly higher levels of IL-4, IL-10, and IFN-gamma, 4-9 weeks after the secondary infection, and a significantly higher level of specific IgG antibodies before infection. Our results confirmed that after infection buffalos develop resistance against S. japonicum reinfection, and that this resistance is mainly due to acquired immunity. These findings may aid in the future vaccine design for water buffalos.

AB Internal parasites of horses comprise an intractable problem conferring disease, production and performance losses. Parasitism can rarely be controlled in grazing horses by management alone and anthelmintic drugs have formed the basis of therapy and prophylaxis for the last sixty years. The pharmacology of the anthelmintic drugs available dictate their spectrum of activity and degree of efficacy, their optimal routes of administration and characteristics which prevent some routes of administration, their safety tolerance and potential toxicities and as a consequence of their persistence in the body at effective concentrations their use in epidemiological control programmes. Their use has also resulted in the selection of parasites with genetically controlled characteristics which reduce their susceptibility to treatment, characteristics which are often common to whole chemical classes of anthelmintics.
   Pharmacological properties also confer compatibility in terms of safety and persistence with other anthelmintic drugs and thus the potential of combinations to treat parasites from different phylogenetic groups such as nematodes, cestodes and trematodes and also the potential by agency of their different molecular mechanisms of action to delay the selection of resistant genes. The major groups of anthelmintics now available, the benzimidazoles (BZD), macrocyclic lactones (MLs) and tetrahydropyrimidines are all highly effective against their targeted parasites (primarily nematodes for BZD's and ML's and cestodes for tetrahydropyrimidines) easily administered orally to horses and are well tolerated with wide margins of safety. Nevertheless, some parasitic stages are inherently less susceptible such as hypobiotic stages of the small strongyles (cyathostomins) and for some such as the adult stages of cyathostomins resistance has developed. Furthermore, for some less common parasites such as the liver fluke unlicensed drugs such as the salicylanilide, closantel have been used.
   A deep understanding of the pharmacology of anthelmintic drugs is essential to their optimal use in equine species.

AB The genetic diversity of Gasterophilus pecorum populations consisting of 192 individuals sampled from Przewalski's horses (Equus fetus przewalskii) in Xinjiang Province, China, was evaluated using 12 microsatellite loci. The genetic variability within populations and genetic differentiation among populations were estimated. A total of 163 alleles were detected and the average value of observed number of alleles at each locus ranged from 7 to 19 (average 13.5625). The expected heterozygosity (He) varied from 0.5933 (GP361) to 0.9208 (GP253) and averaged 0.8426. The effective number of alleles (Ne) of the simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers was 7.1756, and it ranged from 2.4430 to 11.5214. The polymorphism information content (PIC) ranged from 0.5643 (GP361) to 0.9053 (GP253) (average 0.8119). The average Shannon's information index (I) was 2.1272. Parameters of genetic diversity (Ht, Hs and Gst) and F-statistic (Fis, Fit and Fst) were estimated. The mean of total gene diversity (Ht = 0.8798) and the average interspecific genetic diversity (Dst = 0.0110) showed that G. pecorum had a relatively high level of genetic variation, which was mainly within populations. The Fixation indices as Fst ranged from 0.0029 to 0.0950, and the Number of per generation migrants (Nm) among the populations varied from 2.3814 to 85.9745. These results indicate that the heterozygosity and genetic diversity of the G. pecorum populations were very high and that gene exchange was frequent. Correlation analyses demonstrated that the number of alleles and genetic diversity of the populations were not significantly different (p = 0.2). Unweighted Pair Group Method with Arithmetic mean (UPGMA) clustering analyses revealed a genetic similarity of 0.0671 0.1118. Analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) demonstrated that the percentage of variation in the intrapopulation was small (0.67%) and the genetic variation in the G. pecorum populations was mainly exist within the species. An understanding of population genetic structure is not only crucial for assessing the actions and interactions of evolutionary forces in natural populations but also helps elucidate parasitic strategies in G. pecorum.

AB Testing for Tritrichomonas foetus and exclusion of infected animals is an effective way of improving the reproductive efficiency in a herd. Conventional PCR is inherently more specific than the culture method and quantitative PCR can significantly increase the detection limit. Loop Mediated Isothermal DNA Amplification (LAMP) is gaining interest because the method does not require expensive equipment, specificity and sensitivity can be as high as quantitative PCR. The object of this study was to develop a sensitive and friendly test for point of-care detection of T. foetus. The LAMP test that targeted T. foams elongation factor 1 alpha 1 sequences showed high specificity. Sensitivity was 100-1000 times higher than that reached through culture, polymerase chain reaction or with a previously developed LAMP for 5.8 ribosomal sequences. Moreover, T. foetus detection could be performed without DNA purification from infected cervical vaginal mucus (CVM) or smegma samples. The tf-eflal LAMP method was tested for field detection with paper strips soaked in CVM from infected cows and the results were observed 90 min later. Direct detection of T. foetus in CVM with the tf-eflal LAMP showed high sensitivity and specificity, and an overall diagnostic odds ratio of 56 (CI: 13.3-235.0). The tf-eflal LAMP showed great potential for diagnosis and control of T. foams in resource-challenged regions.

AB Coccidiosis is a major health problem in rabbits. A vaccine using Eimeria with perfect safety and effectiveness seems to be necessary to face this parasitosis. To assess the safety and the efficacy of a vaccine based on the Algerian precocious line of Eimeria magna against rabbit coccidiosis, twenty eight young rabbits from six litters of Coccidia free females were used to monitor oocystal excretion and body weights, they were distributed into four groups (vaccinated-challenged group, double challenged non vaccinated group, simple challenged non vaccinated group and control group). Three other Coccidia free rabbits served for the necropsy in order to compare the effect of the wild and the precocious strains of Eimeria magna at the histological level. Following the challenge inoculation, a statistically significant decrease of about 97% in the oocyst excretion was noticed in the vaccinated rabbits as a sign of a good immune response acquired by the vaccination associated to a good growth rate. Moreover, a statistically significant increase in oocyst output following the challenge in both double challenged non vaccinated group and simple challenged non vaccinated one was noticed: (1.2 x 10(8) and 1.5 x 10(8) vs 4.6 x 10(6) oocysts/rabbit respectively). Taking the control group showing a steady growth as a reference, the vaccinated rabbits showed a good growth during the experiment (p < 0.05). Globally the challenged groups showed a normal growth compared with the control group except for a temporary decrease in weights. No case of diarrhea was recorded in the vaccinated challenged group and the control one (neither vaccinated nor challenged) whereas more than 50% of the young rabbits from both simple and double challenged non vaccinated groups presented diarrhea. Consequently, the Algerian precocious strain of Eimeria magna constitute a good candidate for anticoccidian vaccine in the future.

ID TRYPANOSOMA-EQUIPERDUM; SERODIAGNOSIS
AB Dourine is a parasitic venereal disease of equines caused by T. equiperdum. Humoral antibodies are found in infected animals, but diagnosis of dourine must include history, clinical, and pathological findings in addition to serology. Complement Fixation Test (CFT) is the Office International des Epizooties (OIE) recommended test for international trade; however, some uninfected equines may give inconsistent or nonspecific reactions in CFT due to the anticomplementary effects of their sera. In this study an Indirect Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay (iELISA) was developed. This test could be used to confirm positive serological cases of dourine or to solve inconclusive results obtained by CFT, in addition to Indirect Fluorescent Antibody Test (IFAT) and a Chemiluminescent Immunoblotting Assay (cIB). Six-hundred-and-six CFT negative sera and 140 sera positive to CFT and IFAT were tested by iELISA using OVI C equiperdum as antigen. Results were expressed as percentage of positivity and the optimum cut-off value determined sensitivity and specificity of 100%. All positive sera, tested by cIB, were confirmed as positive. Additionally, twenty seven sera, low-positive at CFT and negative by IFAT, were tested with iELISA and cIB. All samples resulted negative by clB and one of them was positive in ELISA. Our results suggest that iELISA and cIB may be used as alternative or supplementary confirmatory tests whenever other recommended serological methods are inconclusive or doubtful.

ID MINI-FLOTAC METHODS; MCMASTER; PARASITES
AB Recommendations for control of equine strongylid parasites are based on regular determination of fecal egg counts to identify high strongylid shedders and to evaluate treatment efficacy. The McMaster technique has long been used as the standard egg counting technique in equine veterinary practice in most parts of the world, but recent work has found the Mini-FLOTAC technique to perform with significantly better accuracy and precision. The Mini-FLOTAC system comes with a homogenizing device, termed the Fill-FLOTAC, and it has been hypothesized that this device might have a significant impact on accuracy and precision. The aim of the present study was to investigate the impact of the Fill-FLOTAC homogenizer in comparison with the classical McMaster approach, where samples are suspended in flotation medium by stirring with tongue depressor in a plastic cup. The study compared the McMaster and Mini-FLOTAC techniques, but also included cross-over versions where the Fill-FLOTAC was used with the McMaster chamber, and the tongue depressor and plastic cup homogenizing method was used with the Mini-FLOTAC counting disc. Fecal samples were collected from horses naturally infected with mixed strongylid species. Five samples were included from each of the following egg count levels: 0-500, 501-1000, and > 1000 eggs per gram (EPG). Each sample was then analyzed with all four set-ups with three subsamples collected from the same suspension, and three repeated counts determined on each subsample. Both the Fill-FLOTAC homogenizer (p = 0.0098) and the McMaster counting chamber (p = 0.0298) were significantly associated with higher strongylid egg counts, whereas the Mini-FLOTAC chamber was associated with a lower coefficient of variation (p < 0.0001). Precision, however, was not associated with homogenization method (p = 0.9341). Taken together, this study suggests that while the homogenizing method has a positive effect on egg count accuracy, the counting chamber appears to primarily affect precision.

AB Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) from Electrophorus electricus (eel) was immobilized on the surface of amino-modified paramagnetic beads to serve as a model for the development, validation and application of a new affinity-based ligand-fishing assay for the discovery of bioactive peptides from complex protein mixtures such as venoms. Nano liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (nanoLC-MS) was used for the analysis of trapped peptides. Using enzyme-functionalized beads, the ligand-fishing assay was evaluated and optimized using a peptide reference mixture composed of one acetylcholinesterase binder (fasciculin-II) and five non-binders (mambalgin-1, angiotensin-II, bradykinin, cardiotoxin and alpha-bungarotoxin). As proof of concept, snake venom samples spiked with fasciculin-II demonstrated assay selectivity and sensitivity, fishing the peptide binder from complex venom solutions at concentrations as low as 1.0 mu g/mL. As negative controls for method validation, venoms of four different snake species, not known to harbor AChE binding peptides, were screened and no AChE binders were detected. The applicability of the ligand fishing assay was subsequently demonstrated with venom from the black mamba, Jameson's mamba and western green mamba (Dendroaspis spp.), which have previously been reported to contain the AChE binding fasciculins. Unknown peptides (i.e. not fasciculins) with affinity to AChE were recovered from all mamba venoms tested. Tryptic digestion followed by nano-LC-MS analysis of the material recovered from black mamba venom identified the peptide with highest AChE-binding affinity as dendrotoxin-I, a pre-synaptic neurotoxin previously not known to interact with AChE. Co-incubation of AChE with various dendrotoxins in vitro revealed reduced inactivation of AChE activity over time, thus demonstrating that these toxins stabilize AChE.

AB The Kv1.3 channel plays potential roles in immune, inflammation and coagulation system. Many studies showed that Kv1.3 channel inhibitors have immunosuppressive and anti-inflammatory activities, but no Kv1.3 channel inhibitors have been found to have anticoagulation activities. Here, based on our previous work about Kv1.3 channel toxin peptide inhibitors, we first attempt to test anticoagulation activities of four known venom-derived Kv1.3 channel inhibitors with different structural folds: BmKTX with CS alpha/beta structural fold, OmTx3 with CS alpha/alpha structural fold, BF9 with Kuntz-type structural fold, and SjAPI-2 with Ascaris-type structural fold. Our results showed that BmKTX and OmTx3 have no activities towards both intrinsic and extrinsic coagulation pathway, SjAPI-2 just has weak activity towards intrinsic coagulation pathway, and BF9 has potent activity towards intrinsic coagulation pathway with no apparent effect on extrinsic coagulation pathway. Enzyme and inhibitor reaction kinetics experiments further showed that BF9 inhibited intrinsic coagulation pathway-associated coagulation factor XIa, but have no apparent effects on common coagulation pathway coagulation factor Ha. Structure-activity relationship showed that Gly14, Asn17, Ala18 and Ile20 of BF9 are main residues involved in the inhibiting effect on factor XIa. To the best of our knowledge, BF9 is the first anticoagulant with Kv1.3 channel inhibitory activity. Together, our present studies found the first dual functional peptides with Kv1.3 channel and coagulation factor XIa inhibitory activities, and provided a new molecular template for the lead drug discovery towards immune and thrombosis-associated human diseases.

AB Okadaic acid (OA) is one of the most common and widespread marine toxins and causes acute gastrointestinal symptoms known as diarrheic shellfish poisoning (DSP) in humans. Although OA is not classified as a typical neurotoxin, an increasing number of studies have reported its neurotoxic effects. However, most of the available studies have focused on OA-induced inhibition of serine/threonine protein phosphatases, while the molecular mechanism of OA-induced neurotoxicity remains largely unclear. To better understand the potentially toxicological profile of OA, cell cycle arrest, DNA damage and alterations in gene expression in the human neuroblastoma cell line SHSY5Y upon OA exposure were determined using flow cytometry, comet assay, and transcriptome microarray. The results showed that OA could induce cell cycle arrest at S phase and might be involved in significant DNA strand breaks. Gene expression profiling indicated that the differentially expressed genes after OA exposure were significantly enriched in the "DNA replication" and "cell cycle" pathways. Real-time PCR result had further validated that down-regulation of the Cdc45/Mcm2-7/GINS complex might be the major factor regulating those alterations. These findings provide new insight into the molecular mechanisms of OA-induced neurotoxicity, and the current data may also provide a basis for future studies.

AB Bothrops snakebite treatment is antivenom therapy, which is ineffective in neutralizing the severe local effects caused by these envenomations. There are evidence that photobiomodulation therapy (PBMT) has emerged as a promising tool to counteract the venom-induced local effects. The purpose was to write a narrative review of the literature about PBMT as a treatment for Bothrops snakebites. We reviewed articles indexed in PubMed, SCOPUS and Scientif Direct database with filter application. Included studies had to investigate local effects induced by Bothrops snake venom in any animal model using any type of photobiomodulation irradiation and at least one quantitative measure of local effects of Bothrops envenomation. Sixteen studies were selected from 54 original articles targeted PBMT (low-level laser or light emitting diode) as a complementary tool for local effects treatment induced by snakebites, and all its assessments. Articles were critically assessed by two independent raters with a structured tool for rating the research quality. PBMT demonstrate to be a promising tool for local treatment effects caused by snakebite by reducing local edema, hyperalgesia, leukocyte influx and myonecrosis and accelerating tissue regeneration related to myotoxicity. However, the mechanism is not well understood and additional studies are needed.

The clinical signs of H. lepturus envenomation, including dermonecrosis, hematuria, renal failure and early death, are attributed to phospholipase D activity. This study was conducted to develop a novel recombinant phospholipase D1 (rPLD1) toxoid and investigate its immunogenicity and protective effects against the lethality of H. lepturus venom. The lethal protein recombinant phospholipase D1 was expressed from PLD H. lepturus venom gland. The rPLD1 toxin was converted into toxoid (the first toxoid of H. lepturus PLD) with a 0.25% concentration of formalin and stored for ten days at room temperature. In the toxicity test, the lethal activity of recombinant phospholipase D1 was fully inhibited. When it reached up to 3 times higher than the maximal effective concentration of the purified toxin (11.1 mu g), rPLD1 toxoid was used. The sphingomyelinase activity was inhibited when up to 5.4 times of the LD100 of the purified toxin (20 mu g), toxoid was used. It was then used to produce an antibody in BALB/c as an antigen and the mice were then challenged with rPLD1 toxin and the whole venom. The immunogenicity of rPLD1 toxoid was evaluated and the maximum titer of the raised antibodies was determined by ELISA assay. The optimum titer for anti-rPLD1 toxoid sera was obtained at the third intraperitoneal injection of rPLD1 toxoid, and a high titer was reached at the fourth injection in the mice. This toxoid increased the amount of antibodies and produced a protective antiserum against the whole venom of H. lepturus and rPLD1 toxin. The in-vivo test results showed that the mice were completely resistant against 200 times the LD100 of recombinant phospholipase D1 and the whole venom of H. lepturus. To conclude, rPLD1 can be used in toxoid form as an immunogen in the production of a new generation of neutralizing antibodies against the lethality and toxicity of H. lepturus whole venom.

AB Macrovipera lebetina obtusa (Dwigubsky, 1832) and Montivipera xanthina (Gray, 1849) (Ottoman Viper) are viper snakes from Viperidae family and found in various locations in Anatolia. Both snakes are responsible for major snake bite cases in Turkey Their venoms cause necrosis, hemorrhage, pain and local edema.
   Centaurea L. (Asteraceae) species draw attention as potential anti-inflammatory sources due to their traditional uses and accomplished studies on this field. C. calolepis Boiss. is an endemic taxon distributed in Aegean and Antalya regions in Turkey. Chloroform extract of C. calolepis and its major compound cnicin, a sesquiterpene lactone, are reported to have strong anti-inflammatory activities in-vitro, by previous studies.
   In the present study, in-vivo anti-inflammatory activities of C. calolepis chloroform extract and the sesquiterpenoid cnicin against edema induced by Macrovipera lebetina obtusa and Montivipera xanthina venoms were evaluated in the rat model. Protein contents and induction doses of the venoms were determined. Carrageenan and snake venoms were used as inducing agents in paw edema tests.
   Extract demonstrated strong inhibition on edema at all doses and hours against M. xanthina venom and carrageenan. Inhibition ratio of extract at 25 mg/kg dose (84.13% inhibition) after 0.5 h M. xanthina venom injection was more than indomethacin's value (45.4% inhibition). The extract also showed significant effect also on inflammation caused by M. lebetina obtusa venom at all doses. However, 2.5 mg/kg cnicin was more effective than total extract of C. calolepis against rat paw edema induced by (27.31%) M. lebetina obtusa venom.
   This is the first study reported therapeutic potential of C. calolepis, an endemic plant of Turkey, in case of snake-bites cause inflammation by venomous species in natural fauna of Anatolia.

AB Arthropods are a diverse and ancient group of invertebrate animals, which constitute approximately 75-85% of all known species on earth. Many arthropod species, such as spiders, scorpions and even some crustaceans, contain venoms that can be very complex, representing natural combinatorial libraries of bioactive compounds. Characterization of the compounds in these libraries has helped the development of tools for pharmacology, and the discovery of lead molecules for therapeutic treatments. A critical aspect in the characterization of venom compounds is determination of three-dimensional structure. Structural analysis can provide insight into many processes including understanding target interactions and developing more potent and selective drug leads. Arthropod venoms are an extremely rich source of novel structures and this review provides an overview of this structural diversity, including structures of proteins, peptides and small molecules.

AB The effect of age on larkspur poisoning of cattle is unknown. An experiment consisting of oral dosing of dried, ground, Delphinium barbeyi to ten Angus steers as yearlings, and again at two years was performed. There was a significant difference between the responses of yearling and two year old steers (P = 0.0015), with yearling steers being more susceptible. These results suggest that the adverse response of Angus cattle to larkspur is age-dependent.

AB With the introduction of powerful mass spectrometry equipment into the field of snake venom proteomics, a large body of venomics data is accumulating. To allow for better comparison between venom compositions from different snake species and to provide an online database containing this data, we devised the Snake Venomics Display toolbox for visualization of snake venomics data on linear scales. This toolbox is freely available to be used online at https://tropicalpharmacology.com/tools/snake-venomics-display/ and allows researchers to visualize venomics data in a Relative Abundance (%) visualization mode and in an Absolute Abundance (mg) visualization mode, the latter taking venom yields into account. The curated venomics data for all snake species included in this database is also made available in a downloadable Excel file format. The Snake Venomics Display toolbox represents a simple way of handling snake venomics data, which is better suited for large data sets of venom compositions from multiple snake species.

AB Spider venom is being researched for its potential use in applications such as insecticides, to better understand the dynamics of neuronal ion channel physiology and as potential remedies to counter antibiotic resistant bacteria. However, spider venom is more widely known for its ability to cause deleterious reactions after toxic envenomations in humans. In this short review, the "dark" side of spider venoms is presented to provide a counterbalance to the investigations of the positive potential that venoms can or might improve our world or its understanding. The goal was to present a short primer on species having clinical consequences in humans rather than be an exhaustive review of all spiders of medical importance.

AB The majority of fatalities from poisonous mushroom ingestion are caused by amatoxins. To prevent liver failure or death, it is critical to accurately and rapidly diagnose amatoxin exposure. We have developed a liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry method to detect alpha-, beta-, and gamma-amanitin in urine to meet this need. Two internal standard candidates were evaluated, including an isotopically labeled N-15(10)-alpha-amanitin and a modified amanitin methionine sulfoxide synthetic peptide. Using the N-15(10)-alpha-amanitin internal standard, precision and accuracy of a-amanitin in pooled urine was <= 5.49% and between 100 and 106%, respectively, with a reportable range from 1-200 ng/mL. beta- and gamma-Amanitin were most accurately quantitated in pooled urine using external calibration, resulting in precision <= 17.2% and accuracy between 99 and 105% with calibration ranges from 2.5-200 ng/mL and 1.0-200 ng/mL, respectively. The presented urinary diagnostic test is the first method to use an isotopically labeled alpha-amanitin with the ability to detect and confirm human exposures to alpha-, beta-, and gamma-amanitin.

AB Loxosceles venom is a potential source of bioactive molecules which may be transformed into antimicrobial products against multi-resistant bacteria. Here, it was investigated whether Loxosceles gaucho spider had any influence on the proliferation, enzyme release and biofilm formation of a Pseudomonas aeruginosa strain resistant to two different classes of antibiotic. The results demonstrated that L. gaucho whole venom has no influence on P. aeruginosa proliferation. However, it increases P. aeruginosa production of gelatinase, caseinase and biofilm formation. The same effects were noted when P. aeruginosa was exposed to a L. gaucho venom molecular fraction with mass lower than 1 kDa. Separation of this molecular fraction into different subsets by RP-HPLC demonstrated that, among the molecules with the ability to increase the production of enzymes and biofilm formation, there are some with antimicrobial activities whose effects are not observed in the whole venom. In summary, the results obtained herein indicate that L. gaucho venom has a variety of low molecular mass bioactive components that influence the mechanisms of virulence of P. aeruginosa in different ways.

AB The Tityus serrulatus scorpion species represents a serious human health threat to in Brazil because it is among the animals that produces the most dangerous venoms for mammals in South America. Its venom has provided several highly selective ligands that specifically interact with sodium and potassium channels. During the past decades, several international groups published an increasing amount of data on the isolation and the chemical, pharmacological and immunological characterisation of its main beta-toxin, Ts1. In this review, we compiled the best available past and recent knowledge on Ts1. Aside from its intricate purification, the state-of-the-art understanding concerning its pharmacological activities is presented. Its solved three-dimensional structure is shown, as well as the possible surface areas of contact between Ts1 and its diverse voltage-gated Na+ channel targets. Organisations of the gene and the precursor encoding Ts1 are also tackled based on available cDNA clones or on information obtained from polymerase chain reactions of stretches of scorpion DNA. At last, the immunological studies complete with Ts1 to set up an efficient immunotherapy against the Tityus serrulatus venom are summarized.

AB The limited number of centipede venom characterizations have revealed a rich diversity of toxins, and recent work has suggested centipede toxins may be more rapidly diversifying than previously considered. Additionally, many identified challenges in venomics research, including assembly and annotation methods, toxin quantification, and the ability to provide biological or technical replicates, have yet to be addressed in centipede venom characterizations. We performed high-throughput, quantifiable transcriptomic and proteomic methods on two individual Scolopendra viridis centipedes from North Florida. We identified 39 toxins that were proteomically confirmed, and 481 nontoxins that were expressed in the venom gland of S. viridis. The most abundant toxins expressed in the venom of S. viridis belonged to calcium and potassium ion-channel toxins, venom allergens, metalloproteases, and beta-pore forming toxins. We compared our results to the previously characterized S. viridis from Morelos, Mexico, and found only five proteomically confirmed toxins in common to both localities, suggesting either extreme toxin divergence within S. viridis, or that these populations may represent entirely different species. By using multiple assembly and annotation methods, we generated a comprehensive and quantitative reference transcriptome and proteome of a Scolopendromorpha centipede species, while overcoming some of the challenges present in venomics research.

AB The impacts of lipid crystallinity on in vitro digestive lipolysis and bioaccessibility of encapsulated (0.1 wt%) beta-carotene (BC) were investigated for a 15 wt% cocoa butter emulsion prepared as crystalline (i.e. solid emulsions, SE & SE-BC) or undercooled (liquid emulsions, LE & LE-BC) droplets at 25 degrees C. Particle size distributions (D-4,D-3 similar to 0.7 mu m), morphology (spherical), polymorphism (beta-V), thermal behavior (peak melting similar to 30 degrees C), zeta potential (similar to-44 mV) and BC degradation under accelerated lighting conditions were similarly extensive. Following exposure to simulated gastric conditions, duodenal hydrolysis and BC bioaccessibility were lower for SE-BC up to 2 h (P < 0.05). Ultimately, samples with both solid and liquid droplets were hydrolyzed extensively and BC bioaccessibility did not differ (P > 0.05). Therefore, for compositionally equivalent emulsions, lipid droplet solid state delayed digestive lipolysis and bioactive solubilization. These results help to clarify the role of lipid physical state on dietary lipid digestion and bioactive release.

AB Coke-oven gas (COG) is largely by-produced in coking plants, being most burnt and resulting in serious energy waste and air pollutant emissions. Producing high-value hydrogen from COG is therefore promising, however, the traditional processes via steam methane reforming still suffer from high energy consumption and CO2 emissions. In this work, we propose efficient COG-to-hydrogen processes by chemical looping hydrogen technology. Parameter optimization of the proposed systems without and with support has also been conducted for the optimum COG utilization and maximum hydrogen production. The optimum molar ratios for the oxygen carrier/COG, steam/oxygen carrier, and air/oxygen carrier were found to be 2.0, 1.2, and 0.81, respectively, for the process without support. In the supported system, due to the presence of the high-temperature support, the optimum molar ratio of the oxygen carrier/COG is decreased to 1.1, while the steam/oxygen carrier ratio is increased to 3.9. The exergy efficiency, and CO2 capture efficiency, and hydrogen purity of the system with support are 63.8%, 73.3%, and 99.4 mol.%, respectively. It was found that the process including an intercooling between fuel reactor and steam reactor, and oxygen-enriched combustion in the heating air reactor provides a further improved exergy efficiency of 66.2% and CO2 capture efficiency of about 100%.

DE Passive house; Energy conservation measures; Solar heaters;
   Photovoltaic; Net-zero energy house (NZEH)
AB This paper presents the end-use energy performance analysis of the eastern unit of a duplex built based on Passive House Standard requirements in Portland, OR, USA. The energy consumption evaluation showed that this unit has 7.75, 34, 91 kWh/m(2) year of heating demand, total site consumption, and primary energy consumption, respectively. A detailed energy analysis was used to explore pathways through which the house could be transformed into a net-zero energy house (NZEH). A model of the eastern unit was calibrated against measured data to perform a detailed energy analysis not only for heating energy, but also including energy used for cooling, water heater, plug loads, electric appliances, and kitchen appliances. Based on this analysis we conclude that two steps are required in order to transform a passive house into a NZEH. First, opportunities for energy conservation measures (ECMs) must be identified. In this study, changes in natural ventilation and occupant behavior were the most effective measures. Modeled implementation of these measures led to energy consumption reduction of 814 kWh/year (-17%), and 0.1 tons of avoided CO2/year. The second step was to investigate the most appropriate renewable energy systems; photovoltaic (PV) panels and solar water heating were evaluated. Integrating PV panels over an area of 26 m(2) was sufficient to balance the remaining annual energy demand (3936 kWh/year) by producing 4053 kWh/year with a payback period of 15.4-years. On the other hand, using thermal solar water heating was found to reduce the energy consumption by 3047 kWh/year (64%); the remaining energy demand can be overcome by integrating a total of 13 m(2) of PV panels. The latter approach has around a 20-year payback period and saves 0.6 tons of CO2/year. We therefore conclude that the first approach of using PV panels is more cost-effective for transforming a passive house to a ZEH for the climate of the northwest US.

AB In present work, a novel configuration of vapor compression-absorption integrated refrigeration system (VCAIRS) is analyzed. Unlike previous vapor compression-absorption cascaded refrigeration system (VCACRS), proposed configuration works at lower generator temperature of 60 degrees C. Thus, allowing the use of low grade waste heat for its operation. The performance of VCAIRS is also compared with the equivalent vapor compression refrigeration system (VCRS) and VCACRS for the same cooling capacity of 100 kW. The comparative study result shows that electrical energy requirement in VCAIRS is 21.4% more as compared to VCACRS but it is still 63% less as compared to the equivalent VCRS. Further, the second law efficiency of VCAIRS, VCACRS and VCRS are determined to be 27.9%, 32.7% and 18.8%, respectively. Thus, both the VCAIRS and VCACRS are energy and exergy efficient configurations; but, VCACRS results in more energy efficient cooling technology in the foreseeable future as it utilizes heat at lower generator temperature as compared to VCACRS.
   After the comparative performance study, the exergetic performance of VCAIRS is further explored based on the coefficient of structural bonds (CSB) and advanced exergy analysis methods. Highest CSB of 4.39 is obtained for high pressure solution heat exchanger but its overall contribution in total irreversibility rate is merely 0.2%; whereas, the highest contribution of 17.4% in total irreversibility rate is by compressor 1 but CSB value computed for it is merely 1.73. Further, advance exergy analysis results show that 35.2% of total irreversibility rate of VCAIRS can be avoided by improving the efficiency parameter of components of system.

AB A single-chamber dynamic membrane microbial fuel cell (SC-DM-MFC) that uses an activated carbon fiber felt (ACFF) non-structural air-breathing cathode was designed for enhanced power production. The effect of COD loading rate (based on glucose substrate) on power production by SC-DM-MFC was studied. In order to investigate the impact of natural breeze on the performance of SC-DM-MFC via increased air flow, the effect of cathode fanning was studied. The maximum power density increased with an increase in the loading rate from 0.6 to 2.0 gCOD d(-1) and fanning the cathode improved the power density from 2023 mW(-3) to 4653 mW m(-3). This increase is attributed to the unique nonstructural design of the cathode that allows both sides of ACFF to reduce oxygen in ambient air. Furthermore, the performance of SC-DM-MFC and a dual chamber dynamic membrane microbial fuel cell (DC-DM-MFC) was compared. In the comparison test, seafood processing wastewater was used as a substrate because of its high conductivity, biodegradable properties, and rich nutrient content that make it suitable for the growth of electrogenic bacteria. The results show that it is feasible to generate power in DM-MFCs using seafood wastewater and that SC-DM-MFC performs significantly better than DC-DM-MFC. Enhanced power production can be achieved by using an air-breathing ACFF cathode with nonstructural properties.

AB A unified description to maximize the work output of reciprocating internal combustion engine is given in this paper. A dual-Miller cycle as a universal cycle for reciprocating internal combustion engine has been selected and established by a new design method. The results show that the work output has linear relationship with the intake temperature, friction coefficient, working fluid, chemical energy release by combustion and heat-transfer coefficient, while there are optimal values of the cut-off ratio, pressure ratio, geometric-compression ratio, specific heat ratio and expansion-compression ratio at which the work output attain their maxima. Thus, the work output can be differentiated with respect to the optimal values and set the resultant derivative equal to zero. In this paper, the results obtained show that the maximum work output of the dual-Miller cycle is greater than that of the classical-Otto, classical-Diesel, classical-dual, Otto-Miller, Diesel-Miller, Otto-Atkinson, Diesel-Atkinson and dual-Atkinson cycles at their optimal values of the cut-off ratio, pressure ratio, geometric-compression ratio, specific heat ratio and expansion-compression ratio, as well as at the same values of the intake temperature, friction coefficient, working fluid, chemical energy release by combustion and heat-transfer coefficient.

AB Direct absorption methane digester can accomplish the coupled process of solar heat collection and photo and biochemical reaction of microorganisms simultaneously. In present work, a numerical model was developed to determine a tool to investigate the photo biochemical transformation process for developing engineering analyses, which is a coupled one of the simplified ADM1 model and the heat and mass transfer model. The model was validated by experimental data from two groups of different experiments. The effect of solar irradiance on the photo biochemical transformation process was also investigated by the model. The results show that a good agreement has been obtained between experimental data and simulations, which can be achieved in most of time. The study found that increasing solar irradiance is an effective method to improve the biogas production rate of direct absorption methane digester. With the solar irradiance increasing, the volume average temperature increases and the rates of biogas production, substrate reaction and total propionate all turn bigger. The effect of solar irradiance on biogas production rate is bigger than the one on the rate of propionic acid. In order to increase the heat storage of digester, the slurry surface evaporation of digester should be restrained.

AB The wind industry is currently facing a major challenge due to the ageing of the wind turbines that were first commissioned. Recent wind turbine designs present higher power performance and lower maintenance requirements than older wind turbines. Furthermore, most of the old wind turbines are installed in the best sites for wind resource exploitation. Under this framework, the repowering of wind farms with the replacement of the old machines by new designs is recognised as a focus area for the wind industry. This paper performs a techno-economic analysis of a real wind farm repowering experience at the Malpica wind farm, located in the Northwest of Spain. Results show the annual energy production of the repowered wind farm increases up to twofold that of the old wind farm with the same rated power. Moreover, the economic analysis reveals the project yields satisfactory profitability, even without reliance on public subsidies as currently happens in Spain. In addition, a sensitivity analysis allows us to understand the effects of the uncertainties over the lifetime of the wind farm, and how they affect the projects performance and profitability.

AB In China, the utilisation of low-temperature waste heat (especially at temperatures lower than 100 degrees C) plays a significant role in increasing the energy-consumption efficiency in the industry. The organic Rankine cycle (ORC) is considered as a promising method to recover the aforementioned part of the waste heat. In the study, six potential candidates, namely R141b, R142b, R245ca, R245fa, R600a, and R601a were screened from 12 dry or adiabatic organic working fluids based on their thermodynamic performances in the ORC. A multi-objective optimisation (MOO) was performed for the thermodynamic performance (exergy efficiency, EXE) and economic performance (levelised energy cost, LEC) by using non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-II (NSGA-II). The Pareto frontiers were obtained for the six candidates with the algorithm, and each optimal compromise solution was accurately obtained with the fuzzy set theory. Based on the EXE and LEC of the optimal compromise solution, the total cost and power generation efficiency for the six candidates were determined. This was used to obtain an explicit evaluation index in economic performance, namely static investment payback period (SIPP), to identify that the R245ca corresponded to the most cost-effective working fluid with the shortest SIPP. This suggests R245ca was the fastest to cover the investment and cost of the ORC system. Furthermore, a fast decision-making method was introduced to select the optimal working fluid based on the grey relational analysis (GRA) by considering key physical property parameters of the working fluids. The results suggest that any potential working fluid to recover low-temperature waste heat in the ORC can be evaluated by the simplified grey relational degree (SGRD) proposed in the study.

AB This paper presents a simulation study to explore the flexibility of a pool of residential combined heat and power plants (cogeneration systems) coupled with thermal storages. Flexibility is identified by sending daily trigger signals (ON and OFF) of various signal lengths to a pool of 60 micro cogeneration systems over the course of one year. A randomization approach is used in order to reflect realistic system sizing based on commercially available components. Each system operates individually based on its thermal demand. The response of the pool to the external signals is evaluated. Flexibility is characterized by flexible power, flexible energy and pool regeneration time. Results show that both signal types can potentially activate a significant amount of flexible power and energy. The flexibility is highly dependent on the ambient temperature and the signal duration.

AB Steam ejectors are regarded as a promising energy-saving technology, it is thus crucial to enhance its working performance for broader application horizons. In this study, a detailed simulation is made of a design steam ejector used in MED-TVC desalination system. The results discloses that there is actually a large entrained flow blocked region downstream the entraining entrance and significant low-pressure potentials inside the throat and diffuser whose pressure are far lower than that of the blocked region. Based on this finding, a so-called pressure regulation technology is proposed to use these existing pressure differences to dredge the blocked entrained flow, and thus more entrained steam could be drawn into the ejector. Then the feasibility verifications of different pressure regulation schemes are carried out, and a systematic analysis and investigation of their influences on the entrainment performance has been implemented systematically from the mass flow rate and pressure field. The results reveal that there is an optimum combination of pressure regulation schemes to dredge the blocked entrained flow effectively, by which a maximum and considerable entrainment ratio improvement could be achieved, as large as 26.85% in the covered simulations, and with 3.31% even under the design condition. To be specific, the throat-entraining entrance downstream pressure regulation should be adopted if the ejector operates under the design condition, otherwise, the combined-entraining entrance downstream pressure regulation is the best choice.

AB For many years, investigation of impacts of variation of effective parameters on the evaporative cooling systems performance has been limited to the thermodynamic or hydraulic analyses, while economic issues, consumption of all resources together and capability of the cooler to provide thermal comfort in the ranges of variation have not been considered. In order to cover all the three above-mentioned shortcomings and provide an applicable realistic point of view from the system operation, this research is done. For a two-stage direct-indirect evaporative cooler, the impacts of variation of effective parameters on different performance criteria of the system, including each stage outlet air conditions, cooling capacity, resource consumption and their ratios, operating and initial costs are investigated while for smart selection of the variation range of the effective parameters, a novel approach based on employing thermal comfort indices is proposed. In addition, the economic analysis is done for diverse existing water to electricity tariff conditions all around the world. It is found that there is a trade-off between performance criteria when the working to inlet air ratio of the second-stage increases, so it has an optimum value. In addition, using pads with higher specific contact areas is recommended as one of the most economical strategies to enhance the system. The results also show that the best values for inlet air velocity and pad thickness area are minimum possible magnitudes. These values for this study are 0.4 m s(-1) and 5 cm, respectively.

AB Characterizing and modeling the energy consumption of machining processes has been recognized as an effective measure to improve the energy efficiency of the manufacturing process and to reduce carbon emissions. Activities related to machine tools and operators in machining processes result in energy consumption and carbon emissions. However, energy evaluation for the activities related to operators has often been ignored in the energy modeling of machining processes, due to its complexity and variability. Consequently, energy-saving strategies developed without considering the energy consumption of operators are not optimal. To bridge this gap, this paper develops an energy consumption evaluation method for the activities related to machine tools and operators, and establishes a novel energy model of machine-operator systems to assess the energy efficiency of machining processes. The research results provide a promising method to identify new energy-saving potentials of machine-operator systems. The recommended energy-saving strategy regarding this method is different to traditional strategies, but with it a better energy-saving effect can be achieved. Finally, a case study of energy modeling and analysis for a CK6153i CNC machine-operator system is examined, showing an energy saving potential of 15.85% and illustrating the effectiveness of the proposed method.

AB The performance of a three straight bladed Cross-Flow or Vertical Axis Turbine based on symmetrical profiles, with a chord-to-diameter ratio of 0.16 has been studied in detail. The research is focused on the effects of Reynolds number and blade pitch angle, not only in the performance itself, but in the appearance or not of a dead band region in which aerodynamic loading cannot overcome resistive loads. Experiments were carefully designed in order to cover the transitional region were this dead band is incipient, for Reynolds numbers in the range from 3 to 5.10(5).
   Results show how the performance is highly dependent on pitch angle at all Reynolds numbers investigated. Efficiencies over 25% are reached at tip speed ratios (blade to free stream velocity ratio) slightly larger than 2, for pitch angles in the range 4-8 degrees. The appearance of the dead band is conditioned by the combination of Reynolds number and pitch angle.

AB Considering the effects of unpredictable disturbances, a robustness criterion is newly proposed to develop an integrated evaluation with modified efficiency criterion, for comprehensive assessments of energy conversion performances in direct methanol fuel cells. The effectiveness of developed criteria in various situations (including some extreme operating conditions) has been carefully analyzed based on both experimental and numerical results. For undisturbed operations, the modified efficiency criterion could help to avoid potential misinterpretations of energy conversion process in existing criteria. For disturbed operations, the robustness criterion concerning the effects of uncertainty propagations is shown to be an effective guidance for the determination of appropriate operating current densities to design efficiency-stabilized operations. Systematic analysis on its applications in different situations proves that, the integrated efficiency and robustness evaluations can effectively differentiate the effects of operating conditions and membrane types, which is highly beneficial for one's optimal designs of stable and efficient DMFC operations.

AB Analytic relations are developed that directly link visually observable features of differential thermogravimetric (DTG) curves (e.g., peak temperature, height, width, skewness and conversion at the peak) to the parameters of chemical reaction kinetics models (e.g., activation energy and prefactor), which can be used to study the thermal decomposition of solid fuels. General expressions suitable for any reaction model are provided, as well as explicit expressions for nth order reactions with a rate constant given by the Arrhenius equation. This approach is illustrated for the pyrolysis of biomass, where it is found to provide a rapid and accurate estimate of the relative contributions of cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin to the volatile yield, as well as their kinetic parameters. The method offers a simple way to obtain the model reaction kinetics parameters from thermogravimetric data and saves computing time by providing sensible initial values and bounds of the fit parameters.

AB The residues of food waste after removing waste cooking oils could be converted to microbial lipid by oleaginous yeasts and microbial lipid could be used as a raw material of biodiesel with waste cooking oils. This process would have positive environmental and economic benefits. However, the composition of food waste is extremely complex. Many types of organic acids, such as lactic acid and acetic acid, could be accumulated during the collection, transportation and storage processes. The effects of these substances on microbial lipid production remained unknown. In this study, food waste saccharified liquid (FWSL) without any additional nutrients was fed to Rhodosporidium toruloides 2.1389 for microbial lipid production. Total biomass concentration, lipid concentration and lipid yield increased by 87.4%, 69.4% and 69.3%, respectively, compared with the YPD medium. Remarkably, increasing the concentration of lactic acid in the medium promoted the total biomass concentration of yeast. Furthermore, lipid concentration decreased slightly when single lactic acid or single acetic acid concentration was below 5 g/L or 1 g/L in the culture media. Metal elements that were present in the medium had considerable synergistic effects on lipid production. When four metal elements (i.e. Mg, Ca, Na and K) were present in the medium, total biomass concentration, lipid concentration, lipid content and lipid yield increased by 22.01%, 33.51%, 9.43% and 33.33%, respectively, compared with those in the control group. The interaction among the FWSL compositions that led to the promotion of microbial lipid production was beyond the inhibition effect. The engineering implication analysis evidently suggested that the process of microbial lipid production from FWSL was economically feasible and had potential industrial application prospects.

AB During the last decades, the adoption of more strict safety and environmental regulations, as well as a rise in energy costs, sparked an increasing interest in the design of renewable energies systems, particularly solar systems, to supply both electrical power and heat. Because of their capability to simultaneously supply both electricity and heat, concentrating photovoltaic-thermal and thermoelectric hybrid systems have recently attracted scholarly attention. In this study, a detailed three-dimensional computational model of a novel concentrating photovoltaic-thermal solar system combined with thermoelectric modules in an integrated design with a triangular absorber and corresponding numerical simulations are presented. For this purpose, a three-dimensional integrated model combined the Finite Volume method with the Monte Carlo Ray-Tracing method is employed. After validating simulation results and providing some discussions on the effects of temperature and cooling on the photovoltaic modules performance, the impacts of varying two design parameters of the system, the aperture width of the reflector and the apex angle of the absorber, on the solar energy flux distribution and output power of photovoltaic modules are discussed. Finally, considering the conditions of the case study, a range of aperture widths for the reflector and apex angles for the triangular absorber are proposed.

AB Hybrid photovoltaic-wind energy systems are being designed and implemented as stand-alone or grid connected generation systems, due to the need to use local, environmental friendly and low cost energy sources. In this study, a novel methodology to optimize the size of an autonomous hybrid photovoltaic-wind power system with battery storage is presented. A multi-objective optimization problem is considered with two objective functions, the total net present cost and a new reliability indicator called maximum expected energy not supplied, which is calculated using a probabilistic approach. The non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-II was utilized to find the model solution. The results obtained with the presented methodology were compared with those from traditional methodologies, with the proposed methodology generating a set of feasible solutions, with respect to the system economy and reliability, which maximizes the use of renewable sources and reduces the size of the system backup.

AB The inspiration of the present work emerges from the formulation to enhance the combustion, emission and performance of a single cylinder diesel engine through modifying the fuel by adding an additive together with water-in-diesel emulsion fuel. 1,4-dioxane a hygroscopic, multipurpose substance was considered as one of the irreplaceable additive to be included with the ideal mix of DWS (89.8%diesel + 10%water + 0.2%surfactant) to enhance the engine attributes. In the present work, 1,4-dioxane was mixed with the optimized blend of DWS (10% water and 89.8% diesel), with varying concentrations of 5, 10, 15, 20% and denoted as DWSA5, DWSA10, DWSA15, DWSA20 respectively. With the expansion of 1,4-dioxane, the physical properties were enhanced. The sample fuels were analyzed with Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) in order to find functional groups. An experiment was conducted with test fuels in a single cylinder, unmodified diesel engine. From the experimental data, it was revealed that, brake thermal efficiency (BTE) of DWSA10 increases up to 7% when compared with diesel fuel. Hydrocarbon (HC) and smoke decreases up to 31.66%, 27.83% respectively with diesel fuel. Brake specific energy consumption (BSEC) and carbon monoxide (CO) of DWSA10 decreased about 7.5%, 15% respectively on par with DWS fuel. From the obtained results, it was identified that test fuel (DWSA10) containing 10% 1,4-dioxane shows significant improvement in the engine performance and reduction in emission. DWSA10 may play a significant role for diesel engine in future without modifying the engine.

AB This paper investigates the syngas production in a hybrid filtration reactor composed of aleatory waste tires particles and alumina spheres. Parameters as reaction wave temperature, propagation rate and gaseous and solid emissions products were measured as a function of gasifier agents (air and steam) and natural gas presence. Hydrogen and carbon monoxide concentrations in the reaction products were determined by gas chromatography and solid emissions by X-ray spectrometry. Downstream reaction zone propagation was observed in all experiments yielding high reaction temperature (1,100-1,500 K) responsible of: (1) generating H-2 and CO as main products of the process for different gasifier agents and natural gas presence, and (2) decreased solid particles emissions in comparison with temperatures below 1,100 K. X-ray spectrometry with total reflection was able to detect peaks of Zn and Fe, thought to originate from waste tires particles as well as from reactors insulation material. It was detected that pure air had the best performance as a gasifier agent.

AB An absorption-compression heat pump is a promising way to recover low-temperature waste heat efficiently in industrial applications. In this paper, an advanced ammonia-water absorption-compression heat pump is proposed to recover the sensible heat of flue gas below 150 degrees C to generate saturated steam at 0.5 MPa (151.8 degrees C). The sensible heat is cascade utilized in the hybrid heat pump system. The high-temperature waste heat is recovered to generate pure ammonia vapor in the rectifier, and the low-temperature heat is used to evaporate the ammonia liquid. In the ammonia vapor compression process, the gas compression process is combined with a liquid compression process, leading to the clear decrease in power consumption. The simulation results indicate that the coefficient of performance and exergy efficiency of the proposed system reaches 5.49 and 27.62%, which is almost two times and 4.69% higher than that of the reference system, respectively. Subsequently, a sensitivity analysis is conducted to optimizing the key parameters, and the optimums values are obtained. Finally, an economic analysis is adopted to evaluate the economic performance of the proposed system. The payback period of the proposed system is 6.26 years compared to the reference system. This study may provide a new way to produce saturated steam by efficiently using the low-temperature waste heat.

AB Large solar power plants in recent years has gained a momentary attraction since, the demand estimated for next few years has benchmarked has a monumental requirement for electrical energy. However, the solar power parks are often concerned with the shade occurrence resulting in power reduction. Hence, array reconfiguration schemes have became extremely popular to minimize the power loss under shade occurrences. In this paper, a new column index method based on one time physical relocation scheme is proposed. The proposed method possesses the advantage of having simple rewiring requirements since; the panels are rearranged in the respective column itself. Various parameters like mismatch loss and power loss are effectively measured and fill factor for four various shade occurrences are calculated. Simulation verification along with theoretical validation is performed for four existing schemes in literature. To strengthen the analysis, very recent Dominance Square (DS) method is also critically analyzed and compared. Finally, a qualitative comparison with various methods in literature is performed to contribute for quality check.

AB The Reformer Steam Iron Cycle (RESC) is suitable to attain high-purity pressurized hydrogen from a broad range of renewables and residues in decentralized on-site applications. This paper introduces a 10 kW(th) lab prototype system for high purity hydrogen production exceeding 99.999%. The significantly enlarged reactor system comprises of a combined steam reformer and fixed bed chemical looping system within a single unit. A series of experiments was conducted to demonstrate the system applicability for decentralized hydrogen production with an improved process layout. A previously undiscovered hydrogen purity was realized from a fixed-bed chemical looping prototype system. Supplementary, the applied oxygen carrier material was characterized to reveal occurring degradation effects in large-size reactors as a significantly increased thermal stress. A characterization by SEM, EDX, light microscopy and BET methods was performed to exhibit the effects on the pelletised material.

AB This paper aims at performing a parametric analysis of the thermoeconomics costs associated with an integrated solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) system with a vapour-adsorption refrigeration (VAR) system. Particular emphasis is put on the cost of the SOFC's product (i.e. the electrical energy) and on the cost of the VAR's product (i.e. the cooling effect). In order to do so, an hybrid system simulator was constructed to determine the influence of SOFC operating parameters: current density, inlet flow temperature, fuel utilization factor and steam to carbon ratio, on the exergy-based costs of the products as well as on the exergoeconomic factors. Results of the analysis show that an energy-based costing can lead to overvaluing the cost of an energy asset. Furthermore, the minimum exergy-based unit cost of electricity is 14 $/GJ and of cooling is 16 $/GJ. The exergoeconomic factor of the VAR systems is the most affected by the operating variables. From this study, it is concluded that production of cold is not highly cost-effective under the operating conditions studied herein.

AB The cryogenic loop heat pipe is an effective and reliable heat transfer system in the space technology. A global model of cryogenic loop heat pipe is developed by full consideration of the subcooled effect and the mass flow rate variation of the working fluid along the evaporator core. The heat leak is calculated on the basis of onedimensional temperature distributions in the evaporator core. The calculation of the proposed model improves the prediction accuracy relative to traditional zero-dimensional models. The effects of filling pressure, parasitic heat load, auxiliary heat load, and use of bayonet on the CLHP performance are investigated. A normal "U shape" of the evaporating temperature curve appears at a low filling pressure (1.45 MPa). At moderate and high filling pressures (1.465 MPa and 1.5 MPa, respectively), two new evaporating temperature curves with "flat bottom U-shape" and "L-shape", which shows the unique operating characteristics of cryogenic loop heat pipes, are found, The two new profiles are attributed to the coupling of mass and energy between gas reservoir and primary compensation chamber. The determinant factor for the minimum working heat load is the void fraction of the primary compensation chamber. By contrast, the maximum working heat load is determined by the void fraction at a low filling pressure (below 1.4 MPa) and the maximum capillary pressure at a high filling pressure (above 1.4 MPa). The use of a bayonet can decrease the maximum vapor quality in the evaporator core and effectively avoid burnout.

AB The production of aluminum is a low energy-efficient industrial process. In fact, almost half of its energy demand is lost under the form of heat along the production line. For this reason, aluminum producers are interested in improving energy efficiency of their smelters by recovering the thermal losses. It is well known that a significant loss of energy occurs across the sidewalls of the electrolysis cells. This paper proposes a proof of concepts where the sidewall thermal wastes are used to drive Low Temperature Differential (LTD) Stirling engines. To estimate the losses, a heat transfer study is implemented; heat conduction coupled with mixed convection and radiation is evaluated by using the OpenFOAM Computational Fluid Dynamic (CFD) software. Then, a parametric study is performed to analyse cell working conditions under which thermal wastes could be recovered. The heat flux and the temperature of the thermal wastes are used to judge the utilization of possible Stirling engine technologies. Two scenarios are studied: (i) a plane heat collector coupled to the radiative sidewall and (ii) a plane heat collector in direct thermal contact with the cell sidewall. It is demonstrated that the recovery of the wastes by radiation is technically feasible and it does not threaten the safety of the smelter; furthermore, the losses can power some Stirling engines given in the open literature. Therefore, the recovery of the radiative wastes and the further conversion by means of the Stirling engine is an interesting solution to improve the aluminium smelter energy efficiency.

AB Thermoelectric generator is a solid-state energy converter which can convert waste heat directly into electricity. During the past decades, thermoelectric materials have been widely investigated whereas the integrated design of thermoelectric generators have been less studied. This paper proposes and implements a framework for the design of thermoelectric generators, consisting of thermoelectric modules and heat exchangers, based on the Taguchi method. As compared with previous researches which optimize the thermoelectric module alone and assume fixed temperature or fixed heat fluxes for the thermoelectric modules, this work proposes a methodology to optimize the thermoelectric module and the heat exchanger together. Five design parameters (namely the height, the fill-ratio, the ratio of cross-sectional area of n-type material over p-type material of thermoelectric module, the length and the material of the heat exchanger) were analyzed for two different applications, waste heat recovery from marine and automotive engines. In order to perform the analysis, a L-27 (3(5)) orthogonal array was employed to assess all of the design parameters returning the maximum output power. By analysis of variance, it is found that the thermoelectric module height is the most important design parameter contributing for the 69.6% and 30.25% in automotive and marine application, respectively. And the optimal design parameter set are also determined in both applications.

AB Lemon peel oil is one of the renewable and biodegradable biofuel for diesel engine applications due to its low viscous nature. This study aims to observe the performance and emission characteristics of a common rail direct injection diesel engine at various fuel injection strategies under different loading conditions. An open type electronic control unit is used to control the fuel injection timing, injection rate and split injection at various injection pressures. In this research work, 20% lemon peel oil-diesel blend (by volume) is injected at a pressure of 400 bar, 500 bar and 600 bar with 10% pilot injection by volume and the results are compared with diesel fuel at same injection conditions. Further, pilot injection quantity of lemon peel oil blend is varied by 20% and 30% of total volume of fuel injected at 600 bar injection pressure. Finally, the experimental work is carried out in common rail direct injection diesel engine fuelled with lemon peel oil blend under 10% cooled exhaust gas recirculation condition. The study reveals that the brake thermal efficiency is improved with increase in injection pressures and pilot injection rates. However, this trend has been changed during 10% EGR addition for lemon peel oil blend operation at 30% pilot injection rate. The combustion characteristics are improved for lemon peel oil blend for 600 bar injection pressure with 20% and 30% pilot injection rates compared to 10% pilot injection rate. The higher pilot injection rate has shown significant reductions in carbon monoxide, hydrocarbon and smoke emissions. However, the emission results are reversed with 10% exhaust gas recirculation at 600 bar injection pressure of lemon peel oil blend. There is a significant reduction in NOx emission for low injection pressure of lemon peel oil blend at 10% pilot injection rate.

AB The continuing dependence on fossil fuels and the rising energy use in the transport sector have resulted in increased research into viable transport biofuels to mitigate climate change and improve energy security. As transport biofuels now only have a small share of the transport sector energy supply and the complexity in providing the fuels because of issues related to available land and food security, this paper develops conversion path solutions for transport biofuel development based on a technological paradigm study. A data-driven approaches system (DAS) that combines visualization analyses with technological paradigm theory is proposed to reveal the key areas and trends in transport biofuels. Timeline, timezones, and cluster visualizations identified the transport biofuel technological paradigm (TBTP) from current transport biofuel developments; a pre-shift phase (including TBTP competition and TBTP diffusion) and a shift phase (TBTP shift), which respectively relate to conventional biofuels, advanced biofuels, and biofuel cells. However, from further DAS trend analyses and the practical findings, electric energy trends were revealed, indicating that there was a paradigm shift from the biofuel paradigm to a bio-electric energy paradigm. From the developed bio-electric energy framework, both indirect and direct methods were found to have led to an this electric energy conversion to an e-bio fuel cell vehicle for fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEV) and bioelectricity for electric vehicles (EV), both of which can contribute to a low-carbon, sustainable transportation future.

AB Over recent years, combustion engines are effectively equipped with a waste heat recovery (WHR) system to produce power or hydrogen at less additional energy input. The WHR system in this study is partially utilized to heat reforming gas in a methanol steam reformer integrated with a diesel engine and a cooled EGR (Exhaust Gas Recirculation) device to reduce smoke, PM2.5, and NOx emissions. The test items are such as the gas pressure of cylinder, crank angle, diesel consumption rate, hydrogen-rich gas flow rate, air flow rate, and smoke, PM2.5, NOx, HC and CO emissions and the molar analysis of hydrogen-rich gas. The authors analyze how the hydrogen rich gas addition with EGR influences smoke, PM2.5, NOx, HC and CO emissions and combustion performance. The results show that the maximum increase rate of heat recovery efficiency with respect to reaction temperature is 17.5%. The heat recovery efficiency of the reformer rises with increasing engine load up to 24.8%. Adding hydrogen-rich gas with appropriate proportion of EGR helps reduce smoke, PM2.5 and NOx from a diesel engine. In addition, the engine body is rarely changed, and it is effectively to save energy and decrease pollutants.

AB This paper presents a feasibility investigation of integrating an air-based photovoltaic/thermal (PV/T) system with a thermal wheel (TW) system for residential applications. The innovative system is capable of pre-heating/pre-cooling the ambient fresh air in winter/summer as well as producing electricity. The performance of the system is numerically evaluated and compared with the conventional building integrated PV/T (BIPV/T) and TW systems. Then, a multi-objective optimization approach is utilized to find the optimum values of geometric and operating parameters in order to maximize the annual average effectiveness of the TW and the first-law efficiency of the BIPV/T collector. The performances of the optimized and un-optimized BIPV/T-TW systems are compared for a complete year. The results demonstrated that the BIPV/T-TW system has a better thermal performance compared with the BIPV/T and TW systems, while it has a slightly lower electrical performance compared with the BIPV/T system. Furthermore, it was found that the annual average first-law efficiency and TW effectiveness of the optimized BIPV/T-TW system is 118.3% and 59.7% higher than that of the un-optimized system.

AB A stress transfer modeling revealed the stress heterogeneity and its correlation with the seismicity pattern in the bifurcation zone of the Great Sumatran Fault (GSF), where the GSF is divided into two separate sub-parallel segments up to 35 km apart, i.e. Angkola and Barumun, forming a strike-slip duplex at around equator. The analysis was conducted using a seismic catalog compiled from five institutions, i.e. the Indonesian Agency for Meteorology, Climatology, and Geophysics (BMKG), United States Geological Survey USGS), Harvard and Global Centroid Moment Tensor (GCMT), International Seismological Center (ISC), and Geoforschungzentrum (GFZ) Germany, in the period of 1970-2017. Our frequency-magnitude distribution analysis indicates that this zone has a high stress regime. Especially at the tip of the bifurcation zone, in which 20 clockwise rotation of principal stress and 20% increase in stress ratio are observed from the stress inversion. Consequently, events with magnitude larger than 6.0 are concentrated in this area. In addition, our stress transfer modeling reveals the mechanism of the stress heterogeneity at the bifurcation zone and a possible interaction between segment ruptures. Two main internal structures perpendicular to the strike-slip duplex are also observed from the displacement vector. Due to its high stress concentration and its close distance to populous cities of Padang Sidempuan, Bukittinggi, Solok and Padang Panjang in western Sumatra, the tip of GSF bifurcation poses a big potential of seismic hazard. The information of the principal stress rotation and stress ratio obtained in this study can be used further to assess the potential of great ruptures and estimate the possible damage in the study area.

AB The lanthanide tetrad effect and Y-Ho fractionation are commonly observed in highly fractionated melts. In pegmatites, they are attributed to liquid immiscibility, although this explanation has recently been debated. Based on the potential relationship between the lanthanide tetrad effect and liquid immiscibility in pegmatite-forming melts, the rare earth element compositions (REEs, including Y) in three types of zircons from the magmatic stage (Zone II), magmatic-hydrothermal transition stage (Zones III and V) and hydrothermal stage (Zone VI) of the Kelumute No. 112 pegmatite, Chinese Altai, were analyzed by laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) in this study. The results show that the REEs are sharply fractionated from the magmatic stage to the hydrothermal stage. According to the REE variations in the three types of zircons that formed during different stages and the evidence from inclusions, the intense lanthanide tetrad effect and suprachondritic Y/Ho ratios in zircons from Zones III, V and VI result from selective incorporations of REEs in immiscible fluoride melt, which generated the W-type tetrad effect and subchondritic Y/Ho ratios in the fluoride melt and the complementary M-type tetrad effect and suprachondritic Y/Ho ratios in the coexisting silicate melt and aqueous fluid. The results further reflect that the liquid immiscibility of the silicate melt, fluoride melt and aqueous fluid occurred during the magmatic-hydrothermal transition stage of the pegmatite-forming melt. In addition, for the first time, a negative Ce anomaly was identified in the terrestrial zircon from Zone VI of the No. 112 pegmatite; this anomaly is attributed to the preferential incorporation and/or adsorption of Ce in/by the Fe-Mn oxyhydroxides prior to or during the crystallization of zircon in the hydrothermal stage.

   mobile belt from Ongole, India

AB There has been a longstanding and scientifically contentious issue, concerning whether or not the Eastern Ghats mobile belt (EGMB) extends southward beyond Ongole in the state of Andhra Pradesh, in south India. Various geological and geophysical investigations carried out in different campaigns could not conclusively address this important issue. Some argued that the EGMB that originates near Mahanadi in the northeast of India and extends along the eastern continental boundary, is abruptly cut near Ongole in the south, swerves eastward towards the Bay of Bengal and joins the erstwhile east Antarctica boundary. Others opined differently and debated about its southward extension beyond Ongole. In the present study, we provide a conclusive evidence for the first time on this perplexing issue, by determining the deep earth electrical resistivity structure of the EGMB region through broad-band magnetotelluric (MT) investigations carried out along two different profiles laid out one near the Ongole region (profile AA' of 35 km length) and the other near the Nellore region (profile BB' of 52 km length). The latter is located at a distance of about 125 km south of the former. The lengths of both these profiles are sufficiently far from the influences of the electrical nature of the subsurface of the adjoining geological terrains namely, the east Dharwar craton, the Cuddappah basin and the southern granulite terrain. This enables to determine the electrical nature of the EGMB alone and examine whether or not it extends south of Ongole. Two-dimensional inversion of MT data of both the profiles revealed a very thin top conductive layer of about 1-10 Omega-m with an average thickness of about 500 m, representing the alluvium. This layer is underlain by very high resistive subsurface with resistivity of about 10(7) Q-m extending up to about 30 km and probably further beyond (not shown in the present study). Since the major rock types in the study area, namely, Khondalites, Calcgranulites, Charnockites and Granitic gneisses of Archaean age, have large overlapping resistivities, MT data could not explicitly discern the nature of the multilayered crust beneath the EGMB. As a result, the subsurface beneath both the regions shows up as a very thick single layer of very high resistivity. The high grade rocks of the Ongole domain and supracrustals of Nellore Schist Belt (NSB), which lies south of Ongole domain, have undergone synchronous tectonic activity at ca.1.6 By. This is evident by the Kanigiri and Kandra ophiolites within NSB that signify the Proterozoic subduction of the EGMB. This geological evidence together with the similar nature of the high electrical resistivity of the subsurface observed at Ongole and Nellore regions confirm the southward extension of the EGMB beyond Ongole.

AB The Longmenshan Tectonic Complex (LSTC), along the eastern margin of the Tibetan Plateau, the site of devastating earthquakes such as the magnitude 8.0 (Wenchuan) earthquake on 12 May 2008, preserves an exceptionally complete history of the tectonic evolution of the Yangtze block and its relations to adjacent tectonic units. Due to sequential tectonic superposition and tectonic reactivation, the tectonic nature of the LSTC, and in particularly the older history, has been profoundly debated and many different tectonic models have been proposed. Herein we summarize the current understandings of the major tectonic events that have shaped this important tectonic complex, highlighting problems left to be solved by future work, including:
   (1) The nature and constraints for at least 6 regional tectonic events, i.e., building of the metamorphic basement (Ar-t), the Columbia/Nuna supercontinent (Pt-1t), the Rodinia supercontinent (Pt-3t), the Paleozoic passive continental margin (Pz(t)), the Paleotethys orogeny (Mz(t)) and the Neotethys orogeny (Kz(t)); (2) Metamorphic basement exposures and their tectonic implications, including rock types and geochronological constraints for the Archean, Paleoproterozoic and Neoproterozoic basements; (3) Nature of the present LSTC and its affinity with adjacent tectonic units; (4) Consideration of the NE-striking Longmenshan thrust belt and arcuate-shape Yanyuan-Muli thrust belt as parts of a single tectonic feature; (5) Mountain-basin coupled systems recording past tectonic eposides. We draw the following conclusions and tectonic models based on published research combined with our own recent studies: (1) The well preserved Archean Yudongzi gneiss group in the LSTC has a genetic affinity with the Kongling group, and thus belongs to the Yangtze block; (2) The Paleoproterozoic Hejiayan group, juxtaposed adjacent to the Archean Yudongzi group, may represent a 2000-1800 Ma orogenic belt, which corresponds to the supercontinent Nuna/Columbia amalgamation event; (3) A Neoproterozoic trench-arc-basin system, which is reconstructed based on identification of a Neoproterozoic ophiolite complex, arc-type magmatic rock assemblages and volcaniclastic basinal deposits along the western margin of the Yangtze block and the LSTC, may represent the record of eastward subduction of the Neoproterozoic Mozambique oceanic lithosphere beneath the Yangtze block during the assembly of the Rodinia supercontinent; (4) A complete bidirectional Wilson cycle was reconstructed by the formation of the late Permian to the middle-late Triassic back-arc Ganze-Litang rift and ocean following the early Paleozoic Mianlue continental rift and ocean, and subsequent closure of the ocean basin by simultaneous bidirectional northward and southwestward subduction and later collision. This relatively uncommon bidirectional Wilson cycle might be attributed to the formation of the three-armed rift system in the eastern Paleotethys associated with the late Permian Eemeishan Large Igneous Province in the LSTC; (5) A three-stage tectonic sequence of, in-sequence imbricate thrust in the LSTC during India-Eurasian collisional orogeny at 55-15 Ma, extrusion from 15 to 5 Ma and the plateau uplift since similar to 5 Ma resulting from lower crustal channel flow, is proposed for the formation of the present LSTC.

AB Liaodong Peninsula on the northeastern North China Block that witnessed the spectacular Late Mesozoic tectonics is a key area to probe the transition from compression to extension. Borehole data clearly reveals that the Cambrian limestone overlay the Jurassic limestone, which identified the Yuantai thrust system in Liaodong Peninsula. Zircon grains from a granodiorite dike that intruded the thrust system yielded U-Pb age of 128.3 +/- 1.3 Ma, further constraining the timing of the thrusting between Late Jurassic to early Early Cretaceous. A detailed field study of three-dimensional fault-zone exposures in the Zhayao tectonic window are conducted to decipher the thrust tectonics before the extension in Liaodong Peninsula. The key observations are: (1) meter-scale asymmetric folds in deformed mid-Cambrian rocks; (2) decameter-scale recumbent folds and secondary imbricate thrusts in deformed Middle Jurassic rocks; and (3) non-foliated breccia, fault gouge, and brittle porphyroclasts adjacent to fault planes. The combined brittle ductile style of deformation indicates that the fault zone operated under near-surface conditions. In addition, we infer that the folds were formed first at the propagating fault tip and subsequently dismembered by normal faults. We interpret the Zhayao thrust, which is located around the margin of the tectonic window, as the frontal thrust of the Yuantai thrust system. Furthermore, by applying the theory of fault-related folds, we deduce that the Zhayao frontal thrust is a secondary duplex. Based on our field observations and borehole data, we propose an imbricate thrust model for the fold-and-thrust belt of the southern Liaodong Peninsula. The structural data indicate that the transport direction of the Yuantai thrust system was top-to-the-southeast, suggesting that the thrust system was resulted due to northwest-ward subduction of the paleo-Pacific plate during the Mesozoic.

AB The collision between the North China and Yangtze Cratons in the Middle Triassic (240-225 Ma) created the world's largest ultrahigh-pressure (UHP) metamorphic belt (the Dabie-Sulu Orogen). The peridotitic massifs in this belt, including those derived from a lithospheric mantle (M-type) and from previous cumulates in continental crust (C-type), and mantle xenoliths captured by the Xinyang (Henan Province) Jurassic (similar to 160 Ma) volcanics at the southern edge of the North China Craton, are the ideal targets to investigate the crust-mantle interaction and the destruction of the North China Craton. The M-type peridotitic massifs, including those in the Zhimafang (CCSD-pp1), Xugou, Hujialing, Chijiadian and Yangkou areas in the Sulu belt and Raobazhai area in the Dabie belt, have high whole-rock Mg# (89-93) and high contents of hydrous minerals (e.g., phlogopite and Ti-clinohumite). Peridotitic xenoliths in the Xinyang volcanics have olivine Mg# (90-93) similar to the M-type peridotitic massifs, suggesting that the massifs have an affinity to the lithospheric mantle beneath the North China Craton. The peridotites of the Dabie-Sulu orogen and Xinyang may be affected by carbonate metasomatism while minor differences may be related to the complex UHP metamorphism. Both the xenoliths and the M-type peridotites have similar zircon U-Pb ages of Proterozoic and Phanerozoic. The Phanerozoic ages are mainly Early Mesozoic (similar to 230 Ma), reflecting the major metasomatic effects from the subduction/collision of the Yangtze Craton beneath the North China Craton; a few Early Paleozoic (similar to 470 Ma) zircons may results from the metasomatism due to the Paleo-Tethyan slab subduction. The geochemical and U-Pb ages similarities between the M-type peridotitic massifs and the xenoliths indicate that the modification of the marginal lithospheric mantle of the North China Craton was mainly initiated by the chemical (addition of fluids/melts from the subducted Yangtze continental crust) and the mechanical processes (crust and tectonic compression and extension) during the Triassic collision.

AB Permian-Triassic magmatic rocks are widely exposed in different tectonic terranes and continental blocks in the Aegean region. This study is focussed on the Istanbul Zone and the Istranca (Strandja) Massif, which are located in the Western Pontides of NW Turkey. The Kirklareli and the Tepecik plutons intruded into the metamorphic basement rocks of the Istranca Massif, and the Sancaktepe pluton is emplaced into the Istanbul Paleozoic sedimentary sequences. We present new geochemical data for these plutons, in order to interpret their petrogenesis and time of emplacement and use this information for geodynamic interpretation. The zircon U-Pb crystallization ages are 268.3 +/- 2.1 Ma for the Kirklareli pluton, 249.4 +/- 1.5 Ma for the Tepecik pluton and 257.3 +/- 1.5 Ma and 253.7 +/- 1.75 Ma for the the Sancaktepe pluton. They are high-K, talc-alkaline to shoshonitic granitoids with aluminum saturation index (ASI) values between 0.9 and 1.3, which define them as peraluminous and slightly metaluminous. Sr-87/Sr-86((i))) values for the studied plutons range between 0.701123 and 0.707704. Nd-143/Nd-144((i))) ratios calculated for crystallization ages are between 0.512052 and 0.512431, and epsilon Nd-(i)) values vary from -4.71 to 2.22. T-DM model ages range between 0.83 and 1.41 Ga. These plutons are enriched in LILEs and LREE and depleted in HFSEs with negative Eu anomalies, indicating that the melts were derived from mafic crustal sources. Our new data suggest that the Kirklareli pluton was generated in a subduction-related magmatic arc, and the highly fractionated Sancaktepe and Tepecik plutons were formed in a back-arc setting in response to the northward subduction of the Paleo-Tethys Ocean during the Mid Permian-Early Triassic.

AB During the Carnian, the Hanwang area in the northwestern Sichuan Basin (South China) was characterized by shallow water carbonate sedimentation that underwent an abrupt demise associated to a sudden input of terrigenous sediments. This major facies change was considered to be the expression of the onset of the Carnian Humid Episode, a most remarkable environmental crisis in Late Triassic that is well recognized in northwestern Tethys margins and coincides with a major global perturbation of the carbon stable isotope record. However, the lack of detailed biostratigraphic constraints have so far prevented a precise dating of the carbonate platform demise in western Sichuan Basin.
   In this work, the Qingyan Gou (HWQ) section, cropping out in Hanwang, was investigated for its facies and microfacies, carbonate carbon and oxygen isotopes on brachiopods, microbial grains and bulk matrix. Facies analysis shows a marine transgression from inner ramp oolitic shoal to middle ramp siliceous sponge mound, then overlain by shale and calcareous siltstone with interbedded silty mudstones. Refined biostratigraphic data from HWQ and Guanyin Ya (HWG) sections imply that the demise of sponge mounds occur in the late Tuvalian or later.
   A negative carbon isotope perturbation was found in the bulk matrix immediately below the sponge mounds demise, but it was not found on the isotope record from brachiopods. This suggests that the negative shift in the bulk carbonate was probably related to diagenesis. Given the late Tuvalian (last substage of Carnian) age attributed to the demise of the sponge mounds and the absence of a carbon isotopic excursion, we infer that the carbonate platform crisis and strong terrigenous input in Hanwang cannot be related to the onset of the Carnian Humid Episode. These the demise of the carbonate platform and the facies deepening trend could be rather due to the interplay between accelerating subsidence rates, environmental chants and enhanced siliciclastic input related to the formation of a foreland basin during Indosinian orogenesis.

AB In the central part of the Zagros fold-and-thrust belt of Iran, several diapirs of the Latest Precambrian-Early Cambrian Hormuz Salt locally decorate the surface exposures of a series of N-S to NNW-SSE trending right lateral tear fault systems. The Karebas Fault System (KBFS), as one of these fault systems, is associated with five salt diapirs. There are also several NW-SE trending anticlines, which are either cross-cut by the fault system or terminated against it and the adjacent salt diapirs. The Neogene Zagros folds are clearly affected by the surface expression of the Karebas Fault System, suggesting that the fault system is coeval with or post-dates the Neogene deformation. On the contrary, halokinesis as old as at least Late Jurassic is documented by near-diapir strati graphic exposures, indicating pre-orogenic existence of the diapirs. Although the lack of older rock outcrops precludes tracking the pre-Jurassic records of diapirism, the geometry of strata, which flank these diapirs, indicates long-term pre-folding salt rise driven by downbuilding of lateral minibasins and progressive draping of sedimentary layers over the flanks of the rising diapirs. Therefore, presence of old salt structures along the young (Neogene) tear fault system suggests an important role played by the presence of early-formed salt structures in inducing later strike-slip deformation along zones of preferential weakness, which was prepared by the pre-folding salt structures and thinner sedimentary pile overlying them. Salt diapirs and related changes in strati graphic thicknesses (i.e. minibasins) also effectively grappled with the process of folding. Detachment folding is typically the main structural style across the area, and was mainly developed above the Hormuz Salt as the basal decollement and partly by involvement of the intermediate detachment levels. However, preferential weakness and squeezing of the diapirs on one hand and greater strength of the minibasins on the other hand gave rise to further complexities of deformation during shortening. Such first-order controls could led to perturbations, at the scale of diapirs and minibasins, in the stress pattern as the southwestward-advancing front of the Zagros deformation migrated across the stratigraphic section and the salt structures. It occurred because strain is localized at the diapirs and squeezes them whereas tends to avoid folding the thick, and hence stronger, minibasins into anticlines. In such a context, the localization and the longitudinal propagation of the folds in the cover sequence could be remarkably influenced and irregular. The consequence was variable fold geometries (location and dimension) and fold-axes rotations with respect to the diapirs and minibasins.

AB The Sichuan Basin is among the basins with the most abundant oil and gas resources in China. The Sinian and Cambrian strata are the most important source rocks. Previous studies of the thermal history of the central Sichuan Basin have focused on the Late Paleozoic and studies of the Early Paleozoic thermal history are not available in literature and the thermal evolution of the Sinian and Cambrian source rocks are yet to be examined. A new thermal history was reconstructed using integrated thermal indicators, including apatite and zircon (U-Th)/He, zircon fission tracks, and equivalent vitrinite reflectance. The modeled results indicated that the heat flow was relatively low (< 65 mW/m(2)) from the Sinian to Early Permian. During the Middle-Late Permian, the heat flow reached a maximum value (75-100 mW/m(2)) which may have been controlled by the heating effect of the Emeishan mantle plume and crustal extension. Following the Triassic, the heat flow gradually decreased to its present value of 60-70 mW/m(2). The maturity histories of the source rocks, modeled based on the new thermal histories, indicate that the Sinian and Cambrian source rocks were slowly maturing during the Early Paleozoic, underwent rapid maturation during the Mesozoic, and reached the dry-gas stage during the Late Cretaceous. These new data on the thermal history and source rock maturity histories of the central Sichuan Basin provide new insights to guide oil and gas exploration of the basin.

AB The closure of the Paleotethys ocean in the Tethyan orogenic belt in northeastern (NE) Iran, related to the collision between Gondwana-derived terranes in the south and Laurasia in the north, remains controversial due to the sparsity of Paleozoic ophiolitic outcrops but can be constrained by contemporaneous granitoids. The Late Triassic Torbat e Jam stock in NE Iran is composed of three intrusive suites: (1) the oldest gabbro to quartz diorite intruded at 215.5 +/- 0.9 Ma; (2) granodiorite to monzonite; and (3) the youngest granite to alkali granite. All three suites are metaluminous to moderately peraluminous with enrichment in LILE, low LREE/HREE fractionation with (La/Yb)(N) = 8.4-116, and small negative Eu anomalies. The Torbat e Jam stock without primary magnetite is characterized by very low magnetic susceptibility (5 x 10(-5) to 6 x 10(-4) SI unit), indicative of the I-type granitoids. Zircon Hf isotopic compositions show positive epsilon Hf-(t) values of + 2.6 to + 5.7, indicative of a predominantly mantle source with minor crustal contamination. Hf model ages are consistent with the presence of Neoproterozoic juvenile sources (T-DMC = 0.88 to 1.09 Ga). These geochemical data and field relationships suggest that the Torbat e Jam stock formed in a late orogenic to post-collisional tectonic setting after the closure of a secondary Paleotethys ocean (Paleotethys II), which opened as an oceanic trough during the Late Palaeozoic in the Iranian block, and closed in the Late Permian-Early Triassic Indosinian orogeny.

AB The Sepon gold-copper district occurs along the Truong Son Foldbelt in a 10 km x 40 km east-trending corridor in southern Laos. This study has investigated the nature of gold in pyrite and ore-forming fluid characteristics using Laser Ablation Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) and Proton Induced X-ray Emission (PIXE) techniques. Gold is present as invisible gold (Au+1) and as nanoparticles of gold (Au-0) in both sedimentary-rock hosted gold and skarn Cu-Au deposits. Gold is present in an early syngenetic pyrite generation (pyrite 2B) with concentrations to 0.5 ppm. Post-sedimentation processes included formation of quartz veins which host pyrite 3B with concentrations to 1.8 ppm Au. The highest concentrations of gold were found in the rims of hydrothermal vein-hosted pyrite 4A and in skarn related pyrite, suggesting gold concentration at a later stage during the ore-forming processes and not during sedimentation.
   As rhyodacite-porphyry is proximal to calcareous shale and dolomite that host ores, it is plausible that the emplacement of rhyodacite-porphyry introduced significant amount of hydrothermal fluids that circulated through fractures and favoured high grade (to 293 ppm Au) in pyrite 4A and pyrite SKN2. Gold is preferentially concentrated in As-rich zones and in areas that underwent brittle deformation, as evidenced by fracture-fill coarse-grained pyrite 4A, indicating a structural control to ore formation. The predominance of Se, Bi and Te in pyrite SKN1 and the elevated concentrations of Bi, Cu, Se, Sn and Mo in pyrite SKN2 raise the possibility of derivation from a magmatic source. The presence of primary hematite associated with the skarn suggests prevailing oxidising fluid conditions during Au mineralisation in pyrite SKN2. There is a striking chemical similarity between pyrite 4A core and py-SKN1 and rimmed zones of pyrite 4A and pyrite SKN2, which indicates possibility of two types of hydrothermal fluids. The As-rich fluids with elevated concentrations of Au, Se, Sb, Tl, and Cu recorded in pyrite 4A rims and pyrite SKN2. The As-poor fluids with elevated concentrations of Ni and Pb yielded in pyrite 4A cores and pyrite SKN1. The chemistry of pyrite has also shown that both ore-forming fluids are undersaturated in Au similar to Au-bearing pyrite in the Carlin-type deposits, Nevada, USA.

AB NW Iran is among the most interesting and complex areas within Arabian-Eurasia collision zone. Historical and instrumental earthquake records in this region indicate that active faults have the potential to produce serious seismic hazards in the future. The North Bozgush Fault Zone, an anastomosing fault zone, consists of several parallel and sub-parallel faults which have developed in a right lateral strike-slip system with a reverse component. Our structural analysis shows that faulting occurs along a strong dominant compressional strike-slip regime and is predominantly related to NW-SE shortening along the zone.
   This paper represents an analysis of the morphometric indices to depict the tectonic activity of the northern part of the Bozgush Mountains, an area with a typical tectono-morphology. The result of the morphometric analysis shows that relative tectonic activity along the North Bozgush Fault Zone decreases significantly from west to east. Measured uplift rates show that the uplift rate is higher than 0.5 mm/yr in the western and central parts and decreases in the eastern part to between 0.5 and 0.05 mm/yr. The structural and morphometric data are indicative of the relation between the North Bozgush Fault Zone and the Tabriz Fault Zone during Quaternary time.

AB Craton's thermal state is one of the main gateways to understand the craton dynamics. Three cratons in China, the Tarim, North China, and Yangtze cratons, are in different thermal states and differ in their stabilities. Low heat flow usually corresponds to stable craton but not vice versa. The Tarim Craton is cold (similar to 44 mW/m(2)) and still keeps its stability now. The western North China Craton and the upper Yangtze Craton are not too cold (50-60 mW/m(2)) but also remain stable. The eastern North China Craton and the Middle-Lower Yangtze Craton are relatively hot with heat flow of 60-70 mW/m(2), both have been heated and destroyed in the Mesozoic. All these cratons have experienced complex tectonothermal events since their formation. Some tectonothermal events only thin and heat craton but others can destroy craton. Several sedimentary basins are developed in these cratons, which recorded individual thermal histories. These thermal records could help to understand the thermal evolution of these cratons and provide constraints on craton dynamics including stability or destruction. The thermal results indicate parts of craton in western China (Tarim and Sichuan) have secular cooling histories, which were locally disturbed by mantle plume activities in the Permian. The Middle-Lower Yangtze Craton has undergone similar thermal evolution as the eastern North China Craton. All parts of cratons in eastern China might all have been destroyed due to subduction and dehydration of the Pacific Plate during the Mesozoic.

AB Mafic-intermediate igneous rocks in the Bangxi-Chenxing tectonic zone of Hainan Island, South China, can be used to constrain the Paleotethyan tectonic evolution in Southeast Asia. This paper presents petrologic, geochronological, elemental and Sr-Nd-Hf-O isotopic data for Carboniferous basalts, Permian andesites and Triassic gabbro-dolerites in this zone. Zircon grains from these rocks have U-Pb ages of similar to 330 Ma, similar to 257 Ma and similar to 240 Ma, respectively. The similar to 330 Ma basalts contain 1400 Ma captured zircon grains, and display MORB-like geochemical characteristics with positive epsilon(Nd) (t) values of +5.86-+9.85, reflective of a MORB source with the input of a slab-derived component in a continental back-arc basin setting. The similar to 257 Ma andesites contain older captured zircon grains, and have arc-like geochemical signature with weakly positive epsilon(Nd) (t) values of +0.26-+0.38, zircon epsilon(Hf) (t) values of -0.5-+1.4 and delta O-18 values of 6.35-7.16 parts per thousand, which were derived from a metasomatized mantle wedge modified by the sediment-derived component in a continental arc setting. The similar to 240 Ma gabbro-dolerites exhibit enrichment in LILFs, depletion in HFSEs, negative eNd (t)-epsilon(Hf) (t) values (-8.45 to -1.05 and -5.9 to -2.7, respectively) and crustal-like delta O-18 values (7.26-8.70 parts per thousand), indicative of a post-collisional environment in response to the asthenosphere upwelling shortly after the closure of the Bangxi-Chenxing back-arc basin. The Carboniferous-Triassic mafic-intermediate igneous rocks thus record the Carboniferous-Permian arc-basin system and its Triassic closure. The Bangxi-Chenxing tectonic zone separated South Hainan from North Hainan and westerly extended to the Song Ma-Ailaoshan suture zone.

AB The geothermal provinces of the western Red Sea coast and East African countries have evolved synchronous with the evolution of the landmasses around the Red Sea. The Red Sea opening was initiated subsequent to the opening of the Aden Gulf that was triggered by the Afar plume. During the Late Oligocene, the Red Sea rift started extending from south towards north culminating into a failed arm near the Suez Gulf. The geothermal systems evolved due to shallow mantle below the Danakil depression and circulating seawater. Besides the volcanic flows, the regional sedimentary aquifers like the Wajid Sandstone and Amron limestone, that occur in Ethiopia, Egypt, Eritrea and Djibouti, that were deposited prior to the younger tectonic events that started at 31 Ma are the main geothermal reservoirs in these countries. In contrast, rain surface and evaporated lake water are the main sources for the Kenyan geothermal systems. Although these geothermal fluids show variation in their chemical components due to different recharging sources, all the geothermal systems are of high temperature, capable of generating electricity.

TI Formation and evolution of the Chain-Kairali Escarpment and the Vishnu
   Fracture Zone in the Western Indian Ocean

AB Published models for the plate tectonic evolution of the Western Indian Ocean suggest that the Southern Mascarene Basin opened by oceanic crustal accretion between the continental margins of southwestern India and southeastern Madagascar. However, with the cessation of the Mascarene Basin spreading centre followed by a ridge jump resulting in the opening of the Carlsberg Ridge, almost all the traces of India-Madagascar divergence were carved away from the Indian Plate and attached to the African Plate. According to some recent studies, the Chain-Kairali Escarpment, a prominent feature on the southwestern continental margin of India, is possibly the only trace of India-Madagascar divergence that remained on the Indian Plate. But the exact conjugate correspondence of this feature on the Madagascar side is uncertain. Published plate tectonic reconstructions imply that the Vishnu Fracture Zone on the Indian side and the Mauritius Fracture Zone on the Madagascar side are aligned at chron C22ny (similar to 49.04 Ma). Based on the near collinearity of gravity anomaly trends, the Chain-Kairali Escarpment appears to be the landward extension of the Vishnu FZ. However, at chron C34ny (similar to 83.0 Ma), the Chain-Kairali Escarpment was in close proximity to the incipient Mahanoro Fracture Zone. In this study we investigate this incompatibility, using an up-to-date compilation of the tectonic elements from the conjugate regions of India and Madagascar and the latest available rotation parameters that describe India-Madagascar separation through a direct India-Seychelles-Madagascar plate circuit. Our revised plate reconstruction model suggests that the Chain-Kairali Escarpment was formed due to the strike-slip motion between the southeast coast of Madagascar and the then southwest coast of India during the initial stages of India-Madagascar breakup. The migration of the Chain-Kairali Escarpment from the proximity of the Mahanoro FZ and aligning with the Vishnu FZ was the result of several successive events. The first among those events was asymmetric crustal accretion in the Mascarene Basin due to ridge propagation, between chrons C34ny (83.0 Ma) to C33ny (similar to 73.62 Ma). The Chain-Kairali Escarpment and associated crustal weak zones offshore India appear to have facilitated subsequent initiation of the Mauritius FZ and its conjugate Vishnu FZ during a plate reorganization at about chron C33ny (similar to 73.62 Ma). The cessation of spreading in the Mascarene Basin and development of full extent of the Carlsberg Ridge, shortly after chron C27ny (60.92 Ma), resulted in the initiation of a long transform fault, coinciding with the Vishnu FZ, which connected the Carlsberg Ridge with the spreading centre of the Madagascar Basin. Therefore, the Vishnu FZ and the Chain-Kairali Escarpment are two independent features created during different episodes of evolution of the Western Indian Ocean and the Chain-Kairali Escarpment is not a landward extension of the Vishnu FZ.

TI Rhyolites in the Emeishan large igneous province (SW China) with

   PROVINCE; VOLCANIC-ROCKS; TRACE-ELEMENT; GEOCHEMICAL EVIDENCE
AB In the Emeishan Large Igneous Province (ELIP), western Yangtze Block, SW China, minor amounts of silicic volcanic rocks (similar to 5%) are spatially and temporally associated with flood basalts. The distribution and origin of these silicic rocks are keys to understanding the processes associated with mantle plume activities. In the Binchuan and Panzhihua areas, southwestern ELIP, there are Nb-Ta-poor and Nb-Ta-rich rhyolites. Nb-Ta-poor rhyolites interlayered with basalts in the Binchuan area occur in the lower part of the Emeishan volcanic sequence and have a crustal origin. They are characterized by negative Nb-Ta anomalies, low epsilon(Nd)(t) and high Sr-87/Sr-86(i) values, and zircon saturation temperatures (836-852 degrees C). Nb-Ta-rich rhyolites are associated with the main phase of the Emeishan volcanic sequence in the Binchuan and Panzhihua areas and are characterized by positive Nb-Ta anomalies, oceanic island basalt (OM-like trace element ratios, low Sr-87/Sr-86(i) ratios, positive em(t) and epsilon(Hf)(t) values, and high A/CNK ratios and Fe*s. In addition, they have high Ga/Al ratios, high field strength elements (HFSEs), and high zircon saturation temperatures (> 920 degrees C), typical of aluminous A-type silicic rocks, similar to the spatially distributed syenitic intrusions of the ELIP. These Nb-Ta-rich rhyolites are best interpreted as hybrid products of crystal fractionation of high-Ti basaltic magmas, coupled with minor crustal assimilation (6-14%), on the basis of Rhyolite-MELTS and EC-AFC simulations. The temporal and spatial distributions of these two types of rhyolite reflect various extents of thermal and mass exchange between mantle-derived basaltic magma and crustal material above a mantle plume. When the plume head reached the base of the western Yangtze Block, enriched components in the lithospheric mantle were melted and the melts partially ponded near the crust-mantle boundary or in the lower crust where they induced partial melting of crustal materials to form Nb-Ta-poor rhyolites. During the main phase of volcanism, large magma chambers and extensive plumbing systems developed due to decompressional melting of the mantle plume. In this stage, abundant mafic-ultramafic and felsic intrusions were formed, and Nb-Ta-rich rhyolites and A-type granites were emplaced.

AB To better understand the evolution of the North Qaidam orogen, eclogite that forms lens-like bodies in granitic gneiss was studied in the Luliangshan terrane, North Qaidam ultrahigh-pressure (UHP) metamorphic belt. Petrographic and mineralogical studies as well as pressure-temperature calculations showed that the eclogite underwent at least three metamorphic stages. Peak eclogite-facies metamorphism at 647-768 degrees C and a >= 3.0 GPa was followed by high-pressure (HP) granulite-facies metamorphism at 815-929 degrees C/1.61-1.75 GPa and cooling to amphibolite-facies metamorphism at 606-720 degrees C/0.41-0.56 GPa. Three age groups can be identified via LA-ICP-MS zircon U-Pb eclogite dating: (1) an eclogite-facies metamorphic age of ca. 432-428 Ma, (2) an HP granulite-facies retrograde age of ca. 424-420 Ma, and (3) ages of 415-382 Ma, which constrained the timing of amphibolite-facies metamorphism. The studied eclogite is characterized by high field strength element enrichment, particularly in Nb content (57.8-124 ppm) and flat rare earth element patterns similar to high Nb island arc basalts described in many modern arcs that feature subduction of oceanic slabs. The samples have positive epsilon(Nd)(t) values (+2.1 to +5.1) and positive epsilon(Hf)(t) values (+4.9 to +10.0), indicating that the protolith of the high Nb eclogite was directly derived from the depleted mantle with little crustal contamination. These island arc basalts have been interpreted to have arisen from the partial melting of mantle wedge garnet-amphibole or garnet peridotite metasomatized by slab-dehydrated melts of a subducted oceanic slab. They were emplaced onto the continental block by arc magmatism prior to the main collision event. Then, the island arc materials were dragged into the subduction channel with eclogite-facies metamorphism via subduction of the Qaidam Block.

AB In the field of nanomedicine, nanoparticles are developed to target antibiotics to sites of bacterial infection thus enabling adequate drug exposure and decrease development of resistant bacteria. In the present study, we investigated the encapsulation of two antibiotics with different polarity into different PEGylated polymeric nanoparticles based on aliphatic polyesters, to obtain a better understanding of critical factors determining encapsulation and release. The nanoparticles were prepared from diblock copolymers comprising of a poly (ethylene glycol) block attached to an aliphatic polyester block of varying polarity: poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (mPEG-PLGA), poly(lactic-co-hydroxymethyl glycolic acid) (mPEG-PLHMGA) and poly(lactic-co-benzyloxymethyl glycolic acid) (mPEG-PLBMGA). Hydrophobic bedaquiline and hydrophilic vancomycin were encapsulated via single and double-emulsion solvent evaporation techniques, respectively. Encapsulation, degradation and release studies at physiological simulating conditions were performed. Drug polarity and preparation techniques influenced encapsulation efficiency into polymer nanoparticles, giving almost complete encapsulation of bedaquiline and approx. 30% for vancomycin independent of the polymer type. The nonpolar bedaquiline showed a predominantly diffusion-controlled release independent of polymer composition. However, polar vancomycin was released by a combination of diffusion and polymer degradation, which was significantly affected by polymer composition, the most hydrophilic polymer displaying the fastest release.

The purpose of this study was to design lipid-polymer hybrid nanoparticles (LPNs) loaded with the corticosteroid, budesonide, which could potentially be combined with small interfering RNA (siRNA) for COPD management. Here, we prepared LPNs based on the biodegradable polymer poly(DLlactic- co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) and the cationic lipid dioleyltrimethylammonium propane (DOTAP) using a double emulsion solvent evaporation method. A quality-by-design (QbD) approach was adopted to define the optimal formulation parameters. The quality target product profile (QTPP) of the LPNs was identified based on risk assessment. Two critical formulation parameters (CFPs) were identified, including the theoretical budesonide loading and the theoretical DOTAP loading. The CFPs were linked to critical quality attributes (CQAs), which included the intensity-based hydrodynamic particle diameter (z-average), the polydispersity index (PDI), the zeta-potential, the budesonide encapsulation efficiency, the actual budesonide loading and the DOTAP encapsulation efficiency. A response surface methodology (RSM) was applied for the experimental design to evaluate the influence of the CFPs on the CQAs, and to identify the optimal operation space (OOS). All nanoparticle dispersions displayed monodisperse size distributions (PDI < 0.2) with z-averages of approximately 150 nm, suggesting that the size is not dependent on the investigated CFPs. In contrast, the zeta-potential was highly dependent on the theoretical DOTAP loading. Upon increased DOTAP loading, the zeta-potential reached a maximal point, after which it remained stable at the maximum value. This suggests that the LPN surface is covered by DOTAP, and that the DOTAP loading is saturable. The actual budesonide loading of the LPNs was mainly dependent on the initial amount of budesonide, and a clear positive effect was observed, which shows that the interaction between drug and PLGA increases when increasing the initial amount of budesonide. The OOS was modeled by applying the QTPP. The OOS had a budesonide encapsulation efficiency higher than 30%, a budesonide loading above 15 mu g budesonide/mg PLGA, a zeta-potential higher than 35 mV and a DOTAP encapsulation efficiency above 50%. This study shows the importance of systematic formulation design for understanding the effect of formulation parameters on the characteristics of LPNs, eventually resulting in the identification of an OOS.

AB Dactolisib (NVP-BEZ235, also referred to as: 'BEZ235' or 'BEZ') is a dual mTOR/PI3 K inhibitor that is of potential interest in the treatment of inflammatory disorders. This work focuses on formulation of BEZ-loaded polymeric nanoparticles composed of a blend of poly(D, L-lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) and poly(D, L-lactide-coglycolide)- poly(ethylene glycol)-2000 (PLGA-PEG). The nanoparticles were prepared by an oil/water emulsion solvent evaporation method, and were subsequently characterized for yield, encapsulation efficiency, morphology, particle size, drug-polymer interaction and in vitro drug release profiles. A targeted formulation was developed by conjugation of a S-acetyl-thioacetyl (SATA)-modified mouse-anti human E-selectin antibody to the distal end of PLGA-PEG-SPDP containing nanoparticles. Our results show the successful preparation of spherical PLGA/PLGA-PEG nanoparticles loaded with BEZ. The particle size distribution showed a range from 250 to 360 nm with a high (> 75%) BEZ encapsulation efficiency. Approximately 35% of the loaded BEZ was released within 10 days at 37 degrees C in a medium containing 5% bovine serum albumin (BSA). Evaluation of efficacy of anti E-selectin decorated BEZ-loaded nanoparticles was carried out in tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) activated endothelial cells. Confocal microscopy analysis showed that cellular uptake of the targeted nanoparticles and subsequent internalization. Cell functional assays, including migration assay and phosphowestern blot analysis of the mTOR and pI3K signaling pathways, revealed that the E-selectin targeted nanoparticles loaded with BEZ had a pronounced effect on inflammation-activated endothelial cells as compared to the non-targeted BEZloaded nanoparticles. In conclusion, E-selectin targeted nanoparticles have a high potential in delivering the potent mTOR/pI3K inhibitor dactolisib to inflamed endothelial cells and are an interesting nanomedicine for anti-inflammatory therapy.

AB Activated endothelial cells play a pivotal role in the pathology of inflammatory disorders and thus present a target for therapeutic intervention by drugs that intervene in inflammatory signaling cascades, such as rapamycin (mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor). In this study we developed anti-E-selectin immunoliposomes for targeted delivery to E-selectin over-expressing tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) activated endothelial cells. Liposomes composed of 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3.; hosphocholine (DPPC), Cholesterol, and 1,2-Distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine-N-[methoxy(polyethyleneglycol)-2000]-maleimide (DSPE-PEG- Mal) were loaded with rapamycin via lipid film hydration, after which they were further functionalized by coupling N-succinimidyl-S-acetylthioacetate (SATA)-modified mouse anti human E-selectin antibodies to the distal ends of the maleimidyl (Mal)-PEG groups. In cell binding assays, these immunoliposomes bound specifically to TNF-alpha activated endothelial cells. Upon internalization, rapamycin loaded immunoliposomes inhibited proliferation and migration of endothelial cells, as well as expression of inflammatory mediators. Our findings demonstrate that rapamycin-loaded immunoliposomes can specifically inhibit inflammatory responses in inflamed endothelial cells.

AB Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are nanosized vesicular structures released by cells to communicate with one another. The growing interest in the (patho) physiological function and potential pharmaceutical application of these vesicles is accompanied by a vast number of new research groups entering this research field and a plethora of different protocols to separate EVs from non-vesicular components. This lack of uniformity often generates conflicting or difficult-to-compare results. Here we provide a comparative analysis of different EV isolation strategies, discussing the purity of the final isolate and highlighting the importance of purity on downstream experimental readouts. First, we show that ultracentrifugation (UC) of B16F10 melanoma cell-derived conditioned medium co-purifies proteins or protein complexes with nuclease activity. Such contaminants should be taken into account when aiming to apply EVs as delivery carriers for exogenous nucleic acids. Second, three commonly used purification strategies (i.e. precipitation, UC and density-gradient centrifugation) were evaluated for their ability to remove non-incorporated fluorescent dye (i.e. the lipophilic PKH67 dye), important when probing EV interactions with cells. For both types of impurities, endogenous and exogenous, density gradient purification outperforms the other evaluated methods. Overall, these results demonstrate that the implementation of stringent purification protocols and adequate controls is of pivotal importance to draw reliable conclusions from downstream experiments performed with EV isolates.

AB The purpose of the present study was to develop gefitinib-loaded polymeric foams that can be used as coating of drug-eluting stents for palliative treatment of bronchotracheal cancer. Release of such an anticancer drug from such stent coating can retard tumor regrowth into the bronchial lumen. Gefitinib-loaded polyurethane (PU) foams were prepared by embedding either gefitinib micronized crystals or gefitinib-loaded poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) microspheres in water-blown films, with up to 10% w/w loading for gefitinib microcrystals and 15% w/w for gefitinib microspheres (corresponding to 1.0% w/w drug loading). Drug-release studies showed sustained release of gefitinib over a period of nine months, with higher absolute release rates at higher drug loading content. By the end of the studied nine month release periods, 60-100% of the loaded gefitinib had been released. Foams loaded with gefitinib-PLGA microspheres at 15% w/w showed accelerated drug release after 4 months, coinciding with the degradation of PLGA microparticles in the PU foam as demonstrated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). When applied on a nitinol braided bronchotrachial stent, PU coatings with gefitinib microspheres showed similar mechanical properties as the drug-free PU coating, which indicated that the loading of microspheres did not affect the mechnical properties of the PU foams. In conclusion, we have fabricated drug-loaded PU foams that are suitable for bronchotracheal stent coating.

AB The possibility to compress ordinary paper into tablets was systematically investigated in this study. Results proved that tablets can be made from paper, independent of the type of paper used. The tablets appear shiny and with a smooth surface. The pharmaceutical quality was acceptable, i.e. all tablets fulfilled the requirements for tablets according to the European Pharmacopeia. Drug-loaded tablets were produced by compression of drug-loaded paper. Drug loading did not alter the pharmaceutical quality. However, the uncoated tablets possessed an extremely fast disintegration, i.e. intense swelling upon contact with water, which might hamper the swallowing after oral administration. To avoid swelling tablets were successfully coated with a polymer film, leading to a prevention of swelling but immediate disintegration in simulated gastric fluid. In fact, tablets made from paper are a novel and promising strategy for improved oral drug delivery. They can be easily produced without any further excipients and possess pharmaceutical quality according to the European Pharmacopeia.

AB A great number of available pharmaceuticals are chiral compounds. Although they are usually manufactured as racemic mixtures, they can be enantioselectively biodegraded as a result of microbial processes. In this paper, a biodegradability assay in similar conditions to those recommended in OECD tests of enantiomers of trimeprazine (a phenothiazine employed as a racemate) is carried out. Experiments were performed in batch mode using a minimal salts medium inoculated with an activated sludge (collected from a Valencian Waste Water Treatment Plant, WWTP) and supplemented with the racemate. The concentration of the enantiomers of trimeprazine were monitored by means of a chiral HPLC method using a cellulose-based chiral stationary phase and 0.5 M NaClO4/acetonitrile (60:40, v/v) mobile phases. Experiments were performed at three concentration levels of the racemate. In parallel, the optical density at 600 nm (OD600) was measured to control the biomass growth and to connect it with enantioselectivity. The calculated enantiomeric fractions (EF) offer the first evidence of enantioselective biodegradation of trimeprazine. A simplified Monod equation was used as a curve fitting approach for concentration (S), biodegradation (BD), and for the first time, EF experimental data in order to expand the usefulness of the results. Precision studies on S (repeatability conditions) and, for the first time, EF (intermediate precision conditions) were also performed. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Forward osmosis (FO) offers to be a very promising technology for the removal of trace organic compounds (TrOCs) from contaminated wastewater, and with the recent developments in FO membranes, the effect of both a higher water flux and reverse salt flux on the rejection of TrOCs needs to be explored. In this study two novel thin-film composite (TFC) membranes with greater water permeability and selectivity than the benchmark cellulose tri-acetate (CTA) membrane were compared at bench-scale in terms of TrOCs permeability. By probing the solute-membrane interactions that dictate the transport of TrOCs through the two membranes in the absence and presence of a draw solution, several conclusions were drawn. Firstly, steric hindrance is the main TrOCs transport-limiting mechanism through TFC membranes unless the negative membrane surface charge is significant, in which case, electrostatic interactions can dominate over steric hindrance. Secondly, the increase in ionic strength induced by the draw solution in the vicinity of and perhaps inside the membrane seems to favour the rejection of TrOCs by "shrinking" the membrane pores or by "shielding" the negative surface charge. Lastly, during FO operation, solute concentration polarisation becomes detrimental when working at high water fluxes, whereas the reverse solute flux has no direct impact on the transport of TrOCs through the membrane.

AB The development of phosphorus-free and biodegradable scale inhibitors has been paid considerable attention. Two series of starch-graft-poly(acrylic acid) (St-g-PM) samples with different grafting ratios and grafted-chain distributions, that is, the number and length of grafted PAA chains on the starch backbone, were designed and prepared in this study. Fourier transform infrared and H-1 nuclear magnetic resonance spectra were used to further characterize the molecular structures of the St-g-PAAs. In addition to dose, the effects of the structural morphologies of St-g-PAA, namely, grafting ratio and grafted-chain distribution, on the scale-inhibition performance against calcium carbonate were investigated systematically. Structural morphology significantly influenced the scale-inhibition performance of St-g-PAA. St-g-PAA with relatively low grafting ratio (<= 97%) displayed better scale-inhibition effect than samples with similar grafted-chain distributions. Meanwhile, under the similar grafting ratios, samples with higher number of branched chains with shorter grafted chains displayed better antiscaling performance. Thus, higher scale-inhibition rate and lower corresponding optimal dose were obtained. Different scale-inhibition mechanisms were involved in the effects of the structural morphology. These mechanisms were investigated in detail from the molecular levels using scanning electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The removal of Escherichia coli (E. coli) from water by zinc oxide-coated zeolite (ZOCZ) and ZOCZ's antibacterial properties were examined in laboratory experiments using plate counting method and tests of cell apoptosis. Batch experiments showed that ZOCZ has a maximum removal capacity for E. coli of about 434 x 10(6) CFU g(-1) at 25 degrees C. Element mappings confirm that zinc ions accumulate in the E. coil cells causing cell death. Pseudo-second-order kinetics and Freundlich isotherms were found to best describe the removal of E. coil, suggesting that a multilayer of E. coil cells forms on the surface of ZOCZ particles.

AB The preliminary assessment of the properties of alginate immobilized aquatic weed Myriophyllum spicatum beads-MsAlg in a multi-element system of nine Serbian lakes water samples was done. Herein, the results obtained in the biosorption experiment with MsAlg contents of twenty-two elements analysed by inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectrometry, biosorption capacity, element removal efficiency, total hardness (TH) and quality index of water (WQI) are presented. Scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy was used for the characterization of M. spicatum and its beads. The study showed that aluminium, magnesium and strontium were adsorbed by MsAlg in the water samples from all examined lakes; barium and iron in the water samples from six lakes. The overall average efficiency of MsAlg in biosorption of elements was in the following order: Al > Ba > Sr > Fe > Mg (58.6, 51.7, 48.2, 23.9 and 17.7%, respectively). The increase of TH and WQI values after the biosorption was noticed in all studied lake water samples. The most significant correlations for pH were regarding the contents of B, Mg and Ca, whereas WQI was highly correlated to the contents of B and Mg, and pH. The complexity of the obtained data was explained by Cluster Analysis and Principal Component Analysis, which showed good discrimination capabilities between the water samples taken from different locations. Considering that the invasive M. spicatum is natural, widespread and that its immobilization is cheap and eco-friendly, presented findings could be helpful in further assessment of MsAlg beads for its potential use as biofilter.

AB The aims of this study are to evaluate, under visible light conditions, the ability of H2O2 and TiO2 to produce center dot OH, their quantitative impacts on the cell integrity of Microcystis, and the subsequent release and degradation of microcystins (MCs). A sequential reaction model was developed, including one sub model to simulate the rupture kinetics for cell integrity of Microcystis, and another to describe the release and degradation of MCs. For cell rupture, the dual-oxidant Delayed Chick-Watson model (DCWM) and dual-oxidant Hom model (HM) were first proposed and developed, giving excellent simulation results of cell rupture kinetics. Kinetic rate constants between Microcystis cells and H2O2 (k(H2O2), (Cell)) as well as center dot OH (k(center dot OH), (Cell)) under visible light successfully separated the individual effects of H2O2 and center dot OH on Microcystis. The dual-oxidant models were further validated with additional experiments, making the models more convincing. Finally, the dual-oxidant cell rupture models were integrated with the MC degradation model and well predicted the observed MCs concentrations in the experimental systems. The results of this study not only demonstrate the potential application of H2O2 and TiO2 for the control of cyanobacteria and metabolites in natural water bodies, but also provide a new methodology to differentiate the individual contributions of the two oxidants, H2O2 and center dot OH, on cell rupture, thus giving a novel way to more precisely determine the effective doses of applied oxidants for cyanobacteria control.

AB The much over-looked element in new sanitation, the transport systems which bridge the source and treatment facilities, is the focus of this study. The knowledge of rheological properties of concentrated domestic slurry is essential for the design of the waste collection and transport systems. To investigate these properties, samples were collected from a pilot sanitation system in the Netherlands. Two types of slurries were examined: black water (consisting of human faecal waste, urine, and flushed water from vacuum toilets) and black water with ground kitchen waste. Rheograms of these slurries were obtained using a narrow gap rotating rheometer and modelled using a Herschel-Bulkley model. The effect of concentration on the slurry are described through the changes in the parameters of the Herschel-Bulkley model. A detailed method is proposed on estimating the parameters for the rheological models. For the black water, yield stress and consistency index follow an increasing power law with the concentration and the behaviour index follows a decreasing power law. The influence of temperature on the viscosity of the slurry is described using an Arrhenius type relation. The viscosity of black water decreases with temperature. As for the black water mixed with ground kitchen waste, it is found that the viscosity increases with concentration and decreases with temperature. The viscosity of black-water with ground kitchen waste is found to be higher than that of black water, which can be attributed to the presence of larger particles in the slurry. (C) 2018 The Authors.

AB A key challenge for osmotic membrane bioreactors (OMBRs) application is reverse solute flux and consequent salt accumulation in the feed side. Herein, a bioelectrochemical system (BES) was employed to drive reverse-fluxed solutes from the feed of an OMBR into a cathode compartment for recovery and subsequent reuse as a draw solute (DS). Compared to an OMBR without BES function, the present OMBR system enhanced water recovery from 925 to 1688 mL and increased the chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal efficiency from 40.2 +/- 8.1 to 75.2 +/- 3.3%, benefited from its lower anolyte conductivity of 9.0 mS cm(-1) than that of the control system (24.1 mS cm(-1)). The CO2 addition significantly improved the ammonia recovery rate to 93.3-116.7 g N m(-3) h(-1) (or 248.0-307.4 g N m(-2) d(-1)),12.1-14.5 times higher than that without CO2 addition. The recovered DS was successfully applied to accomplish water extraction in the reuse test, and such a recovery/reuse process could result in a normalized water recovery of 3870 mL mol DS-1 or a DS usage of 0.26 mol L-1 (of the recovered water). The energy consumption of the system might be compensated by the production of bioenergy, and the net specific energy consumption was estimated to be 0.004-0.112 kWh m(-3) wastewater, 0.007-0.179 kWh kg(-1) removed COD, or 0.001-0.020 kWh kg(-1) recovered NH4+-N. Those results have demonstrated that bioelectrochemical processes can be an effective approach for in situ mitigation of reverse-fluxed solute in OMBR and recovering "the lost DS" towards both reuse and reduced operational expense.

AB The presence of toxic microcystins in algal-impacted surface waters is a concern for drinking water quality management. In this study, the potential of ferrate(VI) to eliminate microcystins during drinking water treatment was assessed by investigating reaction kinetics, reaction sites, transformation products, and toxicity changes for the oxidation of microcystin-LR (MC-LR) as a representative microsystin. The investigations also included several substructural model compounds of MC-LR, such as cinnamic acid and sorbic acid, to elucidate the major transformation products and pathways of MC-LR and olefinic compounds. Second-order rate constants were determined in the pH range 6-10.4 for the reaction of ferrate(VI) with MC-LR and the model compounds. The kinetic data revealed that the olefinic double bonds in the Adda and Mdha residues of MC-LR were the primary ferrate(VI) reaction sites, while the phenyl or guanidine moiety was not the reaction site. This finding was supported by detection and identification of the MC-LR transformation products of double bond cleavage, with high peak abundance in the liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Furthermore, the reaction of ferrate(VI) with cinnamic and sorbic acids formed the corresponding aldehydes and organic acids with near complete carbon mass balance, indicating the oxidative cleavage of the double bonds as the primary reaction pathway. A quantitative protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) binding assay for ferrate(VI)-treated MC-LR solutions showed that the MC-LR transformation products exhibited negligible PP2A binding activity compared to that of the parent MC-LR. Oxidation experiments in a filtered river water matrix spiked with MC-LR demonstrated the efficient elimination of MC-LR during water treatment with ferrate(Vl). (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Groundwater co-contaminated by vanadium (V) (V(V)) and nitrate requires efficient remediation to prevent adverse environmental impacts. However, little is known about simultaneous bio-reductions of V(V) and nitrate supported by gaseous electron donors in aquifers. This study is among the first to examine microbial V(V) reduction and denitrification with hydrogen as the sole electron donor. V(V) removal efficiency of 91.0 +/- 3.2% was achieved in test bioreactors within 7 d, with synchronous, complete removal of nitrate. V(V) was reduced to V(IV), which precipitated naturally under near-neutral conditions, and nitrate tended to be converted to nitrogen, both of which processes helped to purify the groundwater. Volatile fatty acids (VFAs) were produced from hydrogen oxidation. High-throughput 16S rRNA gene sequencing and metagenomic analyses revealed the evolutionary behavior of microbial communities and functional genes. The genera Dechioromonas and Hydrogenophaga promoted bio-reductions of V(V) and nitrate directly coupled to hydrogen oxidation. Enriched Geobacter and denitrifiers also indicated synergistic mechanism, with VFAs acting as organic carbon sources for heterotrophically functional bacteria while reducing V(V) and nitrate. These findings are likely to be useful in revealing biogeochemical fates of V(V) and nitrate in aquifer and developing technology for removing them simultaneously from groundwater.

AB The persistence of toxicity associated with the soluble naphthenic organic compounds (NOCs) of oil sands process-affected water (OSPW) implies that a treatment solution may be necessary to enable safe return of this water to the environment. Due to recent advances in high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS), the majority of the toxicity of OSPW is currently understood to derive from a subset of toxic classes, comprising only a minority of the total NOCs. Herein, oxidative treatment of OSPW with buoyant photocatalysts was evaluated under a petroleomics paradigm: chemical changes across acid-, base- and neutral-extractable organic fractions were tracked throughout the treatment with both positive and negative ion mode electrospray ionization (ESI) Orbitrap MS. Elimination of detected OS+ and NO+ classes of concern in the earliest stages of the treatment, along with preferential degradation of high carbon-numbered O-2(-) acids, suggest that photocatalysis may detoxify OSPW with higher efficiency than previously thought. Application of petroleomic level analysis offers unprecedented insights into the treatment of petroleum impacted water, allowing reaction trends to be followed across multiple fractions and thousands of compounds simultaneously.

AB Preventing formation of large colonies and reducing colony size of the cyanobacterium Microcystis may lead to reductions in bloom formation. Here we investigated the effects of artificial mixing on morphology and disaggregation dynamics of Microcystis colonies in vivo, using a stirring device and a laser particle analyzer. The turbulent dissipation rate (epsilon) was varied from 0.020 to 0.364 m(2) s(-3). We hypothesized that colonies of M. aeruginosa and M. ichthyoblabe would be more susceptible to disaggregation from turbulent mixing than colonies of M. wesenbergii. Our results showed that colony size of M. aeruginosa and M. ichthyoblabe decreased with increased turbulence intensity and duration of stirring for epsilon > 0.094 m(2) s(-3), while M. wesenbergii showed less obvious changes in colony size with mixing. Spherical M. wesenbergii colonies exposed to high turbulence intensities for 30 min gradually transitioned to colony morphologies similar to M. ichthyoblabe and M. aeruginosa-like colonies (irregular, elongated or lobed, with distinct holes). Our results suggest that turbulent mixing is an important factor driving morphological changes of Microcystis colonies, and artificial mixing may effectively reduce colony size of Microcystis, thereby preventing bloom formation.

AB Anaerobic fermentation of organic wastes using microbial mixed cultures is a promising avenue to treat residues and obtain added-value products. However, the process has some important limitations that prevented so far any industrial application. One of the main issues is that we are not able to predict reliably the product spectrum (i.e. the stoichiometry of the process) because the complex microbial community behaviour is not completely understood. To address this issue, in this work we propose a new metabolic network of glucose fermentation by microbial mixed cultures that incorporates electron bifurcation and homoacetogenesis. Our methodology uses NADH balances to analyse published experimental data and evaluate the new stoichiometry proposed. Our results prove for the first time the inclusion of electron bifurcation in the metabolic network as a better description of the experimental results. Homoacetogenesis has been used to explain the discrepancies between observed and theoretically predicted yields of gaseous H-2 and CO2 and it appears as the best solution among other options studied. Overall, this work supports the consideration of electron bifurcation as an important biochemical mechanism in microbial mixed cultures fermentations and underlines the importance of considering homoacetogenesis when analysing anaerobic fermentations.

AB Phosphorus (P) removal from lake/drainage waters by novel adsorbents may be affected by competitive substances naturally present in the aqueous media. Up to date, the effect of interfering substances has been studied basically on simple matrices (single-factor effects) or by applying basic statistical approaches when using natural lake water. In this study, we determined major factors controlling P removal efficiency in 20 aquatic ecosystems in the southeast Spain by using linear mixed models (LMMs). Two non-magnetic-CFH-12 (R) and Phoslock (R)- and two magnetic materials-hydrous lanthanum oxide loaded silica-coated magnetite (Fe-Si-La) and commercial zero-valent iron particles (FeHQ)- were tested to remove P at two adsorbent dosages. Results showed that the type of adsorbent, the adsorbent dosage and color of water (indicative of humic substances) are major factors controlling P removal efficiency. Differences in physico-chemical properties (i.e. surface charge or specific surface), composition and structure explain differences in maximum P adsorption capacity and performance of the adsorbents when competitive ions are present. The highest P removal efficiency, independently on whether the adsorbent dosage was low or high, were 85-100% for Phoslock and CFH-12 (R), 70-100% for Fe-Si-La and 0-15% for FeHQ The low dosage of FeHQ compared to previous studies, explained its low P removal efficiency. Although non-magnetic materials were the most efficient, magnetic adsorbents (especially Fe Si -La) could be proposed for P removal as they can be recovered along with P and be reused, potentially making them more profitable in a long-term period.

AB Legionellae are among the most important waterborne pathogens in industrialized countries. Monitoring and surveillance of Legionella in engineered water systems is usually performed with culture-based methods. Since the advent of culture-independent techniques, it has become clear that Legionella concentrations are often several orders of magnitude higher than those measured by culture-based techniques and that a variable proportion of these non-culturable cells are viable. In engineered water systems, the formation of these viable but non-culturable (VBNC) cells can be caused by different kinds of stress, such as, and most importantly, nutrient starvation, oxidative stress and heat. In this study, the formation of VBNC cells of six Legionella strains under conditions of starvation was monitored in mono species microcosms for up to one year using a combination of different viability indicators. Depending on the strain, complete loss of culturability was observed from 11 days to 8 weeks. During the starvation process, three distinct phases and different sub-populations of VBNC cells were identified. Until complete loss of culturability, the number of membrane-intact cells decreased rapidly to 5.5-69% of the initial cell concentration. The concentration of the sub-population with low esterase activity dropped to 0.03-55%, and the concentration of the highly esterase-active sub-population dropped to 0.01-1.2% of the initial concentration; these sub-populations remained stable for several weeks to months. Only after approximately 200 days of starvation, the number of VBNC cells started to decrease below detection limits. The most abundant VBNC sub-populations were characterized by partially damaged membranes and low esterase-activity. With this study, we showed that upon starvation, a stable VBNC Legionella community may be present over several months in a strain-dependent manner even under harsh conditions. Even after one year of starvation, a small proportion of L pneumophila cells with high esterase-activity was detected. We speculate that this highly active VBNC subpopulation is able to infect amoebae and human macrophages. (C) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Legionella infections are among the most important waterborne infections with constantly increasing numbers of cases in industrialized countries, as a result of aging populations, rising numbers of immunocompromised individuals and increased need for conditioned water due to climate change. Surveillance of water systems is based on microbiological culture-based techniques; however, it has been shown that high percentages of the Legionella populations in water systems are not culturable. In the past two decades, the relevance of such viable but non-culturable (VBNC) legionellae has been controversially discussed, and whether VBNC legionellae can directly infect human macrophages, the primary targets of Legionella infections, remains unclear. In this study, it was demonstrated for the first time that several starved VBNC Legionella strains (four L pneumophila serogroup 1 strains, a serogroup 6 strain and a L. micdadei strain) can directly infect different types of human macrophages and amoebae even after one year of starvation in ultrapure water. However, under these conditions, the strains caused infection with reduced efficacy, as represented by the lower percentages of infected cells, prolonged time in co-culture and higher multiplicities of infection required. Interestingly, the VBNC cells remained mostly non-culturable even after multiplication within the host cells. Amoeba! infection by starved VBNC Legionella, which likely occurs in oligotrophic biofilms, would result in an increase in the bacterial concentration in drinking-water systems. If cells remain in the VBNC state, the real number of active legionellae will be underestimated by the use of culture-based standard techniques. Thus, further quantitative research is needed in order to determine, whether and how many starved VBNC Legionella cells are able to cause disease in humans. (C) 2018 The Authors.

AB The aluminoborosilicate glass samples with substituting La2O3 for Y2O3 were prepared in order to obtain excellent dielectric properties. The samples were prepared by the conventional melting method. The structure, thermal properties and dielectric properties of the samples were investigated by FTIR, DSC and impedance instrument. It can be seen from IR curves that with the increasing of La2O3 (from 0.5 mol% to 3.0 mol%) the average number of bridging oxygen per tetrahedron first increased and then decreased. The DSC curves revealed that Delta T (Delta T = T-c - T-g, T-c and T-g represent the glass crystallization temperature and the glass transition temperature, respectively) first increased and then decreased. It is found that, the glass network structure reached the maximum degree of polymerization when the sample contain 1.5 mol% La2O3. Then continue to increase the content of La2O3 reduced the degree of polymerization. Dielectric constant (epsilon(r)) and dielectric loss (tana) decreased with the increasing of polymerization of the network structure. As a result, aluminoborosilicate glass with 1.5 mol% La2O3 and 1.5 mol% Y2O3 achieved the best structure and dielectric properties (epsilon(r) = 4.67, tan alpha = 7.9 x 10(-4)).

AB Short-lived radiation-induced absorption (RIA) of light peaking at wavelengths > 1700 nm has been revealed in a gamma-irradiated (<= 1 kGy) heavily (50 mol% GeO2) Ge-doped silica optical fiber (Ge-doped fiber) at low temperatures (<= -30 degrees C). This RIA is found to closely resemble in properties the known RIA due to inherent self-trapped holes (STHs) in undoped-silica-core optical fibers (same spectral range, low thermostability, nonmonotonic evolution with dose, shift of the peak wavelength with temperature, Arrhenius dependence on temperature, growth of the activation energy in the course of irradiation and recovery). The STH-like RIA is found not to occur in more lightly Ge-doped fibers and in a Bi-codoped Ge-doped fiber with the same (50 mol%) GeO2 concentration. A possible microscopic structure of the STH in heavily Ge-doped fibers is discussed.

AB In this paper, the surface corrosion mechanisms of Chinese high-peak-power laser glass, the N31 glass, are investigated. Powder samples were immersed in deionized water for up to 72 days. The concentrations of ions in leachate solutions were measured by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy, and the surface evolution during corrosion was characterized by X-ray photoelectron and attenuated total reflection infrared spectroscopies. The N31 glass leaches incongruently, and the normalized ionic release rate decreases with an increase of cation field strength. Depending on the oxygen-to-phosphorus molar ratio (O/P ratio) evolution on the glass surface, the surface corrosion process presents two stages, which can be indirectly supported by the attenuated total reflection infrared spectroscopy results. This study reveals composition and structure evolutions on the glass surface during water corrosion. In addition, our results suggest that the 0/P ratio on glass surface could be used to characterize the surface corrosion degree and mechanisms.

AB A new electrophoretic deposition (EPD) technique is reported for the fabrication of composite coatings containing drugs, which have low solubility in water. We present a conceptually new approach, which is based on the use of bile salts (BS) as solubilizing, charging and film forming agents. Composite films are obtained using tetracycline and ibuprofen as model drugs with commercial BS, such as cholic acid sodium salt and deoxycholic acid sodium salt. The suggested mechanism involves the solubilization of drugs in BS solutions, followed by the formation of mixed charged micelles, containing drugs and charged BS, which allow electrophoretic transport of the drugs to the electrode surface. The EPD mechanism involves pH decrease at the anode surface, protonation of carboxylic groups of BS and formation of water insoluble films. The approach can be used for deposition of other functional organic molecules and inorganic nanoparticles. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB An improved precipitation method was developed to prepare stable nano-hydroxyapatite (HAP) suspension with the aid of steric effect of poly(acrylic acid) (PAA) and acoustic cavitation effect. The effects of reaction temperature and PAA concentration on the formation of nano-HAP suspension were studied. The rising temperature led to the transformation of spherical amorphous calcium phosphate (ACP) to needle-like nano-HAP crystals with the increase in size. The increasing PAA concentration mightily hindered the crystallization of HAP instead of decreasing the size. PAA provided steric effect to stabilize nano-HAP in solution due to the electrostatic interaction between-COO-of PAA and Ca2+ on the surface of HAP. The obtained PAA-stabilized nano-HAP suspension showed good stability in different media (water, PBS, RPMI 1640) and noncytotoxicity. This study provides a potential technology for the controllable synthesis of stable nano-HAP suspension. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The peculiar properties of the large absorption coefficient at near-infrared frequencies as well as their high mobility in germanium enable promising applications in photodetection. Schottky junctions based near-infrared photodetectors were fabricated by integrating monolayer graphene film with germanium membranes stacking on silicon oxide substrates (i.e., GeOI). The device exhibits a strong photovoltaic behavior, giving rise to high responsivity and detectivity of similar to 62.1 mAW(1) and similar to 2.1 x 10(11) cm Hz(1/2)W(1), respectively. Time-response results indicate that the device could operate with the frequency up to 1 kHz. Our work may pave the way for exploiting graphene/GeOI Schottky junctions as the high-performance optoelectronic devices. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The objective of this study is to investigate quantitative assessment of the adhesion behavior of composite films onto a metallic surface. The composite films had UV cured Bis-GMA (Bisphenol A glycidylmethacrylate)/TEGDMA (triethylene glycol dimethacrylate) as matrix and ferrous oxide doped alumina (Al2O3 Fe) particles with two surface modifications, (3-methacryloxypropyltrimethoxysilane) (MEMO) and the vinyltris(2-methoxyethoxy) silane (VTMOEO), as reinforcement. Composites were made with 0.5, 1.5 and 3 wt% of alumina particles. Adhesion was evaluated using the micro hardness testing method. The contact angle was measured and compared to the adhesive parameter from micro hardness measurements. The form of the indent on the surface of the composite film was analyzed in order to correlate the indent morphology to the adhesion quality. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Vertically aligned alpha-MoO3 nanorods are successfully grown on commercial glass substrate by vacuum thermal evaporation technique. This is achieved by using hydrothermally synthesized alpha-MoO3 nanorods powder as precursor. A two-step procedure of thermal evaporation and post annealing in air yielded vertically aligned alpha-MoO3 nanorods perpendicular to the glass substrate. Prepared nanorods are highly crystalline and dense with orthorhombic structure. They have potential application in gas sensing, pseudo super capacitors, field emission etc. The gas sensing properties are under investigation. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB 1D Fe(IO3)(3) particles were synthesized and their structure/microstructure was confirmed with XRD and FE SEM. The UV/Vis spectrum showed a strong absorption in the UV region and a small relative intensity peak at 463 nm (2.68 eV) in visible region was tentetivelly assigned to the Fe3+ indicating the presence of the traces of additional phase. Fe-57 Mossbauer spectra recorded between 294 and 4.3 K showed the magnetic transition around 16 K. Fully magnetic splitted spectra were recorded between 8 and 4.3 K. ZFC-FC magnetic measurements showed the antiferromagnetic behaviour of Fe(IO3)(3). The results of magnetic measurements were in good agreement with Mossbauer spectroscopic results. Thermal decomposition of Fe(IO3)(3) nanorods at 520 and 800 degrees C yielded alpha-Fe2O3 nanorods which were decreased in length and increased in width in relation to the initial 1D Fe(IO3)(3) particles.

In this study, the photonic structure in butterfly wing was inversely replicated with germanium dioxide through a facile liquid phase deposition process. Precise replicas of both micro-tile array and dispersed micro-cubes were produced by adjusting the depositing conditions. This work provides the possibility that the abundant photonic crystals in nature can be further enriched by combining the merits of both artificial tailoring and constituents. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

It demonstrated that the modified IGF-1 uniformly covered on titanium surface and the surface hydrophilicity was significantly increased. Osteoblasts exhibited increased cell adhesion and mineralization. Our results illustrate that minTBP-1-IGF-1 could produce significant enhancement in osteoblasts adherence, mineralization and maturation. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this work, a novel 2D hybrid perovskite of C6H8N2PbBr3 was alternatively produced by reflux method under ambient air condition. The produced material was systematically characterized as potential ligh-tharvesting material for perovskite solar cells (PSCs). The optical energy band measured using UV-Vis was 2.57 eV. The existence of NH3+, pyridinium and Ar-H ions in the produced sample was confirmed by FTIR analysis. Bulk conductivity of the hybrid perovskite sandwiched with TiO2 layer measured by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy was 5.79 x 10(-8) S cm(-1). The sandwiched sample produced V-DC(max) value of 0.65 V under sunlight irradiance. The value sustained over 720 h with +/- 0.07 V. Overall, the performance of the produced novel 2D hybrid meets the requirements as a light-harvesting material. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In order to encapsulate nuclear wastes (NW) enriched in Uranium, they have been designed and obtained vitrified matrices of iron aluminum phosphates including substitution of U by Bi. These glasses have been designed and obtained formulating all from the starting binary composition: 60P(2)O(5).40Fe(2)O(3) where the Fe/P ratio was 0.67. The thermal behavior has been investigated by DTA/TG analysis and thermal expansion, as well as identification of some phases by TEM/EDS. The vitrified structures are difficult to crystallize as is the case of the (Fe + U) contents in the range of 0.50 per P atom. Glasses with Bi-oxide are less resistant to crystallization than those containing U. The glasses here investigated depict a reasonable water chemical stability due to the high percentage of P-O-Fe-O bonds and the presence of U (4+ to 6+). Lately, it has been also investigated the calcination of simulated miniplates of Si2U3/Al having additions of these glasses and U3O8 to dilute this Uranium enriched in MTR combustible (Material Testing Reactor).

AB The waste vitrification of abandoned open sky vermiculite deposits has been considered by combining with a natural phosphate mineral residue. Several batches haven been designed from the composition system: Li2O-MgO-Al2O3-P2O5-SiO2 including some Fe2O3 and Fluoride. The resulting glasses are transparent and smooth green coloured, giving rise after TTT treatments to several opal, opaque glass-ceramics with iridescent surface. Full characterization has been carried out by XRD and electron microscopy with EDS, as well as by XPS spectroscopies, concluding that the main crystalline phases formed were alpha-cordierite and beta-spodumene. The surface of these glass-ceramics from vermiculiteamblygonite is enriched in Fe2O3. Compared to the parent glasses, the final glass-ceramics exhibited and improvement in fracture toughness.

Statistical analysis of the mobility data reveals that low-angle GBs are on average more mobile and show larger spread in their mobilities than high-angle GBs. GBs with axes broadly near < 111 > or boundary planes close to {1 1 0} have relatively high mobility. No visible correlation is found between GB mobility and energy. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB Er3+ doped ZnF2-BaF2-SrF2-YF3 (ZBSY-e) glasses were prepared in a glove box. The absorption coefficient of residual hydroxyl in the glasses was calculated to be similar to 0.001 cm(-1) at 2.7 mu m. Under 978 nm laser diode excitation, intense similar to 2.7 mu m emissions were observed from the ZBSY-e glasses and the emission intensity was much stronger than that obtained in Er3+-doped fluoroindate, fluorozirconate or fluoroaluminate glasses for a same excitation power density. The efficient similar to 2.7 mu m emission could be attributed to the relative low phonon energy (420 cm(-1)) of the ZBSY glass. Our results indicated that the ZBSY-e glass was a potential gain medium for similar to 2.7 mu m lasers. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The effect of dual nitridation processes for both r-plane sapphire and low temperature-grown AlN (LT-AlN) nucleation layer on non-polar a-plane AlGaN epi-layer was studied intensively. A root-meansquare value as small as 1.54 nm for a-plane Al0.53Ga0.47N epi-layer was achieved. It was revealed that the generation of AlN grains as well as the coalescence and recrystallization of LT-AlN islands were the key factors for growing a-plane AlGaN epi-layers with smooth surface morphology. Meanwhile, the evolution of surface morphology with varied nitridation processes and the mechanisms for improving surface morphology of a-plane AlGaN epi-layers were also investigated.

AB Advances in electronics and nuclear energy have led to devices producing greater heat and therefore requiring more efficient cooling systems. The proposed liquid metal based on eutectic Ga-Sn-Zn meets such expectations. First, however, the materials which are used for storage and mostly applied in electronics, such as Cu, should be examined. The investigated liquid/Cu substrate couples were crosssectioned and subjected to scanning electron microscopy to observe interfacial microstructure changes. The created intermetallic Cu-Ga phase layer at the liquid/Cu substrate interface was identified by x-ray diffraction analysis, and the kinetics of the formation and growth of the IMC layer were determined.

AB To prolong the service lifetime of artificial joint, it is imperative to improve mechanical and tribological properties of the prosthetic materials, which could be achieved by adding a surface protective layer. The TiCuN solid-solution coating is highlighted in this work for this application. Higher hardness, lower friction coefficient, and enhanced wear resistance are demonstrated with TiCuN solid-solution coating with 5.2 at% Cu dopant, comparing to pure TiN and TiN/Cu nano-composite coatings. In addition, the live/dead staining and morphology of cells cultured on the surface of TiCuN solid-solution coating point out that the TiCuN coating exhibits excellent biocompatibility, which could be potentially applied as the artificial joint protective coating in human body.

AB Low strain amplitude multi-axial compression (LSA-MAC) increases the work hardening capacity and uniform ductility of Aluminum after Severe Plastic Deformation (SPD) through Equal Channel Angular Pressing (ECAP). The mechanisms associated with this processing after ECAP are analyzed. LSA-MAC after 1 ECAP pass in Aluminum softens the material and is connected to the stabilization of the dislocation structures induced by ECAP into a configuration displaying an increased fraction of High Angle Grain Boundaries (HAGB). This occurs for a lower total imposed strain than that through a sequence of high strain ECAP passes or high strain amplitude multi-axial compression (HAS-MAC). (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB The quest of improving luminescence efficiency in alkaline earth sulfide phosphors has been of great interest due to their applications in diverse areas. We synthesized SrS:Ce-0.05, Sr0.75Ba0.20S:Ce-0.05, Sr0.75Ca0.20S:Ce-0.05 and Sr0.75Ca0.10Ba0.10S:Ce-0.05 phosphors using solid state diffusion method. X-ray diffraction patterns of all the samples were found similar to the cubic SrS phase except minor shifts in angles. To ascertain the valence state of Ce, near edge X-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy was employed using synchrotron radiations. We simulated Ce M-5,M-4-edges of Ce3+ ions using atomic multiplet calculations, which agrees well with the experimental data, clearly suggesting that Ce enters as Ce3+ in all the samples. The photoluminescence spectra of synthesized phosphors exhibit blue-green emission assigned to the 5d-4f transitions in Ce3+ levels, with minor shifts in wavelength. Interestingly, Ca2+/Ba2+ substitution in SrS: Ce phosphors increases the PL intensity considerably. In comparison to SrS: Ce-0.05, PL intensity of Sr0.75Ca0.10Ba0.10S:Ce-0.05 phosphors was enhanced by 2.7 times, which may be exploited in many optical applications. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB Sulfur containing composite cathodes has been reported to yield discharge capacity close to the theoretical capacity for Li-S batteries. However, mainly due to polysulfide dissolution, rapid capacity fading, especially during the first few cycles, could not be averted in most of these cathodes. In the present work, we have synthesized a novel cathode composite comprising of polyaniline, reduced graphene oxide, TiO2 and sulfur. We reported superior discharge capacity (similar to 1010 mA h g (1)), energy density (similar to 1.6 kWh kg (1) at 2 V) and cyclic stability for this composite and discussed the plausible mechanism of its superior electrochemical performance.

AB In the present study, a waste aluminate solution from the anodizing industry was used to synthesize coal fly ash-and blast furnace slag-based geopolymers as metal-immobilizing matrixes. Different alkali-activating agents such as NaOH and sodium silicate have also been used in order to achieve defined Si/Al or Na/Al ratios in the mixtures. Mixtures of simulated waste containing hazardous metals such as Pb, Cd, or Ni with the geopolymer materials have been processed to study the potential of geopolymers as waste immobilizing agents. The effects of composition on the compressive strength and metals leachability were assessed. Of the two aluminate geopolymers studied, those containing slag exhibited better mechanical performance. Concentrations of the metals leached from the stabilized products were strongly pH dependent, showing that the leachate pH was an important variable for the immobilization of metals.

AB Electrospun polymeric/composite scaffolds exhibit a micro/nanofibrous structure that resembles the architecture of native extracellular matrix. The unique properties of the interconnected pores and high porosity of electrospun matrices make them very attractive for applications in tissue engineering scaffolding. However, these structures are formed by densely compacted fibers that exhibit pore sizes lower than cell size, leading to poor cell infiltration. In this work, bead-free electrospun poly(epsilon-caprolactone) fibrous scaffolds were prepared by combining electrospinning and salt-leaching techniques. Non-woven scaffolds were obtained using porogens with different sizes. Liquid extrusion porosimetry was used to accurately determine pore size and its distribution. The structural features of prepared matrices were dependent on the initial porogen size but resulted much smaller than this one. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The objective of this study is the stabilization of two heavy metals Pb and Zn wastes resulting from the treatment by flotation of Pb/Zn ore. The Pb/Zn wastes are encapsulated in Na-geopolymer based on Algerian metakaolin. However, various amount (0, 5, 10 and 15 wt%) of wastes are introduced within geopolymers paste. Leaching test show that Lead is untraceable in all levels of waste content up to 15 wt% because lead content of the waste is very low and its presence in the leachate is below the level of detection by Atomic Absorption Spectroscopy. In the other hand, traces of Zinc were detected in the various leaching solutions. The geopolymers 28 days ages and 10 wt% give the better results due to more stable geopolymer matrix. Leaching is increased when 15 wt% of waste was added due to limited capacity of geopolymers for the heavy metals and deterioration of the structure. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Ti6Al4V is a popular biomaterial for load-bearing implants for bone contact, which can be fabricated by additive manufacturing technologies. Their long-term success depends on their stable anchoring in surrounding bone, which in turn depends on formation of new bone tissue on the implant surface, for which adhesion and proliferation of bone-forming cells is a pre-requisite. Hence, surface coatings which promote cell adhesion and proliferation are desirable.
   Here, Ti6Al4V discs prepared by additive manufacturing (EBM) were coated with layers of pectins, calcium-binding polysaccharides derived from citrus (C) and apple (A), which also contained alkaline phosphatase (ALP), the enzyme responsible for mineralization of bone tissue.
   Adhesion and proliferation of human bone marrow stromal cells (hBMSC) were assessed. Proliferation after 7 days was increased by A-ALP coatings and, in particular, by C-ALP coatings. Cell morphology was similar on coated and uncoated samples. In conclusion, ALP-loaded pectin coatings promote hBMSC adhesion and proliferation. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Nitrogen-doped carbon and helix carbon are both promising materials for capacitor and electromagnetic absorber. However, a combination of these two characteristics is rarely reported yet. Herein, nitrogen-doped helix carbon rods were prepared via a simple carbonization of self-assembled helix polyaniline rods. The morphology and structure of the polyaniline rods and carbon rods were analyzed. The results displayed that the synthesized carbon rods possessed well-defined helix structure, and the atomic ratio of nitrogen element was up to 7.09%. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Molecular dynamics simulations were carried out to study the mechanical response of single crystal Cu with various orientations under uniaxial loading. Cu shows a high degree of elastic anisotropy as a function of the crystal orientations, and the yield stress varies significantly with the crystal orientations and the loading directions. An obvious nonlinear stress-strain response was observed at the elastic deformation stage under applied loading, namely elastic hardening and elastic softening. This nonlinear elastic behavior is derived from the potential energy between atoms and can play a significant role in yield stress and yield asymmetry of crystals under tension and compression.

AB In order to assess the suitability of geopolymers produced from fly ash for use in nuclear waste encapsulation, their behaviour when exposed to gamma radiation has been examined. Irradiation (400 KGy at 4 kGy/h) was found to have had minimal effect on the porosity of bulk samples. Radiolytic hydrogen production from the pore water exhibited a dose rate effect (9 kGy/h up to 280 kGy and 24 kGy/h up to 700 kGy). An effect of surface area was observed with a decrease in hydrogen production corresponding to a decrease in surface area; the effect of pore chemistry was not ruled out.

AB The oversized carbon nanohorns (oversized CNHs) were firstly synthesized by the two-step arc discharge method in positive pressure 0.2 MPa using the first-step CNHs as nucleation center in their formation mechanism. In their structures, the first-step CNHs with "dahlia-like" structure are encapsulated by the outer-CNH-layer of the "bud-like" CNH aggregates. The mean size of the oversized CNHs is similar to 215.8 nm which is almost three times larger than that of the conventional CNHs. The surface area (SSA) of the outer-CNH-layer of oversized CNHs with large interstitial nanopores is calculated to be 270 m(2)/g which is larger than the first-step CNHs (139 m(2)/g). When the first-step CNHs used as the nucleation center of the oversized CNHs are subject to heat treatment, the structures of the oversized CNHs hosting the CNHs which have nanowindows are obtained. Due to the large interstitial nanopores in the outer-CNH-layer and the large size of the oversized CNHs, they should become promising drug delivery carriers. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

The zeolite OFF presented elongated prism morphology and the zeolites GIS and ERI appeared as crystal intergrowths. The products and the expanded perlite were used in a Rhodamine B adsorption study. The zeolitic mixture turned out to be a better adsorber than the expanded perlite, obtaining an efficiency of 90% up to 2 min and an equilibrium efficiency of 72% after 5 min. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB SbPO4 hierarchical microspindles are successfully prepared through a facile solvothermal route. The X-ray powder diffraction, scanning electronic microscopy and nitrogen adsorption-desorption techniques are utilized to characterize the obtained SbPO4 materials. It is found out that the as-prepared SbPO4 microspindles are composed of nanoplates with mesoporous features. A self-assembly process is proposed for the formation of the SbPO4 microspindles. Besides, the SbPO4 microspindles is also tested as an electrode for supercapacitor, which demonstrates an enhanced electrochemical property due to their novel nanostructures. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

DE Geopolymer; Additive manufacturing; 3D printing; Post-processing
AB A previous study presented a method of formulating geopolymer for powder-based 3D concrete printing (3DCP) for construction applications. The highest strength achieved in using this method was 16 MPa. While this is sufficient for some special construction applications, a higher strength is necessary for the majority of the construction applications. The present study presents a number of curing methods to enhance the strength of 3D printed geopolymer parts. The effects of curing temperatures and curing mediums on the compressive strength of geopolymer samples produced via the 3DCP process have been evaluated. Curing of the printed samples has been carried out in tap water, three alkaline solutions and three fly ash-based geopolymer slurries at different temperatures (25 degrees C, 40 degrees C, 60 degrees C and 80 degrees C). Results showed that printed geopolymer samples cured in a combination solution of N Grade sodium silicate solution and sodium hydroxide solution (8.0 M) at 60 degrees C gained the highest compressive strength of 30 MPa. This strength is nearly double the strength achieved in the previous study. The higher strength achieved in this newly developed post-processing method opens up wider range of possible construction applications due to the significantly improved strengths.

AB Good insulating amorphous boron nitride films are grown on Si substrates by radio frequency sputtering method using hexagonal boron nitride target at room temperature. Film thickness by surface profilometer, elemental composition by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, chemical bonding by Raman spectroscopy and morphologies by scanning electron microscopy, have been studied. The grown films are of sp(2)-bonded BN and verified the assumption that growth rate varies as the growth mode transition occurs. Electrical properties are elaborated via current-voltage characteristics and capacitance-voltage profiling has been studied based on metal-insulator-semiconductor (MIS) structure. Breakdown failure was evaluated to be greater than 10 MV/cm while dielectric constant was more than 3 for grown films. This exploration will support to synthesize BN at low temperature and expand its usage in electronics. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Model Fe-Cr alloys with and without W were nanostructured by severe plastic deformation at 350 degrees C. Transmission electron microscopy observations of the microstructure indicate that the addition of 1 wt % of W led to a reduction of the mean grain size from 129 to 110 nm. Atom probe analyses show that only Cr and Si segregate at grain boundaries during deformation while W remains homogeneously distributed. This solid solution leads to higher mechanical strength and plasticity as compared to Fe-Cr. The origin of the beneficial effect of W on the mechanical performance is discussed.

For the 3 at% graphene (G) doped long wire with 1.4 mm diameter, the critical current is about 530 A at 4 T, which is 45% higher than that of the undoped sample. Moreover, the G doped wire has higher irreversible strain of 38% in comparison to the undoped one of 30% after 650 degrees C x 2 h annealing.

AB In this work, nickel oxide (NiO) film was prepared on 4H-SiC (0001) by radio frequency magnetron sputtering to form NiO/4H-SiCp-n heterojunction for the first time. XRD results indicated NiO film had (200), (220), and (020) oriented crystal structures and SEM results showed homogeneous distribution of small grains on 4H-SiC substrate. The optical band gap for NiO was calculated as 3.75 eV by UV-visible absorption spectra. The current-voltage characteristic of the NiO/4H-SiCp-n heterojunction showed a typical rectification behavior with a turn-on voltage of 1.4 V. The discontinuities of the valence band edge and the conduction band edge were estimated to be 1.15 eV and 1.64 eV, respectively. The differences in barrier heights for holes and electrons indicated an improved hole injection capacity of NiO/4H-SiC-p-n heterojunction. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB To obtain a symmetric hyperbolic moment system from the linearised Boltzmann equation, we approximate the entropy variable (derivative of the entropy functional) with the help of multi-variate polynomials in the velocity space. Choosing the entropy functional to be quadratic, we retrieve the Grad's approximation for the linearised Boltzmann equation.
   We develop a necessary and sufficient condition for the entropy stability of the Grad's approximation on bounded position domain with inflow and outflow boundaries. These conditions show the importance of using the Onsager Boundary Conditions (OBCs) Rana and Struchtrup (2016) [28] for obtaining entropy stability and we use them to prove that a broad class of Grad's approximations, equipped with boundary conditions obtained through continuity of odd fluxes Grad (1949) [17], are entropy unstable. Entropy stability, for the Grad's approximation, is obtained through entropy stabilization of the boundary conditions obtained through the continuity of odd fluxes. Since many practical implementations require the prescription of an inflow velocity, the entropy bounds for two possible methods to achieve the same is discussed in detail, both for the linearised Boltzmann equation and its Hermite approximation. We use the Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) discretization in the physical space, to study several benchmark problems to ascertain the physical accuracy of the proposed entropy stable Grad's approximation.

AB We propose a new computational approach for embedded boundary simulations of hyperbolic systems and, in particular, the linear wave equations and the nonlinear shallow water equations. The proposed approach belongs to the class of surrogate/approximate boundary algorithms and is based on the idea of shifting the location where boundary conditions are applied from the true to a surrogate boundary. Accordingly, boundary conditions, enforced weakly, are appropriately modified to preserve optimal error convergence rates. This framework is applied here in the setting of a stabilized finite element method, even though other spatial discretization techniques could have been employed. Accuracy, stability and robustness of the proposed method are tested by means of an extensive set of computational experiments for the acoustic wave propagation equations and shallow water equations. Comparisons with standard weak boundary conditions imposed on body-fitted grids, which conform to the geometry of the computational domain boundaries, are also presented. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

AB An extension of the Material Point Method [1] based on the Discontinuous Galerkin approximation (DG) [2] is presented here. A solid domain is represented by a collection of particles that can move and carry the fields of the problem inside an arbitrary computational grid in order to provide a Lagrangian description of the deformation without mesh tangling issues. The background mesh is then used as a support for the Discontinuous Galerkin approximation that leads to a weak form of conservation laws involving numerical fluxes defined at element faces. Those terms allow the introduction of the characteristic structure of hyperbolic problems within the numerical method by using an approximate Riemann solver [3]. The Discontinuous Galerkin Material Point Method, which can be viewed as a Discontinuous Galerkin Finite Element Method (DGFEM) with modified quadrature rule, aims at meeting advantages of both mesh-free and DG methods. The method is derived within the finite deformation framework for multidimensional problems by using a total Lagrangian formulation. A particular attention is paid to one specific discretization leading to a stability condition that allows to set the CFL number at one. The approach is illustrated and compared to existing or developed analytical solutions on one-dimensional problems and compared to the finite element method on two-dimensional simulations.

AB This paper serves to treat boundary conditions numerically with high order accuracy in order to suit the two-stage fourth-order finite volume schemes for hyperbolic problems developed in J. Li and Z. Du (2016) [17]. As such, it is significant when capturing small scale structures near physical boundaries. Different from previous contributions in literature, the current approach constructs a fourth order accurate approximation to boundary conditions by only using the Jacobian matrix of the flux function (characteristic information) instead of its successive differentiation of governing equations leading to tensors of high ranks in the inverse Lax-Wendroff method. Technically, data in several ghost cells are constructed with interpolation so that the interior scheme can be implemented over boundary cells, and theoretical boundary condition has to be modified properly at intermediate stages so as to make the two-stage scheme over boundary cells fully consistent with that over interior cells. This is nonintuitive and highlights the fact that theoretical boundary conditions are only prescribed for continuous partial differential equations (PDEs), while they must be approximated in a consistent way (even though they could be exactly valued) when the PDEs are discretized. Several numerical examples are provided to illustrate the performance of the current approach when dealing with general boundary conditions. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The presence of current in the ocean can significantly modify the characteristics of ocean waves, and it is considered as an important factor responsible for the occurrence of extreme waves, e.g., rogue waves, which are well known as great threats to ocean engineering practices. The magnitude and direction of ocean current normally vary spatially and ocean waves can become very large and steep. Accurate and efficient phasere-solved numerical methods of fully nonlinear wave-current interactions on a large scale in three dimensions (3D) are required to understand their properties, but the existing phase-resolved methods are all based on the assumption of linear or weakly nonlinear interactions. This paper will address the issues and present a fully nonlinear numerical method to model the 3D interactions between waves and varying current on a large scale using a phase-resolved formulation. A new set of equations describing the three-dimensional, fully nonlinear interactions between waves and horizontally shearing current is proposed. They are derived by making no assumption on wave steepness or the order of wave-current interactions. The resulting new equations correctly describe the free surface boundary conditions by representing the fully nonlinear wave-current interactions, removing the limitation to the small wave steepness of the existing formulations in literature.
   On this basis, the recently developed Enhanced Spectral Boundary Integral (short as ESBI) method is further enhanced to be able to model the wave-current interactions using the new equations, by developing the appropriate procedure for dealing with the extra terms related to nonlinear wave-current interactions. The new equations are used as the prognostic equations for updating the free surface in time domain, and a fast converging iterative technique is employed to solve them. The robustness of the newly developed method is demonstrated through comparing with experimental data available in literature and good agreements are observed in the several different cases, including the 3D fully nonlinear interactions between ocean waves and horizontally varying current. A comparison with the Higher-Order Spectrum (HOS) method based on weak-nonlinear formulations of wave-current interactions is also made to confirm larger error does appear if the wave steepness is high by using the HOS. The method presented in the paper can be employed to simulate the real evolution of ocean waves on current in a phase-resolved way to give deep insights to the dynamics of wave-current interactions, which may not be done correctly by the existing methods so far.

AB We propose herein an efficient monolithic projection method (MPM) to solve time-dependent conjugate heat transfer problems involving not only natural convection in the fluid domain and heat conduction in the solid domain, but also the thermal interaction between solid and fluid domains across the solid-fluid interface. We obtain a global discretized linearized system by advancing the buoyancy, nonlinear convection, and linear diffusion terms in time using the Crank-Nicolson scheme and introducing the second-order central finite difference in space along with linearizing the nonlinear convection terms in both momentum and energy equations. The energy equations are simultaneously and implicitly discretized in both solid and fluid domains with the implemented Taylor series expansion for thermal interaction normal to the interface without an involved sub-time step iteration. Approximated lower-upper decompositions and an approximate factorization are also imposed to speed up the computation. Thus, we obtain a non-iterative monolithic projection method over the entire domain. Numerical simulations of two-dimensional (2D) conjugate natural convection and 2D conjugate Rayleigh-Benard convection and periodic forced flows are performed to investigate the numerical performance of the proposed method. Consequently, the MPM correctly predicts the solution of the conjugate natural convection problem involving strong thermal interactions and provides a more stable and efficient computation than the semi-implicit projection method proposed by Kim and Moffi (1985) [21] with a loosely or strongly coupled algorithm for the solid-fluid interface, while preserving the second-order temporal and spatial accuracy. Finally, the proposed method reasonably simulates a typical real-world problem, namely conjugate heat transfer through double-pane windows, by considering 2D heat conduction in each pane of glass for three different climatic conditions. Using the proposed MPM, we also investigate the effects of the air layer thickness ranging from 5 mm to 40 mm on the averaged Nusselt number and the distribution of temperature as well as fluid motion.

A class of energy particles accounting for the temperature over and above the ambient are added to the vortex tubes in the VFM. Successful implementation of the algorithm requires advances in code acceleration via parallelization of computation, storage and load balancing, improvements to the specification of loop removal and the development of a least-square scheme for baroclinic generation of vortex tubes. Tests of the methodology are carried out for the rise of elliptically shaped heated regions due to natural convection and comparison to previous grid-based calculations. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

AB We present a fast, robust algorithm to determine rigid and floppy structures in two-dimensional (2D) assemblies of saturated frictional particles, based upon a generalisation (Lee and Streinu (2008) [11]) of the classical pebble game algorithm [Jacobs and Hendrickson (1997) [10]) for frictionless systems. By saturated, we refer to frictional systems for which all particle contacts involve sliding friction, which is relevant for certain frictional models and the study of incipient flow and stress-strain hysteresis. Whilst we do not present a mathematical proof of this method, we demonstrate validity via comparison with results from a classical method based on the network stiffness matrix over a diverse range of particle assemblies, including diluted bond networks and assemblies of cohesive, frictional particles.

AB In this paper, we introduce a new heterogeneous fast multipole method (H-FMM) for 2-D Helmholtz equation in layered media. To illustrate the main algorithm ideas, we focus on the case of two layers in this work. The key compression step in the H-FMM is based on a fact that the multipole expansion for the sources of the free-space Green's function can be used also to compress the far field of the sources of the layered-media or domain Green's function, and a similar result exists for the translation operators for the multipole and local expansions. The mathematical error analysis is shown rigorously by an image representation of the Sommerfeld spectral form of the domain Green's function. As a result, in the H-FMM algorithm, the multipole-to-multipole, multipole-to-local, and local-to-local translation operators are the same as those in the free-space case, allowing easy adaptation of existing free-space FMM. All the spatially variant information of the domain Green's function is collected into the multipole-to-local translations and therefore the FMM becomes heterogeneous. The compressed representation further reduces the cost of evaluating the domain Green's function when computing the local direct interactions. Preliminary numerical experiments are presented to demonstrate the efficiency and accuracy of the algorithm with much improved performance over some existing methods for inhomogeneous media.

AB We present a comprehensive study of temporal Low-Level acoustic Descriptors (LLDs) to automatically segment anuran calls in audio streams. The acoustic segmentation, or syllable extraction, is a key task shared by most of the bioacoustical species recognition systems. Consequently, the syllable extraction has a direct impact on the classification rate. In this work, we assess several new entropy measures including the recently developed Permutation Entropy, Weighted Permutation Entropy, and Permutation Min-Entropy, and compare them to the classical Energy, Zero Crossing Rate and Spectral Entropy. In addition, we propose an algorithm to estimate the optimal segmentation threshold value used to separate deterministic segments from stochastic ones avoiding the creation of thin clusters. To assess the performance of our segmentation approach, we applied a frame-by-frame, a point-to-point and an event-to event comparisons. We show that in a scenario with severe noise conditions (SNR <= 0dB), simple entropy descriptors are robust, achieving 97% of segmentation performance, while keeping a low computational cost. We conclude that there is no LLD that is suitable for all scenarios, and we must adopt multiple or different LLDs, depending on the expected noise conditions. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB A novel rough fuzzy joint probabilistic data association algorithm (RF-JPDA) is presented to improve the performance of multitarget tracking in the presence of clutter, electronic countermeasures (ECM) and false alarms. The possibility data association matrix is evaluated by applying upper and lower approximations of validated measurements which are obtained from the radar. Four case studies are taken to validate the proposed data association algorithm. The proposed technique performance has been compared with conventional joint probabilistic data association filter (JPDA), fuzzy clustering means (FCM), and fuzzy Genetic Algorithm (Fuzzy-GA) approaches. A hybrid data association approach is formulated and examined for multi-target tracking using intelligent technique. Further, it is evident from the experimental results that RF-JPDA approach is providing enhanced performance in terms of position root mean square error (RMSE), velocity RMSE and execution time for all cases. The average position and velocity RMSE of RF-JPDA are 42.3% and 16.98% less when compared to conventional JPDA. Thus accomplishing novel and effective multiple target tracking algorithm based on expert systems. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Large graphs are scale-free, ubiquitous having irregular relationships and non-trivial topology. Frequent subgraph mining is a popular method for knowledge extraction from graphs. Most of the existing frequent subgraph mining algorithms are centralized algorithms that cannot handle a single large graph efficiently and incur high communication cost. However, to make the task of subgraph mining less expensive computationally, approximate subgraph mining can be applied which will capture similar structure subgraphs as of exact subgraph mining. In this paper, we propose an approximate subgraph mining algorithm named Ap-FSM implemented on distributed graph environment Pregel. The working of Ap-FSM is divided into three phases. The first phase selects the representative graph from the original graph while preserving the original graph properties. The second phase efficiently performs subgraph extension. Phase 3 introduces a novel two-step optimization for performing subgraph pruning. Analyzing such large graph data will be beneficial from the perspective of expert and intelligent systems, as discovered patterns can be used for knowledge discovery and decision making. To evaluate the performance of Ap-FSM, experiments are performed over three real life datasets having up to billion edges. The results show that the proposed Ap-FSM significantly outperforms the state-of-art frequent subgraph mining algorithms and overcome the challenges of performing frequent subgraph mining on a massive large graph. It is also shown that ApFSM achieves high scalability and speedup in distributed graph environment and is highly accurate in finding frequent subgraphs from a single large graph.

AB Ensemble of Classifiers are composed of parallel-organized components (individual classifiers) whose outputs are combined using a combination method that provides the final output for an ensemble. In this context, Dynamic Ensemble Systems (DES) is an ensemble-based system that, for each test pattern, a different ensemble structure is defined, in which a subset of classifiers is selected from an initial pool of classifiers, During the selection process of a DES, any criterion can be used, being the most important ones accuracy and distance. Distance measures are used to assess the distance of the classifier outputs within a validation set and the main examples of this measure are diversity and similarity. In this paper, we investigate the impact of selection criteria in DES methods. More specifically, we focus on the use of different distance measures (diversity and similarity) as selection criteria. In other to do this, an empirical analysis has been conducted using six different DES methods (three of them are existing methods and the remaining three are proposed in this paper) and with 20 different classification datasets. Our findings indicated that a distance measure improves the overall performance of the state-of-the-art ensemble generation methods. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Phishing was a threat in the cyber world a couple of decades ago and still is today. It has grown and evolved over the years as phishers are getting creative in planning and executing the attacks. Thus, there is a need for a review of the past and current phishing approaches. A systematic, comprehensive and easy-to-follow review of these approaches is presented here. The relevant mediums and vectors of these approaches are identified for each approach. The medium is the platform which the approaches reside and the vector is the means of propagation utilised by the phisher to deploy the attack. The paper focuses primarily on the detailed discussion of these approaches. The combination of these approaches that the phishers utilised in conducting their phishing attacks is also discussed. This review will give a better understanding of the characteristics of the existing phishing techniques which then acts as a stepping stone to the development of a holistic anti-phishing system. This review creates awareness of these phishing techniques and encourages the practice of phishing prevention among the readers. Furthermore, this review will gear the research direction through the types of phishing, while also allowing the identification of areas where the anti-phishing effort is lacking. This review will benefit not only the developers of anti-phishing techniques but the policy makers as well. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID ACTION SEGMENTATION
AB Praxis test is a gesture-based diagnostic test which has been accepted as diagnostically indicative of cortical pathologies such as Alzheimer's disease. Despite being simple, this test is oftentimes skipped by the clinicians. In this paper, we propose a novel framework to investigate the potential of static and dynamic upper-body gestures based on the Praxis test and their potential in a medical framework to automatize the test procedures for computer-assisted cognitive assessment of older adults.
   In order to carry out gesture recognition as well as correctness assessment of the performances we have recollected a novel challenging RGB-D gesture video dataset recorded by Kinect v2, which contains 29 specific gestures suggested by clinicians and recorded from both experts and patients performing the gesture set. Moreover, we propose a framework to learn the dynamics of upper-body gestures, considering the videos as sequences of short-term clips of gestures. Our approach first uses body part detection to extract image patches surrounding the hands and then, by means of a fine-tuned convolutional neural network (CNN) model, it learns deep hand features which are then linked to a long short-term memory to capture the temporal dependencies between video frames.
   We report the results of four developed methods using different modalities. The experiments show effectiveness of our deep learning based approach in gesture recognition and performance assessment tasks. Satisfaction of clinicians from the assessment reports indicates the impact of framework corresponding to the diagnosis. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

DE Web traffic; Anomaly detection; Deep learning; C-LSTM
AB Web traffic refers to the amount of data that is sent and received by people visiting online websites. Web traffic anomalies represent abnormal changes in time series traffic, and it is important to perform detection quickly and accurately for the efficient operation of complex computer networks systems. In this paper, we propose a C-LSTM neural network for effectively modeling the spatial and temporal information contained in traffic data, which is a one-dimensional time series signal. We also provide a method for automatically extracting robust features of spatial-temporal information from raw data. Experiments demonstrate that our C-LSTM method can extract more complex features by combining a convolutional neural network (CNN), long short-term memory (LSTM), and deep neural network (DNN). The CNN layer is used to reduce the frequency variation in spatial information; the LSTM layer is suitable for modeling time information; and the DNN layer is used to map data into a more separable space. Our C-LSTM method also achieves nearly perfect anomaly detection performance for web traffic data, even for very similar signals that were previously considered to be very difficult to classify. Finally, the C-LSTM method outperforms other state-of-the-art machine learning techniques on Yahoo's well-known Webscope S5 dataset, achieving an overall accuracy of 98.6% and recall of 89.7% on the test dataset.

AB Efficient digital filter design is an essential signal processing task. Finite Impulse Response (FIR) filters are used in many applications due to its properties of linear phase and frequency stability. Most traditional design methods suffer from the problem of insufficient control over the frequency response of the designed filter. For this reason, the use of a recently developed optimisation technique called flowers pollination algorithm (FPA), -based on the natural process of pollination of flowers-along with a novel multiple fitness function, is proposed in order to obtain optimised filter coefficients that best approximate ideal specifications. Results have been compared to both traditional methods (mainly windowing and the Parks-McClellan algorithm) as well as to several nature-inspired schemes. Finally, processing of a real EEG signal is used to quantitatively evaluate performance of designed filters. Numerical results show that our method achieves better fit to desired filter specifications, a 5 - 10 times larger attenuation in the stop band and a narrower transition band, at the expense of slightly increasing the pass-band ripple (5 - 15%) in 3 out of 4 of the cases.

AB Support vector machine (SVM) has been used widely for classification of electroencephalogram (EEG) signals for the diagnosis of neurological disorders such as epilepsy and sleep disorders. SVM shows good generalization performance for high dimensional data due to its convex optimization problem. The incorporation of prior knowledge about the data leads to a better optimized classifier. Different types of EEG signals provide information about the distribution of EEG data. To include prior information in the classification of EEG signals, we propose a novel machine learning approach based on universum support vector machine (USVM) for classification. In our approach, the universum data points are generated by selecting universum from the EEG dataset itself which are the interictal EEG signals. This removes the effect of outliers on the generation of universum data. Further, to reduce the computation time, we use our approach of universum selection with universum twin support vector machine (UTSVM) which has less computational cost in comparison to traditional SVM. For checking the validity of our proposed methods, we use various feature extraction techniques for different datasets consisting of healthy and seizure signals. Several numerical experiments are performed on the generated datasets and the results of our proposed approach are compared with other baseline methods. Our proposed USVM and proposed UTSVM show better generalization performance compared to SVM, USVM, Twin SVM (TWSVM) and UTSVM. The proposed UTSVM has achieved highest classification accuracy of 99% for the healthy and seizure EEG signals. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB During millions of years, nature has developed patterns and processes with interesting characteristics. They have been used as inspiration for a significant number of innovative models that can be extended to solve complex engineering and mathematical problems. One of the most famous patterns present in nature is the Golden Section (GS). It defines an especial proportion that allows the adequate formation, selection, partition, and replication in several natural phenomena. On the other hand, Evolutionary algorithms (EAs) are stochastic optimization methods based on the model of natural evolution. One important process in these schemes is the operation of selection which exerts a strong influence on the performance of their search strategy. Different selection methods have been reported in the literature. However, all of them present an unsatisfactory performance as a consequence of the deficient relations between elitism and diversity of their selection procedures. In this paper, a new selection method for evolutionary computation algorithms is introduced. In the proposed approach, the population is segmented into several groups. Each group involves a certain number of individuals and a probability to be selected, which are determined according to the GS proportion. Therefore, the individuals are divided into categories where each group contains individual with similar quality regarding their fitness values. Since the possibility to choose an element inside the group is the same, the probability of selecting an individual depends exclusively on the group from which it belongs. Under these conditions, the proposed approach defines a better balance between elitism and diversity of the selection strategy. Numerical simulations show that the proposed method achieves the best performance over other selection algorithms, in terms of its solution quality and convergence speed. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The Twitter messaging service has become a platform for customers and news consumers to express sentiments. Accurately capturing these sentiments has been challenging for researchers. The traditional approaches to Twitter Sentiment Analysis (TSA) include dictionary-based and use supervised machine learning tools for sentiment classification. This research follows the supervised machine learning approach. A major challenge for the machine learning approach is feature selection, which is often domain dependent. We address this specific challenge and present a novel approach to identify a lexicon set unique to TSA. We show that this Twitter Specific Lexicon Set(TSLS) is small, and most importantly, is domain transferable. This identification process generates a collection of vectorized tweets for input to machine learning tools. In traditional approaches, this vectorization often results in a highly sparse input matrix which produces low accuracy measures. In this research, we hierarchically reduce the feature set to a small set of seven "meta features" to reduce sparsity. We show that TSA based on these features can produce highly accurate results using a dynamic architecture for neural networks (DAN2) and SVM (machine learning tools) as measured by recall, precision, and F-1 metrics (the harmonic average of precision and recall). Our results show that a Twitter Generic Feature Set (TGFS) derived from two datasets (@JustinBieber and@Starbucks) is domain transferable and when combined with only a few Twitter Domain Specific Features (TDSF) (less than 3%), can produce excellent sentiment classification values. We evaluate the effectiveness and transferability of the TGFS across three new and distinct domains (@GovChristie, @SouthwestAir, and @VerizonWireless). (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Data preprocessing is an important step for designing classification model. Normalization is one of the preprocessing techniques used to handle the out-of-bounds attributes. This work develops 14 classification models using different learning algorithms for dynamic selection of normalization technique. This work extracts 12 data complexity measures for 48 datasets drawn from the KEEL dataset repository. Each of these datasets is normalized using min-max and z-score normalization technique. G-mean index is estimated for these normalized datasets using Gaussian Kernel Extreme Learning Machine (KELM) in order to determine the best-suited normalization technique. The data complexity measures along with the best suited normalization technique are used as an input for developing the aforementioned dynamic models. These models predict the best suitable normalization technique based on the estimated data complexity measures of the dataset The result shows that the model developed using Gaussian Kernel ELM (KELM) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) give promising results for most of the evaluated classification problems.

AB The selection of an optimal, efficient and reliable transport and logistics policy is one of the most important factors in supply chain management and logistics planning. Given that decision making in transport and logistics involves the consideration of a number of opposite criteria and possible solutions, such a selection can be considered as a multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) problem. This study presents a new integrated approach to decision making, i.e. the generation of a robust decision making rule (RDMR) by combining different MCDM methods and Taguchi's robust quality engineering principles. As a logical implication of the proposed approach, a conceptual model of an adaptive and interactive expert system is developed. Its purpose is to enhance the decision making process through enabling the decision maker to: (i) use higher level knowledge regarding the selection of criteria weights and MCDM methods, (ii) estimate the ranking of a new alternative, which can be added to the initial decision matrix after a posteriori analysis of the final rankings of alternatives, and, moreover, quantify its distance from the ideal and the anti-ideal solution. Five different case studies in the field of transport and logistics were considered in order to illustrate the proposed approach. The obtained results and the results of the other MCDM methods were compared using Kendall's tau-b and Spearman's rho tests. An analysis of the final rank stability with respect to the changes in criteria weights was also performed so as to assess the sensitivity of the alternative rankings obtained by the application of different MCDM methods and the proposed approach. To this aim, the Monte Carlo simulation was conducted covering 1000 different scenarios of criteria weights in three different cases. Finally, an additional procedure was introduced for an explicit representation of an RDMR using the design of experiments (DOE) principles. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The urban transit network design problem (UTNDP) is concerned with the development of a set of transit routes and corresponding schedules on an existing road network with known demand points and travel time. It is an NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem characterized by high computational intractability, leading to utilization of a wide variety of heuristics and metaheuristics in an attempt to find near-optimal solutions. This paper proposes a differential evolution approach to address the UTNDP by simultaneously determining the set of transit routes and their associated service frequency with the objective to minimize the passenger cost, as well as the unmet demand. In addition, a combined repair mechanism is employed to deal with the infeasible route sets generated from the route construction heuristic and the operators of the differential evolution. The proposed algorithm is evaluated on a well-known Mandl's Swiss network reported in the literature. Computational experiments show that the proposed algorithm is competitive according to the performance metrics with other approaches in the literature. (C) 2018 The Author(s).

AB Background: Children immunization with pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) had profound public health effects across the globe. Colombian adopted PCV10 universal vaccination, but PCV incremental impact need to be revalued. The objective of this analysis was to estimate the cost-effectiveness of switch to PCV13 versus continue PCV10 in Colombian children.
   Methods: A complete economic analysis was carried-out assessing potential epidemiological and economic impact of switching from PCV10 to PCV13. Epidemiological information on PCV10 impact was obtained from lab-based epidemiological surveillance on pneumococcal isolates at the Colombian National Institute of Health. Economic inputs were extracted from the literature. Incremental PCV13 effectiveness was based in additional serotypes included. Comparisons among alternatives were evaluated with the Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio (ICER) at a willingness to pay of one GDP per capita (USD$ 6631) per Year of Live Saved (YLS). All costs were reported in 2014USD. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed, and 95% confidence interval reported.
   Results: After four years using PCV10 for universal vaccination on children the Colombian health surveillance system showed a relative increment on non PCV10 isolates. To change from PCV10 to PCV13 would avoid 587 (C195% -49-1008) ambulatory Rx community-acquired pneumoniae (CAP), 1622 (CI95% 5912343) Inpatient RxCAP, 10 (CI 95% 6-11) pneumococcal meningitis, and 79 (CI95% 76-98) deaths. ICER per YLS was USD$ 2319 (CI95% Dominated - USD$ 4225) for Keep-PCV10 and USD$ 1771 (CI95% USD$ 1285-9884) for Switch-to PCV13. In spite of its cost-effectiveness Keep-PCV10 is an extended dominated alternative and Switch-to PCV13 would be preferred. Results are robust to parameters changes in the sensitivity analyses.
   Conclusion: A national immunization strategy based in Switch-to PCV13 was found to be good value for money and prevent additional burden of pneumococcal disease saving additional treatment costs, when compared with to Keep-PCV10 in Colombia, however additional criteria to decision making must be taken into account.

AB Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) infection can be prevented by vaccination. Vaccines containing the small (S) envelope protein are currently used in universal vaccination programs and achieve protective immune response in more than 90% of recipients. However, new vaccination strategies are necessary for successful immunization of the remaining non- or low-responders. We have previously characterized a novel HBV chimeric antigen, which combines neutralization epitopes of the S and the preS1 domain of the large (L) envelope protein (genotype D). The S/preS1(21-47) chimera produced in mammalian cells and Nicotiana benthamiana plants, induced a significantly stronger immune response in parenterally vaccinated mice than the S protein. Here we describe the transient expression of the S/preS1(21-47)antigen in an edible plant, Lactuca sativa, for potential development of an oral HBV vaccine. Our study shows that oral administration of adjuvant-free Lactuca sativa expressing the SipreS1(21-47) antigen, three times, at 1 mu g/dose, was sufficient to trigger a humoral immune response in mice. Importantly, the elicited antibodies were able to neutralize HBV infection in an NTCP-expressing infection system (HepG2-NTCP cell line) more efficiently than those induced by mice fed on Lactuca sativa expressing the S protein. These results support the S/preS1(21-47) antigen as a promising candidate for future development as an edible HBV vaccine. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Phase 1 clinical studies will soon evaluate novel HIV-1 envelope immunogens targeting distinct 'germline' and memory B cell receptors to ultimately elicit HIV-1 broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs). The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) recently convened a panel of US-based expert scientists, clinicians, sponsors and ethicists to discuss the role of sampling draining lymph nodes within preventive HIV vaccine trials. The meeting addressed the importance of evaluating germinal center (GC) responses following immunization to predict bNAb potency and breadth, and reviewed key aspects of this procedure within the clinical research setting, including informed consent, adverse event monitoring, study participant acceptability, medical expertise and training. We review highlights from the meeting and discuss the advantages and disadvantages of sampling lymph nodes by excisional biopsies compared to fine needle aspirations (FNA) in the context of prophylactic HIV vaccine trials.

AB Background: Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) vaccine was introduced as a voluntary vaccine in December 2008 and was included in the national routine immunization program in April 2013 in Japan. Currently, no nationwide data are available to evaluate the effectiveness of Hib vaccine in Japan.
   Methods: To evaluate the effectiveness of Hib vaccine in Japan, nationwide active population-based surveillance of culture-proven invasive infections caused by H. influenzae in children was performed in 2008-2017 in 10 prefectures in Japan (covering approximately 23% of the total Japanese population). Clinical data were recorded on a standardized case report form. Capsular type and antimicrobial susceptibility of the H. influenzae isolates were examined. The incidence rate ratio (IRR) and its confidence interval (CI) were calculated to compare data from 5 years before and that from after the introduction of the national routine Hib vaccine immunization program.
   Results: During the 10-year study period, 566 invasive H. influenzae disease cases including 336 meningitis cases were identified. The average number of invasive H. influenzae disease cases among children <5 years of age during 2013-2017 decreased by 93% (IRR: 0.07, 95%CI 0.05-0.10, p < 0.001) compared with those occurring during 2008-2012. Hib strains have not been isolated from invasive H. influenzae disease cases since 2014; however, non-typeable H. influenzae and H. influenzae type f isolates have been noted as causes of invasive H. influenzae diseases among children <5 years in the post-Hib vaccine era.
   Conclusions: After the governmental subsidization of the Hib vaccine, invasive Hib disease cases decreased dramatically in the study population, as per our surveillance. Continuous surveillance is necessary to monitor the effectiveness of Hib vaccine and for detecting any emerging invasive capsular types. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background: Pneumococcus is a common cause of invasive and non-invasive infections in children. In areas with high vaccination coverage, universal infant vaccination with conjugated pneumococcal vaccine (PCV) has significantly decreased the incidence of vaccine type nasopharyngeal carriage and invasive pneumococcal disease. The aim of this study is to examine immunization coverage rate and timely administration of the recently introduced PCV and compare to the established diphtheria-tetanus-acellular pertussis vaccine (DTaP) with similar schedule.
   Methods: A stratified random sample of healthy infants and children 6-36 months of age were recruited. Demographic data were collected from parents. Among enrolled children, immunization status for DTaP and PCV was noted from the child's health booklet.
   Results: Of 1105 children enrolled in the study, 586 (53%) were vaccinated in the private sector and the rest in the public sector. A significant higher proportion of children vaccinated at the private sector were fully vaccinated for PCV (71% versus 58%, p < 0.05) while no difference in the DTaP coverage was observed. Conversely, the compliance to the recommended vaccination schedule was much higher in the public sector for the first and second dose of PCV and second dose of DTaP.
   The overall, timely administration was higher for the DTaP vaccine when compared to PCV (p < 0.05).
   Moreover, adherence to the program was higher for the firstborn child of the family while significant differences were observed between different geographic regions. Interestingly, co-administration of DTaP and PCV was observed in only 2% of the children.
   Conclusion: In children residing in Cyprus, vaccination coverage and adherence to PCV vaccination schedule are significantly lower compared to the established DTaP vaccine. There is an urgent need for increasing the overall vaccination coverage as well as improving the adherence to vaccination schedule. Possible interventions are proposed. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Toxoplasma gondii rhoptry protein 18 (ROP18) and microneme protein 8 (MIC8) are important invasion factors that mediate parasite multiplication. The main objective of this study was to determine the immunogenicity and efficacy by virus-like particle (VLP) vaccines of T. gondii ROP18 VLPs and MIC8 VLPs in combination or individuals. Mice were intranasally immunized with single ROP18 VLPs or MIC8 VLPs, or a combination of ROP18 VLP5 and MIC8 VLPs followed by challenge with T. gondii tachyzoites (GT1) through intraperitoneal injection or challenge with T. gondii (ME49) through oral infection. Vaccination with a combination of ROP18 VLPs and MIC8 VLP5 resulted in more potent effects on inducing parasite neutralizing activity, memory T cell response, and reducing parasite burden compared to single VLP vaccination. Lower levels of inflammatory cytokines (IFN-gamma, IL-6) and apoptosis responses were observed with VLP vaccine combination after challenge. These results suggest that VLP vaccines presenting both T. gondii ROP18 and MIC8 antigens confer enhanced protection compared to a single VLPs vaccine, and VLP platforms could be developed as potential vaccines against toxoplasmosis.

AB Background: In the current transmission, we studied the immunogenicity and protective efficacy of serotypes 22F and 33F in the prevention of colonization and of invasive Streptococcus pneumoniae (Spn) pathogenesis during an influenza co-infection. Serotypes 22F and 33F are emerging Spn serotypes, which are not part of currently administered pneumococcal conjugate vaccine formulations (PCVs). Spn serotype 6A is an ingredient in the currently administered PCV13 vaccine and was therefore included in the study as a control.
   Methods: Adult (six weeks) and infant (two weeks) C57BL/6 mice were intranasally infected in the nasopharynx (NP) with Spn serotypes 22F, 33F, or 6A. Influenza A H1N1 A/Puerto Rico/8/193 virus (PR8) was introduced one day after the NP Spn colonization. In an immunization challenge study, mice were vaccinated with monovalent 22F, 33F, or 6A polysaccharide conjugated to the CRM 197 antigen. The immunized mice were colonized or co-infected to study the vaccines efficacy.
   Results: All three Spn serotypes established colonization in adult and infant mice. The co-infected mice showed an increase in Spn NP density. Invasive Spn infection (bacteremia) was observed following the co-infection with serotypes 22F and 6A but not 33F in adult mice, whereas infant mice developed bacteremia following co-infection with all three Spn serotypes. The vaccinations led to robust serum antibody responses to capsular polysaccharides 22F, 6A, and less for 33F. The vaccinations resulted in reductions of Spn NP colonization density for all three serotypes, prevention of bacteremia, and increased survival with Spn serotypes 22F and 6A. Passive transfer of antisera was associated with a reduction of Spn colonization densities in infant mice.
   Conclusion: Vaccinations with monovalent 22F, 33F, or 6A formulations protect against Spn colonization, and the efficacy of the 22F vaccination was comparable to the 6A vaccination in preventing an invasive Spn bacterial infection during an influenza co-infection.

AB Recombination is closely linked with virus replication and is an important mechanism that contributes to genome diversification and evolution in alphaherpesviruses. Infectious laryngotracheitis (ILTV; Gallid alphaherpesvirus 1) is an alphaherpesvirus that causes respiratory disease in poultry. In the past, natural (field) recombination events between different strains of ILTV generated virulent recombinant viruses that have caused severe disease and economic loss in poultry industries. In this study, chickens were vaccinated with attenuated ILTV vaccines to examine the effect of vaccination on viral recombination and diversity following subsequent co-inoculation with two field strains of ILTV. Two of the vaccines (SA2 and A20) prevented ILTV replication in the trachea after challenge, but the level of viral replication after co-infection in birds that received the Serva ILTV vaccine strain did not differ from that of the mock-vaccinated (control) birds. Even though the levels of viral replication were similar in the two groups, the number of recombinant progeny viruses and the level of viral diversity were significantly lower in the Serva-vaccinated birds than in mock-vaccinated birds. In both the mock-vaccinated and Serva-vaccinated groups, a high proportion of recombinant viruses were detected in naive in-contact chickens that were housed with the co-inoculated birds. Our results indicate that vaccination can limit the number and diversity of recombinant progeny viruses in a manner that is independent of the level of virus replication. It is possible that immune responses induced by vaccination can select for virus genotypes that replicate well under the pressure of the host immune response. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Candida albicans is a common commensal and opportunistic fungal pathogen in human, which poses threat to human health, especially in immunocompromised patients. Unfortunately, few effective prophylactic and therapeutic strategies were applied to clinic practice. Recently, the peptide YGKDVKDLFDYAQE from Fructose-bisphosphate aldolase 1 (Fba1), as a vaccine, was reported to induce protection effects against systemic candidiasis. Here, we displayed this epitope peptide on the coat proteins (pIII or pVIII) of filamentous phage, and investigated their protective effects against C albicans infections. Mice were immunized with recombinant phages (designated as phage-3F and phage-8F) or protein (rFba1), then challenged with C. albicans yeast cells via lateral tail vein. Results demonstrated that the recombinant phages as well as rFba1 apparently induced humoral and cellular immune responses, reduced fungal burden and relieved kidney damage in infected mice and significantly improved their survival rates. Briefly, all these findings indicated that the recombinant phages displaying the epitope YGKDVKDLFDYAQE have the potential to be developed into a new vaccine against C. albicans infections.

AB To clarify the protective effect of one-dose mumps-containing vaccines (MuCV) in mainland China, the antigenic variations of HN gene and cross-neutralization capacities between MuCV and wild type genotype F MuVs were studied. In total, 70 HN gene sequences of genotype F MuV representative strains obtained from 2001 to 2015, two types of MuCV strains, 139 pairs of pre- and post-vaccination serum samples from infants receiving one dose of MuCV vaccination were analyzed. Genotype-specific amino acid variations were observed in the potential antigenic epitopes between MuCV and wild-type genotype F MuVs circulating in mainland China. The mumps neutralization antibody titers induced by one-dose MuCV were found to be generally low. Moreover, significant differences in neutralization titers were observed between vaccine and wild-type strains. It could be concluded that one-dose MuCV had a cross-protective effect against the wild-type genotype F MuVs, but its effectiveness was limited, which might be caused by insufficient doses of MuCV vaccination and the genotype-specific antigenic differences between vaccine and wild-type MuVs as well. In addition, a poor linear correlation between mumps-specific IgG concentrations and neutralization titers was observed in this study, indicating the concentration of MuV-specific IgG could not fully reflect the neutralizing antibody titer in serum. Therefore, it is highly recommended to provide a second dose of MuCV to preschool children to increase MuV neutralizing antibody titers and use MuV cross-neutralization test as preferred tool for assessment of mumps-containing vaccine effectiveness on wild-type MuVs. This is the first report to assess the effectiveness of one-dose Chinese MuCV against wild-type genotype F MuVs, which would be benefit for the development of mumps vaccination strategy.

AB Background: Third doses of measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine have been administered during mumps outbreaks and in various non-outbreak settings. The immunogenicity of the rubella component has not been evaluated following receipt of a third dose of MMR vaccine.
   Methods: Young adults aged 18-31 years with documented two doses of MMR vaccine received a third dose of MMR vaccine between July 2009 and October 2010. Rubella neutralizing antibody titers were assessed before, 1 month, and 1 year after receipt of a third dose of MMR vaccine.
   Results: Among 679 participants, 1.8% had rubella antibody titers less than 10 U/ml, immediately before vaccination, approximately 15 years after receipt of a second dose of MMR vaccine. One month after receipt of a third dose of MMR vaccine, average titers were 4.5 times higher and >50% of participants had a 4-fold boost. Response was highest among those with titers less than 10 U/ml prior to vaccination (geometric mean titer ratio = 18.8; 92% seroconversion) and decreased with increasing pre-vaccination titers. Average titers declined 1 year postvaccination but remained significantly higher than pre-vaccination levels. The proportion classified as low-positive antibody levels increased from 3% 1 month postvaccination to 24% 1 year postvaccination.
   Conclusions: Vaccination with a third dose of MMR vaccine resulted in a robust boosting of rubella neutralizing antibody response that remained elevated 1 year later. Young adults with low rubella titers are more likely to benefit from a third dose of MMR vaccine. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Determination of protein concentration in vaccines containing aluminum salt adjuvant typically necessitates desorption of the protein prior to analysis. Here we describe a method based on the intrinsic fluorescence of tyrosine and tryptophan that requires no desorption of proteins. Adjuvanted formulations of three model Bordetella pertussis antigens were excited at 280 nm and their emission spectra collected from 290 to 400 nm. Emission spectra of protein antigens in the presence of aluminum salt adjuvants were able to be detected, the effects of adjuvants on the spectra were analyzed, and linear regressions were calculated. The fluorescence method proved to be very sensitive with a limit of quantification between 0.4 and 4.4 mu g/mL and limit of linearity between 100 and 200 mu g/mL, across the formulations tested. The fluorescence method was found to be influenced by adjuvant presence, type of adjuvant, adjuvant concentration, buffer and pH conditions. The method also demonstrated ability to monitor the percent adsorption of antigens to the adjuvants. Furthermore, intrinsic fluorescence showed good correlation with micro-Kjeldahl elemental assay in quantifying protein concentration. Being a non-invasive, quick and sensitive method, intrinsic fluorescence has the potential to be utilized as a high throughput tool for vaccine development and conceivably implemented in-line, using in-line fluorimeters, to monitor antigen concentration during formulation processing.

ID HPV VACCINATION; GIRLS; NETHERLANDS; PREDICTORS
AB Background: The human papillomavirus vaccine (HPV vaccine) was introduced into the Danish Childhood Vaccination Programme in 2009. Following a national debate questioning the safety of the vaccine, the coverage decreased from an uptake of >90% for the first dose of the HPV vaccine to an uptake of 52% in girls born in 2003. The aim of this study was to identify changes in determinants for HPV vaccine hesitancy in the period when the debate spiraled and to identify determinants for specific hesitancy towards the HPV vaccine among girls who received the second dose of the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine.
   Methods: We included girls born in the period 1999-2003 who were residing in Denmark between their 12th and 13th birthday (n = 161,528). Data from the Danish Vaccination Register were linked with demographic data from the Danish Civil Registration System. We used multiple logistic regression models to identify associations between determinants and the uptake of the first dose of the HPV vaccine (HPV1 ).
   Results: For girls born in 1999-2000, low uptake was seen in children of increasing birth order, young or old age of mother, non-Danish origin, low uptake of other childhood vaccines, and in girls living with one parent. For girls born in 2001-2003, most of these determinants of low uptake became less significant. Birth order and origin showed different tendencies when comparing birth cohorts 1999-2000 with birth cohorts 2001-2003.
   Conclusions: We found demographic disparities in the uptake of HPVI that were generally in line with existing literature. More importantly, the results indicate that determinants for hesitancy towards the HPV vaccines changed during a period of intense public debate regarding the safety of the HPV vaccine. This may indicate that the public concerns over safety disproportionally affect those who trusted vaccines prior to the debate. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Objectives: To evaluate the effectiveness of post-exposure prophylaxis conducted during varicella outbreaks among students in Shanghai.
   Methods: Surveillance data were collected from September 1, 2013 to December 31, 2016 involving 3524 susceptible students in 109 primary and middle school classes where emergency vaccinations (EVs) had been administered. Students were divided into two groups according to their prior vaccination (PV) varicella vaccine status. A secondary attack rate was used to compare EV and non-EV groups using a chi-squared test. Stratification analyses were performed, adjusting for the EV administration date, the vaccination coverage rate, and the number of cases prior to the EV.
   Results: The effectiveness rate was 92.2% (95% confidence interval (CI): 37.1-99.0%) when EV was applied within 3 days following the outbreak onset date, and 95.2% (95% Cl: 79.9-98.8%) when vaccination coverage was >= 80% among students with PV. When students with PV received an EV for varicella within 3 days, the effectiveness rate was 100%.
   Conclusions: EV showed high protective effectiveness for varicella during outbreaks, especially if administered within 3 days of an outbreak and in conjunction with a high coverage rate. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Introduction: Vietnam is implementing hepatitis B (HBV) birth dose (BD) vaccination since 2003 but coverage remains low, especially in the Mekong River Delta. This study aimed to determine the coverage of the HBV BD vaccination, to identify socio-demographic factors influencing HBV BD, and to assess reasons for non-immunization of neonates.
   Methods: A cross sectional survey was conducted in 2015-2016. Mothers from 526 children aged 6-11 months living in 3 provinces in the Mekong River Delta - representing respectively urban, rural and remote area - were interviewed at home and infant vaccination documents were checked. The three-stage sampling method was adapted from WHO 30-cluster sampling. Predictors of HBV BD administration were identified with multiple regression analysis.
   Results: The overall HBV BD coverage (within 24 h) was 46.6% (compared to 44.5% for BCG) and was significantly higher in remote or rural than in urban area (OR 1.87 and 3.36, respectively), and in children whose father had a higher educational level (OR 2.76; 2.29 and 1.86, respectively, for master degree, bachelor and secondary school) as compared to a lower level. Main reasons for not having received HBV BD mentioned by parents were vaccines not offered by health care workers (53.0%), and illness of the infant (27.2%).
   Conclusion: Although Vietnam started HBV BD vaccination more than 10 years ago, the coverage and timeliness need to improve to reach WHO targets (95% within 24 h after birth). Better training and information of health care workers, and better protocols ensuring timely HBV BD could address these vaccine administration thresholds. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background: The objective of this study was to estimate influenza vaccine effectiveness (VE) for the 2016/17 epidemic of co-circulating influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and A(H3N2) viruses in Beijing, the capital of China.
   Methods: The surveillance-based study included all swabbed patients through influenza virological surveillance, between November 2016 and April 2017. A test-negative case-control design was used to estimate influenza VE against medically-attended laboratory-confirmed influenza in outpatient settings. Cases were influenza-like illness (ILI) patients who tested positive for influenza, and controls were influenza negative patients.
   Results: A total of 10,496 ILI patients were enrolled and swabbed. Among them, 735 tested positive for influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, 1851 for A(H3N2), and 40 for type B. Of the 45 randomly selected specimens out of 1851 influenza A(H3N2) viruses, 2(4.4%) belonged to the H3N2 3C.2a1 Glade, and 43(95.6%) belonged to A/Hong Kong/4801/2014-like 3C.2a Glade. Among the 43 viruses of the 3C.2a clade, 32 viruses clustered in one subgroup carrying T131K, R142K and R261Q substitutions. The adjusted VE against all influenza was low at 25% (95% confidence interval (CI): 0-43%), with 54% (95%CI: 22-73%) for influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, and 2% (95%CI: -35% to 29%) for influenza A(H3N2).
   Conclusions: Our study suggested a moderate VE against influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, but low VE against influenza A(H3N2) in Beijing, 2016/17 season. Amino acid substitutions in the hemagglutinin may contribute to the low VE against influenza A(H3N2) for this season. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background: The potency of live viral vaccines decreases over time. We compared the immunogenicity and safety of GSK measles-mumps-rubella vaccine (MMR-RIT) formulations at two different potencies with that of the commercially-available MMR II formulation.
   Methods: In this phase III observer-blind clinical study (NCT01681992), 4516 healthy children aged 12-15 months were randomized (1:1:1 ratio) to receive one dose of MMR-RIT at the minimum potency used for this study (MMR-RIT-Min) or MMR-RIT at the second lowest potency used for this study (MMRRIT-Med), or control MMR II vaccine. A second dose (MMR-RIT or MMR II) was administered 42 days after the first. The study had 10 co-primary objectives to evaluate MMR-RIT versus MMR II immunogenicity via a hierarchical procedure. Anti-measles and anti-rubella antibodies were measured by ELISA and antimumps antibodies by ELISA and unenhanced plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT).
   Results: Each formulation induced immune responses to all vaccine antigens after each MMR dose. While the primary objectives for MMR-RIT-Min were not met, MMR-RIT-Med induced immune responses as measured by ELISA against the three vaccine antigens that met pre-specified non-inferiority criteria. The immune response following MMR-RIT-Med against mumps measured by PRNT failed the non-inferiority criterion for seroresponse rate: the 97.5% confidence interval lower limit (-10.94%) was beyond the pre-defined limit of -10%. Immune responses were comparable among groups post-dose 2. No safety concerns were identified, and MMR-RIT and MMR II vaccines had similar reactogenicity and safety profiles.
   Conclusions: One dose of MMR-RIT formulation with lower potency (MMR-RIT-Med) induced a non-inferior immune response compared to commercial MMR II vaccine, measured by ELISA in one-year-old children. Non-inferiority was not demonstrated in terms of immune response against mumps virus measured by unenhanced PRNT, although the difference was of uncertain clinical relevance. After the second dose, immune responses were comparable among the MMR-RIT and MMR II groups. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Background: To assess if hepatitis B vaccination in adults is causally associated with autoimmune diseases. Such causation has been claimed based mainly on case reports and uncontrolled studies, and a syndrome 'Autoimmune/autoinflammatory Disorder Induced by Adjuvants' (ASIA) has been claimed to be linked to immunization, particularly hepatitis B vaccination.
   Methods: Review of peer-reviewed literature from January 1990 to March 2017 identifying controlled studies with documented incidence of autoimmune diseases occurring after hepatitis B vaccinations in adults. From 1297 studies identified, 259 were further assessed and 49 reviewed further; 19 relevant papers reporting 21 results are reviewed here, and 14 results included in a meta-analysis.
   Results: Overall no association between hepatitis B vaccination and the onset of autoimmune diseases was seen. The overall odds ratio was 1.06, with 95% confidence limits of 0.93-1.21, with nonsignificant heterogeneity. Only one study showed a significant excess risk between hepatitis B immunisation and autoimmune disease.
   Conclusions: Despite multiple case reports, there is no reliable scientific evidence of autoimmune diseases being caused by hepatitis B vaccinations. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Antibiotic-resistant pathogens have become a major public health problem worldwide. New discoveries and strategies as regards antibiotic drug development are urgently in need for curing infected patients. Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are short cationic peptides that play important roles in innate immune system with a broad spectrum of antimicrobial activity. Recently, hybrid AMPs have been reported to increase antimicrobial activity, stability, and in vivo half-life. In the present study, a gene encoding for AL32-P113 hybrid peptide consisting of two truncated active forms of human LL-37 and histatin-5 (Hst-5) was commercially constructed, cloned into pTXB-1 commercial plasmid, and expressed in E. coli BL21 (DE3). To increase the yield of target protein expression, IPTG concentration, time and temperature were optimized. The results indicate that AL32-P113-intein fusion protein with 33.7 kDa was expressed mostly in inclusion form and estimated to be 20% of the total protein. After chitin affinity purification, 5.7-kDa of AL32-P113 peptide was separated with an average concentration of 12.1 mg per litre of bacterial culture and over 86% purity. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was evaluated for antimicrobial activity determination of recombinant AL32-P113 compared to synthetic peptides, LL-37, Hst-5, and L31-P113. The results implied that both hybrid peptides exhibited potent antimicrobial activity against gram-negative bacteria and yeast cells whereas the L31-P113 peptide possessed approximately four times greater antimicrobial activity in gram-positive bacteria than parent LL-37. An increasing of undesired hemolysis of these hybrid peptides toward human red cells was also observed when red blood cell hemolytic assay was performed. Several factors including charge and secondary structure predicted by public software were utilized for explanation of the antimicrobial potency of both hybrid peptides. This study proved that hybrid peptides show broader and more potent antimicrobial ability against pathogens and they could be applied as a therapeutic approach for topical treatment of microbial infection in the future.

ID 3-DIMENSIONAL DIFFERENTIATION
AB Pancreatic differentiation of stem cells will aid treatment of patients with type I diabetes mellitus (T1DM). Synthetic biopolymers utilization provided extracellular matrix (ECM) and desired attributes in vitro to enhance conditions for stem cells proliferation, attachment and differentiation. A mixture of polycaprolactone and polyvinyl alcohol (PCL/PVA)-based scaffold, could establish an in vitro three-dimensional (3D) culture model. The objective of this study was investigation of the human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) differentiation capacity to insulin-producing cells (IPCs) in 3D culture were compared with conventional culture (2D) groups evaluated at the mRNA and protein levels by quantitative PCR and immunofluorescence assay, respectively. The functionality of differentiated IPCs was assessed by C-peptide and insulin release in response to glucose stimulation test. Real-Time PCR results showed that iPSCs-IPCs expressed pancreas-specific transcription factors (Insulin, Pdxl, Glucagon, Glut2 and Ngn3). The expressions of these transcription factors in PCL/PVA scaffold were higher than 2D groups. In addition to IPCs specific markers were detected by immunochemistry. These cells in both groups secreted insulin and C-peptide in a glucose challenge test by ELISA showing in vitro maturation. The results of current study demonstrated that enhanced differentiation of IPCs from hiPSCs could be result of PCL/PVA nanofibrous scaffolds. In conclusion, this research could provide a new approach to beta like cells replacement therapies and pancreatic tissue engineering for T1DM in the future.

AB The molecular pathways activated in response to acute cathepsin G (CG) exposure, as well as the mechanisms involved in activation of signaling pathways that culminate in myocyte detachment and apoptosis remain unclear. This study aimed to determine the changes in gene expression patterns associated with time dependent CG exposure to neonatal rat cardiomyocytes (NRCMs). Microarray analysis revealed a total of 451, 572 and 1127 differentially expressed genes after CG exposure at 1, 4 and 8 h respectively. A total of 54 overlapped genes at each time point were mapped by Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA). The top up-regulated genes included Hamp, SMAD6, NR4A1, FOSL2, ID3 and SLAMF7, and down-regulated genes included CYR61, GDF6, Olr640, Vom2r36, DUSP6 and MMP20. Our data suggest that there are multiple deregulated pathways associated with cardio-myocyte death after CG exposure, including JAK/Stat signaling, IL-9 signaling and Nur77 signaling. In addition, we also generated the molecular network of expressed gene and found most of the molecules were connected to ERK1/2, caspase, BCR (complex) and Cyclins. Our study reveals the ability to assess time-dependent changes in gene expression patterns in NRCMs associated with CG exposure. The global gene expression profiles may provide insight into the cellular mechanism that regulates CG dependent myocyte apoptosis. In future, the pathways important in CG response, as well as the genes found to be differentially expressed might represent the therapeutic targets for myocyte survival in heart failure.

AB Neuropeptides and peptide hormones play central roles in the regulation of various types of insect physiology and behavior. Artificial light at night, a form of environmental stress, has recently been regarded as a source of light stress on nocturnal insects. Because related genomic information is not available, molecular biological studies on the response of neuropeptides in nocturnal insects to light stress are limited. Based on the de novo sequencing of the Helicoverpa armigera head transcriptome, we obtained 124,960 unigenes. Of these, the number of unigenes annotated as neuropeptides and peptide hormones, neurotransmitter precursor processing enzymes, and neurotransmitter receptors were 34, 17, and 58, respectively. Under light stress, there were sex-specific differences in gene expression measured by qRT-PCR. The IMFamide, leucokinin and sNPF genes were differentially expressed at the mRNA level in males but not in females in response to light stress. The results provide new insights on the diversity of the neuropeptide transcriptional network of H. armigera. In addition, some neuropeptides exhibited sex-specific differential expression in response to light stress. Taken collectively, these results not only expand the catalog of known insect neuropeptides but also provide a framework for future functional studies on the physiological roles they play in the light stress response behavior of nocturnal moths.

AB The ruminant casein gene family (CSNs, link as CSN1S1-CSN2-CSNIS2-CSN3) is characterized by diverse variations and has been extensively studied for ruminant milk traits, however, studies on insertion/deletion (indel) mutations within this gene family and their effects on prolificacy are extremely limited. This study aimed to detect possible novel indels within CSNs in an indigenous Chinese goat breed-Shaanbei White Cashmere goat (SBWC, n = 3047) and four other Chinese goat breeds (n = 1136) with varied litter size rates (105%-283%) and different estrus types (seasonal vs. perennial), as well as exploring the association between these potential indels and litter size. Only one novel 11-bp indel within the CSN1S1 gene was found. The association analyses uncovered that this novel indel was related to the first-birth litter size of SBWC population (n = 2690) (P < 1.0 E-8). Individuals with the II genotype (n = 676) had the best litter size when compared with those ID genotype (n = 1098) and DD genotype (n = 916) individuals. Animals with the II genotype were found to have higher relative expression level of CSNIS1 gene in the ovary (P < 0.01). Besides, Chi-square tests for different litter size and estrous cycle breeds showed that perennial-estrus breeds and multi-kids breeds had higher "I" allelic frequencies and "II" genotypic frequencies. These findings suggest the 11-bp indel within the CSN1S1 gene is significantly associated with reproduction traits and can be an effective molecular marker for litter size of goat breeding.

AB Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are a group of non-protein-coding RNAs that are generated from back-splicing. Recent evidence indicates that circRNAs play important roles in tissue development, gene regulation, and carcinogenesis. It was recently demonstrated that circular RNAs can function as sponges for miRNAs. In our study, the clinical implications of circRNF13 were assessed in 50 pathologically diagnosed lung adenocarcinoma samples and their paired peripheral normal lung tissues by using quantitative polymerase chain reaction. We validated that circRNF13 was almost 2.98-fold down-regulated in cancer tissues. The expression level of circRNF13 was significantly negatively correlated with TNM staging and lymph node metastasis. In vitro experiments indicated that circRNF13 repressed the invasion and metastasis of lung adenocarcinoma cell lines. Cell fraction analyses and fluorescence in situ hybridization detected that circRNF13 was mostly located in the cytoplasm. Bioinformatic analyses and RIP experiments revealed that circRNF13 could interact with Ago2, an RNA binding protein, and could function as sponge for miR-93-5p. Our data suggest that circRNF13 represents a potential novel biomarker and a therapeutic target of lung adenocarcinoma.

AB Changes in cell wall structure of four strains of Sacccharomyces cerevisiae species (brewer's, baker's and probiotic yeast) after culturing on deproteinated potato juice water (DPJW) with diverse addition of glycerol and different pH were investigated. It allowed to select conditions intensifying biosynthesis of beta(1,3)/(1,6)-glucan and mannoproteins of cell walls of tested strains. Yeast cell wall structural polysaccharides show biological activity and technological usability in food industry but also decide about therapeutic properties of yeast biomass. The highest increase in the thickness of walls (by about 100%) and beta-glucan layer (by about 120%) was stated after cultivation of S. cerevisiae R9 brewer's yeast in DPJW supplemented with 5 and 10% (w/v) of glycerol and pH 7.0 while S. cerevisiae var. boulardi PAN yeast synthesized by ab. 70% thicker beta-glucan layer when the pH of growth medium was equal to 5.0. The cells of brewer's yeast (S. cerevisiae R9), probiotic (S. cerevisiae CNCM 1-745) and baker's (S. cerevisiae 102) intensified the ratio of mannoproteins in the structure of cell walls cultivated in mediums supplemented with above 15% of glycerol what point out the protective action of glycoprotein's under osmotic stress conditions. The study confirms at the first time the possibility of using agro-industrial waste in biosynthesis of functional polysaccharides of S. cerevisiae cell wall. It could be an new advantage in production of yeast biomass with therapeutic properties or beta-glucan preparation as a novel food ingredient.

AB We report on the use of the polyethylenimine-based (PEI) sorbents for immobilization and harvesting of microalgae (MA) cells. Specific materials assessed were porous solid polymers from highly-branched PEI synthesized by cross-linking with epichlorohydrin (ECH) or diethylene glycol diglycidyl ether (DGDE). We estimated the effect of PEI/cross-linker ratio on the MA attachment and biocompatibility of the sorbents with the MA cells. A decrease in the cross-linker percentage resulted in the enhancement of the immobilization efficiency but impaired the cell viability as was manifested by inhibition of the photosynthetic activity of the MA cells. The rate of Chlorella vulgaris cell attachment to the sorbents with ECH was faster as compared to that of the PEI-DGDE-based polymers. The cells immobilized on the PEI-ECH sorbents showed a more profound decline in their viability (assessed via photosynthetic activity). The sorbents with 60% of DGDE were characterized by high immobilization efficiency. These sorbents supported a prolonged cultivation of the immobilized MA without impairing their viability and metabolic activity. We conclude that the sorbents with a lower percentage of DGDE (< 30%) and sorbents with ECH are suitable for harvesting of the MA cells intended for immediate downstream processing, potentially without the cell desorption. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on successful application of PEI-based sorbents in microalgal biotechnology.

AB Lignin is one of the major components of lignocellulose biomass and chemically degrades into phenolic aldehydes including 4-hydroxybenzaldehyde, vanillin, and syringaldehyde. No lipid accumulation from the phenolic aldehydes by oleaginous microbes had been succeeded. Compared with vanillin and syringaldehyde, T. cutaneum ACCC 20271 have better tolerance to 4-hydroxybenzaldehyde. 4-Hydroxybenzaldehyde was found to be able as the substrate for lipid accumulation, while vanillin and syringaldehyde were only converted to less toxic phenolic alcohols and acids without observable lipid accumulation, perhaps due to the space shelling of methoxyl group(s) in the structures. A long term fed batch fermentation of 4-hydroxybenzaldehyde accumulated 0.85 g L-1 of lipid, equivalent to 0.039 g lipid per gram of 4-hydroxybenzaldehyde substrate, approximately 3.7 folds greater than the control without 4-hydroxybenzaldehyde addition. The fatty acid composition well met the need for biodiesel synthesis. The preliminary pathway from 4-hydroxybenzaldehyde to lipid was predicted. This study took the first experimental trial on utilizing phenolic aldehydes as the sole carbon sources for microbial lipid accumulation by T. cutaneum ACCC 20271.

AB Various nanoflowers are synthesized as supports for different methods of enzyme immobilization; however, the activities of these immobilized enzymes are limited because of their confinement in the nanoflowers. In order to increase the performance of nanoflowers, in this study, different protein-phosphate hybrid nanostructures were successfully synthesized and further enhanced by carbon nanotubes (CNTs) under the same conditions. Only Cu-3(PO4)(2) complex nanostructures exhibited flower-like structures and showed excellent results after enhancement with CNTs in this framework. An esterification reaction between lauric acid and 1-dodecanol was used to test enzyme activity during immobilization, revealing that the Cu-3(PO4)(2)/CNT/protein complex exhibited 68-fold higher activity relative to free lipase and 51-fold higher than that of Cu-3(PO4)(2)/Burkholderia cepacia lipase hybrid nanoflowers in the absence of CNTs. All three hybrid nanostructures showed good performance and exhibited excellent reusability in resolution reactions between 1-phenylethanol and vinyl acetate. Additionally, the substrate enantiomeric excess (ee(s)) reached 98% in only 10 min, and the corresponding Cu-3(PO4)(2)/CNT/protein complex could be recycled eight times without obvious loss of activity. This approach involving nanoflowers enhanced with CNTs will be highly beneficial for decreasing mass-transfer resistance and providing enhanced enzyme loading along with promising potential for industrial application.

AB As a bioactive triterpenoid, squalene is widely used in the food industry, cosmetics, and pharmacology. Squalene's major commercial sources are the liver oil of deep-sea sharks and plant oils. In this study, we focused on the enhancement of squalene biosynthesis in Yarrowia lipolytica, with particular attention to the engineering of acetyl-CoA metabolism based on genome-scale metabolic reaction network analysis. Although the overexpression of the rate-limiting endogenous ylHMG1 (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase gene) could improve squalene synthesis by 3.2-fold over that by the control strain, the availability of the key intracellular precursor, acetyl-CoA, was found to play a more significant role in elevating squalene production. Analysis of metabolic networks with the newly constructed genome-scale metabolic model of Y. lipolytica iYL_2.0 showed that the acetyl-CoA pool size could be increased by redirecting carbon flux of pyruvate dehydrogenation towards the ligation of acetate and CoA or the cleavage of citrate to form oxaloacetate and acetyl-CoA. The overexpression of either acetyl-CoA synthetase gene from Salmonella enterica (acs*) or the endogenous ATP citrate lyase gene (ylACL1) resulted in a more than 50% increase in the cytosolic acetyl-CoA level. Moreover, iterative chromosomal integration of the ylHMG1, asc*, and ylACL1 genes resulted in a significant improvement in squalene production (16.4-fold increase in squalene content over that in the control strain). We also found that supplementation with 10mM citrate in a flask culture further enhanced squalene production to 10 mg/g DCW. The information obtained in this study demonstrates that rationally engineering acetyl-CoA metabolism to ensure the supply of this key metabolic precursor is an efficient strategy for the enhancement of squalene biosynthesis.

AB A self-assembling peptide (27PEP) was isolated from an open reading frame (ORF). The ORF consisted of an unknown functional domain and a catalytic (lipolytic and phospholipolytic) domain (MPlaG) on metagenomic fosmid clone. This extension of 27 amino acids prior to the N-terminus of the catalytic domain (27PEP-MPlaG), starting at Met(261), produced an aggregate of high molecular weight (> 700 kDa). Compared with MPlaG, 27PEP-MPlaG showed the same temperature and pH effect for maximum activity but was stable in the presence of inhibitors such as EDTA and PMSF. The 27PEP-MPlaG exhibited lower specific activity than that of MPlaG, but when pre-incubated for 30 min at temperatures between 4 and 100 degrees C, its activity increased at temperatures greater than 40 degrees C under alkaline conditions and eventually reached the specific activity level of MPlaG at 60 degrees C. We experimentally determined that the aggregate caused by 27PEP was dissociated at elevated temperatures resulting in an active catalytic monomer. The 27PEP-indued aggregation may be attractive as application tool for improving or engineering of biocatalysts and biomaterials.

AB 4-vinylguaiacol, a kind of volatile phenolic compound with tobacco flavor, is widely used as a component of edible flavor and intermediate of medicine. Ferulic acid is usually used as substrate for the biosynthesis of 4-vinylguaiacol. However, the price of ferulic acid is high, leading to high production cost. In this study, a feasible low-cost process for the production of 4-vinylguaiacol was developed. The ultrasonic assisted weak alkali was used to extract protein from rice bran, and waste liquid and residue were then mixed to extract crude ferulic acid by alkaline hydrolysis. Subsequently crude ferulic acid without further purification was directly converted into 4-vinylguaiacol via alginate-immo cells of the strain Bacillus licheniformis DLF-17056, which was newly isolated and highly active with ferulic acid conversion to 4-vinylguaiacol. 4-Vinylguaiacol could be produced up to 0.76 g/L from 1.0 g/L ferulic acid within 24 h biotransformation. Furthermore, the immobilized biocatalysts retained above 60% initial activity even after 8 times biotransformations. Thereby, it was assumed that our study would contribute to the industrial production of 4-vinylguaiacol from ferulic acid.

AB Ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) converts C5 ornithine into C4 putrescine, a monomer for polyamide synthesis. However, ODC also has minor activity towards cell metabolite C6 lysine and yields C5 cadaverine. The accumulation of cadaverine in the reaction solution causes increase in the operational cost of subsequent distillation process for putrescine purification. Here, to increase ODC substrate specificity toward ornithine over lysine, molecular modelling and protein network analysis, specifically k-clique community analysis, around the substrate tunnel were performed. This resulted in a mutant with two-fold increase in substrate specificity (ornithine versus lysine) without losing its original activity towards ornithine (k(cat)/K-M = 61.5 s(-1) mM(-1)), compared to the native enzyme. When this mutant was used for putrescine synthesis, 31.6 g/L putrescine (based on 51.5 g/L ornithine) titer was achieved, while 0.007 g/L (based on 2.57 g/L lysine) cadaverine was produced. This corresponds to four-fold decrease in cadaverine yield compared to the native ODC.

AB Pseudomonas sp. RU47 (RU47) is a rhizosphere-competent strain showing plant growth-promoting and bio-control activities. In this study, the genome sequence of strain RU47 was obtained and phylogenetic and comparative genome analyses were performed. Multilocus sequence analysis (MLSA) coupled with the calculation of average nucleotide identity (ANI) and in silico DNA-DNA hybridization (DDH) values suggested that strain RU47 belongs to the P. koreensis group of the P. fluorescens complex, but cannot be assigned to any known Pseudomonas species. Multiple genes and operons encoding functions that likely contribute to its previously reported high rhizosphere competence, biocontrol of Rhizoctonia solani and plant growth promotion in soils with reduced fertilization were identified. Putative genes and gene clusters for the production of hydrogen cyanide, cyclic lipopeptides, bacteriocins, siderophores, indole-3-acetic acid, spermidine, alkaline protease A, chitinase and beta-1,3-glucanase were identified, as well as loci associated with solubilization of inorganic phosphate. Several of these functions were also confirmed by in vitro testing. Distribution of putative genes and gene clusters that may contribute to the plant growth-promoting and biocontrol activities was largely similar among strains belonging to P. koreensis group, as revealed by comparative genome analysis. Data presented in this study further support the potential of RU47 for its application in agriculture and may be a valuable resource for further studies.

AB To improve the specific activity and catalytic efficiency of L-LcLDH1, an NADH-dependent allosteric L-lactate dehydrogenase from L. casei, towards phenylpyruvic acid (PPA), its directed modification was conducted based on the semi-rational design. The three variant genes, Lcldh1(Q88R), Lcldh1(I229A) and Lcldh1(T235G), were constructed by whole-plasmid PCR as designed theoretically, and expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3), respectively. The purified mutant, L-LcLDH1(Q88R) or L-LcLDH1(I229A), displayed the specific activity of 451.5 or 512.4 U/mg towards PPA, by which the asymmetric reduction of PPA afforded L-phenyllactic acid (PLA) with an enantiomeric excess (ee(p)) more than 99%. Their catalytic efficiencies (k(cat)/K-m) without D-fructose-1,6-diphosphate (D-FDP) were 4.8-and 5.2-fold that of L-LcLDH1. Additionally, the k(cat)/K-m values of L-LcLDH1(Q88R) and L-LcLDH1(I229A) with D-FDP were 168.4-and 8.5-fold higher than those of the same enzymes without D-FDP, respectively. The analysis of catalytic mechanisms by molecular docking (MD) simulation indicated that substituting I229 in L-LcLDH1 with Ala enlarges the space of substrate-binding pocket, and that the replacement of Q88 with Arg makes the inlet of pocket larger than that of L-LcLDH1.

AB Genetic engineering of cell lines and model organisms has been facilitated enormously by the CRISPR/Cas9 system. However, in cell lines it remains labor intensive and time consuming to obtain desirable mutant clones due to the difficulties in isolating the mutated clones and sophisticated genotyping. In this study, we have validated fluorescent protein reporter aided cell sorting which enables the isolation of maximal diversity in mutant cells. We further applied two spectrally distinct fluorescent proteins DsRed2 and ECFP as reporters for independent CRISPR/Cas9 mediated targeting, which allows for one-cell-one-well sorting of the mutant cells. Because of ultra-high efficiency of the CRISPR/Cas9 system with dual reporters and large DNA fragment deletion resulting from independent loci cleavage, monoclonal mutant cells could be easily identified by conventional PCR. In the speed genome editing method presented here, sophisticated genotyping methods are not necessary to identify loss of function mutations after CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing, and desirable loss of function mutant clones could be obtained in less than one month following transfection.

AB Product degradation, such as clipping, is a common quality issue in the production of Fc-fusion proteins from Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. Degradation of proteins is mainly due to the action of either intracellular or extracellular host cell proteases. This study was carried out to understand more fundamentally the intracellular events that may play a role in determining why cell lines from the same cell line development project can vary with regards to the extent of Fc-fusion protein clipping. The cell lines that displayed the highest levels of clipping also produced less product than the cell lines with a lower level of clipping. In this study we applied differential quantitative label-free LC-MS/MS proteomic analysis to group clonally-derived cell lines (CDCLs) based on the level of clipping of the Fc-fusion protein. The analysis was carried out over two times points in culture and clones were designated as either having 'high' or 'low' clipping phenotypes. We have identified 200 differentially expressed proteins using quantitative label-free LC-MS/MS analysis between the two experimental groups. Functional assessment of the resultant proteomic data using Gene Ontology analysis showed a significant enrichment of biological processes and molecular functions related to protein folding, response to unfolded protein and protein translation. The levels of several proteases were also increased. This study identified protein targets that could be modified using cell line engineering approaches to improve the quality of recombinant Fc-fusion protein production in the biopharmaceutical industry.

AB For pre-clinical evaluation of biotherapeutic candidates, protein production by transient gene expression (TGE) in Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells offers important advantages, including the capability of rapidly and cost-effectively generating recombinant proteins that are highly similar to those produced in stable CHO clones. We have established a novel CHO clone (CHO-3E7) expressing a form of the Epstein-Barr virus nuclear antigen-1 (EBNA-1) with improved TGE productivity relative to parental CHO cells. Taking advantage of a new transfection-compatible media formulation that permits prolonged, high-density culture, we optimized transfection parameters (cell density, plasmid vector and polyethylenimine concentrations) and post-transfection culture conditions to establish a new, high-performing process for rapid protein production. The growth media is chemically defined, and a single hydrolysate feed is added post-transfection, followed by periodic glucose supplementation. This method gave significantly higher yields than our standard low-cell density, F17-based CHO-3E7 TGE method, averaging several hundred mg/l for a panel of recombinant proteins and antibodies. Purified antibodies produced using the two methods had distinct glycosylation profiles but showed identical target binding kinetics by SPR. Key advantages of this new protein production platform include the cost-effectiveness of the transfection reagent, the commercial availability of the culture media and the ability to perform high-cell-density transfection without media change.

AB Rotavirus infection of young children particularly below five years of age resulting in severe diarhoea, is the cause of a large number of infant deaths all over the world, more so in developing countries like India. Vaccines developed against this infection in the last two decades have shown mixed results with some of them leading to complications. Oral vaccines have not been very effective in India. Significant diversity has been found in circulating virus strains in India. Development of a vaccine against diverse genetic variants of the different strains would go a long way in reducing the incidence of infection in developing countries.
   Success of such a vaccine would depend to a large extent on the antigenic peptide to be used in antibody production. The non-glycosylated protein VP4 on the surface capsid of the virus is important in rota viral immunogenicity and the major antigenic site(s) responsible for neutralization of the virus via VP4 is in the VP8* subunit of VP4. It is necessary that the peptide should be very specific and a peptide sequence which would stimulate both the T and B immunogenic cells would provide maximum protection against the virus. Advanced computational techniques and existing databases of sequences of the VP4 protein of rotavirus help in identification of such specific sequences. Using an in silico approach we have identified a highly conserved VP8* subunit of the VP4 surface protein of rotavirus which shows both T and B cell processivity and is also non-allergenic. This sub-unit could be used in in vivo models for induction of antibodies.

AB Remote Infrared Matrix Assisted Laser Desorption Ionization (Remote IR MALDI) system (SpiderMass) with endogenous water as matrix allows to perform real-time DMPK in vivo. In this work, SpiderMass was used to analyze the impact on metabolite production or release of invalidated pro-protein PC1/3 macrophages by Short RNA (shRNA) versus scramble shRNA with Paclitaxel. Time course in vivo experiments were then performed on the inner and outer faces of patients' forearms or comedo treated with Melascreen (Ducray) containing ascorbyl glucoside. Finally, the impact of car pollution (emitted soot) on skin was also investigated. Taken together, we demonstrate that the SpiderMass instrument opens the door to clinical, pharmaceutical and environmental domains for real-time, in vivo pharmacokinetic (Drug Metabolism and PharmacoKinetics, DMPK) analysis.

AB Phospholipase D (PLD) was firstly hyperactivated by the bio-imprinting and, then, these hyperactivated PLD molecules were immobilized by adsorption and precipitation, followed by cross-linking. The high degree of conformational rigidification provided by intra-and intermolecular cross-linking can make PLD "remember" imprint-induced characteristics even in aqueous solutions. The obtained immobilized PLD showed the excellent catalytic performance. The maximum activity of immobilized PLD reached 166953 U/g(protein), which was approximately 14 times higher than that of free form (11922 U/g(protein)). Moreover, the selectivity of PLD was significantly enhanced after immobilization. The yield of PG and PA reached 94.0% and 5.96%, respectively. Compared with the serious hydrolysis in the free PLD (35.3% yield of PA), the side reaction was minimized in this work. This may be the first description of the remarkably high improvement of the activity and selectivity of PLD through the immobilization technology.

AB A novel method to synthesize poly(epsilon-caprolactone) (PCL) through a three-step, lipase-mediated chemo-enzymatic reaction from cyclohexanone using an immobilized lipase from Trichosporon laibacchii (T. laibacchii) CBS5791 was developed. The immobilized preparation with 1280 U.g(-1) used here was obtained by a method of purification and in situ immobilization where the crude intracellular lipase (cell homogenate) was subjected to partial purification by an aqueous two-phase system (ATPS) consisting of 12% (w/w) polyethylene glycol (PEG) 4000 and 13% (w/w) potassium phosphate (K2HPO4) and then in situ immobilization directly on diatomite from the top PEG-rich phase of ATPS. In this multi-step process, the epsilon-caprolactone (epsilon-CL) produced by lipase-mediated one-pot two-step chemo-enzymatic oxidation of cyclohexanone was directly subjected to in situ ring-opening polymerization (ROP) started by adding highly hydrophobic solvents. It is necessary to note that epsilon-CL synthesis and its subsequent ROP were catalyzed by the same lipase. The impact of various reaction parameters, e.g., solvent, cyclohexanone: hydrogen peroxide molar ratio, hydrogen peroxide forms and reaction temperature were investigated. Toluene was selected as a preferred solvent due to supporting the highest molecular weight (M-n = 2168) and moderate epsilon-CL conversion (65.42%). Through the optimization of reaction conditions, PCL was produced with a M-n of 2283 at 50 degrees C for 24 h. These results reveal that this lipase-mediated direct ring-opening polymerization of in situ formed epsilon-CL is an alternative route to the conventional synthesis of PCL.

AB Channelrhodopsins (ChRs) are a group of membrane proteins that allow cation flux across the cellular membrane when stimulated by light. They have been emerged as important tools in optogenetics where light is used to trigger a change in the membrane potential of live cells which induces downstream physiological cascades. There is also increased interest in their applications for generating light-responsive biomaterials. Here we have used a two-step screening protocol to develop a Pichia pastoris strain that produces superior yields of an enhance variant of CaChR2 (from Chlamydomonas reinhardtii), called ChIEF. We have also studied the effect of the cofactor, namely all-trans retinal (ATR), on the recombinant overexpression, folding, and function of the protein. We found that both ChIEF-mCitrine and CaChR2 can be overexpressed and properly trafficked to the plasma membrane in yeast regardless of the presence of the ATR. The purified protein was reconstituted into large unilamellar lipid vesicle using the detergent-assisted method. Using 9-amino-6-chloro-2-methoxyacridine (ACMA) as the fluorescent proton indicator, we have developed a flux assay to verify the light-activated proton flux in the ChIEF-mCitrine vesicles. Hence such vesicles are effectively light-responsive nano-compartments. The results presented in this work lays foundations for creating bio-mimetic materials with a light-responsive function using channelrhodopsins.

AB Transglutaminase from Streptomyces mobaraensis (MTG) is an important enzyme for numerous industrial applications. Recombinant production requires proteolytic activation of the zymogen. The study provides a convenient procedure for the preparation of the transglutaminase-activating metalloprotease (TAMP) in Escherichia coli. In contrast to wtTAMP, rTAMP exhibited the P domain of convertases as molecular mass of 55.7 kDa suggested. Protein integrity was beneficially influenced by 2-5mM CaCl2. Study of pH and temperature optima assigned rTAMP to the neutral metalloproteases, more heat-resistant than Dispase but not thermolysin. Zinc had no inhibiting effect but 3.1 mu M EDTA completely reduced activity of 5 nM TAMP. MTG, exceeding concentration of rTAMP by three orders of magnitude, was largely activated within few minutes. The kinetic parameters K-M (1.31 +/- 0.05 mM) and k(cat) (135 +/- 4.3 s(-1)), monitored by isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC), further highlighted catalytic efficiency (103,053 M-1 s(-1)) of rTAMP and rapid processing of MTG. ITC even revealed that inhibition of rTAMP by its intrinsic inhibitory protein SSTI was an enthalpy-driven process resulting in K-d of 199 +/- 37.9 nM. The production procedure of rTAMP in E. coli closes the gap between production and application of recombinant MTG and may enhance relevance of MTG-mediated reactions in pharmaceutical processes.

AB In order to increase application of cross-linked enzyme aggregates (CLEAs) in industry production, a novel micro-reactor system that included a rotating magnetic field (RMF), a micro-reactor and CLEAs with magnetic nanoparticles (M-CLEAs) was designed to synthesize butyl oleate. Result showed that the presence of RMF significantly increased the yield of butyl oleate and the maximum increment was 23%. The yield of butyl oleate was impacted by the dosage and distribution of M-CLEAs in micro-reactor. M-CLEAs showed good reusability, since the morphology and the second structure of protein of M-CLEAs did not show evident change after 4 operative cycles. Although the three-dimensional fluorescence of M-CLEAs showed shift in fluorescence intensity and the maximum emission wavelengths, the yield of butyl oleate was not affected. This study provides a novel design that realized efficient, convenient and continuous application of CLEAs in biosynthesis, and M-CLEAs also show good promises in industry production.

AB The enzymatic Pictet-Spengler (PS) reaction, catalyzed by Pictet-Spenglerase (PSase), is the feature of beta-carboline (beta C) alkaloid biosynthesis. NscbB is a rare microbial PSase discovered from a cryptic beta-carboline alkaloid biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC) in the Nocardiopsis synnemataformans DSM 44143 (kidney transplant patient derived) by homologous alignment with its well-characterized counterpart McbB. The biochemical analysis showed that NscbB could catalyze L-tryptophan (K-M = 89.64 +/- 8.69 mu M) and methylglyoxal (K-M = 147.70 +/- 16.38 mu M), without cofactors, to form the two beta C skeletons 1-acetyl-3-carboxy-beta-carboline and 1-acetyl-beta-carboline in vitro. Additionally, the heterologous expression of nscbB in E. coli BL21 (DE3) revealed the efficient bioproductivity of NscbB to bioproduce two beta C skeletons, 1-acetyl-3-carboxy-beta-carboline (5.5 mg/L) and 1-acetyl-beta-carboline (3.1 mg/L), within 16 h fermentation. These results demonstrate NscbB is a novel and practical microbial PSase, which is useful for future bioactive beta C alkaloid exploitation and development.

AB Chiral amino alcohols are compounds of pharmaceutical interest as they are building blocks of sphingolipids, antibiotics, and antiviral glycosidase inhibitors. Due to the challenges of chemical synthesis we recently developed two TK-TAm reaction cascades using natural and low cost feedstocks as substrates: a recycling cascade comprising of 2 enzymes and a sequential 3-step enzyme cascade yielding 30% and 1% conversion, respectively. In order to improve the conversion yield and aid the future host strain engineering for whole cell biocatalysis, we used a combination of microscale experiments and statistical experimental design. For this we implemented a full factorial design to optimise pH, temperature and buffer type, followed by the application of Response Surface Methodology for the optimisation of substrates and enzymes concentrations. Using purified enzymes we achieved 60% conversion for the recycling cascade and 3-fold improvement using the sequential pathway. Based on the results, limiting steps and individual requirements for host cell metabolic integration were identified expanding the understanding of the cascades without implementing extensive optimisation modelling. Therefore, the approach described here is well suited for optimising reaction conditions as well as defining the relative enzyme expression levels required for construction of microbial cell factories.

AB Fatty acids have a low permeability through the cell membrane. Therefore, the intracellular biotransformation of fatty acids can be slow due to supply limitations. The effects of expression level of the fatty acid transporter FadL in Escherichia coli on the biotransformations were investigated. The enhanced expression of FadL led to 5.5-fold increase of the maximum reaction rate V-max (i.e., 200 mu mol/min per g dry cells (200 U/g dry cells)) of the recombinant E. coli expressing a hydratase of Stenotrophomonas maltophilia in the periplasm with respect to hydration of oleic acid. The FadL expression level was also critical for oxidation of 12- and 10-hydroxyoctadecanoic acid by the recombinant E. coli expressing an alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) of Micrococcus luteus. In addition, the multistep biotransformation of ricinoleic acid into the ester (i.e., (Z)-11-(heptanoyloxy) undec-9-enoic acid) by the recombinant E. coli expressing the ADH of M. luteus and a Baeyer-Villiger monooxygenase of Pseudomonas putida KT2440 was 2-fold increased to 40 U/g dry cells with expression of FadL to an appropriate level. The FadL expression level is one of the critical factors to determine whole-cell biotransformation rates of not only long chain fatty acids but also hydroxy fatty acids. This study may contribute to whole-cell biocatalyst engineering for biotransformation of hydrophobic substances.

AB The awareness about implementing continuous processing for biopharmaceutical products has significantly increased throughout the recent years not only at developmental scale but also for phase I supply in clinical trial manufacturing. In this study, we focused on upscaling continuous protein A chromatography from lab to pilot scale using the Cadence (TM) BioSMB PD and the Cadence (TM) BioSMB Process 80 system, respectively. Additionally, we evaluated hardware and software capability whilst running the system for 10 days non-stop using feed from a perfusion bioreactor. In terms of product quality and removal of impurities, comparable data was obtained regarding lab scale and production scale. Compared to batch mode, productivity was increased by 400 to 500%. Furthermore, the system worked accurately during the whole trial, proving its potential for the implementation into a hybrid or an end-to-end continuous process.

AB Earlier, we showed that micro RNA-132 (miR-132) regulate the immediate early genes (IEGs) in the olfactory bulb (OB) of fruit bat Cynopterus sphinx during olfactory learning. This study was designed to examine whether the miR-132 regulate other proteins in OB during olfactory learning. To test this, miR-132 anti-sense oligo-deoxynucleotide (AS-ODN) was delivered to the OB and then trained to novel odor. The 2-dimensional gel electrophoresis analysis showed that inhibition of miR-132 altered olfactory training induced expression of 321 proteins. Further, liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis reveals the identity of differently expressed proteins such as phosphoribosyl transferase domain containing protein (PRTFDC 1), Sorting nexin-8 (SNX8), Creatine kinase B-type (CKB) and Annexin All (ANX A11). Among them PRTFDC 1 showing 189 matching peptides with highest sequence coverage (67.0%) and protein-protein interaction analysis showed that PRTFDC 1 is a homolog of hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase-1 (HPRT-1). Subsequent immunohistochemical analysis (IHC) showed that inhibition of miR-132 down-regulated HPRT expression in OB of C. sphinx. In addition, western blot analysis depicts that HPRT, serotonin transporter (SERT), N-methyl-D-asparate (NMDA) receptors (2A,B) were down-regulated, but not altered in OB of non-sense oligodeoxynucleotide (NS-ODN) infused groups. These analyses suggest that miR-132 regulates the process of olfactory learning and memory formation through SERT and NMDA receptors signalling, which is possibly associated with the PRTFDC1-HPRT interaction.

AB Background: Osteoporosis is a multifactorial disease with a strong genetic influence. Recent studies have demonstrated that cytokines, such as TGF-beta 1 and interleukin 6 (IL-6) play complex roles in the normal bone metabolism and pathophysiology of osteoporosis. Here, we investigated the roles of 2 polymorphisms mapping to the promoters of TGF-beta 1 and IL-6 genes on the genetic susceptibility to osteoporosis as well as calcium and vitamin D levels.
   Methods: A cohort of 297 elderly participants in northern Iran comprising 181 osteoporotic patients (mean age +/- SD, 68.36 +/- 7.21 years) and 116 unrelated healthy controls (mean age +/- SD, 64 +/- 5.44 years) was studied for TGF-beta 1(C-509T) and IL-6 (G-634C) polymorphisms using PCR-RFLP method.
   Results: A significant relationship was observed between calcium level and IL-6 genotypes in osteoporotic males (P = 0.011) and females (P = 0.020). No significant differences were observed between osteoporotic and control groups with respect to allele frequency or genotype distribution based on the 2 selected polymorphisms under different genetic models. The results remained the same after comparing the BMD values of either the femur neck or lumbar spine with the genotypes of the elderly men and women when analyzed separately.
   Conclusion: IL-6 genotype influences serum calcium levels in osteoporotic patients. The lack of association between the common genetic variations of TGF-B1 and IL-6 genes, and BMD highlights the complex genetic background of osteoporosis in the north of Iran.

AB Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease (ADPKD), the most frequent genetic disorder of the kidneys, is characterized by a typical presenting symptoms include cysts development in different organs and a non-cysts manifestations. ADPKD is caused by mutations in PKD1 or PKD2 genes. In this study, we aimed to search for molecular causative defects among PKD1 and PKD2 genes. Eighteen patients were diagnosed based on renal ultrasonography and renal/extra-renal manifestations. Then, Sanger sequencing was performed for PKD1 and PKD2 genes. Multiplex Ligation dependent Probe Amplification method (MLPA) methods was performed for both PKD genes. Mutational analysis of the PKD2 gene revealed the absence of variants and no deletions or duplications of both PKD genes were detected. But three novels mutations i.e. p.S463C exon 7; c. c.11156 + 2T > C IVS38 and c.8161-1G > A IVS22 and two previously reported c.1522T > C exon 7 and c.412C > T exon 4 mutations in the PKD1 gene were detected. Bioinformatics tools predicted that the novel variants have a pathogenic effects on splicing machinery, pre-mRNA secondary structure and stability and protein stability. Our results highlighted molecular features of Tunisian patients with ADPKD and revealed novel variations that can be utilized in clinical diagnosis and in the evaluation of living kidney donor. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of Autosomal Polycystic Kidney Disease in Tunisia.

AB Crcunbe abyssinica is an important oilseed crop that accumulates high levels of erucic acid, which is being recognized as a potential oil platform for several industrial purposes. It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, assigned within the tribe Brassiceae. Both family and tribe have been the subject of several phylogenetic studies, but the relationship between some lineages and genera remains unclear. Here, we report the complete sequencing and characterization of the C. abyssinica plastome. Plastome structure, gene order, and gene content of C. abyssinica are similar to other species of the family Brassicaceae. The only exception is the rps16 gene, which is absent in many genera within the family Brassicaceae, but seems to be functional in the tribe Brassiceae, including C. abyssinica. However, the analysis of gene divergence shows that the rps16 is the most divergent gene in C. abyssinica and within the tribe Brassiceae. In addition, species of the tribe Brassiceae also show similar SSR loci distribution, with some regions containing a high number of SSRs, which are located mainly at the single copy regions. Six hotspots of nucleotide divergence among Brassiceae species were located in the single copy regions by sliding window analysis. Brassicaceae phylogenomic analysis, based on the complete plastomes of 72 taxa, resulted in a well-supported and well-resolved tree. The genus Crambe is positioned within the Brassiceae Glade together with the genera Brassica, Raphanus, Sinapis, Cakile, Orychophragrnus and Sinalliaria. Moreover, we report several losses and gains of RNA editing sites that occurred in plastomes of Brassiceae species during evolution.

AB Natural antisense transcripts (NATs) are widely present in mammalian genomes and act as pivotal regulator molecules to control gene expression. However, studies on the NATs of pigs are relatively rare. Here, we identified a novel antisense transcript, designated PLA2G16-AS, transcribed from the phospholipase A2 group XVI locus (PLA2G16) in the porcine genome, which is a well-known regulatory molecule of fat deposition. PLA2G16-AS and PLA2G16 were dominantly expressed in porcine adipose tissue, and were differentially expressed between Tibetan pigs and Rongchang pigs. In addition, PLA2G16-AS has a weak sequence conservation among different vertebrates. PLA2G16-AS was also shown to form an RNA-RNA duplex with PLA2G16, and to regulate PLA2G16 expression at the mRNA level. Moreover, the overexpression of PLA2G16-AS increased the stability of PLA2G16 mRNA in porcine cells. We envision that our findings of a NAT for a regulatory gene associated with lipolysis might further our understanding of the molecular regulation of fat deposition.

AB The present study demonstrates the unique presence of three different gs genes (cmgs01, cmgs02, and cmgs03) in air-breathing ureogenic magur catfish (Clarias magur), which is otherwise reported to be encoded by a single gene in higher vertebrates. Of these three genes, two (cmgs01 and cmgs03) were identified as 'liver' form, predominantly expressed in liver cells, and the third one as 'brain' form (cmgs02), expressed chiefly in brain cells. Molecular characterization studies have revealed conservation of homologous active site residues in all the three gs genes. In silico analysis, accompanied by GS enzyme assay and Western blot analysis of different GS isoforms in different subcellular fractions indicated the mitochondrial localization of cmGS01 and cmGS03 in liver and kidney cells and cytosolic localization of cmGS02 in brain cells. Further, exposure of magur catfish to high external ammonia (HEA; 25 mM NH4Cl) led to a significant induction of multiple gs genes as evidenced by higher expression of different gs mRNAs at variable levels in different tissues. The cmgs01 and cmgs03 mRNA levels elevated significantly in liver, kidney, muscle, and gills, whereas the cmgs02 mRNA level increased considerably in the brain after 14 days of exposure to HEA. These increases in mRNA levels were associated with a significant rise in cmGS01 and cmGS03 proteins in liver, kidney, muscle, and gills, and the cmGS02 protein in the brain after 14 days of exposure to HEA. Therefore, it can be concluded that the unique differential expression of three gs genes and their induction under high ammonia level probably helps in detoxification of ammonia to glutamine and further to urea via the omithine-urea cycle in ureogenic as well as non-ureogenic tissues of these magur catfish.

AB Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNA) were discovered in tumors. The regulation of IncRNA in human laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma (LSCC) remains incomplete. Uncovering the potential of IncRNA to stratify the prognosis of LSCC and streamline the vast amount of clinical information will affect medical interventions. The surgical resected LSCC tissues, adjacent non-cancerous tissues (ANCT) and lymph node metastatic tissue (LNM) were collected from 76 patients for lncRNA AC008440.10 expression assay. The stages of LSCC and LNM were classified accordingly. We integrated the epigenetic information with enhanced CT imaging and pathological evaluations to predict the patients' survival by comprehensive statistical algorithms using equal weighting. Significant downregulation of IncRNA AC008440.10 was detected in LSCC tumor and metastatic lymph node in advanced stage of patient samples compared with those in early stage. The pattern of differentially expressed AC008440.10 displayed a clear trend that significantly related to tumor progression. The downregulation of IncRNA AC008440.10 correlates with increasing risk of metastasis, poor prognosis and patient survival. The potential for lncRNA AC008440.10 to be developed as a novel biomarker for stratification of the prognosis was especially promising when clinic parameters were hybridized with equal weight, and using a panel of complementary parameters yielded a more powerful predictability of LSCC prognosis than any single parameter individually.

AB Steroid (glucocorticoid)-induced osteonecrosis of the femoral head (SONFH) is a metabolic disease that occurs due to the use of glucocorticoid drugs, leading to impaired blood supply to the femoral head and death of bone cells and bone marrow composition, which in turn lead to structural change, collapse of the femoral head, and articular dysfunction. SONFH is a challenging disorder to treat in adults due to frequent collapse of the femoral head and dysfunction of the hip joint. Eventually, patients require joint arthroplasty surgery, which severely impairs the patients' quality of life. However, the exactly pathogenesis of SONFH is still not clear. Recently, as the development of precision medicine and lucubrating on stem cell and molecular biology, the exact pathogenesis of SONFH is being investigated and more new treatments are being explored. This review article discusses five major theories about the pathogenesis of SONFH.

AB Background: Diabetic macroangiopathy, atherosclerosis secondary to diabetes mellitus, causes cerebro-cardiovascular diseases (CVD), which increase the risk of death in patients with DM and significantly reduce their quality of life. Therefore, mechanisms underlying the common shared pathologies between type 2 diabetes (T2D) and atherosclerosis are key to prevention and treatment of diabetic macroangiopathy. However, the common shared pathological links between T2D and atherosclerosis are not fully understood.
   Methods: We constructed a T2D and atherosclerosis associated protein interaction sub-network (TAN) to investigate common shared mechanisms between T2D and atherosclerosis. In addition, MCODE plugin of Cytoscape was applied to TAN to identify most significant functional modules. The network modules were further mapped to KEGG pathway enrichment analysis. Finally, we established a miRNA-gene regulatory network by searching disease associated miRNAs and integrated them into miRNA-gene interaction network for each module.
   Results: TAN contains 1230 nodes which represent the union of T2D and atherosclerosis related genes and 3683 edges which represent the interactions of gene pairs. MCODE plugin was applied and five most significant modular clusters were identified. KEGG analysis of functional modules showed these genes were involved in several pathways including type 2 diabetes mellitus, ErbB and neurotrophin signaling pathway. miRNAgene interaction network was established and these miRNA-gene interactions mediated common shared pathologies between T2D and atherosclerosis.
   Conclusions: Analysis of TAN demonstrated that modular organization of the interaction network elucidates shared pathologies of T2D and atherosclerosis. Furthermore, the disease associated miRNA-gene interaction network enriched our insight into role of miRNAs in mediating common shared pathologies between T2D and atherosclerosis. Thus, miRNAs constitute attractive targets for the development of novel therapies for treating both T2D and atherosclerosis.

AB New functions of tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated protein 1 (TRAP1) have been investigated recently. This study explored if TRAP1 gene polymorphisms in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) are associated with disease susceptibility and the efficacy of glucocorticoids (GCs). A case control study was performed to explore the association between TRAP1 gene polymorphisms and susceptibility to SLE, then the SLE patients included in the case control study were followed to investigate the relationship between TRAP1 gene polymorphisms and efficacy of GCs. We also compared the improvement in health related quality of life (HRQOL) of patients among different genotypes of TRAP1 gene. The Benjamini-Hochberg (BH) method was used to correct for multiple comparison. In case control study, the significant association between rs8055172 and the susceptibility to SLE was discovered in the dominant model (p = 3.54 x 10(-7)), which is further supported by the different distributions of haplotype TT and TC of rs2072379 and rs8055172 (p = 4.26 x 10(-4) and p = 6.93 x 10(-9)). In the dominant model, rs3751842 and rs1639150 may be associated with fever of SLE patients (p = 0.035 and p = 0.028), while rs2072379 and rs12597773 related to oral ulcers (p = 0.021) and hematologic disorder (p = 0.035) respectively. In the follow-up study, rs6500552 showed a significant relationship with the efficacy of GCs in SLE patients in the dominant model (p = 0.004). Besides, rs3794701 was associated with the improvement in role-emotional (RE) of SLE patients in dominant model (p = 0.029). The results supported that TRAP1 gene polymorphisms may be associated with susceptibility to SLE and efficacy of GCs in SLE patients.

AB Sinapic acid (SA) is a derivative of hydroxycinnamic acid and found in various vegetables and fruit species. Aim was to evaluate the anticancer effects of SA in PC-3 and LNCaP human prostate cancer cells. The effect of SA on cell viability was determined using XTT assay. Expressions of 8 genes for apoptosis and 6 genes for metastasis were evaluated by qPCR. Caspase-3 activity was determined using caspase-3 colorimetric assay kit. Effect of SA on cell invasion was evaluated with cell invasion assay. The IC50 dose of SA in PC-3 and LNCaP cells was found to be 1000 mu M for 72 h. SA treatment increased the expression of BAX, CASP3, CASP8, CYCS, FAS, TIMP-1 and CDH1 however significantly decreased the expression of MMP-9 in PC-3 cells. In LNCaP cells, the expressions of BAX, CASP3, CASP7 and CYCS were significantly elevated; however, a decrease was seen in the expressions of CDH2, MMP-2 and MMP-9 in the SA treatment. Moreover, SA significantly increased caspase-3 activity and suppressed the cell invasion. In conclusion, it is thought that SA has anticancer effect on prostate cancer cells. However, more detailed studies should be conduct to illuminate molecular mechanism of apoptotic and anti metastatic activity of SA.

AB Accumulating evidences have shown that apoptosis plays an important role in mediating the therapeutic effects and toxicity of arsenic. Fas and Bax genes are critical regulatory genes for apoptosis. In this study, we investigated the association between levels of Fas and Bax expression and the three arsenic species (inorganic arsenic (iAs), monomethylarsonic acid (MMA) and dimethylarsinic acid (DMA)) in vivo and vitro. Three arsenic species in urine were measured and levels of Fas and Bax expression were examined by the quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) for all subjects. We found that Fas and Bax mRNA expression in the exposed group were significantly higher than that in the control group. The levels of gene expression were positively correlated with the concentrations of urinary iAs, MMA and DMA in all subjects. Sodium arsenite induced Fas and Bax mRNA expression, then MMA and DMA did not induce mRNA expression in MDA-MB-231 and XWLC-05 cells. The findings of the present study indicated that iAs, MMA, and DMA had different effects on expression of Bax and Fas gene.

AB Cowpea is an important horticultural crop in tropical and subtropical areas of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, as well as parts of southern Europe and Central and South America. Chilling injury is a common physiological hazard of cowpea in cold chain logistics which reduce the cowpea pods nutritional quality and product value. However, the molecular mechanism involved in chilling injury remains unclear in cowpea pods. RNA-Seq and sRNA-Seq technologies were employed to decipher the miRNAs and mRNAs expression profiles and their regulatory networks in cowpea pods involved in chilling stress. Differentially expressed miRNAs and mRNA profiles were obtained based on cluster analysis, miRNAs and target genes were found to show coherent relationships in the regulatory networks of chilling injury. Furthermore, we found that numerous miRNAs and nat-siRNAs' targets were predicted to be key enzymes involved in the redox reactions such as POD, CAT, AO and LOX, energy metabolism such as ATPase, FAD and NAD related enzymes and different transcription factors such as WRKY, bHLH, MYB, ERF and NAC which play important roles in chilling injury.

AB High-mobility group B (HMGB) proteins have highly conserved, unique DNA-binding domains, HMG boxes, that can bind non-B-type DNA structures, such as bent, kinked and unwound structures, with high affinity. HMGB proteins also promote DNA bending, looping and unwinding. In this study, we determined the role of the Aedes aegypti single HMG-box domain protein A alpha HMGB; characterized its structure, spatiotemporal expression levels, subcellular localization, and nucleic acid binding activities; and compared these properties with those of its double-HMG-box counterpart protein, A alpha HMGB1. Via qRT-PCR, we showed that A alpha HMGB is expressed at much higher levels than A alpha HMGB1 throughout mosquito development. In situ hybridization results suggested a role for A alpha HMGB and A alpha HMGB1 during embryogenesis. Immunolocalization in the midgut revealed that A alpha HMGB is exclusively nuclear. Circular dichroism and fluorescence spectroscopy analyses showed that A alpha HMGB exhibits common features of alpha-helical structures and is more stably folded than A alpha HMGB1, likely due to the presence of one or two HMG boxes. Using several DNA substrates or single-stranded RNAs as probes, we observed significant differences between A alpha HMGB and A alpha HMGB1 in terms of their binding patterns, activity and/or specificity. Importantly, we showed that the phosphorylation of A alpha HMGB plays a critical role in its DNA-binding activity. Our study provides additional insight into the roles of single- versus double-HMG-box-containing proteins in nucleic acid interactions for better understanding of mosquito development, physiology and homeostasis.

AB Ankylosing spondylitis (AS) is a highly heritable kind of arthritis that affects the vertebral column. AS risk has been associated strongly with Human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-B*27. In fact, some HLA-B*27 subtypes have been associated with the increased disease risk, although some specific subtypes have not shown such associations. It is supposed that HLA-B*27 plays a major role in the etiopathogenesis of the disease. However, the difference in pathogenic outcomes of HLA-B*27 certain subtypes needs to be clarified. The purpose of this review article is to overview on the detailed implications of the HLA-B*27 subtypes in the etiopathogenesis of AS. Moreover, the role of ERAP1 in AS and its epistasis with HLA-B*27 have been reviewed.

AB MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play important roles in tumorigenesis and tumor progression. In this study, we investigated the role of miR-320a-3p in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Expressions of miR-320a-3p were firstly determined in 80 NSCLC patients' cancer tissues and adjacent normal lung tissues by qRT-PCR. Then MTT assay, cell migration and invasion assays were performed in vitro. Potential binding sites on target gene of miR320a-3p were predicted and luciferase reporter assay was used to identify the potential binding sites. Tumorigenesis assay were performed in nude mice by injecting A549 cells which stably express miR-320a-3p. Results indicated that high expression of miR-320a-3p suppresses cell proliferation, migration and invasion through the inactivation of PI3K/Akt signaling pathway in NSCLC cells. Smaller tumor size and lighter weight were also found in nude mice which had miR-320a-3p higher expressed. Furthermore, data from luciferase reporter assay proved the direct binding of miR-320a-3p on the 3'UTR region of ELF3 mRNA, this could further decrease ELF3 expression transcriptionally. We provided evidence that miR-320a-3p might work as a tumor suppressor in NSCLC both in vivo and in vitro.

AB Chitin deacetylases (CDAs) are enzymes that catalyze the conversion of chitin into chitosan, thereby influence the mechanical and permeability properties of structures such as the cuticle and peritrophic matrices. The full length cDNAs of chitin deacetylase2 (CDA2) genes from Hyphantria cunea were fully cloned by PCR amplification. Two cDNA sequences of HcCDA2 were searched from transcriptome of H. cunea and named as HcCDA2c and HcCDA2b. The deduced protein sequences showed that HaCDA2a and HaCDA2b are synthesized as preproteins of 524 and 518 amino acid residues with an 18-amino acid signal peptide, respectively. HcCDA2a and HcCDA2b contained a chitin-binding domain (ChBD), a low-density lipoprotein receptor class A domain (LDLa) and a polysaccharide deacetylase-like catalytic domain (CDA). Gene expression analyses results showed that HcCDA2a and HcCDA2b were both expressed at the head, integument, foregut, midgut, hindgut, Malpighian tubules and fat body, as well as the 1st to 5th days of fifth instar larvae. Western blot analyses revealed that HcCDA2 protein was highly abundant in the head and integument, and the developmental expression result in the fifth instars showed that HcCDA2 was highly present at the first two days. Besides, RT-PCR results showed that HcCDA2a and HcCDA2b were both expressed in integument and head, whether in molting stage or feeding stage. No visiable phenotypic changes were observed after injection of dsHcCDA2b, while lethal phenotypes ol cuticle shedding failure and high mortality were resulted from injection of dsHcCDA2a. The silence of HcCDA2c leads to the ecdysis failure and death of H. cunea. These results suggest that HcCDA2 plays an important role during insect development, and provide new candidate targets and basis for developing environment-friendly pesticides.

AB Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the fifth most common cancer around the world, along with high mortality and metastasis rate. Our present study aimed to explore the role of LncRNA HOTAIR in the progression of HCC. Our data showed that HOTAIR was overexpressed in HCC tissues and cell lines (Huh7, Hep3B, HepG2, MHCC97H). Overexpressed HOTAIR promoted invasion and migration of HCC cells (Huh7) by enhancing epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Besides that, miR-23b-3p was predicted to be a target of HOTAIR and decreased expression of miR-23b-3p was observed in HCC tissues and cell lines. The up-regulation of HOTAIR strongly decreased the expression of miR-23b-3p. The further luciferase report confirmed the targeting reaction between HOTAIR and miR-23b-3p, suggesting that the expression of miR-23b-3p was negatively regulated by HOTAIR. Moreover, the zinc-finger E-box-binding homeobox 1 (ZEB1) protein was predicted to be a target of miR-23b-3p. The expression of ZEB1 was negatively regulated by miR-23b-3p while positively regulated by HOTAIR. Besides that, transfection with miR-23b-3p mimic counteracted the promoting effects of HOTAIR on invasion, migration and EMT of HCC cells. Our in vitro experiments suggested that HOTAIR promoted invasion and migration of HCC cells through enhancing EMT via sponging miR-23b-3p from ZEB1. Finally, the in vivo experiments indicated that HOTAIR could promote metastasis of HCC by enhancing EMT in vivo. Taken together, our study demonstrated that the HOTAIR-miR-23b-3p-ZEB1 axis may provide a new perspective for treatment of HCC.

AB PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway is involved in tumor initiation and progression, including gastric cancer (GC). However, the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in this pathway and underlying molecular mechanism remain largely unexplored. A case-control study of 1275 GC patients and 1436 controls was performed to explore the associations of potentially functional SNPs in PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway genes with the risk of GC. In the logistic regression analyses, one SNP rs7536272 out of the four candidate SNPs showed a significant association with GC risk (additive model: OR = 1.16, 95% CI = 1.03-1.30; co-dominant model: AG vs. AA, OR = 1.30, 95% CI = 1.11-1.53; dominant model: AG/GG vs. AA, OR = 1.28, 95% CI = 1.10-1.49).The luciferase assay indicated that rs7536272 G allele significantly enhanced the transcriptional activity, compared with A allele. Further expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) analysis showed that GC patients with rs7536272 AG/GG genotypes had remarkably higher PIK3R3 levels than those with AA genotype, suggesting that rs7536272 polymorphism influenced the expression of PIK3R3. Additionally, we observed that GC patients with high expression of PIK3R3 had significant poorer outcome than those with low expression (HR = 1.29, 95% CI = 1.09-1.53). Our result demonstrated that SNP rs7536272, a functional risk variant located in the promoter region of PIK3R3, showed association with increased transcriptional activity and upregulation of PIK3R3 expression, thus involved in GC development.

AB Mitochondrial calcium uptake (MICU) plays a vital role in the regulation of mitochondrial calcium homeostasis, and, consequently, influences calcium signaling transduction. Although genes involved in mitochondrial calcium uptake have been well studied in animals, less is known about their ubiquity and function in plants. In this study, we identified 96 MICU genes in land plants. On the basis of phylogenetic analysis of MICU proteins, they were classified into three clades: MICU from eudicots (Glade I), from monocots (Clade II), and from a basal angiosperm, a bryophyte, and a lycophyte (Clade III). Pairwise identity analysis across all MICU proteins showed that they are highly conserved among land plants at the protein level. Conserved motif analysis showed that most MICU proteins contained three EF-hands, and an additional EF-hand motif first identified in the MICU of Arabidopsis thaliana but not mammals was found in all 96 putative MICU proteins. This suggests that a cellular pathway of calcium uptake and signaling that requires three EF-hand motifs is evolutionarily conserved in plants. In addition, we discovered that MICU-defective mutants of Arabidopsis thaliana exhibited longer roots than wild-type under high calcium stress. Concurrently, the mRNA transcription levels of MICU were decreased under high calcium conditions. These results suggest that loss-of-function mutations of MICU may have potential roles in helping plants resist high calcium stress. This study provides clues to the possible role of plant MICU in mitochondrial calcium uptake, as well as useful information to support further studies on MICU function in plants.

AB Background: Influenza vaccine is not included in the Hong Kong Government's universal Childhood Immunisation Programme but eligible children can receive subsidised vaccine through the private sector using the Vaccination Subsidy Scheme (VSS). This study examined whether a simple intervention package can increase influenza vaccine uptake in Hong Kong children.
   Methods: Two study samples were enrolled: families of children who had participated in a previous knowledge, attitudes and practices study; and mother-infant pairs recruited from postnatal wards. Control groups received publicly available leaflets about VSS. Intervention groups additionally received: (1) a concise information sheet about influenza and its vaccine; (2) semi-completed forms to utilise the subsidy; (3) contacts of VSS clinics that did not charge above the subsidy; and (4) text message reminders for vaccination. Enrolled mothers were contacted when children were approximately 1 and 2 years old to determine influenza vaccination status of the families and their plan to vaccinate their children. Mothers' attitudes towards influenza vaccine were assessed at enrolment and at the end of the study.
   Results: A total of 833 eligible mother-infant pairs were enrolled from the two samples. The intervention package improved influenza vaccine uptake by 22% at one year and 25% at two years of age. Maternal influenza vaccine uptake in intervention group was higher during this two-year period in those who had never been previously vaccinated. Mothers' self-efficacy regarding the use of influenza vaccine in her child i.e. belief and confidence in her own ability to make a good decision, was also improved with the intervention.
   Conclusions: A four-component intervention package could improve influenza vaccine uptake in Hong Kong children and their mothers during the first two years of life and depending on vaccine effectiveness could potentially reduce influenza-associated hospital admissions in children below 2 years old by 13-24%.

AB Introduction: Improving evidence informed decision-making in immunisation is a global health priority and many low and middle-income countries have established National Immunisation Technical Advisory Groups (NITAGs) as independent technical advisory bodies for this purpose. NITAG development and strengthening has received financial and technical support over the past decade, but relatively little evaluation. This study examined NITAGs in six low and middle-income countries (i.e. Armenia, Ghana, Indonesia, Nigeria, Senegal, Uganda), to examine functionality, quality of recommendation development, and integration with national decision-making bodies and processes.
   Methods: A mixed-method case-series design, used semi-structured interviews, NITAG meeting observations, and document review. Data were analysed thematically.
   Results: Five NITAGs had been legally established with terms of reference and appeared well functioning, with Ghana's in development. All NITAGs had standard operating procedures and nomination procedures to ensure a range of expertise, generally comprising 10-15 core, 1-5 secretariat, and several ex-officio members. Aside from economics, NITAGs reported a wide range of member expertise. Newer NITAGs had particular concerns about funding. Four used formal conflict of interest procedures, although some commented that implications were not always understood. NITAGs valued local data, and limited evidence suggested NITAG presence might reinforce data production through surveillance and local research studies. All observed meetings demonstrated due process and evidence-based decision-making processes were generally followed, with a critical role played by working-group data syntheses and assessments. NITAGs were seen as well integrated with ministry of health (MoH) decision-making and MoH interviewees were positive about NITAG contributions, indicating NITAGs had an important role. Collaboration with other bodies was more limited, but mitigated by NITAG members' cross-membership in other bodies.
   Conclusions: NITAGs have an important and valued role within national immunisation decision-making. However, their position remains insecure, with the need for sustainable technical and financial support. (C) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Background: Sexual mixing between heterogeneous population subgroups is an integral component of mathematical models of sexually transmitted infections (STIs). This study compares the fit of different mixing representations to survey data and the impact of different mixing assumptions on the predicted benefits of hypothetical human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine strategies.
   Methods: We compared novel empirical (data-driven) age mixing structures with the more commonly-used assortative-proportionate (A-P) mixing structure. The A-P mixing structure assumes that a proportion of sexual contacts - known as the assortativity constant, typically estimated from survey data or calibrated - occur exclusively within one's own age group and the remainder mixes proportionately among all age groups. The empirical age mixing structure was estimated from the National Survey on Sexual Attitudes and Lifestyles 3 (Natsal-3) using regression methods, and the assortativity constant was estimated from Natsal-3 as well. Using a simplified HPV transmission model under each mixing assumption, we calibrated the model to British HPV16 prevalence data, then estimated the reduction in steady-state prevalence and the number of infections averted due to expanding HPV vaccination from 12- through 26-year-old females alone to 12-year-old males or 27- to 39-year-old females.
   Results: Empirical mixing provided a better fit to the Natsal-3 data than the best-fitting A-P structure. Using the model with empirical mixing as a reference, the model using the A-P structure often under- or over-estimated the benefits of vaccination, in one case overestimating by 2-fold the number of infections prevented due to extended female catch-up in a high vaccine uptake setting.
   Conclusions: An empirical mixing structure more accurately represents sexual mixing survey data, and using the less accurate, yet commonly-used A-P structure has a notable effect on estimates of HPV vaccination benefits. This underscores the need for mixing structures that are less dependent on unverified assumptions and are directly informed by sexual behavior data. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Introduction: Heterogeneous coverage threatens to compromise the effectiveness of immunization programs in Zambia. Demand-creation initiatives are needed to address this; however, there is incomplete understanding of why vaccine coverage is suboptimal. We investigated overarching perceptions on vaccine acceptability, hesitancy, and accessibility at three informal settlements in Lusaka, Zambia.
   Methods: Nested within a cholera vaccination uptake study, we sought to understand overarching perceptions on vaccines' hesitancy in three informal settlements in Lusaka, Zambia. We conducted 48 focus group discussions with a convenience sample of laypersons, lay healthcare workers, neighbourhood health committee members and vaccinators.
   Results: Both laypersons and community-based health actors reported high vaccine acceptance though several sources of hesitancy were reported. Traditional remedies, alcohol use and religious beliefs emerged as drivers of vaccine hesitancy, likely reinforced by a background of distrust towards western medicine. Also mentioned were previous adverse events, fear of injections and low perceived need for immunization. Limited understanding of how vaccines work and overlapping local terms for vaccine and other medical concepts created confusion and inaccurate views and expectations. Some reported refusing injections to avoid pain and perceived risk of infection. Discussants emphasised the importance of education and preferred mobile immunization campaigns, with weekend to reach those with poor access and delivered by a combination of professional and volunteer workers.
   Conclusions: Vaccine hesitancy in Zambia is underpinned by many factors including personal experiences with vaccinations, alternative belief models, limited knowledge, deep misunderstanding about how vaccines work, and barriers to access. To overcome these, community-driven models that incorporate factual communication by professionals and operate outside of traditional hours, may help. Better research to understand community preferences for vaccine uptake could inform interventions to improve immunization coverage in Zambia. (C) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB This article presented the World Health Organization's (WHO) recommendations on the use of Rabies vaccines excerpted from the Rabies vaccines: WHO position paper - April 2018 published in the Weekly Epidemiological Record [1] This position paper replaces the 2010 WHO position paper on rabies vaccines [2]. It presents new evidence in the field of rabies and the use of rabies vaccines, focussing on programmatic feasibility, simplification of vaccination schedules and improved cost-effectiveness. The recommendations concern the 2 main immunization strategies, namely vaccination for post-exposure prophylaxis and vaccination for pre-exposure prophylaxis. In the context of post-exposure prophylaxis, recommendations are also provided on the use of rabies immunoglobulins.
   Footnotes to this paper provide a number of core references including references to grading tables that assess the quality of the scientific evidence, and to the evidence-to-recommendation tables. In accordance with its mandate to provide guidance to Member States on health policy matters, WHO issues a series of regularly updated position papers on vaccines and combinations of vaccines against diseases that have an international public health impact. These papers are concerned primarily with the use of vaccines in large-scale immunization programmes; they summarize essential background information on diseases and vaccines, and conclude with WHO's current position on the use of vaccines in the global context. Recommendations on the use of cholera vaccines were discussed by the Strategic Advisory Group of Experts (SAGE) in October 2017; evidence presented at these meetings can be accessed at: http://www.who.int/immunization/sage/meetings/2017/october/presentations_background_docs/en/.

AB Objectives: We assessed the vaccine effectiveness (VE) of inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV) in children 6 months to 15 years of age during the 2016/17 season. In addition, we estimated the impact of repeated vaccination in children on VE.
   Methods: Our study for VEs in preventing influenza and admission due to influenza were conducted according to a test-negative case-control design (TNCC) based on influenza rapid diagnostic test results. We also analyzed the VE by vaccine status in the current and previous seasons for the impact of repeated vaccination.
   Results: During the 2016/17 season, the quadrivalent IIV was used in Japan. The adjusted VE in preventing influenza illness was 38% (95% CI, 29-46) against influenza A and 39% (95% CI, 18-54) against influenza B. Infants showed no significant VE. The VE in preventing hospitalization was not demonstrated. For the analysis of repeated vaccination, the vaccine was effective only when immunization occurred in the current season. The children who were immunized in two consecutive seasons were more likely to develop influenza compared to those immunized in the current season only (odds ratio, 1.58 [95% CI, 1.05-2.38], adjusted odds ratio, 1.53 [95% CI, 0.99-2.35]). However, the odds ratio of repeated vaccination was not significant when the analysis excluded those who developed influenza in the previous season.
   Conclusions: VE in children in the 2016/17 season was similar to values previously reported. Repeated vaccination interfered with the VE against any influenza infection in the 2016/17 season. The results of our study suggest that decreased VE by repeat vaccination phenomenon was associated with immunity by influenza infection in the previous season. However, the influenza vaccine should be recommended every season for children. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Background: A newly developed bovine-human reassortant pentavalent vaccine (BRV-PV, ROTASIIL (R)) was tested for its potential effect on the immunogenicity of concomitantly administered EPI vaccines in infants in a randomized controlled study in India.
   Methods: In this Phase III, multicenter, open label, randomized, controlled study, three doses of BRV-PV or two doses of Rotarix (R) and one dose of placebo were given to healthy infants at 6, 10, and 14 weeks of age. Subjects also received three doses of DTwP-HepB-Hib (diphtheria, tetanus, whole-cell pertussis, hepatitis B, and haemophilus influenzae type b conjugate - pentavalent vaccine) and oral polio vaccine concomitantly at 6, 10, and 14 weeks of age and a single dose of inactivated polio vaccine at 14 weeks of age. Blood samples were collected four weeks after the final vaccination to assess immune responses to all the vaccines administered. For diphtheria, tetanus, hepatitis B, Hib, polio type 1, and polio type 3 antibodies, non-interference was to be supported if the lower limit of the two-sided 90% confidence interval (CI) for the seroprotection rate difference for the BRV-PV group minus the Rotarix (R) group was >10.0%. For pertussis antibodies, non-interference was to be supported if the lower limit of the two-sided 90% CI for the ratio of geometric mean concentrations (GMCs) was >0.5.
   Results: A total of 1500 infants were randomized to either BRV-PV (1125 infants) or Rotarix (R) (375 infants), of which 1341 completed the study as per the protocol. More than 97% of subjects achieved seroprotective antibody titres against diphtheria, tetanus, hepatitis B, Hib, polio type 1, and polio type 3 in both groups. The difference in seroprotection rates between the BRV-PV group and the Rotarix (R) group for all these antibodies was less than 1%. The ratio of GMCs of anti-pertussis IgG concentrations for the BRVPV group versus Rotarix (R) was 1.04 [90% CI: 0.90; 1.19].
   Conclusion: BRV-PV does not interfere with the immunogenicity of concomitantly administered routine infants vaccines. (C) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

DE Vaccines; Vaccine confidence; Cross-sectional study; Slovenia
ID UNITED-STATES; REFUSAL; PARENTS
AB Objectives: We conducted the first nationwide survey in Slovenia to measure and characterise vaccine confidence among mothers of young children. This survey measured confidence in routine vaccines for children <2 years of age and in the information sources about these vaccinations to provide baseline data for public health actions to maintain and improve vaccination coverage.
   Methods: We randomly selected women giving birth in 2014-15 from the national perinatal information system (N = 39,497). Participants were asked to rate statements measuring vaccine confidence, including confidence in their child's paediatrician, the Slovenian healthcare system, and different paediatric vaccination information sources. We estimated vaccine confidence with 95% confidence intervals (CI), for seven socio-demographic characteristics for mothers with young children. Spearman's rank correlation coefficient was used to assess correlations between vaccine confidence and the confidence in the health system or child's paediatrician.
   Results: We sent out 3854 questionnaires, the response rate was 44.4%. While 46.8% (95% CI: 44.4-49.2%) mothers were confident in vaccines, 34.2% (95% CI: 32.0-36.6%) were undecided. We found a correlation (Spearman's rho = 0.457) between vaccine confidence and confidence in the child's paediatrician. Mothers that were confident in paediatrician were more likely to be confident in vaccines (odds ratio: 7.7; 95% CI: 5.3-11.3). Overall, the most frequently trusted information source were physicians (84.6%). In contrast, among mothers not at all confident in vaccines, 51.9% reported friends as the trusted information source.
   Conclusion: More than half of mothers had low vaccine confidence or were undecided regarding their confidence. While vaccination coverage in Slovenia is high, these levels warrant public health intervention, particularly with the undecided mothers. Communication strategies should focus first on undecided parents and involve physicians, who for many are the most trusted vaccine information source. Different approaches will likely be required for those who are not at all confident in vaccines. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background: Equine group A rotaviruses (RVAs) cause diarrhea in suckling foals. The dominant RVAs circulating among horses worldwide, including Japan, are G3P[12] and/or G14P[12] genotypes. Inactivated vaccines containing a G3P[12] RVA are commercially available in some countries for prevention of diarrhea caused by equine RVA5. However, there is no reported evidence whether vaccines containing a G3P[12] RVA are effective against G14P[12] RVAs or whether using a G14P[12] RVA results in a more effective vaccine. This study used a suckling mouse model to evaluate the effectiveness of inactivated vaccines containing G3P[12] (G3 vaccine) or G14P[12] (G14 vaccine) RVAs against G3P[12] and G14P[12] RVAs.
   Methods: Female mice were inoculated twice with G3 or G14 vaccines, and were then mated. After parturition, suckling mice were challenged with one of either two G3P[12] RVAs, two G14P[12] RVAs, or one G13P[18] RVA. After virus inoculation, suckling mice were observed for diarrhea, and the incidence rates of diarrhea in the vaccinated groups were compared with those in the non-vaccinated groups.
   Results: Following G3P[12] RVA challenge, suckling mice in the G3 and G14 vaccinated groups had significantly lower rates of diarrhea incidence than did those in the non-vaccinated group, and the rates in the G3 vaccinated group tended to be lower than in the G14 vaccinated group. Following G14P[12] RVA challenge, suckling mice in the G14 vaccinated group had significantly lower rates of diarrhea incidence than did those in the non-vaccinated and G3 vaccinated groups. The G3 and G14 vaccines did not reduce the rate when challenged with the G13P[18] RVA.
   Conclusion: The mouse model showed that the G3 and G14 vaccines were both effective against G3P[12] RVAs, and that the G14 vaccine was effective against G14P[12] RVAs. These results suggest that at least a G14 RVA strain should be included in as a vaccine strain. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background: A forty-year debate on the potential negative effects of repeated seasonal influenza vaccination has been inconclusive, with multiple observational studies of various design providing heterogeneous results too inadequate to inform vaccination policy.
   Methods: A large population-based cohort study including over one-million observations in individuals over age 65 from six consecutive seasons (2011/12-2016/17) in Stockholm County, Sweden. Current season vaccine effectiveness (VE) against severe, mostly hospital-attended, influenza was assessed using Cox multivariate regression analyses adjusting for demographic variables, comorbidities and previous seasonal influenza vaccination status.
   Results: In none of the six seasons was VE significantly different in persons vaccinated in the current season only, compared to those who had been vaccinated in both the current and the previous season. Neither were there any differences in VE during the seasons 2014/15-2016/17 when comparing persons vaccinated during the current season only vs. those vaccinated during one-three or four-five previous influenza seasons. In contrast, persons only vaccinated during one or more previous years had no protection during the current season.
   Conclusions: Persons above 65 years are the largest group at risk for severe or complicated influenza and policy should support their yearly seasonal influenza vaccination, which is to-date the best preventive measure available for all risk groups. No negative effects of repeated seasonal vaccination were seen in this large population-based cohort of older persons with severe influenza, which strengthens the recommendation that persons belonging to this age group should be vaccinated yearly.

AB Background: Norovirus is thought to be responsible for a fifth of all acute gastroenteritis cases globally each year. The population level transmission dynamics of this very common virus are still poorly understood, in part because illness is under-reported. With vaccines undergoing clinical trials, there is a growing need for appropriate, empirically grounded models, to predict the likely impact of vaccination.
   Methods: We developed a dynamic age-specific mathematical model of norovirus transmission and vaccination, informed by available data, particularly age-stratified time series case notification data. We introduce the use of a self-reporting Markov model to account for variation by age and over time in the statutory reporting of norovirus in Germany. We estimated the model using a sequential Monte Carlo particle filter. We then extended and applied our estimated model to investigate the potential impact of a range of immunisation strategies. We performed sensitivity analyses on the mode of vaccine action and other vaccine-related parameters.
   Results: We find that routine immunisation could reduce the incidence of norovirus by up to 70.5% even when those vaccines do not provide complete protection from disease. Furthermore, we find that the relative efficiency of alternative strategies targeting different age groups are dependant on the outcome we consider and are sensitive to assumptions on the mode of vaccine action. Strategies that target infants and toddler are more efficient in preventing infection but targeting older adults is preferable for preventing severe outcomes.
   Conclusions: Our model provides a robust estimate of a dynamic transmission model for norovirus at the population level. Vaccination may be an effective strategy in preventing disease but further work is required to ascertain norovirus vaccine efficacy, its mode of action and to estimate the cost-effectiveness of immunisation against norovirus.

AB Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is a major cause of disability in congenitally infected infants and in the immunosuppressed. There is currently no licensed prophylactic HCMV vaccine. The HCMV envelope glycoprotein B (gB) is considered a major vaccine target antigen based on its critical role in mediating viral-host cell fusion and thus viral entry. The natural conformation of HCMV gB within the viral envelope is a trimer, but there has been no reported success in producing a recombinant trimeric gB suitable for vaccine use. Phase II clinical trials of a monomeric recombinant gB protein demonstrated 50% efficacy in preventing HCMV infection in seronegative women of reproductive age, and in reducing viremia in solid organ transplantation recipients. We now report the production of a uniformly trimeric recombinant HCMV gB protein in Chinese ovary cells, as demonstrated by Western blot analysis under modified non-reducing conditions and size exclusion chromatography with multi-angle scattering. Immunization of mice with trimeric HCMV gB induced up to 11-fold higher serum titers of total gB-specific lgG relative to monomeric HCMV gB using Alum + CpG as adjuvants. Further, trimeric HCMV gB elicited 50-fold higher complement-independent and 20-fold higher complement-dependent HCMV neutralizing titers compared to monomeric HCMV gB using the fibroblast cell line, MRC-5, and up to 6-fold higher complement-independent and -dependent HCMV neutralizing titers using the epithelial cell line, ARPE-19. The markedly enhanced HCMV neutralizing activity in response to trimeric HCMV gB was also observed using an additional four distinct clinical HCMV isolates. These data support a role for trimeric HCMV gB as an important component for clinical testing of a prophylactic HCMV vaccine. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB The aim of this study was to develop and test an optimal vaccination strategy against bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) based on the E2 glycoprotein of the BJ1305 strain. To achieve higher E2-specific antibody titers and to broaden the cellular immune response, a plasmid encoding the E2 protein (pcDNA3.1-E2) was constructed and a purified recombinant E2 protein was generated. The E2 protein was emulsified in the adjuvant ISA 61 VG prior to administration. We immunized mice three times with pcDNA3.1-E2 or the recombinant E2 protein or primed twice with pcDNA3.1-E2 and boosted once with the E2 protein. To evaluate the protection against BVDV conferred by the vaccines, the mice were challenged with BVDV strain Oregon C24V after the third immunization. Although all immunized mice developed humoral and cellular immune responses, the E2-specific antibody titers in the DNA prime-protein boost group were significantly higher than those elicited by either the DNA or the protein vaccine. In addition, vaccination with the E2 DNA vaccine induced higher percentages of CD4(+)IFN-gamma(+) T cells and CD8(+)IFN-gamma(+) T cells among total CD3(+) T cells than the other regimens. The predominant antibody subclass in the vaccinated mice was IgG1. Serum tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNE-alpha) levels in the DNA prime-protein boost group were significantly higher after the third immunization than in the other groups. Moreover, the mice treated with the DNA prime-protein boost vaccination regimen acquired protection against BVDV challenge, as shown by a significant reduction of viremia, only minor pathological changes, and a lower viral antigen burden than in the control and solo vaccinated mice. These results demonstrate the potential advantage of a DNA prime-protein boost vaccination approach over a solo vaccination for the prevention of BVDV. The ability of this vaccine strategy to control and eradicate BVD in herds warrants further investigation. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Because vaccine co-administration can affect elicited immune responses, it is important to evaluate new vaccines in the context of pre-existing vaccination schedules. This is particularly necessary for new pediatric vaccines, as the World Health Organization's infant immunization program already schedules several vaccines to be administered during the first months of life. To facilitate the assessment of inter-vaccine interference, we developed a pediatric vaccine multiplex assay (PVMA) to simultaneously measure antibodies against vaccines commonly administered to infants, including hepatitis B, Haemophilus influenzae type B, diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, rubella, and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). Comparison of antibody concentrations determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) and the PVMA demonstrated that the PVMA is highly sensitive, specific, reproducible, and accurate. Moreover, the PVMA requires half the time to assess a cohort compared to ELISAs, and only costs marginally more. Demonstrating the utility of the assay, we employed the PVMA to assess vaccine interference in the setting of a candidate vaccine, using the infant HIV vaccines from the completed Pediatric AIDS Clinical Trials Group (PACTG) protocols 230 and 326 as examples. There was no substantial difference in antibody concentrations between vaccine and placebo recipients, which suggests that HIV vaccination did not disrupt antibody responses elicited by routine pediatric vaccines. Thus, the PVMA is a reliable, high-throughput technique that requires minimal sample volume to measure multiple antibody concentrations concurrently, and is an efficient alternative to ELISAs for the measurement of vaccine-elicited antibody responses in large cohorts.

AB Background: Pertussis cases have increased worldwide and knowledge on immune response and cytokine profile after Tdap vaccine in immunodeficient adolescents is scarce.
   Objective: To evaluate the immune response after Tdap in HIV-infected (HIV) and in healthy adolescents (CONTROL).
   Methodology: Thirty HIV adolescents with CD4 cell counts >200 and 30 CONTROLS were immunized with Tdap, after a prior whole-cell DTP vaccine primary scheme. Blood samples were collected immediately before and after vaccine. Lymphocyte immunophenotyping was performed by flow cytometry; tetanus, diphtheria and pertussis toxin antibodies were assessed by ELISA; whole blood was stimulated with tetanus toxoid and Bordetella pertussis and supernatants were assessed for cytokines by xMAP.
   Results: Mean age of HIV and CONTROL groups were 17.9 e 17.1 years, respectively. Pain at injection site was more intense in CONTROL group. HIV group had similar increase in tetanus antibodies at 28 days (geometric mean concentration, GMC, 15.6; 95% CI, 7.52-32.4) than CONTROL group (GMC, 23.1; 95% CI, 15.0-35.5), but lower diphtheria antibodies at 28 days (GMC, 2.3; 95% CI, 0.88-6.19) than CONTROL group (GMC, 16.4; 95% CI, 10.3-26.2); for pertussis, the percentage of individuals who seroconverted was lower in HIV than CONTROL group (HIV, 62.1% versus CONTROL, 100%; p = .002). Both groups built a cellular immune response to tetanus, with a Th2 (IL-4, IL-5 and IL-13) and Th1 (IFN-gamma) response, with lower cytokine levels in HIV than in CONTROL group. Especially for pertussis, cellular and humoral responses were less intense in HIV adolescents, with a lower Th1 and Th17 profile and higher IL-10 levels. HIV-infected adolescents on viral suppression showed an enhanced immune response to all the three vaccine antigens, although still at lower levels if compared to CONTROL group.
   Conclusions: Both groups tolerated well and built an immune response after Tdap. However, HIV-infected adolescents would probably benefit from more frequent booster doses. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Tuberculosis (TB) is the biggest cause of human mortality from an infectious disease. The only vaccine currently available, bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG), demonstrates some protection against disseminated disease in childhood but very variable efficacy against pulmonary disease in adults. A greater understanding of protective host immune responses is required in order to aid the development of improved vaccines. Tissue-resident memory T cells (T-RM) are a recently-identified subset of T cells which may represent an important component of protective immunity to TB. Here, we demonstrate that intradermal BCG vaccination induces a population of antigen-specific CD4(+) T cells within the lung parenchyma which persist for >12 months post-vaccination. Comprehensive flow cytometric analysis reveals this population is phenotypically and functionally heterogeneous, and shares characteristics with lung vascular and splenic CD4(+) T cells. This underlines the importance of utilising the intravascular staining technique for definitive identification of tissue-resident T cells, and also suggests that these anatomically distinct cellular subsets are not necessarily permanently resident within a particular tissue compartment but can migrate between compartments. This lung parenchymal population merits further investigation as a critical component of a protective immune response against Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tb). (C) 2018 The Authors.

AB The first evidence in humans that a safe and effective preventive vaccine for HIV is possible came from the phase III HIV clinical trial RV144 in Thailand. This trial was based on a prime/boost combination of a recombinant canarypox vaccine and two glycoprotein 120 proteins (ALVAC-HIV and AIDSVAX B/E). A pivotal phase IIb/III trial has recently commenced in the Republic of South Africa, for which the infectious titer assay was applied as the quantitative release test for the ALVAC-HIV vaccine. The infectious titer assay measures the ability of the vaccine vector to infect target permissive cells, but does not indicate if the vaccine transgenes are expressed. We have developed a high-throughput biological activity assay that provides results in agreement with the infectious titer assay. This assay uses flow cytometry to quantify expression of ALVAC-HIV encoded proteins gp120 and p24 in human cells. This transgene expression is detected by two cross-Glade-reactive, biologically functional human anti-gp120 monoclonal antibodies isolated from clinical trial participants and a commercial mouse anti-p24 monoclonal antibody. The relative biological activity of the vaccine test sample is calculated by comparison of the test sample doseresponse curve against that of a reference standard. We show that the novel biological activity assay is specific, accurate, precise, stability-indicating, and robust. The assay is being used for characterization of ALVAC-HIV (vCP2438) product, the efficacy of which is being evaluated in the pivotal phase IIb/III clinical trial HVTN702. The biological activity assay has the potential to indicate vaccine consistency and quality as a complement to the infectious titer assay. (C) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI Strengthening routine immunization through measles-rubella elimination
SO VACCINE

DE Measles elimination; Rubella elimination; Vaccine-preventable disease;
   Vaccination coverage; Routine immunization; Supplementary immunization
   activities
AB The 2016 mid-term review of the Global Measles-Rubella Strategic Plan 2012-20 for achieving measles-rubella elimination concluded that the full potential of strategies and activities to strengthen routine immunization (RI) service delivery had not been met. In December 2017, we contacted WHO and partner agency immunization staff in all six WHO Regions who identified 23 countries working on measles or rubella elimination that have implemented examples of recommended activities to improve RI, adapted to their needs. Among those examples, opportunities to strengthen RI through implementing supplementary immunization activities (SIAs) were reported most frequently, including advocacy for immunization and educational activities targeted at the public and skills training targeted at health professionals. The expansion of cold chain capacity to accommodate supplies required for SIAs facilitated widening RI service delivery to reach more communities, introduce new vaccines, and reduce the risk of vaccine stock-outs. Substantial numbers of under-vaccinated children, according to the national immunization schedule, have been identified during SIAs, but it is not possible to confirm whether these children actually received missing RI doses. Micro-planning exercises for SIAs have generated data that permitted the revision of catchment populations for fixed site and outreach RI services. Some countries reported using the opportunity afforded by measles/rubella elimination to strengthen overall vaccine-preventable disease surveillance and outbreak preparedness and to introduce mandatory school-entry vaccination requirements covering other vaccines in addition to measles and rubella. Unfortunately, we were unable to obtain information regarding the cost, impact or sustainability of these activities. The evaluation of the many other strategies that have been deployed in recent years to strengthen RI systems and raise vaccination coverage was beyond the scope of this survey. We conclude by providing recommendations to encourage more countries to adapt and implement a comprehensive set of RI-strengthening activities in association with the MR elimination goal.

TI Varicella in the prison setting: A report of three outbreaks in Rhode
   Island and a review of the literature
SO VACCINE
LA English
DT Review
DE Varicella; Outbreak; Prison; Response; Vaccine
ID INFECTION; HEALTH
AB Background: The prison setting carries unique risks for varicella outbreaks and the disease in adults, particularly those who are immunocompromised, can be life-threatening. In 2016-17, there were three outbreaks of varicella at three different correctional facilities in Rhode Island. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommend post-exposure vaccination within three to five days for affected populations however the Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP) notes the logistical challenges of vaccinating exposed incarcerated individuals.
   Material and methods: A descriptive analysis was performed for each outbreak along with an overview of the response. Varicella serologies were obtained from the exposed population at each facility and the results compiled for comparative analysis. A literature review was then performed to identify and analyze other reported varicella outbreaks in incarcerated populations.
   Results: In each outbreak, the sentinel event was an inmate with herpes zoster. In prison A, there were 432 inmates exposed to the virus leading to 5 cases of varicella, while the outbreak in Prison B exposed 46 inmates and led to 3 cases. In Prison C, there was one case of primary varicella and 97 inmates were exposed.
   Discussion: It is remarkable that there were 3 unrelated outbreaks in a short time and, although corroborating data would be necessary to establish a trend, it may signal an increased risk of varicella transmission within this population. Correctional facilities should remain vigilant and have plans for managing the disease including isolation protocols, serology testing and post-exposure vaccination when indicated. While the BOP does not provide clear recommendations on the use of post-exposure prophylaxis during an outbreak response in this population, the experience in Rhode Island and the review of the literate demonstrate steps that can be taken to facilitate a response including post-exposure vaccination in line with CDC recommendations.

AB Introduction: Pharmacists in the United States (U.S.) are authorized to administer vaccines. This study described: how and to what extent immunization services are offered, promoted, and documented in community pharmacies; reasons for referral to other locations for vaccination; and perceived barriers to immunization services.
   Methods: A mixed-mode (mail/electronic) survey of a stratified random sample of 1999 nationally-representative community pharmacies in the U.S. was conducted in April July 2017. Survey instrument development was informed by validated scales and 10 in-depth interviews with community pharmacists; content and face validity were ensured via pre- (n = 5) and pilot-tests (n = 26) among community pharmacists. Potential non-response bias was investigated and descriptive statistics were used to analyze survey responses.
   Results: Of the 1999 community pharmacies, 119 pharmacies were deemed ineligible. Of those eligible pharmacies, complete responses were provided by 292 respondents, each representing a unique pharmacy (15.5% response rate). Respondents were evenly split male/female (52.5/47.5%) and about half were pharmacy managers (51.3%). The majority (79.5%) reported offering at least one type of vaccine in 2016, with the most commonly administered vaccine types (average doses in 2016) being: Influenza (484), Pneumococcal 13-valent conjugate (55), Herpes Zoster (41), and Pneumococcal polysaccharide (39). Two-thirds (66.7%) of immunizing pharmacies provided adolescent vaccinations. Most frequently reported referral reasons were patients' insurance not covering vaccine administration at the pharmacy and patients' age not within approved protocol, policy or state law. The majority of respondents did not perceive organizational and environmental factors as barriers; however, they reported patient-related factors, especially cost and insurance coverage, as important barriers.
   Conclusions: The majority of U.S. community pharmacies reported offering at least one type of vaccine. The scope of pharmacy engagement in immunization services varied in terms of how and to what extent they were offered and documented. Addressing patient-related barriers is needed to further enhance pharmacy-based immunization services. (C) 2018 GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals SA. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Background: 2-dose varicella vaccination has been available in Ningbo city, China since 2014 in the private sector. This study aimed to evaluate the breakthrough varicella infection rate, and to examine overall and incremental effectiveness of 2-dose varicella vaccination among Chinese children.
   Methods: A retrospective investigation was done among native children born from 2008 to 2013 in active surveillance area in Ningbo, China. Between 2009 and 2016, demographic information and data on varicella vaccination were collected by Ningbo's Immunization Information System, and information of varicella infections were obtained from China Information System for Disease Control and Prevention. The logistic regression was conducted to estimate varicella vaccine effectiveness (VE).
   Result: A total of 107,324 local children were enrolled in the cohort analysis and 95.11% of these children with no varicella disease history received at least 1-dose varicella vaccine from 2009 to 2016. The total breakthrough varicella infection rate (BVR) was 0.37% for all the vaccinated children and 0.04% for 2-dose vaccination. The annual BVR ranged from 0.01% to 0.49% for 1-dose of varicella vaccine and from 0.01% to 0.02% for 2-dose. The infection rates both in the unvaccinated children and the 1-dose children were decreasing after 2-dose vaccination implemented in 2014 (Unvaccinated: P < 0.001 for trend; 1-dose: P= 0.003 for trend). The VE against all varicella was 50.3% (95% CI: 39.8%-59.0%) for 1-dose (P < 0.001) and 98.7% (95% CI: 98.1%-99.1%) for 2-dose (P < 0.001), and the incremental VE was 97.4% (95% CI: 96.2%-98.2%) compared with 1-dose (P< 0.001).
   Conclusion: The 2-dose regimen provided excellent protection to prevent all varicella, and the universal 2-dose regimen of varicella vaccine should be recommended to prevent the varicella disease among children in China. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB RNAi (RNA interference) is a technology for silencing expression of target genes via sequence-specific double-stranded RNA (dsRNA). Recently, dietary introduction of bacterially expressed dsRNA has shown great potential in the field of pest management. Identification of potential candidate genes for RNAi is the first step in this application. The oriental armyworm, Mythimna separata Walker (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) is a polyphagous, migratory pest, and outbreaks have led to severe crop damage in China. In the present study, two tubulin genes were chosen as target genes because of their crucial role in insect development. Both Ms alpha-tubulin and Ms beta-tubulin genes are expressed across all life stages and are highly expressed in the head and epidermis. Feeding of bacterially expressed dsRNA of Ms alpha-tubulin and Ms beta-tubulin to third-instar larvae knocked down target mRNAs. A lethal phenotype was observed with knockdown of Ms alpha-tubulin and Ms beta-tubulin concurrent with reduction in body weight. Bacterially expressed dsRNA can be used to control M. separata, and tubulin genes could be effective candidate genes for an RNAi-based control strategy of this pest.

AB Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a key developmental program in which epithelial cells lose polarity and become mesenchymal cells, and that is often activated during cancer invasion and metastasis. Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) patients have a relatively aggressive biological behavior with a high risk of distant recurrence and metastasis. Here, we stimulated TNBC cells to undergo EMT, and detected the protein expression profiles of the protein secretion. High-throughput data showed that EMT could promote TNBC cells to secret PAI-1. We found that TNBC-secreted PAI-1 could increase cell growth, migration and invasion, and the expression of EMT markers in the TNBC cell lines and xenograft PAI-1 - / - mice model. Using a tissues microarray of 165 TNBC patients and published breast cancer database, we found PAI-1 expression was significantly elevated in the breast cancer tissues, comparing with the normal adjacent tissues and was associated with prognosis of patients with TNBC. Taken together, our results suggests an important role of PAI-1 in the EMT process of TNBC cells and illustrates the great potential of developing PAI-1-targeting therapy for clinical TNBC patients.

AB Apoptosis plays a vital role in the developmental process of the mammalian reproduction system, such as during folliculogenesis or spermatogenesis. Kinesin superfamily (Kif) proteins are responsible for intercellular transportation, and their malfunction can induce cell apoptosis. Oocyte-G1 is a new Kif member. Our previous study suggested that abnormal expression of Oocyte-G1 induced abnormal development of ovarian follicle and testes, but the underlying mechanism was not fully discovered. Therefore, in this study, the cellular role and mechanism of Oocyte-G1 were investigated. Transferase-mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate-biotin nick end labeling (TUNEL) result showed that overexpression of Oocyte-G1 increased apoptosis in cultured cells. Oocyte-G1 transgenic mice also showed an increased apoptotic rate in male germ cells compared with controls. Immunoprecipitation and co-localization experiments revealed an interaction between Oocyte-G1 and Caspase3. Expression levels of Caspase-3 were upregulated in cells overexpressing Oocyte-G1 and downregulated in Oocyte-G1 knockdown cells. These results suggest that Oocyte-G1 may promote male germ cell apoptosis through activating Caspase-3.

AB Alternative splicing and alternative promoter usage have been shown to have an integral role in creating flexibility in the regulation of gene expression. Previous studies collectively showed that expression of the retinol binding protein 7 (Rbp7) gene was adipose tissue-specific across species. Nevertheless, alternative splicing and alternative promoter usage of the Rbp7 gene in adipose tissue and other tissues have not been investigated. The objectives of this study were to investigate protein isoforms of RBP7 produced from alternative splicing, alternative promoter usage and pre-mRNA trans-splicing, and to examine expression patterns of RBP7 isoforms during adipogenesis, cold exposure, and retinol or retinoic acid treatment. Our RT PCR analysis revealed that mouse Rbp7 isoforms were present, but only one protein isoform was detected which was specific to adipose tissue. In addition, a fusion transcript of the Nmnat1 gene and the Rbp7 gene was produced by pre-mRNA transsplicing in several tissues; however, its protein expression was not detectable. During adipogenesis, RBP7 expression was prominent in both neonatal and after-weaning stages and its expression was significantly higher in fat cells than in preadipocytes. Exposure to cold led to an increased expression of RBP7 in brown adipose tissue (BAT). Furthermore, Rbp7 mRNA expression in 3T3-L1 cells was significantly up- and down-regulated by retinol and retinoic acid, respectively. Our data showed that the mouse Rbp7 gene produces a predominant isoform in adipose tissue during adipocyte development, cold exposure, and nutritional treatments, which can be a potential target for future investigation on reduced adiposity.

AB Alternative splicing is a key process required for the regulation of gene expression in normal development and physiology. It is regulated by splice factors whose activities are in turn regulated by splice factor kinases and phosphatases. The CDC-like protein kinases are a widespread family of splice factor kinases involved in normal physiology and in several diseases including cancer. In humans they include the CLK1, CLK2, CLK3 and CLK4 genes. The expression of CLK1 is regulated through alternative splicing producing both full-length catalytically active and truncated catalytically inactive isoforms, CLKT1 (arising from exon 4 skipping) and CLKT2 (arising from intron 4 retention). We examined CLKI alternative splicing in a range of cancer cell lines, and report widespread and highly variable rates of exon 4 skipping and intron 4 retention. We also examined the effect of severe environmental stress including heat shock, osmotic shock, and exposure to the alkaloid drug harmine on CLK1 alternative splicing in DU145 prostate cancer cells. All treatments rapidly reduced exon 4 skipping and intron 4 retention, shifting the balance towards full-length CLK1 expression. We also found that the inhibition of CLK1 with the benzothiazole TG003 reduced exon 4 skipping and intron 4 retention suggesting an autoregulatory mechanism. CLK1 inhibition with TG003 also resulted in modified alternative splicing of five cancer-associated genes.

AB Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) constitutes an important histological subtype of breast cancer with a highly metastatic phenotype. The aim of the current study was to investigate the possible synergism between dendrosomal nanocurcumin (DNC) and exogenously delivered p53 in producing anticancer effects on a TNBC cell line. MTT assay was exploited to determine the viability of MDA-MB-231 cells against DNC and measure the impact of p53 overexpresssion on DNC-related cytotoxicity. Annexin-V/PI staining followed by flow cytometry and wound healing assay were used to evaluate the effects of DNC and exogenous p53, alone and in combination, on apoptosis induction and migratory capacity of MDA-MB-231 cells, respectively. Also, quantitative real-time PCR was applied to analyze the transcript levels of EMT- and metastasis-associated genes. Cell viability measurements demonstrated that DNC suppresses the proliferation of MDA-MB-231 cells in a time- and dose-dependent mode and exogenous p53 elevates the sensitivity of cells to DNC-mediated cytotoxic effects. Apoptosis and wound healing assays indicated that combination treatment with DNC and exogenous p53 leads to significantly increased apoptosis and decreased migration of breast cancer cells, compared with single treatment. The results of gene expression analysis highlighted the high potency of combination strategy to significantly reduce the expression of ZEB1 and BMI1 transcript levels. Altogether, our findings reveal that DNC and exogenous p53 act in a synergistic manner to elicit anticancer effects on MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. Therefore, our combination approach might be considered as a promising strategy for the development of new therapeutic modalities against breast cancer.

Extensive past studies have characterized many appressorium-related Fruit rot caused mainly by Colletotrichum gloeosporioides is a major cause of pre- and/or post-harvest diseases, which seriously constrains production, marketing, and export of fruits. To infect the host, this fungus evolves a specialized infection structure called the appressorium. Extensive past studies have characterized many appressorium-related genes in C. gloeosporioides, separately. However, a comprehensive understanding of the genes contributing to appressorium formation is far from complete. Here, global changes in gene expression were analyzed between appressoria and hyphae using RNA-Seq. We identified 4071 genes that are up-regulated in appressorium and discovered 468 unigenes that are expressed only in appressoria, compared with the fungal hyphae. Differentially expressed genes between appressoria and hyphae were assigned to 107 KEGG pathways, including metabolic pathways, secondary metabolite biosynthesis, molecular transport and signal transduction. Fourteen putative ABC transporter genes are significantly up-regulated in appressoria, and in contrast, twenty six down-regulated. One hundred and one transcription factor genes show more than a 2-fold up-regulation in appressoria compared to hyphae. The up-regulation of 39 secreted protein candidates is observed, suggesting they may play important roles in initial infection processes. Our data demonstrate that appressorium development of C. gloeosporioides is accompanied by significant changes in gene expression, which provides novel insights to elucidate how this fungus regulates its development, pathogenicity and immune evasion.

AB Using publicly available genomic data, combined with RT-PCR validation, we explore structural genomic variation for two major ion channels across insect classes. We have manually curated ryanodine receptor (RyR) and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (IP3R) ORFs and their corresponding genomic structures from 26 different insects covering major insect orders. We found that, despite high protein identity for both RyRs ( > 75%) and IP(3)Rs (similar to 67%), the overall complexity of the gene structure varies greatly between different insect orders with the simplest genes (fewest introns) found in Diptera and the most complex in Lepidoptera. Analysis of intron conservation patterns indicated that the majority of conserved introns are found close to the 5' end of the channels and in RyR around the highly conserved mutually exclusive splice site. Of the two channels the IP(3)Rs appear to have a less well conserved organisation with a greater overall number of unique introns seen between insect orders. We experimentally validated two of the manually curated ORFs for IP(3)Rs and confirmed an atypical (3799aa) IP3R receptor in Myzus persicae, which is approximately 1000 amino acids larger than previously reported for IP(3)Rs.

AB Lipid accumulation is an important cellular process of oleaginous microorganisms. To dissect metabolic behavior of oleaginous Zygomycetes, the lipid over-producing strain, Mucor circinelloides WJ11, was subjected for omics-scale analysis. The genome annotation was improved and used for construction of genome-scale metabolic network of WJ11 strain. Then, the quality of the metabolic network was enhanced by incorporating gene and protein expression data. In addition to the known oleaginous genes, our results showed a number of newly identified unique genes of WJ11 strain, which involved in central carbon metabolism, lipid, amino acid and nitrogen metabolisms. The systematic compilations indicated the additional metabolic routes with the involvement in supplying precursors (acetyl-CoA, NADPH and fatty acyl substrate) for fatty acid and lipid biosynthesis. Interestingly, amino acid metabolism played a substantial role in responsive mechanism of the fungal cells to nutrient imbalance circumstance through lipogenesis as the finding of reporter metabolites (L-methionine, L-glutamate, L-aspartate, L-asparagine and L-glutamine) at lipid-accumulating stage. The cooperative function of certain lipid-degrading enzymes at the particular growth stage was elucidated by integrating the metabolic networks with gene expression data. The unique feature of carotenoid biosynthetic route in WJ11 strain was also identified by protein domain analysis. Taken together, there were cross-functional metabolisms in regulating lipid biosynthesis and retaining high level of cellular lipids in the representative of lipid over-producing strains.

AB We aim to explore the correlation of TNFSF15 genetic polymorphisms with susceptibility to systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). This study enrolled SLE patients and healthy individuals to detect three single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of TNFSF15 (rs3810936, rs6478108 and rs4979462) through using polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) to analyze the possible association of these three SNPs with the risk of SLE and the mRNA level of TNFSF15 was quantified by real-time PCR. The rs3810936 T allele carrier greatly decreased risk of SLE (OR = 0.620, 95% CI = 0.454-0.849, P = 0.003), while the risk of SLE for rs4979462 T allele carrier was significantly increased (OR = 1.66, 95% CI = 1.243-2.218, P < 0.001). The mRNA level of TNFSF15 was obviously higher in SLE patients, and specifically, the patients who carried the CC genotype of TNFSF15 rs3810936 had a higher TNFSF15 mRNA, but the rs4979462 CC genotype carriers appeared to be associated with the decreased TNFSF15 mRNA (all P < 0.05). Besides, the genotypes of rs3810936 and rs4979462 of TNFSF15 were significantly associated with butterfly rash, arthritis, serositis, renal nephritis, hematological disorder, immunological disorder and positive antinuclear antibody (ANA) of SLE patients (all P < 0.05). CCT and Cl f haplotypes were risk factors of SLE, but CCC and TTT were protective factors of SLE (all P < 0.05). Logistic regression analysis showed that rs3810936 and rs4979462 of TNFSF15, histories of chilblain and wet living environment were independently associated with the risk of SLE (all P < 0.05).The current results suggested that TNFSF15 (rs3810936 and rs4979462) SNPs may confer susceptibility to SLE risk, which were significantly associated with the clinical phenotypes of SLE.

AB In the dairy industry, genetic variants have contributed to the improvement of milk production traits. Fatty acid elongase 6 (ELOVL6), which elongates saturated fatty acids (SFAs) and monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs), plays a distinct role in the balance of long-chain fatty acids composition in animals. ELOVL6 catalyzes the elongation of palmitic acids (C16:0) which is the most common saturated fatty acid found in animals and also an essential precursor to synthesize other long-chain fatty acids. However, the genetic variant research of bovine ELOVL6 on milk quality traits is still unknown. Therefore, our study aimed to detect the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs) of bovine ELOVL6 and explored the relationship between SNPs and milk quality traits including milk yield, fat content, protein content and somatic cell score. In this study, three SNPs, including SNP1 (g16379651A > G), SNP2 (g16458976A > G) and SNP3 (g16511290A > G), have been identified in intron 3 and 3'UTR regions of ELOVL6 in Chinese Holstein (CH) cows. Besides, the results of genetic diversity analysis, linkage disequilibrium and haplotype analysis indicated that these SNPs presented moderate polymorphisms which reflected relatively high genetic diversity. No strong linkage among these SNPs were detected in sampled population of cows. Moreover, the results of correlation analyses demonstrated that these SNPs of bovine ELOVL6 were significantly related to milk yield (P < 0.05). The SNP1 was also correlated with somatic cell score, whereas the SNP3 was associated with fat content. The 21 combined genotypes (diplotypes) were highly significantly correlated (P < 0.01) with milk yield. These results revealed that the genetic variants of bovine ELOVL6 influenced the milk production of CH cows. Hence, the three SNPs could be regarded as molecular markers in marker-assisted selection (MAS) of the dairy cow breeding.

AB Many molecular epidemiologic studies have shown that interleukin-6 (IL-6) polymorphisms are significantly associated with susceptibility for various cancers. However, the conclusions of these studies are inconsistent. The purpose of the present study was to explore the association between three common IL-6 loci (rs1800795, rs1800796, and rs1800797) and the risk for various cancers. We systematically searched the PubMed, Web of Science, Wanfang and China national knowledge infrastructure (CNKI) databases for relevant publications and obtained 108 eligible studies, involving 49,408 cancer patients and 61,790 cancer-free controls. Odds ratio (OR), 95% confidence interval (CI), and false positive reporting probability (FPRP) were used to evaluate cancer risk. All statistical analyses were performed using the R software meta package. We observed a non-significant association between rs1800795 and overall cancer risk, while rs1800797 was found to have a false positive association with overall risk of cancer. Subgroup analyses of rs1800797 also suggested non-significant association and rs1800795 played a protective role in liver cancer. Rs1800796 was found to be associated with overall cancer risk, particularly in Asian patients and those with prostate cancer. These findings provide evidence that IL-6 polymorphisms may affect cancer risk.

AB Background: Genetic polymorphisms in lncRNA HULC may affect the susceptibility and clinical outcome of cancer. We aimed to investigate the association of HULC tagSNPs with the risk and prognosis of hepatocellular cancer, as well as the influence of the SNPs on lncRNA expression level.
   Methods: A total of 1338 samples were recruited in the risk study. Among them, 351 HCC patients were involved in the prognosis study. SNP genotyping was performed using RASP method and lncRNA expression was detected by Real-time PCR.
   Results: We found a promoter SNP, rs1041279, was associated with a 1.41-fold increased HCC risk (P = 0.032). In the stratified analysis, rs1041279 had greater ORs for the increased HCC risk in the male subgroup (P = 0.014, OR = 1.54). Furthermore, multi-logistic regression analysis revealed a two-way interaction effect of smoking-rs2038540 SNP on HCC risk (OR = 4.20). And MDR analysis consistently demonstrated a SNP-environmental interaction among smoking-drinking-rs2038540 SNP as the best model for predicting HCC risk (P = 0.0107). In our study, no significant association was found between HULC SNPs and the overall survival (P > 0.05), and no significant effect was observed of rs1041279 SNP on lncRNA-HULC expression (P > 0.05).
   Conclusion: lncRNA-HULC rs1041279 SNP and the interaction of rs2038540 SNP with environmental factors could enhance HCC risk. 1.

AB The human SR-related CTD associated factor 1 (SCAF1) gene is a new member of the human SR (Ser/Arg-rich) superfamily of pre-mRNA splicing factors, which has been discovered and cloned by members of our lab. SCAF1 interacts with the CTD domain of the RNA polymerase II polypeptide A and is firmly involved in pre-mRNA splicing. Although it was found to be expressed widely in multiple human tissues, its mRNA levels vary a lot. The significant relation of SCAF1 with cancer has been confirmed by many studies, since SCAF1 mRNA transcript was found to be overexpressed in breast and ovarian tumors, confirming its significant prognostic value as a cancer biomarker in both these human malignancies. In this study, we describe the discovery and cloning of fifteen novel transcripts of the human SCAF1 gene (SCAF1 v.2 - v.16), using nested PCR and NGS technology. In detail, extensive bioinformatic analysis revealed that these novel SCAF1 splice variants comprise a total of nine novel alternative splicing events between the annotated exons of the gene, thus producing seven novel SCAF1 transcripts with open-reading frames, which are predicted to encode novel SCAF1 isoforms and eight novel SCAF1 transcripts with premature termination codons that are likely long non-coding RNAs. Additionally, a novel 3' UTR was discovered and cloned using nested 3' RACE and was validated with Sanger sequencing. In order to validate the NGS findings as well as to investigate the expression profile of each novel transcript, RT-PCR experiments were carried out with the use of variant-specific primers. Since SCAF1 is implicated in many human malignancies, qualifying as a potential biomarker, the quantification of the presented novel transcripts in human samples may have clinical applications in different types of cancer.

AB Ovarian cancer is the most lethal malignancy of the women genital tract. Exploring novel factors involved in the development of ovarian cancer and characterizing the molecular mechanisms by which regulate the tumorigenesis of ovarian cancer are quite necessary. Here, we found that miR-19a was highly expressed in ovarian cancer tissues and cell lines. Overexpression of miR-19a promoted the viability of ovarian cancer cells, while down-regulation of miR-19a inhibited the growth of ovarian cancer cells. To further understand the underlying molecular mechanism of miR-19a in regulating ovarian cancer cell growth, the downstream targets of miR-19a were predicted. The bioinformatics analysis showed that the tumor suppressor PTEN was found as one of the targeting candidates of miR-19a. MiR-19a bound the 3'-UTR of PTEN and highly expressed miR-19a decreased both the mRNA and protein levels of PTEN in ovarian cancer cells. Overexpression of PTEN suppressed the promoting effect of miR-19a on regulating the growth of ovarian cancer cells. Notably, the expression of miR-19a and PTEN was inversely correlated in ovarian cancer tissues. These results demonstrated the potential oncogenic role of miR-19a in ovarian cancer, which suggested that miR-19a might be a promising target in the diagnosis and treatment of ovarian cancer.

AB The latest studies in Algeria show that the frequency of type 1 diabetes (T1D) without complications is lower than that with complications and represents a significant burden in terms of cost and treatment. For this reason, we are interested in uncomplicated type1 diabetes and risk factors that are related to polymorphisms of anti-oxidant enzymes in order to prevent its complications.
   A total of 260 blood samples of young Algerian adults were examined. The genotypic analysis of Catalase gene (CAT - 262C/T, rs1001179) and the superoxide dismutase gene (MnSOD 47C/T, rs4880) was performed by real-time PCR using TaqMan technology.
   The genotypic distribution of the CAT - 262C/T promoter gene's polymorphism showed a significant difference between control and T1D patients for the CC genotype (p = 0.009; OR = 0.30) and for the T allele (p = 0.002; OR = 2.82). In addition, the genotypic distribution of the MnSOD 47C/T gene showed an association with T1D for the CT genotype (p = 0.040; OR = 2.37).
   Our results revealed that polymorphisms of CAT and MnSOD may be associated with physiopathology causing the onset of T1D. Our data, suggest that the genotypic frequencies of these SNPs appear to be influenced by clinical variables and by the Arab-Berber ethnic origin of the Algerian population.

AB Pasteurella multocida is a gram-negative, non-motile bacterial pathogen, which is associated with chronic and acute infections as snuffles, pneumonia, atrophic rhinitis, fowl cholera and hemorrhagic septicemia. These diseases affect a wide range of domestic animals, leading to significant morbidity and mortality and causing significant economic losses worldwide. Due to the interest in deciphering the genetic diversity and process adaptive between P. multocida strains, this work aimed was to perform a pan-genome analysis to evidence horizontal gene transfer and positive selection among 23 P. multocida strains isolated from distinct diseases and hosts. The results revealed an open pan-genome containing 3585 genes and an accessory genome presenting 1200 genes. The phylogenomic analysis based on the presence/absence of genes and islands exhibit high levels of plasticity, which reflects a high intraspecific diversity and a possible adaptive mechanism responsible for the specific disease manifestation between the established groups (pneumonia, fowl cholera, hemorrhagic septicemia and snuffles). Additionally, we identified differences in accessory genes among groups, which are involved in sugar metabolism and transport systems, virulence-related genes and a high concentration of hypothetical proteins. However, there was no specific indispensable functional mechanism to decisively correlate the presence of genes and their adaptation to a specific host/disease. Also, positive selection was found only for two genes from sub-group hemorrhagic septicemia, serotype B.

TI Data standards for interoperability of care team information to support
   care coordination of complex pediatric patients
SO JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL INFORMATICS

ID HEALTH RECORDS
AB Objective: Seamless access to information about the individuals and organizations involved in the care of a specific patient ("care teams") is crucial to effective and efficient care coordination. This is especially true for vulnerable and complex patient populations such as pediatric patients with special needs. Despite wide adoption of electronic health records (EHR), current EHR systems do not adequately support the visualization and management of care teams within and across health care organizations. Electronic health information exchange has the potential to address this issue. In the present study, we assessed the adequacy of available health information exchange data standards to support the information needs related to care coordination of complex pediatric patients.
   Methods: We derived data elements from the information needs of clinicians and parents to support patient care teams; and mapped them to data elements in the Health Level Seven (HL7) Consolidated Clinical Document Architecture (C-CDA) standard and in the HL7 Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) standard. We also identified additional C-CDA data elements and FHIR resources that include patients' care team members.
   Results: Information about care team members involved in patient care is generally well-represented in the C-CDA and FHIR specifications. However, there are gaps related to patients' non-clinical events and care team actions. In addition, there is no single place to find information about care team members; rather, information about practitioners and organizations may be available in several different types of C-CDA data elements and FHIR resources.
   Conclusion: Through standards-based electronic health information exchange, it appears to be feasible to build patient care team representations irrespective of the location of patient care. In order to gather care team information across disparate systems, exchange of multiple C-CDA documents and/or execution of multiple FHIR queries will be necessary. This approach has the potential to enable comprehensive patient care team views that may help improve care coordination.

ID SEQUENCE SYMMETRY ANALYSIS; DISPROPORTIONALITY
AB Drug safety issues such as Adverse Drug Events (ADEs) can cause serious consequences for the public. The clinical trials that are undertaken to assess medicine efficacy and safety prior to marketing, generally, may provide sufficient samples for discovering common ADEs. However, more samples are needed to detect infrequent and rare events. Additionally, clinical trials may not include all subgroups of patients. For these reasons, post-marketing surveillance of medicines is necessary for identifying drug safety issues. Most regulatory agencies use the Spontaneous Reporting Systems to identify associations between medicines and suspected ADEs. Data mining with effective analytical frameworks and large-scale medical data is potentially an alternative method to discover and monitor ADEs. In the present paper, we aim to detect potential ADEs from prescription data by discovering ADE associated prescription sequences. In an ADE associated prescription sequence (D-p -> D-s) the prior medicine D-p leads to an ADE for which the succeeding medicine D-s is dispensed to treat. We propose a data driven method which integrates (1) a constrained sequential pattern mining to uncover prescription sequences as potential signals of ADEs, (2) domain constraints to eliminate interference signals and (3) an adapted Self Controlled Case Series model to evaluate the potential signals of ADEs. Despite ample prior works using Electronic Health Records (EHRs), our method utilises pure prescription data which does not contain additional information, e.g. symptoms or diagnoses as included in EHRs. To assess the performance of the proposed method, we apply it to a real-world dataset from the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme of Australia. The dataset contains over 50 million records covering approximately 2 million patients. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in identifying both known ADEs and unknown yet suspicious ADEs with limited detection of false positive signals. Comparing to a recognised gold standard, our method successfully detects 67.4% of the positive adverse events while only 8.78% false positives exist.

AB Most laboratory results are valid for only a certain time period (laboratory tests shelf-life), after which they are outdated and the test needs to be re-administered. Currently, laboratory test shelf-lives are not centrally available anywhere but the implicit knowledge of doctors. In this work we propose an automated method to learn laboratory test-specific shelf-life by identifying prevalent laboratory test order patterns in electronic health records. The resulting shelf-lives performed well in the evaluation of internal validity, clinical interpretability, and external validity.

AB Introduction: Many chronic disorders have genomic etiology, disease progression, clinical presentation, and response to treatment that vary on a patient-to-patient basis. Such variability creates a need to identify characteristics within patient populations that have clinically relevant predictive value in order to advance personalized medicine. Unsupervised machine learning methods are suitable to address this type of problem, in which no a priori class label information is available to guide this search. However, it is challenging for existing methods to identify cluster memberships that are not just a result of natural sampling variation. Moreover, most of the current methods require researchers to provide specific input parameters a priori.
   Method: This work presents an unsupervised machine learning method to cluster patients based on their genomic makeup without providing input parameters a priori. The method implements internal validity metrics to algorithmically identify the number of clusters, as well as statistical analyses to test for the significance of the results. Furthermore, the method takes advantage of the high degree of linkage disequilibrium between single nucleotide polymorphisms. Finally, a gene pathway analysis is performed to identify potential relationships between the clusters in the context of known biological knowledge.
   Datasets and results: The method is tested with a cluster validation and a genomic dataset previously used in the literature. Benchmark results indicate that the proposed method provides the greatest performance out of the methods tested. Furthermore, the method is implemented on a sample genome-wide study dataset of 191 multiple sclerosis patients. The results indicate that the method was able to identify genetically distinct patient clusters without the need to select parameters a priori. Additionally, variants identified as significantly different between clusters are shown to be enriched for protein-protein interactions, especially in immune processes and cell adhesion pathways, via Gene Ontology term analysis.
   Conclusion: Once links are drawn between clusters and clinically relevant outcomes, Immunochip data can be used to classify high-risk and newly diagnosed chronic disease patients into known clusters for predictive value. Further investigation can extend beyond pathway analysis to evaluate these clusters for clinical significance of genetically related characteristics such as age of onset, disease course, heritability, and response to treatment.

ID DIMENSIONALITY
AB The volume of biomedical data available to the machine learning community grows very rapidly. A rational question is how informative these data really are or how discriminant the features describing the data instances are. Several biomedical datasets suffer from lack of variance in the instance representation, or even worse, contain instances with identical features and different class labels. Indisputably, this directly affects the performance of machine learning algorithms, as well as the ability to interpret their results. In this article, we emphasize on the aforementioned problem and propose a target-informed feature induction method based on tree ensemble learning. The method brings more variance into the data representation, thereby potentially increasing predictive performance of a learner applied to the induced features. The contribution of this article is twofold. Firstly, a problem affecting the quality of biomedical data is highlighted, and secondly, a method to handle that problem is proposed. The efficiency of the presented approach is validated on multi-target prediction tasks. The obtained results indicate that the proposed approach is able to boost the discrimination between the data instances and increase the predictive performance.

ID REIDENTIFICATION; PRIVACY; PRIMER
AB Protecting personally identifiable information is important in clinical research. The authors, two faculty members involved in developing and implementing research infrastructure for a medical school, observed challenges novice researchers encountered in recognizing, collecting, and managing Protected Health Information (PHI) for clinical research. However, we had difficulty finding resources that provide practical strategies for novice clinical researchers for this topic. Common issues for beginners were: 1. Recognition of PHI, e.g. lack of recognition of 'indirect' PHI, i.e., that the combination of two or more non-PHI data types or other specific information could result in identifiable data requiring protection; 2. Collection of PHI, e.g., proposed collection of data not necessary for fulfillment of the project's objectives or potential inadvertent collection of PHI in free text response items; and 3. Management of PHI, e.g., proposed use of coding systems that directly included PHI, or proposed data collection techniques, electronic data storage, or software with inadequate protections. From these observations, the authors provide the following in this paper: 1. A brief review of the elements of PHI, particularly 'indirect' PHI; 2. Sample data management plans for common project types relevant to novice clinical researchers to ensure planning for data security; 3. Basic techniques for avoiding issues related to the collection of PHI, securing and limiting access to collected PHI, and management of released PHI; and 4. Methods for implementing these techniques in the Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap) system, a commonly used and readily available research data management software system.

AB Objectives: To (1) characterize how machine translation (MT) is being developed to overcome language barriers in health settings; and (2) based on evaluations presented in the literature, determine which MT approaches show evidence of promise and what steps need to be taken to encourage adoption of MT technologies in health settings.
   Materials & methods: We performed a systematic literature search covering 2006-2016 in major health, engineering, and computer science databases. After removing duplicates, two levels of screening identified 27 articles for full text review and analysis. Our review and qualitative analysis covered application setting, target users, underlying technology, whether MT was used in isolation or in combination with human editing, languages tested, evaluation methods, findings, and identified gaps.
   Results: Of 27 studies, a majority focused on MT systems for use in clinical settings (n = 18), and eight of these involved speech-based MT systems for facilitating patient-provider communications. Text-based MT systems (n = 19) aimed at generating a range of multilingual health materials. Almost a third of all studies (n = 8) pointed to MT's potential as a starting point before human input. Studies employed a variety of human and automatic MT evaluation methods. In comparison studies, statistical machine translation (SMT) systems were more accurate than rule-based systems when large corpora were available. For a variety of systems, performance was best for translations of simple, less technical sentences and from English to Western European languages. Only one system has been fully deployed.
   Conclusions: MT is currently being developed primarily through pilot studies to improve multilingual communication in health settings and to increase access to health resources for a variety of languages. However, continued concerns about accuracy limit the deployment of MT systems in these settings. The variety of piloted systems and the lack of shared evaluation criteria will likely continue to impede adoption in health settings, where excellent accuracy and a strong evidence base are critical. Greater translation accuracy and use of standard evaluation criteria would encourage deployment of MT into health settings. For now, the literature points to using MT in health communication as an initial step to be followed by human correction.

AB Objective: Application of machine learning techniques for automatic and reliable classification of clinical documents have shown promising results. However, machine learning models require abundant training data specific to each target hospital and may not be able to benefit from available labeled data from each of the hospitals due to data variations. Such training data limitations have presented one of the major obstacles for maximising potential application of machine learning approaches in the healthcare domain. We investigated transferability of artificial neural network models across hospitals from different domains representing various age demographic groups (i.e., children, adults, and mixed) in order to cope with such limitations.
   Materials and methods: We explored the transferability of artificial neural networks for clinical document classification. Our case study was to detect abnormalities from limb X-ray reports obtained from the emergency department (ED) of three hospitals within different domains. Different transfer learning scenarios were investigated in order to employ a source hospital's trained model for addressing a target hospital's abnormality detection problem.
   Results: A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model exhibited the best effectiveness compared to other networks when employing an embedding model trained on a large corpus of clinical documents. Furthermore, CNN models derived from a source hospital outperformed a conventional machine learning approach based on Support Vector Machines (SVM) when applied to a different (target) hospital. These models were further improved by leveraging available training data in target hospitals and outperformed the models that used only the target hospital data with F1-Score of 0.92-0.96 across three hospitals.
   Discussion: Our transfer learning model used only simple vector representations of documents without any task specific feature engineering. Transferring the CNN model significantly improved (approx.10% in F1-Score) the state-of-the-art approach for clinical document classification based on a trivial transferred model. In addition, the results showed that transfer learning techniques can further improve a CNN model that is trained only on either a source or target hospital's data.
   Conclusion: Transferring a pre-trained CNN model generated in one hospital to another facilitates application of machine learning approaches that alleviate both hospital-specific feature engineering and training data.

TI How does normalization impact RNA-seq disease diagnosis?

ID SINGULAR-VALUE DECOMPOSITION; EXPRESSION; SELECTION
AB With the surge of next generation high-throughput technologies, RNA-seq data is playing an increasingly important role in disease diagnosis, in which normalization is assumed as an essential procedure to produce comparable samples. Recent studies have seen different normalization methods proposed to remove various technical biases in RNA sequencing. However, there are no previous studies evaluating the impacts of normalization on RNA-seq disease diagnosis.
   In this study, we investigate this problem by analyzing structured big data: RNA-seq data acquired from the TCGA portal for its popularity in RNA-seq disease diagnosis. We propose a novel normalization effect test algorithm, diagnostic index (d-index), and data entropy to analyze and evaluate the impacts of normalization on RNA-seq disease diagnosis by using state-of-the-art machine learning models. Furthermore, we present an original visualization analysis to compare the performance of normalized data versus raw data.
   We have found that normalized data yields generally an equivalent or even lower level diagnosis than its raw data. Moreover, some normalization approaches (e.g. RPKM) even bring negative effects in disease diagnosis. On the other hand, raw data seems to have the potential to decipher pathological status better or at least comparable than when the data is normalized. Our visualization analysis also shows that some normalization methods even bring 'outliers', which unavoidably decreases sample detectability in diagnosis. More importantly, our data entropy analysis shows that normalized data usually demonstrates equivalent or lower entropy values than raw data. Those data with high entropy values tend to achieve better diagnosis than those with low entropy values. In addition, we found that high-dimensional imbalance (HDI) data is unaffected by any normalization procedures in diagnosis, and fails almost all machine learning models by only recognizing majority types in spite of raw or normalized data.
   Our results suggest that normalized data may not demonstrate statistically significant advantages in disease diagnosis than its raw form. It further implies that normalization may not be an indispensable procedure in RNA-seq disease diagnosis or at least some normalization processes may not be. Instead, raw data may perform better for capturing more original transcriptome patterns in different pathological conditions.

ID HEALTH BEHAVIOR; BIG-DATA; MODELS; MOBILE; TRIAL; TIME
AB Health interventions using real-time sensing technology are characterized by intensive longitudinal data, which has the potential to enable nuanced evaluations of individuals' responses to treatment. Existing analytic tools were not developed to capitalize on this opportunity as they typically focus on first-order findings such as changes in the level and/or slope of outcome variables over different intervention phases. This paper introduces an exploratory, Markov-based empirical transition method that offers a more comprehensive assessment of behavioral responses when intensive longitudinal data are available. The procedure projects a univariate time-series into discrete states and empirically determines the probability of transitioning from one state to another. State transition probabilities are summarized separately in phase-specific transition matrices. Comparing transition matrices illuminates intricate, quantifiable differences in behavior between intervention phases. Statistical significance is estimated via bootstrapping techniques. This paper introduces the methodology via three case studies from a secondhand smoke reduction trial utilizing real-time air particle sensors. Analysis enabled the identification of complex phenomena such as avoidance and escape behavior in response to punitive contingencies for tobacco use. Additionally, the largest changes in behavior dynamics were associated with the introduction of behavioral feedback. The Markov approach's ability to elucidate subtle behavioral details has not typically been feasible with standard methodologies, mainly due to historical limitations associated with infrequent repeated measures. These results suggest that the evaluation of intervention effects in data-intensive single-case designs can be enhanced, providing rich information that can ultimately be used to develop interventions uniquely tailored to specific individuals.

AB Objective: To develop and evaluate an efficient Trie structure for large-scale, rule-based clinical natural language processing (NLP), which we call n-trie.
   Background: Despite the popularity of machine learning techniques in natural language processing, rule-based systems boast important advantages: distinctive transparency, ease of incorporating external knowledge, and less demanding annotation requirements. However, processing efficiency remains a major obstacle for adopting standard rule-base NLP solutions in big data analyses.
   Methods: We developed n-trie to specifically address the token-based nature of context detection, an important facet of clinical NLP that is known to slow down NLP pipelines. N-trie, a new rule processing engine using a revised Trie structure, allows fast execution of lexicon-based NLP rules. To determine its applicability and evaluate its performance, we applied the n-trie engine in an implementation (called FastContext) of the ConText algorithm and compared its processing speed and accuracy with JavaConText and GeneralConText, two widely used Java ConText implementations, as well as with a standalone machine learning NegEx implementation, NegScope.
   Results: The n-trie engine ran two orders of magnitude faster and was far less sensitive to rule set size than the comparison implementations, and it proved faster than the best machine learning negation detector. Additionally, the engine consistently gained accuracy improvement as the rule set increased (the desired outcome of adding new rules), while the other implementations did not.
   Conclusions: The n-trie engine is an efficient, scalable engine to support NLP rule processing and shows the potential for application in other NLP tasks beyond context detection.

AB Molecular Property Diagnostic Suite - Diabetes Mellitus (MPDSDM) is a Galaxy-based, open source disease-specific web portal for diabetes. It consists of three modules namely (i) data library (ii) data processing and (iii) data analysis tools. The data library (target library and literature) module provide extensive and curated information about the genes involved in type 1 and type 2 diabetes onset and progression stage (available at http://www.mpcls-diabetes.in). The database also contains information on drug targets, biomarkers, therapeutics and associated genes specific to type 1, and type 2 diabetes. A unique MPDS identification number has been assigned for each gene involved in diabetes mellitus and the corresponding card contains chromosomal data, gene information, protein UniProt ID, functional domains, druggability and related pathway information. One of the objectives of the web portal is to have an open source data repository that contains all information on diabetes and use this information for developing therapeutics to cure diabetes. We also make an attempt for computational drug repurposing for the validated diabetes targets. We performed virtual screening of 1455 FDA approved drugs on selected 20 type 1 and type 2 diabetes proteins using docking protocol and their biological activity was predicted using "PASS Online" server (http://www.way2drug.com/passonline) towards anti-diabetic activity, resulted in the identification of 41 drug molecules. Five drug molecules (which are earlier known for anti-malarial/microbial, anti-viral, anti-cancer, anti-pulmonary activities) were proposed to have a better repurposing potential for type 2 anti-diabetic activity and good binding affinity towards type 2 diabetes target proteins.

AB There is an extensive list of methods available for the early detection of an epidemic signal in syndromic surveillance data. However, there is no commonly accepted classification system for the statistical methods used for event detection in syndromic surveillance. Comparing and choosing appropriate event detection algorithms is an increasingly challenging task. Although lists of selection criteria, and statistical methods used for signal detection have been reported, selection criteria are rarely linked to a specific set of appropriate statistical methods. The paper presents a practical approach for guiding surveillance practitioners to make an informed choice from among the most popular event detection algorithms based on the intended application of the algorithm. We developed selection criteria by mapping the assumptions and performance characteristics of event detection algorithms directly to important characteristics of the time series used in syndromic surveillance. We also considered types of epidemics that may be expected and other characteristics of the surveillance system. These guidelines will provide decisions makers, data analysts, public health practitioners, and researchers with a comprehensive but practical overview of the domain, which may reduce the technical barriers to the development and implementation of syndromic surveillance systems in animal and human health. The classification scheme was restricted to univariate and temporal methods because they are the most commonly used algorithms in syndromic surveillance.

AB Background: During medical referrals, communication barriers between referring and consulting outpatient clinics delay patients' access to health care. One notable opportunity for reducing these barriers is improved usefulness and usability of electronic medical consultation order forms. The cognitive systems engineering (CSE) design approach focuses on supporting humans in managing cognitive complexity in sociotechnical systems. Cognitive complexity includes communication, decision-making, problem solving, and planning.
   Objective: The objective of this research was to implement a CSE design approach to develop a template that supports the cognitive needs of referring clinicians and improves referral communication.
   Methods: We conducted interviews and observations with primary care providers and specialists at two major tertiary, urban medical facilities. Using qualitative analysis, we identified cognitive requirements and design guidelines. Next, we designed user interface (UI) prototypes and compared their usability with that of a currently implemented UI at a major Midwestern medical facility.
   Results: Physicians' cognitive challenges were summarized in four cognitive requirements and 13 design guidelines. As a result, two UI prototypes were developed to support order template search and completion. To compare UIs, 30 clinicians (referrers) participated in a consultation ordering simulation complemented with the think-aloud elicitation method. Oral comments about the UIs were coded for both content and valence (i.e., positive, neutral, or negative). Across 619 comments, the odds ratio for the UI prototype to elicit higher-valenced comments than the implemented UI was 13.5 (95% CI = [9.2, 19.8]), p < .001.
   Conclusion: This study reinforced the significance of applying a CSE design approach to inform the design of health information technology. In addition, knowledge elicitation methods enabled identification of physicians' cognitive requirements and challenges when completing electronic medical consultation orders. The resultant knowledge was used to derive design guidelines and UI prototypes that were more useful and usable for referring physicians. Our results support the implementation of a CSE design approach for electronic medical consultation orders.

AB The synergistic effect of drug combination is one of the most desirable properties for treating cancer. However, systematically predicting effective drug combination is a significant challenge. We report here a novel method based on deep belief network to predict drug synergy from gene expression, pathway and the Ontology Fingerprints-a literature derived ontological profile of genes. Using data sets provided by 2015 DREAM competition, our analysis shows that this integrative method outperforms published results from the DREAM website for 4999 drug pairs, demonstrating the feasibility of predicting drug synergy from literature and the-omits data using advanced artificial intelligence approach.

   clinical process
SO JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL INFORMATICS

ID CONFORMANCE CHECKING; TRAUMA; ERRORS
AB Motivation: Prior research has shown that minor errors and deviations from recommended guidelines in complex medical processes can accumulate to increase the likelihood that a major error will go uncorrected and lead to an adverse outcome. Real-time automatic and accurate detection of process deviations may help medical teams better prevent or mitigate the effect of errors and improve patient outcomes. Our goal was to develop an approach for automatic detection of errors and process deviations in trauma resuscitation.
   Methods: Using video review, we coded activity traces of 95 pediatric trauma resuscitations collected in a Level 1 trauma center over two years (2014-2016). Twenty-four randomly selected activity traces were compared with a knowledge-driven model of trauma resuscitation workflow using a phase-based conformance checking algorithm for detecting true and false deviations (alarms). An analysis of false alarms identified three types of causes: (1) model gaps or discrepancies between the model ("work as imagined") and actual practice ("work as done"), (2) errors in activity traces coding, and (3) algorithm limitations. We repaired the system to remove model gaps, reduce coding errors, and address algorithm limitations. The repaired system was first evaluated with another 20 traces and then applied to the entire dataset of 95 traces.
   Results: During the training, we detected 573 process deviations in 24 activity traces that include 1099 activities. Among these deviations, only 27% represented true deviations and the remaining 73% were false alarms. This initial deviation detection accuracy was only 66.6%, with a F-1-score of 0.42. Detection accuracy of the repaired system increased to 95.2% (0.85 F-1-score) during system validation and to 98.5% (0.96 F-1-score) during testing. After deploying the repaired deviation detection system to all 95 activity traces, we detected 1060 process deviations in 5659 activities (11.2 deviations per resuscitation). Among the 5659 activities in these traces, 4893 fit the repaired knowledge-driven workflow model, 294 were errors of omission, 538 were errors of commission, and 228 were scheduling errors.
   Conclusion: Our approach to automatic deviation detection provides a method for identifying repeated, omitted and out-of-sequence activities that can be included in the design of decision support systems for complex medical processes. Our findings show the importance of assessing detected deviations for repairing a knowledge-driven model that best represents "work as done."

AB Modern biomedical data mining requires feature selection methods that can (1) be applied to large scale feature spaces (e.g. 'omits' data), (2) function in noisy problems, (3) detect complex patterns of association (e.g. gene gene interactions), (4) be flexibly adapted to various problem domains and data types (e.g. genetic variants, gene expression, and clinical data) and (5) are computationally tractable. To that end, this work examines a set of filter-style feature selection algorithms inspired by the 'Relief' algorithm, i.e. Relief-Based algorithms (RBAs). We implement and expand these RBAs in an open source framework called ReBATE (Relief-Based Algorithm Training Environment). We apply a comprehensive genetic simulation study comparing existing RBAs, a proposed RBA called MultiStJRF, and other established feature selection methods, over a variety of problems. The results of this study (1) support the assertion that RBAs are particularly flexible, efficient, and powerful feature selection methods that differentiate relevant features having univariate, multivariate, epistatic, or heterogeneous associations, (2) confirm the efficacy of expansions for classification vs. regression, discrete vs. continuous features, missing data, multiple classes, or class imbalance, (3) identify previously unknown limitations of specific RBAs, and (4) suggest that while MultiSURF* performs best for explicitly identifying pure 2-way interactions, MuItiSURF yields the most reliable feature selection performance across a wide range of problem types.

ID COOLING FEATURE-SELECTION; CLASSIFICATION; INFORMATION; ALGORITHM
AB Feature selection plays a critical role in biomedical data mining, driven by increasing feature dimensionality in target problems and growing interest in advanced but computationally expensive methodologies able to model complex associations. Specifically, there is a need for feature selection methods that are computationally efficient, yet sensitive to complex patterns of association, e.g. interactions, so that informative features are not mistakenly eliminated prior to downstream modeling. This paper focuses on Relief-based algorithms (RBAs), a unique family of filter-style feature selection algorithms that have gained appeal by striking an effective balance between these objectives while flexibly adapting to various data characteristics, e.g. classification vs. regression. First, this work broadly examines types of feature selection and defines RBAs within that context. Next, we introduce the original Relief algorithm and associated concepts, emphasizing the intuition behind how it works, how feature weights generated by the algorithm can be interpreted, and why it is sensitive to feature interactions without evaluating combinations of features. Lastly, we include an expansive review of RBA methodological research beyond Relief and its popular descendant, ReliefF. In particular, we characterize branches of RBA research, and provide comparative summaries of RBA algorithms including contributions, strategies, functionality, time complexity, adaptation to key data characteristics, and software availability.

AB Chemical looping steam methane reforming (CL-SMR) is a novel process that uses oxygen carriers to produce synthesis gas and pure hydrogen with low energy consumption. To enhance reactivity and selectivity of oxygen carriers, CeO2-supported BaCoO3-delta perovskite-type oxides (BaCoO3-delta/CeO2) are synthesized by sol-gel method, and gas production in CL-SMR is investigated in a fixed-bed reactor. When compared with pure BaCoO3-delta and CeO2, BaCoO3-delta/CeO2 features higher productions of syngas and hydrogen, and the H-2/CO ratio is closer to the ideal value of 2. Gas production rates and H-2/CO ratios show that optimal reaction temperature is approximately 860 degrees C, and the optimal BaCoO3-delta to CeO2 mass ratio is 1/4. The maximum syngas production in fuel reactor measures 265.11 ml/g (oxygen carrier), whereas hydrogen production in reforming reactor is 82.53 ml/g (oxygen carrier). Perovskite samples were characterized using X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) measurements. XRD results suggest that a part of CeO2 can supply oxygen to BaCoO3-delta for partial oxidation of methane and can be converted to CeO1.675. Co obtained from methane reaction can split water to generate hydrogen. Crystal structure can be recovered during cyclic experiments, and XPS results indicate that lattice oxygen is the primary driver for syngas production. FESEM show that CeO2 particles are coated with BaCoO3-delta perovskite and the morphology of BaCoO3-delta/CeO2 samples does not change during reactions. CeO2 core can supply oxygen to the BaCoO3-delta perovskite, and the synergistic effect of CeO2 and BaCoO3-delta can improve gas production and composition.

AB In this work, the decentralized power generation system consisting of a biomass gasifier, high-temperature proton exchange membrane fuel cells (HT-PEMFCs), and a sorption enhanced water gas shift reactor (SE-WGS) is investigated. With very low CO2 and CO concentrations in the reformate gas, the unconsumed fuel at the anode outlet stream of HT-PEMFC is possibly recirculated to the sorption enhanced water gas shift reactor to improve the performance and overall system efficiency without an increase in the problematic CO poisoning. The effects of CaO/C ratio, fuel utilization, and anode split ratio are analysed. With the anode recirculation, the operation at higher fuel utilization and anode split ratio improves the hydrogen efficiency and the system efficiency. The environmental impacts of the biomass gasification integrated with the SE-WGS and HT-PEMFCs are analysed and compared to the different decentralized HT-PEMFC systems fuelled by biomass using life cycle assessment methodology. The CaO production process is found to be the main cause of global warming impact and damage to human health and ecosystem quality, and no negative effect on resource depletion is observed for all studied power generation systems fuelled by biomass. The implementation of CO2 capture into the decentralized HTPEMFC systems to enhance the hydrogen purity and efficiency significantly increases the environmental impact of the systems. Compared to the Thai Mixed Electricity Grid, better global warming impact of power generation from all studied HT-PEMFC systems is observed due to the environmental benefit obtained from the electricity produced from biomass.

AB One factor in the energy management of smart home is based upon the location of the home occupants. This location information then can be used to control various electrical and electronic devices and appliances. A floor tile is presented which can be used at different locations in the home and can generate enough energy to wirelessly transmit the information to electrical appliance when a person steps on it. In this work, a novel piezoelectric material system of 0.72Pb(Zr0.47Ti0.53)O-3-0.28Pb[(Zn0.45Ni0.55)(1/3)Nb-2/3]O-3 + x mol% CuO (PZNxC) was designed, and the energy harvesting characteristics were tailored through composition driven phase boundary evolution. The rhombohedral-tetragonal phase boundary is the best performance area in terms of energy harvesting, which exhibits an obvious advantage in regards to stable energy harvesting. When a person steps on the floor tile, the peak output voltage and current of 42 V and 11 mu A, was generated. This energy is then utilized to power a wireless sensor node which can control the power on and off function of home appliances in a real-time.

AB Mechanical fragmentation is an important pretreatment step in lignocellulosic biorefinery. In this study, we explored the energy requirement (ER) for mechanical fragmentation of wheat and rice straw at different scales in relation to modifications of microstructure properties and enzymatic hydrolysis. The ER showed a reciprocal relationship with mean particle size (MPZ), but a negative linear relationship with cellulose crystallinity (CrI). An exponential relationship was observed between the ER with a specific surface area (SSA) and the oxygen-to carbon surface ratio (O/C). The results showed that modification of the cellulose crystallinity required the most energy consumption, whereas reduction of particle size consumed the lowest energy. The order of importance of modifications of different microstructure parameters on the ER was: CrI > O/C > pore volume (PV) > SSA > MPZ. Sugar yield showed a clear, positive linear relationship with ER, indicating that grinding patterns with a high ER could significantly enhance the enzymatic hydrolysis yield owing to the plant cell wall deconstruction. The energy efficiency declined with an increasing ER because of the markedly lower increase in sugar yield compared with the corresponding increase in ER.

AB This paper presents an optimization of a high temperature organic Rankine cycle (ORC) system providing the basis for optimal fluid selection and subsequent design parameters based on the working fluid selected. The working fluids used are m-xylene, propylcyclohexane and decane having high critical temperatures. The proposed system deals with the application of biomass due to the high content heat available during its combustion. The system is optimized through non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) by taking the prime operators such as; exergetic efficiency (eta(ex)) to extract maximum work and total heat transfer requirement (UA) to get a prediction of the heat transfer area and hence the cost of the system. The parameters subjected to constraints for optimization are evaporation pressure, degree of superheating and pinch point conditions at heat exchangers. The optimization results exhibit an increase of 22.9% for propylcyclohexane and 45.5% for decane in UA values, relative to m-xylene. Highest exergetic efficiency values for m-xylene among three working fluids further ensures its use in the system as the most viable option from both thermodynamic and economic aspect. Moreover, optimal evaporation pressure range is evaluated by taking the maximum and minimum of exergetic efficiency and UA value, respectively. Both objective functions show negative trend with increase in degree of superheating, with less significant drop. As the pinch point value increases, the UA value decreases showing significantly smaller areas of heat transfer and less cost, but with low exergetic efficiency, therefore, moderate pinch point condition of 8-10 degrees C is recommended.

AB The purpose of this study is to investigate the performance characteristics of subcritical organic Rankine cycle (ORC) based combined heat and power (CHP) system according to a variation of major operating parameters and to confirm the possibility of system performance improvement. The CHP system is designed to provide output using a 200 degrees C heat source, including at least 2 kW of electric power and 25 kW of thermal power with 60 degrees C of hot water supply. Besides examining a basic ORC-based CHP system, variations of system configurations combined with heat exchangers for additional heat recovery have been considered. The effects of changes in superheat and expander volumetric expansion ratio on system performance were evaluated based on thermodynamic analysis and optimization results for each system and working fluids.
   Eight candidate working fluids selected for superior thermophysical properties and environmental impacts were classified into three groups according to the magnitude of latent heat, and four types of CHP system configuration with additional heat exchangers were considered. Group A working fluids with the largest latent heat include cyclopentane, isopentane, n-pentane, and diethyl ether, while medium latent heat group B working fluids include R-1233zd and R-245fa. The smallest latent heat group C working fluids include HFE-7000 and HFE-7100. The operating conditions and performance of the CHP systems were calculated considering the fixed heat source temperature (200 degrees C), the superheat amount, the volumetric expansion ratio and the isentropic efficiency of the expander for parametric analyses.
   Studies have shown that the group A working fluid systems are superior in performance to other fluid systems. According to the parametric analyses, the increase in superheat has a positive effect regardless of the configuration in the system using the group B working fluids. Other working fluid systems can also be expected to enhance the performance by increasing the degree of superheat in system configurations where an internal heat exchanger (IHE) and a post-heater (PH) are employed together. Increasing the volumetric expansion ratio and the isentropic efficiency of the expander improves the performance of all working fluid systems. Especially, it has been concluded that the addition of the post-heater is essential if the CHP performance is to be improved by increasing the volumetric expansion ratio and the isentropic efficiency of the expander.

AB A sorption thermal energy storage (TES) device for domestic heating is presented in this article. The TES device adopts the new design scenario with valve-less adsorber and separate reservoir to eliminate the large-diameter vacuum valve for vapor flow, which decreases the cost, reduces the vapor flow resistance, and improves the system reliability. The device is charged by electric heater, which can add much flexibility to the building energy system as well as contribute to the valley filling and peak shaving from the demand side management. The newly developed composite sorbent of zeolite 13X/MgSO4/ENG-TSA (expanded natural graphite treated with sulfuric acid) with the salt mass fraction of 15% in the zeolite 13X/MgSO4 mixture is tested and used in the TES device (denoted as XM15/ENG-TSA). Experimental results show that the TES device with XM15/ENG-TSA has the energy storage density of 120.3 kWh m(-3) at 250 degrees C charging temperature and 25-90 degrees C discharging temperature. The temperature lift is as high as 65-69 degrees C under the adsorption and evaporating temperatures of 25 degrees C. The impregnated MgSO4 dramatically improves the temperature rising rate during the adsorption heat recovery process, but the specific energy storage capacity of XM15/ENG-TSA is similar to that of zeolite 13X/ENG-TSA. The effect of the impregnated MgSO4 suggests that MgSO4 can be used for low-temperature TES to relieve the self-hindrance of the hydration reaction.

AB Biogas is a promising renewable energy resource. Among the existing biogas utilization technologies, dry reforming can convert two major greenhouse gases in biogas, methane and carbon dioxide, into syngas. In this review, we summarize the recent advances in biogas dry reforming toward hydrogen production, including the preparation of catalysts, the optimization of operation conditions, and the influence of impurities in biogas. The development of bimetallic catalysts and core-shell structure catalysts has become increasingly attractive due to their high catalytic activity and stability. Choosing active metals, supports, and promoters for catalysts is systematically discussed, and different catalyst synthesis methods are compared. Solid waste-derived catalysts have been developed as a new approach to obtain a high added value of solid waste and reduce the costs of catalyst preparation. The influences of reaction temperature, pressure, calcination conditions, reduction conditions, and gas hourly space velocity on dry reforming reactions are discussed in detail. In addition to conventional fixed bed and fluidized bed reactors, several newer reactors are introduced, including membrane reactors, microreactors, and solar thermal flow reactors. Impurities in biogas such as hydrogen sulfide, oxygen, and siloxanes have significant effects on dry reforming. These effects are summarized to improve overall understanding of biogas dry reforming and to provide guidelines for its industrial application in hydrogen energy generation.

AB In wind energy conversion systems, a power curve links the wind speed to the power produced by a wind turbine and an accurate power curve model helps wind power providers to capture the performance of wind turbines. For this purpose, this paper presents the implementation of novel hybrid approaches to the power curve modeling process of wind turbines. As a result of employing the complementary phases called clustering, filtering and modeling in this process, the k-means-based Smoothing Spline hybrid model achieves the most accurate power curve in terms of sum of squared errors, coefficient of determination and root mean squared error. On the other hand, the k-medoids + + -based Gaussian hybrid model causes the most inconsistent power curve in terms of the mentioned goodness-of-fit statistics. Furthermore, all of hybrid power curve models constructed in this paper outperform the conventional linear, quadratic, cubic, exponential and logarithmic benchmark models with the high improvement percentages. Finally, the proposed hybrid power curve models are shown not to be dependent on the initial raw power curve data.

AB This paper presents the energy, exergy, environmental and economic analysis of a proposed agricultural waste to-energy integrated multi-generation power plant. The proposed plant will use agro-wastes composed of selected crops and animals wastes from a farm in Rivers state, Nigeria (latitude 4.44 degrees N, longitude 7.1 degrees E). Combined anaerobic digestion and gasification was used in converting the agro-wastes to synthetic gas, and subsequently converted to electrical energy and refrigeration in an integrated multi-generation plant composed of solid oxide fuel cell stack, gas turbine, steam turbine, organic Rankine and absorption refrigeration cycles. The lower heating value of the syngas is estimated as 23.47 MJ/kg; the proposed plant had a net power of 5.226 MW, energy and exergy efficiencies of 63.62 and 58.46%, respectively. The highest exergy destruction rate was in the combustion chamber with a contribution of 15% to the overall exergy destructed. Life cycle cost of $3.753 million, breakeven point of 7.5 years and unit energy cost of $0.0109 per kWh were obtained. Environmental analysis showed specific emission of CO2 of 141.2 kg/MWh and sustainability exponent of 3.65, with exit flue gas stack temperature of 60.4 degrees C, respectively. The paper introduced energo-environmental sustainability and energo-economic sustainability exponents to holistically assess the sustainability of the proposed plants.

AB Catalytic steam gasification of biomass can produce clean and renewable hydrogen. In this study, Ce/Fe bimetallic catalysts were used to promote hydrogen production from cellulose steam catalytic reforming at 500-900 degrees C. The effect of different Ce/Fe ratios on the catalytic performance of hydrogen production was studied. The distribution of products, gas composition, carbon deposition and the stability of the catalyst were analyzed with variant approaches. The results show that the catalytic performance of the CeO2/Fe2O3 catalyst in relation to hydrogen production was much better than pure CeO2 or Fe2O3. When the ratio of Ce:Fe was 3:7, the maximum yield of the H-2 was 28.58 mmol at 800 degrees C. CeFeO3 could be generated at 800 degrees C or higher temperature after redox reactions without forming CeO2/Fe2O3 clathrate. And the existence of CeFeO3 enhanced the thermal stability of Ce/Fe catalyst. The presence of CeO2 not only improved the oxidative ability of the iron catalysts, but also was in favour of the oxidation of possible deposited carbon on the surface of the used catalysts.

AB In recent years, nanoscale particles have been applied in the utilisation of solar energy due to their excellent properties. In light of the multiple functions of composite nanoparticles, some solar-assisted systems have been developed and exhibited comprehensive photoelectric and photo-thermal transformation effects. However, the presence of nanoparticles in these systems can cause secondary pollution and severely limit large-scale application of the solar technology. Herein we developed a recyclable photo-thermal conversion and purification system based on Fe3O4 nanoparticles decorated with TiO2 nanoparticles, which could be separated from water under the action of a magnetic force. Under the solar illumination power of 1 sun (1 sun = 1000 W.m(-2)), thermal receiver efficiency of 76.4% and Rhodamine B degradation efficiency of 85% were obtained with a 0.1 g/L Fe3O4@TiO2 nanofluid. With the increase of the solar illumination power, the degradation efficiency has been increased to 94%. The recovery rate and efficiency could be controlled by adjusting the magnetic field strength and the magnetic property of Fe3O4@TiO2 nanoparticles. This study provides an approach to not only significantly reduce material consumption in the design of solar devices, but also to realise broad solar energy applications for water purification and photo-thermal conversion.

AB A new combined system model is proposed to numerically assess the feasibility and effectiveness of using a thermophotovoltaic cell (TPVC) for waste heat recovery from a direct carbon solid oxide fuel cell (DC-SOFC). The system model mainly consists of an irreversible TPVC model and a 2D tubular DC-SOFC model considering the ionic/electronic charge transport, mass transport, momentum transport, and chemical/electrochemical reactions. Mathematical expressions of the power density and efficiency for the proposed system are derived and the performance characteristics of the combined system are revealed. The impacts of operation conditions and designing parameters including the operating temperature of the DC-SOFC, distance between the carbon layer and anode, and band-gap energy of the TPVC on the combined system performance are examined. It is found that the TPVC can efficiently harvest the waste heat from the DC-SOFC. The maximum power density of the combined system is approximately 56.2% larger than that of the stand-alone DC-SOFC. Moreover, a higher operating temperature of the DC-SOFC and a smaller distance between the carbon layer and the anode are beneficial to the performance enhancement of the combined system. The power density of the combined system can be further improved through designing the TPVC with an optimum band gap.

AB Phase change behaviors of organic phase change materials (PCMs) confined in porous silica matrices, which are determined by the pore characteristics as well as interfacial interactions between PCM molecules and supporting solid, are crucial to PCMs for thermal energy storage performance. In this paper, a series of shape-stabilized phase change materials (ss-PCMs) were engineered with three silica matrices as support and paraffin as PCMs through solution impregnation. These porous silica matrices serve as an ideal skeleton for shape stabilization of melted paraffin PCMs and yield desirable thermal properties of paraffin confined in silica pores. The textural and chemical properties, crystallization, interfacial interactions, and thermal properties and stability are investigated using various techniques including nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms, Fourier transformation infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy, small- and wide-angle X-ray diffraction (XRD), and scanning electron microscopy, as well as differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) analysis. The effect of the pore structure on crystallization of PCMs was studied and a novel phase change was unveiled. The phenomena of melting point depression and confinement effects are in line with theoretical thermodynamics, and the physical state of paraffin at the interfacial region in mesopore channel is analyzed considering pore geometric factors, revealing a non-melting interface layer in MCM-41. This evaluation of various silica matrices may provide important and general implications for the fundamental understanding of porous silica ss-PCMs performance with cost-effective and readily available raw materials.

AB In this paper, melting and solidification processes of phase change material embedded in metallic porous foam in a multi-tube heat exchanger are investigated numerically under local non-equilibrium thermal condition. RT 35 is used as phase change material in middle shell of 3D multi-tube heat exchanger. Also, water flows across inner tube/tubes and outer tube as a heat transfer fluid (HTF). The effects of number of inner tubes, their arrangement as well as porosity of metallic foam on thermal characteristics of heat storage unit are studied. Results show that increasing number of inner tubes and adding metallic foam enhance melting and solidification rates significantly. A composite of phase change material/metallic foam with porosity of epsilon = 0.7 engenders shorter melting and solidification time comparing to pure PCM. Arrangement of inner tubes has no effect on melting rate of metal foam/PCM composite. By inserting metallic foam with porosities epsilon = 0.9and epsilon = 0.7, melting time is decreased by 14% and 55%, respectively. Highest melting rate is for case with four inner tubes for all porosities of metallic foam. Regarding solidification process in pure PCM, case with four tubes shows shorter solidification time. Also, highest solidification rate amid composites of phase change material/metallic foam is seen for case with three tubes. Consequently, inserting metallic foam is more efficient in solidification process rather than the melting one. Moreover, increasing number of inner tubes has more influence on phase change rates in metal foam/PCM composites compared to pure PCM.

AB Tidal current turbine has attracted many attentions, but the impact of Darrieus-type tidal current turbine on the seabed scour process still remains unclear. This work aims to propose an empirical model, which can be used to predict the maximum scour depth against different tip clearance and rotor radius. The study also presents the scour profiles along centreline of turbine by using the proposed empirical equations. A series of three-dimensional printed turbine models were placed in a circulating water flume to investigate the scour profiles. The results suggest that the scour depth increases with the decrease of tip clearance. When the turbine is installed very close to seabed, the scour process is live bed scour with the collapse of the slant bed. Under this kind of condition, the maximum scour depth will not further increase with the continuous decrease of tip clearance. The current experimental results propose that the maximum scour depth is about 80% deeper than scour depth around single pile. The maximum scour depth increases firstly and then decreases with the increase of rotor radius. Based on experimental results, an empirical model of Darrieus-type tidal current turbine induced seabed scour is proposed to predict the maximum scour depth and scour profiles along centreline of turbine.

AB The main purpose of the present study is to propose a combined cooling; heating and power cycle in microscale to be portable, maintenance free, undetectable, environmentally friendly and can provide the energy demand of a single-family when access to energy suppliers is limited. The prime mover of the cycle is a polymer exchange membrane fuel cell. Heat is recovered from a low-quality waste of 80 degrees C and water condensate is also recovered from the electrochemical products for domestic hot water. A thermoelectric cooler is used as the cooling system. The mathematical models of the fuel cell and the thermoelectric cooler are coded and the results of simulations are validated with the published data in the literature. The results show that the models are qualified and they can be trusted to be combined for proposing a new micro combined cooling, heating, and power system. The results show that the cycle is capable of producing 2.79 kW of electricity, 3.04 kW of heat and 26.8 W of cooling. The overall efficiency of the trigeneration cycle has reached 76.94% and a fuel saving of 43.25% is achieved. The exergy efficiency is 53.86%. In addition, the carbon dioxide production has reduced about 2.58 kg. hr(-1). The overall weight of the proposed cycle is estimated less than 100 kg. The exergy analysis introduces the fuel cell as the most exergy destructor.

AB Joint operation of large-scale renewable energy sources (e.g., hydro and solar) has become a trend in modem power systems, and more operators of existing hydropower reservoir systems are adopting it. This study aimed to improve guidance for the daily generation scheduling of a large hydro-photovoltaic (PV) power plant. First, a robust optimization model that accounts for uncertain PV power generation was formulated, in which the delivered power output of the hybrid system and hydro unit status are robust decision variables. To deal with the complexity of the model solution, a three-layer nested framework was proposed to solve the generation scheduling problem in a hierarchical structure. In the outer layer, a direct search algorithm optimizes the delivered power output of the system, aiming to maximize energy production while satisfying specified load characteristics. In the middle and inner layers, a cuckoo search algorithm and dynamic programming technique optimize the hydro unit status and load dispatch strategies, respectively, with the objective of minimizing water consumption. Finally, a decision interval on delivered power output of the system was derived by relaxing the load characteristic constraint. Results for a case study using China's Longyangxia hydro-PV power plant indicated that the robust optimization model and the three-layer nested approach could provide effective power generation plans for the hybrid system within a reasonable time. Compared with actual operation, the power generation plans could increase energy production of the hybrid system by 1.9% while decreasing total online time of the hydro units by 9.7%. Therefore, the proposed method could improve guidance for the hydro-PV power plant's generation scheduling. In practice, conjunctive use of the power generation plan and the decision interval could also inform flexible decision-making for plant operations management.

AB Carbonated alumina doped by calcium oxide was successfully synthesized by a simple, cost effective and rapid microwave combustion method (MCM) and the effect of fuel type on the structural and performance of the sample in the microwave-assisted transesterification reaction were examined. For this purpose, five kinds of fuel as carbon source such as citric acid, starch, triethylene glycol, sorbitol and dextrose were utilized for fabrication of carbonated calcium aluminate and then active phase of KOH was dispersed on the surface of samples by impregnation method. The results of TG/DSC, XRD, FTIR, BET-BJH, FESEM and EDX analyses mentioned that the sample synthesized by dextrose, sorbitol and triethylene glycol presented well-crystalline structure, surface area, pore size and activity, respectively. While, the sample prepared by citric acid and starch showed insufficient physicochemical properties that can be assigned to flash point, auto-ignition temperature and proportion of oxygen to carbon of the fuel. Assessment the activity of the sample prepared by dextrose exhibited that 98.8% of canola oil was converted to biodiesel at the conditions of 270 W microwave power, 15 M ratios of methanol/oil, 4 wt% of catalyst and 30 min reaction time. Moreover, the sample presented the highest stability compared to those prepared by other fuels such that its activity reduced only 3.4% and 6.1% after second and third uses, while 9.2%, 16.6%, 15.6% and 27.8% reduction in the activity were respectively observed for carbonated calcium aluminate prepared by sorbitol, triethylene glycol, starch and citric acid as fuel.

AB Solar-driven desalination is a potential solution to the problem of freshwater scarcity in many parts of the world. However, this technology requires considerable efforts to overcome a number of technical challenges such as high-energy consumption, intermittency of solar radiation, and high-water consumption. This paper proposes an optimized multi-effect distillation (MED) process driven by steam at 70 degrees C and 0.3 bar, which is provided by a linear Fresnel collector. The aim of the proposed integrated system is to reduce the equivalent mechanical energy of the MED process, and utilize the most cost-effective storage system. Moreover, we incorporated an air-cooled condenser instead of a water-cooled condenser, to reduce the water cooling facilities. A computer model was developed using the Engineering Equation Solver tool, to solve the mass and energy balance equations of the integrated system (under different operating conditions). Under the operating conditions of Qatar, the simulation results showed that 1 m(2) of solar linear Fresnel collector produces 8.6 m(3) of freshwater per year. The equivalent mechanical energy of the optimized MED desalination plant is 8 kWh/m(3), which is 59% lower than that of existing commercial MED facilities with thermal vapor compression (19 kWh/m(3)). This significant reduction in equivalent energy consumption would reduce the required solar field size by 25%. This study also showed that using a water storage system (instead of thermal energy storage) results in a lower total system capital cost. Furthermore, by integrating an air-cooled condenser, the overall plant water consumption reduced by 2 m(3) of sea water per m(3) of feed water. The performance of the air-cooled condenser can vary by as much as 300% due to fluctuations in dry-bulb temperature and relative humidity.

AB The main challenges of wastewater treatment plants are high-energy demand and sludge disposal. A hybrid system for sewage sludge drying is proposed in this work to face both these issues. The developed layout is based on the integration of two renewable energy sources, biogas from anaerobic digestion of sludge and solar energy in order to increase sustainability and energy self-sufficiency of the plant. Biogas is used to fuel a combined heat and power system and solar energy is exploited through a parabolic trough collector field. Electrical energy produced by the combined heat and power is used to cover the plant demand, whereas thermal energy coming from the combined heat and power unit and solar field is employed to run an anaerobic digestion process and for thermal drying of the residual sludge. The considered case study is based on data collected for an existing wastewater treatment plant. The proposed system is studied through data obtained from the scientific literature, suppliers of the considered equipment and properly developed sub-models of the various components, to assess its feasibility and the overall energy, environmental and economic performance. The system is dynamically simulated and daily, weekly and yearly results are presented. For the considered desiccant flow temperatures, the solar collector field achieves a thermal efficiency of about 56.0%, while for the combined heat and power unit it is about 44.0%, which is slightly higher than the nominal one, due to the preheating of combined heat and power unit intake air. The integration of solar energy with the combined heat and power system leads to a primary energy saving of about 14.6% with respect to the existing plant, where the sludge is not digested and neither thermally dried. The economic analysis shows that the Simple Pay Back period of the system is less than 3.40 years.

   METHODOLOGY
AB National electrification plans for many countries with a low level of electrification promote the implementation of centralized and decentralized electrification in parallel. This paper explores different ways of utilizing an established off-grid PV-diesel hybrid system when the national grid becomes available. This is a rather unique starting point within the otherwise well-explored area of rural electrification. With particular focus on the impact of blackouts in the national grid, we evaluate the economic viability of some alternatives: to continue to use the off-grid micro-grid, to connect the existing micro-grid with or without battery backup to the national grid, or to use the national grid only. Our simulation results in HOMER demonstrate that with a grid without blackouts, there are few benefits to maintain the existing system. Low grid-connection fees, low tariffs and low revenues from selling excess electricity to the grid contribute to this result despite the fact that the system does not carry any investment costs. With a grid with blackouts, it is beneficial to maintain the system. The extent of blackouts and the load on the system determine which system configuration is most feasible. The results make clear the importance of taking blackouts in the national grid into consideration when possible system configurations are being evaluated. This is rarely quantified in studies comparing different electrification alternatives, but deserves more attention.

AB Worldwide efforts are being made for evolving viable electricity generation alternative to the traditional fossil fuel based power generation systems and also to enhance the efficiency of existing power generation systems. Studies have been made for integrating fuel cell with gas turbine cycle and Organic Rankine cycle, but there exist possibility of further investigation by incorporating the measures to increase effective energy utilization in the cycle along with consideration of different working fluids in Organic Rankine cycle. In the present paper, a combined cycle system consisting of technologies namely solid oxide fuel cell, gas turbine and Organic Rankine cycle is studied. The considered combined cycle system employs Heat Recovery Steam Generator followed by Organic Rankine cycle as bottoming cycle for recovering the waste heat coming out from hybrid SOFC-GT system through a Heat Recovery Vapour Generator. The considered SOFC-GT system has methane gas being used as fuel which is reformed by both external and internal reformers with anode gas recycling. Here three different working fluids namely R141b, R245fa and R236fa are used in bottoming Organic Rankine cycle for comparing their effects on the cycle performance of proposed SOFC-GT-ORC combined cycle system based on first law of the thermodynamics. Results have been obtained from the computer simulation based on thermodynamic modeling of SOFC-GT-ORC combined cycle and the effects of gas turbine inlet temperature, cycle pressure ratio, fuel utilization factor and ORC turbine inlet temperature are investigated on the cycle performance. The study indicates that the efficiency is increased about 8%-12% by recovering SOFC-GT waste heat through ORC and R236fa is found to be the best in terms of power generation capacity and efficiency of SOFC-GT-ORC system. Outcome from this paper gives insight to the power sector professionals and research community working for evolving efficient and robust power generation alternatives based on the combination of direct energy conversion system and indirect energy conversion system.

AB This paper proposes novel microencapsulated phase change material slurries (MPCSs) as both the energy storage media and heat transfer fluids. The flow and heat transfer characteristics of MPCSs have been experimentally investigated. A series of experiments were conducted in laminar, transition and turbulent flow conditions for MPCSs in a circular tube under constant heat flux, respectively. The results of pressure drop measurements showed that transportation costs of slurries were close to pure water. The heat transfer experiments demonstrated that proposed MPCSs could enhance the heat transfer performance as the heat transfer fluids for thermal system applications in comparison with pure water. The average enhancement percentages of the Nusselt number were 23.9%, 20.5% and 9.1% for MPCS of 5 wt%, and enhancement of the Nusselt number was achieved when phase change material in the microcapsules were in solid, solid/liquid and liquid states, respectively. However, heat transfer enhancement of MPCS depends on the following combination factors: the slurry concentration, the flow rate, the pumping power and the heating rate. Importantly, the phase change process must be carefully controlled in the heat transfer test section with above combination factors in order to take advantages of MPCS over pure water.

AB The two-phase flow in the primary converging-diverging nozzle of a transcritical CO2 ejector was investigated by a visualization measurement experiment using the direct photography method. The transition of the phase change position in the primary nozzle was discovered experimentally and analyzed theoretically based on the isentropic expansion process. The pressure distribution along the primary nozzle was measured by the pressure sensors simultaneously under different operating conditions. The expansion state of the primary flow and the nozzle outlet quality were studied by comparing the nozzle outlet pressure with the suction flow inlet pressure. The visualization images revealed that the phase change could start after or before the throat according to the operating conditions, which was consistent with the isentropic analysis results. In addition, the phase change position moved upwards when the primary flow inlet pressure and temperature decreased simultaneously. The pressure measurement results found that the nozzle outlet pressure was obviously higher than the suction flow inlet pressure in the experiment, which indicated that the primary flow was under-expanded in the primary nozzle. The nozzle outlet quality calculated with the nozzle outlet pressure was less than that calculated with the suction flow inlet pressure. The visualization experiment can be used to improve the CO2 ejector geometry and provide useful data for CO2 ejector model validation to better interpret the internal complex flow phenomena.

AB Thermal energy storage systems (TES) find their extensive application in industrial and solar-powered thermal systems due to their high energy storage density and ability to deliver heat at isothermal conditions. But, the lower thermal conductivity of phase change materials (PCM) reduces the overall rate of heat transfer. In the present work, solidification behavior in a medium temperature (160-200 degrees C) finned TES with varying proportion of Graphene nano plates (GNP) is presented. The effect of anisotropy, aspect ratio, concentration, interfacial thermal resistance and non-linearity has been included to evaluate the overall thermal conductivity of GNP-PCM composite. The objective of the present study is to enhance the solidification process of a binary eutectic salt LiNO3-KCl in an optimized finned TES dispersed with the different volume fraction of GNP. The detailed experimentation process starts with the preparation of binary eutectic mixture, followed by dynamic Differential scanning calorimetry analyses along with rheology testing. Empirical correlations have been developed using quadratic and cubic polynomials for viscosity and specific heat respectively. Several numerical models are analyzed to study the solidification enhancement of binary eutectic PCM using the real-time plant data of a high temperature solar absorption chiller. Effects of Stefan and Reynolds number on the thermal performance of storage system has also been studied. Reducing the Stefan number and increasing the Reynolds number of heat transfer fluid (HTF) results in enhancing the rate of solidification process. It has been observed that natural convection currents enhances the rate of solidification and causes faster solidification in the upper annulus of TES. A reduction of 49% in the solidification time has been observed with finned TES dispersed with 5% GNP as compared to pure binary eutectic PCM.

AB The comprehensive understanding of the residential electricity consumption patterns (ECPs) and how they relate to household characteristics can contribute to energy efficiency improvement and electricity consumption reduction in the residential sector. After recognizing the limitations of current studies (i.e. unreasonable typical ECP (TECP) extraction method and the problem of multicollinearity and interpretability for regression and machine learning models), this paper proposes an association rule mining based quantitative analysis approach of household characteristics impact on residential ECPs trying to address them together. First, an adaptive density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) algorithm is utilized to create seasonal TECP of each individual customer only for weekdays. K-means is then adopted to group all the TECPs into several clusters. An enhanced Apriori algorithm is proposed to reveal the relationships between TECPs and thirty five factors covering four categories of household characteristics including dwelling characteristics, socio-demographic, appliances and heating and attitudes towards energy. Results of the case study using 3326 records containing smart metering data and survey information in Ireland suggest that socio-demographic and cooking related factors such as employment status, occupants and whether cook by electricity have strong significant associations with TECPs, while attitudes related factors almost have no effect on TECPs. The results also indicate that those households with more than one person are more likely to change ECP across seasons. The proposed approach and the findings of this study can help to support decisions about how to reduce electricity consumption and CO2 emissions.

AB Fast pyrolysis of wheat straw in an original dual concentric rotary cylinder (DCRC) reactor with ceramic balls as recirculated heat carriers was studied to access the performance of this unit and explore the product yields and and characteristics in response to temperature. In addition, the performance of the novel bio-oil recovery mode (NBRM) was evaluated and compared with the spray quenching mode. Detailed composition of the bio-oils obtained under optimal conditions by using the NBRM was also analyzed. The DCRC reactor along with the novel bio-oil recovery procedure was successfully scaled up to a 25 kg/h pilot plant and showed good performance. The bio-oil yield was elevated by 21.4% when raising temperature from 400 to 500 degrees C with the peak value of 47.6 wt%. The prevailing components of pyrolysis gas are CO2 and CO, both of which account for at least 75 vol%, with the lower heating values increasing from 6.2 MJ/m(3) at 400 degrees C to 13.6 MJ/m(3) at 700 degrees C. Compared to the spray quenching way, the bio-oil yields were always elevated at different temperatures when using the NBRM and the increase rate showed an unceasing increase from 2.8% at 400 degrees C to 9.6% at 700 degrees C, which confirmed the better performance of NBRM in response to more pyrolysis vapors generated at higher temperatures. The obtained results provided valuable insights into the fundamentals of biomass pyrolysis in the DCRC reactor, as well as the scale-up and technology breakthrough of the originally developed unit.

AB This article considers the scheme of a gas turbine unit (GTU) with a thermochemical exhaust heat recuperation system by using steam methane reforming. The main concept of thermochemical recuperation (TCR) is the transformation of exhaust gases heat into chemical energy of a new synthetic fuel that has higher calorimetric properties such as low-heating value. As an example, the gas turbine plants with turbines where the exhaust gas temperature exceeds 900 K are considered. To determine the optimum operating parameters of the thermochemical exhaust recuperation system, the influence of temperature, pressure, and inlet reaction mixture composition on the recuperation rate are determined. Based on thermodynamic analysis, the amount of exhaust heat that is transformed into chemical energy of the new synthetic fuel for various operating parameters is calculated. The thermodynamic analysis is performed by minimizing Gibbs energy via the programs IVTANT-HERMO and Aspen HYSYS. The results of the thermodynamic analysis are verified with the results obtained by the analytical calculation of other authors based on the law of mass action and the law of mass and energy conservation. As a result of the calculation, it was established that in the temperature range (900-1000) K the recuperation rate reaches a maximum value for the inlet reaction mixture composition of H2O: CH4 = 2; in the temperature range of above 1200 K, at H2O:CH4 = 1. It is also established that when the pressure in the reaction space increases, the energy efficiency of the use of TCR is reduced; the optimum pressure is in the range of (5-10) bar. The maximum recuperation rate of the TCR system (R = 0.693) is observed at T = 900 K, beta = 2, p = 5 bar.

AB Zeotropic mixtures and turbine expander were two hot topics in organic Rankine cycle (ORC) field recently. However, few researches referred the design of turbine expander with zeotropic mixtures. In this paper, R245fa, R123 and three mixtures (0.25R245fa/0.75R123, 0.5R245fa/0.5R123, 0.75R245fa/0.25R123) are used as working fluid to investigate the performance of a partially admitted turbine consisting of 3 nozzles and 30 blades. The mean-line diameter of turbine is 0.1 m and the height of blade is 14 mm. The 3D simulation are carried out with ANSYS CFX using k-omega turbulence model and SRK real gas model. Results show that turbine has maximum power output of 8.1336 kW and maximum efficiency of 55.3% with pure R245fa used as working fluid. When the mass fraction of R245fa is 0.25, mixture has the maximum glide temperature of 3 K, while turbine has maximum power output gain of 7.87%, maximum mass flow rate gain of 3.57%, maximum Ma number of 2.19 and maximum mass flow rate of 0.5287 kg/s. The results of system analysis coupling with the designed turbine show that the maximum thermal efficiency, maximum net work and minimum exergy destruction factor are 6.15%, 7.6771 kW and 2.41 respectively for the best working condition.

AB A novel combined supercritical carbon dioxide recompression Brayton/organic flash cycle is investigated by means of exergoeconomic analysis. The supercritical carbon dioxide recompression Brayton/organic flash cycle is a combination of a supercritical carbon dioxide recompression Brayton cycle and an organic flash cycle where the organic flash cycle absorbs waste heat from the supercritical carbon dioxide recompression Brayton cycle for power generation. Seven different organic flash cycle working fluids are examined, including n-Nonane, n-Octane, n-Heptane, n-Hexane, n-Pentane, R365mfc and R245fa. Parametric study is employed to investigate the effects of the some decision variables on the first and second law efficiencies and the total product unit cost of the supercritical carbon dioxide recompression Brayton/organic flash cycle and the supercritical carbon dioxide recompression Brayton cycle. The performances of the supercritical carbon dioxide recompression Brayton/organic flash cycle and the supercritical carbon dioxide recompression Brayton cycle are optimized and then compared from the perspective of thermodynamics and exergoeconomics. The results show that the second law efficiency and the total product unit cost of the supercritical carbon dioxide recompression Brayton/organic flash cycle are up to 6.57% higher and up to 3.75% lower than those of the supercritical carbon dioxide recompression Brayton cycle, respectively. Compared with the supercritical carbon dioxide recompression Brayton/organic Rankine cycle, the supercritical carbon dioxide recompression Brayton/organic flash cycle can obtain slightly higher second law efficiency, and comparable or slightly lower total product unit cost. It can also be concluded that the highest second law efficiency and the lowest total product unit cost for the supercritical carbon dioxide recompression Brayton/organic flash cycle are achieved when the n-Nonane is used as the organic flash cycle working fluid.

AB Biodiesel was produced in laboratory in two consecutive steps i.e. esterification followed by transesterification using a novel heterogeneous base catalyst and Madhuca indica (Mahua) oil as a feedstock. Barium lanthanum oxide, a novel catalyst was synthesized by four different methods i.e., co-precipitation (BLOC), solid state (BLOS) and the citrate route or auto-combustion method (BLOA1 and BLOA2). The catalyst was characterized and the catalytic activity was measured by quantifying the FAME content of the biodiesel. It has been observed that BLOA1, BLOA2, and BLOC resemble with each other as they have the same phase with an identical structural formula of Ba2La2O5. This observed structural formula constituted the mixture of the perovskite and metal oxides. The BLOS sample had the structural formula of Ba10La2O13 which proved the extensive formation of individual metal oxides. Out of the samples, BLOA2 synthesized by citrate route was efficient in biodiesel production. The citrate route synthesis performed at pH 2.31 enriched the catalyst mixed metal oxide surface with free OH- groups, which ultimately avoided the formation of the carbonate species, produced biodiesel with 97.5% FAME conversion. Hence, Barium Lanthanum Mixed metal oxide prepared by citrate route in acidic medium is a potential catalyst for biodiesel production. The reaction mechanism followed first-order kinetics. The activation energy (E-A) was 34.44 kJ mol(-1) and the frequency factor (A) was 7.94 min(-1). The physicochemical properties of the synthesized Mahua oil methyl ester (MOME) were measured according to ASTM D 6751 and were found to be within the permissible range.

AB In this work, we have undertaken a dual-mode combined heat and power unit commitment model to address the optimum generation scheduling of the committed unit. The model formulation includes the backpressure and an extraction mode of cogeneration unit, which is having a diverse feasible operating region of operation. In backpressure mode, the energy generated from the combined heat and power unit depends on a fixed ratio of power and heat, while in extraction mode, this ratio is relatively relaxed that provides system flexibility as compared to other. Owing to the dynamic features of different generating units as well as combination of binary and continuous decision variables, the problem becomes mixed-integer nondeterministic polynomial hard optimization problem, hence an integrated optimization technique has been applied. The integrated optimization technique is a combination of binary successive approximation technique and civilized swarm optimization technique. The binary successive approximation as a local search technique is used to update the unit status, iteratively and global search technique 'civilized swarm optimization' are applied to search optimal generation schedule from the committed units. In order to measure the impact of a dual-mode combined heat and power unit on optimum generation scheduling and system flexibility, four test systems have been undertaken. It has been observed from results that total operating cost of the system during extraction mode of combined heat and power unit is less as compared to backpressure mode. It is also evident from the results, that system provides diverse flexibility in terms of power and heat capability, during the extraction and backpressure mode of operation.

AB The development of Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) techniques is continuing in order to increase the generated energy from photovoltaic (PV) generators. A variety of MPPT techniques have been proposed and classified based on three main categories: offline, online and hybrid techniques. This paper presents a review of the most popular techniques for offline and online tracking of the Maximum Power Point (MPP), which are the Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) and Hill Climbing (HC) techniques, respectively. This is in addition to a review for all hybrid techniques reported in the literature demonstrating their main merits and shortcomings. Moreover, the present paper combines the ANFIS and HC as a hybrid technique for the first time. The proposed technique involves the features of the ANFIS and HC techniques and mitigates their shortcomings in order to increase the generated PV electrical energy. The proposed technique is a combination of two stages to assess the duty ratio (control signal) being applied to a boost converter for MPP tracking. The first stage includes a set point calculation loop to estimate the duty ratio. The second stage involves a fine tuning loop to determine the exact duty ratio corresponding to the MPP. This achieves maximum power transfer to the load even under nonuniform climatic conditions using a relatively simple control system. The proposed technique has been simulated in MATLAB/SIMULINK environment and compared with some other MPPT techniques (the Constant Voltage (CV), ANFIS, HC, Incremental Conductance (IncCond) techniques) for steady state and rapidly changing climatic conditions (Ropp and sine radiation tests) as well as load variations. The results reveal that the proposed hybrid MPPT technique outperforms other MPPT techniques in term of performances indicators, which include the tracking speed, tracking accuracy and energy gain factor.

AB The NiO-yttrium stabilized zirconia (YSZ) anode substrates prepared by tape casting are modified via laser machining technique in mesoscale for electrode-electrolyte interface modification. Two different surface processing methods are applied: (i) scanning the whole surface with continuous tracks to produce a "coarser" surface; (ii) engraving spots on the substrates surface forming "pits array". The microstructure and electrical performance of the cells based on these anode substrates are investigated. For the scanned anode, confocal laser scanning microscope (CLSM) images show that the surface roughness increases with the laser intensity. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of single cells show that electrode-electrolyte interface contact area is increased. Compared with the unmodified cell, the maximum power density of the cells fabricated with "coarser" anode substrates is improved by 47% at 800 degrees C. For the second case, the SEM images of cross-section of single cells show that the electrode-electrolyte interface is wavy, resulting increase in the electrochemically active area. It's found that the degree of performance enhancement of the cells is related to the pits size, and a suitable diameter and depth of the pits are needed. The highest power density of the cells with "pits array" increases by 55% at 800 degrees C. In both cases, electrochemistry impedance spectroscopy (EIS) results show that ohmic and polarization resistances of single cells are decreased after modification.

AB The primary purpose of present work is to evaluate and optimize the internal reversible combined cycle in operational conditions. Therefore, the effects of finite heat transfer are considered in different heat exchangers. In this study, the problem of the irreversible combined cycle is discussed by different heat exchangers. The total power of the combined cycle, energy efficiency, exergy destruction and the ecological function are calculated based on decision variables including the primary temperature ratio, secondary temperature ratio, and common temperature ratio and thermal conductance of combined cycle heat exchangers. Mono-objective optimization was performed based on simplex, conjugate-direction, and genetic algorithm methods. For the optimization of multi-objective ecological function, it is used from the elitist non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II). Results of Mono-objective optimization demonstrate that the maximum dimensionless power, maximum efficiency in simplex, conjugate-direction and genetic algorithm methods, minimum exergy destruction are approximately 0.1855, 77.14%, 75.91%, 72.11%, 0.0007804, respectively. Furthermore, results of multi-objective optimization of the ecological by NSGA-II show that the dimensionless power, energy efficiency, exergy destruction, and the ecological function is about 0.14, 68.21%, 0.0091 and 0.1312 in the graphical method of decision making. In order to select the optimal solution, the technique for order preferences by similarity to an ideal solution (TOPSIS) method is used. As a result, the dimensionless power, energy efficiency, exergy destruction and the ecological function is approximately 0.1216, 70%, 0.0061, and 0.1155 by TOPSIS method. For the design and development of combined cycles, finite time thermodynamics and analysis criteria such as dimensionless power and ecological function are used. Finite time thermodynamics can be a new tool for designing combined cycles. This research shows the importance of choosing the thermodynamic criterion.

AB The design of a combined Otto-Stirling system with the aim of simultaneous production of power and cooling using the waste energy of exhaust gases is presented. The internal combustion (IC) engine is modeled using a Previously developed analytical thermal model. The Stirling engine and cooler are modeled using a new developed second-order thermal model called modified CAFS model. The modified CAFS model predicts the thermal efficiency with 2.74% relative error and output power with 12.27% error. The final thermal model of the hybrid Stirling-Otto engine is employed to design the hybrid system in two scenarios. In one scenario, it is assumed that the IC engine has a bottoming Stirling engine. While in the other scenario, in addition to the bottoming Stirling engine, a Stirling cooler is employed as a non-CFC alternative for cars' A/C systems. Both Stirling engine and cooler of two scenarios are optimized for highest power generation, heat recovery, and coefficient of performance. Two scenarios are assessed based on the fuel saving, emission reduction, and economic aspects. It is seen that in the best scenario, CO2 emission and fuel consumption will decrease by 27.6% and 15.3%, respectively.

AB In present work, a simplistic, efficient and highly durable electroactive and high dielectric BaF2 nanoparticles (NPs) incorporated polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) thin film based Self-Charged Hybrid Photo-Power Cell (HPPC) has been designed which is able to self-charge under visible light illumination. The incorporation of NPs into the PVDF matrix has effectively enhanced the polar beta crystallite nucleation (similar to 96%) and the dielectric value (similar to 2570) of the PVDF thin film. A composite dye film of TiO2 NPs, phenosafranine-polyvinyl pyrrolidone in the presence of H3PO4 is acted as the light absorbing and photoelectrons generating part in the HPPC. The photoelectrons are stored in the energy storage part made of the in situ synthesized BaF2 NPs embedded PVDF thin film. Our HPPC is able to generate a photovoltage similar to 1.3 V within 65 s under exposure of visible light (110 mW/cm(2)) with superior energy storage efficiency similar to 79%. The device has the ability of storing charge similar to 1200 F/m(2) with power density 18.7 W/m(2) and charge density 1500 C/m(2). Our light weighted self-charged power bank may be utilized as power supplier in portable electronic appliances.

AB Pyrolysis of plastics has gained more attention recently due to the advantages of environmental protection and energy conversion. In this study, low-density polyethylene (LDPE), polypropylene (PP) and polyvinyl chloride (PVC) were studied under high heating rate conditions to investigate pyrolysis behaviors and find the most suitable kinetic reaction mechanisms. The TG and DTG curves for LDPE were similar to those for PP, but different from those for PVC. It was found that high heating rate led to the shifting of initial, end and peak temperatures to higher values. The FTIR results showed the main products of LDPE and PP were alkanes and alkenes, and the major products of PVC were HCl, alkenes and a small number of aromatic compounds. A comparative study of model-free methods like Ozawa-Flynn-Wall (OFW), Kissinger-Akahira-Sunose (KAS) and Friedman method were discussed to calculate activation energy. Kinetic reaction mechanisms were predicted by using model-fitting methods including Coats-Redfern and Criado method. The pyrolysis reaction mechanism of LDPE was summarized as contracting sphere model, PP was summarized as contracting cylinder model, whereas that of PVC was concluded that two-dimension nucleation for the first stage and three-dimension diffusion (Jander) for the second stage.

DE Friction-induced vibration; Energy harvesting; Piezoelectric;
   Experimental analysis; Numerical analysis
AB In this work, piezoelectric energy harvesting via friction-induced vibration is investigated experimentally and numerically. A test setup which is able to generate friction-induced vibration and simultaneously harvest vibration energy is created. The experimental results verify the feasibility of energy harvesting via friction-induced vibration. They suggest that there is a critical driving speed for the friction system to generate strongest friction induced vibration and output highest voltage; a larger normal load is beneficial for producing stronger vibration and outputting higher voltage; the external electric resistance has little effect on the vibration of the friction system, instead it will modify the output voltage amplitude within limits. To further understand the experimental findings, both the complex eigenvalue analysis and implicit dynamic analysis are performed in ABAQUS. The complex eigenvalue analysis further confirms the feasibility of energy harvesting by means of friction induced vibration, and shows that the vibration in both tangential and normal directions can be harvested. The implicit dynamic analysis verifies the effect of driving speed and normal load on the system dynamics and harvested energy. Accordingly, a two-degree-of-freedom friction system model is proposed to qualitatively characterise the effect of external electric resistance on the system dynamics and harvested energy. This investigation offers quite a new way of harvesting vibration energy.

AB A thermoelectric heat recovery unit could actively use thermoelectric refrigeration process to recover waste heat of the air exhausted from buildings. Theoretical analysis of a thermoelectric heat recovery unit is firstly conducted in the present work, and a corresponding mathematical model is proposed to incorporate with the thermoelectric cooling effect and the method of effectiveness-number of transfer units. Subsequently, the cost performance model considering the relationship between system performances and operating cost is set up, aiming to critically evaluate the global performance of thermoelectric heat recovery system. Overall thermal conductance is determined analytically from steady-state model, where the optimal operating parameters, including the quantity, filling factor, length of P-N legs and couple numbers of thermoelectric coolers are identified. Finally, this prediction method is used to analyze system performance and operating cost in a practical thermoelectric heat recovery system operated in a representative residential building area. The simulation results demonstrated that the lower operating cost of a thermoelectric heat recovery system could be lower than 0.02 $/kWh under the optimal parametric conditions. In addition, present demo investigations indicated that the use of multiple thermoelectric cooling units in the heat recovery ventilation system could further reduce operating cost and promote the cooling capacity simultaneously. Present work illuminated that the thermoelectric heat recovery unit has a great potential for being applied in future energy-efficient buildings.

AB Catalytic co-pyrolysis of grape seeds and waste tyres was performed in a fixed-bed reactor using calcined calcite as a catalyst. The organic phase obtained was analysed for its further application as a potential and stable drop-in fuel. Remarkable positive effects were achieved after the joint incorporation of both waste tyres and calcined calcite to grape seeds in the process. More specifically, the addition of considerable amounts of waste tyres (between 20 and 40 wt%) with a constant ratio of feedstock to calcined calcite of 1 were considered the optimal experimental conditions to promote positive synergistic effects on bio-oil yields and its characteristics as a fuel. Thus, when the proportion of waste tyres in the feed reached 40 wt%, the organic phase yield was considerable improved, reaching up values higher than 73 wt%, significantly greater than those obtained from conventional pyrolysis (61 wt%). Moreover, oxygen content was reduced to 4.2 wt%, minimizing any problems related to corrosivity and instability. HHV was enlarged from 15.3 up to 27.3 MJ/kg, significantly increasing the value of the resulting bio-oil. pH values and specially total acid number were also improved reaching values down to 1 mg KOH/g(bio-oil) in all cases. Additionally, a more valuable chemical composition was achieved since the production of aromatic and, cyclic hydrocarbons was maximized, while a significant reduction in phenolic compounds was achieved. Moreover, bio-oil sulphur content was drastically reduced in comparison with the pyrolysis of waste tyres by itself from 0.6 down to 0.2 wt%. The role of calcined calcite was directly related to the promotion of dehydration reactions of acids and phenols in order to generate hydrocarbons. On the other hand, radical interactions between the biomass and waste tyres pyrolysis products played a fundamental role in the production of more valuable compounds. Finally, the CO2 capture effect produced a more environmentally friendly gas while maintaining its calorific value.

AB A Solar Tower Aided Coal-fired Power (STACP) system utilizes a solar tower coupled to a conventional coal-fired power system to reduce pollutants, greenhouse gas emissions and the investment of solar energy facilities. This paper examines three different schemes for integrating solar energy into a conventional boiler. For each scheme, an energy and exergy analysis of a 600 MWe supercritical coal-fired power system is combined with 53 MWth of solar energy in both a fuel saving mode and a power boosting mode. The results show that, for all these integration schemes, the boiler's efficiency and system's efficiency are reduced. However, the standard coal consumption rate is lower in comparison to conventional power plants and the standard coal consumption rate in the fuel saving mode is lower than that in the power boosting mode for all three schemes. Comprehensively considering both the standard coal consumption rate and efficiency, the scheme that uses solar energy to heat superheat steam and subcooled feed-water is the best integration option. Compared with a coal-fired only system, the saved standard coal consumption rate of the above mentioned scheme in fuel saving mode and power boosting mode can reach up to 11.15 g/kWh and 11.11 g/kWh, respectively. Exergy analysis shows, for STACP system, exergy losses of boiler and solar field contribute over 88% of whole system's exergy loss.

AB In this study, the effects of phase change material on a solar chimney were studied both experimentally and numerically. Paraffin wax, as a phase change material, was installed inside the small constructed solar chimney in the campus of the University of Tehran with 1.5 m collector radius, 3 m chimney height and 20 cm chimney diameter. The goal of the paper was to illustrate the application of a properly constructed Artificial Neural Network model to predict the performance of the solar chimney, filled with phase change material. The parameters T-A and T-air were reported as the input and output data, respectively. Then, a multi-layer neural network using MATLAB software was employed to find a relationship between the inputs and outputs. The process had eight inputs and four outputs, and it was shown that the trained network was well-suited for the problem modeling. Comparing the results with the experimental data indicates the accuracy of the analysis. As a result of the research, the correlation between the predicted values by the network and the experiments, for all outputs, was more than 99%. Moreover, the average value of the relative errors for all outputs were less than 3%.

AB Microwave-assisted direct liquefaction of solid digestate was carried out in polyethylene glycol and glycerol employing sulfuric acid as catalyst, in order to convert it into a biofuel. Response Surface Methodology (RSM) coupled with Box-Behnken Design (BBD) with a total of 15 individual experiments was used to optimize the conditions of three independent variables (temperature, reaction time and solvent-to-biomass ratio) related to the bio-oil yield, the higher heating value (HHV) of bio-oil and the energy use of microwave treatment. Desirability function was employed to determine the optimal reaction conditions of the liquefaction process. The results showed that at the optimal conditions the bio-oil yield, the HHV of bio-oil and energy use were respectively 59.38%, 28.48 MJ/kg, and 115.93 Wh. The predicted responses showed a good compliance to the obtained experimental data. The optimized bio-oil was further characterized using FTIR analysis while the properties of the solid digestate and the liquefaction residue were analyzed by means of SEM analysis.

AB Nowadays, there is a great shortage of non-renewable energy, and the environmental problems such as air pollution caused by automobile exhaust are very serious. The traditional fuel vehicle has been unable to meet the current human needs, so more and more people are concerned about the development of the hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs). Based on proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) is a new clean energy without pollution, PEMFC-HEV has a great potential for development. In this review, we have made a comprehensive research on energy management strategy (EMS) of the hybrid power system (HPS) for PEMFC-HEV in recent years. This paper focuses on the EMS of PEMFC as the main power source, the battery and the supercapacitor (SC) as the auxiliary energy in HEV. In this research, the classification of PEMFC-HEV is introduced in detail, and the advantages and disadvantages of various combinations of HPS are summarized. In addition, according to the different requirements and optimization targets of PEMFC-HEV, this paper makes a deep study of the current PEMFC-HEV hybrid system model, and the EMS developed by the researchers. Besides, the simulation and experimental results are compared with each other. From the perspective of strict evaluation, the existing technology can perform more or less. However, high efficiency and optimization performance still fail to achieve high goals. Therefore, the current problems and main control strategies of PEMFC-HEV are discussed and summarized, which is helpful for the development of PEMFC-HEV research in the future. The review will be expected to bring more efforts to the future development of PEMFC-HEV, including faster dynamic response, longer service lifetime, economic optimization, and high efficiency for the PEMFC system.

AB Printed circuit heat exchangers (PCHEs) are employed to improve the compactness of a thermoelectric generator (TEG). PCHEs allows miniaturization of the heat exchanger without excessive additional cost, and permit high temperature and pressure (up to 1100 K and 600 bar) of working fluid, which enable high thermoelectric conversion efficiency. To investigate the pressure loss and thermal resistance of a PCHE in detail, three-dimensional computational fluid dynamic (CFD) analysis is conducted. Experimental results of the proposed TEG with PCHEs are newly presented. The TEG provides power density of 233.1 kW/m(3) at inlet temperatures of 448.15 K (hot side) and 293.15 K (cold side), which is the highest value in literature for a low-temperature TEG (< 505.15 K hot side). Based on the models of friction and heat transfer in a PCHE validated by the experiment, it is noted that the flow rate required for the heat exchangers in a TEG producing a given amount of electrical power can be reduced by adaption of PCHEs. Such novel results on the TEG with PCHEs might be helpful for more compact design and expands the applicability of TEGs for waste heat recovery.

AB Calcined dolomite, composed of calcium oxide (CaO) and magnesium oxide (MgO), is a potential solid base catalyst for the transesterification of triglycerides with methanol to produce biodiesel. However, the catalytic role of MgO in the calcined dolomite is not well understood. We studied the effect of calcination conditions on the formation of the metal oxide phases and the catalytic activity of the resulting dolomite-derived mixed metal compounds. Natural calcite with an analogous trigonal-rhombohedral crystal was used for comparison. The surface basicity of the calcined materials was dependent on the type and cluster size of the oxides, which were controlled by varying calcination temperature and heating rate, while their catalytic activity was principally determined by the bulk CaO content. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy indicated the growth of MgO on the calcined dolomite, which possessed an oxygen-deficient surface. The generated MgO exhibited a low basicity, low reactivity with methanol and glycerol in phase transformation, and low transesterification catalytic activity under the studied conditions. The oxide materials obtained from the calcite and dolomite calcined at 800 degrees C exhibited the highest basicity and catalytic activity, giving the FAME yield of > 99 wt% under the studied conditions. The CaO nanocrystallites obtained from the dolomite were highly accessible and more reactive than those derived from calcite in the methoxide formation. An in situ formation of calcium hydroxide (Ca(OH)(2)) was observed for the oxide materials directly reacted with methanol or glycerol and those spent in the transesterification. The small crystallites of dolomite-derived mixed oxides maintained the structural stability of Ca(OH)(2) as an active phase, resulting in a lower formation of bulk glyceroxides.

AB Recently, small scale H-Darrieus vertical axis wind turbines (VAWTs) have got great attention of researchers and wind turbine manufacturers due to their application at roof-tops of residential buildings. They are generally preferred over horizontal axis wind turbines (HAWTs) in terms of lower levels of noise production, operation at low wind speeds and lower manufacturing costs. But the main problem with such wind turbines is their low efficiency, which is mainly due to the complex flow around the turbine blades. It is of great importance to first fully understand the nature of complex aerodynamics associated with such wind turbines. Present study analyzes the instantaneous tangential velocity (ITV) and its impact on the power performance of H-Darrieus wind turbine at five different tip speed ratios (TSRs) i.e. 1-5. Computational models based on large eddy simulations (LES) have been developed using commercial software SC/Tetra V12. Throughout the numerical simulation, it is found that ITV of single blade has a negative value (reverse rotation) for TSRs 1-3 when the azimuth position ranges from 80 degrees to 140 degrees whereas it has positive values during the remainder of the rotation for the mentioned TSRs. Furthermore, the magnitude of the negative ITV for a single blade was found to increase from TSR 1 to 3; the maximum value of the negative peak is equal to approximately -17.2 m/s while at the azimuth position of 110 degrees for blade number 1 at TSR 3. On the other hand, no negative value of ITV is found for any of the three blades during a complete rotation at relatively higher values of TSRs i.e. 4 and 5. The possible physical reasons behind this behavior have been explained through aerodynamic forces and 2D color contours of important parameters, such as vorticity and static pressure. Finally, a discussion has been included in the final section of this paper explaining how negative ITV affects the power performance of H-Darrieus wind turbines. The current CFD model has been compared and validated with experimental data.

AB A footwear harvester needs to fulfill both technical and practical functionalities, including but not limited to energy extracting and storage, easy implantation and durability. The very limited space in a shoe is the key challenge to the design of a footwear harvester. This paper presents the design, optimization, modeling and testing of an embedded piezoelectric footwear harvester for energy scavenging from human walking. A force amplification frame is designed and optimized to transmit and amplify the vertical heel-strike force to the inner piezoelectric stack deployed in the horizontal direction. Two heel-shaped aluminum plates are employed to gather and transfer the dynamic force over the heel to the sandwiched force amplification frames. The dynamic force at the heel is measured to design, optimize and simulate the piezoelectric footwear harvester. A numerical model is developed and validated to be capable of precisely predicting the electrical outputs of the harvester. Two prototypes, respectively including eight and six stacks, are fabricated and tested on a treadmill at different walking speeds and external resistances. The numerical simulations agree well with experiments. The harvester with fewer piezoelectric stacks could produce more power at the same walking speed and matched resistance. Experimental results manifest that the footwear harvesters with eight and six stacks, respectively, have 7 mW/shoe and 9 mW/shoe average power outputs at the walking speeds of 3.0 mph (4.8 km/h). Simulation results from the validated numerical model show that the harvester with four piezoelectric stacks could harvest 14 mW/shoe and 20 mW/shoe average power at 3.0 mph (4.8 km/h) and 3.5 mph (5.6 km/h), respectively.

AB The Stirling engines are being carried out worldwide, used for divers' application such as solar generator, micro cogeneration and cryogenic uses. The present paper is an over view of Stirling technologies researches. Several possibilities of resolving technical challenges encountered when manufacturing or using Stirling machines will be discussed. The most appropriate models and optimizations strategies are reported. Stirling engine performances are derived as function of geometric parameters (swept volumes, dead volumes, heat exchange areas, compression ratio...) for several working conditions (speed, mean pressure, temperature difference and working fluid). The effect of each parameter on the Stirling performances when using numerical and/or experimental approaches are presented. It is concluded that multi-objective optimizations methods are useful for predicting geometric and working parameters that corresponding to the optimal performances of the Stirling engine.

AB Cultivation of microalgae using wastewater has received considerable attention around the globe as a platform to remove inorganic nutrients from the wastewater and producing microalgae biomass for biodiesel production. This can be done by converting freely available nutrients from the wastewater (particularly nitrogen, N and phosphorus, P) into microalgae biomass with concomitant carbon dioxide (CO2) sequestration via photosynthesis process. In fact, microalgae biodiesel could help to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions to the atmosphere through the replacement of fossil diesel as it is made from renewable resources. Despite the various benefits to produce microalgae biodiesel, a number of technical hurdles such as complex processes, requirement of high energy input during cultivation and dewatering (harvesting steps) need to be addressed for commercialization purpose. Besides, additional pre-treatment step is necessary to disrupt the microalgae cell wall to enhance lipid extraction efficiency. Hence, this paper is aims to reveal in-depth analysis and discussions on the process of microalgae-based wastewater treatment as well as microalgae cells disruption technology for lipid extraction. The paper also includes several new directions for technological improvements to improve commercialization potential of microalgae biodiesel.

AB Anode recirculation of proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) is considered as an effective way for self humidification and efficient hydrogen utilization, but nitrogen crossover presents a problem. To investigate the transient characteristics of PEMFC with anode recirculation, a comprehensive quasi-2D non-isothermal transient model is developed. The simulation results show that for a PEMFC initially operated with dry hydrogen, anode recirculation leads to certain level of performance increase in the beginning due to self-humidification effect, and then the performance decreases caused by nitrogen crossover, hydrogen dilution and the increase of anode activation loss. The nitrogen accumulation in anode downstream is severer than upstream, and the performance decline rate decreases with increasing cathode inlet velocity under the simulated operating conditions. The performance and current density distribution uniformity of counter-flow configuration is better than co-flow under low inlet humidity, but the difference becomes smaller with anode recirculation. Anode recirculation and dead-ended anode (DEA) operation both have self-humidification effect, and compared to DEA, the advantages of anode recirculation can be summarized as lower performance decline rate, less chance of local hydrogen starvation and better current density distribution uniformity.

AB Cathode catalyst layer (CCL) design is critically important for improved performance, durability and stability of proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cells. In this study, CCL is designed to consist of two sub-layers with different loadings of short-side chain (SSC) ionomer and platinum (Pt) catalyst for each sub-layer; and such CCLs are manufactured and characterized through morphological, microstructural, physical, and electrochemical characterizations, and the performance of single scaled-up cells containing such CCL designs is measured. The results show that the two-layer design results in a higher porosity and mean pore size, and hence higher air permeability, and provides distinctively higher catalyst activity and Pt utilization for the CCL than the conventional single-layer design under the same overall loadings of the ionomer and Pt for the entire CCL. It is also found that a higher ionomer loading in the first sub-layer (faced to the membrane) is beneficial to cell performance, and the Pt loading in this sub-layer plays a considerably important role as well. Overall, it is demonstrated that with a proper ionomer/Pt-gradient design, it is possible to achieve favorable morphological and microstructural characteristics that lessen ionic resistance while improving mass transport capability, catalyst activity, and Pt utilization, hence overall cell performance.

AB Waste heat recovery is considered to be promising way to reduce fuel consumption of the internal combustion engines. Turbocompounding and water/steam injections are two kinds of methods to recover waste heat from the exhaust. This paper focuses on the impacts of different water/steam injection layouts on the fuel saving potentials of a turbocompound engine. Firstly, the simulation model for an 11-L diesel turbocompound engine is established and validated against experimental data. It is shown that the model obtains high accuracy on predicting the engine BSFC, power, in-cylinder peak pressure, exhaust temperature, etc. Based on the simulation model, the impacts of intake port water injection, in-cylinder water/steam injection and turbocharger turbine (CT) inlet steam injection on the engine BSFC are investigated. The influences of injection parameters including injection mass ratio, temperature and timing on the engine performance are studied in detail. The influence mechanisms of the water/steam injection on the thermodynamic cycle performance are also discussed thoroughly. The results show that merely liquid water injection at intake port or in cylinder cannot obtain fuel reduction. It is mainly due to the fact that water evaporating lowers the in-cylinder temperature, resulting in larger ignition delay and lower in-cylinder pressure. Steam injections in cylinder or at CT inlet can both achieve significant fuel reductions. At engine 1300 rpm condition, the steam injection in cylinder or at CT inlet can reduce the BSFC by 10% and 3.5%, respectively.

AB The objective of this work is to compare and to evaluate the performance parabolic trough solar collector (PTC) and the linear Fresnel solar reflector (LFR) for the climate conditions of Athens, Greece. These collectors are examined under the same operating conditions and they are evaluated energetically, exergetically and financially. The analysis is conducted for all the year. period using twelve typical days, one for every month. Performance curves for the solar systems are taken from the literature in order to estimate the collector performance for different operating temperature levels, solar irradiation level and solar angles. According to the final results, the mean yearly incident angle modifier for the PTC is about 83.73%, while for the LFR is 58.66%, at the examined climate conditions. It has been found that the mean yearly thermal efficiency at 350 degrees C is 52.25% for the PTC and 35.39% for the LFR, while the mean yearly electrical efficiency of the equivalent power production system is 16.11% with the PTC and 10.92% with the LFR. The simple payback period for process heat production was found close to 3-4 years, while for power production close to 8-9 years. Moreover, it is proved that the specific cost of the LFR has to be lower than 185 (sic)/m(2) in order to be a more attractive choice financially compared to the PTC.

AB With the rapid depletion of oil and gas reservoirs, many oil and gas wells become abandoned. These abandoned wells could be recovered if they are drilled in proper geothermal layers. Besides, CO2 is always selected as working fluid due to huge amount of resources, as well as for the purpose of CO2 geological storage. At present, the study on CO2 flow in the horizontal wellbores is quite limited. In this paper, a series of works were done on establishing a model to describe the heat and mass transfer process of CO2 in abandoned horizontal wellbores. The model is solved with numerical method on space. Some meaningful conclusions are listed below: (a). A smaller injection rate is crucial to obtain a higher geothermal production efficiency. Besides, a high injection pressure can exert too much requirement on the equipment; (b). In order to obtain a higher geothermal energy extraction rate, a larger mass flow rate is recommended; (c). a smaller injection temperature is recommended to obtain a higher geothermal energy extraction rate.

AB In favor of renewable energy and using green refrigerant, the absorption air-conditioning system is a good measure for overcoming energy shortage and environmental deterioration. With the thermal method, its performance is not good enough because of much heat loss in the regeneration process. For optimal performance, capacitive deionization (CDI) regeneration method was proposed by regenerating absorbent with electrodes in electric field. Previous research shows the theoretical COP of the CDI based system could attain 3. However, these results lack experimental support. Therefore, this paper presents the experimental research on the actual performance. The influence of concentration and other parameters has been analyzed in the experiments. Based on the experimental results, the energy recovery characteristic also gets confirmed and it provides a new way to improve the performance of the CDI based system. Electricity and energy models have been developed; some important parameters have been investigated. The experimental results present the actual regeneration capacity and corresponding COP. The theoretical results expose the improvement of COP with energy recovery and the influences of equivalent series resistance, flow rate and capacitance. It found the COP has potential to further increase by 2 or even 3 times, could reach 6 with appropriate energy recovery.

AB The performance of an integrated biomass gasification and CO2 capture process to produce H-2-rich gas satisfying a PEMFC specification is investigated. Wood residue and CaO are used as a biomass feedstock and a CO2 sorbent, respectively. Modeling of such an integrated process is performed by using ASPEN Plus. The effect of change in major parameters, i.e., gasifying temperature, carbonation temperature and CaO/C ratio, on the product gas composition is investigated. The H-2 concentration of the product gas leaving the gasifier is found to increase as the gasifying temperature increases and reaches its maximum value when the gasifying temperature is higher than 700 degrees C. For the integrated process, the H-2 concentration significantly decreases as the carbonation temperature increases to higher than 500 degrees C. Moreover, the result indicates that the CaO/C ratio should be maintained at a value higher than 3.17 to ensure that the generated CO2 is completely captured. The energetic and exergetic performances, as well as the environmental impact of the integrated process at various amounts of recycled CO2, are also investigated. The energy conversion efficiency and the exergy efficiency based on H-2 production increase as the CO2/C ratio increases, whereas the CO2 emission shows the opposite trend. The maximum exergy efficiency of 69.65%, based on the hydrogen production and the heat generation, is achieved at CO2/C and CaO/C ratios of 0.6 and 4.48, respectively. At this condition, a specific emission of CO2 of 4.4 g CO2.eq MJ(-1) and an energy conversion efficiency of 88.09% are achieved.

AB The strong growth of intermittent electricity generation from solar PV and wind is leading to a greater need for energy storage at grid scale. In this work a techno-economic model has been constructed to calculate the levelised cost of electricity for two systems that can meet an arbitrary energy demand curve: (1) solar PV and battery storage and (2) solar PV with combustion of bio-crude and bio-gas from biomass. The analysis is performed for conditions prevalent in Queensland, Australia where over a gigawatt of new solar PV capacity is being constructed in 2018. The battery storage assumes lithium-ion batteries and costs derived from the recently constructed Homsdale Power Reserve in South Australia. A variable energy demand curve is assumed in the work. The model shows that the parameters with the most impact on the LCOE for the solar PV and battery system are the solar yield, and total installed costs of the battery and solar PV unit. Assuming, battery costs of 750 AUD/kM/b., solar PV costs of 1.6 AUD/W and a project capacity of 240 MWh/d, the LCOE of the solar PV and battery system was calculated to be 170 AUD/MWh. Using total installed costs forecast for the near future, the LCOE is expected to be in the range 150-185 AUD/W for the variable energy demand curve, and over 200 AUD/MWh if a constant supply of power is required. The parameters with the most impact on the LCOE for the solar PV and bio-crude system are the solar yield and total installed cost of the biomass pyrolysis and bio-crude combustion unit. For a 240 MWh/d project scale with variable energy demand, the LCOE for the solar PV and bio-crude system is estimated to be 116 AUD/MWh. Variations in feedstock cost and project scale showed that the LCOE is in the range of 104-125 AUD/MWh. The main conclusion from this work, is that integration of solar PV and the production and combustion of bio-crude and bio-gas using fast pyrolysis of biomass, leads to competitively priced dispatchable renewable energy that is forecast to be cheaper than using solar PV and batteries for the foreseeable future. It has also been found that the combination of solar PV and bio-crude combustion leads to lower LCOEs than using bioenergy alone, due to the rapidly decreasing costs of large scale solar PV. While the solar PV and bio-crude system analysed in this work will likely be a niche solution, in areas with substantial biomass resources, it offers a credible starting point for the development of larger scale bioenergy value chains, with the longer term goal of converting lignocellulosic biomass materials into renewable transportation fuels and chemicals.
