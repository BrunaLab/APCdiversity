AB The stem cell-based therapy has emerged as a promising therapeutic strategy for treating cardiovascular ischemic diseases (CVIDs), such as myocardial infarction (MI). However, some important functional shortcomings of stem cell transplantation, such as immune rejection, tumorigenicity and infusional toxicity, have overshadowed stem cell therapy in the setting of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). Accumulating evidence suggests that the therapeutic effects of transplanted stem cells are predominately mediated by secreting paracrine factors, importantly, microRNAs (miRs) present in the secreted exosomes. Therefore, novel cell-free therapy based on the stem cell-secreted exosomal miRs can be considered as a safe and effective alternative tool to stem cell therapy for the treatment of CVDs. Stem cell-derived miRs have recently been found to transfer, via exosomes, from a transplanted stem cell into a recipient cardiac cell, where they regulate various cellular process, such as proliferation, apoptosis, stress responses, as well as differentiation and angiogenesis. The present review aimed to summarize cardioprotective exosomal miRs secreted by transplanted stem cells from various sources, including embryonic stem cells (ESCs), induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), and cardiac stem/progenitor cells, which showed beneficial modulatory effects on the myocardial infracted heart. In summary, stem cell-exosomal miRs, including miR-19a, mirR-21, miR-21-5p, miR-21-a5p, miR-22 miR-24, miR-26a, miR-29, miR-125b-5p, miR-126, miR-201, miR-210, and miR-294, have been shown to have cardioprotective effects by enhancing cardiomyocyte survival and function and attenuating cardiac fibrosis. Additionally, MCS-exosomal miRs, including miR-126, miR-210, miR-21, miR-23a-3p and miR-130a-3p, are found to exert cardioprotective effects through induction of angiogenesis in ischemic heart after MI.

ID OLDER; PREVALENCE; ANXIETY; DISEASE
AB Background and aims: The evidence concerning the association between hearing loss and stroke is limited. We aimed to investigate the association of hearing loss with risk of stroke and its subtypes among the middle-aged and older Chinese population.
   Methods: We included 19,238 participants aged 64.6 years from the Dongfeng-Tongji Cohort in 2013. Hearing loss was classified into normal, mild, moderate, severe or greater levels by the pure tone average at speech frequency and high frequency, respectively. We calculated the odds ratios of hearing loss and stroke by logistic regression models.
   Results: With the increase of hearing loss level, the prevalence risk of stroke has gradually increased. Compared with normal hearing, participants having severe or greater hearing loss had a higher stroke risk of 76% and 39% at speech frequency and at high frequency, respectively. Similarly, individuals with severe or greater hearing loss had an increased risk of ischemic stroke of 69% and 52% at speech frequency and high frequency, respectively; while severe or greater hearing loss was associated with about a 2-fold risk of hemorrhagic stroke than normal hearing only at speech frequency. Stratified analysis suggested that some high cardiovascular risk participants such as male, age >= 65, exposed to occupational noise, smoker and with diabetes, hypertension or hyperlipidemia had higher risk of stroke. Furthermore, severe or greater hearing loss combined with age, diabetes, hypertension and hyperlipidemia had joint effects on stroke.
   Conclusions: The results have suggested a dose-response relationship between hearing loss and stroke risk in middle-aged and older adults.

AB Background and aims: Heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is a genetic disorder characterized by high levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). The magnitude of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk in FH patients is highly variable, and this can result from genetic factors. The aim of our study was to characterize whether polymorphisms in VEGFR2 and OPG genes could influence the expression of ASCVD in FH patients.
   Methods: We studied 318 FH patients from the SAFEHEART registry, without clinical diagnosis of ASCVD. A coronary tomographic angiography (CTA) was performed to determine and evaluate the presence of coronary stenosis and coronary artery calcium, as measured by coronary calcium score (CCS). Genotyping of OPG rs2073618 and VEGFR2 rs2071559 polymorphisms was performed using TaqMan 5'-exonuclease allelic discrimination assays.
   Results: Homozygous GG genotype and G allele of VEGFR2 rs2071559 polymorphism were associated with decreased risk of developing coronary artery stenosis. In the analysis of OPG rs2073618 and VEGFR2 rs2071559 polymorphisms, according to the presence of coronary artery calcium, we found significant differences in both polymorphisms. Homozygous GG genotype and G allele of VEGFR2 rs2071559 polymorphism were associated with decreased risk of accumulation of coronary artery calcium measured by CCS in CTA. Moreover, being a carrier of the GG genotype and G allele of the OPG rs2073618 polymorphism increased the risk of the presence of coronary artery calcium measured by CCS in CTA.
   Conclusions: Polymorphisms in VEGFR2 and OPG genes modify the risk of ASCVD in FH patients.

AB Background and aims: Akebia Saponin D (ASD) is a major bioactive triterpenoid saponin compound isolated from the Chinese herb Dipsacus asper wall (DSW). DSW has been long used as an anti-Alzheimer disease and antiosteoporosis agent in clinics. However, anti-atherosclerotic effects of ASD have not been fully investigated. The objective of this study is to further investigate the anti-atherosclerotic activities and mechanisms of ASD in vivo and in vitro.
   Methods: In in vitro experiments, ASD (50, 100, and 200 mu M) was used to explore the effects of preventing H2O2-induced endothelial cell apoptosis and the possible mechanism involved. In in vivo experiments, ApoE(-/-) mice were fed a high fat diet (HFD) and treated with atorvastatin (10 mg/kg/d), ASD (50, 150, 450 mg/kg/d), or the combination therapy (atorvastatin 10 mg/kg/d and ASD 150 mg/kg/d) for 14 weeks.
   Results: We found that ASD reduced the generation of reactive oxygen species, inhibited mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) impairment, diminished the expression of Bax and Caspase-3, increased Bcl-2 expression, and inhibited apoptosis in endothelial cells. ASD significantly increased the expression of anti-oxidant enzymes (GSH, SOD, and CAT) in both liver and vascular tissue, reduced blood lipid levels (TG, TC, and LDL-C), and decreased lipid deposition in the liver and atherosclerotic lesion size in ApoE(-/-) mice.
   Conclusions: Our study revealed that ASD inhibited atherosclerosis development in ApoE(-/-) mice by inhibiting oxidative stress-induced endothelial cell apoptosis signaling pathway, and suggested that ASD might be a potential therapeutic drug in the prevention of atherosclerosis.

AB Background and aims: Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have proven to be involved in the progression of atherosclerosis and dyslipidemia. In addition, vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) phenotype switching, including VSMCs-derived foam cells formation, plays a key role in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. LncRNA ENST00000602558.1, one of the differentially expressed lncRNAs between coronary artery disease (CAD) patients and healthy controls identified by our previous study, was located to TG and HDL susceptibility loci, but its role and underlying mechanism in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis remain unclear. The present study aims to explore the role and underlying mechanism of ENST00000602558.1 in the regulation of cholesterol efflux from VSMCs.
   Methods: ABCG1 mRNA and protein expression in VSMCs was detected using qRT-PCR and Western blot, respectively. ABCG1-mediated cholesterol efflux to HDL from VSMCs was measured by means of NBD-cholesterol fluorescence intensity. The binding of ENST00000602558.1 to p65 and p65 to ABCG1 promoter region was detected by RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) assay and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay, respectively.
   Results: Overexpression of ENST00000602558.1 downregulated ABCG1 mRNA and protein expression, while knockdown of ENST00000602558.1 upregulated ABCG1 mRNA and protein expression. Consistently, ENST00000602558.1 overexpression decreased ABCG1-mediated cholesterol efflux to HDL from VSMCs by 30.38% (p < 0.001), and knockdown of ENST00000602558.1 increased ABCG1-mediated cholesterol efflux to HDL from VSMCs by 30.41% (p= 0.001). In addition to cholesterol efflux, overexpression of ENST00000602558.1 increased lipid accumulation and TC/TG levels, while knockdown of ENST00000602558.1 decreased lipid accumulation and TC/TG levels in VSMCs. Furthermore, we confirmed that ENST00000602558.1 regulated ABCG1 expression and ABCG1-mediated cholesterol efflux from VSMCs through binding to p65.
   Conclusions: In conclusion, ENST00000602558.1 played an important role in mediating cholesterol efflux to HDL from VSMCs by regulating ABCG1 expression through binding to p65.

AB Background and aims: Target and intensity of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) lowering therapy should be tailored according to the individual global cardiovascular (CV) risk. We aimed at retrospectively evaluating real-life LDL-C goal attainment and predictive factors for predefined LDL-C therapeutic goals both in primary and secondary prevention.
   Methods: We collected data from a large cohort of outpatients aged 40-65 years, followed by general practitioners, cardiologists and diabetologists in Italy. All data were centrally analysed for global CV risk assessment and rates of control of major CV risk factors, including LDL-C. Study population was stratified according to the presence or absence of previous CV events, including coronary artery disease (CAD), peripheral artery disease (PAD) or stroke/TIA. CV risk profile characterization was based on the European SCORE. Predefined therapeutic goals were set according to the European guidelines on dyslipidaemia: LDL-C levels< 70 mg/dl for very high CV risk patients in primary prevention and for those in secondary prevention;< 100 mg/dl LDL-C levels for high CV risk patients in primary prevention. Logistic regression analysis with clinical covariates was used to identify predictive factors for achieving these goals; lipid lowering therapy entered in the analysis as continuous (model 1) or categorical variable (model 2).
   Results: We included 4,142 outpatients (43,7% female, age 58.0 +/- 5.2 years, BMI 28.5 +/- 5.0 kg/m(2)) among whom 2,964 (71.6%) in primary and 1,178 (28.4%) in secondary prevention. In primary prevention, none of the patients at very high CV risk had LDL-C< 70 mg/dl and 8.9% of patients at high CV risk showed LDLC< 100 mg/dl. Only 5.8% of patients in secondary prevention had LDL-C levels< 70 mg/dl, specifically 6.5% of patients with CAD, 2.6% of patients with PAD and 4.7% of patients with CVD (p < 0.001). Beyond diabetes and lipid lowering therapy, high risk SCORE estimation resulted a strong and independent predictor for the lack of achieving all predefined therapeutic targets, including LDL-C< 100 mg/dl [OR: 0.806 (0.751-0.865)); p < 0.001], and LDL-C< 70 mg/dl [OR: 0.712 (0-576-0.880); p= 0.002], in primary prevention.
   Conclusions: Despite high or very high SCORE risk and use of lipid lowering therapies, we observed poor achievement of LDL-C targets in this large cohort of outpatients followed in a setting of real practice in Italy.

   MUTATIONS; MARKER
AB Background and aims: Lysosomal acid lipase deficiency (LALD) leads to the accumulation of cholesteryl esters and/or triglycerides (TG) in lysosomes due to the lack of the enzyme codified by the LIPA gene. The most common symptoms are dyslipidaemia and hypertransaminasemia, together with manifestations common to other lysosomal storage disorders (LSDs), including visceromegalies and elevated plasma biomarkers. Alteration of the lipid-liver profile (LLP) has been widely applied as a criterion for LALD screening, but the usefulness of biomarkers has not yet been explored. Our purpose was to explore the utility of plasma chitotriosidase activity (ChT) and CCL18/PARC concentration in addition to LLP to identify LALD patients in an observational retrospective study of two different sample collections.
   Methods: Biological samples refining: Collection 1 (primary hypercholesterolemia suspected) included unrelated individuals with hyperlipidaemia and without LDLR, APOB and PCSK9 gene mutations (Set 1), and Collection 2 (LSD suspected) included individuals without definitive LSD diagnosis (Set 2). We assessed plasma LLP (total cholesterol and its fractions, TG concentration and transaminases activities), as well as plasma ChT and CCL18/PARC. All subjects with anomalous LLP and/or biomarker levels were LIPA sequenced.
   Results: Twenty-four subjects showed altered LLP and/or biomarkers. We identified two LALD patients (one homozygous and one compound heterozygous) and one carrier of a novel LIPA variant.
   Conclusions: The measurement of plasma ChT and CCL18/PARC combined with LLP will be a useful approach to identifying LALD patients in retrospective LALD patient studies.

AB Background and aims: The advantage of combining molecular and morphological imaging, e.g. positron emission tomography and magnetic resonance imaging (PET/MRI), is reflected in the increased use of these modalities as surrogate endpoints in clinical trials. This study aimed at evaluating plaque inflammation using F-18-fluorodeoxyglucose (F-18-FDG)-PET/MRI, and gene expression in a minipig model of atherosclerosis.
   Methods: Gottingen Minipigs were fed for 60 weeks with fat/fructose/cholesterol-rich diet (FFC), chow (Control) or FFC-diet changed to chow midway (diet normalization group; DNO). In all groups, F-18-FDG-PET/MRI of the abdominal aorta was assessed midway and at study-end. The aorta was analyzed using histology and gene expression.
   Results: At study-end, FFC had significantly higher FDG-uptake compared to Control (target-to-background maximal uptake, TBRMax (95% confidence interval) CITBRMax: 0.092; 7.32) and DNO showed significantly decreased uptake compared to FFC (CITBRMax: -5.94;-0.07). No difference was observed between DNO and Control (CITBRMax: -2.71; 4.11). FFC displayed increased atherosclerosis and gene expression of inflammatory markers, including vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1), cluster of differentiation 68 (CD68), matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9), cathepsin K (CTSK) and secreted phosphoprotein 1 (SPP1) compared to Control and DNO (all, p < 0.05). FDG-uptake correlated with gene expression of inflammatory markers, including CD68, rho(s)= 0.58; MMP9, rho(s)= 0.46; SPP1, rho(s)=0.44 and CTSK, rho(s)=0.49; (p <= 0.01 for all).
   Conclusions: In a model of atherosclerosis, F-18-FDG-PET/MRI technology allows for detection of inflammation in atherosclerotic plaques, consistent with increased inflammatory gene expression. Our findings corroborate clinical data and are important in pre-clinical drug development targeting plaque inflammation.

AB Background and aims: Epidemiological data showing that high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) is inversely associated with cardiovascular disease have led to the idea that cholesterol contained in this lipoprotein may be protective. Against, recent evidence suggests that the athero-protection from HDLs may result from other functions, unrelated to the carried cholesterol. HDL accessory proteins, such as paraoxonase 1 (PON1), have been suggested to endows HDL with antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties and to contribute to the athero-protective function of the lipoprotein. We aimed to evaluate whether extreme fluctuation in HDL-C levels correlates with PON1 activity.
   Methods: Levels of PON1-related arylesterase and lactonase were assessed in subjects with primary hyper-alphalipoproteinemia (HAL, HDL-C> 90th percentile), hypoalphalipoproteinemia (HA, HDL-C< 10th percentile) and controls. Cholesterol efflux capacity (CEC) through several pathways and other metabolic parameters and markers of vascular disease were also determined.
   Results: Despite the marked change in HDL-C and Apoliprotein A1 (APO A1) (p < 0.001 for all comparisons), arylesterase and lactonase were only slightly increased in HAL compared with HA subjects (p < 0.05), but not vs. controls. This change in PON1 activities was no longer significant after adjustment for either HDL-C or APO A1. Both enzymatic activities were positively associated only with aqueous diffusion CEC (r= 0.318, p < 0.05 and r= 0.355, p < 0.05, respectively) and negatively with the presence of plaques (p < 0.05).
   Conclusions: We showed that extreme high/low HDL-C levels are not associated with equal increase/decrease in PON1 activities. This enzyme appears to contribute to the HDL role in reverse cholesterol transport and anti-atherosclerosis processes. Further investigation is required to corroborate our findings.

TI CD39 identifies a microenvironment-specific anti-inflammatory CD8(+)
   T-cell population in atherosclerotic lesions

AB Background and aims: CD8(+) T-cells have been attributed both atherogenic and atheroprotective properties, but analysis of CD8(+) T-cells has mostly been restricted to the circulation and secondary lymphoid organs. The atherosclerotic lesion, however, is a complex microenvironment containing a plethora of inflammatory signals, which may affect CD8(+) T-cell activation. Here, we address how this environment affects the functionality of CD8(+) T-cells.
   Methods and results: We compared the cytokine production of CD8(+) T-cells derived from spleens and enzymatically digested aortas of apoE(-/-) mice with advanced atherosclerosis by flow cytometry. Aortic CD8(+) Tcells produced decreased amounts of IFN-gamma andTNF-alpha compared to their systemic counterparts. The observed dysfunctional phenotype of the lesion-derived CD8(+) T-cells was not associated with classical exhaustion markers, but with increased expression of the ectonucleotidase CD39. Indeed, pharmacological inhibition of CD39 in apoE(-/-) mice partly restored cytokine production by CD8(+) T-cells. Using a bone-marrow transplantation approach, we show that TCR signaling is required to induce CD39 expression on CD8(+) T-cells in atherosclerotic lesions. Importantly, analysis of human endarterectomy samples showed a strong microenvironment specific upregulation of CD39 on CD8(+) T-cells in the plaques of human patients compared to matched blood samples.
   Conclusions: Our results suggest that the continuous TCR signaling in the atherosclerotic environment in the vessel wall induces an immune regulatory CD8(+) T-cell phenotype that is associated with decreased cytokine production through increased CD39 expression in both a murine atherosclerotic model and in atherosclerosis patients. This provides a new understanding of immune regulation by CD8(+) T-cells in atherosclerosis.

AB Background and aims: Previous research has implicated dysregulation of phosphate metabolism and calcium-phosphate solubilization in cardiovascular calcification, but epidemiologic studies evaluating longitudinal associations with valvular or annular calcification by computed tomography (CT), a highly sensitive imaging modality, are lacking. Our primary aim was to investigate the associations of mineral biomarkers with incidence and progression of aortic valve calcification (AVC) and mitral annular calcification (MAC).
   Methods: We evaluated the associations of serum FGF-23 (n=6547 participants), phosphate (n=6547), and fetuin-A (n=2550) measured at baseline in the community-based Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis with AVC and MAC on CT performed at baseline and at a median of 2.4 (1.6, 3.1) years later. We used linear mixed-effects models to account simultaneously for prevalence, incidence and progression of AVC and MAC.
   Results: After adjustment for demographic and clinical characteristics, a significant association was documented for FGF-23 with accelerated annual progression of MAC (2.83 Agatston units (AU), 95% CI=0.49, 5.17 AU, per standard deviation (18.46 pg/mL) of FGF-23), but this was not seen for phosphate or fetuin-A. None of these biomarkers was associated with accelerated annual progression of AVC.
   Conclusions: This study provides evidence relating serum FGF-23 to accelerated annual MAC progression. Whether this mineral regulator is a risk marker or is involved in pathogenesis merits further investigation.

TI Coronary computed tomography angiography and echocardiography in

SO ATHEROSCLEROSIS
LA English
DT Article
DE Homozygous; Familial hypercholesterolemia; Imaging; cCTA;
   Echocardiography
ID ATHEROSCLEROSIS; SEVERITY
AB Background and aims: Homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (hoFH) is a rare genetic disease, hallmarked by a lifelong exposure to very high levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). Untreated, patients can experience a cardiovascular event in the first decade of life. Early detection and monitoring of subclinical atherosclerosis in these patients is therefore extremely important. We set out to assess the diagnostic yield of low-dose coronary computed tomography angiography (cCTA) compared to echocardiography in detecting subclinical atherosclerosis.
   Methods: For this single-center cross-sectional study, we included all pediatric hoFH patients treated with lipoprotein-apheresis (LA) in Amsterdam UMC. We performed both cCTA and echocardiography in all patients as part of routine follow-up.
   Results: Six hoFH patients were included. Median ages at diagnosis, onset of LA and cardiovascular assessment (cCTA and echocardiography) were 2.6, 6.5, 10.8 and 11.1 years, respectively. Echocardiography revealed no signs of atherosclerosis in any of the six patients. In two patients, mild dilatation of the cardiac chambers was detected and two patients showed signs of mitral or aortic insufficiency. On cCTA, however, non-calcified plaques without stenosis were detected in four patients. In two patients calcified coronary plaques were found at the ostia of the right coronary artery or the left main coronary artery. Aortic root calcifications were found in two patients.
   Conclusions: Our findings suggest that in hoFH children, low-dose cCTA is superior to echocardiography for the detection of subclinical coronary and aortic root atherosclerosis and should therefore be considered in the routine cardiovascular monitoring of these high-risk children.

AB Background and aims: Pro-inflammatory diet may be a modifiable risk factor for cardiovascular disease. We examine associations of two inflammatory diet scores with preclinical cardiovascular phenotypes at two life course stages.
   Methods: Participants: 1771 children (49% girls) aged 11-12 years and 1793 parents (87% mothers, mean age 43.7 (standard deviation 5.2) years) in the Child Health CheckPoint Study. Measures: 23 items in the Australian National Secondary Students' Diet and Activity (NaSSDA) survey were used to derive two inflammatory diet scores based on: 1) published evidence of associations with C-reactive protein (literature-derived score), and 2) empirical associations with CheckPoint's inflammatory biomarker (glycoprotein acetyls, GlycA-derived score). Cardiovascular phenotypes assessed vascular structure (carotid intima-media thickness, retinal vessel calibre) and function (pulse wave velocity, blood pressure). Analyses: Linear regression models were conducted, adjusted for age, sex, socioeconomic position and child pubertal status, plus a sensitivity analysis also including BMI (zscore for children).
   Results: In adults, both inflammatory diet scores showed small associations with adverse cardiovascular function and microvascular structure. Per standard deviation higher GlycA-derived diet score, pulse wave velocity was 0.17 m/s faster (95% CI 0.11 to 0.22), mean arterial pressure was 1.85 mmHg (1.34-2.37) higher, and retinal arteriolar calibre was 1.29 mu m narrower (-2.10 to -0.49). Adding BMI to models attenuated associations to-wards null. There was little evidence of associations in children.
   Conclusions: Our findings support cumulative adverse effects of a pro-inflammatory diet on preclinical cardiovascular phenotypes across the life course. Associations evident by mid-life were not present in childhood, when preventive measures should be instituted.

AB Background and aims: Arterial wall viscosity (AWV) is regulated by endothelium-derived NO and epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs) under baseline physiological conditions. Whether these factors regulate AWV during blood flow increase and whether this mechanism is affected in essential hypertensive patients (HT) remain unknown.
   Methods: The evolution of radial artery diameter, wall thickness and arterial pressure in response to an increase in flow induced by hand skin heating were measured in 18 untreated HT and 14 normotensive controls (NT) during local infusion of saline and the respective pharmacological inhibitors of NO-synthase and EETs synthesis by cytochrome P450, L-NMMA and/or fluconazole. AWV was estimated by the ratio of the viscous energy dissipated (W-V) to the elastic energy stored (W-E) obtained from the pressure-diameter relationship. Concomitant changes in operating conditions, which influence the AWV, were taken into account by calculating the midwall stress.
   Results: Baseline W-V and W-E were higher in HT than in NT but W-V/W-E was similar. In saline condition, W-V/W-E increased in HT during heating but not in NT. In the presence of L-NMMA and/or fluconazole, WV/WE increased during heating in NT. In contrast, these inhibitors did not modify the increase in W-V/W-E during heating in HT compared to saline. In all conditions, a larger increase in W-V than W-E was responsible for the increase in W-V/W-E.
   Conclusions: The release of NO and EETs maintains a stable AWV during flow increase and this endothelial adaptive regulation is lost during essential hypertension, which may promote excessive viscous energy dissipation and cardiovascular uncoupling. Restoration of EETs availability with inhibitors of soluble epoxide hydrolase could thus constitute a promising pharmacological approach to restore the endothelial adaptive regulation of AWV.

AB Background and aims: Circulating levels of oxidized lipoprotein oxLDL) correlate with myocardial infarction risk and atherosclerosis severity. Our previous study demonstrates that oxLDL immune complexes oxLDL-ICs) can signal through Fc gamma Rs on bone marrow-derived dendritic cells BMDCs) and enhance their activation and inflammatory cytokine secretion. While global Fc gamma R-/- studies have shown that activating Fc gamma Rs are proatherogenic, the role of the inhibitory Fc gamma RIIb is unclear. We sought to determine the role of DC-specific Fc gamma RIIb in atherosclerosis.
   Methods: Bone marrow chimeras were generated by rescuing lethally irradiated Ldlr(-/-) mice with hematopoietic cells from littermate CD11c-Cre(+) or CD11c-Cre-Fcgr2b(fl/fl) donors. Four weeks following transplant, recipients were placed on a Western diet for eight weeks. Various tissues and organs were analyzed for differences in inflammation.
   Results: Quantitation of atherosclerosis in the proximal aorta demonstrated a 58% increase in female CD11c-Cre(+) Fcgr2b(fl/fl) recipients, but a surprising 44% decrease in male recipients. Hepatic cholesterol and triglycerides were increased in female CD11c-Cre(+) Fcgr2b(fl/fl) recipients. This was associated with an increase in CD36 and MHC Class II expression on hepatic CD11c(+) CD11b(+) DCs in female livers. In contrast, male CD11c-Cre(+) Fcgr2b(fl/fl) recipients had decreased hepatic lipids with a corresponding decrease in CD36 and MHC Class II expression on CD11c(+) cells. Interestingly, both sexes of CD11c-Cre(+) Fcgr2b(fl/fl) recipients had significant decreases in serum cholesterol and TGs with corresponding decreases in liver Fasn transcripts.
   Conclusions: The absence of Fc gamma RIIb expression on CD11c(+) cells results in sex-dependent alteration in liver inflammation influencing atherogenesis and sex-independent modulation of serum cholesterol and TGs.

AB Background and aims: Macrophages play an important role in the development and destabilization of advanced atherosclerotic plaques. Hence, the clinical imaging of macrophage content in advanced plaques could potentially aid in identifying patients most at risk of future clinical events. The lifetime of the autofluorescence emission from atherosclerotic plaques has been correlated with lipids and macrophage accumulation in ex vivo human coronary arteries, suggesting the potential of intravascular endogenous fluorescence or autofluorescence lifetime imaging (FLIM) for macrophage imaging. The aim of this study was to quantify the accuracy of the coronary intima autofluorescence lifetime to detect superficial macrophage accumulation in atherosclerotic plaques.
   Methods: Endogenous FLIM imaging was performed on 80 fresh postmortem coronary segments from 23 subjects. The plaque autofluorescence lifetime at an emission spectral band of 494 +/- 20.5 nm was used as a discriminatory feature to detect superficial macrophage accumulation in atherosclerotic plaques. Detection of superficial macrophage accumulation in the imaged coronary segments based on immunohistochemistry (CD68 staining) evaluation was taken as the gold standard. Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was applied to select an autofluorescence lifetime threshold value to detect superficial macrophages accumulation.
   Results: A threshold of 6 ns in the plaque autofluorescence lifetime at the emission spectral band of 494 +/- 20.5 nm was applied to detect plaque superficial macrophages accumulation, resulting in similar to 91.5% accuracy.
   Conclusions: This study demonstrates the capability of endogenous FLIM imaging to accurately identify superficial macrophages accumulation in human atherosclerotic plaques, a key biomarker of atherosclerotic plaque vulnerability.

AB Background and aims: LDL-C reduction has been associated with a decrease in noncalcified plaque (NCP) by serial quantitative coronary CT angiography (CTA). We evaluated the effect of LDL-C reduction on specific components of noncalcified plaque (NCP).
   Methods: We analyzed 154 patients undergoing serial CTAs (118 men, 60 +/- 10 years, interval 4 +/- 2 years) with baseline LDL-C >= 70 mg/dl. Semi-automated software was used for quantifying plaque components based on CT attenuation in Hounsfield units (HU): 30-75, low attenuation plaque (LAP); 76-130, medium-low attenuation plaque (MLAP); 131-350, medium attenuation plaque (MAP);> 350, calcified plaque (CP). Decrease in LDL-C was defined as a reduction> 10% of baseline LDL-C. Plaque volume changes were compared between patients with (n= 85) and without (n= 69) LDL-C decrease.
   Results: There was interval reduction in total plaque, LAP, MLAP, and MAP volumes in patients with LDL-C decrease vs. patients without LDL-C decrease before and after adjusting for differences between the two groups (all p= 0.001). An increase in CP volume occurred in both groups (p= 0.42).
   Conclusions: Decrease in LDL-C was associated with reduction in all components of NCP measured by quantitative CTA. Change in total NCP volume may be the optimal measurement for assessing changes over time of coronary plaque on CTA.

AB Background and aims: One of the objectives of the ESC-EORP EUROASPIRE V survey is to determine how well European guidelines on the management of dyslipidaemias are implemented in coronary patients.
   Methods: Standardized methods were used by trained technicians to collect information on 7824 patients from 130 centers in 27 countries, from the medical records and at a visit at least 6 months after hospitalization for a coronary event. All lipid measurements were performed in one central laboratory. Patients were divided into three groups: on high-intensity LDL-C-lowering-drug therapy (LLT), on low or moderate-intensity LLT and on no LLT.
   Results: At the time of the visit, almost half of the patients were on a high-intensity LLT. Between hospital discharge and the visit, LLT had been reduced in intensity or interrupted in 20.8% of the patients and had been started or increased in intensity in 11.7%. In those who had interrupted LLT or had reduced the intensity, intolerance to LLT and the advice of their physician were reported as the reason why in 15.8 and 36.8% of the cases, respectively. LDL-C control was better in those on a high-intensity LLT compared to those on low or moderate intensity LLT. LDL-C control was better in men than women and in patients with self-reported diabetes.
   Conclusions: The results of the EUROASPIRE V survey show that most coronary patients have a less than optimal management of LDL-C. More professional strategies are needed, aiming at lifestyle changes and LLT adapted to the need of the individual patient.

AB Background and aims: Cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) inhibitor-mediated induction of HDL-cholesterol has no effect on the protection from cardiovascular disease (CVD). However, the mechanism is still unknown. Data on the effects of this class of drugs on subclasses of HDL are either limited or insufficient. In this study, we investigated the effect of evacetrapib, a CETP inhibitor, on subclasses of HDL in patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease or diabetes.
   Methods: Baseline and 3-month post-treatment samples from atorvastatin 40 mg plus evacetrapib 130 mg (n= 70) and atorvastatin 40 mg plus placebo (n= 30) arms were used for this purpose. Four subclasses of HDL (large HDL, medium HDL, small HDL, and pre beta-1 HDL) were separated according to their size and quantified by densitometry using a recently developed native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) system.
   Results: Relative to placebo, while evacetrapib treatment dramatically increased large HDL and medium HDL subclasses, it significantly reduced small HDL (27%) as well as pre beta-1 HDL (36%) particles. Evacetrapib treatment reduced total LDL, but also resulted in polydisperse LDL with LDL particles larger and smaller than the LDL subclasses of the placebo group.
   Conclusion: Evacetrapib reduced pre beta-1 HDL and small HDL in patients with ASCVD or diabetes on statin. Pre beta-1 HDL and medium HDL are negatively interrelated. The results could give a clue to understand the effect of CETP inhibitors on cardiovascular outcomes.

AB Background and aims: Higher blood levels of the omega-3 fatty acids, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), have been associated with fewer cardiovascular events and lower mortality in prospective studies. Our aim was to determine a target level of EPA and DHA to prevent progression of coronary artery plaque.
   Methods: 218 subjects with stable coronary artery disease on statins were randomized to high-dose EPA and DHA (3.36 g daily) or no omega-3 for 30 months. Coronary plaque volume was measured by coronary computed tomographic angiography. Plasma phospholipid levels of EPA, DHA and total fatty acids were measured by gas chromatography mass spectrometry. The omega-3 fatty acid index was calculated as EPA+ DHA/total fatty acid.
   Results: Mean (SD) age was 62.9 (7.8) years; mean (SD) LDL-C level 78.6 (27.3) mg/dL and median triglyceride level 122 mg/dL. Subjects assigned to EPA and DHA had increased plasma EPA and DHA levels variably from 1.85% to 13.02%. Plasma omega-3 fatty acid index >= 4% prevented progression of fibrous, noncalcified, calcified and total plaque in nondiabetic subjects whereas those in the lowest quartile (< 3.43%) had significant progression of fibrous, calcified and total plaque. No difference was observed in diabetic subjects.
   Conclusions: EPA and DHA added to statins prevented coronary plaque progression in nondiabetic subjects with mean LDL-C< 80 mg/dL, when an omega-3 index >= 4% was achieved. Low omega-3 index< 3.43% identified nondiabetic subjects at risk of coronary plaque progression despite statin therapy. These findings highlight the importance of measuring plasma levels of omega-3 fatty acids early and at trial conclusion. Targeting an omega3 index >= 4% maximizes cardiovascular benefit.

AB Background and aims: The association between homocysteine and prognosis of ischemic stroke remains controversial, and the role of platelet count on the effects of homocysteine in the prognosis of ischemic stroke is still not elucidated.
   Methods: A total of 3229 acute ischemic stroke patients from the China Antihypertensive Trial in Acute Ischemic Stroke (CATIS) with homocysteine and platelet measurements were included in this analysis. They were prospectively followed up for death, recurrent stroke and vascular events within 1 year after acute ischemic stroke.
   Results: There was a significant interaction effect between platelet count and homocysteine level on death (p for interaction < 0.05) within 1 year after ischemic stroke. After multivariate adjustment, high homocysteine level was associated with increased risk of 1-year mortality in patients with low platelet level (hazard ratio, 1.70; 95% confidence interval, 1.01-2.88) but not in those with high platelet level (hazard ratio, 1.08; 95% confidence interval, 0.65-1.75). The addition of homocysteine to a model containing conventional risk factors improved risk prediction of 1-year death (net reclassification index 0.53%, p < 0.001; integrated discrimination improvement 0.07%, p < 0.001).
   Conclusions: High homocysteine may be merely an independent risk factor of death in ischemic stroke patients with low platelet levels. Further prospective studies from other populations and randomized clinical trials are needed to verify our findings and clarify the potential mechanisms.

AB A striking feature of atherosclerosis is its highly non-uniform distribution within the arterial tree. This has been attributed to variation in the haemodynamic wall shear stress (WSS) experienced by endothelial cells, but the WSS characteristics that are important and the mechanisms by which they lead to disease remain subjects of intensive investigation despite decades of research. In vivo evidence suggests that multidirectional WSS is highly atherogenic. This possibility is increasingly being studied by culturing endothelial cells in wells that are swirled on an orbital shaker. The method is simple and cost effective, has high throughput and permits chronic exposure, but interpretation of the results can be difficult because the fluid mechanics are complex; hitherto, their description has largely been restricted to the engineering literature. Here we review the findings of such studies, which indicate that putatively atherogenic flow characteristics occur at the centre of the well whilst atheroprotective ones occur towards the edge, and we describe simple mathematical methods for choosing experimental variables that avoid resonance, wave breaking and uncovering of the cells. We additionally summarise a large number of studies showing that endothelium cultured at the centre of the well expresses more pro-inflammatory and fewer homeostatic genes, has higher permeability, proliferation, apoptosis and senescence, and shows more endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition than endothelium at the edge. This simple method, when correctly interpreted, has the potential to greatly increase our understanding of the homeostatic and pathogenic mechanobiology of endothelial cells and may help identify new therapeutic targets in vascular disease.

TI Nicotine-mediated autophagy of vascular smooth muscle cell accelerates

DT Article

   APOPTOSIS; EXPOSURE; SMOKING; DISEASE; DEATH
AB Background and aims: Cigarette smoking is an established risk factor for atherosclerosis. Nicotine, the major constituent of cigarettes, mediates the phenotype switching of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) and contributes to atherogenesis. Recent studies show that autophagy regulates atherogenesis via several pathways. The aim of this study is to determine whether nicotine regulates autophagy and subsequently mediates the phenotypic transition of VSMCs.
   Methods and results: Oil Red O and HE staining of aortic sections of ApoE(-/)-mice showed that nicotine promoted atherosclerosis, and in situ expression of a-SMA indicated the involvement of VSMCs. Western blotting documented that nicotine induced the aorta autophagy. Cultured VSMCs treated with nicotine resulted in the increase of LC3 II-to-LC3 I ratio and the decrease of P62, along with GFP-LC3 puncta assay and transmission electron microscopy, further reflecting nicotine-induced autophagy. In addition, Western blotting and quantitative real-time PCR showed that VSMCs exposed to nicotine underwent changes in the expression of differentiation markers (a-SMA, SM22a and osteopontin), confirming the role of nicotine in VSMC differentiation. Transwell migration and scratch assays demonstrated that nicotine increased the migratory capacity of VSMCs. Finally, nicotine also increased the levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS), as measured by DCFH-DA staining. After respectively inhibiting autophagy (3-MA), oxidative stress (NAC), NF-.B activity (BAY 11-7082, si-p65) and nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs, hexamethonium), nicotine-induced autophagy and VSMC phenotype switching were reversed.
   Conclusions: Nicotine-induced autophagy promotes the phenotype switching of VSMCs and accelerates atherosclerosis, which is partly mediated by the nAChRs/ROS/NF-.B signaling pathway.

   EXPRESSION; VARIANTS; RISK
AB Background and aims: A recently identified locus for coronary artery disease (CAD) tagged by rs8042271 is in a region of tight linkage disequilibrium (LD) between 2 genes (MFGE8, ABHD2) previously linked to atherosclerosis. Here we have explored the regulatory framework of this region to identify its functional relationship to CAD.
   Methods: The CAD Associated Region between MFGE8 and ABHD2 (CARMA) was investigated by bioinformatic approaches and transcriptional reporter assays to prioritize target genes and identify putative causal variants. Findings were integrated with publicly available gene expression datasets. MFGE8 silencing was performed in cell models relevant to CAD.
   Results: The regulatory potential of CARMA is disseminated sparsely over the entire region. CARMA contains multiple eQTL that regulate MFGE8 in coronary artery and coronary artery smooth muscle cell (CoSMC). SNPs that predict the expression of MFGE8 in artery are concordantly associated with higher risk of CAD (pval=0.0014). Targeting CARMA by CRISPR/Cas9 in a cellular model increased MFGE8 expression. MFGE8 silencing was found to reduce CoSMC and monocyte (THP-1) but not endothelial cell proliferation.
   Conclusions: These findings support a mechanistic link between a GWAS identified CAD risk locus and atherosclerosis. The intergenic locus CARMA regulates MFGE8 in a haplotype dependent manner. Individuals genetically susceptible to increased MFGE8 expression exhibit greater CAD risk. Suppressing MFGE8 expression reduced SMC and THP-1 proliferation. These data support an atherogenic contribution of CARMA/MFGE8 that may be linked to cell proliferation and/or improved survival of CAD relevant cell types.

AB Background and aims: The development of serum markers specific for coronary lesions is important to prevent coronary events. However, analyses of serum markers in humans are affected by environmental factors and nontarget diseases. Using an appropriate model animal can reduce these effects. To identify specific markers for coronary atherosclerosis, we comprehensively analyzed the serum of WHHLMI rabbits, which spontaneously develop coronary atherosclerosis.
   Methods: Female WHHLMI rabbits were fed standard chow. Serum and plasma were collected under fasting at intervals of 4 months from 4 months old, and a total of 313 lipid molecules, 59 metabolites, lipoprotein lipid levels, and various plasma biochemical parameters were analyzed. The severity of coronary lesions was evaluated with cross-sectional narrowing (CSN) corrected with a frequency of 75%-89% CSN and CSN> 90%.
   Results: There was a large variation in the severity of coronary lesions in WHHLMI rabbits despite almost no differences in plasma biochemical parameters and aortic lesion area between rabbits with severe and mild coronary lesions. The metabolites and lipid molecules selected as serum markers for coronary atherosclerosis were lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) 22: 4 and diacylglycerol 18: 0-18: 0 at 4 months old, LPC 20: 4 (sn-2), ceramide d18: 1-18: 2, citric acid plus isocitric acid, and pyroglutamic acid at 8 months old, and phosphatidylethanolamine plasminogen 16: 1p-22: 2 at 16 months old.
   Conclusions: These serum markers were coronary lesion-specific markers independent of cholesterol levels and aortic lesions and may be useful to detect patients who develop cardiovascular disease.

AB Background and aims: There remains a substantial residual risk of ischaemic heart disease (IHD) despite optimal low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDLC) reduction. Part of this risk may be attributable to remnant cholesterol, which is carried in triglyceride-rich lipoproteins. We evaluated the relationship between remnant cholesterol and coronary atherosclerotic plaque burden assessed non-invasively by computed tomography coronary angiography (CTCA) in patients with suspected coronary artery disease (CAD).
   Methods and results: This was a multicentre study of 587 patients who had a CTCA and fasting lipid profile within 3 months. Calculated remnant cholesterol was total cholesterol minus LDLC minus high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDLC). Significant coronary atherosclerotic burden was defined as CT-Leaman score> 5 (CT-LeSc), an established predictor of cardiac events. Mean age was 61 +/- 12 years and mean pretest probability of CAD was 23.2 +/- 19.8%. LDLC levels were < 1.8 mmol/L in 134 patients (23%), of whom 82% were statin-treated. Patients with CT-LeSc> 5 had higher mean remnant cholesterol than those with CT-LeSc <= 5 (0.76 +/- 0.36 mmol/L vs. 0.58 +/- 0.33 mmol/L, p=0.01). On univariable analysis, remnant cholesterol (p=0.01), LDLC (p=0.002) and HDLC (p < 0.001) levels predicted CT-LeSc > 5, whilst triglycerides (p=0.79) had no association with CT-LeSc> 5. On multivariable analysis in the subset of patients with optimal LDLC levels, remnant cholesterol levels remained predictive of CTLeSc> 5 (OR 3.87, 95% confidence interval 1.34-7.55, p=0.004), adjusted for HDLC and traditional risk factors.
   Conclusions: Remnant cholesterol levels are associated with significant coronary atherosclerotic burden as assessed by CTCA, even in patients with optimal LDLC levels. Future studies examining whether lowering of remnant cholesterol can reduce residual IHD risk are warranted.

AB Background and aims: Limited data is available on the benefit of statin for primary prevention in the elderly. The aim of this study is to investigate whether statin for primary prevention is effective in lowering the cardiovascular risk and all-cause death in individuals aged> 75 years.
   Methods: This was a retrospective, propensity score-matched study and data were acquired between 2005 and 2016 in a tertiary university hospital. Of the 6414 patients screened, 1559 statin-naive patients without a history of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease before the index visit were included. After propensity score matching, 1278 patients (639 statin users, 639 statin non-users) were finally analyzed. Primary outcome variables included major adverse cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events (MACCE) and all-cause death. MACCE included cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, coronary revascularization, and nonfatal stroke or transient ischemic attack.
   Results: At a median follow-up of 5.2 years, statin users had lower rates of MACCE (2.15 vs. 1.25 events/100 personyears; hazard ratio, 0.59; p=0.005) and all-cause death (1.19 vs. 0.65 events/100 person-years; hazard ratio, 0.56; p=0.02), as well as lower levels of low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol than did non-users. The Kaplan-Meier curves revealed lower event rates in statin users (hazard ratio: 0.59 for MACCE and 0.56 for all-cause death). The incidence of myocardial infarction and coronary revascularization were lower in statin users.
   Conclusions: Statin therapy for primary prevention was clearly associated with lower risk of cardiovascular events and all-cause death in individuals aged> 75 years. These results support more active statin use in this population.

AB Background and aims: The ankle-brachial index (ABI) is a marker of atherosclerosis and a diagnostic criterion for peripheral arterial disease (PAD). We studied the association between HbA1c and ABI in subjects with and without diabetes.
   Methods: In the Heinz Nixdorf Recall Study, a population-based cohort study in Germany (N=4,814, age 45-75 years), ABI was measured at baseline, at 5-and 10-year follow-up. Subjects with ABI< 0.9, ABI> 1.4 or selfreported PAD at baseline were excluded from analyses. In 3199 participants, we assessed associations between HbA1c and incident PAD (ABI < 0.9) and change in ABI, respectively, using logistic and linear regression models. Subjects without diabetes, with HbA1c< 5.7% were used as reference group.
   Results: Compared to the reference group, 10-year decline in ABI was -0.066 (95% confidence interval: -0.117; -0.016) and -0.021 (-0.063; 0.021) in subjects with poorly (>= 7.0% HbA1c) and well (< 7.0% HbA1c) controlled previously known diabetes; -0.010 (-0.054; 0.034) in those with newly detected diabetes diagnosed by HbA1c >= 6.5%, and -0.005 (-0.023; 0.013) in those without diabetes, with HbA1c 5.7-6.4%. For poorly controlled diabetes, odds ratios for low ABI (< 0.9) were 3.5 (1.6-7.9), and 3.1 (1.3-7.0) after 5-and 10-year follow-up, respectively. The incidence of Monckeberg disease (ABI > 1.4) was low (6/288 (2.4%) over 5 years).
   Conclusions: Decline in ABI was stronger in poorly than well-controlled diabetes. Subjects with newly detected diabetes diagnosed by the new HbA1c criterion (>= 6.5%) did not show an increased decline in ABI over 10 years.

AB Background and aims: We aimed to evaluate the link between inflammatory score [consisting of C-reactive protein ICRP) and white blood cells], serum uric acid ISUA) and atherogenic index of plasma IAIP) and the cardiovascular health ICVH) score.
   Methods: We used the cross-sectional National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey database. Statistical analyses accounted for the survey design and sample weights.
   Results: Overall, there were 23,004 participants Imean age=47.2 years, 46.5% males). Participants with an ideal CVH level had the highest ratio of poverty to income I3.62%, p < 0.001), as well as lower levels of CRP, SUA and AIP Ip < 0.001 for all comparisons). In adjusted linear regression, a significant negative association was observed between inflammatory score I beta=-0.052, p < 0.001), SUA I beta=-0.041, p < 0.001) and AIP I beta=-0.039, p < 0.001) and CVH score, i. e. participants with a better Igreater) CVH score had a lower inflammatory score. Results from adjusted logistic regression showed reduction in the likelihood of " high-risk atherosclerosis" Idefined as AIP =0.21) [intermediate: odds ratio IOR)=0.90, 95% confidence interval ICI): 0.85-0.95, ideal: OR=0.81, 95% CI: 0.74-0.88] and " high CVD risk" Idefined as CRP =3 mg/ l) [intermediate: OR=0.86, 95% CI: 0.73-0.98, ideal: OR=0.82, 95% CI: 0.69-0.95] across the categories of CVH.
   Conclusions: Our findings highlight that CVH metrics were associated with inflammatory score, SUA and AIP. Furthermore, participants with a better CVH score had a lower CVD risk. These results reinforce the importance of implementing healthy behaviours as proposed by the American Heart Association. If confirmed in clinical trials, this knowledge may have implications for CVD prevention and management.

   INFLAMMATION
AB Background and aims: COX-2-selective inhibitors have been associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular complications, and their impact on atherosclerosis ( AS) remains controversial. The proinflammatory COX-2 and 5-LO pathways both play essential roles in AS and related cardiovascular diseases. Previous clinical studies have provided evidence of the ability of COX-2-selective inhibitors to shunt AA metabolism from the COX-2 pathway to the 5-LO pathway. In this study, the effects of celecoxib, a selective COX-2 inhibitor, on AS and the COX-2 and 5-LO pathways were investigated in vivo and in vitro.
   Methods: Male ApoE(-/-) mice fed a western-type diet for 18 weeks and cultured mouse RAW264.7 macrophages stimulated with 1 mu g/mL LPS for 24 h were used in this study.
   Results: In ApoE(-/-) mice, intragastric administration of celecoxib ( 80 mg/kg/d) for 18 weeks significantly increased aortic atherosclerotic lesion area but had no effect on hyperlipidemia. In addition, celecoxib significantly lowered TNF-a and PGE2 levels but increased both LTB4 and CysLTs levels in aortic tissues. In LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 macrophages, pretreatment with 8 mu mol/L celecoxib for 1 h significantly lowered the TNF-a, NO, and PGE2 levels but increased the LTB4 and CysLTs levels. Celecoxib also decreased the protein and mRNA expression of COX-2 but increased the expression of 5-LO and LTC4S in both ApoE(-/-) mouse aortic tissues and LPSstimulated RAW264.7 macrophages.
   Conclusion: The COX-2-selective inhibitor celecoxib can aggravate atherogenesis, an effect that may be related to upregulation of LTs via a 5-LO pathway shunt.

AB Background and aims: It is uncertain whether non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is associated with aortic stiffness in a racial/ethnically diverse and admixed society. We addressed whether NAFLD presence and severity were associated with carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (cf-PWV) in individuals free of cardiovascular disease.
   Methods: In 7196 individuals free of cardiovascular disease at the baseline Brazilian longitudinal study of adult health, we classified NAFLD presence and severity (mild, moderate and severe) by ultrasound hepatic attenuation. We measured cf-PWV using a non-invasive validated device (Complior SP, Artech Medicale France). We compared cf-PWV of NAFLD individuals to those without by analysis of covariance adjusted for demographics, life style, waist circumference, and arterial pressure. We also analyzed the cf-PWV trend from no-NAFLD to severe NAFLD.
   Results: In unadjusted analysis, from no-NAFLD to severe NAFLD, there were slightly older individuals, lower frequency of smokers, more prevalent diabetes and hypertension. In adjusted analysis, there was slightly higher cf-PWV (m/s) (95% CI) in NAFLD vs. no-NAFLD, respectively 9.32 (9.22, 9.41) and 9.24 (9.15, 9.33) (p= 0.037). Across NAFLD severity spectrum, adjusted cf-PWV increased from 9.24 (9.15, 9.33) in no-NAFLD to 9.69 (9.46, 9.93) in severe NAFLD (p for trend association= 0.001). In sensitivity analysis, diabetes adjustment nullified the association of binary NAFLD with cf-PWV, but not that of increasingly severe NAFLD.
   Conclusions: In racial/ethnically diverse individuals free of cardiovascular disease, NAFLD is associated with aortic stiffness beyond abdominal obesity. The specific NAFLD impact on CVD worldwide is potentially relevant.

AB Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) describes a spectrum of alcohol-like hepatic histological changes, which occur in the absence of any competing causes of chronic liver disease, notably including significant alcohol consumption. A close and bi-directional relationship links NAFLD with the metabolic syndrome (MetS), and concurrent MetS will hasten the progression to more severe forms of NAFLD, including cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Patients with NAFLD will typically exhibit atherogenic dyslipidemia and increased cardiovascular risk (CVR).
   Statins are among the most widely prescribed lipid-lowering drugs. Their use has historically been hampered, in individuals with liver disease, owing to the fear of hepatotoxicity. However, studies suggest that statins are not only effective in reducing cardiovascular events, but may also exert multiple beneficial effects on the liver.
   CVR in those with NAFLD has extensively been covered by our group and others. This updated clinical narrative review will critically examine the effects of statins on the pathogenesis of NAFLD, including the key elementary pathological lesions of NAFLD, i. e. steatosis, inflammation and fibrosis, and its liver-related complications, i. e. cirrhosis, portal hypertension and HCC.

AB Background and aims: Abetalipoproteinemia (ABL) is a rare recessive monogenic disease due to MTTP (microsomal triglyceride transfer protein) mutations leading to the absence of plasma apoB-containing lipoproteins. Here we characterize a new ABL case with usual clinical phenotype, hypocholesterolemia, hypotriglyceridemia but normal serum apolipoprotein B48 (apoB48) and red blood cell vitamin E concentrations.
   Methods: Histology and MTP activity measurements were performed on intestinal biopsies. Mutations in MTTP were identified by Sanger sequencing, quantitative digital droplet and long-range PCR. Functional consequences of the variants were studied in vitro using a minigene splicing assay, measurement of MTP activity and apoB48 secretion.
   Results: Intestinal steatosis and the absence of measurable lipid transfer activity in intestinal protein extract supported the diagnosis of ABL. A novel MTTP c. 1868G>T variant inherited from the patient's father was identified. This variant gives rise to three mRNA transcripts: one normally spliced, found at a low frequency in intestinal biopsy, carrying the p.(Arg623Leu) missense variant, producing in vitro 65% of normal MTP activity and apoB48 secretion, and two abnormally spliced transcripts resulting in a non-functional MTP protein. Digital droplet PCR and long-range sequencing revealed a previously described c. 1067+1217_1141del allele inherited from the mother, removing exon 10. Thus, the patient is compound heterozygous for two dysfunctional MTTP alleles. The p.(Arg623Leu) variant may maintain residual secretion of apoB48.
   Conclusions: Complex cases of primary dyslipidemia require the use of a cascade of different methodologies to establish the diagnosis in patients with non-classical biological phenotypes and provide better knowledge on the regulation of lipid metabolism.

AB Background and aims: African populations have a favourable lipid profile compared to European populations. However, the extent to which they differ between rural and urban settings in Africa and upon migration to Europe is unknown. We assessed the lipid profiles of Ghanaians living in rural-and urban-Ghana and Ghanaian migrants living in three European countries.
   Methods: We used data from a multi-centre, cross-sectional study among Ghanaian adults residing in rural-and urban-Ghana and London, Amsterdam and Berlin (n=5482). Dyslipidaemias were defined using the 2012 European Guidelines on Cardiovascular Prevention. Comparisons between groups were made using age-standardised prevalence and prevalence ratios (PRs) with adjustments for important covariates.
   Results: In both sexes, the age-standardised prevalence of high total cholesterol (TC) and LDL-cholesterol (LDLC) was lower in rural-than in urban-Ghana and Ghanaian migrants in Europe. Adjusted PRs of high TC and LDLC were higher in urban-Ghana (TC PR=2.15, 95% confidence interval 1.69-2.73) and Ghanaian migrant men (TC PR=2.03 (1.56-2.63)) compared to rural-Ghana, but there was no difference between rural-and Ghanaian migrant women (TC PR=1.01 (0.84-1.22)). High triglycerides levels were as prevalent in rural-Ghana (11.6%) as in urban-Ghana (12.8%), but were less prevalent in Ghanaian migrant women (2.0%). In both sexes, low HDLcholesterol was most prevalent in rural-Ghana (50.1%) and least prevalent in Europe (12.9%).
   Conclusion: The lipid profile varied among ethnically homogeneous African populations living in different geographical locations in Africa and Europe. Additional research is needed to identify factors driving these differential risks to assist prevention efforts.

AB Background and aims: The F11 Receptor (F11R), AKA Junctional Adhesion Molecule-A (JAM-A) (F11R/JAM-A), is an adhesion protein constitutively expressed on the membrane surface of circulating platelets and the luminal surface of inflamed endothelial cells (EC). Platelet adhesion to an inflamed endothelium is one of the early steps of atherosclerotic plaque formation. Our previous studies, conducted with cultured EC in vitro, have demonstrated the expression of F11R/JAM-A on the luminal surface of inflamed EC, platelet adhesion to inflamed EC through F11R/JAM-A interactions, and inhibition of this interaction by the presence of F11R/JAM-A antagonistic peptide (F11Rpeptide 4D). In the present study, we examined in vivo the overall health-benefits and cardiovascular effects of long-term treatment of animals prone to atherosclerosis, ApoE(-/-) mice, with F11R-peptide 4D.
   Methods: Twenty ApoE(-/-) mice were assigned to daily treatment with peptide 4D and compared to their counterparts control untreated mice. Mice were observed for wellness and survival. Plaque size in the aorta and heart was measured using histological analysis. Effects of peptide 4D (or scramble control) on platelet adhesion to inflamed endothelium were measured using intravital microscopy.
   Results: Significant reductions in atherosclerotic plaques number and size, an overall robust health with longer survival were found in the peptide 4D treated group of ApoE(-/-) mice. Intravital microscopic studies conducted in exposed vessels of ApoE(-/-) mice demonstrated significant inhibition by peptide 4D of platelet adhesion to the cytokine-inflamed endothelium.
   Conclusions: Our results demonstrate that peptide 4D significantly reduces atherosclerotic plaque formation in ApoE(-/-) mice and inhibits platelet adhesion to the inflamed arterial endothelium.

AB Background and aims: There are limited data comparing clinical outcomes among new-generation drug-eluting stents (DES) in ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) patients with multivessel coronary artery disease (MVD) who underwent primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with culprit-only or multivessel PCI. We investigated 1-year clinical outcomes between biodegradable-polymer (BP)-coated biolimuseluting stent (BES) and durable-polymer (DP)-coated DES in STEMI patients with MVD who underwent two different reperfusion strategies.
   Methods: A total of 4255 patients were enrolled and divided into two groups, a culprit-only (n=2571, BP[ n=264] or DP-DES [n=2307]) or a multivessel PCI group (n=1684, BP-[n=145] or DP-DES [n=1539]). The primary endpoint was major adverse cardiac events (MACE) defined as all-cause death, recurrent myocardial infarction (re-MI), and total repeat revascularization. The secondary endpoint was the incidence of definite or probable stent thrombosis (ST).
   Results: BP-BES and DP-DES showed a similar 1-year adjusted hazard ratio (HR) for MACE (culprit-only, adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 1.114; p=0.740; multivessel, HR, 0.564; p=0.167) and ST (culprit-only, HR, 1.110, p=0.891; multivessel, HR, 0.375; p=0.402). The adjusted HR for all-cause death, re-MI, and repeat revascularization were similar between the two groups. In the total population, the culprit-only PCI group showed a higher incidence of total repeat revascularization than the multivessel PCI group.
   Conclusions: BP-BES and DP-DES showed comparable safety and efficacy in STEMI patients with MVD who underwent primary PCI with two different reperfusion strategies during a 1-year follow-up period.

TI Z-Ligustilide protects vascular endothelial cells from oxidative stress
   and rescues high fat diet-induced atherosclerosis by activating multiple
   NRF2 downstream genes

AB Background and aims: Oxidative stress-induced endothelial dysfunction is considered to exert a vital role in the development of atherosclerotic coronary heart disease (CHD). NRF2 is a key transcriptional factor against oxidative stress through activation of multiple ARE-mediated genes. Z-Lig is derived from the Ligusticum species with antitumor, anti-inflammation and neuroprotection activities. However, the antioxidant potentials of Z-Lig on endothelial dysfunction and atherosclerosis have not been well elucidated. Therefore, in the present work, we appraise the cytoprotective property and anti-atherosclerosis effect of Z-Lig.
   Methods: Potential NRF2 activators were screened and verified by luciferase reporter gene assay. The protein and mRNA levels of NRF2 and ARE-mediated genes, and GSH/GSSG level in EA. hy926 cells treated with Z-Lig were detected. The cytoprotective property of Z-Lig was assessed in the tert-butyl hydroperoxide (t-BHP)-evoked oxidative stress model. Cell viability and reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels in EA. hy926 cells were determined. An atherosclerosis model induced by HFD was used to determine the anti-atherosclerosis effect of ZLig in HFD-fed Ldlr-deficient mice.
   Results: In vitro, 100 mu M Z-Lig upregulated expressions of NRF2 and ARE-driven genes, promoted accumulation of nuclear NRF2 and unbound NRF2-KEAP1 complex in EA. hy926 cells. Furthermore, Z-Lig alleviated oxidative stress and cell injury caused by t-BHP via stimulation of the NRF2/ARE pathway. In vivo, intervention with 20 mg/kg Z-Lig markedly restrained atherosclerosis progression, including attenuation of HFD-induced atherosclerotic plaque formation, alleviation of lipid peroxidation and increase in antioxidant enzyme activity in aortas of HFD-fed Ldlr (-/-) mice. The chemopreventive effects of Z-Lig might be associated with the activation of NRF2 and ARE-driven genes.
   Conclusions: The present study suggested that Z-Lig is an effective NRF2 activator, which can protect vascular endothelial cells from oxidative stress and rescue HFD-induced atherosclerosis.

TI The intestinal microbiota associated with cardiac valve calcification
   differs from that of coronary artery disease
SO ATHEROSCLEROSIS
LA English
DT Article
DE Gut microbiome; Cardiac valve calcification; Coronary artery disease
ID INTERSTITIAL-CELLS
AB Background and aims: Although most risk factors for cardiac valve calcification (VC) are similar to those for coronary artery disease (CAD), they differ regarding lesions and clinical symptoms. Recently, increasing evidence suggests that intestinal bacteria play essential roles in cardiovascular disease (CVD). It is plausible that the gut microbiota is linked to the occurrence of different CVDs under similar risk factors. Thus, we aimed to explore the gut microbiomes in patients with VC or CAD and determine their underlying connections.
   Methods: We collected samples from 119 subjects and performed 16S rRNA gene sequencing to analyze the gut microbiomes in VC and CAD patients and in control volunteers.
   Results: The gut microbiomes of VC and CAD patients were significantly different in terms of beta-diversity. Bacteria from Veillonella dispar, Bacteroides plebeius and Fusobacterium were enriched in the VC group, while members of Collinsella aerofaciens, Megamonas, Enterococcus, Megasphaera, Dorea and Blautia were decreased. According to the association with dyslipidemia, seven operational taxonomic units (OTUs), including Parabacteroides distasonis, Megamonas, Fusobacterium, Bacteroides sp., Bacteroides plebeius, Lactobacillus and Prevotella copri, were regarded as potential pathogens for CVDs. Additionally, Prevotella copri might be a keystone of CVDs, especially in VC patients, while Collinsella aerofaciens is a possible keystone of CAD, based on the multicorrelations of these bacteria with other OTUs in microbial communities.
   Conclusions: Patients with VC and CAD suffer from different gut microbial dysbiosis. The gut microbiomes are associated with the clinical characteristics in these diseases and might be potential therapeutic targets.

AB Background and aims: Little is known about the role of liver enzymes as predictors of non-liver-related morbidity and mortality. The ideal cardiovascular health (CVH) score proposed by the American Heart Association (AHA) can be used to predict mortality and morbidity. We investigated the association of the CVH score with liver enzymes and the risk of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) among US adults.
   Methods: By using the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey database (cross-sectional), the CVH score was calculated as meeting ideal levels of the following components: 4 behaviors (smoking, body mass index, physical activity and diet adherence) and 3 factors (total cholesterol, blood pressure and fasting glucose).
   Results: Individuals with a higher CVH score ("better CVH") had a more favorable profile of liver biomarkers. Adjusted (for age, gender, race, poverty to income ratio, education, marital status and alcohol intake) linear regression indicated significant and negative associations between liver biomarkers and CVH score: (beta=-0.069, p<0.001) for alanine aminotransferase, (beta=-0.095, p<0.001), aspartate aminotransferase, (beta=-0.067, p<0.001), alkaline phosphatase and (beta=-0.125, p<0.001) and fatty liver index. In the logistic regression, with the same confounders, individuals with a higher CVH score had 12% less likelihood of NAFLD compared with those with a lower score. Furthermore, each CVH metric separately was inversely linked to the risk of NAFLD.
   Conclusions: For the first time among US adults, our findings shed light on the role CVH on liver biomarkers.

AB Background and aims: More potent antithrombotic strategies have significantly reduced the rate of recurrent ischemic events in cardiovascular disease. Ticagrelor, in particular, has significantly improved the outcome in patients with acute coronary syndromes, offering potential benefits also in terms of survival. In addition, more recent data have suggested that the advantages of ticagrelor could be extended also to non-coronary atherothrombotic disease, although with contrasting results, especially for mortality reduction. The aim of the present meta-analysis was to investigate the safety and effectiveness of a newer antiplatelet strategy with ticagrelor as compared to traditional antiplatelet regimens in patients with coronary or non-coronary atherothrombotic disease.
   Methods: Literature and main scientific session abstracts were searched for studies comparing a ticagrelor-based antiplatelet regimen vs. different antiplatelet agents in the secondary prevention of cardiac, cerebral or vascular atherothrombotic events. The primary efficacy endpoint was mortality, primary safety endpoint was the occurrence of major bleedings. Secondary endpoints were myocardial infarction and stroke.
   Results: We included 10 randomized clinical trials, for a total population of 73,121 patients, 54.9% randomized to ticagrelor. At a mean follow-up of 13.4 +/- 12.6 months, a newer antiplatelet strategy based on ticagrelor was associated with a significant reduction in mortality as compared to a traditional therapy (OR [95% CI]=0.92[0.86,0.99], p=0.02; phet=0.14), however, such benefits were more evident in patients with coronary artery disease, while not in non-coronary trials, with a significant interaction between patients' setting and the prognostic impact of ticagrelor (p int=0.03). A similar result was achieved for cardiovascular mortality, recurrent myocardial infarction, while for the risk of stroke, the largest advantages were observed in patients with a previous cerebrovascular accident. Major bleeding events were increased in ticagrelor treated patients (OR [95% CI]=1.11 [1.02, 1.20], p=0.01; phet=0.0003), although not affecting overall mortality, as confirmed by meta-regression analysis.
   Conclusions: Based on the current meta-analysis, a newer antiplatelet strategy based on ticagrelor is associated with a significant reduction in mortality and recurrent cardiovascular events, as compared to a traditional treatment, among patients treated for coronary disease but not among those with non-coronary atherothrombotic disease. However, ticagrelor therapy was associated with a significant increase in major bleeding complications.

ID GENDER-DIFFERENCES; COGNITIVE DECLINE; HEALTH; IMPACT; RISK
AB Background and aims: We aimed to determine whether patients with post-stroke dementia (PSD) have increased mortality risk in Taiwan.
   Methods: We included >= 40-year-old patients who received a stroke diagnosis between 2000 and 2012 from a subset of the National Health Insurance Research Database of Taiwan. These patients were divided into PSD (International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification codes 290, 294.1, and 331.0) and post-stroke non-dementia (PSN) cohorts. Furthermore, we propensity score (PS) matched the PSD and PSN groups. PS was calculated through logistic regression to estimate the probability of stroke status assignment given the baseline variables, namely age, sex, and comorbidity. We calculated the adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for death in the PSD and PSN cohorts after adjustments for age, sex, and comorbidities.
   Results: Overall incidence density rates of death were 148.7 and 106.7 per 1,000 person-years in the PSD and PSN PS-matched cohorts, with the aHR of 1.42 (95% CI=1.34-1.50). Average hospital days increased by 9.03 days and frequency of medical visits increased by 15.8 times per year in the PSD cohort compared with the PSN cohort.
   Conclusions: The subsequent mortality rate in patients with PSD is increased compared with those without PSD. Moreover, the average hospital days and frequency of medical visit are increased in patients with PSD. Our findings provide crucial information for clinicians and the government to improve survival of patients after stroke.

AB Background and aims: Atherosclerosis is characterized by lipid deposition, monocyte infiltration and foam cell formation in the artery wall. Translocator protein (TSPO) is abundantly expressed in lipid rich tissues. Recently, TSPO has been identified as a potential diagnostic tool in cardiovascular disease. The purpose of this study was to determine if the TSPO ligand, 18F-PBR111, can identify early atherosclerotic lesions and if TSPO expression can be used to identify distinct macrophage populations during lesion progression.
   Methods: ApoE(-/-)mice were maintained on a high-fat diet for 3 or 12 weeks. C57BL/6J mice maintained on chow diet served as controls. Mice were administered 18F-PBR111 intravenously and PET/CT imaged. After euthanasia, aortas were isolated, fixed and optically cleared. Cleared aortas were immunostained with DAPI, and fluorescently labelled with antibodies to TSPO, the tissue resident macrophage marker F4/80 and the monocyte-derived macrophage marker CD11b. TSPO expression and the macrophage markers were visualised in fatty streaks and established plaques by light sheet microscopy.
   Results: While tissue resident F4/80 (+) macrophages were evident in the arteries of animals without atherosclerosis, no CD11b (+) macrophages were observed in these animals. In contrast, established plaques had high CD11b and low F4/80 expression. A similar to 3-fold increase in the uptake of 18F-PBR111 was observed in the aortas of atherosclerotic mice relative to controls.
   Conclusions: Imaging of TSPO expression is a new approach for studying atherosclerotic lesion progression and inflammatory cell infiltration. The TSPO ligand, 18FPBR111, is a potential clinical diagnostic tool for the detection and quantification of atherosclerotic lesion progression in humans.

AB Atherothrombotic events such as myocardial infarction and ischemic stroke are a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Understanding the molecular and cellular mechanisms of atherosclerotic plaque destabilization or erosion, and developing new therapeutics to prevent acute cardiovascular events is important for vascular biology research and clinical cardiovascular medicine. However, basic research on plaque destabilization, rupture and erosion is hampered by the lack of appropriate animal models of atherothrombosis. Unprovoked atherothrombosis is very scarce in commonly used mouse models for atherosclerosis, the lowdensity lipoprotein receptor knockout and apolipoprotein E knockout mice. Therefore, specific interventions are required to induce atherothrombosis in these models. Two strategies can be employed to induce atherothrombosis: 1) plaque destabilization and 2) induction of blood hypercoagulability. Although the individual strategies yield atherothrombosis at low incidence, it appears that the combination of both plaque destabilization and an increase in blood coagulability is the most promising strategy to induce atherothrombosis on a larger scale. In this review, we summarize the recent developments on mouse models for the investigation of atherothrombosis.

ID ASSOCIATION; STROKE; CANCER; COMPLEMENT; BLOOD
AB Background and aims: Leukocyte telomere length (TL) and mitochondrial DNA copy number (mtDNA-CN), as hallmarks of cellular aging, may be involved in the development of coronary artery disease (CAD) by modulating oxidative stress. This study aimed to investigate the effects of leukocyte TL and mtDNA-CN alone or in combination on CAD risk and severity in the Chinese population.
   Methods: In this two-stage case-control study with 1511 CAD patients and 1553 controls, leukocyte TL and mtDNA-CN were determined by a quantitative PCR assay. Three oxidative parameters, including leukocyte 8hydroxy- 2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG), plasma malondialdehyde, and plasma reactive oxygen species (ROS), were quantified by ELISA or colorimetric kits in a subset of 129 cases and 129 controls.
   Results: In the combined cohort, each 1-SD decrease in TL and mtDNA-CN was significantly associated with a 1.17-fold and 1.14-fold increased risk of CAD (p < 0.001 for all), respectively, after adjusting for confounders. The aggregated score, which reflected the cumulative dosage of the tertiles of TL and mtDNA-CN, showed inverse dose-response correlations with CAD risk (ptrend < 0.001), and severity, as determined by the severity of clinical presentations (ptrend=0.037), the presence of multi-vessel CAD (ptrend=0.004), and modified Gensini scores (ptrend=0.009). Similar dose-response relations of the aggregated score to leukocyte 8-OHdG and plasma ROS were also identified.
   Conclusions: Our data suggested reductions in both TL and mtDNA-CN as independent risk factors for CAD. The combination of TL and mtDNA-CN might jointly contribute to CAD risk, CAD severity, and oxidative stress.

AB Background and aims: It remains unclear how trans fatty acid (TFA) at low-level intake affect lipid levels and the development of acute coronary syndrome (ACS). The study aimed to investigate how plasma TFA composition differs between male patients with ACS and healthy men.
   Methods: Plasma fatty acid (FA) composition (as determined by gas chromatography) was analyzed in ACS patients on hospital admission and compared to that of age-adjusted healthy men.
   Results: Total FA and TFA levels were similar between ACS and control subjects. Palmitelaidic acid, ruminantderived TFA (R-TFA), levels were lower in ACS patients (0.17 +/- 0.06 vs. 0.20 +/- 0.06 of total FA, in ACS and control, respectively, p<0.01), and were significantly directly associated with HDL cholesterol (HDL-C) (rho=0.269) and n-3 polyunsaturated FA (n-3 PUFA) (rho=0.442). Linoleic trans isomers (total C18: 2 TFA), primary industrially-produced TFA (IP-TFAs), were significantly higher in ACS patients (0.68 +/- 0.17 vs. 0.60 +/- 0.20 of total FA, in ACS and control, respectively). Total trans-C18: 1 isomers were comparable between ACS and control. Differences between ACS and controls in C18: 1 trans varied by specific C18: 1 trans species. Absolute concentrations of trans-C18: 2 isomers were significantly directly associated with LDL-C and non-HDL-C in ACS men. The ACS patients showed significantly lower levels of both n-6 and n-3 PUFA (i. e., eicosapentaenoic, docosahexaenoic and arachidonic acids).
   Conclusions: There were several case-control differences in specific TFA that could potential affect risk for ACS. Japanese ACS patients, especially middle-aged patients, may consume less R-TFA.

AB Background and aims: Current trends have suggested covert atrial fibrillation as a mechanism of cryptogenic stroke. However, etiological heterogeneity regarding the underlying embolic sources remains a critical issue in cryptogenic stroke.
   Methods: CHALLENGE ESUS/CS (Mechanisms of Embolic Stroke Clarified by Transesophageal Echocardiography for Embolic Stroke of Undetermined Source/Cryptogenic Stroke) is a multicenter observational registry of cryptogenic stroke patients admitted to participating hospitals, who underwent transesophageal echocardiography between April 2014 and December 2016. We obtained baseline characteristics, radiological and laboratory data, and echocardiographic findings, especially for embolic sources demonstrated on transesophageal echocardiography, and conducted comparisons according to CHADS2 and CHA2DS2-VASc scores (0-1 vs. >= 2, respectively). This study was registered at http://www. umin. ac. jp/ctr/(UMIN000032957).
   Results: The study comprised 677 patients (age, 68.7 +/- 12.8 years; 455 males; median National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score, 2) with cryptogenic stroke. On multiple logistic regression analysis, large aortic arch plaque >= 4mm (odds ratio [OR], 2.25; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.51-3.36; p < 0.001), with ulcerative or mobile components (OR, 2.37; 95% CI, 1.38-4.06; p >= 0.002), was associated with CHADS2 score >= 2. Large aortic arch plaque >= 4mm (OR, 3.88; 95% CI, 2.07-7.27; p < 0.001) and ulcerative or mobile components (OR, 3.25; 95% CI, 1.44-7.34; p >= 0.005) were linked to CHA2DS2-VASc score >= 2.
   Conclusions: The CHALLENGE ESUS/CS registry is a large TEE registry, and clarifies potential embolic etiologies of cryptogenic stroke using TEE. Large aortic arch plaques were associated with high CHADS(2) and CHA(2)DS(2)-VASc scores, and represented important embolic sources in cryptogenic stroke.

AB Background and aims: Atherosclerosis is the first etiology of coronary artery aneurysm (CAA). It is, however, challenging to inhibit the development of CAA. The aim of the study is to carry out morphometric and hemodynamic analyses in epicardial coronary arteries of patients with CAAs caused by atherosclerosis.
   Methods: Various morphometric parameters were obtained from the reconstructed epicardial coronary arterial trees of 61 patients and multiple hemodynamic parameters were determined from the computed flow fields. A two-step analysis method was proposed to enhance the risk assessment of CAAs, i. e., coronary artery bifurcation is the major risk factor for CAA followed by high aneurysm shape index (L/W, where L and W refer to the aneurysm length and maximum diameter, respectively).
   Results: Patients with CAA covering a bifurcation have the higher occurrence (71% and 55% for L/W= 2 and L/W < 2, respectively) of myocardial ischemia relevant to abnormal hemodynamic parameters in comparison with those with CAA in one vessel (43% and 40% for L/W= 2 and L/W < 2, respectively). Patients with CAA of L/W= 2 covering a bifurcation show the worst hemodynamic environment.
   Conclusions: Morphometric and hemodynamic studies support the two-step analysis method, which provides a clinical rationale for the noninvasive assessment of CAAs.

AB Background and aims: The relationship between plaque regression induced by dyslipidemia therapies and occurrence of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) is controversial. We performed a systematic review and meta-regression of dyslipidemia therapy studies reporting MACE and intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) measures of change in coronary atheroma.
   Methods: Prospective studies of dyslipidemia therapies reporting percent atheroma volume (PAV) measured by IVUS and reporting death, myocardial infarction, stroke, unstable angina or transient ischemic attack (MACE) were included. The association between mean change in PAV and MACE was examined using meta-regression via mixed-effects binomial logistic regression models, unadjusted and adjusted for mean age, baseline PAV, baseline low density lipoprotein-cholesterol and study duration.
   Results: The study included 17 prospective studies published between 2001 and 2018 totaling 6333 patients. Study duration varied from 11 to 104 weeks. Mean change in PAV, across the study arms, ranged from -5.6% to 3.1%. MACE ranged from 0 to 72 events per study arm: 13 study arms (38%) reported no events, 8 (24%) reported 1-2 events and 13 (38%) reported 3 or more events. Meta-regression demonstrated a decline in the odds of MACE associated with reduction in mean PAV: unadjusted odds ratio (OR): 0.78, 95% Confidence Interval (CI): [0.63, 0.96], p= 0.018; adjusted OR: 0.82, 95% CI: [0.70, 0.95], p= 0.011, per 1% decrease in mean PAV.
   Conclusions: A 1% reduction in mean PAV as induced by dyslipidemia therapies was associated with a 20% reduction in the odds of MACE.

TI Circulating endostatin as a risk factor for cardiovascular events in

AB Background and aims: Raised levels of serum endostatin, a biologically active fragment of collagen XVIII, have been observed in patients with ischemic heart disease but association with incident cardiovascular events in patients with stable coronary heart disease is uncertain.
   Methods: The CLARICOR-trial is a randomized, placebo-controlled trial of stable coronary heart disease patients evaluating 14-day treatment with clarithromycin. The primary outcome was a composite of acute myocardial infarction, unstable angina pectoris, cerebrovascular disease or all-cause mortality. In the present sub-study using 10-year follow-up data, we investigated associations between serum endostatin at entry (randomization) and the composite outcome and its components during follow-up. The placebo group was used as discovery sample (1204 events, n=1998) and the clarithromycin-treated group as replication sample (1220 events, n=1979).
   Results: In Cox regression models adjusting for cardiovascular risk factors, glomerular filtration rate, and current pharmacological treatment, higher serum endostatin was associated with an increased risk of the composite outcome in the discovery sample (hazard ratio per standard deviation increase 1.11, 95% CI 1.03-1.19, p=0.004), but slightly weaker and not statistically significant in the replication sample (hazard ratio 1.06, 95% CI 1.00-1.14, p=0.06). In contrast, strong and consistent associations were found between endostatin and cardiovascular and all-cause mortality in all multivariable models and sub-samples. Addition of endostatin to a model with established cardiovascular risk factors provided no substantial improvement of risk prediction (<1%).
   Conclusions: Raised levels of serum endostatin might be associated with cardiovascular events in patients with stable coronary heart disease. The clinical utility of endostatin measurements remains to be established.

AB Background and aims: Autosomal recessive hypercholesterolemia (ARH) is a rare disorder caused by mutations in LDLRAP1, which impairs internalization of hepatic LDL receptor (LDLR). ARH patients respond relatively well to statins or the combination of statins and Ezetimibe, but scarce and variable data on treatment with PCSK9 inhibitors is available. We aimed to identify and characterize the defect in a hypercholesterolemic patient with premature cardiovascular disease and determine the response to lipid-lowering treatment.
   Methods and results: Gene sequencing revealed a homozygous c. 1A > G: p.? variant in LDLRAP1. Primary lymphocytes were isolated from the ARH patient, one control and two LDLR-defective subjects, one LDLR: p. (Cys352Ser) heterozygote and one LDLR: p.(Asn825Lys) homozygote. The patient had undetectable full-length ARH protein by Western blotting, but expressed a lower-than-normal molecular weight peptide. LDLR activity was measured by flow cytometry, which showed that LDL binding and uptake were reduced in lymphocytes from the ARH patient as compared to control lymphocytes, but were slightly higher than in those from the LDLR: p. (Cys352Ser) heterozygote. Despite the analogous internalization defect predicted in ARH and homozygous LDLR: p.(Asn825Lys) lymphocytes, LDL uptake was higher in the former than in the latter. LDL-cholesterol levels were markedly reduced by the successive therapy with Atorvastatin and Atorvastatin plus Ezetimibe, and the addition of Evolocumab biweekly decreased LDL-cholesterol by a further 39%.
   Conclusions: The LDLRAP1: c. 1A > G variant is associated with the appearance of an N-terminal truncated ARH protein and to reduced, although still significant, LDLR activity in lymphocytes. Residual LDLR activity may be relevant for the substantial response of the patient to Evolocumab.

AB Background and aims: Density may indicate some tissue characteristics and help reveal the role of epicardial adipose tissue (EAT) in coronary artery disease (CAD). Therefore, we assessed the association of EAT density with the coronary artery plaque burden in patients presenting with chest pain.
   Methods: This retrospective cohort study comprised 614 patients (mean age 61 +/- 9 years, 61% males) with a high cardiovascular disease risk, who underwent cardiac computed tomography angiography. Density was reflected as attenuation.
   Results: EAT attenuation was significantly associated with EAT volume with a negative Pearson's correlation coefficient and gradually increased across coronary artery calcium (CAC) scores of 0, 1-100, 101-400 and > 400. EAT attenuation was tightly associated with CAD risk factors, including age, sex, BMI, total cholesterol, neutrophil to lymphocyte ratios and CAC score. The association between EAT attenuation and CAC score was strengthened after adjusting for multivariable indices (OR 1.21, 95% CI 1.05-1.40, p=0.01) and further adjusting for EAT volume (OR 1.26 95% CI 1.06-1.51, p<0.01). However, EAT attenuation was associated only with CAD presence (OR 1.32, 95% CI 1.02-1.69, p<0.05), CAC presence (OR 1.28, 95% CI 1.02-1.60, p<0.05), segment involvement score (OR 1.19, 95% CI 1.01-1.40, p<0.05) and segment stenosis score (OR 1.19, 95% CI 1.01-1.40, p<0.05) in the EAT volume-and multivariable-adjusted model. Additionally, EAT attenuation was not associated with significant coronary artery lesions and triple-vessel plaques.
   Conclusions: Higher EAT attenuation is associated with a higher risk of CAD.

AB Background and aims: Gestational diabetes (GDM) and maternal obesity are linked to weight gain in childhood and an increased risk of cardiovascular disease later in life. We assessed the effects of GDM and maternal obesity on arterial function and morphology in relation to body anthropometrics and composition in early childhood.
   Methods: We assessed body size and composition, blood pressure (BP), arterial morphology and stiffness in 201 pairs of obese mothers (pre-pregnancy BMI 30.7 +/- 5.6 kg/m(2), 96 with GDM) and their children at 6.1 years (SD 0.5).
   Results: Child BMI (z-score 0.45 +/- 0.92; p < 0.001) and common carotid intima-media thickness (IMT, z-score 0.15 +/- 0.75, p=0.003) were increased compared with a healthy Finnish reference population. No associations with maternal GDM was found. Carotid IMT and pulse wave velocity were unrelated to child sex, anthropometrics, body composition, BP, as well as maternal anthropometrics and body composition. Carotid stiffness was independently predicted by second trimester fasting glucose. Child lean body mass was the strongest independent predictor for radial (RA), and brachial artery (BA) lumen diameter (LD) and BA IMT (LD: RA: r(2)=0.068, p < 0.001; BA: r(2)=0.108, p < 0.001; IMT: BA: r(2)=0.161, p < 0.001) and carotid LD (r(2)=0.066, p < 0.001).
   Conclusions: Children of obese mothers have increased BMI, blood pressure and carotid IMT suggesting a transgenerational effect of maternal obesity and clustering of cardiovascular risk factors in the population. Arterial dimensions were mainly predicted by child LBM, and not associated with maternal or child adiposity, or GDM. There was a weak association with maternal gestational fasting glucose and increased carotid artery stiffness.

AB Background and aims: The impact on heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HeFH) health led by highintensity lipid-lowering therapy (HILLT) is unknown, and the question remains if there is still an unacceptably high residual risk to justify treatment with new lipid-lowering drugs. \
   Methods: This observational, retrospective, multicenter, national study in Spain, whose information was obtained from a national dyslipemia registry, was designed to establish the current prevalence of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in HeFH and to define the impact of HILLT on CVD in this population. Odds were estimated using several logistic regression models with progressive adjustment.
   Results: 1958 HeFH, mean age 49.3 +/- 14.3 years, were included in the analysis. At inclusion in the registry, 295 patients (15.1%) had suffered CVD and 164 (55.6%) had suffered the first event before the onset lipid-lowering treatment. Exposition to treatment associated more than ten times lower odds for CVD than in subjects naive to treatment (OR 0.085, 95% CI 0.063-0.114, p < 0.001). A first CVD event after a mean treatment period of 9.1 +/- 7.2 years occurred in 131 out of 1615 (8.1%) HeFH subjects, and 115 (87.8%) of them were on HILLT.
   Conclusions: Current prevalence of CVD among HeFH is one third of that reported before the statins era. Early initiation and prolonged lipid-lowering treatment was associated with a reduction in CVD. New cases of CVD, in spite of HILLT, appeared mostly among patients accumulating risk factors and probably they may be considered for further lipid-lowering drugs.

AB Background and aims: Better characterization of Proprotein Convertase Subtilisin/Kexin 9 (PCSK9) profile is currently needed to tailor appropriate lipid-lowering strategies in HIV patients.
   Methods: HIV-infected individuals aged=40 years and naive of statin therapy included in the Swiss HIV cohort study were screened for PCSK9 levels with a routine blood sample collection in 2014 at the Geneva University Hospitals. An exploratory linear regression model was built including clinical (age, sex, ethnicity, cardiovascular risk factors, body mass index, low CD4 defined as =200 cells/mu l, leucocytes, lymphocytes, platelet, antiretroviral therapy), behavioral (tobacco and marijuana smoking, alcohol use and physical activity) and biomarker (CRP, TNF-a, IL-8, Il-10 and MCP-1) to investigate association with continuous PCSK9 levels.
   Results: We studied 239 HIV-infected individuals who met inclusion criteria and available PCSK9 levels with a mean age of 49 years. 35 subjects (14.6%) reported marijuana consumption, of whom 20 (57.1%) reported daily consumption and 15 (6.3%) occasional use. PCSK9 levels were correlated with low-density lipoproteincholesterol (LDL-C). Our exploratory model identified marijuana consumption (p=0.023) and low CD4 values (p=0.020) as significantly associated factors with higher PCSK9 levels. No association was found with Framingham risk score. Patients with marijuana consumption had significantly higher levels of PCSK9 with a dose-response effect (p<0.001); the association persisted after adjustment for the calculated Framingham risk score (p=0.003) and additional adjustment for clinical variables (p=0.027).
   Conclusions: In HIV-infected individuals naive of statin treatment, marijuana consumption and low CD4 values are associated with higher PCSK9 levels independently of clinically relevant confounding factors.

AB Background and aims: Oxidized high-density lipoprotein (oxHDL) is characterized by reduced anti-inflammatory properties compared with HDL. However, the role of oxHDL in the pathogenesis of coronary artery calcification (CAC), a marker of subclinical atherosclerosis, remains unclear. We prospectively investigated the association between the change in oxHDL and progression of CAC in a substudy of a multicenter study.
   Methods: In the principal study, patients with a CAC score of 1-999 were treated with pitavastatin with/without eicosapentaenoic acid. Measurement of CAC with multidetector-row computed tomography and a blood test were performed at baseline and at the 1-year follow-up. In the principal study, the increase in CAC did not differ among treatment groups. In this substudy, patients were divided into two groups: CAC progression (change in Agatston score of> 0) and no CAC progression.
   Results: In total, 140 patients were analyzed. The oxHDL level significantly decreased from 167 (132-246) at baseline to 122 (103-149) after treatment (median [25th-75th percentile], U/ml) (p<0.001). The annual change in CAC was significantly positively associated with changes in oxHDL (r=0.17, p=0.04), triglycerides (r=0.17, p=0.04), and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (r=0.22, p=0.01) but was not associated with changes in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol or HDL-cholesterol. Multiple logistic analysis demonstrated that the decrease in oxHDL per 10 U/ml was independently associated with CAC progression (odds ratio, 0.95; 95% confidence interval, 0.90-0.99; p=0.04).
   Conclusions: The decrease in oxHDL is associated with the attenuation of CAC progression, suggesting that oxHDL is a potential target for atherosclerosis prevention.

TI HDL cholesterol and ASCVD risk stratification: A debate

AB This debate is designed to review the usefulness of the cholesterol mass within high-density lipoproteins (HDL-C) to predict the risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD).
   Pro: There is much current confusion regarding the role of high density lipoproteins (HDLs) in atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). While it is an established fact that the concentration of HDL cholesterol is a robust, independent, inverse predictor of the risk of having an ASCVD event, recent studies have questioned whether HDLs actually protect against ASCVD. But this in no way challenges that fact that the concentration of HDL cholesterol is a powerful tool to be used in risk stratification of ASCVD.
   Con: The measurement of HDL-C in the 1970 heralded a new area of promising and exciting research in cardiovascular disease. The measurement of HDL-C has been part of cardiovascular risk stratification for the past three decades. HDL have pleotropic beneficial effects on the arterial vasculature and promote the removal of excess cholesterol from lipid laden macrophages. These effects are only weakly Arelated with HDL-C levels. While HDL-C is associated with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, the epidemiological relationship falters at the extremes of measurement. Mendelian randomization does not support a link of causality and to date, attempts to raise HDL-C pharmacologically have not yielded the expected outcomes. The time has come to consider abandoning HDL-C for cardiovascular risk prediction and clinical decision making and to double efforts to develop better biomarkers of HDL function.

AB Background and aims: Stroke occurrence while on antiplatelet therapy, i.e., a breakthrough stroke, is often conveniently attributed to antiplatelet resistance. However, undetected paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (AF) may underlie breakthrough strokes. We hypothesized that a breakthrough stroke may be a clinical marker for patients at risk of having AF detected after stroke (AFDAS).
   Methods: Consecutive patients without known AF hospitalized for ischemic stroke between 2000 and 2013 were identified from nationwide claims data. The independent variable of interest was continued use of antiplatelet therapy within 30 days before stroke. The diagnosis of AF and comorbidities were ascertained using validated algorithms. Stroke severity (National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale [NIHSS]) was estimated using a validated claims-based method. Univariable and multivariable Cox regression analyses were used to determine the effect of breakthrough strokes on the occurrence of AFDAS separately in patients with mild and severe stroke (estimated NIHSS <= 10 versus > 10).
   Results: Among 17,076 patients (40% female, mean age 69 years), 3314 (19%) were on antiplatelet therapy before stroke. In patients with mild stroke, prior antiplatelet use was significantly associated with the occurrence of AFDAS (adjusted hazards ratio, 1.26; 95% confidence interval, 1.08-1.48). In contrast, no association existed between prior antiplatelet use and the risk of AFDAS in those with severe stroke.
   Conclusions: Patients with a breakthrough stroke of mild severity while on antiplatelet therapy carried an increased risk of AFDAS compared to those not on antiplatelet therapy. Our findings may help prioritize patients for advanced cardiac monitoring in daily practice.

   IDENTIFICATION; ACCUMULATION
AB Background and aims: Obesity is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, but the mechanisms involved are not completely understood. In obesity, the adipocyte microenvironment is characterised by both hypoxia and inflammation. Therefore, we sought to determine whether extracellular vesicles (EVs) derived from adipocytes in this setting might be involved in mediating cardiovascular disease, specifically by promoting leukocyte attachment to vascular endothelial cells.
   Methods: Mature 3T3-L1 adipocytes were incubated for 24 h under control, TNF-alpha (30 ng/mL), hypoxia (1% O-2), or TNF-alpha+ hypoxia (30 ng/mL, 1% O-2) conditions. EVs were isolated by differential ultracentrifugation and analysed by nanoparticle tracking analysis. Primary human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were treated with EVs for 6 h before being lysed for Western blotting to investigate changes in adhesion molecule production, or for use in leukocyte attachment assays.
   Results: EVs from adipocytes treated with TNF-alpha and TNF-alpha+ hypoxia increased vascular cell adhesion molecule (VCAM-1) production in HUVECs compared to basal level (4.2 +/- 0.6 and 3.8 +/- 0.3-fold increase, respectively (p < 0.05)), an effect that was inhibited by an anti-TNF-alpha neutralising antibody. Production of other adhesion molecules (E-selectin, P-selectin, platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule and VE-Cadherin) was unchanged. Pre-incubating HUVECs with TNF-alpha+ hypoxia EVs significantly increased leukocyte attachment compared to basal level (3.0 +/- 0.4-fold increase (p < 0.05)).
   Conclusions: Inflammatory adipocyte EVs induce VCAM-1 production in vascular endothelial cells, accompanied by enhanced leukocyte attachment. Preventing adipocyte derived EV-induced VCAM-1 upregulation may offer a novel therapeutic target in the prevention of obesity-driven cardiovascular disease.

AB Background and aims: There is inadequate evidence to establish statin treatment for primary prevention in the elderly. This study evaluated whether statins are beneficial for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and all-cause death in adults aged >= 75 years.
   Methods: A nationwide, nested case-control study was conducted in Korea. Individuals who developed CVD, including myocardial infarction (MI), stroke, or death from all causes, were matched to controls based on duration of follow-up, age, and sex at the index date. The statin administration data from both groups were retrospectively collected from the index date to five years before. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for composite and individual outcomes associated with statin treatment were estimated by conditional logistic regression analyses.
   Results: In total, 11,017 cases were matched to 55,085 control subjects. Current use of statins was significantly associated with a reduced risk of composite outcome (adjusted OR [AOR] 0.77; 95% CI 0.71-0.84), compared with non-users. Current use of statin also reduced the risk of stroke (AOR 0.74; 95% CI 0.61-0.89) and of all-cause death (AOR 0.73; 95% CI 0.66-0.81), but not of MI. However, former use of statins had no effect on CVD or all-cause death. There were significant decreasing trends in the incidence of composite outcomes and individual stroke or all-cause death with longer duration of statin treatment.
   Conclusions: Current statin treatment has a beneficial effect as primary prevention for composite outcomes and individual event of stroke or all-cause death in Koreans aged >= 75 years.

   COMPONENTS; PATHWAY; PLASMA; C5B-9; MICE
AB Background and aims: Cholesterol crystal (CC)-induced inflammation is a critical step in the development of atherosclerosis. CCs activate the complement system and induce an inflammatory response resulting in phagocytosis of the CCs, production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and release of cytokines. The cyclodextrin 2hydroxypropyl- ss-cyclodextrin has been found to reduce CC-induced complement activation and induce regression of established atherosclerotic plaques in a mouse model of atherosclerosis, thus inhibition of complement with cyclodextrins is a potential new strategy for treatment of inflammation during atherosclerosis. We hypothesized that other cyclodextrins, like alpha-cyclodextrin, may have related functions.
   Methods: The effect of cyclodextrins on CC-induced complement activation, phagocytosis, and production of ROS from granulocytes and monocytes was investigated by flow cytometry and ELISA.
   Results: We showed that alpha-cyclodextrin strongly inhibited CC-induced complement activation by inhibiting binding of the pattern recognition molecules C1q (via IgM) and ficolin-2. The reduced CC-induced complement activation mediated by alpha-cyclodextrin resulted in reduced phagocytosis and reduced ROS production in monocytes and granulocytes. Alpha-cyclodextrin was the most effective inhibitor of CC-induced complement activation, with the reduction in deposition of complement activation products being significantly different from the reduction induced by 2-hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin. We also found that alpha-cyclodextrin was able to dissolve CCs.
   Conclusions: This study identified a-cyclodextrin as a potential candidate in the search for therapeutics to prevent CC-induced inflammation in atherosclerosis.

AB Background and aims: Our study aimed to investigate the association between high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and all-cause and cause-specific mortality in Korean adults.
   Methods: A total of 365,457 participants aged >= 40 years were selected from the Korean National Health Insurance Service-National Sample Cohort from 2009 to 2015. HDL-C level was categorized into< 1.0, 1.0-1.19, 1.2-1.39, 1.4-1.59, 1.6-1.79 (reference), 1.8-1.99, 2.0-2.19 and >= 2.20 mmol/L. Cox proportional hazard models were used to examine the association between HDL-C level and mortality risk.
   Results: In a median 3.5-year follow-up period, 9,350 participants (2.6%) died. Men with HDL-C level of 1.6-1.79 mmol/L and women with HDL-C level of 1.4-1.59 mmol/L had the lowest age-standardized mortality rates for all-cause death. However, for cardiovascular death, men with HDL-C level >= 2.20 mmol/L and women with HDL-C level of 1.8-1.99 mmol/L showed the lowest mortality rate. After adjusting for multiple covariates, the hazard ratios for all-cause and cancer deaths showed a U-shaped relationship with HDL-C level for both sexes. However, there were heterogenetic associations between HDL-C level and mortality risk of subtypes of cardiovascular disease by sex. For other causes of death except for cardiovascular and cancer death, elevated mortality risk was mainly due to external causes (ICD-10 code, S00-T98).
   Conclusions: In South Korea, very high HDL-C level was associated with increased risk of all-cause death. However, the increased all-cause mortality risk in people with very high HDL-C level was partly due to mortality risk from external causes.

AB Background and aims: Primary hypobetalipoproteinemia is generally considered a heterogenic group of monogenic, inherited lipoprotein disorders characterized by low concentrations of LDL cholesterol and apolipoprotein B in plasma. Lipoprotein disorders include abetalipoproteinemia, familial hypobetalipoproteinemia, chylomicron retention disease, and familial combined hypolipidemia. Our aim was to review and analyze the results of the molecular analysis of hypolipidemic patients studied in our laboratory over the last 15 years.
   Methods: The study included 44 patients with clinical and biochemical data. Genomic studies were performed and genetic variants were characterized by bioinformatics analysis. A weighted LDL cholesterol gene score was calculated to evaluate common variants associated with impaired lipid concentrations and their distribution among patients.
   Results: Twenty-three patients were genetically confirmed as affected by primary hypobetalipoproteinemia. In this group of patients, the most prevalent mutated genes were APOB (in 17 patients, with eight novel mutations identified), SAR1B (in 3 patients, with one novel mutation identified), ANGPTL3 (in 2 patients), and MTTP (in 1 patient). The other 21 patients could not be genetically diagnosed with hypobetalipoproteinemia despite presenting suggestive clinical and biochemical features. In these patients, two APOB genetic variants associated with lower LDL cholesterol were more frequent than in controls. Moreover, the LDL cholesterol gene score, calculated with 11 SNPs, was significantly lower in mutation-negative patients.
   Conclusions: Around half of the patients could be genetically diagnosed. The results suggest that, in at least some of the patients without an identified mutation, primary hypobetalipoproteinemia may have a polygenic origin.

AB Backgound and aims: We aimed at determining the effects of statin use on coronary artery disease (CAD) and stroke risks in patients with asthma-chronic obstructive pulmonary disease overlap syndrome (ACOS).
   Methods: We retrospectively enrolled patients with ACOS treated with (N=916) and without (N=6338) statins. The cumulative incidence of CAD and stroke (ischemic and hemorrhagic) was analyzed through time-dependent Cox proportional regression. After adjustment for sex, age, comorbidities, inhaled corticosteroid steroid (ICS) use, and oral steroid (OS) use, we calculated the adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs) and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for CAD or stroke in the statin users (long-term [>600 days] and short-term [<= 600 days]) compared with the non-users.
   Results: Among the statin users, aHRs (95% CIs) for CAD and stroke were 0.50 (0.41-0.62) and 0.83 (0.63-1.09), respectively; moreover, aHRs were 0.30 (0.09-0.99) and 0.90 (0.68-1.20) for ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke, respectively. aHRs (95% CIs) for CAD and stroke were 0.58 (0.47-0.71) and 0.93 (0.70-1.23), respectively, in the short-term users and 0.23 (0.13-0.41) and 0.42 (0.19-0.89), respectively, in the long-term users.
   Conclusions: CAD risk was lower in all statin users, regardless of the duration of use, whereas ischemic stroke risk was lower only in the long-term statin users. No association was observed between hemorrhagic stroke risk and statin use.

AB Background and aims: Proprotein convertase subtilisin kexin type 9 (PCSK9) is a liver secretory enzyme that controls plasma low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels through modulation of LDL receptor (LDLR). Inhibition of PCSK9 using monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) can efficiently lower plasma LDL-C. However, the relatively short half-life of mAbs necessitates frequent passive immunization, which is costly. These limitations can be circumvented by active immunization. Here, we evaluated the long-term antiPCSK9 antibody generation in BALB/c mice vaccinated with a nanoliposomal PCSK9-specific active vaccine.
   Methods: Negatively charged nanoliposomes were used as a vaccine delivery system and prepared via lipid-film hydration method. We constructed a peptide vaccine termed Immunogenic Fused PCSK9-Tetanus (IFPT) by linking a short PCSK9 peptide (as B cell epitope) to a tetanus peptide (as T cell epitope). The IFPT peptide was conjugated to the surface of nanoliposome carriers using a DSPE-PEG-Maleimide (1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine-N-[maleimide(PEG)-2000]) linker. Nanoliposomal IFPT (L-IFPT) construct was formulated with alum vaccine adjuvant (L-IFPTA(+)). To evaluate induction of antiPCSK9 antibody in vivo, BALB/c mice were subcutaneously inoculated four times in bi-weekly intervals with prepared vaccine formulations, including L-IFPT, L-IFPTA(+), IFPTA(+), IFPT, and empty liposomes as negative control. The long-term efficacy of antiPCSK9 antibodies was evaluated over 48 weeks after prime inoculation. Specificity of generated antiPCSK9 antibodies was assessed using ELISA method. To evaluate immunogenic safety, production of IL-4 and IFN-gamma, and population of CD8(+) and CD4(+) T cells in splenic cells isolated from the vaccinated mice were analyzed.
   Results: The L-IFPTA(+) vaccine was found to elicit the highest IgG antibody response against PCSK9 peptide in the vaccinated mice, when compared with the other vaccine formulations. Antibody titer analyses over 48 weeks post-prime vaccination revealed that the L-IFPTA(+) vaccine was able to stimulate a long-lasting humoral immune response against PCSK9 peptide, and thereby decrease plasma PCSK9. Generated antibodies could specifically target PCSK9 and thereby inhibit PCSK9-LDLR interaction. Analysis of splenic cells showed that the population of anti-inflammatory CD4(+) Th2 cells and production and secretion of IL-4 cytokine were increased in mice vaccinated with the L-IFPTA(+) vaccine, while population of inflammatory CD4(+) Th1 cell and cytotoxic CD8(+) T cells as well as production and secretion of IFN-gamma were not altered.
   Conclusions: The results indicate efficient activity of the tested nanoliposomal construct (L-IFPTA(+)) to induce humoral immune response against PCSK9 in BALB/c mice. L-IFPTA(+) vaccine can induce immunogenic-safe and long-term generation of antiPCSK9 antibodies in BALB/c mice.

AB Background and aims: Intraplaque cholesterol crystal (CC) is recognized as a component of vulnerable plaques. However, the clinical characteristics of patients with CC and the impact of CC on clinical events remain unknown.
   Methods: A total of 340 consecutive patients who underwent optical coherence tomography (OCT) imaging of culprit lesions were included in the study. CC was defined as a thin linear structure with high reflectivity and low signal attenuation on OCT images. The incidence of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) at 1-year was compared between patients with CC (CC group) and those without CC (non-CC group). MACE included cardiac death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, target vessel revascularization (TVR), and non-TVR (NTVR).
   Results: CC was observed in 29% (n=98) of the patients. There was no significant difference in baseline clinical characteristics between the CC and non-CC groups, other than in eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA)/arachidonic acid (AA) ratio (0.39 +/- 0.29 vs. 0.47 +/- 0.33, p=0.047) and hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels (6.51 +/- 0.97 vs. 6.25 +/- 0.87%, p=0.016). The incidence of MACE and NTVR at 1-year was significantly higher in the CC group than in the non-CC group (15.3 vs. 7.9%, P=0.038; 8.1 vs. 2.5%, p=0.017). The presence of CC was significantly associated with a higher rate of 1-year MACE (odds ratio 4.78, confidential interval 2.02-10.10, p < 0.001).
   Conclusions: Patients with CC in the culprit lesion had higher HbA1c and lower EPA/AA than patients without CC. The 1-year clinical outcomes in patients with CC in the culprit lesion were worse than in those without CC.

AB Background and aims: Endothelial injury is well-known as a process that can lead to chronic kidney disease (CKD) and atherosclerosis. Hematopoietic activity is known to be associated inversely with CKD and positively with atherosclerosis. Since bone-derived progenitor cells (CD34-positive cells) contribute to endothelial repair (including the progression of atherosclerosis), understanding the association between CKD and carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT), in relation to circulating CD34-positive cell count, may be an efficient means of clarifying the mechanisms underlying endothelial activity.
   Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional study of 570 elderly Japanese men aged 60-69 years, who underwent a general health check-up. Participants were stratified as per a median circulating CD34-positive cell count (1.01 cells/mu L).
   Results: Independent of the known cardiovascular risk factors, CIMT was found to be positively associated with CKD in the participants with high circulating CD34-positive cell counts but not in participants with low counts. Odds ratios were 1.40 (1.04, 1.89) for participants with high and 1.01 (0.72, 1.43) for participants with low circulating CD34-positive cell counts after adjustment for known cardiovascular risk factors at 95% confidence intervals for CKD with one standard deviation increment of CIMT.
   Conclusions: A positive association between CIMT and CKD was observed among participants with high circulating CD34-positive cell counts but not among participants with low counts. Endothelial repair activity might determine the association between CKD and CIMT.

AB Background and aims: Despite the advantage of arterial expansion for life-threatening vascular pathologies, the occurrence of neointima formation remains a prominent complication, with the underlying mechanisms largely unknown. A disintegrin and metalloprotease 22 (ADAM22) belongs to the family of ADAMs that possesses various biological capacities regulating vascular physiopathology. However, little is known about ADAM22 in vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC)-mediated neointima formation. Here, we aimed to evaluate the potential functional regulation of ADAM22 in neointima formation and to further explore the underlying mechanisms.
   Methods: In our study, platelet-derived growth factor-BB (PDGF-BB)-induced VSMC proliferation was examined using a 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation assay and a cell counting kit-8 (CCK8) assay, while VSMC migration was detected using a modified Boyden chamber method and a scratch-wound assay. The functional role of ADAM22 in neointima formation was evaluated based on a left carotid artery wire injury model in mice at 14 and 28 days.
   Results: ADAM22 was significantly up-regulated in both PDGF-BB-challenged VSMCs and restenotic arteries of mice. When ADAM22 was overexpressed in VSMCs, cell proliferation, migration and phenotypic switching were simultaneously aggravated, whereas the opposite was observed when ADAM22 was knocked down in vitro. In ADAM22 heterozygote mice, wire-injury induced neointima formation was significantly ameliorated compared to wild-type control mice. Mechanistically, significantly up-regulated ERK phosphorylation is closely involved in the regulatory effects of ADAM22 in neointima formation. Interestingly, an ERK inhibitor largely reversed the aggravated VSMCs migration, proliferation and phenotypic switching induced by ADAM22 overexpression.
   Conclusions: Our results indicate that ADAM22 accelerates neointima formation by enhancing VSMC migration, proliferation and phenotypic switching via promoting ERK phosphorylation. Suppressing ADAM22 expression may be an effective strategy for ameliorating neointima formation.

ID COMPUTED TOMOGRAPHIC ANGIOGRAPHY
AB Background and aims: Anabolic androgenic steroids (AAS) have been associated with coronary artery disease (CAD). AAS abuse leads to a remarkable decrease in high-density lipoprotein (HDL) plasma concentration, which could be a key factor in the atherosclerotic process. Moreover, not only the concentration of HDL, but also its functionality, plays a pivotal role in CAD. We tested the functionality of HDL by cholesterol efflux and antioxidant capacity. We also evaluated the prevalence of CAD in AAS users.
   Methods: Twenty strength-trained AAS users (AASU) age 29 +/- 5 yr, 20 age-matched strength-trained AAS nonusers (AASNU), and 10 sedentary controls (SC) were enrolled in this cross-sectional study. Functionality of HDL was evaluated by C-14-cholesterol efflux and the ability of HDL in inhibiting LDL oxidation. Coronary artery was evaluated with coronary computed tomography angiography.
   Results: Cholesterol efflux was lower in AASU compared with AASNU and SC (20 vs. 23 vs. 24%, respectively, p < 0.001). However, the lag time for LDL oxidation was higher in AASU compared with AASNU and SC (41 vs 13 vs 11 min, respectively, p < 0.001). We found at least 2 coronary arteries with plaques in 25% of AASU. None of the AASNU and SC had plaques. The time of AAS use was negatively associated with cholesterol efflux.
   Conclusions: This study indicates that AAS abuse impairs the cholesterol efflux mediated by HDL. Long-term AAS use seems to be correlated with lower cholesterol efflux and early subclinical CAD in this population.

AB Background and aims: Our previous data showed that lymphatic function impairment occurs before the onset of atherosclerosis in mice and is precociously associated with a defect in the propelling capacity of the collecting lymphatic vessels. Concomitantly, we found that lymphatic transport can be restored in mice by systemic injections of a mutant form of VEGF-C (VEGF-C 152s), a growth factor known to increase mesenteric collecting lymphatic vessel pumping through a VEGFR-3-dependent mechanism in rats. In the present study, we aimed to determine whether and how early modulation of collecting lymphatic vessel function could restrain atherosclerosis onset and limit its progression.
   Methods: Before the administration of a pro-atherosclerotic regimen, Ldlr(-/-) ice at 6 weeks of age were injected intraperitoneally with VEGF-C 152s or PBS every other day for 4 weeks, fed on high fat diet (HFD) for an additional 8 weeks to promote plaque progression, and switched back on chow diet for 4 more weeks to stabilize the lesion.
   Results: Early treatment with VEGF-C first improved lymphatic molecular transport in 6-week-old Ldlr(-/-) mice and subsequently limited plaque formation and macrophage accumulation, while improving inflammatory cell migration through the lymphatics in HFD-fed mice. The contraction frequency of the collecting lymphatic vessels was significantly increased following treatment throughout the whole atherosclerotic process and resulted in enhanced plaque stabilization. This early and maintained rescue of the lymphatic dysfunction was associated with an upregulation of VEGFR3 and FOXC2 expression on lymphatic endothelial cells.
   Conclusions: These results suggest that early treatments that specifically target the lymphatic contraction capacity prior to lesion formation might be a novel therapeutic approach for the prevention and treatment of atherosclerosis.

AB Background and aims: Calcification is a hallmark of advanced atherosclerosis and an active process akin to bone remodeling. Heparanase (HPSE) is an endo-beta-glucuronidase, which cleaves glycosaminoglycan chains of heparan sulfate proteoglycans. The role of HPSE is controversial in osteogenesis and bone remodeling while it is unexplored in vascular calcification. Previously, we reported upregulation of HPSE in human carotid endarterectomies from symptomatic patients and showed correlation of HPSE expression with markers of inflammation and increased thrombogenicity. The present aim is to investigate HPSE expression in relation to genes associated with osteogenesis and osteolysis and the effect of elevated HPSE expression on calcification and osteolysis in vitro.
   Methods: Transcriptomic and immunohistochemical analyses were performed using the Biobank of Karolinska Endarterectomies (BiKE). In vitro calcification and osteolysis were analysed in human carotid smooth muscle cells overexpressing HPSE and bone marrow-derived osteoclasts from HPSE-transgenic mice respectively.
   Results: HPSE expression correlated primarily with genes coupled to osteoclast differentiation and function in human carotid atheromas. HPSE was expressed in osteoclast-like cells in atherosclerotic lesions, and HPSE-transgenic bone marrow-derived osteoclasts displayed a higher osteolytic activity compared to wild-type cells. Contrarily, human carotid SMCs with an elevated HPSE expression demonstrated markedly increased mineralization upon osteogenic differentiation.
   Conclusions: We suggest that HPSE may have dual functions in vascular calcification, depending on the stage of the disease and presence of inflammatory cells. While HPSE plausibly enhances mineralization and osteogenic differentiation of vascular smooth muscle cells, it is associated with inflammation-induced osteoclast differentiation and activity in advanced atherosclerotic plaques.

AB Background and aims: Chylomicronemia can be either monogenic or multifactorial. The monogenic form, namely familial chylomicronemia syndrome (FCS), is a rare autosomal recessive disease that strongly predisposes to pancreatitis. However, the clinical variables differentiating FCS from multifactorial chylomicronemia (MCM) are not well established. The aims of the present study were to describe a well-defined cohort of FCS subjects and to investigate the differences between patients with FCS and MCM.
   Methods: A total of 25 FCS and 36 MCM patients were included in the present study. FCS patients were genetically confirmed, whereas MCM patients had negative genetic testing, triglycerides above 10 mmol/L at least once and the presence of both chylomicrons and VLDL in plasma.
   Results: FCS patients presented a significant higher frequency of pancreatitis (60% vs. 6%), multiple pancreatitis (48% vs. 3%) and abdominal pain (63% vs. 19%) and a lower frequency of metabolic abnormalities than in the MCM group (p < 0.0001). In addition, the frequency of cardiovascular events was higher in the MCM group than in the FCS group (17% vs. 0%), although the difference was not statistically significant (p=0.07). In a univariate regression model, the significant predictors of FCS were age at first manifestation (beta=-2.11, p=0.0005), body mass index (BMI) (beta=-1.82, p < 0.001) and gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) (beta=-1.64, p=0.001).
   Conclusions: Our study identified several variables that significantly differentiates FCS from MCM patients. These results need to be replicated in larger cohorts to identify the independent predictors of FCS.

AB Background and aims: We have previously demonstrated that in response to hypoxia, von Willebrand factor (VWF) expression is upregulated in lung and heart endothelial cells both in vitro and in vivo, but not in kidney endothelial cells. The aim of our current study was to determine whether endothelial cells of different organs employ distinct molecular mechanisms to mediate VWF response to hypoxia.
   Methods: We used cultured human primary lung, heart and kidney endothelial cells to determine the activation of endogenous VWF as well as exogenously expressed VWF promoter in response to hypoxia. Chromatin immunoprecipitation and siRNA knockdown analyses were used to determine the roles of VWF promoter associated transacting factors in mediating its hypoxia response. Platelet aggregates formations in vascular beds of mice were used as a marker for potential functional consequences of hypoxia-induced VWF upregulation in vivo.
   Results: Our analyses demonstrated that while Yin Yang 1 (YY1) and specificity protein 1 (Sp1) participate in the hypoxia-induced upregulation of VWF specifically in lung endothelial cells, GATA6 mediates this process specifically in heart endothelial cells. In both cell types, the response to hypoxia involves the decreased association of the NFIB repressor with the VWF promoter, and the increased acetylation of the promoter-associated histone H4. In mice exposed to hypoxia, the upregulation of VWF expression was concomitant with the presence of thrombi in heart and lung, but not kidney vascular beds.
   Conclusions: Heart and lung endothelial cells demonstrated VWF upregulation in response to hypoxia, using distinct mechanisms, while this response was lacking in kidney endothelial cells.

   BINDING
AB Background and aims: Platelets are a major culprit in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Circulating monocyte-platelet aggregates (MPA) represent the crossroads between atherothrombosis and inflammation. However, there is little understanding of the platelets and monocytes that comprise MPA and the prevalence of MPA in different CVD phenotypes. We aimed to establish (1) the reproducibility of MPA over time in circulating blood samples from healthy controls, (2) the effect of aspirin, (3) the relationship between MPA and platelet activity and monocyte subtype, and (4) the association between MPA and CVD phenotype (coronary artery disease, peripheral artery disease [PAD], abdominal aortic aneurysm, and carotid artery stenosis).
   Methods and results: MPA were identified by CD14(+) monocytes positive for CD61(+) platelets in healthy subjects and in patients with CVD. We found that MPA did not significantly differ over time in healthy controls, nor altered by aspirin use. Compared with healthy controls, MPA were significantly higher in CVD (9.4% [8.2, 11.1] vs. 21.8% [11.5, 44.1], p < 0.001) which remained significant after multivariable adjustment (beta = 9.1 [SER = 3.9], p = 0.02). We found PAD to be associated with a higher MPA in circulation (beta = 19.3 [SER = 6.0], p = 0.001), and among PAD subjects, MPA was higher in subjects with critical limb ischemia (34.9% [21.9, 51.15] vs. 21.6% [15.1, 40.6], p = 0.0015), and significance remained following multivariable adjustment (beta = 14.77 (SE = 4.35), p = 0.001).
   Conclusions: Circulating MPA are a robust marker of platelet activity and monocyte inflammation, unaffected by low-dose aspirin, and are significantly elevated in subjects with CVD, particularly those with PAD.

AB Background and aims: Real-world data on treatment patterns in Japanese hyperlipidemia patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) or prior atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases (ASCVD) are lacking.
   Methods: This is a retrospective, longitudinal cohort analysis of administrative claims data (Japan Medical Data Center [JMDC] and Medical Data Vision [MDV] databases) for patients prescribed a new hyperlipidemia medication between 2014 and 2015. Patients were followed for >= 12 months. Outcomes included prescribing patterns, persistence (discontinuations), and adherence (proportion of days covered).
   Results: Data were analyzed for 11,718 and 27,746 DM, and 4101 and 14,356 ASCVD patients from the JMDC and MDV databases, respectively. Among previously-untreated patients, index prescriptions were primarily for moderate statins in the DM (JMDC: 74.7%, MDV: 77.5%) and ASCVD (JMDC: 75.4%, MDV: 78.5%) sub-cohorts. Combinations were rarely prescribed (<= 2.5%). Previously-treated patients were most frequently prescribed combinations in the DM (JMDC: 46.7%, MDV: 53.6%) and ASCVD (JMDC: 49.3%, MDV: 53.3%) sub-cohorts. Intensive statins were rarely used by previously-untreated (<= 1%) or previously-treated (<= 8%) patients in either sub-cohort. Approximately half of previously-untreated patients discontinued hyperlipidemia therapy within 12 months. Adherence was >= 80% across most drug classes.
   Conclusions: Many Japanese hyperlipidemia patients with DM or ASCVD are prescribed single-agent lipid-lowering therapy. Use of intensive therapy is lower than expected, and is suggestive of under-treatment. The low persistence rates are concerning, and warrant further study.

AB Background and aims: Studies on high ankle-brachial index (ABI) to predict mortality risk have yielded conflicting results. This meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the association between abnormally high ABI and risk of cardiovascular or all-cause mortality.
   Methods: Pubmed and Embase databases were systematically searched for relevant articles published up to August 15, 2018. Longitudinal observational studies that evaluated the association between abnormally high ABI at baseline and risk of cardiovascular or all-cause mortality were included. Pooled results were expressed as risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) for the abnormal high versus the reference normal ABI category.
   Results: Eighteen studies enrolling 60,467 participants were included. Abnormally high ABI was associated with an increased risk of all-cause mortality (RR 1.50; 95% CI 1.27-1.77) and cardiovascular mortality (RR 1.84; 95% CI 1.54-2.20). The pooled RR of all-cause mortality was 1.45 (95% CI 1.16-1.82) for the general population, 1.67 (95% CI 1.03-2.71) for chronic kidney disease (CKD)/hemodialysis patients, and 1.55 (95% CI 1.10-2.20) for suspected or established cardiovascular disease (CVD) patients, respectively. The pooled RR of cardiovascular mortality was 1.84 (95% CI 1.43-2.38) for the general population, 4.28 (95% CI 2.18-8.40) for CKD/hemodialysis patients, and 1.58 (95% CI 1.22-2.05) for suspected or established CVD patients, respectively.
   Conclusions: Abnormally high ABI is independently associated with an increased risk of all-cause mortality. However, interpretation of the association between abnormally high ABI and cardiovascular mortality should be done with caution because of the likelihood of publication bias.

AB Background and aims: High concentrations of low density lipoprotein (LDL) triglycerides have been associated with prevalent angiographic coronary artery disease. The present analysis was designed to investigate the association of LDL triglycerides with cardiovascular mortality and to explore possible mechanisms that may link LDL triglycerides to cardiovascular risk.
   Methods: LDL triglycerides were measured in 3140 participants of the Ludwigshafen Risk and Cardiovascular Health (LURIC) study. They were prospectively followed for cardiovascular mortality (median duration 9.9 years). Genome wide association data for LDL triglycerides were available for 2900 LURIC participants. Genetic data and measurements of hepatic lipase activity were available for 478 participants of the HERITAGE Family study. Genome wide association data for cardiovascular disease were available for 184,305 participants of the CARDIoGRAMplusC4D consortium.
   Results: There was a continuous positive association between LDL triglycerides and cardiovascular mortality (hazard ratio for 5th vs. 1st quintile = 2.53, p < 0.001) and this association was similar in males and females. Genome wide association analysis in LURIC revealed that LDL triglycerides were strongly associated with variation in the hepatic lipase region (p < 10(-15) for rs1800588 and rs10468017). The LDL triglyceride raising alleles in rs1800588 and rs10468017 were associated with low hepatic lipase activity in HERITAGE and increased cardiovascular risk in CARDIoGRAMplusC4D. Two-sample Mendelian randomization analysis (HERITAGE and CARDIoGRAMplusC4D) using rs1800588 and rs10468017 as instrumental variable suggested that low hepatic lipase activity may cause increased cardiovascular risk (p = 0.013).
   Conclusions: Low hepatic lipase activity may link high LDL triglycerides to increased cardiovascular risk.

AB Background and aims: Type I hyperlipoproteinemia is an autosomal recessive disorder of lipoprotein metabolism caused by mutations in the LPL gene, with an estimated prevalence in the general population of 1 in a million. In this work, we studied the molecular mechanism of two known mutations in the LPL gene in ex vivo and in vitro experiments and also the effect of two splice site mutations in ex vivo experiments.
   Methods: Two patients with hypertriglyceridemia were selected from the Lipid Clinic in Vienna. The first patient was compound heterozygote for c.680T > C (exon 5; p.V200A) and c. 1139+1G > A (intron 7 splice site). The second patient was compound heterozygote for c. 953A > G (exon 6; p.N291S) and c.1019-3C > A (intron 6 splice site).
   The LPL gene was sequenced and post-heparin plasma samples (ex vivo) were used to test LPL activity. In vitro experiments were performed in HEK 293T/17 cells transiently transfected with wild type or mutant LPL plasmids. Cell lysate and media were used to evaluate LPL production, secretion, activity and dimerization by Western blot analysis and LPL enzymatic assay, respectively.
   Results: Our data show that in both patients, LPL activity is absent. V200A is a mutation that alters LPL secretion and activity whereas the N291S mutation affects LPL activity, but both mutations do not affect dimerization. The effect of these mutations in patients is more severe since they have splice site mutations on the other allele.
   Conclusions: We characterized these LPL mutations at the molecular level showing that are pathogenic.

   OUTCOMES
AB Background and aims: Diabetes increases risk for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). Current guidelines do not recommend measuring lipoprotein(a), another ASCVD risk factor, in these individuals. We examined the association of lipoprotein(a) levels with incident ASCVD events in persons with and without diabetes or prediabetes.
   Methods: Lipoprotein(a) and other ASCVD risk factors were measured at baseline (1996-1998) in the biracial Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities study; participants without prevalent ASCVD (coronary heart disease or stroke) were monitored similar to 15 years for incident ASCVD events.
   Results: Of 9871 eligible participants (mean age 63 years; 5816 women; 2155 African Americans), 1543 had diabetes and 3615 had prediabetes. Cumulative ASCVD incidence rates (event/1000-person years) were higher in participants with diabetes (26%) or prediabetes (13%) than in nondiabetic individuals (10%, p < 0.001). When comparing highest to lowest lipoprotein(a) categories (>= 50 mg/dL vs. <= 10 mg/dL), increasing lipoprotein( a) levels were significantly associated with increasing incident ASCVD events in Caucasian participants with prediabetes (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.35; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.07-1.69); p = 0.03) and diabetes (HR = 1.42; 95% CI 1.10-1.84; p < 0.01), but not those with normal fasting blood glucose. Adding lipoprotein (a) to Pooled Cohort Equation variables improved risk prediction in persons with diabetes (. in area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUC] 0.0087, net reclassification index [NRI] 0.1761) and prediabetes (.AUC 0.0025, NRI 0.0938).
   Conclusions: In this biracial cohort, elevated lipoprotein(a) levels in Caucasian individuals with diabetes or prediabetes were associated with further increased ASCVD risk. Adding lipoprotein(a) to traditional risk factors improved ASCVD risk prediction.

AB Background and aims: Unevenly socioeconomic development and nutrition transition might bring large variations in the epidemiology of dyslipidemia. We aimed to estimate the prevalence, awareness, treatment and control of dyslipidemia in different socioeconomic statuses and geographic regions in China, and to assess the associated factors and comorbidities of dyslipidemia.
   Methods: We included participants aged 45 years and above from a nationally representative investigation: the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study 2011. Dyslipidemia was defined based on the 2016 guideline of Chinese Prevention and Treatment of Dyslipidemia in adults. Multivariable logistic regression was adopted to assess the potentially associated factors and commodities of dyslipidemia.
   Results: In 2010, the prevalence of dyslipidemia was 42.84% among people aged 45 years and above. Low level of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) was the most common type of dyslipidemia. The awareness, treatment and control rates among dyslipidemic subjects were 20.27%, 14.41% and 4.94%, respectively. In dyslipidemic patients who were under treatment, the control rate was 34.26%. People aged 50-59 years were at a significantly higher risk of dyslipidemia than those aged 45-49 years. Male gender, living in North China, overweight, obesity, central obesity, hypertension, diabetes and hyperuricemia were significantly associated with a higher risk of dyslipidemia. Current alcohol drinking and underweight were linked to a lower prevalence of dyslipidemia.
   Conclusions: Our study revealed a high prevalence of dyslipidemia among middle-aged and older Chinese. The awareness, treatment and control rates were far from ideal and geographic inequality was highlighted. More efforts are needed to prevent and manage dyslipidemia in China.

AB Background and aims: The predictive value of traditional CV risk calculators is limited. Novel indicators of CVD progression are needed particularly in the young population. The main aim of this study was the identification of a molecular profile with added value to classical CV risk estimation.
   Methods: Eighty-one subjects (30-50 years) were classified in 3 groups according to their CV risk: healthy subjects; individuals with CV risk factors; and those who had suffered a previous CV event. The urine proteome was quantitatively analyzed and significantly altered proteins were identified between patients' groups, either related to CV risk or established organ damage. Target-MS and ELISA were used for confirmation in independent patients' cohorts. Systems Biology Analysis (SBA) was carried out to identify functional categories behind CVD.
   Results: 4309 proteins were identified, 75 of them differentially expressed. ADX, ECP, FETUB, GDF15, GUAD and NOTCH1 compose a fingerprint positively correlating with lifetime risk estimate (LTR QRISK). Best performance ROC curve was obtained when ECP, GDF15 and GUAD were combined (AUC = 0.96). SBA revealed oxidative stress response, dilated cardiomyopathy, signaling by Wnt and proteasome, as main functional processes related to CV risk.
   Conclusions: A novel urinary protein signature is shown, which correlates with CV risk estimation in young individuals. Pending further confirmation, this six-protein-panel could help in CV risk assessment.

DT Article
ID OUTCOMES
AB Background and aims: Statin pretreatment (SP) is associated with improved outcomes in acute ischemic stroke (AIS) patients. Collateral circulation status and final infarct volume (FIV) are independent predictors of functional outcome in AIS.
   Methods: We sought to evaluate the association of SP with collateral circulation and FIV in AIS patients. We used a random-effects model for all the analyses, and pooled standardized mean differences (SMDs) and odds ratios (OR) on the FIV and collateral status according to SP history, respectively.
   Results: We identified 9 eligible studies (1186 AIS patients). History of SP was associated with lower FIV (SMD = 0.25, 95% CI: 0.07-0.42, p = 0.005) compared to negative history of SP. A trend towards good collateral scores was observed in the SP group (OR = 1.45; 95% CI, 0.92-2.29, p = 0.11). Subgroup analysis demonstrated reduced FIV among atherosclerotic stroke patients with history of SP (SMD = 0.49; 95% CI, 0.19-0.80, p = 0.001).
   Conclusions: SP appears to be associated with decreased FIV, especially in atherosclerotic AIS.

TI Utility of novel serum biomarkers to predict subclinical
   atherosclerosis: A sub-analysis of the EISNER study

AB Background and aims: Certain novel biomarkers may predict atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) events; however, data on their relationship to coronary atherosclerosis and its progression as measured by coronary artery calcium (CAC) scanning is lacking. We evaluated the association between novel biomarkers and presence or progression of CAC.
   Methods: The EISNER study was a prospective trial of patients without known ASCVD. Data on CAC and several biomarkers (hs-CRP, LT beta R, osteopontin [OPN], RAGE, TNFR1 alpha and TROY) were available at baseline and 4-year follow-up. Biomarkers were standardized and summed for a composite score. CAC progression was defined by the square-root (CAC(SQRT)) method and rapid (top decile) progression. Adjusted regression models created a final prediction model for baseline CAC and CAC progression.
   Results: 1207 subjects (mean age 58.4 +/- 8 years, 53% male) were evaluated; 621 had a baseline CAC > 0, in whom 323 progressed by CAC(SQRT), and 121 rapidly progressed. Baseline CAC was associated only with OPN (p = 0.03), TROY (p = 0.0058) and TNFR1 alpha (p = 0.0039) in unadjusted analyses. In adjusted analyses, only OPN was independently related to CAC progression using CAC(SQRT) (p = 0.04).
   Conclusions: OPN identifies progression of atherosclerosis in persons free of ASCVD at baseline and may be a useful predictive tool to guide ASCVD prevention management.

AB Background and aims: The effects of influenza vaccination (IV) on stroke outcomes are unclear. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the outcomes after stroke in elderly individuals who have received an IV.
   Methods: We used Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database 2000-2009 claims data to conduct a nested stroke cohort study including 148,909 hospitalized stroke patients aged 66 years and older. Using a matching procedure by propensity score, we selected 25,248 stroke patients with IV and 25,248 stroke patients without IV for comparison. Logistic regression was used to calculate the odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CIs of post-stroke complications and in-hospital mortality associated with IV.
   Results: Stroke patients with IV had significantly lower risks of post-stroke pneumonia (OR = 0.79; 95% CI, 0.74-0.83), septicemia (OR = 0.78; 95% CI, 0.70-0.86), urinary tract infection (OR = 0.87; 95% CI, 0.83-0.92), and 30-day in-hospital mortality (OR = 0.60; 95% CI, 0.54-0.67) compared with non-IV stroke patients. Vaccinated stroke patients also had shorter hospital stays (p < 0.0001) and less medical expenditures (p < 0.0001) during stroke admission than the control group. Lower rates of post-stroke adverse events in patients with IV were noted in both sexes of all age groups with various types of stroke.
   Conclusions: Stroke patients with IV showed fewer complications and lower mortality compared with non-IV patients. These findings suggest the urgent need to promote IV for this susceptible population of stroke patients.

AB Background and aims: GlycA is a novel composite biomarker of systemic inflammation reflecting posttranslational glycosylation of acute phase reactants. GlycA has been associated with coronary artery calcium, cardiovascular disease (CVD) events and mortality. Vascular calcifications outside of the coronary arteries are risk markers of CVD and mortality. Whether GlycA is linked to extra-coronary calcifications (ECC) is not well established.
   Methods: We studied 6462 MESA participants free of clinical CVD who had plasma GlycA measured at baseline. ECCs [calcification in aortic valve (AVC), mitral annulus (MAC), ascending and descending thoracic aorta (ATAC, DTAC)] were ascertained at baseline and follow-up visit (median 2.3-yrs later) by cardiac CT. Poisson regression models with robust variance estimation assessed associations of GlycA with prevalent and incident ECC. Linear mixed models assessed the cross-sectional and 2-year change in ECC. Models were adjusted for demographic and lifestyle factors.
   Results: In cross-sectional analysis, GlycA (per SD increment) was positively associated with prevalent AVC, ATAC and DTAC with adjusted prevalence ratios (95% CI) of 1.08 (1.01-1.14), 1.18 (1.03-1.34) and 1.10 (1.06-1.14), respectively. There was also a significant association between GlycA and baseline extent of both ATAC and DTAC. Longitudinally, GlycA was positively associated with incident MAC and DTAC, with adjusted incidence ratios of 1.18 (1.03-1.37) and 1.17 (1.07-1.28), respectively. GlycA was also associated with 2-year change in MAC and DTAC extent.
   Conclusions: In this diverse cohort free from clinical CVD, we found GlycA was positively associated with prevalent and incident ECC measures, in particular for progression of MAC and DTAC.

AB Background and aims: Glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored high-density lipoprotein binding protein 1 (GPIHBP1) plays a crucial role in triglyceride hydrolysis, and GPIHBP1 deficiency leads to severe hyper-triglyceridemia (HTG). Gpihbp1 knockout (GKO) mice develop mild lesions in the aortic root at the age of 11 months. Herein, we investigated the effect of Gpihbp1 deficiency on atherosclerosis (AS) under diabetic conditions.
   Methods: For experiment 1, diabetes was induced in GKO and wild-type (WT) mice by injection of streptozotocin at 3 months of age and lasted for 4 months. For experiment 2, diabetes was induced in Gpihbp1/low-density lipoprotein receptor (Ldlr) double-knockout (GLDKO) mice, Ldlr knockout (LKO) mice were used as controls. The experiment was continued for 3 or 5 months. Plasma glucose and lipid levels were measured, and atherosclerotic lesions were analyzed at 3 and 5 months during the experiment.
   Results: No atherosclerotic lesions were detected in the aorta in GKO mice after 4 months of diabetes. Compared with LKO mice, GLDKO mice manifested enhanced aortic atherosclerotic lesions, decreased plaque stability, and increased oxidative stress and inflammation in plaques at 3 and 5 months after diabetes. Atherosclerotic lesions in the coronary artery and dilated remodeling in the aortic root were also found in GLDKO diabetic mice.
   Conclusions: Gpihbp1 deficiency accelerates the development of AS in the aorta, and the instability of plaques in LKO mice and diabetes promotes these pathologic processes with coronary AS. These findings were probably associated with HTG caused by Gpihbp1 deficiency and with increased oxidative stress and inflammation in the atherosclerotic lesions.

AB Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is highly prevalent and includes a spectrum of abnormalities ranging from steatosis to cirrhosis. In this review, we address recent evidence and limitations of studies that evaluated the association of NAFLD with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. NAFLD is considered an ectopic fat deposit associated with metabolic (insulin resistance, hyperglycemia and dyslipidemia), inflammatory, coagulation and blood pressure disturbances. Prospective studies have associated NAFLD presence and severity, particularly steatohepatitis and fibrosis, with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease. However, these studies are limited by heterogeneity concerning NAFLD diagnostic criteria and disease severity stratification, as well as by the presence of confounding factors. In addition, genetic variants predisposing to NAFLD, such as the PNPLA3 I148M mutation, were not consistently associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular events. Therefore, currently, it is not possible to prove a causal relation between NAFLD and cardiovascular disease. Furthermore, there is presently no evidence that NAFLD diagnosis can be used as a tool to improve cardiovascular risk stratification and modify treatment. Specific treatments for NAFLD are being developed and must be tested prospectively in adequately designed trials to determine the potential of reducing both hepatic and cardiovascular diseases and to prove whether NAFLD is indeed a cause of atherosclerosis.

AB Background and aims: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients, however, the underlying mechanisms that link CKD and CVD are not fully understood and limited treatment options exist in this high-risk population. microRNAs (miRNA) are critical regulators of gene expression for many biological processes in atherosclerosis, including endothelial dysfunction and inflammation. We hypothesized that renal injury-induced endothelial miRNAs promote atherosclerosis. Here, we demonstrate that dual inhibition of endothelial miRNAs inhibits atherosclerosis in the setting of renal injury.
   Methods: Aortic endothelial miRNAs were analyzed in apolipoprotein E-deficient (Apoe(-/-)) mice with renal damage (5/6 nephrectomy, 5/6Nx) by real-time PCR. Endothelial miR-92a-3p and miR-489-3p were inhibited by locked-nucleic acid (LNA) miRNA inhibitors complexed to HDL.
   Results: Renal injury significantly increased endothelial miR-92a-3p levels in Apoe(-/-); 5/6Nx mice. Dual inhibition of miR-92a-3p and miR-489-3p in Apoe(-/-); 5/6Nx with a single injection of HDL + LNA inhibitors significantly reduced atherosclerotic lesion area by 28.6% compared to HDL + LNA scramble (LNA-Scr) controls. To examine the impact of dual LNA treatment on aortic endothelial gene expression, total RNA sequencing was completed, and multiple putative target genes and pathways were identified to be significantly altered, including the STAT3 immune response pathway. Among the differentially expressed genes, Tgfb2 and Fam220a were identified as putative targets of miR-489-3p and miR-92a-3p, respectively. Both Tgfb2 and Fam220a were significantly increased in aortic endothelium after miRNA inhibition in vivo compared to HDL + LNA-Scr controls. Furthermore, Tgfb2 and Fam220a were validated with gene reporter assays as direct targets of miR-489-3p and miR-92a-3p, respectively. In human coronary artery endothelial cells, over-expression and inhibition of miR-92a-3p decreased and increased FAM220A expression, respectively. Moreover, miR-92a-3p overexpression increased STAT3 phosphorylation, likely through direct regulation of FAM220A, a negative regulator of STAT3 phosphorylation.
   Conclusions: These results support endothelial miRNAs as therapeutic targets and dual miRNA inhibition as viable strategy to reduce CKD-associated atherosclerosis.

TI The Barcelona-Asymptomatic Intracranial Atherosclerosis study:
   Subclinical intracranial atherosclerosis as predictor of long-term
   vascular events
SO ATHEROSCLEROSIS
LA English
DT Article
DE Intracranial atherosclerosis; Vascular disease
ID RISK-FACTORS; PREVALENCE; STROKE; STENOSIS; BURDEN; ASIA
AB Background and aims: Symptomatic intracranial atherosclerosis (ICAS) is associated with a high risk of stroke recurrence and occurrence of other vascular events. However, ICAS has been poorly studied from its asymptomatic stage. The objective of our study was to determine if subclinical intracranial atherosclerosis is associated with long-term incident vascular events in Caucasians.
   Methods: The Barcelona-Asymptomatic Intracranial Atherosclerosis (AsIA) Study is a population-based study that enrolled 933 subjects with a moderate-high vascular risk and without history of stroke or coronary disease, and determined the prevalence of asymptomatic ICAS and associated risk factors. At baseline visit, carotid atherosclerosis and ICAS were screened by color-coded duplex ultrasound, and moderate-severe stenosis was confirmed by magnetic resonance angiography. At baseline, 8.9% of subjects had asymptomatic ICAS, of whom 3.3% were moderate-severe. In the longitudinal phase, subjects were prospectively followed-up to assess the incidence of a combined primary endpoint of vascular events (stroke, acute coronary syndrome and/or vascular death).
   Results: After 7.17 years of follow-up, there were 51 incident cerebrovascular events (16 transient ischemic attacks, 27 ischemic, 8 hemorrhagic strokes), 63 incident coronary events and 23 vascular deaths. After multivariate Cox regression analyses adjusted by age, sex, vascular risk and presence of carotid plaques, ICAS was an independent predictor for overall vascular events (HR 1.83 [1.10-3.03], p = 0.020), and moderate-severe intracranial stenosis was also an independent predictor for cerebrovascular events (HR 2.66 [1.02-6.94], p = 0.046).
   Conclusions: Asymptomatic ICAS is independently associated with the incidence of future vascular events in our population. These findings might have implications for the development of primary prevention strategies.

   WALL; PREDICTORS; ARTERY; MEN
AB Background and aims: While numerous cross-sectional studies have demonstrated an inverse relationship between cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) and carotid atherosclerosis in middle age, much less is known about the association of midlife CRF with carotid atherosclerosis in later life.
   Methods: We studied 1094 participants, free of cardiovascular disease, who completed a maximal exercise test (GXT) for an objective measure of CRF between ages 40 and 59 and carotid ultrasound after the age of 59, with at least five years between studies. Carotid intima media thickness was measured. Assessments were also made regarding the presence of plaque and percent stenosis in four regions: common carotid, bulb, internal carotid and external carotid arteries. Multivariable logistic regression models were constructed to estimate the association of CRF with carotid artery disease.
   Results: At the time of GXT and carotid scan, participants were aged 50.7 +/- 5.7 years and 69.3 +/- 6.4 years, respectively. Almost half of participants had high midlife CRF (48.6%); 41.3% and 10.1% had moderate and low CRF, respectively. Over a mean follow-up period of 18.6 +/- 8.5 years, the odds of having carotid artery disease in later life in the high CRF group was 0.50 (95% CI: 0.29-0.87) compared with the low CRF group. Each 1 MET increase in CRF was associated with 10% lower odds of having carotid artery disease (OR = 0.89, 95% CI: 0.80-0.98).
   Conclusions: Midlife CRF was inversely associated with carotid artery disease measured almost two decades later. This may represent a mechanistic link between high midlife CRF and reduced risk of stroke in later life.

AB Background and aims: The aim of this work was to compared the effect of lipid lowering drugs among familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) subjects with a functional mutation in LDLR (LDLR FH) and FH with the p. (Leu167del) mutation in APOE.
   Methods: We retrospectively selected all adults with the p.(Leu167del) mutation on lipid-lowering treatment (n = 22) attending the Lipid Unit at the Hospital Miguel Servet. Age and sex matched LDLR FH from the same Unit were randomly selected as a control group (n = 44).
   Results: The mean percentage reduction in LDLc was significantly higher in the p.(Leu167del) carriers (-52.1%) than in the LDLR FH (-39.7%) (p = 0.040) when on high intensity statins. Similar differences between groups were observed in non-HDLc -49.4% and -36.4%, respectively (p = 0.030).
   Conclusions: Subjects with p.(Leu167del) mutation have a higher lipid-lowering response to statins with or without ezetimibe than LDLR FH. This supports the use of genetics for a more efficient management of FH.

AB Background and aims: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is associated with high morbidity and mortality. Studies in animal models and humans suggested that glucose. 6. phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency, a genetically inherited condition causing haemolytic anemia, may be a risk factor for CVD. This hypothesis was tested in a large cohort from Northern Sardinia, where the population prevalence of G6PD deficiency is the highest in the Mediterranean area.
   Methods: A retrospective observational case. control study was performed using clinical records of 9604 patients undergoing digestive endoscopy between 2002 and 2017, with a known G6PD status and a complete clinical history including CVD and leading CVD risk factors. To circumvent covariates imbalance between cases and controls, a 1: 2 propensity score. matched analysis was performed.
   Results: Major predictors of CVD, as expected, were age (OR 1.07; 95% CI 1.06-1.08), male sex (1.63; 95% CI 1.29-2.06), high blood pressure (OR 1.46; 95% CI 1.16-1.84), smoking (OR 3.03; 95% CI 2.42-3.79), diabetes (OR 1.65; 95% CI 1.23-2.21) and hypercholesterolemia (OR 2.20; 95% CI 1.71-2.84). The propensity score matching procedure resulted in 1123 G6PD deficient patients and 2246 patients with normal enzyme activity. When G6PD status was regressed on the CVD, including propensity score as a continuous covariate, an OR of 1.71 (95% CI 1.17-2.49; p = 0.006) was obtained.
   Conclusions: G6PD deficiency is significantly associated with increased risk of CVD, although the underlying mechanisms are still poorly understood. The loss of important protective pathways against oxidative stress, especially in the early stages of atherogenesis, might play a crucial role.

AB Background and aims: Sedentary lifestyle, unlike leisure time physical activity (PA), is associated with atherosclerosis progression. Regarding the interrelationship between television watching, as a sedentary behavior pattern, and cardiovascular disease burden, few data exist.
   Methods: In this cross-sectional epidemiological study based on 2043 inhabitants of the Corinthia region, in Greece, ultrasonography was used to measure carotid intima-media thickness (IMT) in both carotid arteries. The average (meanIMT) and maximum thickness (maxIMT) were determined as representative values of subclinical atherosclerosis. We evaluated PA using the self-reported International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ). Based on specific questions, the average hours per week spent on watching television (TV), videos or DVD was calculated for each participant.
   Results: According to TV viewing time, subjects were categorized into the low (<= 7 h/week), moderate (7(>) TV hours/week <= 21) and high ((>)21 h/week) TV viewing time groups. Prevalence of carotid atheromatic plaque was lower in the low TV viewing time group compared to the moderate and high TV viewing time groups (p = 0.02). TV viewing time was associated with increased carotid IMT (p = 0.03) and the prevalence of carotid atheromatic plaque (p = 0.02), even after adjustment for age, body mass index, cardiovascular risk factors or history of cardiovascular disease. Subjects in the high TV viewing time group have 80% increase odds of carotid atheromatic plaque compared to patients categorized in the low TV viewing time group (p = 0.01).
   Conclusions: The present findings have important public health implications, providing a better understanding of the components of sedentary behavior that are associated with atherosclerotic progression.

AB Whether apoB adds significantly to the assessment of the risk and therapy of the atherogenic dyslipoproteinemias has been vigorously contested over many years. That trapping of apoB lipoprotein particles within the arterial wall is fundamental to the initiation and maturation of atherosclerotic lesions within the arterial wall is now widely accepted. At the same time, the concept that primary prevention should be based on the risk of a cardiovascular event, a measure that integrates the effects of age, sex, blood pressure, lipids and other factors, has also become widely accepted. Within the risk framework, the issue becomes whether apoB adds significantly to the assessment of risk. On the other hand, it can be argued that the risk model undervalues how important a role that LDL and blood pressure play as causes of atherosclerosis and that when considered as causes, the importance of apoB emerges. These are the two sides of the debate that will be presented in the article that follows: one will highlight the pros of measuring apoB, the second the cons. The reader can make up his or her mind which side of the issue they favour.

   MECHANISMS
AB Background and aims: Thrombocytopenia in scavenger receptor BI (SR-BI) knockout mice is suggested to result from augmented platelet clearance induced by elevated intracellular unesterified cholesterol (UC) levels. We hypothesize that SR-BI deficiency may also influence platelet production at the level of its precursor cell in the bone marrow, the megakaryocyte.
   Methods: In this study, we compared megakaryopoiesis and platelet production in SR-BI knockout and wild-type mice.
   Results: In line with our hypothesis, megakaryocytes from SR-BI knockout mice exhibited UC accumulation while no accumulation of UC was detectable in wild-type megakaryocytes. Bone marrow expression of transcription factors involved in megakaryocyte maturation was induced, but megakaryocyte counts were unchanged in bone marrow of SR-BI knockout mice. Interestingly, we did find a striking 62% decrease (p < 0.01) in proplatelet production by SR-BI knockout megakaryocytes. SR-BI knockout mice displayed an impaired increase in circulating platelet concentrations and bone marrow megakaryocyte numbers upon thrombopoietin challenge. Importantly, megakaryocytes from normolipidemic bone marrow-specific SR-BI knockout mice exhibited a normal ability to produce proplatelets. Moreover, bone marrow-specific deletion of SR-BI did not impair the thrombopoietin response or induce thrombocytopenia, confirming that absence of megakaryocyte SR-BI does not underlie the thrombocytopenic phenotype in total body SR-BI knockout mice.
   Conclusions: In conclusion, the elevation of plasma unesterified cholesterol levels impairs megakaryopoiesis and platelet production in SR-BI knockout mice. Our findings suggest that, in addition to an increased platelet clearance, a decrease in platelet production may also, in part, explain the thrombocytopenic phenotype associated with SR-BI deficiency in mice.

AB Background and aims: Measures of HDL function are emerging tools for assessing cardiovascular disease (CVD) event risk. HDL-apoA-I exchange (HAE) reflects HDL capacity for reverse cholesterol transport.
   Methods: HAE was measured in 93 participants with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and at least one additional CVD risk factor in the Asker and Baerum Cardiovascular Diabetes study. At baseline and after seven years, the atherosclerotic burden was assessed by invasive coronary angiography. Major CVD events were registered throughout the study.
   Results: Linear regression analysis demonstrated a significant inverse association between HAE and atherosclerotic burden. Cox proportional hazard regression analysis showed a significant association between HAE and a composite of major CVD events when controlling for waist-hip ratio, HR = 0.89, 95% CI = 0.80-1.00 and p = 0.040.
   Conclusions: Despite the relatively small size of the study population and the limited number of CVD events, these findings suggest that HAE provides valuable information in determining CVD risk.

AB Background and aims: The relationship between blood pressure (BP) levels given in the new hypertension guidelines by the American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) and subclinical coronary atherosclerosis in low-risk young adults is unknown. We evaluated the association between the new BP categories and coronary artery calcium (CAC) in low-risk, young and middle-aged adults.
   Methods: We performed a cross-sectional study of 96,166 Koreans who underwent a health examination including cardiac tomography estimation of CAC scores in 2012-2017. BP categories were defined according to the 2017 ACC/AHA guidelines. We used Poisson regression models with robust variance to calculate prevalence ratios (PRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for prevalent CAC > 0.
   Results: Overall, higher BP categories were associated with higher CAC scores in both young (aged 20-39) and middle-aged people (aged 40 years or more). After adjusting for possible confounders, including traditional cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors, the multivariable-adjusted PRs (95% CI) for prevalent CAC, comparing elevated BP and stage 1 and 2 hypertension to normal BP, were 1.27 (1.08-1.49), 1.45 (1.28-1.63), and 2.02 (1.67-2.43), respectively, among those aged 20-39 years and 1.25 (1.15-1.36), 1.29 (1.23-1.35), and 1.46 (1.36-1.57), respectively, among those aged >= 40 years. This association was also evident in those with a 10-year CVD risk of <10%.
   Conclusions: Higher BP categories were positively associated with prevalent CAC, and that association began in the elevated BP category, even in a young and low-risk population.

AB Background and aims: Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is a clinical manifestation of extracoronary atherosclerosis. Many risk factors are involved in the process of PAD, but the association between serum magnesium (Mg) and PAD is not clear. Our study aimed to investigate whether serum Mg is associated with PAD incidence.
   Methods: A total of 13,826 participants (aged 40-64 years) in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study (1987-1989) without prior PAD were included in the final analysis. Serum Mg levels were measured at visits 1 and 2. PAD was defined as an ankle brachial index less than 0.9, or hospitalization with a PAD diagnosis. Cox regression was used to calculate hazard ratios (HRs) for incidence of PAD and serum Mg.
   Results: During a median follow-up of 24.4 years, 1364 (48.4% female) PAD events were observed. After multiple adjustment, participants in the lowest (<= 1.4 mEq/L) category of serum Mg compared with the highest (>= 1.8 mEq/L) ones were at higher PAD risk (HR: 1.3; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.06-1.58) (p value = 0.004). The HRs for PAD in 1.5, 1.6 and 1.7 mEq/L of serum Mg were 1.29 (95% CI: 1.08-1.54), 1.05 (95% CI: 0.89-1.24), and 1.0 (95% CI: 0.85-1.18), respectively.
   Conclusions: Low serum Mg was independently associated with an increased prevalence of PAD in the large population-based study; further studies are needed to confirm our findings.

AB Background and aims: The extent and relation of multisite atherosclerosis to cardiovascular disease (CVD) in metabolic syndrome (MetS) and diabetes (DM) are not well documented. We examined the extent of multisite atherosclerosis and its prognostic value for CVD events in MetS and DM.
   Methods: In CVD-free subjects from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis, multisite atherosclerosis was measured as: (1) the number of arterial beds involved (coronary calcium > 0, abdominal aortic calcium > 0, carotid intima-media thickness >= 1 mm and ankle brachial index < 1 or >= 1.4); (2) a composite score summing the quartile rank for each atherosclerosis measure. Hazard ratios (HRs) and c-statistics were calculated for incident CVD and coronary heart disease (CHD) over 10.6 years.
   Results: Of 1675 individuals (mean age 64 years, 51% male), 33.4% had MetS and 15.9% had DM. The number of atherosclerotic sites was higher in those with DM (mean +/- SD = 1.67 +/- 1.15) and MetS (1.49 +/- 1.12) versus neither MetS/DM (1.09 +/- 1.09) (p < 0.0001). CVD rates per 1000 person-years ranged from 3.5, 8.2, and 10.0 in those with 0 sites positive to 35.1, 79.6 and 103.4 in those with 4 sites positive among neither DM/MetS, MetS and DM groups, respectively. HRs (95% CI) for CVD comparing those with 4 vs. 0 atherosclerotic sites were 4.0 (0.8-19.1), 4.9 (2.0-12.0), and 14.4 (3.6-57.6), respectively. C-statistics adding multisite atherosclerosis measures increased over models without the measures and with CIMT or ABI but not CAC.
   Conclusions: Multisite atherosclerosis is greater with MetS or DM, and predicts CVD and CHD events. Risk prediction is improved over CIMT and ABI but not CAC.

AB Background and aims: Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is a an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by very high levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). It is estimated that >85% of all FH-causing mutations involve genetic variants in the LDL receptor (LDLR). To date, 795 single amino acid LDLR missense mutations have been reported in the Leiden Open Variation Database (LOVD). However, the functional impact of these variants on the LDLR pathway has received little attention and remains poorly understood. We aim to establish a systematic functional prediction model for LDLR single missense mutations.
   Methods: Using a combined structural modeling and bioinformatics algorithm, we developed an in silico prediction model called "Structure-based Functional Impact Prediction for Mutation Identification" (SFIP-MutID) for FH with LDLR single missense mutations. We compared the pathogenicity and functional impact predictions of our model to those of other conventional tools with experimentally validated variants, as well as in vitro functional test results for patients with LDLR variants.
   Results: Our SFIP-MutID model systematically predicted 13,167 potential LDLR single amino acid missense substitutions with biological effects. The functional impact of 52 out of 54 specific mutations with reported in vitro experimental data was predicted correctly. Further functional tests on LDLR variants from patients were also consistent with the prediction of our model.
   Conclusions: Our LDLR structure-based computational model predicted the pathogenicity of LDLR missense mutations by linking genotypes with LDLR functional phenotypes. Our model complements other prediction tools for variant interpretation and facilitates the precision diagnosis and treatment of FH and atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases.

AB Background and aims: Coronary reperfusion with HDL from healthy volunteers attenuates ischemia and reperfusion injury in animal models. In myocardial infarction (MI) patients, such an interaction is unclear. Hence, our first objective was to verify if there is interaction between HDL-C and MI mass in patients and the role of coronary reperfusion in the interaction. Furthermore, we investigated whether the effect in MI size of reperfusion with HDL obtained from healthy participants or MI patients could differ.
   Methods: HDL-C was measured the first day after MI and MI mass was quantified by cardiac magnetic resonance (n = 94) and peak CKMB (n = 393). In an ex vivo rat heart model, we compared MI area and dP/dt max after coronary reperfusion with HDL from MI patients or healthy volunteers.
   Results: HDL-C above the median (35 mg/dL) was associated with higher peak CKMB [255 (145-415) vs. 136 (84-287) UI/L; p = 0.02], higher MI mass [17 (9-21) vs. 10 (6-14) g; p < 0.01] and lower left ventricular ejection fraction [47 (34-53) vs. 51 (43-59); p = 0.02] than their counterparts. In restricted cubic spline and multivariate linear regression, HDL-C was directly associated with peak CKMB (p < 0.01) and MI mass (p < 0.01) only in reperfused patients with time to reperfusion < 4 h. Reperfusion with healthy HDL, but not from MI patients, reduced MI mass (p < 0.01) and improved dP/dt max (p = 0.02).
   Conclusions: In MI patients undergoing early coronary reperfusion, HDL-C levels at admission are directly associated with MI size. In contrast to healthy HDL, reperfusion with HDL from MI patients do not reduce MI area in an ex vivo animal model.

AB Background and aims: Dyslipidemia is a major risk factor for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). As key regulators of lipoprotein metabolism, apolipoproteins (apos) are discussed as vascular risk factors. This study aimed to analyze associations of major plasma apos with coronary artery disease (CAD), peripheral artery disease (PAD) and carotid artery plaque (CAP) to elucidate their diagnostic potential in risk assessment.
   Methods: ApoA-I, apoA-II, apoA-IV, apoB-100, apoC-I, apoC-III, apoE, and apoJ were simultaneously quantified in 3 mu L EDTA-plasma by LC-MS/MS in a case-control subgroup of the Leipziger LIFE-Heart Study (N = 911). Confounder analysis with demographic, clinical covariates and serum lipids, cardiac, inflammatory, and hepatic markers were performed. Apos were associated with CAD, CAP, and PAD in a multivariate regression model.
   Results: Fasting and statin therapy showed strongest effects on apo concentrations. Inverse correlations of HDL-related apos A-I, A-II, A-IV, and C-I were observed for troponin T and interleukin 6. Concentrations of apos A-II, B-100, C-I, and E were decreased under statin therapy. After adjustment for influencing factors and related lipids, only apoB-100 (odds ratio per one SD [OR], 1.39; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.05-1.84) was independently associated with CAD while apoA-IV (OR, 0.74; 95% CI 0.58-0.95) indicated PAD. ApoB-100 (OR, 1.55; 95% CI, 1.18-2.04), apoC-III (OR, 1.30; 95% CI, 1.06-1.58), and apoE (OR, 1.34; 95% CI, 1.13-1.58) were associated with CAP.
   Conclusions: Triglyceride rich lipoproteins (TRLs) associated apos A-IV, B-100, C-III, and E are independently associated with stable ASCVD, providing further evidence for a potential role of TRLs in atherogenesis.

AB A large number of epidemiological studies in ethnically diverse populations show that lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] levels above 30-50 mg/dL are significantly associated with calcific aortic valve stenosis, although less so in African Americans. Patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (he-FH) have a marked lifelong elevation of serum low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) level, and the prevalence of aortic valve calcification (AVC) is at least two-fold higher among adult he-FH patients compared with healthy controls. Additionally, Lp(a) levels above 50 mg/dL were recently found to be an independent risk factor for AVC among asymptomatic statin-treated he-FH patients. Given that worldwide an estimated 1.4 billion people have an Lp(a) level over 50 mg/dL, and that one out of 250 individuals has he-FH, then globally about 5 million he-FH patients should have an Lp(a) level higher than 50 mg/dL. However, because Lp(a) levels are, on average, significantly higher in he-FH patients than the general population, the actual number of he-FH patients with such high Lp(a) levels must be even higher.
   We proposed recently that Lp(a) life-years is a useful metric of cumulative burden of risk for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), and now posit that this metric may be extended to the development of AVC. The Lp(a) life-years illustrates the age-dependent exposure to a given Lp(a) level (years x mg/dL). Effective novel pharmacotherapies using apo(a) antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) or small interfering RNA (siRNA)-based therapies targeting the hepatic expression of apo(a) offer unprecedented potential for significant reduction in the cumulative exposure of the aortic valves to Lp(a), and need to be tested in controlled clinical trials on the progression of AVC.

   inflammation
ID OBESITY; HYPERLIPIDEMIA; MONOCYTOSIS; RECRUITMENT; RISK
AB Background and aims: Obese individuals have a higher risk of developing atherosclerosis, possibly driven by adipose tissue (AT) inflammation. We recently showed that AT macrophages (ATMs), which accumulate in the expanding obese AT, produce mediators causing immune cell recruitment from the bone marrow. In the current study, we evaluated whether ATMs are directly involved in atherosclerotic plaque development.
   Methods: Lean ldlr(-/-) acceptor mice received visceral AT (vAT) from lean, obese, or ATM-depleted obese ldlr(-/-) mice. Acceptor mice were fed high cholesterol diet (HCD) for 4 weeks before and 8 weeks after AT transplantation to induce atherosclerosis. Atherosclerotic plaque development was studied 8 weeks after transplantation.
   Results: Transplanting donor vAT from obese mice increased circulating triglycerides and B-cells, but decreased Ly6c(-) monocytes. Plasma cholesterol, Ly6c(+) monocytes, T-cells, NK-cells and eosinophils were unaffected. Depleting ATMs from obese AT using clodronate liposomes prior to vAT transplantation prevented the increase in triglycerides and B-cells and decrease in Ly6c(-) monocytes, but did increase eosinophils. Circulating Cxcl1 was reduced by obese AT transplantation and Ifn-gamma tended to be increased while Tnf and Il-1 beta were unaffected. ATM-depleted obese AT transplantation also reduced Cxcl1, but increased circulating Tnf levels. However, obese AT transplantation with or without depletion of ATMs did not influence atherosclerotic plaque size, phenotype, or stability.
   Conclusions: ATMs from obese vAT do not affect atherosclerotic plaque development or phenotype.

TI LncRNA HOXA-AS2 represses endothelium inflammation by regulating the
   activity of NF-kappa B signaling

AB Background and aims: Endothelium inflammation, which can lead to endothelial activation and dysfunction, is widely accepted as the major event in multiple vascular disorders. The lncRNA HOXA-AS2 was previously reported to be involved in multiple inflammation-linked cancers. However, the role of HOXA-AS2 in endothelium inflammation is poorly understood. This study aims to determine the regulatory role of HOXA-AS2 in endothelium inflammation and related vascular diseases.
   Methods: High throughput mRNA sequencing was performed to establish expression profiles after HOXA-AS2 depletion. We extracted total RNAs of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells from normal control group and experimental group with carotid artery atherosclerosis, and performed qRT-PCR to assay the correlation between HOXA-AS2 expression and inflammatory vascular diseases.
   Results: Inhibition of HOXA-AS2 can induce the activation of NF-kappa B signaling and subsequent inflammatory response. More importantly, HOXA-AS2 is inversely found to be inversely regulated by NF-kappa B in a negative feedback manner by helping recruit BRD4/P-TEFb complex to HOXA-AS2 promoter region, therefore facilitating release of the promoter-proximal paused RNA polymerase II and activating transcription elongation.
   Conclusions: We identify HOXA-AS2 as a critical repressor of endothelium inflammation. Moreover, this study offers us a new way to balance the NF-kappa B signaling-driven excessive endothelium inflammation by establishing a NF-kappa B/HOXA-AS2 negative feedback loop. Based on these findings, we conclude that HOXA-AS2 may serve as a crucial therapeutic target for various vascular disorders which are significantly associated with endothelium inflammation.

AB Background and aims: Stabilin-1 (STAB1) is a scavenger receptor expressed on alternatively activated macrophages and sinusoidal endothelial cells. Its ligands include oxidized low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and the extracellular matrix glycoprotein SPARC and it is present in both human and murine atherosclerotic lesions. We aimed to investigate the effect of specific deletion of STAB1 in bone marrow-derived cells, including macrophages on atherosclerotic lesion formation in mice.
   Methods: Lethally irradiated hypercholesterolemic LDL receptor knockout mice received either wildtype (WT) or STAB1 knockout (STAB1 KO) bone marrow. Bone marrow transplanted mice were fed a Western-type diet for 9 weeks to induce atherosclerotic lesion formation.
   Results: Interestingly, LDL receptor knockout mice reconstituted with STAB1 KO bone marrow showed increased body weight gain (two-way ANOVA: p < 0.001) and larger white adipocyte cell sizes (43% increase in cell area; p < 0.05) as compared to WT bone marrow transplanted mice, which correlated positively (r = 0.82; p < 0.001). This was paralleled by a significant increase in white adipose tissue relative mRNA expression levels of the adipokine leptin (+94% p < 0.05). Despite these changes, no differences in serum lipid levels, the extent of in vivo macrophage foam cell formation or circulating leukocyte concentrations were observed. Moreover, the size and composition of atherosclerotic lesions was not different between the two experimental groups.
   Conclusions: Bone marrow-specific Stabilin-1 deletion does not affect the susceptibility for atherosclerosis in mice. However, the increased body weight gain and adipocyte cell size highlight a potential role for leukocyte STAB1 in the development of metabolic disorders.

AB Background and aims: Omega-3 fatty acids are known to have several cardioprotective effects. Our aim was to investigate the effects of intakes of fish and Camelina sativa oil (CSO), rich in alpha-linolenic acid, on the atherogenic and anti-atherogenic functions of LDL and HDL particles.
   Methods: Altogether, 88 volunteers with impaired glucose metabolism were randomly assigned to CSO (10 g of alpha-linolenic acid/day), fatty fish (4 fish meals/week), lean fish (4 fish meals/week) or control group for 12 weeks. 79 subjects completed the study. The binding of lipoproteins to aortic proteoglycans, LDL aggregation and activation of endothelial cells by LDL and cholesterol efflux capacity of HDL were determined in vitro.
   Results: Intake of CSO decreased the binding of lipoproteins to aortic proteoglycans in a non-normalized model (p = 0.006). After normalizing with serum concentrations of non-HDL cholesterol, apolipoprotein B (apoB) or LDL cholesterol, which decreased in the CSO group, the change was no longer statistically significant. In the fish groups, there were no changes in the binding of lipoproteins to proteoglycans. Regarding other lipoprotein functions, there were no changes in any of the groups.
   Conclusions: Intake of CSO decreases the binding of lipoproteins to aortic proteoglycans by decreasing serum LDL cholesterol concentration, which suggests that the level of apoB-containing lipoproteins in the circulation is the main driver of lipoprotein retention within the arterial wall. Intake of fish or CSO has no effects on other lipoprotein functions.

AB Background and aims: Platelets play a fundamental role in the increased atherothrombotic risk related to central obesity since they show hyperactivation and lower sensitivity to antiplatelet therapy in obese patients. The main goal of this study was to identify platelet biomarkers related to the risk of atherothrombosis in obese patients, confirm platelet activation levels in these patients, and identify altered activation pathways.
   Methods: Platelets were obtained from cohorts of obese patients and age-and sex-matched lean controls. Biochemical and proteome analyses were done by two-dimensional differential in-gel electrophoresis (2D-DIGE), mass spectrometry, and immunoblotting. Functional and mechanistic studies were conducted with aggregation assays and flow cytometry.
   Results: We confirmed an up-regulation of alpha IIb and fibrinogen isoforms in platelets from obese patients. A complementary platelet aggregation approach showed platelets from obese patients are hyper-reactive in response to collagen and collagen-related peptide (CRP), revealing the collagen receptor Glycoprotein VI (GPVI) signalling as one of the altered pathways. We also found the active form of Src (pTyr418) is up-regulated in platelets from obese individuals, which links proteomics to aggregation data. Moreover, we showed that CRP-activated platelets present higher levels of tyrosine phosphorylated PLC gamma 2 in obese patients, confirming alterations in GPVI signalling. In line with the above, flow cytometry studies show higher surface expression levels of total GPVI and GPVI-dimer in obese platelets, both correlating with BMI.
   Conclusions: Our results suggest a higher activation state of SFKs-mediated signalling pathways in platelets from obese patients, with a primary involvement of GPVI signalling.

AB Background and aims: Intracranial atherosclerosis (ICAS) is a predictable and preventable condition, but existing evidence concerning its risk factors has not been quantitatively assessed. The aim of this meta-analysis is to identify the non-modifiable and modifiable risk factors for ICAS.
   Methods: PubMed and EMBASE were searched (1995-May 15, 2018) for cross-sectional and longitudinal studies exploring risk factors for ICAS. The risk estimates and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) in multivariate analysis were aggregated using random-effect models.
   Results: Thirty-four studies comprising 59,736 subjects met the inclusion criteria for the systematic review involving thirty-one risk or protective factors. Seven factors were associated with ICAS, as suggested by the meta-analysis, including advanced age (odds ratio (OR) 1.05, 95% CI 1.03-1.08), metabolic syndrome (OR 2.13, 95% CI 1.35-3.37), diabetes mellitus (OR 1.98, 95% CI 1.69-2.31), hypertension (OR 1.97, 95% CI 1.69-2.31), dyslipidemia (OR 1.29, 95% CI 1.04-1.59), high levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (OR 1.06, 95% CI 1.00-1.12) and high levels of apolipoprotein A1 (OR 0.34, 95% CI 0.15-0.75). The subgroup analysis for study populations indicated advanced age, metabolic syndrome, diabetes mellitus and hypertension as an elevated risk of ICAS among community subjects and stroke patients; according to the subgroup analysis for ethnicity, similar associations remained in Asians, but only metabolic syndrome and diabetes mellitus were correlated with ICAS in Caucasians.
   Conclusions: Individuals with advanced age, metabolic syndrome, diabetes mellitus, hypertension and dyslipidemia might have a higher risk of ICAS, whereas high levels of apolipoprotein A1 might protect against ICAS.

AB Background and aims: The neuropeptide catestatin (CST) is an endogenous nicotinic cholinergic antagonist that acts as pleiotropic cardiac protective hormone. This study investigated the association between CST and coronary artery disease (CAD) and the underlying mechanisms.
   Methods and results: The serum concentration of CST among 224 CAD patients and 204 healthy controls was compared, and its association with atherosclerosis severity in 921 CAD patients was further analyzed. Compared to healthy subjects, serum CST concentration was lower in patients with CAD [ 1.14 (1.05-1.24) ng/mL vs. 2.15 (1.92-2.39) ng/mL, p < 0.001] and was inversely correlated with disease severity (r=-0.208, p < 0.001). In cultured endothelial cells, CST suppressed TNF-alpha-elicited expression of inflammatory cytokines and adhesion molecules by activating angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2). Administration of CST reduced leukocyte-endothelium interactions in vitro and in vivo, and attenuated the development of atherosclerotic in ApoE(-/-) mice fed a high-fat diet. These protective effects by CST were blocked by an ACE2 inhibitor.
   Conclusions: Serum CST concentration is lower in CAD patients and is inversely associated with the severity of atherosclerosis. CST acts as a novel anti-atherogenic peptide that inhibits inflammatory response and EC-leukocyte interactions via an ACE2-dependent mechanism.

AB Background and aims: Recent transversal studies have associated insulin-like growth factor binding protein (IGFBP)-2 levels with glucose tolerance and parameters of the lipoprotein-lipid profile. Here, we aimed at determining the longitudinal effects of a one-year lifestyle modification program on IGFBP-2 levels and to identify specific metabolic improvements impacted by the changes in IGFBP-2.
   Methods: 99 middle-aged Caucasian men were involved in a lifestyle modification program consisting in personalized healthy eating and physical activity counseling, combined to elicit a daily 500 kcal deficit. Anthropometric and metabolic parameters as well as circulating IGFBP-2 levels were measured before and after one year of the lifestyle modification program.
   Results: The intervention triggered positive changes in many metabolic parameters and a 43% (p < 0.0001) increase of IGFBP-2 levels. Subjects with the most substantial increases in IGFBP-2 also experienced the most important metabolic improvements. Changes in IGFBP-2 levels (both absolute and relative) were correlated with markers of body fat distribution and lipoprotein-lipid profile, and independently associated with changes in LDL apolipoprotein (apo) B but not VLDL apo B concentrations. Further analyses showed that for similar changes in BMI, waist circumference and visceral adipose tissue volume, large changes in IGFBP-2 levels were required to observe improvements in LDL apo B levels.
   Conclusions: The 1-year lifestyle modification program was associated with increased IGFBP-2 concentrations. Increases in IGFBP-2 levels were closely associated with reduced LDL apo B concentrations and independently of the modifications in fat mass and insulin sensitivity. Further mechanistic studies are required to assess the effects of IGFBP-2 levels on LDL metabolism.

AB Background and aims: We aimed to compare the effectiveness of ticagrelor vs. clopidogrel or prasugrel on recurrence of acute coronary syndromes (ACS) in real-life conditions, as requested by regulatory authorities at the time of marketing.
   Methods: We performed a cohort study in SNDS, the French national healthcare database. All patients with a hospital admission for ACS in 2013 were followed one year. Patients on ticagrelor, clopidogrel or prasugrel were matched 1: 1 using age, gender, index ACS type, and high-dimensional propensity scores (hdPS). Outcomes were ACS, stroke, all-cause death, and major bleeding, compared within matched groups using Cox proportional hazards models analysis during treatment.
   Results: 54,048 ACS were hospitalized in 2013. At discharge, 19,796 were dispensed clopidogrel, 8242 prasugrel, and 13,916 ticagrelor. Per group, 9224 ticagrelor vs. clopidogrel, 6752 ticagrelor vs. prasugrel, and 4676 prasugrel vs. clopidogrel patients were matched. Compared to clopidogrel, ticagrelor was associated with a lower hazard ratio of death 0.73 [0.59-0.90] and composite criterion (0.88, 95% CI [0.79-0.99] but not ACS 0.92 [0.80-1.06], stroke (0.96 [017-5.53]) or major bleeding (1.02 [0.82-1.26]). Prasugrel was not different from ticagrelor or clopidogrel for any outcome, in matched patients.
   Conclusions: Ticagrelor in real-life conditions in matched populations was associated with a lower risk of all-cause death than clopidogrel, and a lower risk of composite outcome, as in the main pivotal clinical trial. Ticagrelor and prasugrel were not different, nor were prasugrel and clopidogrel.

AB Background and aims: Since clinical characteristics and prognosis of patients with multi-vessel vasospastic angina (VSA) are not clear, we investigated the nature and prognosis of multi-vessel VSA in Koreans.
   Methods: Among 2960 patients enrolled in the VA-KOREA (Vasospastic Angina in Korea) registry, 104 definite multi-vessel VSA patients, 163 single vessel VSA patients and 737 non-VSA patients were identified using the intracoronary ergonovine provocation test.
   Results: Multi-vessel VSA and single vessel VSA groups showed similar baseline characteristics and medical treatment on discharge, but different from the non-VSA group. The primary composite endpoint (cardiac death, acute coronary syndrome, and symptomatic new onset arrhythmia) over a 36-month follow-up period was significantly higher in the multi-vessel VSA group than in the single vessel VSA and non-VSA groups (8.7% vs. 1.8% and 1.1%, each log-rank p < 0.05, respectively). The rate of death and acute coronary syndrome of the multi-vessel VSA group was higher than in the single vessel VSA and non-VSA groups (5.8% vs. 1.2% and 0.9%, each log-rank p < 0.05, respectively). In addition, multi-vessel VSA was an independent predictor of the primary composite endpoint at 36 months (HR 8.5, 95% CI [2.6-27.2], p < 0.0001).
   Conclusions: Patients with multi-vessel VSA had worse clinical outcomes than single vessel VSA and non-VSA groups, suggesting that the existence of multi-vessel VSA itself is highly prognostic.

AB Background and aims: Constipation is one of the most frequent symptoms encountered in daily clinical practice and is implicated in the development of atherosclerosis, potentially through altered gut microbiota. However, little is known about its association with incident cardiovascular events.
   Methods: In a nationally representative cohort of 3,359,653 US veterans with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) >= 60 mL/min/1.73 m(2) between October 1, 2004 and September 30, 2006 (baseline period), with follow-up through 2013, we examined the association of constipation status (absence or presence; defined using diagnostic codes and laxative use) and laxative use (none, one, or >= 2 types of laxatives) with all-cause mortality, incident coronary heart disease (CHD), and incident ischemic stroke.
   Results: Among 3,359,653 patients, 237,855 (7.1%) were identified as having constipation. After multivariable adjustments for demographics, prevalent comorbidities, medications, and socioeconomic status, patients with (versus without) constipation had 12% higher all-cause mortality (hazard ratio [HR], 1.12; 95% CI, 1.11-1.13), 11% higher incidence of CHD (HR, 1.11; 95% CI, 1.08-1.14), and 19% higher incidence of ischemic stroke (HR, 1.19; 95% CI, 1.15-1.22). Patients with one and >= 2 (versus none) types of laxatives experienced a similarly higher risk of all-cause mortality (HRs [95% CI], 1.15 [1.13-1.16] and 1.14 [1.12-1.15], respectively), incident CHD (HRs [95% CI], 1.11 [1.07-1.15] and 1.10 [1.05-1.15], respectively) and incident ischemic stroke (HRs [95% CI], 1.19 [1.14-1.23] and 1.21 [1.16-1.26], respectively).
   Conclusions: Constipation status and laxative use are independently associated with higher risk of all-cause mortality and incident CHD and ischemic stroke.

DE Epidemiology; Cohort study; Total cholesterol; LDL cholesterol
ID SERUM-CHOLESTEROL LEVELS; SEASONAL-VARIATION; GUIDELINES
AB Background and aims: We aimed to test the hypothesis that levels of total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol are increased after Christmas and that the risk of hypercholesterolemia is increased after the Christmas holidays.
   Methods: We conducted an observational study of 25,764 individuals from the Copenhagen General Population Study, Denmark, aged 20-100 years. Main outcome measures were mean total and LDL cholesterol levels. Hypercholesterolemia was defined as total cholesterol > 5 mmol/L (> 193 mg/dL) or LDL-cholesterol > 3 mmol/L (> 116 mg/dL).
   Results: Mean levels of total and LDL cholesterol increased in individuals examined in summer through December and January. Compared with individuals examined in May-June, those examined in December-January had 15% higher total cholesterol levels (p < 0.001). The corresponding value for LDL cholesterol was 20% (p < 0.001). Of the individuals attending the study during the first week of January, immediately after the Christmas holidays, 77% had LDL cholesterol above 3 mmol/L (116 mg/dL) and 89% had total cholesterol above 5 mmol/L (193 mg/dL). In individuals attending the Copenhagen General Population Study in the first week of January, the multivariable adjusted odds ratio of hypercholesterolemia was 6.0 (95% confidence interval 4.2-8.5) compared with individuals attending the study during the rest of the year.
   Conclusions: Celebrating Christmas is associated with higher levels of total and LDL cholesterol and a higher risk of hypercholesterolemia in individuals in the general population. Thus, a diagnosis of hypercholesterolemia should not be made around Christmas, and our results stress the need for re-testing such patients later and certainly prior to initiation of cholesterol-lowering treatment.

AB Background and aims: Growth differentiation factor-15 (GDF-15)/macrophage inhibitory cytokine-1 (MIC-1/GDF15) is associated with cardiovascular disease, inflammation and development of atherosclerosis and is highly expressed in macrophages (M Phi) of atherosclerotic lesions. Thus, we were interested in investigating the influence of GDF-15 in lipid homeostasis and autophagy in human MF during foam cell formation.
   Methods and results: Oxidized-low density lipoprotein (50 mu g/ml oxLDL), recombinant (r)GDF-15, transiently silenced GDF-15 (siGDF-15 M Phi), as well as with negative siRNA transfected (nsiGDF-15 M Phi) PMA-differentiated human THP-1 M Phi, were used to investigate the effects of GDF-15 on autophagic processes and lipid accumulation. Oil Red O staining revealed that rGDF-15 alone, but also in combination with oxLDL, significantly increased the lipid accumulation in THP-1 M Phi; a reverse effect was detected in siGDF-15 M Phi. Western-blot analyses and confocal laser scanning microscopy showed an increase of Atg5, Atg12/Atg5 protein complex and p62 protein in THP-1 M Phi co-incubated with rGDF-15 and oxLDL, as well as an increase of p62 accumulation compared to rGDF-15-treated MF. Vice versa, siGDF-15 M Phi showed a reduced p62 accumulation compared to nsiGDF-15 M Phi. The present study indicates that GDF-15, especially in combination with oxLDL, regulates the expression of autophagy-relevant proteins (p62, Atg5 and Atg12/Atg5 protein complex) and p62 accumulation in human M Phi.
   Conclusions: GDF-15, in combination with oxLDL, impairs autophagic processes with consequences for lipid homeostasis in human M Phi, indicating its novel important pathophysiological role in atherosclerotic plaque development and progression.

TI Differential use of E2 ubiquitin conjugating enzymes for regulated

   LIGASES; GP78; UBC6
AB Background and aims: Cholesterol is an essential lipid for cellular function and membrane integrity, and hence its cellular levels and distribution must be tightly regulated. Biosynthesis of cholesterol is ramped when its cellular levels are low. Herein, the ER-resident and rate-limiting enzymes 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (HMGCR) and squalene monooxygenase (SQLE) play a prominent role. We have recently reported that MARCH6, an E3 ubiquitin ligase, specifically promotes cholesterol-stimulated ubiquitylation and subsequent proteasomal degradation of SQLE, but not of HMGCR. To further delineate how post-translational regulation of SQLE and HMGCR is differentially achieved, we hypothesized that their sterol-dependent degradation machinery makes use of distinct E2 ubiquitin conjugating enzymes.
   Methods: To study this possibility, we therefore used a CRISPR/Cas9-based approach to screen for ER-associated degradation (ERAD)-associated E2 enzymes that are essential for MARCH6-dependent degradation of SQLE.
   Results: We report here the identification of UBE2J2 as the primary E2 ubiquitin conjugating enzyme essential for this process in mammalian cells, in contrast to UBE2G2, which is essential for sterol-stimulated degradation of HMGCR. We demonstrate that ablating UBE2J2 disturbs cholesterol-accelerated SQLE degradation in multiple human cell types, including cells of hepatic origin, and that the ability of UBE2J2 to support SQLE degradation critically depends on its enzymatic activity.
   Conclusions: Our findings establish UBE2J2 as an important partner of MARCH6 in cholesterol-stimulated degradation of SQLE, thereby contributing to the complex regulation of cellular cholesterol homeostasis.

AB Albeit a consistent body of evidence supports the notion that genes influence cardiometabolic features and outcomes, the "non-genetic regulation" of this process is gaining increasing attention. Plastic chemical changes of DNA/histone complexes - known as epigenetic changes - critically determine gene activity by rapidly modifying chromatin accessibility to transcription factors. In this review, we describe the emerging role of chromatin modifications as fine tuners of gene transcription in adipogenesis, insulin resistance, macrophage polarization, immuno-metabolism, endothelial dysfunction and metabolic cardiomyopathy. Epigenetic processing participates in the dynamic interplay among different organs in the cardiometabolic patient. DNA methylation and post-translational histone modifications in both visceral and subcutaneous adipose tissue enable the transcription of genes implicated in lipo-and adipogenesis, inflammation and insulin resistance. Along the same line, complex networks of chromatin modifying enzymes are responsible for impaired nitric oxide bioavailability and defective insulin signalling in the vasculature, thus leading to reduced capillary recruitment and insulin delivery in the liver, skeletal muscle and adipose tissue. Furthermore, changes in methylation status of IL-4, IFN gamma and Forkhead box P3 (Foxp3) gene loci are crucial for the polarization of immune cells, thus leading to adipose tissue inflammation and atherosclerosis. Cell-specific epigenetic information could advance our understanding of cardiometabolic processes, thus leading to individualized risk assessment and personalized therapeutic approaches in patients with cardiometabolic disturbances. The development of new chromatin modifying drugs indicates that targeting epigenetic changes is a promising approach to reduce the burden of cardiovascular disease in this setting.

AB Macrophages are key players in immunity and tissue homeostasis but can also contribute to a diverse range of human diseases, including cardiovascular diseases. Enhancers, cis-acting DNA elements regulating gene activity, have been shown to be crucial for control of macrophage development and function. The selection and activities of macrophage-specific enhancers are regulated by the combined actions of lineage determining transcription factors (LDTFs) and signal dependent transcription factors (SDTFs) that are specified by developmental origin and tissue-specific signals. As a consequence, each tissue resident macrophage population adopts a distinct phenotype. In this review, we discuss recent work on how environmental factors affect the activation status of enhancers and can lead to long-lasting epigenetic changes resulting in innate immune memory. Furthermore, we discuss how non-coding genetic variation affects gene expression by altering transcription factor binding through local and domain-wide mechanisms. These findings have implications for interpretation of non-coding risk alleles that are associated with human disease and efforts to target macrophages for therapeutic purposes.

AB Underlying mechanisms of cardiovascular diseases (CVD) have been investigated for over 100 years and novel molecular level mechanisms in the pathophysiology are still continuously being discovered. Genetic polymorphisms (SNPs = single nucleotide polymorphisms) have explained about one tenth of the CVD risk, but polymorphisms fail to account for gene-environment interactions i.e. explain the dynamics of epigenome modifications in CVD. Accumulating evidence suggests that epigenetic modifications are actively reshaping pathological processes (e.g. dedifferentiation of smooth muscle cells, accumulation of senescent cells) in CVD. Senescence of vascular cells in ageing arteries not only counteracts regenerative processes but also exacerbates atherogenesis. Epigenome modifications include changes in DNA methylation, histone code and expression of non-coding RNAs. DNA methylation is a major epigenetic regulator modulating cell-type specific gene expression in mural cells, but there is some controversy regarding how to interpret the role of DNA hyper- and hypomethylation in CVD pathology. DNA hypomethylation (loss of methyl cytosines) appears to predominate in atherosclerosis, while a few genes become more methylated (i.e. hypermethylated) as the disease progresses in medium-sized and large arteries. The actual time-course of atherosclerosis-linked changes in genomic DNA methylation is still poorly studied. This review highlights recent novel findings which link alterations in DNA methylation to atherogenesis and points out new potential approaches for novel treatments.

AB Long intergenic noncoding RNAs (lincRNAs) are increasingly recognized as important mediators of many biological processes relevant to human pathophysiologies, including cardiovascular diseases. In vitro studies have provided important knowledge of cellular functions and mechanisms for an increasing number of lincRNAs. Dysregulated lncRNAs have been associated with cell fate programming and development, vascular diseases, atherosclerosis, dyslipidemia and metabolic syndrome, and cardiac pathological hypertrophy. However, functional interrogation of individual lincRNAs in physiological and disease states is largely limited. The complex nature of lincRNA actions and poor species conservation of human lincRNAs pose substantial challenges to physiological studies in animal model systems and in clinical translation. This review summarizes recent findings of specific lincRNA physiological studies, including MALAT1, MeXis, Lnc-DC and others, in the context of cardiovascular diseases, examines complex mechanisms of lincRNA actions, reviews in vivo research strategies to delineate lincRNA functions and highlights challenges and approaches for physiological studies of primate-specific lincRNAs.

AB Notwithstanding the intense efforts into the understanding and prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD), its complex pathology remains the leading cause of mortality worldwide. The pivotal role of epigenetic changes in the control of gene expression has been profiled in several diseases, such as cancer and inflammatory disorders. In the last decade, increasing evidence has also linked aberrant epigenetic modulation as a contributor to CVD development. Differential profiles of DNA methylation, histone methylation and acetylation have consistently been observed in tissues and cells (comprising the aortic lesions, vascular endothelium and monocytes) from patients with CVD. This highlights the therapeutic potential of epigenetic drugs for cardiovascular treatment.

AB Background and aims: Fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) plays an important role in glucose and lipid metabolism. We have investigated the relationship of plasma FGF21 levels with both prevalent and incident metabolic syndrome (MetS) in participants from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA).
   Methods: 5783 participants from four major ethnic groups (non-Hispanic white, African American, Hispanic American, and Chinese American) were included in the cross-sectional analysis. Longitudinal analysis involved 3479 participants without MetS at baseline, of whom 1100 participants developed incident MetS over 9.2 years.
   Results: Elevated FGF21 levels were found in participants with prevalent MetS (median [interquartile range] = 189.4 [114.4-302.1] vs. 123.7 [65.9-210.3] pg/mL, p < 0.001) or incident MetS (145.6 [84.9-240.8] vs 112.0 [57.0-194.5] pg/mL, p < 0.001), compared to those without. After adjusting for baseline demographic, socioeconomic and lifestyle factors, as well as cardiovascular risk factors and biomarkers, and compared to the lowest quartile, the highest FGF21 quartile was associated with prevalent MetS (odds ratio 2.80; 95% confidence interval, 2.30-3.40, p < 0.001). Among participants without MetS at baseline, the highest FGF21 quartile was associated with higher risk of incident MetS (hazards ratio 1.76; 95% confidence interval, 1.46-2.12, p < 0.001). Similar results were obtained when assessing ln-transformed FGF21 levels. Overall, no significant interaction was found with age, sex, and race/ethnicity for both prevalent and incident MetS.
   Conclusions: Higher FGF21 levels significantly predict the development of MetS in an ethnically diverse population followed long term. Further studies are needed to confirm the potential role of FGF21 as a biomarker for MetS.

AB Background and aims: The International Atherosclerosis Society (IAS) has proposed that patients with "severe" FH (SFH) would warrant early and more aggressive cholesterol-lowering treatment such as with PCSK9 inhibitors. SFH is diagnosed if LDL-cholesterol (LDLC) > 10 mmol/L, or LDLC > 8.0 mmol/L plus one high-risk feature, or LDLC > 5 mmol/L plus two high-risk features. Here we compare CHD mortality in SFH and non-SFH (NSFH) patients in the UK prospective Simon Broome Register since 1991, when statin use became routine.
   Methods: 2929 definite or possible PFH patients (51% women) aged 20-79 years were recruited from 21 UK lipid clinics and followed prospectively between 1992 and 2016. The excess CHD standardised mortality ratio (SMR) compared to the England and Wales population was calculated (with 95% confidence intervals).
   Results: 1982 (67.7%) patients met the SFH definition. Compared to the non-SFH, significantly (p < 0.001) more SFH patients had diagnosed CHD at baseline (24.6% vs. 17.5%), were current smokers (21.9% vs 10.2%) and had a BMI > 30 kg/m(2) (14.9% vs. 7.8%). The SMR for CHD mortality was significantly (p = 0.007) higher for SFH (220 (184-261) (34,134 person years, 129 deaths observed, vs. 59 expected) compared to NSFH of 144 (98-203) (15,432 person years, 32 observed vs. 22 expected). After adjustment for traditional risk factors, the Hazard Ratio for CHD mortality in SFH vs. NSFH was 1.22 (0.80-1.87) p = 0.36, indicating that the excess risk was largely accounted for by these factors.
   Conclusions: CHD mortality remains elevated in treated FH, especially for SFH, emphasising the importance of optimal lipid-lowering and management of other risk factors.

AB Background and aims: Familial combined hyperlipidemia (FCHL) is a complex dyslipidemia associated with premature cardiovascular disease (CVD). The present study was conducted to 1) determine the incidence of CVD in FCHL in this era of protocolled, primary prevention; and 2) examine whether cardiovascular risk estimation based on the Systemic Coronary Risk Estimation (SCORE) chart, as proposed in the 2016 ESC/EAS guidelines for the management of dyslipidemia, is justified in FCHL.
   Methods: FCHL patients, their normolipidemic (NL) relatives and spouses originally included in our baseline cohort in 1998-2005 (n = 596) were invited for a follow-up visit to determine the incidence of CVD, defined as (non-) fatal coronary artery disease, ischemic stroke and peripheral artery disease requiring invasive treatment.
   Results: Follow-up data (median: 15 years) was acquired for 85% of the original cohort. The cumulative incidence of CVD was significantly higher in FCHL patients than in spouses (23.6% versus 4.7%; hazard ratio (HR): 5.4, 95% CI: 2.0-14.6; HR after adjustment for risk factors included in SCORE: 4.7, 95% CI: 1.6-13.8), but not in NL relatives compared to spouses (5.8% versus 4.7%). The SCORE chart tended to overestimate CVD risk in the spouses (observed [O]/expected [E] ratio: 0.2, p = 0.01), but not in FCHL patients (O/E: 1.3, p = 0.50).
   Conclusions: Risk of primary CVD is still substantially increased in FCHL patients, despite preventive measures. The overestimation of CVD risk by the SCORE chart -a nowadays frequently observed phenomenon thanks to improved primary prevention - was not seen in FCHL. These results suggest that more aggressive treatment is justified to avoid excessive CVD in FCHL.

AB Background and aims: Serum paraoxonase 1 (PON1) and myeloperoxidase (MPO) are HDL-associated enzymes that contribute significantly to the formation of dysfunctional HDL. The present study thus seeks to comparatively analyze the predictive role of PON1, MPO and the MPO/PON1 ratio and to also evaluate which one has a stronger predictive role in their combined utility as an MPO/PON1 ratio in coronary artery disease (CAD).
   Methods: PON1 activity and MPO concentrations were determined in patients with established CAD and those without significant CAD. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were drawn by plotting true positivity versus false positivity.
   Results: The ROC curve analyses showed that PON1 (AUC=61%, p=0.003) and MPO/PON1 (AUC=60%, p=0.01) have a better diagnostic performance than MPO (AUC=50%, p=0.42) in detecting patients with CAD. PON1 and MPO/PON1 were found to have a significantly stronger discriminatory power for the age range >= 52 and < 60 years (AUC=69%, p=0.008 for PON1; AUC=66%, p=0.022 for MPO/PON1). The multivariate analysis revealed PON1 as an independent variable that was significantly associated with the multi-vessel disease [odds ratio (OR)=0.98; p=0.017]. At the cutoff point of 30 mu mol/mL/min for PON1 and 1.85 for MPO/PON1, specificities were 97% and 73% and sensitivities 30% and 54% for discriminating patients with single-vessel disease from non-CAD subjects.
   Conclusions: The diagnostic performance of PON1 alone was comparable to that of the MPO/PON1 ratio for CAD risk assessment; however, MPO may increase the true positive rate. A larger number of blocked vessels seems to be associated with an increased predictive power for both PON1 and MPO/PON1. Recent data support the fact that PON1 and MPO may potentially be appropriate therapeutic targets for preventing CAD.

AB Background and aims: Dyslipidemia in type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) is characterised by altered distributions of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) subclasses. Recent studies suggested that proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin 9 (PCSK9) may contribute to the development of dyslipidemia in T1DM. In this cross-sectional study, we investigated the association between PCSK9 and lipoprotein subclasses in young T1DM patients, with respect to glycemic control.
   Methods: Plasma PCSK9 and lipoprotein subclasses were determined in 207 patients with T1DM (106 boys and 101 girls), aged 13.9 +/- 3.0 years and treated by intensive insulin therapy.
   Results: Plasma PCSK9 levels significantly increased with worsening of glycemic control (p < 0.001). T1DM patients with poor glucoregulation had the highest proportion of small, dense LDL (sdLDL) and smaller HDL particles, as well. PCSK9 was positively associated with markers of glucose homeostasis and serum lipid parameters only in patients with suboptimal/poor glucoregulation. In well-controlled T1DM, plasma PCSK9 level was inversely associated with a relative proportion of sdLDL particles (p < 0.01) and this association remained significant in multivariate analysis. In T1DM patients with suboptimal/poor glycemic control, PCSK9 was positively associated with the proportion of the smallest HDL3c particles (p < 0.001), but negatively with HDL size (p < 0.05).
   Conclusions: The extent of achieved metabolic control modifies the association between PCSK9 and lipoprotein subclasses in T1DM. Further investigations are needed to reveal whether the observed effects of glycemic control on PCSK9 and sdLDL levels have causal consequences on CVD risk in young patients with T1DM.

AB Background and aims: In this analysis, we estimated population-level trajectory groups of life course cardiovascular risk to explore their impact on mid-life atherosclerotic and metabolic outcomes.
   Methods: This prospective study followed n = 1269 Bogalusa Heart participants, each with at least 4 study visits from childhood in 1973 through adulthood in 2016. We used discrete mixture modeling to determine trajectories of cardiovascular risk percentiles from childhood to adulthood. Outcomes included mid-life subclinical atherosclerotic measures [(carotid intima-media thickness (cIMT), pulse wave velocity (PWV)], metabolic indicators [(diabetes and body mass index (BMI)], and short physical performance battery (SPPB).
   Results: Between the mean ages of 9.6-48.3 years, we estimated five distinct trajectory groups of life course cardiovascular risk (High-Low, High-High, Mid-Low, Low-Low, and Low-High). Adult metabolic and vascular outcomes were significantly determined by life course cardiovascular risk trajectory groups (all p < 0.01). Those in the High-Low group had lower risks of diabetes (20% vs. 28%, respectively; p=.12) and lower BMIs (32.4 kg/m(2) vs. 34.6 kg/m(2); p=.06) than those who remained at high risk (High-High) throughout life. However, the High-Low group had better cIMT (0.89mm vs. 1.05 mm; p<.0001) and PWV (7.8 m/s vs. 8.2 m/s; p=.03) than the High-High group. For all outcomes, those in the Low-Low group fared best.
   Conclusions: We found considerable movement between low-and high-relative cardiovascular risk strata over the life course. Children who improved their relative cardiovascular risk over the life course achieved better midlife atherosclerotic health despite maintaining relatively poor metabolic health through adulthood.

AB Background and aims: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is strongly associated with a high burden of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Therefore, we aimed to characterize the putative role of microRNAs (miR) s in uremic vascular remodelling and endothelial dysfunction.
   Methods: We investigated the expression pattern of miRs in two independent end-stage renal disease (ESRD) cohorts and in the animal model of uremic DBA/2 mice via quantitative RT-PCR. Moreover, DBA/2 mice were treated with intravenous injections of synthetic miR-142-3p mimic and were analysed for functional and morphological vascular changes by mass spectrometry and wire myography.
   Results: The expression pattern of miRs was regulated in ESRD patients and was reversible after kidney transplantation. Out of tested miRs, only blood miR-142-3p was negatively associated with carotid-femoral pulsewave velocity in CKD 5D patients. We validated these findings in a murine uremic model and found similar suppression of miR-142-3p as well as decreased acetylcholine-mediated vascular relaxation of the aorta. Therefore, we designed experiments to restore bioavailability of aortic miR-142-3p in vivo via intravenous injection of synthetic miR-142-3p mimic. This intervention restored acetylcholine-mediated vascular relaxation.
   Conclusions: Taken together, we provide compelling evidence, both in humans and in mice, that miR-142-3p constitutes a potential pharmacological agent to prevent endothelial dysfunction and increased arterial stiffness in ESRD.

AB Background and aims: Considerable attention is given nowadays to the presence of cardiovascular diseases risk factors in children. The current blood lipid classification system for Chinese children was based on the United States National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) cutpoints, which did not take the age, gender and race differences into consideration. This study aimed to develop gender-and age-specific lipid cutpoints for dyslipidemia screening in Chinese children and compare the ability of new cutpoints and NCEP pediatric cutpoints to predict obesity and unfavorable blood pressure (BP) levels.
   Methods: Data were obtained from a nationwide multicenter cross-sectional study: The China Child and Adolescent Cardiovascular Health Study, comprising 12,875 Chinese children aged 6-18 years. We calculated cutpoints for abnormal levels of total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), and triglycerides (TG) that were linked to Chinese adult abnormal lipid thresholds using the General Additive Model for Location Scale and Shape method.
   Results: Borderline-high and high cutpoints (TC, LDL-C and TG) as well as low cutpoints (HDL-C) were developed to classify the abnormal blood lipid levels in Chinese children. Better performance for prediction of obesity, elevated BP, and hypertension were found with the proposed cutpoints in comparison with the NCEP pediatric cutpoints (AUC for obesity: 0.612 vs. 0.597, p=0.017; AUC for elevated BP: 0.529 vs. 0.521, p=0.017; AUC for hypertension: 0.536 vs. 0.527, p=0.016).
   Conclusions: The gender-and age-specific cutpoints should improve the accuracy of dyslipidemia screening in China and be more reasonable in practice.

AB Background and aims: Although there is substantial evidence that serum gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) is associated with cerebrovascular diseases, its role in silent brain infarcts (SBIs) has not been addressed. In this study, we evaluated the relationship between serum GGT and the presence of SBI in a neurologically healthy population.
   Methods: We evaluated a consecutive series of healthy volunteers recruited between January 2006 and December 2013. We conducted broad examinations in the form of health check-ups, which included brain magnetic resonance imaging and laboratory examinations including assessment of GGT levels. SBI was defined as asymptomatic, well-defined lesions with a dimeter of >3mm with the same signal characteristics as cerebrospinal fluid on T1-or T2-weighted images.
   Results: A total of 3145 healthy subjects were assessed, and 260 SBI cases were identified. In multivariate analysis, the highest GGT tertile was independently associated with SBI [adjusted OR (aOR) = 1.48, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.02 to 2.15, p = 0.040] in a dose-response manner (p for trend = 0.037). Age and hypertension were also found to be significant factors for SBI. In a stratified analysis by sex, these positive associations of GGT levels with SBI became more prominent in the male group (aOR = 2.14, 95% CI = 1.15 to 4.00, p = 0.017), with a significantly increasing trend (p for trend = 0.028), while there was no association among female participants.
   Conclusions: Increased serum GGT levels were found to be associated with higher SBI prevalence in a neurologically healthy population.

AB Background and aims: Despite hypercholesterolemia has been recognized to increase cardiovascular risk in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients, cholesterol-lowering therapy is underused in this population, due to fear of drug-drug interactions with antiretroviral therapy (ART). We investigated the effects of a nutraceutical combination (NC) on lipid profile, proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9), subclinical inflammation and arterial stiffness in ART-treated HIV-infected patients.
   Methods: This was a prospective randomized open-label trial with a cross-over design including 30 stable HIV-infected patients on ART with low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C)>115 mg/dL, not taking lipid-lowering treatment. After a 3-week lipid stabilization period, the effects associated with 3 months of an oral NC containing red yeast rice and berberine vs. no active treatment (noNC) were assessed for plasma total cholesterol (TC), LDL-C, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), triglyceride (TG), lipoprotein(a), PCSK9, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) levels and aortic pulse wave velocity (aPWV).
   Results: At baseline, significant correlations between PCSK9 levels, age (rho=-0.51, p=0.004), waist circumference (rho=0.36, p=0.005) and CD4+ cell count (rho=-0.40, p=0.027) were observed. NC treatment effects corrected for noNC were significant for TC (-14%, p<0.001), LDL-C (-19%, p<0.001), PCSK9 (-12%, p=0.02), hs-CRP (-14%, p=0.03) and aPWV (-6%, p=0.005). No significant effects were observed for HDL-C, TG and lipoprotein(a). NC treatment was safe and no significant alterations in muscle, liver and immunovirological parameters were observed. No carry over effect was recorded.
   Conclusions: The tested NC significantly reduced plasma cholesterol and PCSK9 levels, attenuated subclinical inflammation and improved arterial stiffness in stable HIV-infected patients on ART.

AB Background and aims: We assessed the predictive role of coronary artery calcification (CAC) in clinically relevant cognitive impairment in 148 middle-aged individuals with childhood-onset type 1 diabetes (T1D) from the Pittsburgh Epidemiology of Diabetes Complications (EDC) Study.
   Methods: Baseline CAC was measured in 1996-98 and repeated 4-8 years later. Per extensive neuropsychological testing in 2010-15, 28% (41/148) of participants met the study definition of clinically relevant cognitive impairment (two or more of 7 select test scores >= 1.5SD worse than demographically appropriate published norms). Logistic regression models with backward selection were constructed for statistical analysis.
   Results: Mean age and T1D duration at first CAC measure were 37 and 29 years, respectively. A greater burden of initial CAC was associated with cognitive impairment determined 14 years later. Compared to Agatston score= 0, odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) of 0<-100, 100<-300 and> 300 were 1.4 (0.6, 3.6), 2.3 (0.6, 9.7), and 7.9 (1.6, 38.5), respectively. With both initial and progression of CAC in the multivariable model, backward selection retained only CAC progression, showing it was significantly associated with cognitive impairment (OR [95% CI]: 1.7 [1.1, 2.9]). In those with an initial CAC> 0, CAC density was marginally, inversely, associated with cognitive impairment when controlling for CAC volume (OR [95% CI]: 0.3 (0.1, 1.2), p value= 0.078).
   Conclusions: Greater CAC burden was associated with clinically relevant cognitive impairment in middle-aged adults with childhood-onset T1D. CAC progression appears to be a more powerful predictor than initial calcification.

AB Background and aims: A small crypt in the Santissima Annunziata Church of Santa Maria della Scala Hospital in Siena (Italy) contained three well-preserved mummies, two of which, dated back to the 15th-16th century, were identified as Salimbene Capacci (1433-1497), Rector of the Hospital, and his wife, Margherita Sozzini (?-1511). The third mummy, dressed in clothes of the 17th century, was not initially identified.
   Methods: Accurate bibliographical, taphonomic and anthropological studies allowed the identification of the mummy of Girolamo Macchi, who lived between 1648 and 1734 and worked as "major writer", an accountant, for the Hospital. He was present when the corpses of the Rector and his wife were discovered in 1678 and, impressed by this finding, wanted to be buried in the same chapel after his death, which occurred at the age of 86. A complete study, including macroscopic, radiological, isotopic and histological analyses, was performed on the natural mummy of Girolamo.
   Results: Macroscopic investigation showed a large inguinoscrotal hernia and a good preservation of the internal organs. The circulatory system revealed severe atherosclerosis, with multiple calcifications stenosing the lumen of the vessels, in particular of the lumbar aorta and the iliac arteries. The diagnosis was confirmed by imaging techniques (3D Cone Beam Scan) and by histology.
   Conclusions: This case confirms that atherosclerosis is also a disease of ancient times. The presence of atherosclerosis in pre-contemporary individuals could suggest that the disease may not only be uniquely characteristic of a specific diet or lifestyle, but it could be also an inherent component of human ageing.

AB Background and aims: Apabetalone is an inhibitor of bromodomain and extraterminal (BET) proteins. In clinical trials, apabetalone reduced the incidence of major adverse cardiac events (MACE) in patients with cardiovascular disease and reduced circulating factors that promote vascular calcification (VC). Because VC contributes to MACE, effects of apabetalone on pro-calcific processes were examined.
   Methods and results: Apabetalone inhibited extracellular calcium deposition and opposed induction of transdifferentiation markers in human coronary artery vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) under osteogenic culture conditions. Tissue-nonspecific alkaline phosphatase (TNAP) is a key contributor to VC, and apabetalone suppressed osteogenic induction of the mRNA, protein and enzyme activity. The liver is a major source of circulating TNAP, and apabetalone also downregulated TNAP expression in primary human hepatocytes. BRD4, a transcriptional regulator and target of apabetalone, has been linked to calcification. Osteogenic transdifferentiation of VSMCs resulted in disassembly of 100 BRD4-rich enhancers, with concomitant enlargement of remaining enhancers. Apabetalone reduced the size of BRD4-rich enhancers, consistent with disrupting BRD4 association with chromatin. 38 genes were uniquely associated with BRD4-rich enhancers in osteogenic conditions; 11 were previously associated with calcification. Apabetalone reduced levels of BRD4 on many of these enhancers, which correlated with decreased expression of the associated gene. Bioinformatics revealed BRD4 may cooperate with 7 specific transcription factors to promote transdifferentiation and calcification.
   Conclusions: Apabetalone counters transdifferentiation and calcification of VSMCs via an epigenetic mechanism involving specific transcription factors. The mechanistic findings, combined with evidence from clinical trials, support further development of apabetalone as a therapeutic for VC.

   ADOLESCENTS
AB Background and aims: Lipid disorders are often detected very late, particularly in affected young children. We evaluated the feasibility of a screening for LDL-hypercholesterolemia (highLDL) among toddlers and preschoolers.
   Methods: Population-based screening has been offered to all children (2-6 years) living in the State of Lower Saxony, Germany, with capillary blood sampling for detection of elevated LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C >= 135 mg/dL). Positive results were confirmed by a second measurement. Follow-up in specialized centers, including disease specific counselling and extended diagnostics, as well as evaluation of psychological distress of the parents, is carried out longitudinally.
   Results: Up to March 2018, 5656 children have participated in the screening program. 5069/5656 children have completed the screening for highLDL (52.0% boys; median age: 4.0 years [Interquartile range, IQR 3.0-5.1]; mother age: 35 years [IQR 31-38]; father's age: 37 years; [IQR 33-42]). HighLDL was identified in 112 children (2.2%; 40.2% boys; LDL-C 157.6 +/- 29.5 mg/dL, mean +/- SD). In the total cohort, parents stated in 40.9% of the cases a positive family history for hyperlipidemia and in 29.9% a premature cardiovascular event. Children with highLDL had more often both risk factors in their family history; however, in 37% of them none of these factors were reported.
   Conclusions: The first results of the screening program showed its feasibility and revealed high prevalence of highLDL in the general population. Furthermore, a large proportion of families of affected children were not aware about their lipid disorders.

AB Background and aims: In the 1960s and 1970s, Finland, mortality due to coronary heart disease (CHD) was over 30% higher among Finns residing in the east of the country compared with those residing in the west. Today, CHD mortality remains 20% higher among eastern Finns. The higher incidence of CHD mortality among eastern Finns has largely been explained by higher risk factor levels. Using a unique longitudinal cohort, we aimed to determine if participants who resided in eastern Finland during childhood had higher CHD risk factors in adulthood and from childhood to adulthood.
   Methods: The study population included 2063 participants of the Cardiovascular Risk in Young Finns Study, born during the period 1962-1977, with risk factor data available from baseline (1980) when participants were aged 3-18 years, and had risk factor data collected again in adulthood (2011) when aged 34-49 years.
   Results: Adult CHD risk factor profile was similar for those who resided in eastern or western Finland in childhood. Over life-course from 1980 to 2011, those subjects with childhood residency in eastern Finland had, on average, higher systolic (p = 0.006) and diastolic (p = 0.0009) blood pressures, total (p = 0.01) and LDLcholesterol (p = 0.01), triglycerides (p = 0.04), apoB (p = 0.02), and serum glucose (p<0.0001) than those who resided in western Finland in childhood.
   Conclusions: Our sample of adult Finns aged 34-49 years had a similar CHD risk factor profile irrespective of whether they resided in eastern or western Finland during their childhood. However, when considering participants risk factor profiles over a 31-year period, those who resided in eastern Finland in childhood were associated with a less favorable CHD risk factor profile than those who resided in western Finland in childhood. The observed differences suggest that future CHD mortality might remain higher in eastern Finland compared with western Finland.

AB Background and aims: It has been well established that ezetimibe blocks cholesterol absorption to prevent the negative effects of a high-fat diet in atherosclerosis. However, the exact mechanism is unknown. Here we use a transgenic zebrafish, which expresses different fluorescent proteins on either endothelial cells or granulocytes and macrophages, to explore the specific mechanism of ezetimibe and its role in reducing atherosclerosis-related hypercholesteremia.
   Methods: Zebrafish larvae were exposed to a control diet, high cholesterol diet (HCD) or a HCD with ezetimibe treatment. Both the control diet and high cholesterol diet were mixed with red or green fluorophore labeled cholesteryl ester to trace lipid distribution. Isobaric tags were used for relative and absolute quantification to examine protein expression profiles of zebrafish larvae in the different treatment groups. To knock down Apo A-II and investigate the role of Apo A-II in the anti-atherosclerotic function of ezetimibe, we used morpholinos to target zebrafish Apoa2 mRNA. To confirm ezetimibe regulatory role on Apo A-II expression, siRNA against HNF4, PPARa, and SREBP1 were transfected into HepG2 cells.
   Results: The results show that ezetimibe increased the expression of Apo A-II but failed to reduce vascular lipid accumulation and macrophage recruitment induced by the HCD diet when Apo A-II was knocked down. Finally, we found that ezetimibe increased the expression of Apo A-II through HNF4 and PPARa transcriptional factors.
   Conclusions: Our data indicates that ezetimibe may not only prevents atherosclerosis by inhibiting cholesterol absorption in the intestine, but also by increasing the expression of Apo A-II in hepatocytes, thereby enhancing reverse cholesterol transport and removing excess cholesterol from the periphery.

AB Background and aims: Heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HeFH) is a common genetic disorder characterized by elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and increased cardiovascular disease risk. Despite multiple LDL-C-lowering therapies, many HeFH patients do not reach LDL-C targets. Mipomersen, an antisense oligonucleotide against apolipoprotein B (apoB), might further lower LDL-C in HeFH patients. We assessed the efficacy and safety of two mipomersen dosing regimens in HeFH patients and explored whether thrice-weekly dosing improves the benefit-risk profile.
   Methods: In this double-blind trial, HeFH patients (LDL-C>160 mg/dL) on maximal tolerated LDL-lowering therapy were randomized to mipomersen 200 mg once weekly (n= 104), mipomersen 70 mg thrice weekly (n= 102), or placebo in matching frequency (n= 103) for 60 weeks. Main outcomes were LDL-C, apoB, and lipoprotein(a) levels after 60 weeks of treatment.
   Results: Mipomersen 200 mg once weekly and mipomersen 70 mg thrice weekly significantly lowered LDL-C compared with placebo by 21.0% and 18.8%, respectively, and apoB by 22.1% and 21.7% (all p < 0.001). Lipoprotein(a) was significantly lowered by 27.7% (p < 0.001) with thrice-weekly dosing. Injection-site reactions and flu-like symptoms led to discontinuation in 21.2% (200 mg), 17.6% (70 mg), and 5.8% (placebo) of participants. Alanine transaminase was elevated (>= 3x upper limit of normal at least once) in 21.2%, 21.6%, and 1.0% of subjects, respectively.
   Conclusions: Mipomersen 200 mg once weekly and 70 mg thrice weekly are effective in lowering apoB-containing lipoproteins in HeFH patients. This is counterbalanced by limited tolerability and increased hepatic transaminase levels in about 21% of patients. The thrice-weekly dosing regimen was associated with lower frequency of flu-like symptoms, which might help avert discontinuation in some patients, but otherwise had no major benefits.

AB Background and aims: Limiting the pro-inflammatory immune response is critical for the treatment of atherosclerosis. Regulatory B cells (Bregs) can modulate the immune response through interleukin-10 (IL-10). Current data regarding Bregs and atherosclerosis is scarce and conflicting.
   Methods: In this study, we investigated the frequency of IL-10(+) B cells during the development of atherosclerosis in low-density lipoprotein receptor-deficient (Ldlr(-/-)) mice and studied the effect of adoptive transfer of IL-10(+) B cells on atherosclerosis.
   Results: We found a very strong inverse correlation between atherosclerosis severity and the frequency of IL-10(+) B cells. This effect was cholesterol-independent and observed in spleen, draining lymph nodes and peritoneal cavity. To directly assess the effects of IL-10(+) B cells on atherosclerosis, we expanded IL-10(+) B cells ex vivo with anti-CD40 and selected pure and viable IL-10-secreting B cells and IL-10-B cells and adoptively transferred them to Ldlr(-/-) mice, respectively. While IL-10(-) B cells were strongly atherogenic compared to control-treated mice, IL-10(+) B cells did not affect lesion size. Adoptive transfer of IL-10(+) B cells strongly reduced circulating leukocyte numbers and inflammatory monocytes. In addition, they decreased CD4(+) T cell activation and increased IL-10(+) CD4(+) T cell numbers. Interestingly, both IL-10(+) and IL-10(-) B cells exacerbated serum cholesterol levels and resulted in fatty livers, which potentially masked the beneficial effects of IL-10(+) B cells on atherosclerosis.
   Conclusions: These findings underscore the strong immune-regulating function of IL-10(+) B cells and provide additional incentives to explore effective strategies that expand IL-10(+) B cells in atherosclerosis.

AB Background and aims: Recent studies have shown that trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD) in different clinical settings, but few studies confirmed the association in a community- based general population.
   Methods: This is a nested case-control study from a prospective cohort design. A total of 86 newly diagnosed CVD cases with a median follow-up period of 4.83 years and 86 matched controls were selected for the present analysis.
   Results: Using the LC-MS/MS assays, we found that new CVD cases had a higher baseline levels of TMAO than controls [ median (inter-quartile): 1.57 (0.79-2.29) mu mol/L v. s 0.68 (0.23-1.40) mu mol/L, p < 0.001]. After multivariable adjustment, individuals with TMAO >= 1.89 mu mol/L (Q4) and 1.05-1.89 mu mol/L (Q3) had odds ratio (OR) for CVD of 2.735 [ 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.328-5.630] and 2.544 (95% CI: 1.251-5.172) with the lowest quartile (< 0.43 mu mol/L) as reference. In addition, comparisons of areas under receiver operator characteristics curves confirmed that a model including TMAO had a better discrimination than one without (0.732 vs. 0.664, p = 0.045).
   Conclusions: In the community-based general population, there was a positive association between TMAO and future risk of CVD. Addition of TMAO improved the prediction of CVD beyond traditional risk factors. We recommend considering TMAO as a potential novel preventive target in the management of low-risk CVD adults.

AB Background and aims: The development of atherosclerosis is tightly regulated by the innate and adaptive immune system. Communication between these two compartments occurs, among others, upon presentation of lipid antigens to the NKT cell population by CD1d-expressing antigen-presenting cells. Recent evidence states that also mast cells express CD1d and can directly communicate with NKT cells. However, no such relationship has been reported in atherosclerosis. Here, we aimed to elucidate in vivo the CD1d-mediated interaction between mast cells and NKT cells upon atherosclerosis progression.
   Methods: We adoptively transferred CD1d(-/-) or control mast cells to mast cell-deficient apoE(-/-)Kit(W-sh/ W-sh) mice and subsequently placed the animals on a Western-type diet for 10 weeks.
   Results: At the end of the Western-type diet period, the aortic root of CD1d(-/-) mast cell-reconstituted mice displayed increased plaque size, with less collagen deposition and higher intraplaque CD4(+) T cells, as compared to control mice. In addition, T cells inside the aortic arch showed higher pro-inflammatory cytokine production in the form of IFN gamma, TNF alpha and IL-17. Finally, T-bet expression was found elevated in both CD4(+) and CD8(+) circulating T cells.
   Conclusions: This study is the first to illustrate that disruption of the CD1d communication pathway between mast cells and NKT cells aggravates atherosclerosis, through a shift towards pro-inflammatory T cell responses. This ability of mast cell action during plaque progression sheds new light on their role in atherosclerosis.

ID DISEASE; ATHEROSCLEROSIS; PROLIFERATION; ANTIBODIES
AB Background and aims: Intracranial stenosis (ICS), the common cause of ischemic stroke worldwide, is associated with a high risk of recurrent stroke. We aimed to investigate the relationship between arterial remodeling and antithyroid peroxidase-antibody (TPO-Ab) level in ICS and the effect of TPO-Ab level on the migration of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs).
   Methods: We analyzed data of mild-to-severe ICS patients with normal thyroid function who underwent highresolution magnetic resonance imaging in our center. Vessel area (VA), lumen area, wall area and plaque size were assessed at the most narrowed lumen (MNL) and reference site, respectively. The remodeling index (RI) was defined as VAMNL/VAreference. Negative remodeling (NR) or non-NR was defined as RI <= 0.95 or > 0.95. A scratch-wound healing assay was also designed to analyze the impact of TPO-Ab level on migration of VSMCs, which were isolated from thoracic aorta segments of Sprague Dawley rats.
   Results: A total of 88 patients were included. Patients with elevated TPO-Ab had smaller VA, wall area, plaque size and RI than those with normal level (p < 0.05). Elevated TPO-Ab was significantly associated with NR after adjusting for demographic and vascular risks (odds ratio 10.629, 95% confidence interval, 1.842-61.327, p = 0.008). The rate of VSMCs migration was significantly increased after culture with TPO-Ab (TPO-Ab 1 mu g/ml vs. Mock, 29.8% vs. 12.0%, p < 0.01).
   Conclusions: Elevated TPO-Ab in ICS patients was related to NR. TPO-Ab could promote VSMCs migration, which might be involved in the NR of intracranial artery.

AB Background and aims: The risk of stroke in epileptic patients and the impact of epilepsy history on stroke patients' outcome have not been studied completely. Our purpose is to evaluate whether patients with epilepsy have increased risk of stroke or post-stroke mortality.
   Methods: In Study I, we conducted a retrospective cohort study of 6746 patients with newly diagnosed epilepsy and 26,984 persons without epilepsy between 2000 and 2008, in the database of National Health Insurance in Taiwan. The incidences and risks of stroke during the follow-up period were compared between cohorts until the end of 2013. In Study II, we conducted a nested cohort study of 484,990 hospitalized patients with newly diagnosed stroke between 2000 and 2009. We compared the short-term mortality and complications during stroke admission between stroke patients with previous epilepsy and those without epilepsy.
   Results: The epileptic cohort had an increased stroke risk (hazard ratio [HR] 2.24, 95% CI 2.02 to 2.49). The relationship between epilepsy and stroke risk remains significant in every age group and both sexes. Among hospitalized stroke patients, history of epilepsy was associated with complications, including pneumonia (odds ratio [OR] 1.08, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.18), urinary tract infection (OR 1.16, 95% CI 1.08 to 1.26), and longer stay (p < 0.0001) during the index stroke admission.
   Conclusions: Epileptic patients face increased stroke risk and adverse outcomes of stroke admission. It is necessary to develop a prevention strategy for stroke in epileptic patients.

AB Background and aims: Aortic valve calcification (AVC) may be associated with atherogenic processes arising from endothelial dysfunction (ED). Limited data is available about the relationship between ED, defined by flow mediated dilation (FMD%) and biomarkers, and the prevalence and progression of AVC in a multiethnic population.
   Methods: A sample of 3475 individuals from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA), with both initial and repeat CT scans at a mean of 2.65 +/- 0.84 years and FMD% and serologic markers of ED [C-reactive protein (CRP), Von Willebrand factor (vWF), Plasminogen Activator Inhibitor (PAI), fibrinogen, Interleukin 6 (IL6), E-selectin and ICAM-1 (Intercellular Adhesion Molecule 1)], were analyzed. Multivariate modeling evaluated the association between ED and the prevalent AVC and AVC progression.
   Results: The median levels of FMD% was lower and vWF%, fibrinogen, IL6 and ICAM-1 were significantly higher in the AVC prevalence group versus no AVC prevalence (all p < 0.001). In the fully adjusted model for established risk factors, decreasing FMD% or increasing biomarkers was not independently associated with AVC prevalence [OR FMD% 1.028 (0.786, 1.346), CRP 0.981 (0.825, 1.168), vWF 1.132 (0.559, 2.292), PAI 1.124 (0.960, 1.316), fibrinogen 1.116 (0.424, 2.940), IL6 1.065 (0.779, 1.456), E-selectin 0.876 (0.479, 1.602) and ICAM-1 1.766 (0.834, 3.743)]. In the AVC progression group, FMD%, vWF%, fibrinogen and IL6 were significantly different (p < 0.05). After adjusting for cardiac risk factors, AVC progression was not independently associated with decreasing FMD% or increasing biomarkers [OR FMD% 1.105 (0.835, 1.463), CRP 1.014 (0.849, 1.210), vWF% 1.132 (0.559, 2.292), PAI 1.124 (0.960, 1.316), fibrinogen 0.909 (0.338, 2.443), IL6 1.061 (0.772, 1.459), E-selectin 0.794 (0.426, 1.480) and ICAM-1 0.998 (0.476, 2.092)].
   Conclusions: Endothelial dysfunction by FMD% and biomarkers is not significantly associated with the prevalence or progression of aortic valve calcification after adjustment for cardiac risk factors.

AB Background and aims: We compared the clinical impact of renin-angiotensin system inhibitors (RASI) on longterm clinical outcomes between ST-segment elevation (STEMI) and non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) after successful percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with drug eluting stents (DES) because of the paucity of published data.
   Methods: A total of 24,960 acute myocardial infarction (AMI) patients who underwent PCI with DES and were prescribed the RASI were enrolled and divided into two groups, the STEMI group (n= 14,061) and the NSTEMI group (n= 10,899). The clinical endpoint was the occurrence of major adverse cardiac events (MACE) defined as all-cause death, cardiac death (CD), recurrent myocardial infarction (re-MI), total coronary revascularization (target lesion revascularization [TLR], target vessel revascularization [TVR], non-TVR) during 2 years.
   Results: After propensity score-matched (PSM) analysis, two PSM groups (6762 pairs, n= 13,524, C-statistic= 0.682) were generated. All-cause death (hazard ratio [HR], 1.386; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.114-1.725; p= 0.003) and CD (HR, 1.358; 95% CI, 1.041-1.770; p= 0.024) rates were significantly higher in NSTEMI patients. However, the incidence of MACE, re-MI, total revascularization, TLR, TVR, non-TVR was not significantly different between the two groups. In addition, old age (>= 65years), decreased left ventricular ejection fraction (< 50%), hypertension, creatine kinase isoenzyme level, cardiogenic shock, cardiopulmonary resuscitation on admission, and PCI within 24 h were common significant independent risk factors of all-cause death and CD.
   Conclusions: The mortality reduction capability of RASI was more prominent in the STEMI patients compared with the NSTEMI patients.

AB Background and aims: Clinical practice guidelines recommend specific statin doses for the primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease. Little is known about how statin utilization and dosing have evolved over time in Hong Kong. The aim of this study was to describe trends in statin prevalence, initiation, and dosing from 2004 to 2015.
   Methods: Patients receiving public health services, who were prescribed a statin, were included if they received a lipid test at a single center (n=58,672). Using the territory-wide electronic health record, prescribed daily statin dose, nondaily dose frequency, and statin dose intensity were determined for statin prescriptions from 2004 to 2015. Statin prescription prevalence and initiation rates were estimated using the appropriate at-risk population in the hospital catchment area as the denominator. Prescribed daily doses were stratified by primary or secondary cardiovascular prevention status to assess changes in statin dosing over time.
   Results: The prescription prevalence of statins was higher in 2015 (8.68%; 95% CI, 8.60%-8.75%) as compared with 2004 (1.82%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.78%-1.86%). Initiation rates for new statin users increased from 2004 to 2013. High-intensity statins were infrequently prescribed. New users generally had higher statin initiation rates for primary prevention. There were small increases in the prescribed daily doses of statins. Nondaily statin dosing was infrequent (0.42% of all prescriptions).
   Conclusions: The prevalence and initiation of statin prescriptions increased in Hong Kong, and was in part driven by low-intensity statins for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease.

   IDENTITY
AB Background and aims: Atherosclerosis is a widespread and complicated disease involving phenotypic modulation and transdifferentiation of vascular smooth muscle cells (SMCs), the predominant cells in aorta, as well as changes in endothelial cells and infiltrating monocytes. Alterations in DNA methylation are likely to play central roles in these phenotypic changes, just as they do in normal differentiation and cancer.
   Methods: We examined genome-wide DNA methylation changes in atherosclerotic aorta using more stringent criteria for differentially methylated regions (DMRs) than in previous studies and compared these DMRs to tissue-specific epigenetic features.
   Results: We found that disease-linked hypermethylated DMRs account for 85% of the total atherosclerosis-associated DMRs and often overlap aorta-associated enhancer chromatin. These hypermethylated DMRs were associated with functionally different sets of genes compared to atherosclerosis-linked hypomethylated DMRs. The extent and nature of the DMRs could not be explained as direct effects of monocyte/ macrophage infiltration. Among the known atherosclerosis-and contractile SMC-related genes that exhibited hypermethylated DMRs at aorta enhancer chromatin were ACTA2 (aorta alpha 2 smooth muscle actin), ELN (elastin), MYOCD (myocardin), C9orf3 (miR-23b and miR-27b host gene), and MYH11 (smooth muscle myosin). Our analyses also suggest a role in atherosclerosis for developmental transcription factor genes having little or no previous association with atherosclerosis, such as NR2F2 (COUP-TFII) and TBX18.
   Conclusions: We provide evidence for atherosclerosis-linked DNA methylation changes in aorta SMCs that might help minimize or reverse the standard contractile character of many of these cells by down-modulating aorta SMC-related enhancers, thereby facilitating pro-atherosclerotic phenotypic changes in many SMCs.

AB Background and aims: Visit-to-visit variability in biological measures has been suggested as an independent predictor of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Although low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) are important risk factors of CVD, there are few studies investigating the effect of variability in LDL-C and HDL-C on cardiovascular outcomes. We investigated the association between visit-to-visit variability in LDL-C, HDL-C, and non-HDL-C and major adverse cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events (MACCE) in patients who underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).
   Methods: Data from 1792 subjects who underwent PCI from January 2004 to December 2009 were analyzed. Visit-to-visit variability was calculated using various indices: standard deviation (SD), coefficient of variation, and corrected variability independent of mean (cVIM). MACCE comprised all-cause death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, and stroke.
   Results: During a median follow-up period of 65 months, 114 subjects (6.4%) experienced MACCE: 68 (3.8%) all-cause death; 43 (2.4%) stroke, and 15 (0.8%) non-fatal myocardial infarction. Visit-to-visit variability in LDLC, HDL-C, and non-HDL-C was significantly higher in the MACCE group compared to the non-MACCE group. In multiple regression analysis, all LDL-C, HDL-C, and non-HDL-C variability parameters were independent predictors for MACCE after adjusting for potential confounding factors. Each 1-SD increase of cVIM in LDL-C, HDLC, and non-HDL-C increased the risk of MACCE by 34% (HR 1.34 [95% CI, 1.18-1.52]), 50% (HR 1.50 [95% CI 1.32-1.71]), and 37% (HR 1.37 [95% CI, 1.20-1.57]), respectively. These relationships were observed in various subgroups according to age, sex, and diabetes status.
   Conclusions: Visit-to-visit variability in LDL-C, HDL-C, and non-HDL-C is associated with MACCE in subjects with previous PCI.

AB Background and aims: The lipid accumulation product (LAP) is an index describing lipid over-accumulation based on waist circumference (WC) and fasting triglycerides, and can outperform the body mass index (BMI) in recognizing cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk. We aimed to explore the association of LAP with long-term CVD risk and compare its CVD-predictive value against common anthropometric indices/ratios of obesity.
   Methods: ATTICA is a prospective, population-based cohort that recruited 3042 adults without pre-existing CVD from the Greek general population (age 18-89 years; 1514 men). The 10-year study follow-up (2011-2012) captured the fatal/non-fatal CVD incidence in 2020 participants (50% men). Baseline LAP (cm.mmol/L) was calculated and analyzed in relation to the 10-year CVD incidence.
   Results: In total, 317 CVD cases (15.7%) were documented during the follow-up. Baseline LAP showed a significant positive association with the 10-year CVD incidence, even after adjusting for hypertension, diabetes, hypercholesterolemia, smoking, physical activity, Mediterranean diet adherence, and key pro-inflammatory biomarkers (Hazard Ratios per 10 cm.mmol/L of LAP ranging from 1.1 to 1.21, p=0.04). Moreover, LAP predicted the 10-year CVD study incidence better than common obesity indices (BMI, WC, waist-to-hip, waist-to-height ratio).
   Conclusions: These findings support a positive association between LAP and long-term CVD incidence in CVD-free Caucasian adults from the general population.

AB Background and aims: There are safety issues regarding plant sterol ester-enriched functional food. Oxidized plant sterols, also called oxyphytosterols, are supposed to contribute to plant sterol atherogenicity. This study aimed to analyze associations of plasma oxyphytosterol levels with cardiovascular events.
   Methods: Plasma cholesterol was measured by gas chromatography-flame ionization detection. Plasma campesterol and sitosterol and their 7-oxygenated metabolites were analyzed by gas chromatography-mass selective detection.
   Results: In 376 patients admitted for elective coronary angiography, who were not on lipid-lowering drugs, 82 cardiovascular events occurred during a follow-up period of 4.2 +/- 1.8 years. Patients with cardiovascular events had significantly higher 7 alpha-hydroxycampesterol plasma levels (median, 0.46; [interquartile range (IQR) 0.22-0.81] nmol/L vs. median, 0.25 [IQR, 0.17-0.61] nmol/L; p=0.003) and 7 alpha-hydroxycampesterol-to-cholesterol ratios (median 0.08 [IQR, 0.04-0.14] nmol/mmol vs. median, 0.05 [IQR 0.03-0.11] nmol/mmol; p=0.005) than controls without such events. Patients above the median were characterized by higher cumulative event rates in Kaplan-Meier-analysis (Logrank-test p=0.084 and p=0.025) for absolute and cholesterol corrected 7 alpha-hydroxycampesterol, respectively. After adjustment for influencing factors and related lipids, the hazard ratios per one standard deviation of the log-transformed variables (HR) were 1.19 [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.95-1.48], p=0.132 for 7 alpha-hydroxycampesterol and HR, 1.18 [95% CI, 0.94-1.48], p=0.154 for 7 alpha-hydroxycampesterol-to-cholesterol ratio. None of the other investigated oxyphytosterols showed an association with cardiovascular events.
   Conclusions: In patients not on lipid-lowering drugs, absolute plasma levels of 7a-hydroxycampesterol and their ratios to cholesterol are associated with cardiovascular events. Further research is required to elucidate the role of OPS in cardiovascular diseases.

AB Background and aims: Cardiac fibrosis after myocardial infarction (MI) is involved in fibroblast transforming and differentiating into myofibroblast phenoconversion, however, the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)-mediated pathogen-associated molecular patterns are key factors that deteriorate cardiac remodelling after MI. Moreover, autophagy has dual roles in cell survival in myocardial tissues after MI. We evaluated the relationship between TLR4 signalling and cardiac myofibroblast transformation-differentiation after MI in vivo and in vitro and analysed the role of autophagy.
   Methods: We reproduced a model of MI by the permanent ligation of the left anterior descending coronary artery of Tlr4-knockout (Tlr4(-/-)) and wild-type (WT) male mice. We evaluated scar formation, myofibroblast phenoconversion, LC3 dot formation, autophagy related proteins and a-smooth muscle actin (SMA) in cardiac tissues, 7, 14, and 28 days after myocardial infarction. Cardiac fibroblasts were cultured from Tlr4(-/-) or WT mice. Vimentin, alpha-SMA, bilayer membrane vesicle structures of autophagosomes, and autophagy related proteins were observed after treatment with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or 3-methyladenine (3-MA) at 24 h.
   Results: After MI on 7, 14, and 28 days, Tlr4(-/-) mice showed that heart tissue fibrosis and expression of a-SMA, a marker of myofibroblasts, were decreased compared to WT mice. Additionally, levels of LC3II, Atg5, Atg7, and Beclin-1, which are involved in autophagy, were lower than those in WT mice. Further, p62 expression, which is negatively correlated with autophagy levels, was higher in Tlr4(-/-) mice. Moreover, LC3-labelled autophagosomes in cardiac tissues were reduced in these animals. In vitro, LPS, a ligand of TLR4, stimulated a-SMA expression in cardiac fibroblasts, enhanced autophagic flux, and increased autophagosome numbers. In contrast, these effects were not obvious in Tlr4(-/-) cardiac fibroblasts. LC3II, Atg5, Atg7, and Beclin-1 were upregulated, and p62 was downregulated in cardiac fibroblasts of WT mice stimulated with LPS. However, these effects were blocked by 3-methyladenine, an inhibitor of autophagy.
   Conclusions: These results suggest that TLR4 signalling executes the development of a myofibroblast phenotype after MI via autophagy and could be therapeutically exploited to improve outcome after myocardial injury.

AB Background and aims: The individual and combined effects of type 2 diabetes (T2DM) and peripheral artery disease (PAD) on future cardiovascular events are unknown and are addressed in the present investigation.
   Methods: Cardiovascular events were prospectively recorded in 1049 subjects, encompassing 4 groups: 558 with neither PAD nor diabetes, 153 with T2DM but without PAD, 192 with PAD but without T2DM and 146 with the combination of PAD and T2DM.
   Results: Over a mean follow-up period of 7.2 +/- 2.6 years, the cardiovascular event rate was lowest in patients with neither PAD nor T2DM (16.7%). Compared to this group the event rate was not significantly increased in T2DM patients without PAD (22.2%, p=0.077) but higher in non-diabetic patients with PAD (52.6%; p < 0.001) and further increased in patients with both PAD and T2DM (71.2%; p < 0.001). Nondiabetic PAD patients were at a higher cardiovascular risk than T2DM patients without PAD (p < 0.001). Compared to those with neither PAD nor T2DM, hazard ratios after multivariate adjustment were 1.26 [0.84-1.91]; p=0.267, 4.17 [2.97-5.85]; p < 0.001, and 7.82 [5.49-11.12]; p < 0.001 for those with T2DM only, for those with PAD only and for those with the combination of PAD plus diabetes, respectively.
   Conclusions: PAD is a stronger risk factor for future cardiovascular events than T2DM, but T2DM in PAD patients accelerates atherothrombotic disease and strongly increases the incidence of cardiovascular events.

AB Background and aims: Predicting cardiovascular events is of practical benefit for disease prevention. The aim of this study was to develop and evaluate an updated risk prediction model for cardiovascular diseases and its subtypes.
   Methods: A total of 2462 community residents aged 40-84 years were followed up for 24 years. A Cox proportional hazards regression model was used to develop risk prediction models for cardiovascular diseases, and separately for stroke and coronary heart diseases. The risk assessment ability of the developed model was evaluated, and a bootstrapping method was used for internal validation. The predicted risk was translated into a simplified scoring system. A decision curve analysis was used to evaluate clinical usefulness.
   Results: The multivariable model for cardiovascular diseases included age, sex, systolic blood pressure, hemoglobin A1c, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, smoking habits, and regular exercise as predictors. The models for stroke and coronary heart diseases incorporated both shared and unique variables. The developed models showed good discrimination with little evidence of overfitting (optimism-corrected Harrell's C statistics 0.726-0.777) and calibrations (Hosmer-Lemeshow test, p=0.44-0.90). The decision curve analysis revealed that the predicted risk-based decision-making would have higher net benefit than either a CVD intervention strategy for all individuals or no individuals.
   Conclusions: The developed risk prediction models showed a good performance and satisfactory internal validity, which may help understand individual risk and setting personalized goals, and promote risk stratification in public health strategies for CVD prevention.

AB Background and aims: Acute coronary syndrome (ACS) in the very young is a rare entity, with limited data. We aimed to study patterns and profile of ACS in patients aged 20-30 years in comparison with those above 30 years.
   Methods: In this retrospective record-based study, the demographic and clinical profile of all patients with ACS in the last 12 years (n=35259) was analysed: group I (20-30 years) and group II (above 30 years). Patients in group II were selected by systematic sampling. Age, gender, domicile, body mass index (BMI), serum cholesterol, smoking, alcohol use, drug abuse, diabetes, hypertension, family history, type of ACS, angiographic findings and management strategies were recorded. Chi-square test and Fischer's exact test were used for data analysis.
   Results: Of 35,259 patients, 0.32% (n=114) were from the younger age group, with a rising trend of prevalence over 12 years. Obesity, overweight, urban living, smoking, alcohol and drug abuse were significantly higher in group I (p < 0.05). Diabetes mellitus and hypertension were more prevalent in group II (p=0.001). STEMI in group I (76.3%) and NSTEMI in group II (47.1%) were the common modes of presentation (p=0.001). 42.1% of group I patients had recanalized coronaries with conservative management in comparison to 3% in group II (p=0.001).
   Conclusions: There is a rising trend in prevalence of ACS in very young patients. Overweight, obesity, urbanization and drug abuse are potential risk factors. The younger subset of ACS patients is different from the older population due to their thrombotic milieu, which could be more amenable to intensive pharmacologic management.

AB Background and aims: The effects of a low carbohydrate/high fat (LCHF) diet on health are debated. This study aims to explore the effects of a diet with less than 20 g carbohydrates per day (LCHF) on plasma low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) in young and healthy adults. The secondary aim is the assessment of lipid profile and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) gene expression.
   Methods: This was a randomized controlled parallel-designed intervention study. Participants were either assigned to a three-week LCHF diet or a control group continuing habitual diet ad libitum, in both groups.
   Results: In total, 30 healthy normal weight participants completed the study. Nine subjects did not complete it due to adverse events or withdrawn consent. In the LCHF diet group (n=15), plasma LDL-C increased from (mean +/- SD) 2.2 +/- 0.4 mmol/l before intervention to 3.1 +/- 0.8 after, while in the control group (n=15), LDL-C remained unchanged: 2.5 +/- 0.8 mmol/l (p < 0.001 between groups). There was a significant increase in apolipoprotein B, total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, free fatty acids, uric acid and urea in the LCHF group versus controls. Plasma levels of triglycerides, lipoprotein (a), glucose, C-peptide or C-reactive protein (CRP), blood pressure, body weight or body composition did not differ between the groups. PBMC gene expression of sterol regulator element binding protein 1 (SREBP-1) was increased in the LCHF group versus controls (p=0.01). The individual increase in LDL-C from baseline varied between 5 and 107% in the LCHF group.
   Conclusions: An LCHF diet for three weeks increased LDL-C with 44% versus controls. The individual response on LCHF varied profoundly.

AB Background and aims: Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is an inherited genetic disorder of lipid metabolism characterized by a high serum LDL-cholesterol profile and xanthoma formation, and FH increases the risk of premature atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease (CVD). Mutations in the low-density lipoprotein (LDLR), apolipoprotein B (APOB), proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin 9 (PCSK9), and LDLRAP1 genes have been associated with FH. Although FH is a major risk for CVD, the disease prevalence and its underlying molecular basis in the 22 Arab countries are still understudied. This study aimed to analyze all peer-reviewed studies related to the prevalence of FH and its causative mutations in the 22 Arab countries.
   Methods: We searched five literature databases (Scopus, Science Direct, Web of Science, PubMed, and Google Scholar) from inception until June 2018, using all possible search terms to capture all of the genetic and prevalence data related to Arab patients with FH.
   Results: A total of 5,484 titles and abstracts were identified; 51 studies met our inclusion criteria for the final systematic review. Fifty-one mutations in Arab patients with FH were identified in only eight Arab countries; 47 were identified in the LDLR gene, two in the PCSK9 gene, and two in LDLRAP1 gene. Twenty mutations in the LDLR gene were distinctive to Arab patients. A few studies reported prevalence estimates, ranging from 0.4% to 6.8%.
   Conclusions: This is the first systematic review to dissect the up-to-date status of the genetic epidemiology of Arab patients with FH. It seems that FH is underdiagnosed and that its prevalence is understudied due to the dearth of published information about Arab patients with FH. Therefore, there is a need for well-controlled genetic epidemiological studies on Arab patients with FH.

AB Background and aims: Endothelial cells are main actors in vascular homeostasis as they regulate vascular pressure and permeability as well as hemostasis and inflammation. Disturbed stimuli delivered to and by endothelial cells correlate with the so-called endothelial dysfunction and disrupt this homeostasis. As constituents of the inner layer of blood vessels, endothelial cells are also involved in angiogenesis. Apolipoprotein Ls (APOL) comprise a family of newly discovered apolipoproteins with yet poorly understood function, and are suggested to be involved in inflammatory processes and cell death mechanisms. Here we investigate the role of APOLs in endothelial cells stimulated with factors known to be involved in atherogenesis and their possible contribution to endothelial dysfunction with an emphasis on inflammation driven-angiogenesis in vitro.
   Methods: Using the CRISPR/Cas9 technique, we analyzed the effect of APOL3 gene knock out in HMEC-1 endothelial cells on cell migration, tubulogenesis, endothelial permeability, intracellular signal transduction as assessed by kinase phosphorylation, and angiogenesis gene expression (measured by qRT-PCR).
   Results: Our results indicate that among the family, APOL3 was the only member induced by myeloperoxidase, oxidized LDL, VEGF and FGF treatments. APOL3 invalidation increased endothelial permeability, reduced wound repair and tubule formation in vitro, the latter only in MPO and VEGF-induced conditions. Accordingly, some pro-angiogenic signaling pathways (ERK1/2 and FAK but not Akt) and some pro-angiogenic genes were partially inhibited in APOL3 knock out cells.
   Conclusions: These findings suggest the involvement of APOL3 in angiogenesis in vitro and as a modulator of MAPK and FAK signaling in endothelial cells.

TI T2 mapping MRI technique quantifies carotid plaque lipid, and its

   THERAPY; RISK
AB Background & aims: A recently-validated, highly-sensitive T2 mapping magnetic resonance (MRI) technique accurately quantifies carotid plaque lipid. The aims of this study were to determine: (i) the extent of carotid plaque lipid in patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACS); (ii) the effects of initiation of high-intensity statin on plaque lipid content and (iii) whether plaque lipid content is related to standard or 'functional' blood lipid measurements.
   Methods: Statin naive subjects presenting with ACS underwent carotid artery MRI at 3 T scanner to quantify plaque lipid. Patients were subsequently commenced on high dose statin as part of clinical care and underwent a second MRI after three months. Plaque composition was measured using objective semi-automated techniques.
   Results: 23 out of 24 patients had measurable lipid. Three months after statin initiation there was a significant reduction in carotid lipid percentage [from 10.3% (7.2-14.2) to 7.4% (5.4-10.0), p=0.002] and a significant increase in fibrous percentage [from 83.3% +/- 6.6-85.5% +/- 4.8, p=0.039]. None of the studied functional blood biomarkers were related to either baseline carotid plaque lipid content or its propensity to change with statin treatment.
   Conclusions: T2-mapping demonstrated depleted carotid plaque lipid following the initiation of high-intensity statin treatment. Standard or 'functional' blood biomarkers were dissociated from plaque lipid content or changes with treatment. These findings further reinforce the importance of disease characterisation over risk factor assessment. Subject to clinical trial findings, quantification of plaque lipid may provide the basis for an approach to identify patients suitable for intensive lipid reduction regimes.

AB Background and aims: Despite its strong link to cardiovascular outcomes, the association of chronic kidney disease (CKD) with abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) has not been explicitly and comprehensively investigated.
   Methods: In 10,724 participants in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study (aged 53-75 years during 1996-1998), we evaluated the associations of two key CKD measures - estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR) -with incident AAA (AAA diagnosis in outpatient, hospitalization discharge, or death records). Additionally, we performed a cross-sectional analysis for the CKD measures and ultrasound-based abdominal aortic diameter in 4258 participants during 2011-2013.
   Results: During a median follow-up of 13.9 years, 347 participants developed AAA. The demographically-adjusted hazard ratio (HR) was 4.44 (95% CI 1.58-12.49) for eGFR < 30, 3.29 (1.89-5.72) for 30-44, 2.03 (1.29-3.19) for 45-59, and 1.62 (1.11-2.35) for 60-74 compared to eGFR >= 90 mL/min/1.73 m(2) and was 2.49 (1.28-4.87) for ACR >= 300, 1.99 (1.40-2.83) for 30-299, and 1.46 (1.08-1.97) for 10-29 compared to ACR < 10 mg/g. The associations were generally similar after accounting for additional confounders, such as smoking (although attenuated), or after stratifying by subgroups, including diabetes. The cross-sectional analysis also showed continuous positive associations of these CKD measures with aortic diameter, particularly at the distal aortic segment assessed.
   Conclusions: Reduced eGFR and elevated albuminuria were independently associated with greater incidence of AAA and greater abdominal aortic diameter. Our results suggest the potential usefulness of CKD measures to identify persons at high risk of AAA and the need to investigate pathophysiological pathways linking CKD to AAA.

   DENSITY; CALCIUM
AB Background and aims: Fat radiodensity, measured via CT Hounsfield units (HU), is a potential marker of fat quality. We sought to determine the cross-sectional associations of total heart fat (TAT) and aortic perivascular fat (PVAT) radiodensity with cardiovascular risk factors, coronary artery calcification (CAC), and aortic calcification (AC) in midlife women.
   Methods: Fat radiodensity, CAC, and AC were quantified using CT scans. A total of 528 women (mean age: 50.9 +/- 2.9 years; 37% Black) were included in analyses.
   Results: Women in the lowest TAT radiodensity tertile were more likely to have adverse cardiovascular risk factors. Independent of cardiovascular risk factors, women in the middle and high TAT radiodensity tertiles were less likely to have CAC (OR (95% CI): 0.32 (0.18, 0.59); 0.43 (0.24, 0.78), respectively) compared with women in the lowest TAT radiodensity tertile. Although adjusting for BMI attenuated the overall association, women in the middle TAT radiodensity tertile remained at significantly lower odds of CAC when compared to the low radiodensity tertile, 0.47 (0.24, 0.93), p=0.03. No significant associations were found for PVAT radiodensity and calcification measures in multivariable analysis.
   Conclusions: Lower TAT radiodensity was associated with a less favorable cardiometabolic profile. Women with mid-range TAT radiodensity values had a lower odds of CAC presence, independent of CVD risk factors and BMI. More research is necessary to understand radiodensity as a surrogate marker of fat quality in midlife women.

   OBJECTIVES; STATINS; CHINESE; MARKERS
AB Background and aims: South Asian (SA) individuals are thought to represent a group that is at high-risk for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). However, the performance of the Pooled Cohort Equations (PCE) remains uncertain in SAs living in the US. We aimed to study the interplay between predicted 10-year ASCVD risk and coronary artery calcium (CAC) in SAs compared to other racial/ethnic groups.
   Methods: We studied 536 SAs from the Mediators of Atherosclerosis in South Asians Living in America (MASALA) study, and 2073 Non-Hispanic Whites (NHWs), 1514 African Americans (AAs), 1254 Hispanics, and 671 Chinese Americans (CAs) from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) who were not currently on statins. We used logistic regression models to assess the association between race/ethnicity and CAC within each ASCVD risk stratum.
   Results: SAs at low and at intermediate estimated ASCVD risk were more likely to have CAC = 0 compared to NHWs, while SAs at high risk had a similar CAC burden to NHWs. For example, intermediate-risk SAs had a 73% higher odds of CAC = 0 compared to NHWs (95% 1.00-2.99), while high-risk SAs were equally likely to have CAC = 0 (OR 0.95, 95% CI 0.65-1.38) and CAC > 100 (OR 0.86, 95% CI 0.61-1.22).
   Conclusions: Our results suggest that the extent of ASCVD risk overestimation using the PCEs may be even greater among SAs considered at low and intermediate risk than among NHWs. Studies with incident ASCVD events are required to validate and/or recalibrate current ASCVD risk prediction tools in this group.

DT Article
DE Prediabetes; Diabetes; Cardiovascular disease; Nested case-control study
ID CRITERIA; JAPAN
AB Background and aims: We aimed to examine the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) with persistent prediabetes during the last four years prior to a CVD event in a large occupational cohort in Japan.
   Methods: We performed a nested case-control study using data from the Japan Epidemiology Collaboration on Occupational Health Study. A total of 197 registered cases of CVD were identified and matched individually with 985 controls according to age, sex, and worksite. Prediabetes was defined as fasting plasma glucose 100-125 mg/dL and/or HbA1c 5.7-6.4%. Persistent prediabetes was defined as having prediabetes at years one and four prior to the onset/index date; persistent normoglycemia was similarly defined. Associations between prediabetes and CVD risk were assessed using conditional logistic regression models.
   Results: Compared with people with persistent normoglycemia over the four years prior to the onset/index date, the unadjusted odds ratio (95% confidence interval) for CVD was 2.88 (1.56, 5.32) for people with persistent prediabetes. After adjusting for BMI, smoking, hypertension, and dyslipidemia assessed four years before the onset/index date, the association was slightly attenuated to an OR (95% confidence interval) of 2.62 (1.31, 5.25). Prediabetes assessed at single time points was also associated with an elevated risk of CVD, with multivariable-adjusted odds ratio (95% confidence interval) of 1.72 (1.12, 2.64) and 2.13 (1.32, 3.43) for prediabetes at one and four years prior to the onset/index date, respectively.
   Conclusions: Prediabetes is associated with an increased risk of CVD. Identification and management of pre-diabetes are important for the prevention of CVD.

   CONSTRICTION; ASSOCIATION; EXERCISE; THERAPY; IMPACT; RISK
AB Background and aims: Coronary artery disease (CAD) is now an important cause of premature death in people with HIV but the causes of accelerated CAD are poorly understood. Epicardial adipose tissue (EAT) is metabolically-active and thought to contribute to CAD development. We tested the hypothesis that abnormal coronary endothelial function (CEF), an early marker and mediator of atherosclerosis, is related to the amount of local pericoronary EAT in HIV.
   Methods: We studied 36 participants with HIV and no CAD (HIV + CAD-), 15 participants with HIV and known CAD (HIV + CAD +), and 14 age-matched, healthy participants without HIV (HIV-CAD-). To measure CEF, coronary MRI was performed before and during isometric handgrip exercise (IHE), an endothelial-dependent stressor. EAT was measured with MRI at the same imaging plane as CEF.
   Results: CEF was significantly depressed, as measured by IHE-induced % coronary cross sectional area (CSA) change, in HIV + CAD-and HIV + CAD+ as compared to HIV-CAD-participants (p < 0.0001). EAT thickness was significantly greater in HIV + CAD-and HIV + CAD+ participants as compared to HIV-CAD-participants (p = 0.001). There was a significant inverse relationship between CEF and local EAT thickness and area (R = -0.48 and R = -0.51 respectively, p < 0.0001 for both) among participants with HIV even after adjustment for cardiovascular risk factors. In participants with multiple CEF measures, CEF was lower in segments with higher EAT, other factors being equivalent.
   Conclusions: There is a significant relationship between increased metabolically-active EAT and depressed local CEF in people with HIV, consistent with the hypothesis that increased epicardial fat contributes to accelerated CAD in persons with HIV.

AB Background and aims: Statins improve clinical outcomes in patients with ischemic stroke but there is no evidence of the effect of continuing long-term statin therapy in patients with intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of continuing statin after ICH.
   Methods: Data on patients with ICH was retrieved from the National Health Insurance Research Database of Taiwan. The final population was separated into two groups according to those who continued and those who discontinued statin treatment. All-cause mortality and cardiovascular outcomes were analyzed after a 3 year follow-up after propensity score matching (PSM).
   Results: Of the 114,101 patients with ICH, who were initially enrolled, 2468 patients with dyslipidemia and ICH were included. After PSM, the benefit of statin therapy on mortality appeared from 1 year to the end of the 3 year follow-up period after discharge (statin group versus non-statin group: 4.9% vs.12.3% at 1 year (hazard ratio [HR], 0.38; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.26-0.57) and 12.9% vs. 25.3% at the end of the 3 year follow-up period (HR, 0.45; 95% CI, 0.35-0.58). Compared with the patients using lipophilic statins, those using hydrophilic statins had a significantly lower incidence of all-cause mortality (HR = 0.65, 95% CI = 0.43-0.99). There were no differences between those prescribed moderate-intensity statins and those prescribed high-intensity statins in terms of stroke and all-cause mortality (HR = 0.76; 95% CI = 0.40-1.46).
   Conclusions: There was a lower risk of all-cause mortality following ICH in patients who continued statin treatment compared with those without statin treatment, especially in those treated with hydrophilic statins.

AB Background and aims: Increased platelet reactivity (PR) associated with variable degree of coronary micro vascular impairment has been reported in patients on clopidogrel after elective percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Prasugrel provides more potent platelet inhibition than clopidogrel, though it is unknown whether it might also prevent PCI-related platelet activation. In stable patients undergoing elective PCI, we compared: (1) the effects of prasugrel vs. clopidogrel on peri-procedural variations of PR and (2) the correlation of platelet inhibition potency with PCI-induced coronary microvascular impairment.
   Methods: Forty thienopyridine-naive patients were randomly assigned to a loading dose of either prasugrel 60 mg (n = 20) or clopidogrel 600 mg (n = 20) at least 12 h before PCI. M the time of PCI, we assessed adenosine diphosphate (ADP)-induced PR with the Multiplate Analyzer, and the pressure-derived index of micro vascular resistance (IMR) in the treated coronary, both at baseline and post-procedure.
   Results: ADP-induced PR was significantly lower in the prasugrel compared with clopidogrel group both at baseline (16.0 +/- 8.7 vs. 33.9 +/- 18.0 aggregation units [AU], p < 0.001) and post-procedure (16.2 +/- 9.0 vs. 39.0 +/- 18.6 AU, p < 0.001). A significant peri-procedural increase in PR was observed in the clopidogrel group (p = 0.008), but not in the prasugrel group (p = 0.822). A significant correlation was found between IMR and PR both at baseline (r = 0.458, p = 0.003) and post-PCI (r = 0.487, p = 0.001).
   Conclusions: A loading dose of prasugrel compared with clopidogrel is able to attenuate PCI-related increase in PR in patients with stable CAD undergoing PCI, which might contribute to the beneficial effect of this drug on peri-procedural coronary microvascular function.

AB Atherosclerosis is a major underlying cause of ischemic heart diseases, ischemic stroke, and peripheral artery disease. Atherosclerotic plaque progression is characterized by chronic progressive inflammation of the arterial wall, endothelial cell dysfunction, and subendothelial lipoprotein retention. Incretin drugs, glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R) agonists, and dipeptidyl peptidase-IV (DPP-IV) inhibitors, are promising anti-hyperglycemic agents used for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). In addition to glucose-lowering effects, emerging data suggest that incretin drugs have anti-atherogenic effects with the potential to stabilize atherosclerotic plaques and treat arterial inflammation. Clinical and preclinical studies have reported a plethora of therapeutic benefits of incretin drugs, including modulation of inflammatory response, reduction of intima-media thickening, improvement in lipid profiles, endothelial and smooth muscle cell modulation. Despite extensive research and widespread clinical use of incretin-based therapies, the research on the incretin hormones continues to expand. This review outlines clinical studies, molecular aspects, and potential therapeutic implications of incretin drugs in attenuation of atherosclerosis.

TI Kruppel-like factor 14, a coronary artery disease associated

AB Background and aims: Human genetic studies indicated that variations near the transcription factor Kruppel-like factor 14 (KLF14) gene locus are highly associated with coronary artery disease. Activation of endothelial cells (ECs) by pro-inflammatory molecules and pathways is a primary step in atherosclerosis development. We aimed to investigate the effects and mechanism of KLF14 on inflammatory responses in ECs.
   Methods: Adenovirus-mediated overexpression of human KLF14 and EC specific Klf14 knockout mice were applied to study the role of KLF14 in EC inflammation. Intravital microscopy was used to examine leukocyte endothelial cell interactions in vivo.
   Results: The expression of Klf14 was markedly decreased in mouse aortic ECs in both acute and chronic inflammatory conditions. Overexpression of KLF14 inhibited inflammatory activation of human ECs stimulated by interleukin 1 beta and tumor necrosis factor a. Primary pulmonary ECs from Klf14 knockout mice showed increased expression of adhesion molecules under IL-1 beta stimuli. Mechanistically, KLF14 inhibited NF-kappa B signaling pathway by transcriptionally suppressing the expression of p65, resulting in significantly decreased leukocyte adhesion to activated ECs. Using intravital microscopy, an increased leukocyte-endothelial cell interaction was observed in endothelial specific Klf14 knockout mice compared to wild type control mice. Additionally, perhexiline, a KLF14 activator, induces KLF14 expression in ECs and reduced leukocyte-endothelial cell interactions in vitro and in vivo.
   Conclusions: The data revealed that KLF14 inhibited the inflammatory response in ECs and the protective effects were mediated by transcriptional inhibition of NF-kappa B signaling pathway. Endothelial KLF14 could be a potential therapeutic target for cardiovascular diseases.

AB Mineral bone disease (MBD) is a common complication of chronic kidney disease (CKD) characterized by disruption of normal mineral homeostasis within the body. One or more of the following may occur: hypocalcemia, hyperphosphatemia, secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT), decreased vitamin D and vascular calcification (VC). The greater the decrease in renal function, the worse the progression of CKD-MBD. These abnormalities may lead to bone loss, osteoporosis and fractures. CKD-MBD is a major contributor to the high morbidity and mortality among patients with CKD. Another well-known complication of CKD is cardiovascular disease (CVD) caused by increased atherosclerosis and VC. CVD is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in CKD patients. VC is linked to reduced arterial compliance that may lead to widened pulse pressure and impaired cardiovascular function. VC is a strong predicator of cardiovascular mortality among patients with CKD. Elevated phosphorus levels and increased calcium-phosphorus product promote VC. Controlling mineral disturbances such as hyperphosphatemia and SHPT is still considered among the current strategies for treatment of VC in CKD through restriction of calcium based phosphate binders in hyperphosphatemic patients across all severities of CKD along with dietary phosphate restriction and use of calciminetics. Additionally, Vitamin D insufficiency is common in CKD and dialysis patients. The causes are multifactorial and a serious consequence is SHPT. Vitamin D compounds remain the first-line therapy for prevention and treatment of SHPT in CKD. Vitamin D may also have atheroprotective effects on the arterial wall, but clinical studies do not show clear evidence of reduced cardiovascular mortality with vitamin D administration. This review discusses the issues surrounding CKD-MBD, cardiovascular disease and approaches to treatment.

   VALIDATION; PROJECT; EVENTS; COHORT; APS
AB Background and aims: Cardiovascular disease (CVD), including coronary artery disease and stroke/peripheral artery disease, is less commonly reported than venous thromboembolism in subjects with antiphospholipid antibodies (aPLs) and little is known about the association of CVD with adjusted Global AntiphosPholipid Syndrome Score (aGAPSS).
   Methods: Consecutive aPLs subjects were enrolled to assess the association of CVD with aGAPSS. Moreover, additional risk factors of CVD were identified by means of multivariate analysis to design an aGAPSS specific for CVD (aGAPSS(CVD)).
   Results: A total of 192 aPLs subjects (34 males, 158 females, mean age 49.84 +/- 12.0 years) were enrolled. CVD was reported in 52 subjects (27.1%), 26 episodes of coronary artery disease and 26 stroke/peripheral artery disease.
   The prevalence of CVD increased for increasing aGAPSS ranging from 20.5% in the lowest aGAPSS category, up to 37.9% in the highest category (p = 0.027). ROC analysis showed that aGAPSS detected 63.0% of CVD and was associated with OR for CVD of 2.52 (95%CI: 1.24-5.10, p = 0.010). When including obesity, diabetes and smoking habit in the score, we found that aGAPSSCVD detected 71.4% of CVD (72.4% for early-CVD and 69.0% for CVD after 50 years) with an OR for CVD of 4.68 (95%CI: 2.31-9.51, p < 0.001).
   Conclusions: The aGAPSS(CVD), obtained after adding obesity, smoking habit and diabetes to the standard aGAPSS, showed a higher detection rate of CVD in aPLs subjects, particularly of early-CVD. These results need to be validated in ad hoc designed prospective studies.

   VECTORS
AB Background and aims: The recombinant adeno-associated viral vector serotype 8 expressing the gain-of-function mutation of mouse proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (AAV8- PCSK9) is a new model for the induction of hypercholesterolemia. AAV8 preferentially infects hepatocytes and the incorporated liver-specific promoter should ensure expression of PCSK9 in the liver. Since tissue distribution of AAVs can differ between male and female mice, we investigated the differences in PCSK9 expression and hypercholesterolemia development between male and female mice using the AAV8-PCSK9 model.
   Methods: Male and female C57BL/6 mice were injected with either a low-dose or high-dose of AAV8-PCSK9 and fed a high-fat diet. Plasma lipid levels were evaluated as a measure of the induction of hypercholesterolemia.
   Results: Injection of mice with low dose AAV8-PCSK9 dramatically elevated both serum PCSK9 and cholesterol levels in male but not female mice. Increasing the dose of AAV8-PCSK9 threefold in female mice rescued the hypercholesterolemia phenotype but did not result in full restoration of AAV8-PCSK9 transduction of livers in female mice compared to the low-dose male mice. Our data demonstrate female mice respond differently to AAV8-PCSK9 injection compared to male mice.
   Conclusions: These differences do not hinder the use of female mice when AAV8-PCSK9 doses are taken into consideration. However, localization to and production of AAV8-PCSK9 in organs besides the liver in mice may introduce confounding factors into studies and should be considered during experimental design.

AB Background and aims: It is unknown whether a school-based prevention program has the potential to improve microvascular health in children. This study investigates the impact of the school-based lifestyle intervention program JuvenTUM 3 on physical activity, physical fitness, serum biomarkers and microvascular function.
   Methods: We studied 434 children (10-11 years) in a cluster-randomized setting (8 intervention schools, IG; 7 control schools, CG) over 18 months. The school-based prevention program included weekly lifestyle lessons for children with the aim to increase physical activity in and outside of school, physical fitness as well as health behavior. Anthropometric measurements and blood sampling were conducted using standard protocols, physical activity by use of a questionnaire and physical fitness by a 6-item-test battery. Central retinal arteriolar (CRAE) and venular (CRVE) vessel diameters as early marker of vascular dysfunction, as well as the arteriolar-to-venular diameter ratio (AVR), were investigated with a non-mydriatic vessel analyser.
   Results: School-based physical activity increased in 41% of children in IG (19% in CG, p = 0.038). Improvements in vascular parameters were observed for AVR (increase in 83% of children in IG versus 50% in CG; p < 0.001) and for CRVE (43% of children with retinal venular widening in IG versus 58% in CG, p = 0.019). These vascular improvements were also seen in overweight children for CRAE = 0.021) and AVR (p < 0.001).
   Conclusions: The school-based prevention program JuvenTUM 3 increased physical activity at school inducing favourable effects on retinal microvasculature function. These findings underline the importance of early lifestyle interventions in children for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease.

AB Background and aims: Some studies suggested that proprotein convertase subtilisin kexin type 9 (PCSK9) is linked to liver steatosis severity and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). We aimed to assess whether circulating PCSK9 levels are associated with either liver fat content (LFC) or histological markers of NASH in high-risk patients.
   Methods: We present results from three cross-sectional studies from two French Hospitals: Dijon and Numevox (departments of Endocrinology) and Angers (department of Hepatology). Only patients without lipid-lowering therapy were included. All 132 patients had type 2 diabetes in Dijon, compared to 55/224 in Numevox (25%) and 39/122 in Angers (32%). LFC was assessed on MRI (Dijon and Numevox), and NASH lesion on liver biopsy (Angers). Additionally, we included mRNA results from 138 overweight patients of a Belgian Hospital (Antwerp).
   Results: While circulating levels of PCSK9 were positively correlated with total cholesterol, LDL-C, triglycerides and non-HDL-C in all 3 cohorts, no significant association was found between PCSK9 and transaminases. Furthermore, no association was found between plasma PCSK9 levels and LFC in both Numevox (beta(adjusted) = 0.71 +/- 1.33, p = 0.60) and Dijon (beta(adjusted) = 1.03 +/- 0.90, p = 0.25). There was no correlation between circulating PCSK9 and histological liver lesions: steatosis severity (beta(adjusted) = -3.95 +/- 2.75, p = 0.15), NASH activity score (beta(adjusted) = -0.31 +/- 0.17, p = 0.082), lobular (beta = -0.067 +/- 0.055, p = 0.22) or portal inflammation (beta = -0.088 +/- 0.079, p = 0.27), ballooning (beta = -0.025 +/- 0.065, p = 0.70) and fibrosis (beta = -0.17 +/- 0.11, p = 0.12). Finally, hepatic PCSK9 mRNA levels were not correlated with NASH histological severity.
   Conclusions: Circulating PCSK9 concentrations are not associated with the severity of liver steatosis or histological markers of NASH. These data are reassuring regarding the clinical use of PCSK9 inhibitors in cardiovascular diseases.

AB Background and aims: The profile of cholesterol metabolism, i.e., high absorption vs. high synthesis, may have a role in the development of atherosclerosis, the early lesions of which can be present already in childhood. Since there is no information on cholesterol metabolism in children from birth to adolescence, we evaluated cholesterol metabolism in 0-15 year-old children and adolescents without dyslipidemia.
   Methods: The study population consisted of 96 children (39 girls, 57 boys) divided into age groups <1 (n = 14), 1-5 (n = 37), 6-10 (n = 24), and 11-15 (n = 21) years. Cholesterol metabolism was assessed by analysing serum non-cholesterol sterols, biomarkers of cholesterol synthesis and absorption, with gas-liquid chromatography.
   Results: Serum non-cholesterol sterol ratios to cholesterol did not differ between gender. Cholesterol precursors squalene, cholestenol, and desmosterol were higher in the <1 year than in the older age groups, whereas lathosterol was highest in the 11-15 year old. Plant sterols were low in the age group <1 year, after which they did not differ between the groups. Cholestanol was not age-dependent. From the age of 1 year, cholesterol homeostasis was intact. Cholesterol absorption prevailed cholesterol synthesis from 1 to 10 years of age (e.g., lathosterol/cholestanol ratio 0.35 +/- 0.03 and 0.45 +/- 0.05 in 1-5 and 6-10 vs. 0.66 +/- 0.08 in 11-15 year-old (mean +/- SE, p < 0.001).
   Conclusions: Serum non-cholesterol sterols had different individual profiles by age in childhood and adolescence. From 1 to 10 years of age, cholesterol absorption prevailed cholesterol synthesis. This novel finding emphasizes the importance of dietary aspects related to cardiovascular risk even from early childhood.

AB Background and aims: The lysosomal cysteine proteases cathepsin B and S have been implicated in the atherosclerotic process. The present paper investigates the association between serum levels of cathepsin B and S and cardiovascular events and mortality in patients with stable coronary heart disease.
   Methods: The CLARICOR trial is a randomised, placebo-controlled trial investigating the effect of clarithromycin versus placebo in patients with stable coronary heart disease. The outcome was time to either a cardiovascular event or all-cause mortality. The placebo group was used as discovery sample and the clarithromycin group as replication sample: n = 1998, n = 1979; mean age (years) 65, 65; 31%, 30% women; follow-up for 10 years; number of composite outcomes n = 1204, n = 1220; respectively. We used a pre-defined multivariable Cox regression model adjusting for inflammation, established cardiovascular risk factors, kidney function, and use of cardiovascular drugs.
   Results: Cathepsin B was associated with an increased risk of the composite outcome in both samples after multivariable adjustment (discovery: multivariable ratio (HR) per standard deviation increase 1.12, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.05-1.19, p < 0.001, replication; HR 1.14, 95% CI 1.07-1.21, p < 0.001). There was no significant association between cathepsin S and the composite outcome in either the discovery or replication sample after multivariable adjustment (p > 0.45). Secondary analyses suggest that cathepsin B was predominantly associated with mortality rather than specific cardiovascular events.
   Conclusions: Cathepsin B, but not serum cathepsin S, was associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular events in patients with stable coronary heart disease. The clinical implications of our findings remain to be established.

AB Background and aims: A few studies examined association between familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) in Asians with low levels of serum cholesterol. The objectives of this study were to estimate the prevalence of familial hypercholesterolemia phenotype (FH-P) and examined their associations with cardiovascular mortality among Korean population.
   Methods: The Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (KNHANES) data and data from a cohort study were used to obtain the prevalence estimate of FH-P and the association of FH-P with mortality, respectively. A cohort study included 502,966 individuals who visited health promotion centers and were given a medical examination from 1994 to 2004. FH-P was defined using the Make Early Diagnosis to Prevent Early Death (MEDPED) criteria and the modified MEDPED which substracted 20 mg/dL from original MEDPED.
   Results: FH-P prevalences defined by MEDPED and modified MEDPED among KNHANES were 0.11% and 0.25%. After 14.6-year follow-up, 23,413 deaths (3888 ASCVD) were observed. Overall, FH-P defined by MEDPED showed weaker associations with mortality compared with modified MEDPED. The hazard ratios (95% confidence intervals) of FH-P defined by modified MEDPED were 1.74 (1.46-2.07) for all-cause death, 2.18 (1.51-3.14) for ASCVD, and 2.06 (1.66-2.56) for non-cancer. Of note, the hazard ratios for all-cause death was 5.27 (2.62-10.57) among women aged less than 50 years.
   Conclusions: FH-P increased all-cause and ASCVD mortality. Long-term follow-up studies with detailed information on cause of mortality are necessary to confirm these findings. Subjects with FH are at high risk for death and need appropriate treatment and management.

AB Background and aims: Periodontal disease (PD) is believed to be associated with cardiovascular disease (CVD) events. Nevertheless, the additive prognostic value of PD for the prediction of CVD events beyond traditional risk factors is unclear, particularly when self-reported using a short questionnaire.
   Methods: In the community-based, multicenter, prospective, Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA), PD was assessed at baseline using a two-item questionnaire. We used Cox proportional hazards regression models to evaluate the independent associations between self-reported PD and coronary heart disease (CHD), CVD events, and all-cause death. In addition, the area under the receiver-operator characteristic curve (AUC) was calculated for each of the study endpoints, for models including traditional CVD risk factors alone and models including traditional CVD risk factors plus information on PD. Subgroup analyses were performed stratifying by age and tobacco use.
   Results: Among the 6640 MESA participants, high education level, high income, and access to healthcare were more frequent among individuals who self-reported PD. In multivariable analyses, null associations were observed between self-reported PD and incident CVD events, CHD events, and all-cause mortality; and self-reported PD did not improve risk prediction beyond traditional CVD risk factors in terms of AUC, for any of the three study endpoints. Subgroup analyses were consistent with the overall results.
   Conclusions: Our findings suggest that the prevalence of self-reported PD may be strongly influenced by educational status and other socioeconomic features. In this context, self-reported PD does not improve CVD risk assessment when evaluated using a brief questionnaire. Future studies should prioritize objective, dental health expert assessments of PD.

AB Background and aims: Inflammation has become a key element in cardiovascular disease, and recently, new anti-inflammatory interventions have shown promising results. In this context, CRP levels have been thoroughly studied in vitro and in animals, but studies in humans are scarce and insights into its release, site(s) of production and uptake are not uniform.
   Methods: We performed a biomarker study with multi-site sampling in the coronary circulation, in non-ST elevation MI (NSTEMI) patients with coronary angiography and right-sided catheterisation. Trans-lesional gradients were obtained by sampling distal to the culprit lesion, in patients with a suitable anatomy. To asses trans-cardiac gradients, blood was sampled from the systemic circulation, coronary sinus (CS) and great cardiac vein. Concentrations of CRP were measured with a high-sensitivity assay.
   Results: In 42 patients, a median systemic venous CRP concentration of 4.97 mg/L was observed. There was no evidence of a trans-lesional gradient (4.59 mg/L versus 4.56 mg/L, p = 0.278; n = 14). A significant decrease in CRP concentration was observed between systemic arterial and CS samples (4.88 mg/L versus 4.44 mg/L; p < 0.001; n = 42). This trans-cardiac gradient was irrespective of time of presentation, infarct size and culprit lesion location. The gradient was not only driven by blood that ran through the injured myocardium, but also by lower CRP concentrations in the coronary veins that drain non-infarcted myocardium.
   Conclusions: In the context of NSTEMI, we observed a trans-cardiac decrease in CRP, which may indicate the first human in vivo proof of a net CRP uptake by the myocardium, with a role for CRP both in the injured and adjacent myocardium.

   MECHANISMS
AB Background and aims: Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) have been implicated in atherosclerosis and vascular calcification. Among them, we reported that MMP10 is present in human atheroma, associated with atherosclerosis. However, it remains unclear whether MMP10 is involved in atherogenesis and vascular calcification.
   Methods: MMP10 was measured in serum from patients with subclinical atherosclerosis and analyzed in carotid endarterectomies by immunostaining. ApoE-deficient mice (Apoe(-/-)) were crossed to MMP10-deficient (Mmp10(-/-)) mice and followed up to 20 months. Plaque area and composition were assessed by histology and immunohistochemistry. Inflammatory markers were measured in atherosclerotic plaques by RT-qPCR, and leukocyte subpopulations were analyzed by flow cytometry. In vitro calcification assays were performed in aortic vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC).
   Results: MMP10 serum levels were associated with coronary calcification in subjects with subclinical atherosclerosis. Immunostaining revealed MMP10 expression in human atheromas, spatially associated with calcification areas, and complicated plaques released higher amounts of MMP10 than non-diseased segments. Interestingly, vascular MMP10 expression was confined to the atherosclerotic lesion in Apoe(-/-) mice, and Apoe(-/-) Mmp10(-/-) showed a substantial reduction in atherosclerotic lesion size, macrophage content and plaque calcification. Reduced local and systemic inflammatory markers could be demonstrated in Apoe(-/-) Mmp10(-/-) by gene expression and flow cytometry analysis. Calcium phosphate deposition and vascular calcification markers were downregulated in VSMC from Apoe(-/-) Mmp10(-/-) mice.
   Conclusions: Delayed plaque progression and altered cellular composition in the absence of MMP10 suggests that MMP10 plays a role in atherosclerosis, favoring inflammation, development and complication of the plaque.

AB Background and aims: Guidelines for cholesterol-lowering medication either advocate fixed dose statin treatment without low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol targets or treatment aimed at LDL cholesterol goals. The decrease in LDL cholesterol concentration determines the reduction in atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk.
   Methods: As indices of the effectiveness of reductions in LDL cholesterol concentration achieved by the various guidelines, the number of CVD events prevented in 100 people during 10 years of treatment (N-100) and the number of people, who must be treated for 10 years to prevent one CVD event (NNT), were calculated taking into account both CVD risk and pretreatment LDL cholesterol concentration. That our method of calculating NNT and N-100, could be extended to statin regimens of different intensity or of statin combined with adjunctive cholesterol-lowering medication was demonstrated by meta-analysis.
   Results: Reductions in LDL-cholesterol concentration are determined by the choice and dose of medication and by the pre-treatment LDL-cholesterol concentration. At similar CVD risk, whatever cholesterol-lowering strategy is adopted, people with higher pre-treatment LDL cholesterol benefit more than those with lower levels. Fixed dose statin regimens are less effective than target LDL cholesterol levels of 1.8 or 1.4 mmol/l when pre-treatment LDL-cholesterol levels exceed 4 mmol/l. However, fixed dose statin is more effective in people with lower initial LDL cholesterol. The predicted NNT and N-100 were closely related to the observed reduction in CVD risk in our meta-analysis.
   Conclusions: In hypercholesterolaemia, aiming for LDL cholesterol targets with statin dose titration (and when necessary adjunctive medication) is essential to optimise benefit.

AB Type 2 diabetes is a causal risk factor for the development of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). While treatment with a statin reduces the risk of having an ASCVD event in all people, including those with type 2 diabetes, statin treatment also increases the likelihood of new onset diabetes when given to those with risk factors for developing diabetes. Treatment with the cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) inhibitor, anacetrapib, reduces the risk of having a coronary event over and above that achieved with a statin. However, unlike statins, anacetrapib decreases the risk of developing diabetes. If the reduced risk of new-onset diabetes is confirmed in another CETP inhibitor outcome trial, there will be a case for considering the use of the combination of a statin plus a CETP inhibitor in high ASCVD-risk people who are also at increased risk of developing diabetes.

AB Background and aims: Uremia patients have impaired high-density lipoprotein (HDL) function and a high risk of coronary artery disease (CAD). Increased lipoprotein electronegativity can compromise lipoprotein function, but the effect of increased HDL electronegativity on HDL function and its association with CAD in uremia patient are not clear. We aimed to assess HDL electronegativity and various properties of HDL in uremia patients and investigate whether electronegative HDL is a risk factor for CAD in these individuals.
   Methods: HDL from 60 uremia patients and 43 healthy controls was separated into 5 subfractions (H1-H5) with increasing electronegativity by using anion-exchange chromatography. Lipoprotein content was analyzed by gel electrophoresis and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight-mass spectrometry. HDL anti-oxidant, anti-apoptosis and cholesterol efflux activities were examined by fluorescence-based assays.
   Results: The percentage of H5 HDL (H5%) was significantly higher in uremia patients than in controls (p < 0.001). The concentration of apolipoprotein (Apo) AI was lower and apolipoprotein modifications were more prevalent in uremia HDL subfractions than in control HDL subfractions. Carbamylation of ApoAI and ApoCIII was increased in more electronegative HDL subfractions from uremia patients. Anti-oxidant activity, anti-apoptotic activity, and cholesterol efflux capability were reduced in HDL subfractions from uremia patients when compared with control HDL subfractions. Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that H5% was associated with CAD risk in uremia patients.
   Conclusions: In HDL of uremia patients, increased electronegativity is accompanied by compositional changes and impaired function. Our findings indicate that increased H5% is associated with increased CAD risk in uremia patients.

AB Background and aims: In dialysis patients, vascular morbidities are highly prevalent and linked to leukocyte extravasation, especially of polarized monocytes. Experimental data demonstrate that phenotypic changes in monocytes require Y-box binding protein-1 (YB-1) upregulation.
   Methods: We determined YB-1 expression in circulating and vessel-invading monocytes from healthy controls and dialysis patients to correlate results with intima plaque formation and systemic inflammation.
   Results: Compared to healthy subjects, dialysis patients have fewer classical and more intermediate and non-classical monocytes. Post-translationally modified YB-1 (lysine 301/304 acetylation) is detected at high levels in the nucleus of adherent and invading CD14(+)CD68(+) monocytes from umbilical cord and atherosclerosis-prone vessels. The content of non-acetylated YB-1 is significantly decreased (p < 0.001), whereas acetylated YB-1 is correspondingly increased (p < 0.001) throughout all monocyte subpopulations, such that the overall content remains unchanged.
   Conclusions: In dialysis patients the YB-1 acetylation status is higher with prevailing diabetes and intima plaque formation. Pro-inflammatory mediators TNF alpha, IL-6, uPAR, CCL2, M-CSF, progranulin, ANP, and midkine, as well as anti-inflammatory IL-10 are significantly increased in dialysis patients, emphasizing a systemic inflammatory milieu. Strong positive correlations of monocytic YB-1 content are seen with ANP, IP-10, IL-6, and IL-10 serum levels. This is the first study demonstrating an association of cold shock protein YB-1 expression with inflammation in hemodialysis patients.

AB Background and aims: Cardiovascular disease is a common cause of morbidity and mortality, with gender differences in pathophysiology. The endothelial glycocalyx maintains vascular integrity, and glycocalyx shedding reflects endothelial dysfunction and early atherosclerosis. Syndecan-1 and -4 are components of the glycocalyx, and increased serum levels indicate glycocalyx damage. We hypothesised that increased serum syndecan-1 and -4 were independently associated with myocardial infarction (MI), ischaemic stroke and all-cause mortality in men and women from a general population.
   Methods: Using a case-cohort design, we included 1495 participants from the Tromso Study 2001-02. Syndecan-1 and -4 were measured in serum. Baseline variables also included age, gender, cardiovascular risk factors and urinary albumin-creatinine ratio (ACR). Hazard ratios were assessed using multivariable Cox regression models.
   Results: Between baseline in 2001-02 and December 2007 fatal or non-fatal MI was experienced by 328 and ischaemic stroke by 191 subjects, and 423 participants died. Syndecan-4 was independently associated with MI (hazard ratio per 10 ng/mL increase 1.32; 95% confidence interval 1.06-1.63), but not ischaemic stroke and mortality, and the associations were unchanged by adjustment for urinary ACR. Interaction between syndecan-4 and sex was borderline significant, and in gender-specific analysis, syndecan-4 was associated with MI in women only. Syndecan-1 was not associated with any endpoint.
   Conclusions: Syndecan-4 was associated with incident MI, and the association was stronger in women than in men. This suggests a link between endothelial glycocalyx shedding and coronary heart disease in women. Use of syndecan-4 as a risk marker in clinical setting needs further investigation.

TI Screening for lysosomal acid lipase deficiency: A retrospective data

LA English
DT Article
DE Lysosomal acid lipase deficiency; LAL-D; Wolman disease; Cholesteryl
   ester storage disease; Children; Screening; Dyslipidemia
ID ESTER STORAGE DISEASE; CHILDREN; LIVER; DIAGNOSIS
AB Background and aims: Lysosomal acid lipase deficiency (LAL-D) is a lysosomal storage disorder. In severe cases, it can cause life-threatening organ failure due to lipid substrates accumulation. However, mild phenotypes of this disorder are increasingly recognized. The aim of this study is to determine the number of missed LAL-D patients in a large pediatric hospital population.
   Methods: In a retrospective data mining study, the medical files of children, who visited the outpatient clinic at a university hospital between 2000 and 2016, with high plasma low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels, were evaluated. Previously developed LAL-D screening criteria, with lipid and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) values adjusted for children, were used to analyze which children are suspect for LAL-D. For suspicion of LAL-D, at least 3 out of 5 screening criteria had to be met. Subsequently data on presentation and follow-up were collected to determine if the clinical picture was compatible with LAL-D.
   Results: We identified 2037 children with high LDL-C levels. Of those, 36 children complied with 3 screening criteria. Thirty-one of those had an underlying disorder other than LAL-D that explained the abnormalities and, in the 5 remaining children, ALT and lipid levels normalized spontaneously, thus excluding LAL-D.
   Conclusions: This study shows that retrospective data mining is unlikely to yield a significant number of LAL-D cases in children. The screening algorithm adjusted for children seems useful and accurate in the selection of children for further testing, suggesting it can be applied prospectively, although further validation is warranted.

TI PHACTR1 regulates oxidative stress and inflammation to coronary artery

AB Background and aims: Genome-wide association studies have showed that genetic variants in phosphatase and actin regulator 1 (PHACTR1) are associated with coronary artery disease and myocardial infarction. However, the underlying mechanism of PHACTR1 in atherosclerosis remains unknown.
   Methods: Immunoblots were performed to evaluate the expression of PHACTR1 and phosphorylation of NF-kappa B signaling. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) labeled with DCFH-DA were assessed by flow cytometry. Fluorescence microscope was used to detect the translocation of p65 in human coronary artery endothelial cells (HACECs). Co-immunoprecipitation was performed to determine the interaction of PHACTR1 with MRTF-A.
   Results: The mRNA and protein levels of PHACTR1 were markedly increased in carotid plaquescompared with normal carotid arteries. Immunofluorescence staining indicated that PHACTR1 was constitutively expressed in endothelial cells in carotid plaques. Knockdown of PHACTR1 reduced excessive ICAM-1, VCAM-1 and VE-cadherin expression induced by oxidized low density lipoprotein (ox-LDL) in HCAECs. Additionally, silencing PHACTR1 alleviated p47phox phosphorylation and intracellular oxidative stress reflected by the reduction of ROS. Molecular experiments revealed that knockdown of PHACTR1 attenuated NF-kappa B activity without affecting I kappa B alpha and IKK alpha/beta phosphorylation. In contrast, nuclear translation of p65 was blocked by depletion of PHACTR1. Furthermore, co-immunoprecipitation showed that PHACTR1 interacted with MRTF-A and p65 in HCAECs. Knockdown of MRTF-A suppressed the interaction of PHACTR1 with p65, subsequently blocking the nuclear translocation of p65.
   Conclusions: Our finding suggest that silencing PHACTR1 alleviates the nuclear accumulation of p65 and NF-kappa B via interaction with MRTF-A, ensuing attenuating oxidative stress and inflammation in HCAECs.

AB Background and aims: Sex differences in measures of cardiovascular health in adults are well documented. However, the sex-specific aetiology of cardiovascular health across childhood and adolescence is poorly understood.
   Methods: We examined sex differences in trajectories of 11 measures of cardiovascular health from birth to 18 years, in a contemporary birth cohort study in England (N participants per outcomes: 662-13,985, N repeated measures per outcome: 1,831-112,768). Outcomes were measured over varying time spans from birth or mid childhood to age 18 and with different numbers of repeated measures per outcome. Analyses were performed using fractional polynomial and linear spline multilevel models.
   Results: Females had higher mean BMI, height-adjusted fat mass, pulse rate, insulin, triglycerides, and non-high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-c) and lower mean height-adjusted lean mass from birth or from mid childhood to age 18. For example, mean non-HDL-c was 0.07 mmol/l (95% confidence interval (CI), 0.04, 0.10) higher in females compared with males at birth. By age 18, this difference persisted and widened to 0.19 mmol/l (95% CI, 0.16, 0.23) higher non-HDL-c in females compared with males. Females had lower levels of glucose from mid-childhood and developed lower systolic blood pressure and higher HDL-c from mid-adolescence onward. For example, females had 0.08 mmol/l (95% CI, 0.05, 0.10) lower mean glucose compared with males at age seven which widened to a difference of 0.22 mmol/l (95% CI, 0.25, 0.19) at age 18.
   Conclusions: Sex differences in measures of cardiovascular health are apparent from birth or mid-childhood and change during early life. These differences may have implications for sex-specific disease risk in future adult populations.

AB Background and aims: Increased transcytosis of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) across the endothelium and oxidation of LDL deposited within the subendothelial space are crucial early events in atherogenesis. Cl q/TNF-related protein (CTRP) 5 is a novel secreted glycoprotein and its biological functions are largely undefined.
   Methods: Expression of CTRP5 was analyzed in sera and atherosclerotic plaques of patients with coronary artery disease (CAD). The role of CTRP5 in atherogenesis was investigated in vitro and in vivo.
   Results: We found CTRP5 serum levels were higher in patients with than without CAD (247.26 +/- 61.71 vs. 167.81 +/- 68.08 ng/mL, p < 0.001), and were positively correlated with the number of diseased vessels (Spearman's r = 0.611, p < 0.001). Increased expression of CTRP5 was detected in human coronary endarterectomy specimens as compared to non-atherosclerotic arteries. Immunofluorescence further showed that CTRP5 was predominantly localized in the endothelium, infiltrated macrophages and smooth muscle cells in the neointima. In vivo and in vitro experiments demonstrated that CTRP5 promoted transcytosis of LDL across endothelial monolayers, as well as the oxidative modification of LDL in endothelial cells. Mechanistically, we found that CTRP5 up-regulated 12/15-lipoxygenase (LOX), a key enzyme in mediating LDL trafficking and oxidation, through STAT6 signaling. Genetic or pharmacological inhibition of 12/15-LOX dramatically attenuated the deposition of oxidized LDL in the subendothelial space and the development of atherosclerosis.
   Conclusions: These data indicate that CTRP5 is a novel pro-atherogenic cytokine and promotes transcytosis and oxidation of LDL in endothelial cells via up-regulation of 12/15-LOX.

AB Background and aims: Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is underdiagnosed in children. We assessed a combination of two screening methods. The first method was to detect hypercholesteraemic children and then study the parents (Ch-P pathway), and the second one was to study the offspring of FH-affected parents (P-Ch pathway).
   Methods: In the Ch-P path, primary care paediatricians were asked to include lipid profiling or, at least, total cholesterol (TC) and then lipid profiling if TC was higher than 5.2 mmol/L in any clinically indicated blood test. Children with LDL-C > 3.5 mmol/L, plus either a family history of early cardiovascular disease or one parent with severe hypercholesterolemia, were referred to the lipid unit where the parents, rather than their children, were studied. In parents with definite, clinical FH, a genetic study was performed. Focused genetic testing was performed on all offspring of genetically positive parents. The P-Ch path consisted of the active study of children from definite FH adults.
   Results: Fifty-nine paediatricians covering a total population of 63,616 children agreed to participate in the project. Of the 216 children (122 Ch-P and 94 P-Ch) who were ultimately referred to the lipid unit, 87 children with FH (84% genetically positive) were identified. Additionally, 41 parents (from 40 families) were newly diagnosed with FH (63% genetically positive). Forty-nine different mutations were detected: 46 in the LDLR, 2 in the PCSK9 and 1 in APOB gene.
   Conclusions: The implementation of active strategies to detect FH in children, in close collaboration with primary care paediatricians, provides a high-performance method for early FH detection.

AB Background and aims: We aimed to evaluate the associations and prognostic value of interleukin-6 (IL6) for the prediction of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) events, heart failure (HF), and other chronic diseases in a large, multi-ethnic, contemporary population.
   Methods: We included 6617 participants from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (5640 non-users, 977 users of statins at baseline). Main outcomes were hard ASCVD events and HF; secondary outcomes included all cause death, atrial fibrillation, venous thromboembolism and cancer.
   Results: Median follow-up was 13.2 years. Strong associations were observed in Cox regression analyses between higher IL6 levels and ASCVD events, HF, and mortality, particularly among statins users. In the latter, associations remained strong after adjusting for traditional risk factors and other inflammation biomarkers (e.g., risk factor, hsCRP-adjusted hazard ratio for incident HF comparing 3rd vs. 1st IL6 tertiles: 3.55, 95% CI 1.23-10.27). Although IL6 did not improve CHD prediction beyond traditional risk factors, among statin users it improved the prediction of stroke (improvement in the C statistic +0.018), incident HF (+0.028, the largest C statistic increase across all study outcomes), and all-cause death (+0.017).
   Conclusions: IL6 is strongly and independently associated with ASCVD events, HF, and all-cause mortality, particularly among statin users. Although the prognostic value of IL6 is limited for the prediction of CHD events, it may have a role for the prediction of stroke, HF and all-cause death in asymptomatic statin users. Larger studies are needed to replicate these findings.

AB Uric acid is the end product of purine metabolism catalyzed by xanthine oxidase in humans. In the process of purine metabolism, reactive oxygen species, including superoxide, are generated concomitantly with uric acid production, which may deteriorate endothelial function through the reaction of superoxide with nitric oxide (NO), leading to decreased NO bioavailability and increased production of peroxynitrite, a reactive oxidant. Therefore, xanthine oxidase may be a therapeutic target in the treatment of endothelial dysfunction. Indeed, clinical studies have shown that endothelial dysfunction is restored by treatment with a xanthine oxidase inhibitor in patients with cardiovascular risk factors. However, it has not been fully determined whether uric acid per se is an independent causal risk factor of endothelial dysfunction in humans. Although experimental studies have indicated that uric acid absorbed into endothelial cells via the activation of uric acid transporters expressed in endothelial cells causes endothelial dysfunction through increased oxidative stress and inflammation, an actual biological effect of uric acid on endothelial function in vivo has not been fully elucidated, in part, because of the difficulty in investigating the effect of uric acid alone on endothelial function due to the close associations of uric acid with other conventional cardiovascular risk factors and the complicated relationship between uric acid and endothelial function attributed to the potent antioxidant properties of uric acid. In this review, we focus on the relationship between uric acid and endothelial function from molecular to clinical perspectives.

DT Article

   microRNA
ID DIFFERENTIAL EXPRESSION ANALYSIS; CIRCULATING MICRORNAS;
   GENE-EXPRESSION; RNA
AB Background and aims: Variation in micro-RNA (miRNA) levels in blood has been associated with alterations of physiological functions of the cardiovascular system. Circulating miRNA have the potential to become reliable biomarkers for risk stratification and early detection of cardiovascular events. Recurrent thrombotic events in patients with established coronary artery disease (CAD) demonstrate the need for personalized approaches to secondary prevention, especially in light of recent novel treatment approaches.
   Methods: In a single center cohort study, whole blood samples were collected from 437 subjects undergoing cardiac catheterization, who were followed for recurrent cardiovascular events during a mean follow up of 1.5 years. We selected a case cohort (n = 22) with recurrent thrombotic events on standard medical therapy (scent thrombosis (n = 6) or spontaneous myocardial infarction (MI) (n = 16)) and a matched cohort with CAD, but uneventful clinical follow up (n = 26), as well as a control group with cardiovascular risk factors, but without angiographic CAD (n = 24). We performed complete miRNA next generation sequencing of RNA extracted from whole blood samples (including leukocytes and platelets).
   Results: A differential pattern of miRNA expression was found among controls, CAD patients with no events, and CAD patients with recurrent events. MiRNA previously associated with MI, CAD, endothelial function, vascular smooth muscle cells, platelets, angiogenesis, heart failure, cardiac hypertrophy, arrhythmia, and stroke were found variably expressed in our case-control cohorts. Seventy miRNA (FDR < 0.05) were linked to the risk of recurrent myocardial infarction and future scent thrombosis, as compared to CAD patients with subsequently uneventful follow up.
   Conclusions: MiRNA next generation sequencing demonstrates altered fingerprint profile of whole blood miRNA expression among subjects with subsequent recurrent thrombotic events on standard medical therapy ('non-responders'), as compared to subjects with no recurrent cardiovascular events. MiRNA profiling may be useful to identify high risk subjects and provide additional insights into disease mechanisms not currently attenuated with standard medical therapy used in CAD treatment.

AB Background and aims: Although studies in mice have suggested that lesion regression is feasible, the underlying mechanisms remain largely unknown. Here we determined the impact of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) on atherosclerosis regression outcome.
   Methods: Atherosclerotic lesion dynamics were studied upon bone marrow transplantation-mediated re-introduction of apolipoprotein E (Apoe) in Apoe knockout mice. Probucol was used to pharmacologically deplete HDL.
   Results: Restoration of Apoe function was associated with an initial growth of atherosclerotic lesions and parallel decrease in lesional macrophage foam cell content (47 +/- 4% at 4 weeks versus 72 +/- 2% at baseline: p < 0.001), despite the fact that cholesterol levels were markedly reduced. Notably, significant lesion regression was detected from 4 weeks onwards, when plasma cholesterol levels had returned to the normolipidemic range. As a result, lesions were 41% smaller (p < 0.05) at 8 weeks than at 4 weeks after bone marrow transplantation. Regressed lesions contained an even lower level of macrophage foam cells (33 +/- 5%: p < 0.001) and were rich in collagen. Probucol co-treatment was associated with a 3.2-fold lower (p < 0.05) plasma HDL-cholesterol level and a more pro-inflammatory (CCR2+) monocyte phenotype. Importantly, probucol-treated mice exhibited atherosclerotic lesions that were larger than those of regular chow diet-fed bone marrow transplanted mice at 8 weeks (186 +/- 15*10(3) mu m(2) for probucol-treated versus 120 +/- 19*10(3) mu m(2) for controls: p < 0.05).
   Conclusions: We have shown that probucol-induced HDL deficiency impairs the ability of established lesions to regress in response to reversal of the genetic hypercholesterolemia in Apoe knockout mice. Our studies thus highlight a crucial role for HDL in the process of atherosclerosis regression.

AB Pregnancy-associated plasma protein-A (PAPP-A), a member of the metzincin metalloproteinase superfamily, can enhance local insulin-like growth factor (IGF) bioavailability through proteolytic cleavage of three IGF binding proteins. In patients with coronary atherosclerosis disease (CAD), elevated PAPP-A levels are significantly associated with a higher risk of cardiovascular events. Accumulating evidence indicates that this protease exerts a proatherogenic effect by altering a variety of pathological processes involved in atherosclerosis, including lipid accumulation, vascular inflammation, endothelial dysfunction, vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation and migration, plaque stability, and thrombus formation. Moreover, blockade of its proteolytic activity by stanniocalcin or microRNAs is protective against atherosclerosis development. In this review, we summarized the latest advances regarding the roles of PAPP-A in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis with an emphasis on its diagnostic and prognostic values in CAD.

AB Background and aims: We examined whether the inflammation resolution mediator lipoxin A(4) (LXA(4)) inhibits foam cell formation and oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL)-induced apoptotic signaling in macrophages and the role of circulating/local LXA(4) biosynthesis in atherogenesis.
   Methods: LXA(4) levels were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Dil-oxLDL and Dil-acLDL binding to and uptake by macrophages were evaluated by flow cytometry. Apoptosis was evaluated by TUNEL and Annexin V/PI assays.
   Results: Circulating LXA(4) levels in patients with coronary artery disease were much higher than those in respective controls. Local LXA(4) levels were much lower in rabbit atherosclerotic vessel walls. Interferon gamma (IFN-gamma) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) were elevated in atherosclerotic vessels. After the inflammatory stimulus (IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha, and C-reactive protein), LXA(4) synthesis decreased significantly in foam cells. LXA(4) dose-dependently suppressed the expression of the cholesterol uptake genes CD36 and SR-A in macrophages, which was blocked by the LXA(4) receptor antagonist BOC-2. LXA(4) also inhibited oxLDL-induced CD36 upregulation, Dil-oxLDL uptake, and foam cell formation. Furthermore, LXA(4) inhibited the oxLDL-activated c-Jun N-terminal kinase pathway and reduced oxLDL-induced macrophage apoptosis by inhibiting caspase-3 activation and restoring the mitochondrial membrane potential.
   Conclusions: We found that LXA(4) inhibited foam cell formation, oxLDL-induced inflammation, and apoptotic signaling in macrophages. Insufficient levels of the anti-inflammatory pro-resolution molecule LXA(4) were found in rabbit atherosclerotic arteries, which might contribute to preventing inflammation resolution during atherogenesis.

AB Background and aims: Platelets are critically involved in tissue repair and regeneration, which depend on their inflammatory properties and survival. SDF-1 ligates to CXCR4 and CXCR7 and contributes to the regulation of platelet survival. Platelet CXCR4/CXCR7 are involved in myocardial regeneration after infarction and are associated with outcomes in patients with symptomatic coronary artery disease. This study investigates the CXCR4/CXCR7 platelet survival axis ex vivo.
   Methods: 87 patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) were included and analyzed for platelet surface exposure of CXCR4, CXCR7, Annexin V binding and tetramethylrhodamine ethyl ester (TMRE) response. Serum of 38 patients was analyzed for FasL, TNF alpha, TNF RI, TNF RII and TRAIL with Bioplex. The majority of patients received sequential cardiac MRI (intrahospital, 6-month follow-up).
   Results: We found a strong and positive correlation between surface exposure of CXCR4 and CXCR7 (rho = 0.856, p < 0.001). Relative survival potential correlated significantly with both platelet surface exposure of CXCR4 and CXCR7 (rho = 0.365, p = 0.019; rho = 0.417, p = 0.006) and furthermore with improvement of myocardial left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) (rho = 0.490, p = 0.013). High relative survival potential showed significantly higher levels for both CXCR4 and CXCR7 surface exposure (MFI 87.3 vs. 69.0, p = 0.037; MFI 71.4 vs. 59.3, p = 0.045). We found a significant change in absolute LVEF% over the course of 6 months in patients with high CXCR7 platelet surface exposure (LVEF% 44.3 vs. 60.0, p <= 0.001).
   Conclusions: Platelet survival is associated with platelet surface exposure of CXCR4 and CXCR7 in STEMI patients and contributes to functional recovery after STEMI.

   CALCIFICATION
AB Background and aims: High density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) is associated with risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD); however, therapeutic manipulations of HDL-C have failed to reduce CVD events. This suggests that HDL-C and the atheroprotective capacity of HDL are not directly linked. The goal of this study was to evaluate the relationships between HDL-bound proteins and measures of atherosclerosis burden and HDL function.
   Methods: The HDL proteome was analyzed using mass spectrometry in 126 human subjects, who had undergone coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) to quantify calcified (CB) and non-calcified (NCB) atherosclerosis burden. Partial least squares regression analysis was used to evaluate associations between HDL-bound proteins and CB, NCB, or cholesterol efflux capacity (CEC).
   Results: Significant overlap was found among proteins associated with NCB and CEC. Proteins that were associated with NCB displayed an inverse relationship with CEC, supporting a link between this protective function of HDL and clinical plaque burden. CB was associated with a set of proteins mostly distinct from NCB and CEC. When CVD risk factors were evaluated, BMI had a stronger influence on important HDL proteins than gender, age, or HDL-C. Most HDL proteins associated with function or atherosclerosis burden were not significantly correlated with HDL-C.
   ConclusionsA These findings indicate that the HDL proteome contains information not captured by HDL-C and, therefore, has potential for future development as a biomarker for CVD risk. Additionally, the proteome effects detected in this study may provide HDL compositional goals for evaluating new and existing HDL-modification therapies.

AB The cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) system moves cholesteryl esters (CE) from high density lipoproteins (HDL) to lower density lipoproteins, i.e. very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) in exchange for triglycerides (TGs). This shuttle process will ultimately form complexes facilitating a bidirectional exchange of CE and TGs, the end process being CE delivery to catabolic sites. The CETP system is generally characteristic of higher animal species; lower species, not provided with this system, have higher and enlarged HDL enriched with apo E, suitable for tissue receptor interaction. Discovery of the CETP system has led to the development of agents interfering with CETP, thus elevating HDL-C and potentially preventing cardiovascular (CV) disease. Activation of CETP leads instead to reduced HDL-C levels, but also to an enhanced removal of CE from tissues. CETP antagonists are mainly small molecules (torcetrapib, anacetrapib, evacetrapib, dalcetrapib) and have provided convincing evidence of a HDL-C raising activity, but disappointing results in trials of CV prevention. In contrast, the CETP agonist probucol leads to HDL-C lowering followed by an increment of tissue cholesterol removal (reduction of xanthomas, xanthelasmas) and positive findings in secondary prevention trials. The drug has an impressive anti-inflammatory profile (markedly reduced interleukin-1 beta expression). Newer agents, some of natural origin, have additional valuable pharmacodynamic properties. The pharmacological approach to the CETP system remains enigmatic, although the failure of CETP antagonists has dampened enthusiasm. Studies on the system, a crossroad for any investigation on cholesterol metabolism, have however provided crucial contributions and will still be confronting any scientist working on CV prevention.

AB Background and aims: International reference values for cardiometabolic risk variables, to allow for standardization of continuous risk scores in children, are not currently available. The aim of this study was to provide international age- and gender-specific reference values for cardiometabolic risk factors in children and adolescents.
   Methods: Cohorts of children sampled from different parts of Europe (North, South, Mid and Eastern) and from the United States were pooled. In total, 22,479 observations (48.7% European vs. 51.3% American), 11,234 from girls and 11,245 from boys, aged 6-18 years were included in the study. Linear mixed-model regression analysis was used to analyze the associations between age and each cardiometabolic risk factor.
   Results: Reference values for 14 of the most commonly used cardiometabolic risk variables in clustered risk scores were calculated and presented by age and gender: systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), waist circumference (WC), body mass index (BMI), sum of 4 skinfolds (sum4skin), triglycerides (TG), total cholesterol (TC), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), TC:HDL-C ratio, glucose, insulin, homeostatic model assessment-score (HOMA-score), and cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF).
   Conclusions: This study suggests a common standard to define cardiometabolic risk in children. Adapting this approach makes single risk factors and clustered cardiometabolic disease risk scores comparable to the reference material itself and comparable to cardiometabolic risk values in studies using the same strategy. This unified approach therefore increases the prospect to estimate and compare prevalence and trends of cardiometabolic risk in children when using continuous cardiometabolic risk scores.

AB Background and aims: ODYSSEY OLE (open-label extension; NCT01954394) included patients diagnosed with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HeFH), receiving maximally tolerated statins, who had completed one of four Phase 3 double-blind parent studies (all 18 months' duration), with the aim to assess longer-term safety and efficacy of alirocumab.
   Methods: Patients received starting dose alirocumab 75 mg every 2 weeks (Q2W; patients from FH I, FH II, and LONG TERM) or alirocumab 150 mg Q2W (patients from HIGH FH). Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels were blinded to the patient and physician until Week 8; from Week 8, LDL-C levels were communicated to physicians. From Week 12, dose adjustment from 75 to 150 mg Q2W, or vice versa, was possible per physician's clinical judgment according to patients LDL-C levels.
   Results: Patients who had received alirocumab (n = 655) compared with placebo (n = 330) in the parent studies exhibited similar rates of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs; 87.3% vs. 83.9%) during OLE (2.5 years median alirocumab exposure). Overall, 33 patients (3.4%) experienced TEAEs leading to permanent treatment discontinuation. At Week 8, alirocumab reduced mean LDL-C by 44.2% (reduction from 151.9 mg/dL at parent study baseline to 84.9 mg/dL); reduction in LDL-C was consistent to Week 96 of OLE. Reductions in lipid parameters were similar regardless of treatment allocation in the parent study.
   Conclusions: In patients with HeFH, no unexpected long-term safety concerns were observed with alirocumab compared with previously published data; durability of LDL-C-lowering over 3 years (including 1.5 years of parent trials) was demonstrated.

AB Background and aims: GlycA is a relatively new biomarker for inflammation as well as cardiometabolic disease risk. However, the effect of exercise on GlycA is largely unknown. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to examine the effects of regular exercise on the inflammatory marker GlycA across seven studies and 14 exercise interventions.
   Methods: Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, specifically signal amplitudes originating from the N-acetyl methyl group protons of the N-acetylglucosamine residues on the glycan branches of glycoproteins, was used to quantify GlycA concentrations. GlycA was measured before and after completion of an exercise intervention in 1568 individuals across seven studies and 14 exercise interventions. Random effects inverse variance weighting models were used to pool effects across interventions.
   Results: Combined analysis of unadjusted data showed that regular exercise significantly (p = 2 x 10(-6)) reduced plasma GlycA (-8.26 +/- 1.8 mmol/L). This reduction remained significant (-9.12 +/- 1.9 mmol/L, p = 1.22 x 10(-6)) following adjustment for age, sex, race, baseline BMI, and baseline GlycA. Changes in GlycA were correlated with changes in traditional inflammatory markers, C-reactive protein, interleukin-6, and fibrinogen, however, these correlations were relatively weak (range r: 0.21-0.38, p < 0.0001).
   Conclusions: Regular exercise significantly reduced plasma GlycA across 14 different exercise interventions despite differences in exercise programs and study populations. The current study provides a greater understanding of the use of exercise as a potential therapy for the reduction of systemic inflammation. Further research is needed to understand the mechanisms behind the exercise-related reductions in GlycA. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Although calcific aortic stenosis is a very common disease with major adverse cardiovascular events and healthcare costs, there are no effective medical interventions to delay or halt its progression. Cardiometabolic risk factors, including smoking and male sex, are linked to aortic stenosis. Emerging studies have identified important regulatory roles for immunological and inflammatory responses, including oxidized lipids, various cytokines, and biomineralization. Recent clinical and experimental studies in atherosclerosis and osteoporosis have demonstrated that oxidative stress and oxidized lipids decrease bone formation in the skeletal system while they increase bone formation in the cardiovascular system. Multidisciplinary factors contribute to vascular calcification, including inflammation and metabolic regulation of osteogenesis in the cardiovascular system via similar signaling pathways as bone formation.
   Calcific aortic valve disease (CAVD) is no longer considered a simple passive process of calcium deposition that occurs with advanced age. Biomineralization in CAVD is a complex, regulated process that involves valvular, circulating, bone marrow-derived cells, macrophage heterogeneity and genetic factors along with biochemical and mechanical factors. The current review will discuss the recently discovered important role of inflammation, metabolic risk factors, and molecular and cellular mechanisms that promote CAVD, as well as the link between osteogenic signals in the skeletal and cardiovascular systems. This may inform future therapeutic strategies for CAVD progression.

AB Background and aims: Although a potential benefit of drinking green tea has been suggested to reduce the development of cardiovascular disease, no study has investigated the relationship between plasma tea catechin and risk of cardiovascular disease.
   Methods: A prospective, nested case-control study was conducted to examine the association between plasma tea catechin and risk of stroke and coronary heart disease (CHD) in a cohort of 29,876 men and women aged 40-69 years without history of heart disease, stroke or cancer. Participants completed a survey and donated blood samples between 1990 and 1994, and were followed-up through 2008. A total of 1132 stroke cases and 209 CHD cases, matched 1:1 to controls (n = 1132) for stroke and 1:2 to controls (n = 418) for CHD, were included in the analysis.
   Results: We found no significant association between plasma tea catechin and the incidence of stroke or CHD in either men or women. However, we found that high plasma levels of epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) were associated with reduced risk of stroke in non-smoking men; the adjusted odds ratio (95% CI) for the highest vs. non-detectable levels was 0.53 (0.29-0.98). The respective OR in male smokers was 1.23 (0.75-2.16). A significant interaction by smoking status was found for the highest vs. non-detected plasma EGCG in relation to stroke (p-for-interaction: p = 0.09).
   Conclusions: Plasma tea catechin was not associated with reduced risks of either stroke or CHD, while a protective effect of certain tea catechin on stroke risk is suggested for male non-smokers.

AB Background and aims: Angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB) are known to be beneficial for either non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) patients or diabetes mellitus (DM) patients. However, the comparative efficacy of ACEI versus ARB in patients with NSTEMI and DM is unclear. The aim of this study was to compare the protective efficacy of ACEI versus ARB in patients with NSTEMI and DM, who underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with drug-eluting stents (DES).
   Methods: Among 53,281 patients enrolled in the nationwide Korea Acute Myocardial Infarction Registry, 3426 patients with NSTEMI and DM, who were treated with renin-angiotensin system (RAS) inhibitors, had undergone successful PCI with DESs. They were classified into two groups: ACEI group (N = 2076), and ARB group (N = 1350). Individual major clinical outcomes and major adverse cardiac events (MACE), the composite of total death, myocardial infarction (MI), and revascularization were compared between the two groups for up to two years.
   Results: After propensity score-matching analysis, two propensity-matched groups (1103 pairs, total = 2206) were generated, and the baseline characteristics were balanced. Although all causes of death and recurrent MI were not different between the two groups, the incidence of revascularization (4.0% vs. 7.1%; p = 0.002), including target vessel (2.3% vs. 5.0; p = 0.002), and MACE (8.7% vs. 12.5%, p = 0.008), were lower in the ACEI group than the ARB group at two-year follow-up.
   Conclusions: Compared with ARB, no beneficial effects of ACEI on all causes of death, cardiac death, or recurrence of MI were observed, but ACEI reduced the incidence of revascularization and MACE in this population. Thus, well-designed trials with a larger population are needed to confirm these results.

AB Atherosclerosis and its complications, such as myocardial infarction and stroke, are the major causes of morbidity and mortality, and development of effective therapies for both prevention and treatment of this disease is critically important. Currently, there are many drugs available for atherosclerotic disease, but the lipid-lowering drugs statins are still the first-choice for treatment of hypercholesterolemia, a major risk factor for atherosclerosis. On the other hand, traditional Chinese medicines, mainly Chinese herbal medicines (CHM), have been widely used in China and in other Asian countries for the treatment of atherosclerotic diseases. Although many CHMs have been reported to be effective for treating atherosclerotic diseases for more than two thousand years, there are still many difficulties for their use, such as lack of scientific evidence assessed by rigorous clinical trials, complicated components and unclear pharmacological mechanisms, which often hamper the widespread use of CHMs in Western countries. Due to these concerns, CHMs are usually considered as complimentary or alternative treatment for atherosclerotic diseases. In this review, we provide an overview of the pathophysiology of atherosclerosis viewed by Western and traditional Chinese medicine, summarize pros and cons on the efficacy of CHMs for atherosclerosis and discuss what is necessary for CHM use to spread to Western societies.

AB Background and aims: It is unclear whether the obesity paradox is still apparent in the new-generation drug-eluting stent (DES) era. Therefore, we assessed the impact of body mass index (BMI) on clinical outcome after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with new-generation DESs.
   Methods: A total of 5264 consecutive patients from 4 new-generation DES registries were divided into 4 categories according to BMI: 1) underweight (BMI < 18.5 kg/m(2), n = 130), 2) normal weight (18.5 <= BMI < 25 kg/m(2), n = 2943), 3) overweight (25 <= BMI < 30 kg/m(2), n = 1932), and 4) obese (BMI >= 30 kg/m(2), n = 259). The primary endpoint was the occurrence of major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular event (MACCE) at 12 months, including all-cause mortality, nonfatal myocardial infarction, stroke, and target-vessel revascularization.
   Results: The 12-month MACCE rates decreased according to increasing BMI categories. (underweight, 13.1%; normal, 6.0%; overweight, 4.8%; obese, 4.2%; p < 0.001). After adjustment for other confounders, the underweight group had significantly higher MACCE rates than the normal-weight (hazard ratio [HR], 0.57; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.33-0.99; p = 0.049), overweight (HR, 0.49; 95% CI, 0.27-0.88; p = 0.017), and obese (HR, 0.41; 95% CI, 0.18-0.98; p = 0.044) groups. These differences were mainly driven by all-cause mortality and target-vessel revascularization. When BMI was treated as a continuous variable, BMI per 1 kg/m(2) was also an independent predictor for MACCE (HR, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.91-0.99; p = 0.008) and a MACE increase began below a BMI of 24 kg/m(2).
   Conclusions: Lower BMI was significantly associated with higher rates of MACCE and all-cause mortality after PCI. The obesity paradox is manifested in Korean patients in the new-generation DES era.

AB Background and aims: The impact of treatment strategies on outcomes in patients with stable coronary artery disease (CAD) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) according to presenting angina has not been rigorously assessed.
   Methods: We performed a patient-level pooled-analysis (n = 5027) of patients with stable CAD and T2DM randomized to optimal medical therapy [OMT], percutaneous coronary intervention [PCI] + OMT, or coronary artery bypass grafting [CABG] + OMT. Endpoints were death/myocardial infarction (MI)/stroke, post-randomization revascularization (both over 5 years), and angina control at 1 year.
   Results: Increasing severity of baseline angina was associated with higher rates of death/MI/stroke (p = 0.009) and increased need for post-randomization revascularization (p = 0.001); after multivariable adjustment, only association with post-randomization revascularization remained significant. Baseline angina severity did not influence the superiority of CABG + OMT to reduce the rate of death/MI/stroke and post-randomization revascularization compared to other strategies. CABG + OMT was superior for angina control at 1 year compared to both PCI + OMT and OMT alone but only in patients with >= Class II severity at baseline. Comparisons between PCI + OMT and OMT were neutral except that PCI + OMT was superior to OMT for reducing the rate of post-randomization revascularization irrespective of presenting angina severity.
   Conclusions: Presenting angina severity did not influence the superiority of CABG + OMT with respect to 5-year rates of death/MI/stroke and need for post-randomization revascularization. Presenting angina severity minimally influenced relative benefits for angina control at 1 year. (c) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Background and aims: Patients with hyperlipidemia who are unable to tolerate optimal statin therapy are at increased cardiovascular risk due to ongoing elevations in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). The objective of CLEAR Tranquility (NCT03001076) was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of bempedoic acid when added to background lipid-modifying therapy in patients with a history of statin intolerance who require additional LDL-C lowering.
   Methods: This phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study enrolled patients with a history of statin intolerance and an LDL-C >= 100 mg/dL while on stable lipid-modifying therapy. After a 4-week ezetimibe 10 mg/day run-in period, patients were randomized 2: 1 to treatment with bempedoic acid 180 mg or placebo once daily added to ezetimibe 10 mg/day for 12 weeks. The primary endpoint was the percent change from baseline to week 12 in LDL-C.
   Results: The study population comprised 269 patients (181 bempedoic acid, 88 placebo). Bempedoic acid added to background lipid-modifying therapy that included ezetimibe reduced LDL-C by 28.5% more than placebo (p < 0.001; -23.5% bempedoic acid, thorn5.0% placebo). Significant reductions in secondary endpoints, including non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (-23.6%), total cholesterol (-18.0%), apolipoprotein B (-19.3%), and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (-31.0%), were observed with bempedoic acid vs. placebo (p < 0.001). Bempedoic acid was well tolerated; rates of treatment-emergent adverse events, muscle-related adverse events, and discontinuations were similar in the bempedoic acid and placebo treatment groups.
   Conclusions: Bempedoic acid may provide an oral therapeutic option complementary to ezetimibe in statin intolerant patients who require additional LDL-C lowering. (c) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Background and aims: Management of familial hypercholesterolaemia (FH) may vary across different settings due to factors related to population characteristics, practice, resources and/or policies. We conducted a survey among the worldwide network of EAS FHSC Lead Investigators to provide an overview of FH status in different countries.
   Methods: Lead Investigators from countries formally involved in the EAS FHSC by mid-May 2018 were invited to provide a brief report on FH status in their countries, including available information, programmes, initiatives, and management.
   Results: 63 countries provided reports. Data on FH prevalence are lacking in most countries. Where available, data tend to align with recent estimates, suggesting a higher frequency than that traditionally considered. Low rates of FH detection are reported across all regions. National registries and education programmes to improve FH awareness/knowledge are a recognised priority, but funding is often lacking. In most countries, diagnosis primarily relies on the Dutch Lipid Clinics Network criteria. Although available in many countries, genetic testing is not widely implemented (frequent cost issues). There are only a few national official government programmes for FH. Under-treatment is an issue. FH therapy is not universally reimbursed. PCSK9-inhibitors are available in similar to 2/3 countries. Lipoprotein-apheresis is offered in similar to 60% countries, although access is limited.
   Conclusions: FH is a recognised public health concern. Management varies widely across countries, with overall suboptimal identification and under-treatment. Efforts and initiatives to improve FH knowledge and management are underway, including development of national registries, but support, particularly from health authorities, and better funding are greatly needed.

AB Background and aims: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a major cause of premature death in Lithuania where abnormal lipid levels are very common among middle-aged adults. The aim of this study was to evaluate lipid profile in middle-aged Lithuanians and perform population-based severe hypercholesterolaemia (SH) screening.
   Methods: This study included men aged 40-54 and women aged 50-64 years without overt CVD, participating in the Lithuanian High Cardiovascular Risk (LitHiR) primary prevention programme during the period 2009-2016. Lipidograms of 92,373 adults (58.4% women and 41.6% men) included in the database were analysed and screening for SH was performed.
   Results: The mean levels of total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol (LDL-C) and triglycerides (TG) among participants were 6.08 mmol/l, 3.87 mmol/l, and 1.59 mmol/l, respectively. Any type of dyslipidaemia was present in 89.7%, and severe dyslipidaemia in 13.4% of the study population.
   80.2% of adults without overt CVD had LDL-C >= 3 mmol/l. SH (LDL-C >= 6 mmol/l) was detected in 3.2% of study participants. Prevalence of SH decreased from 2.91% to 2.82% during the period 2009-2016 (p for trend = 0.003). LDL-C >= 6.5 mmol/l was observed in 1.5% of subjects while both LDL-C >= 6.5 mmol/l, and TG <= 1.7 mmol/l was found in 0.6% of subjects.
   Conclusions: SH was present in 3.2% of the middle-aged population without overt CVD. Slightly decreasing prevalence of SH was observed during the period 2009-2016 in Lithuania. Likely phenotypic familial hypercholesterolaemia was observed in 1.5% of middle-aged Lithuanians. Further clinical and genetic evaluation of people with SH is needed to detect familial forms of SH.

AB Background and aims: Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is a genetic disorder associated with high cardiovascular burden of disease. FH prevalence may vary widely across populations and data in race/ethnically diverse and admixed populations is scarce. ELSA-Brasil epidemiology may be widely generalizable in this regard, and we calculated the ELSA-Brasil FH prevalence and its variation according to age, sex and race/ethnicity.
   Methods: In 14,460 individuals aged from 35 to 75 years from the ELSA-Brasil cohort baseline, we classified FH according to the Dutch Lipid Clinic Network criteria score >= 6 (probable and definite FH). LDL-C levels were adjusted for statin use. We calculated the overall ELSA-Brasil FH prevalence and the weighted prevalence for age, sex and race/ethnic categories. We extrapolated those frequencies to the Brazilian population weighting for age-sex-race/ethnicity according to the 2015 Statistics and Geography Brazilian Institute survey.
   Results: The overall FH prevalence per 1000 individuals in ELSA-Brasil was 3.8 (2.9, 4.9) or 1 in 263. The age/sex/race-ethnicity-weighted FH prevalences were: male, 3.0 (1.7, 4.4) or 1 in 333; female, 4.1 (3.0, 5.2) or 1 in 244 (p<0.001). White race prevalence was 2.4 (1.9, 3.0) or 1 in 417; Brown, 4.9 (4.0, 5.9) or 1 in 204; and Black 6.4 (41.1, 8.7) or 1 in 156 (p<0.001). The weighted extrapolation for the Brazilian population derived similar magnitude frequencies.
   Conclusions: FH affects 1 in 263 in ELSA-Brasil and affects disproportionally more Brown (1 in 204), and Black (1 in 156), than White (1 in 417). Weighted extrapolation for the Brazilian population derived similar magnitude frequencies.

AB Background and aims: Cardiovascular risk is high in heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HeFH). The objective of this study was to describe recurrent cardiovascular events in selected patients with HeFH attending lipid clinics in France.
   Methods: We included 781 patients with a clinical (Dutch Lipid Clinic Network score >= 6) or genetic diagnosis of HeFH who had experienced a first cardiovascular event (myocardial infarction, percutaneous coronary intervention or coronary bypass, unstable angina, stroke, peripheral arterial revascularization or cardiovascular death) and were enrolled in the French Familial Hypercholesterolemia Registry (November 2015 to March 2018).
   Results: The first cardiovascular event occurred at the mean age of 47 years (interquartile range 39-55) in a predominantly male population (72%); 48% of patients were on statin therapy. Overall, 37% of patients had at least one recurrent cardiovascular event (mean of 1.8 events per patient), of which 32% occurred in the 12 months after the index event; 55% of events occurred > 3 years after the first event. Mean LDL-C at the last clinic visit was 144 +/- 75 mg/dL (132 +/- 69 mg/dL for patients on high-potency statin therapy and 223 +/- 85 mg/dL for untreated patients).
   Conclusions: The rate of recurrent cardiovascular events was high in French patients with HeFH in secondary prevention. The detection of FH during childhood is crucial to prevent CV events at a young age by early initiating statin therapy. There is a clear urgent need to expand the actual very small target population which can be treated with the PCSK9 inhibitor in France.

AB Mutations in any of three genes (LDLR, APOB and PCSK9) are known to cause autosomal dominant FH, but a mutation can be found in only similar to 40% of patients with a clinical diagnosis of FH. In the remainder, a polygenic aetiology may be the cause of the phenotype, due to the co-inheritance of common LDL-C raising variants. In 2013, we reported the development of a 12-SNP LDL-C "SNP-Score" based on common variants identified as LDL-C raising from genome wide association consortium studies, and have confirmed the validity of this score in samples of no-mutation FH adults and children from more than six countries with European-Caucasian populations. In more than 80% of those with a clinical diagnosis of FH but with no detectable mutation in LDLR/APOB/PCSK9, the polygenic explanation is the most likely for their hypercholesterolaemia. Those with a low score (in the bottom two deciles) may have a mutation in a novel gene, and further research including whole exome or whole genome sequencing is warranted. Only in families where the index case has a monogenic cause should cascade testing be carried out, using DNA tests for an unambiguous identification of affected relatives. The clinical utility of the polygenic explanation is that it supports a more conservative (less aggressive) treatment care pathway for those with no mutation. The ability to distinguish those with a clinical diagnosis of FH who have a monogenic or a polygenic cause of their hypercholesterolaemia is a paradigm example of the use of genomic information to inform Precision Medicine using lipid lowering agents with different efficacy and costs.

ID DISEASE; PROGRAM
AB Background and aims: Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is a genetic disorder associated with high risk of early major cardiovascular events (MACE) that can impact the health related quality of life (HRQoL), however, this association is unclear. This study evaluated HRQoL in index cases (IC) and first-degree relatives (FDR) of individuals at high risk of FH undergoing genetic cascade screening. Methods: Data collection was performed before awareness of molecular diagnosis results. Individuals were divided into four groups according to the molecular diagnosis: IC with (ICthorn) and without (IC-) identified mutations (n = 93 and n = 175, respectively), and affected (FDRthorn, n = 231) and non-affected (FDR-, n = 159) FDR of ICthorn. HRQoL measurements, mental (MCS) and physical component (PCS) scores were carried out with SF-12 questionnaire. Associations were tested by generalized linear models.
   Results: The mean age was 49 +/- 15 years, 42.2% were men, MACE had occurred in 30.7%. Overall, both PCS and MCS did not differ between FH and non-FH individuals, however, IC trended to have lower PCS independent of FH presence (p = 0.003). Lower PCS were associated with female sex (p = 0.018), lower education (p < 0.001), professional inactivity (p = 0.028), previous MACE occurrence (p < 0.001), hypertension (p = 0.016), depression (p < 0.001) and obesity (p < 0.001). Lower MCS were associated with female sex (p = 0.009), previous MACE occurrence (p = 0.034), depression (p < 0.001) and smoking (p = 0.009). Neither the presence of FH causing mutations nor pharmacological lipid lowering treatment was associated with HRQoL.
   Conclusions: HRQoL is not reduced in both IC and FDR FH individuals in comparison with their nonaffected counterparts. Previous MACE and co-morbidities are associated with reduced HRQoL. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Background and aims: Familial hypercholesterolaemia (FH) is the commonest monogenic disorder that accelerates atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. We compared and contrasted the characteristics of patients from three specialist centres in the southern hemisphere.
   Methods: Adult index-cases with molecularly diagnosed heterozygous FH attending specialist lipid centres in Cape Town, Perth and Sao Paulo were studied. Myocardial infarction, revascularisation, hypertension, diabetes, smoking and lipid-lowering treatment were recorded at the time of diagnosis and compared across the three centres.
   Results: The spectrum of genetic variants causative of FH was significantly different in patients attending the centres in South Africa compared with Australia and Brazil. Hypertension and diabetes were more prevalent in Brazilian and Australian patients, than in South African patients, but the frequency of smoking was significantly greater in South Africa than the other two centres (p<0.01). Age, male sex and smoking were significant independent predictors of coronary artery disease (CAD) in all three countries (p<0.05).
   Conclusions: Patients with FH in three specialist centres in the southern hemisphere exhibit a high prevalence of non-cholesterol cardiovascular disease risk factors. Older age, male sex and smoking were more common among subjects with CAD. In all three countries, there should be vigorous programmes for the control of risk factors beyond good control of hypercholesterolaemia among patients with FH. Promotion of a healthy lifestyle, especially anti-smoking advice, is of paramount importance. (c) 2018 Published by Elsevier B.V.

   IMPLEMENTATION
AB Background and aims: Although familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) can be effectively managed using cholesterol-lowering medication, patients often fall short of complete treatment adherence. Identifying the psychological factors associated with self-regulation of FH medication is important to inform interventions to maximize adherence. The aim of the present study was to test an integrated psychological model in predicting FH patients' intentions to take medication.
   Methods: FH patients attending clinics in seven countries were invited to participate in a cross-sectional survey study. Consenting patients (N = 551) completed self-report measures of generalized beliefs about medication overuse and harms, beliefs in treatment effectiveness, specific beliefs about taking medication (attitudes, subjective norms, perceived behavioral control), and intentions to take medication. Participants also completed measures of demographic variables (age, gender, education level, income, cardiovascular disease status). Data were analysed using path analysis controlling for country and demographic variables.
   Results: Attitudes (b = .331, p < 0.001), subjective norms (b = .121, p = 0.009), and beliefs about medication overuse (beta = .160, p < 0.001) were significant predictors of intentions to take medication. Treatment beliefs predicted intentions indirectly (b = .088, p < 0.001) through attitudes and subjective norms. There was also an indirect effect of beliefs about medication overuse on intentions (b = -.045, p = 0.056), but the effect was small compared with the direct effect.
   Conclusions: The findings indicate the importance among FH patients of specific beliefs about taking medication and generalized beliefs about medication overuse and treatment in predicting medication intentions. When managing patients, clinicians should emphasize the efficacy of taking cholesterol-lowering drugs and the importance of treatment outcomes, and allay concerns about medication overuse.

AB Background and aims: The relation of lipoprotein (a) [Lp(a)] and proprotein convertase substilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) levels to coronary artery disease (CAD) has been well established in the general population, while little is known about the association between Lp(a) or PCSK9 and atherosclerotic lesions of different artery sites in patients with familial hypercholesterolemia (FH).
   Methods: One hundred and fifty-one patients with verified genotyped heterozygous FH (HeFH) were enrolled. There were available data regarding coronary angiography and carotid ultrasonography in 151 patients and femoral ultrasonography in 55 patients. Coronary and carotid severity was evaluated by Gensini score and Crouse score. PCSK9 and Lp(a) concentrations were determined by ELISA and immunoturbidimetry, respectively. Finally, the correlation of PCSK9 and Lp(a) with the presence and severity of CAD and peripheral artery disease (PAD) was assessed.
   Results: The distributions of PCSK9 and Lp(a) were skewed and a close correlation between them in HeFH patients was found. PCSK9 levels were significantly higher in patients with coronary and carotid atherosclerotic lesions compared to their non-atherosclerotic groups, while no difference was found in femoral atherosclerotic lesions groups. Lp(a) levels only differed between patients with or without coronary atherosclerotic lesions. Patients with highest PCSK9 and Lp(a) concentrations had the highest prevalence and severity of atherosclerotic lesions. Multivariate regression analysis showed that PCSK9 was independently associated with CAD and PAD, while Lp(a) was only associated with CAD.
   Conclusions: Circulating PCSK9 concentrations were associated with an increased risk of CAD and PAD, while Lp(a) was only a marker for CAD in HeFH patients. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Background and aims: This study investigated risks of short-term (1 and 3 months) and long-term (1-year) recurrent stroke associated with glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) in patients with acute ischemic stroke.
   Methods: From the Taiwan Stroke Registry data, we identified 45,876 acute ischemic stroke patients from April 2006 to April 2014 and classified them into 4 groups based on the eGFR at admission: >= 90, 60-89, 30-59, and <30 mL/min/1.73 m(2) or on dialysis. The risks of 1-month, 3-month and 1-year recurrent stroke related to the eGFR levels were investigated.
   Results: Both the risks of short-term and long-term recurrent stroke increased as the eGFR levels declined. The 1-month recurrent incidence rates increased steadily from 0.54 to 0.59, 0.84 and 0.89 per 1000 person-days, as the eGFR declined from >= 90 to 60-89, 30-59, and < 30 mL/min/1.73 m(2) or on dialysis, respectively. Compared to patients with eGFR >= 90 mL/min/1.73 m(2), the adjusted subhazard ratio of 1-month recurrent stroke decreased from 1.69 (95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.24-2.31) for patients with eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m(2) or on dialysis to 1.14 (95% CI = 0.91-1.43) for patients with eGFRs of 60-89 mL/min/1.73 m(2), considering the competing risk of deaths. Similar patterns were also observed for the adjusted HRs of 3-month and 1-year recurrent stroke, but with reduced hazard values, by the corresponding eGFR levels.
   Conclusions: There is an independent graded association between an increased risk of recurrent stroke and declining eGFR levels in patients with acute ischemic stroke. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Background and aims: Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) parallels the obesity epidemic and associates with components of the metabolic syndrome (MetS). Cholesterol efflux capacity (CEC) represents a key metric of high density lipoprotein (HDL) function which may predict atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (CVD). Here we assessed the relationship of CEC with NAFLD.
   Methods: CEC was determined from THP-1 macrophage foam cells towards apolipoprotein B-depleted plasma among 639 subjects (454 men; 36 subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D); 226 with MetS), participating in the Prevention of Renal and Vascular End-Stage Disease (PREVEND) study. A Fatty Liver Index (FLI) >= 60 was used as a proxy of NAFLD.
   Results: 372 participants had a FLI >60, which coincided with an increased prevalence of T2D and MetS (p = 0.009 and p < 0.001), as well as with central obesity, higher systolic blood pressure, glucose, total cholesterol, triglycerides and high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP), and decreased HDL cholesterol (p < 0.001 for each). In multivariable linear regression analyses, CEC was inversely associated with an elevated FLI, when taking account of clinical covariates (fully adjusted model: beta = -0.091, p = 0.043), and alternatively when taking account of systolic blood pressure, waist/hip ratio, glucose, HDL cholesterol, triglycerides and hsCRP (fully adjusted model: beta = -0.103, p = 0.034).
   Conclusions: Impaired CEC is associated with NAFLD, as inferred from a FLI >= 60, even when taking account of lower HDL cholesterol and enhanced low-grade chronic inflammation. Reduced CEC could contribute to accelerated CVD in NAFLD patients. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

   RISK-FACTORS; MOUSE MODEL; ASSOCIATION
AB Background and aims: Diets enriched with tree nuts have been demonstrated to reduce the risk of atherosclerosis-related cardiovascular events. Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) shares common risk factors with atherosclerosis and AAA patients commonly have atherosclerosis related cardiovascular events. AAA has some distinct pathological and clinical characteristics to those of atherosclerosis. No previous study has examined the effect of a diet enriched with tree nuts on experimental or clinical AAA. This study investigated the effect of a diet enriched with tree nuts on the development and severity of AAA within an experimental rodent model.
   Methods: Male apolipoprotein E deficient mice were allocated to a diet enriched with tree nuts or control diet for 56 days (n = 17 per group). After 28 days, all mice were infused with angiotensin II whilst being maintained on their respective diets. The primary outcome was AAA severity assessed by the supra-renal aortic diameter, measured by ultrasound and ex vivo morphometric analysis. The severity of atherosclerosis was assessed by computer-aided analysis of Sudan IV stained aortic arches and sections of brachiocephalic arteries prepared with Van Gieson's stain.
   Results: The diet enriched with tree nuts did not influence aortic diameter or aortic rupture incidence. Mice receiving the diet enriched with tree nuts had significantly less atherosclerosis within the brachiocephalic artery (p = 0.033) but not in the aortic arch.
   Conclusions: This experimental study suggests that a diet enriched with tree nuts does not reduce the severity of AAA, but does reduce the severity of atherosclerosis within the brachiocephalic artery. The study was not powered to identify a moderate effect of the diet on the primary outcome and therefore this cannot be excluded.

AB Background and aims: Hypertension is associated with increased clinical and subclinical coronary artery disease (CAD); however, the relationship between blood pressure and coronary plaque volume is unclear. We examined the effect of systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) on coronary artery plaque volume.
   Methods: 285 subjects with stable CAD on statin therapy underwent coronary computed tomographic angiography to measure volume of fatty, fibrous, noncalcified, calcified and total coronary plaque.
   Results: Mean (SD) age was 63.1 (7.7); mean (SD) LDL-C, 78.7 mg/dL (28.5). Compared to the highest DBP tertile (>76mmHg), those in the lowest DBP tertile (<= 68 mmHg) had lower volumes of fatty: 10.0 vs. 7.7 mm(3)/mm, (p trend = 0.042), fibrous: 19.6 vs. 13.8 mm(3)/mm (p trend = 0.011), non-calcified: 29.7 vs. 22.5 mm(3)/mm (p trend = 0.017) and total plaque: 37.8 vs. 25.1 mm(3)/mm (p trend = 0.010) whereas there was no relationship with SBP tertiles. Similarly, when examined as a continuous variable, higher DBP was a significant independent predictor of higher plaque volume after multivariate adjustment: for every 1 mmHg increase in DBP, fibrous plaque increased 0.128 mm(3)/mm (p = 0.022), noncalcified plaque increased 0.176 mm(3)/mm (p = 0.045), calcified plaque increased 0.096 mm(3)/mm (p = 0.001) and total plaque increased 0.249 mm(3)/mm (p = 0.019) whereas SBP ranging from 95 to 154 mmHg did not predict plaque volume.
   Conclusions: Level of DBP predicts coronary plaque with a DBP tertile <= 68 mmHg associated with the least amount of coronary plaque in subjects with LDL-C < 80 mg/dL. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Background and aims: Cervical spondylosis (CS) is reported to be associated with vertebrobasilar insufficiency. However, few cohort studies have investigated the association between CS and posterior circulation ischemic stroke.
   Methods: The study cohort comprised 27,990 patients aged >= 18 years with a first diagnosis of CS. The controls consisted of patients with propensity score matched for age, sex, and comorbidities at a ratio of 1:1. We investigated the relationships of CS with ischemic stroke and all-cause mortality. Cox regression was used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). The average follow-up duration was 6.13 (SD = 3.18) and 6.07 (SD = 3.19) years in the CS and non-CS cohorts, respectively.
   Results: The mean age of CS patients and non-CS patients was 54.9 +/- 13.4 and 55.1 +/- 14.9 years. Fifty-eight point five percent of CS patients and 59.2% of non-CS patients were women. CS patients were 1.46 folds more likely to develop a posterior circulation ischemic stroke (95% CI, 1.23-1.72) than non-CS patients. CS patients with myelopathy exhibited a 1.50-fold risk (95% CI, 1.21-1.86) of posterior circulation ischemic stroke compared with non-CS patients; CS patients without myelopathy were at a 1.43-fold risk (95% CI, 1.18-1.73) of posterior ischemic stroke compared with non-CS patients. The risk of posterior ischemic stroke was non-significant between non-CS patients and CS patients who had received spinal anterior decompression (adjusted HR, 1.66; 95% CI, 0.78-3.52), while receiving posterior decompression was associated with a 4.23-fold risk of posterior ischemic stroke (95% CI, 1.05-17.0).
   Conclusions: This population-based study showed that CS is associated with an increased risk of posterior circulation ischemic stroke. Surgical posterior decompression was associated with the highest risk of posterior ischemic stroke.

AB Background and aims: Little information exists on the prevalence of metabolic syndrome (MetS) in Korea since 2007. We aimed to provide up-to-date estimates of the prevalence of MetS and its trend in the general adult population in Korea.
   Methods: We compared the prevalence and pattern of MetS among participants in the Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (KNHANES) IV (2007-2009), V (2010-2012), and VI (2013-2015), aged >= 19 years. Data from the 2005 census of the Korean population were presented according to age standardization.
   Results: The overall age-standardized prevalence of MetS in 2013-2015 was 20.3% (95% confidence interval [CI], 19.6%-21%). Since 2007, the overall prevalence of MetS has remained stable, whereas the prevalences among men and women, respectively, have increased and decreased slightly. By contrast, the prevalence of MetS among men aged 19-49 years has shown an increasing tendency since 2007. Moreover, nearly 40% of women aged >= 60 years had MetS in 2013-2015. Among the five components of MetS, only elevated fasting glucose level has shown an increasing trend since 2007 in both men and women. As the family income and educational level decreased, the prevalence of MetS increased.
   Conclusions: The overall prevalence of MetS has remained stable since 2007. However, the prevalence of MetS was higher in middle-aged men and women aged >= 60 years. Considering the close association between MetS and socioeconomic status, age-and sex-specific strategies should be developed at the national level for the treatment and prevention of MetS in Korea.

AB Background and aims: Exchange of cholesterol between high-density lipoprotein (HDL) particles and cells is a key process for maintaining cellular cholesterol homeostasis. Recently, we have shown that amphiphilic cargo derived from HDL can be transferred directly to lipid bilayers. Here we pursued this work using a fluorescence-based method to directly follow cargo transfer from HDL particles to the cell membrane.
   Methods: HDL was either immobilized on surfaces or added directly to cells, while transfer of fluorescent cargo was visualized via fluorescence imaging.
   Results: In Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells expressing the scavenger receptor class B type 1 (SR-B1), transfer of amphiphilic cargo from HDL particles to the plasma membrane was observed immediately after contact, whereas hydrophobic cargo remained associated with the particles; about 60% of the amphiphilic cargo of surface-bound HDL was transferred to the plasma membrane. Essentially no cargo transfer was observed in cells with low endogenous SR-B1 expression. Interestingly, transfer of fluorescently-labeled cholesterol was also facilitated by using an artificial linker to bind HDL to the cell surface.
   Conclusions: Our data hence indicate that the tethering function of SR-B1 is sufficient for efficient transfer of free cholesterol to the plasma membrane.

AB Background and aims: Lipoprotein apheresis (LA) is a complex therapeutic option and poor compliance can adversely affect treatment outcome. The aim of this study was to describe long-term compliance to treatment in patients undergoing regular LA therapy and to investigate factors related to low compliance.
   Methods: We analysed 11,391 prescribed procedures of LA performed between 1990 and 2007 in 51 patients with familial hypercholesterolemia. Regular LA treatment was initiated in patients presenting with either homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (n = 21), or severe heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (n = 30) with elevated LDL-cholesterol levels and who did not respond adequately to diet and drug therapy; the majority of these patients (n = 30) had cardiovascular disease at initiation of therapy.
   Results: The overall observed compliance rate based on the number of achieved/programmed procedures was 87.5%. Neither cardiovascular history nor subtypes of hypercholesterolemia was associated with compliance. In addition, there was no impact of patient demography on compliance. Treatment frequency alone significantly impacted non-compliance (i.e. patient with weekly procedures were less compliant). Interestingly, a non-significant decrease in compliance was observed among patients aged < 20 years.
   Conclusions: Despite the complexity of the LA procedure and its impact on the organisation of patients' daily lives, overall compliance was very high. The choice of an appropriate and adequate frequency of treatment significantly impacted patient compliance.

AB Background and aims: Research on the biologic activities of HDL, such as cholesterol efflux capacity and HDL composition, has allowed the understanding of the effect of interventions directed to improve cardiovascular risk. Previously, statin therapy has shown conflicting results about its effects on cholesterol efflux capacity of HDL; the underlying mechanisms are unclear but studies with positive effects are associated with an increase of HDL-cholesterol levels. We investigated if 10 weeks of atorvastatin therapy changes HDL efflux capacity and the chemical composition of its subpopulations.
   Methods: In a before-after design basis, HDL-cholesterol levels, chemical composition and cholesterol efflux capacity from HDL subpopulations isolated by isophynic ultracentrifugation were assessed in plasma samples from 60 patients with type 2 diabetes mellito (T2DM) at baseline and after 10 weeks of treatment with 20 mg atorvastatin. Cholesterol efflux was measured from human THP-1 cells using large, light HDL2b and small, dense 3c subpopulations as well as total HDL as acceptors. Changes of cholesterol efflux and chemical composition of HDL after treatment were analyzed. Correlations among variables potentially involved in cholesterol efflux were evaluated.
   Results: A significant decrease of 4% in HDL-cholesterol levels was observed from 47 (42-54) to 45 (39-56) mg/dL, p = 0.02. Cholesterol efflux from total-HDL and HDL2b and 3c subfractions was maintained unchanged after treatment. The total mass of HDL remained unaffected, except for the HDL3a subpopulation accounted for by a significant increase in total protein content. No significant correlations for variables previously known to be associated with cholesterol efflux were found in our study.
   Conclusions: Short therapy of 10 weeks with 20 mg of atorvastatin does not modify the cholesterol efflux capacity neither the total mass of HDL2b, HDL3c and total HDL. The discrepancy with previous reports may be due to the selective effects among different classes of statins or differences in the approaches to measure cellular cholesterol efflux.

AB Background and aims: Atherosclerosis is critically fueled by vascular inflammation through oxidized lipids and inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha. Genetic disruption of Tnf-alpha reduces atherosclerosis in experimental mouse models. However, less is known about the therapeutic potential of Tnf-alpha blockage by pharmacological inhibitors such as monoclonal antibodies, which are already approved for several inflammatory disorders in patients. Therefore, we investigated the effect of pharmacological TNF-alpha inhibition on plaque development in experimental atherosclerosis.
   Results: 10 week old male Ldlr(-/-) mice were divided into 4 groups (n = 7-10) and fed a high fat, high cholesterol diet for 6 and 12 weeks. Simultaneously, the mouse-specific anti-Tnf-alpha monoclonal antibody CNTO5048 (CNT) or a control IgG was administered.
   Results: CNT reduced circulating inflammatory markers without affecting body weight and glucose metabolism. Unexpectedly, CNT treatment increased plasma triglyceride levels and pro-atherogenic very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) cholesterol as well as plaque burden in the thoracoabdominal aorta and in the aortic root. In addition, we observed decreased smooth muscle cell content in the lesions and a trend towards reduced collagen deposition upon Tnf-alpha inhibition. Furthermore, inflammatory gene expression in the aortic arch was increased following Tnf-alpha inhibitor treatment.
   Conclusions: Although up to 12-week pharmacological inhibition of TNF-alpha in Ldlr(-/-) mice diminishes systemic inflammation, experimental plaque burden and vascular inflammatory gene expression are increased, while markers of plaque stability decrease. These observations may be explained by the development of a pro-atherogenic plasma lipid profile.

TI MicroRNA-124-3p inhibits collagen synthesis in atherosclerotic plaques

AB Background and aims: Collagen synthesis in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) is very important in atherosclerosis, as it affects plaque stability. In this study, we aim to assess whether miR-124-3p is involved in the collagen synthesis process in VSMCs and the role it might play in atherosclerotic development.
   Methods: We modulated the miR-124-3p expression in the aortic root plaques of high-fat-diet fed ApoE(-/-) mice by lentivirus injection. To determine plaque size and the content of plaque-stability-related cells or molecules, stainings, including hematoxylin and eosin, Oil red O, Sirius Red and immunohistochemical staining, were performed. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) was used to locate miR-124-3p in atherosclerotic plaques. Western blotting and RT-qPCR were carried out to determine the level of P4HA1 as well as type I and type III collagen protein and mRNA expression.
   Results: Results showed that collagen and VSMC content of plaques was inversely correlated with miR-124-3p levels. By FISH, we identified that miR-124-3p was primarily expressed by VSMCs. We also found that protein levels of type I and type III collagen in aortas and atherosclerotic plaques were decreased by miR-124-3p. We modulated miR-124-3p level in vitro and found it could inhibit collagen expression in HASMCs. This might be caused by the downregulation of P4HA1. P4HA1 was predicted as miR-124-3p's direct target, which was verified with a dual luciferase reporter assay and RIP test.
   Conclusions: The results presented here provide evidence that miR-124-3p inhibits VSMC collagen synthesis by directly targeting P4HA1, which might decrease atherosclerotic plaque stability.

AB Background and aims: Although an elevated mean platelet volume (MPV) has been associated with poor clinical outcomes after acute coronary syndrome (ACS), the association between MPV and long-term outcomes in patients with stable coronary artery disease (CAD) remains uncertain. We aimed to investigate the impact of pre-procedural MPV levels in patients following elective percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).
   Methods: We studied 2872 stable CAD patients who underwent their first PCI and who had available data on pre-procedural MPV between 2002 and 2016. Patients were divided into quartiles based on their MPV. The incidences of major adverse cardiac events (MACE), including all-cause death and non-fatal myocardial infarction, were evaluated.
   Results: The median MPV was 10.4 fL (interquartile range: 9.8-11.0). During a median follow-up of 5.6 years, 498 (17.3%) MACE were identified, with a cumulative incidence significantly higher in the lowest MPV group than in other groups (p < 0.01). After adjustment for platelet count and the other cardiovascular risk factors, the lowest MPV group had a significantly higher risk of MACE compared with the highest MPV groups (hazard ratio: 1.43, 95% confidence interval 1.10-1.86, p = 0.009). Decreasing MPV as a continuous variable was associated with the incidence of MACE (hazard ratio: 1.16 per 1 fL decrease, 95% confidence interval 1.04-1.30, p = 0.007).
   Conclusions: Contrary to previous studies on ACS patients, this study showed that a low MPV was associated with worse clinical outcomes among stable CAD patients.

AB Background and aims: This study aimed to investigate the effects of long non-coding RNA (lncRNA)-nuclear-enriched abundant transcript (Neat1) on myocardial ischemia reperfusion injury in diabetic rats ex vivo and in vivo.
   Methods: Screening for LncRNA Neat1 expression was performed in rat myocardial tissues using microarray analysis and verified by qRT-PCR. Cell viability of rat cardiomyocytes was analyzed by MTT assay. Levels of autophagy-related proteins Atg7, Atg5, LC3-II/LC3-I and p62 were determined by Western blot assay. Left ventricular end diastolic diameter (LVEDD), left ventricular end systolic diameter (LVESD), left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and fractioning shortening were obtained by transthoracic echocardiography. Left ventricular end systolic pressure (LVESP), left ventricular end diastolic pressure (LVEDP), maximum rate of increase or decrease of left ventricular pressure (+/- dp/dtmax) and heart rate were obtained by computer algorithms and an interactive videographics programme. Myocardial infarct size was determined by Evans blue and triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining. Myocardial apoptotic index was analyzed by TUNEL assay and immunohistochemical staining. Autophagic flux was examined by evaluating fluorescent LC3 puncta.
   Results: Neat1 was highly expressed in ischemia reperfusion-treated diabetic rat myocardial tissues. Overexpression of Neat1 promoted the production of lactate dehydrogenase, inhibited superoxide dismutase content and cardiomyocyte viability. Neat1 overexpression also promoted the production of serum myocardial enzymes, including creatine kinase and creatine kinase-MB, and increased infarct size. By promoting myocardial apoptosis and autophagy, Neat1 aggravated myocardial ischemia reperfusion (I/R) injury in diabetic rats. Neat1 promoted cardiomyocyte autophagy by up-regulating Foxo1 expression to increase hypoxia-reoxygenation injury.
   Conclusions: I/R treatment caused more injuries in diabetic rats compared with normal rats. Elevated Neat1 expression aggravates myocardial ischemia reperfusion injury via activation of apoptosis and autophagy in diabetic rats. Foxo1 is one of the molecular mechanisms underlying Neat1-induced autophagy.

   COHORT; DRUGS
AB Background and aims: A potential increased risk of cardiovascular events has been suggested for proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), the most commonly prescribed drugs for the management of upper gastrointestinal disorders. We aimed to estimate the risk of hospitalization for cardio/cerebrovascular (CV) events in a cohort of incident PPI users.
   Methods: A nested case-control study was carried out using regional healthcare utilization databases. For each case (hospitalization for non-haemorrhagic CV event), up-to-five controls randomly selected from the cohort were matched by gender, age at cohort entry, and index date. Exposure was estimated as recency of therapy (current, recent and past users) and number of days covered. Adjusted conditional logistic regression was used to estimate the association between exposure and outcome.
   Results: Among new PPI users, we identified 17,832 cases and 89,160 controls (males 64.9%; mean age 58.9 years). Cases showed a significantly higher prevalence of use of drugs for diabetes, hypertension and hypercholesterolemia than controls. Risk of CV events was significantly higher for current (OR 1.61; 95%CI 1.55-1.68) and recent users (OR 1.15; 95%CI 1.06-1.26) compared to past users. Analogous results were found stratifying for cardiovascular (ORcurrent 1.71; 95%CI 1.63-1.81) and cerebrovascular events (ORcurrent 1.43; 95%CI 1.34-1.54). The increased risk was confirmed in subgroups by antithrombotic, statin use, or exposure duration. The same analysis for H2-antagonists use showed no significant results.
   Conclusions: In primary care setting, PPI use was independently associated with increased risk of first-time cardiovascular event, consistent with the evidence that PPIs adversely impact vascular function, underlying the need to promote appropriate prescribing of these drugs.

AB Background and aims: Progranulin is a circulating protein that modulates inflammation and is found in atherosclerotic lesions. Here we determined whether inflammatory cell-derived progranulin impacts atherosclerosis development.
   Methods: Ldlr(-/-) mice were transplanted with bone marrow from wild-type (WT) or Grn(-/-)(progranulin KO) mice (referred to as Tx-WT and Tx-KO, respectively).
   Results: After 10 weeks of high-fat diet feeding, both groups displayed similarly elevated plasma levels of cholesterol and triglycerides. Despite abundant circulating levels of progranulin, the size of atherosclerotic lesions in TxKO mice was increased by 47% in aortic roots and by 62% in whole aortas. Aortic root lesions in Tx-KO mice had increased macrophage content and larger necrotic cores, consistent with more advanced lesions. Progranulin staining was markedly reduced in the lesions of Tx-KO mice, indicating little or no uptake of circulating progranulin. Mechanistically, cultured progranulin-deficient macrophages exhibited increased lysosome-mediated exophagy of aggregated low-density lipoproteins resulting in increased cholesterol uptake and foam cell formation.
   Conclusions: We conclude that hematopoietic progranulin deficiency promotes diet-induced atherosclerosis in Ldlr(-/-) mice, possibly due to increased exophagy-mediated cholesterol uptake. Circulating progranulin was unable to prevent the increased lesion development, consistent with the importance of progranulin acting via cell-autonomous or local effects.

AB Background and aims: CD36 is a cholesterol receptor involved in the uptake of oxidized low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and development of atherosclerotic plaques. Cross-sectional studies have shown correlations between plasma CD36 and atherosclerosis but no prospective study has examined the association yet. We prospectively examined the association between plasma CD36 levels and risk of incident coronary heart disease (CHD) in a Danish population.
   Methods: Plasma CD36 levels were measured in a case-cohort study nested within the Danish population-based cohort, the Diet, Cancer and Health Study. A total of 1963 incident CHD events occurred between baseline (1993-1997) and 2008, and a sub-cohort of 1759 participants were randomly selected as reference. Cox proportional hazard regression models were used to compute the hazard ratio (HR) and corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI).
   Results: After adjusting for CHD risk factors, including history of hypercholesterolemia and diabetes, elevated plasma CD36 levels were not associated with higher CHD risk in the total population, and the HR comparing the highest versus lowest tertile of CD36 levels was 1.02 (95% CI: 0.84-1.23). High CD36 levels were only found to be associated with risk of CHD in combination with prevalent diabetes (HR=2.83, 95% CI: 1.08-7.45) vs. the joint reference group of lowest CD36 tertile and no diabetes.
   Conclusions: Plasma CD36 levels were not predictive of CHD risk in the general population.

AB Background and aims: We aimed to identify novel biomarkers for cardiovascular mortality through a non-targeted metabolomics approach in patients with established atherosclerotic disease from the Tor Vergata Atherosclerosis Registry (TVAR).
   Methods: We compared the serum baseline metabolome of 19 patients with atherosclerosis suffering from cardiovascular death during follow-up with the baseline serum metabolome of 20 control patients matched for age, gender, body mass index (BMI) and atherosclerotic disease status, who survived during the observation period.
   Results: Three metabolites were significantly different in the cardiovascular mortality (CVM) group compared to controls: 2-hydroxycaproate, gluconate and sorbitol. 2-hydroxycaproate (otherwise known as alpha hydroxy caproate) was also significantly correlated with time to death. The metabolites performed better when combined together rather than singularly on the identification of CVM status.
   Conclusions: Our analysis led to identify few metabolites potentially amenable of translation into the clinical practice as biomarkers for specific metabolic changes in the cardiovascular system in patients with established atherosclerotic disease. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Background and aims: A novel method to estimate low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) has been proposed by Martin et al. This may permit a more accurate estimation of cardiovascular risk, however, external validation is needed. Here, the performance of LDL-C using this new method (LDL-N) is compared with LDL-C estimated with Friedewald equation (LDL-F) in familial combined hyperlipidemia (FCHL), a common primary dyslipidemia in which apolipoprotein B containing particle composition is abnormal and interferes with LDL-C estimation.
   Methods: A total of 410 FCHL subjects were included. LDL-C was estimated with both the Friedewald equation (LDL-F) and the novel formula (LDL-N). Apolipoprotein B levels and non-HDL-C were recorded. The correlation and concordance between LDL-F and LDL-N and both Apolipoprotein B and non-HDL-C levels were calculated. Analysis stratifying for triglyceride tertiles and FCHL lipid phenotypes was also carried out.
   Results: The correlations between LDL-N and Apo B and non-HDL-C were rho = 0.777 (95%CI 0.718-0.825) and rho = 0.735 (95%CI 0.648-0.816), respectively. The corresponding correlations for LDL-F were rho = 0.551(95%CI 0.454-0.637) and rho = 0.394 (95%CI 0.253-0.537), respectively. In mixed dyslipidemia or isolated hypertriglyceridemia, these correlations were significantly better using LDL-N. With respect to concordance, LDL-N performed significantly better than LDL-F when considering apoB <90 mg/dL (kappa LDL-N = 0.495 vs. kappa LDL-F = 0.165) and non-HDL-C <130 (kappa LDL-N = 0.724 vs. kappa LDL-F = 0.253).
   Conclusions: In FCHL, LDL-C estimation using Martin's formula showed greater correlation and concordance with non-HDL-C and Apo B compared with the Friedewald equation. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Background and aims: Patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) and prior revascularization are at high risk of further cardiovascular events and may require additional lipid-lowering therapies beyond maximally tolerated statin therapy. We assessed the efficacy and safety of alirocumab, a proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibitor, in patients with ASCVD, with or without prior coronary revascularization (percutaneous coronary intervention [PCI] or coronary artery bypass graft [CABG]).
   Methods: Data from eight controlled (placebo/ezetimibe) phase 3 ODYSSEY trials were pooled and stratified by trial design: alirocumab 150 mg or 75 mg with possible dose increase to 150 mg (75/150 mg) every 2 weeks (Q2W) versus placebo, and alirocumab 75/150 mg Q2W versus ezetimibe. Most patients received background maximally tolerated statin therapy.
   Results: Among 4629 randomized patients with hypercholesterolemia, 3382 had ASCVD including 2191 with prior revascularization. Although baseline characteristics were comparable between alirocumab and control groups, revascularized patients were more likely to be male, have had prior myocardial infarction/stroke, have higher lipoprotein (a) and PCSK9 levels, and were more often treated with high-intensity statin therapy. Alirocumab significantly reduced low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C; primary endpoint; p < 0.0001), lipoprotein (a), non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and apolipoprotein B levels from baseline to week 24 (vs. control), regardless of stratified treatment group or revascularization status. On-treatment LDL-C levels with alirocumab ranged from 45.6 to 64.8 mg/dL. Alirocumab had a similar safety profile regardless of revascularization status, and higher rates of injection-site reactions versus controls.
   Conclusions: Alirocumab is generally well-tolerated and effective with a similar safety profile in high-risk patients with or without prior revascularization (PCI/CABG). (c) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Background and aims: Pulse pressure (PP) is a surrogate of aortic stiffness (AS) easily obtainable. The link between AS and cardio-vascular disease is documented, however, data regarding acute coronary syndrome (ACS) patients are scarce and contradictory. We aimed to assess the prognostic value of PP measured at admission, with regard to major adverse outcomes (all-cause mortality, recurrence of MI, and stroke), during the first year following an acute coronary syndrome (ACS).
   Methods: The SPUM-ACS project is a prospective cohort study of patients with ACS conducted in 4 Swiss University hospitals. Patients with no PP at admission or with severe clinical heart failure or cardiogenic shock were excluded. Cox regression analyses were performed to determine associations between PP and outcomes (all-cause mortality, recurrence of myocardial infarction (MI), and stroke). Three multivariate Cox regression models were adjusted for hemodynamic, cardiovascular, and non-cardiovascular confounders, added successively.
   Results: Of 5635 eligible patients, 5070 met the inclusion criteria. Mean patient age was 63 years (range: 54-72), 79.6% were male, and mean blood pressure and PP were 93.9 +/- 15.6 and 54 +/- 17 mmHg, respectively. Multivariate analyses confirmed the prognostic significance of PP for each 10-mmHg increase for the composite endpoint, hazard ratio (HR) 1.126 [1.051-1.206], p = 0.001; all-cause mortality, HR1.129 [1.013-1.260], p = 0.029; and recurrence of MI, HR1.206 [1.102-1.320], p < 0.001; but not for stroke, HR1.014[0.853-1.205].
   Conclusions: PP measured at admission is a strong, independent prognostic marker predicting mortality and recurrence of MI after ACS. PP should be considered for the management of secondary prevention. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Background and aims: Marked hypercholesterolemia, defined as low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels >= 190 mg/dL, may be due to LDLR, APOB, and PCSK9 variants. In a recent analysis, only 1.7% of cases had such variants. Our goal was to identify other potential genetic causes of hypercholesterolemia.
   Methods: In a total of 51,253 subjects with lipid testing, 3.8% had elevated total cholesterol >300mg/dL and/or LDL-C >= 190 mg/dL. Of these, 246 were further studied, and 69 without kidney, liver, or thyroid disease and who met Dutch Lipid Clinic Network criteria of >= 6 points had DNA sequencing done at the LDLR, APOB, PCSK9, APOE, LDLRAP1, STAP1, ABCG5, ABCG8, CYP27A1, LIPA, LIPC, LIPG, LPL, and SCARB1 gene loci and also had 10 SNP analysis for a weighted high LDL-C genetic risk score.
   Results: In the 69 subjects with genetic analyses, the following variants were observed in 37 subjects (53.6%): LDLR (n = 20, 2 novel), ABCG5/8 (n = 7, 2 novel), APOB (n = 3, 1 novel), CYP27A1 (n = 3, 1 novel), LIPA (n = 2, 1 novel), APOE (n = 2), LIPC (n = 1, novel), LIPG (n = 1, novel), and SCARB1 (n = 1); 14 subjects (20.3%) had a high polygenic score, with 4 (5.8%) having no variants.
   Conclusions: Our data indicate that in addition to variants in LDLR, APOB, PCSK9, APOE, LDLRAP1, and STAP1, variants in ABCG5/8, CYP27A1, LIPA, LIPC, and LIPG may be associated with hypercholesterolemia and such information should be used to optimize therapy.

AB Background and aims: Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is one of the most frequent diseases with monogenic inheritance. Previous data indicated that the heterozygous form occurred in 1:250 people. Based on these reports, around 36,000-40,000 people are estimated to have FH in Hungary, however, there are no exact data about the frequency of the disease in our country. Therefore, we initiated a cooperation with a clinical site partner company that provides modern data mining methods, on the basis of medical and statistical records, and we applied them to two major hospitals in the Northern Great Plain region of Hungary to find patients with a possible diagnosis of FH.
   Methods: Medical records of 1,342,124 patients were included in our study. From the mined data, we calculated Dutch Lipid Clinic Network (DLCN) scores for each patient and grouped them according to the criteria to assess the likelihood of the diagnosis of FH. We also calculated the mean lipid levels before the diagnosis and treatment.
   Results: We identified 225 patients with a DLCN score of 6-8 (mean total cholesterol: 9.38 +/- 3.0 mmol/L, mean LDL-C: 7.61 +/- 2.4 mmol/L), and 11,706 patients with a DLCN score of 3-5 (mean total cholesterol: 7.34 +/- 1.2 mmol/L, mean LDL-C: 5.26 +/- 0.8 mmol/L).
   Conclusions: The analysis of more regional and country-wide data and more frequent measurements of total cholesterol and LDL-C levels would increase the number of FH cases discovered. Data mining seems to be ideal for filtering and screening of FH in Hungary. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Background and aims: We aimed to estimate the frequency of cardiovascular diseases in familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) patients in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
   Methods: We screened lipid profiles in the hospital system during the period March 2008-November 2016, and included 307 patients with LDL>4.5 mmol/L. FH was diagnosed according to the Dutch Lipid Clinic Network (DLCN) criteria. Followed parameters were: the presence of coronary artery disease (CAD), premature CAD (defined as men<55yrs, women<65yrs), cerebral vascular disease (CVD). Patients were divided into 4 groups according to the DLCN criteria: Group1 - definite FH, Group2 - probable FH, Group 3 - possible FH, Group4 - unlikely FH. Patients with incomplete data and secondary causes of hyperlipidemia were not included. Statistical analysis was done using the SPSS software package Version 19.0.
   Results: There were 307 patients. Group1 counted 16 patients; Group2, 56; Group3, 140, and Group4, 95. In Group1, CAD was diagnosed in 7 patients (43.75%); PCAD in 7 (43.75%); CVD in 2 (12.5%). In Group2, CAD was diagnosed in 25 patients (44.6%); PCAD in 23 (41.1%); and CVD in 8 (14.3%). In Group3, CAD was diagnosed in 64 cases (45.7%); PCAD in 29 (20.7%); and CVD in 47 (33.6%). In Group4, CAD was diagnosed in 19 patients (20%); PCAD in 3 (3.2%); and CVD in 73 (76.8%). CAD was significantly more present in Groups 1,2 and 3 compared with Group4. Occurrence of PCAD was statistically significant in patients with definite and probable FH compared with Groups 3 and 4 (p < 0.05). There was a significant difference in the appearance of CVD in Group4 compared with Groups 1,2 and 3.
   Conclusions: Definitive and possible FH groups were strongly associated with PCAD and CAD, while CVD was significantly higher in the unlikely FH group. Screening program and worldwide information exchange are essential to spread the knowledge about FH prevalence. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Background and aims: In Switzerland, the prevalence of familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) due to pathogenic apolipoprotein B-100 gene (APOB) variants was known, but not the prevalence of FH due to pathogenic low-density lipoprotein-receptor gene (LDLR) variants. Phenotypic differences (LDLR versus APOB) might affect the diagnostic value of the Dutch Lipid Clinic Network (DLCN) score and Simon Broome Diagnostic Criteria (SBDC).
   Methods: A total of 2734 Swiss subjects were investigated, 2221 unselected subjects from three representative population surveys for estimation of the prevalence (LDLR variants), and 513 subjects from the DIAgnosis and Management Of familial hypercholesterolemia in a Nationwide Design (DIAMOND-FH) study for comparisons of phenotypic characteristics (LDLR versus APOB variants), diagnostic values of clinical scores, and cardiovascular outcome.
   Results: In 7 of 2221 individuals, FH (LDLR) was diagnosed (prevalence of FH due to LDLR variants: 1/317, prevalence of FH due to both LDLR and APOB variants: 1/125 to 1/135). In FH (APOB) patients under 35 years of age, mean total cholesterol (TC) was <8.5 mmoL/L but increased above 35. In FH (LDLR), TC was > 8.5 mmoL/L in all age groups. This difference was crucial for the diagnosis of FH and resulted in a significantly lower sensitivity of clinical scores in FH (APOB) (DLCN: 13.8%, p < 0.0001; SBDC: 22.5%, p = 0.005). Thus, both scores were not useful for the definite diagnosis of FH due to APOB variants. Regarding the cardiovascular outcome, no differences (LDLR versus APOB) were found above 60 years. In countries with high percentages of FH due to APOB variants, cascade screening and molecular testing appear to be much more cost-effective.

AB Familial hypercholesterolaemia (FH) is a genetic disorder affecting the metabolism of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) particles, leading to high LDL-cholesterol levels maintained over time and higher risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) early in life.
   Contemporary studies have challenged prior estimations of FH prevalence and suggest this condition to be more frequent than previously considered, with an overall prevalence rate of 1:200-300 individuals in the general population (1:160,000-300,000 for homozygous FH). However, prevalence of FH varies around the world. In part this is due to an artefact of approaches of detection and methods used to diagnose FH (e.g. lack of gold standard for diagnosis of FH, different criteria applied, availability of genetic testing). But also due to intrinsic characteristic of different populations, e.g. higher presence of founder effects or rates of consanguinity. Additionally, results from many regions are lacking and it is estimated that only a small percentage of subjects with FH would have been diagnosed overall.
   FH entails a significantly higher risk of CVD, reported to be higher than that estimated by conventional risk assessment tools for the general population. This risk is mainly driven by coronary heart disease. Despite this evidence, low rates of patients meet therapeutic targets for cardiovascular prevention, and implementation of therapy (high intensity statins, combination therapy) is needed. The introduction of novel lipid-lowering therapies may improve this situation.
   In the present review, we discuss the epidemiology of FH overall, with special attention to different aspects related to prevalence, cardiovascular risk and prognosis, and treatment of FH. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Background and aims: Despite the use of statins, familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) patients often have increased LDL-cholesterol (Ch) and high risk for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). This study aimed to analyze the effect of statin therapy on attainment of LDL-Ch treatment targets and appearance of new ASCVD and diabetes in FH patients.
   Methods: This study is a retrospective analysis of data from medical records of 302 FH patients treated continuously with statins during 3 years. At baseline and once yearly, anthropometric measurements, lipids (total Ch, LDL-Ch, HDL-Ch, triglycerides, apoliporotein A1 and B), fasting plasma glucose, and insulin were determined.
   Results: In FH patients, high intensity statin was prescribed only in 17.9% of cases. LDL-Ch levels were significantly lower after 3 years of statin treatment (3.61 +/- 1.19 mmol/l) vs. baseline (4.51 +/- 1.69 mmol/l; p < 0.01), but only 6.9% of FH patients reached the recommended >= 50% LDL-Ch reduction and 16.2% attained the LDL-Ch <2.6 mmol/l target. Simultaneously, 9.6% of FH patients developed new ASCVD, with lower HDL-Ch after 3 years of statin treatment than in those who remained free of ASCVD. In addition, we observed new onset diabetes in 6.4% of FH patients who were more obese, older and with higher fasting glucose at baseline than FH patients free of diabetes, regardless of the type of statin.
   Conclusions: These results imply that only a small proportion of FH patients achieved the recommended LDL-Ch treatment targets, mostly due to the use of low statin dose and infrequent implementation of high-intensity statin treatment, which altogether could not prevent the increase in residual cardiovascular risk.

ID GENERAL-POPULATION; PREVALENCE; GUIDANCE; MANAGEMENT; DISEASE
AB Background and aims: Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is one of the most frequent monogenic cholesterol disorders. Its prevalence varies in adults between 1/500-1/217 individuals in the heterozygous form. The objective of this study was to uncover the FH prevalence in Romania to perform an adequate prevention for high risk individuals.
   Methods: We have conducted an epidemiological study between January 2015 and January 2018 by recruiting patients from the CardioPrevent Foundation based on their FH score (taking into account their low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDLc) levels, clinical characteristics such as premature coronary artery disease (CAD), and their family history of premature cardiovascular disease). We have calculated the probability of FH using the Dutch Lipid Clinic Network (DLCN) criteria and we have included patients with a score over 3 points.
   Results: We have enrolled 59 patients, out of whom 61% were females. 8.4% of the patients recruited had a first degree relative with premature coronary artery disease and 5% had a relative with LDLc > 190 mg/dl (without statin treatment). 10.16% of the patients had coronary artery disease and 15.25% peripheral vascular disease. 91.52% of the patients had a possible FH, while 6.7% had a probable FH and 1.6% a definite FH diagnosis. Based on this data, the prevalence of FH in Romania is: 1:213.
   Conclusions: To raise the suspicion for FH is easy at the level of the general practitioners, based on the analysis of LDLc levels and premature CAD occurrence. Diagnosis can be further refined using an available online free software.

AB Background and aims: Although familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is one of the most common genetic disorders, it remains largely underdiagnosed and undertreated. The Hellenic Atherosclerosis Society has established the Hellenic Familial Hypercholesterolemia (HELLAS-FH) Registry, part of the Familial Hypercholesterolemia Studies Collaboration (FHSC), to evaluate the characteristics and management of patients with FH in Greece.
   Methods: Patients with diagnosed FH were recruited by a network of sites throughout Greece. The prevalence of cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors, as well as management of FH, was recorded.
   Results: This interim analysis included 1093 patients (556 male; 950 adults). The median age of FH diagnosis was 42.2 years (interquartile range 27.2-53.0). A family history of CVD was present in 47.8%, while 21.1% of patients had a personal history of CVD. At diagnosis, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) was 241 +/- 76mg/dL in adults and 229 +/- 57 mg/dL in children. Overall, 63.1% of the patients were receiving hypolipidemic drug treatment, mainly statins, at inclusion in the registry. Mean LDL-C of patients receiving drug treatment was 154 +/- 76mg/dL in adults and 136 +/- 47 mg/dL in children. The majority of treated patients (87.9%) did not achieve LDL-C targets.
   Conclusions: FH in Greece is characterized by a significant delay in diagnosis and a high prevalence of both family and personal history of established CVD. The vast majority of FH patients do not achieve LDL-C targets. Improved awareness and management of FH are definitely needed.

AB Background and aims: Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is amongst the most common genetic disorders encountered in primary care. Yet, only a minority of affected patients is diagnosed and treated. This interim analysis of the CaRe High Registry aims at examining the state of treatment and attainment of lipid goals in German FH patients.
   Methods: The CaRe High registry includes FH patients from lipid clinics and private practices. Data have been collected using questionnaires filled in by the recruiting physicians and by interviewing the participating patients.
   Results: We examined 512 F H patients diagnosed according to clinical criteria. Median age at the time of the first FH diagnosis was 39 (25th and 75th percentile: 27-50) years, median treatment naive LDL cholesterol (LDLC) was 239.4 mg/dl (6.19 mmol/l), 25th to 75th percentile 191.8-342.5 mg/dl (4.96-8.86 mmol/l). 27% of the participants did not receive lipid-lowering drugs. Among the patients treated with lipid-lowering drugs, 19% received a PCSK9 inhibitor (PCSK9i) in combination with a statin, 9% were treated with a PCSK9i alone and 3% were treated with a combination of PCSK9i and a non-statin drug. Patients with pre-existing CVD were more likely to be treated with lipid-lowering drugs and more likely to receive a PCSK9i, but LDL-C targets were only achieved by a minority of patients (<20%). Gap to target LDL-C was lowest and the median achieved LDL-C reduction was 1.4 times higher with PCSK9i treatment than with (oral) lipid-lowering therapy without PCSK9i.
   Conclusions: The Care High registry has included patients with the typical clinical features of familial hypercholesterolemia. PCSK9i treatment in addition to standard therapy allows attainment of target values in many patients with initially very high LDL-C.

AB Background and aims: Maximal doses of potent statins are the cornerstone of treatment of familial hypercholesterolemia (FH). Despite this, a substantial proportion of FH patients are either under-treated or not treated at all. The aim of this work was to evaluate, in a retrospective study, the treatment of FH patients, the proportion of FH patients reaching low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) goals, and reasons for not reaching LDL-C goals, in 8 lipid clinics in Slovakia dealing with FH patients.
   Methods: 201 heterozygous FH patients (50.8 +/- 14.9 years, 55% females) who attended the lipid clinics at least three times were included in the study.
   Results: At the first visit, 31.3% of patients were treated with statins and the most common dose was 20 mg of atorvastatin, rosuvastatin and simvastatin. At the third visit, 78.1% of patients were treated with statins and 24.4% with ezetimibe. The majority of patients were treated with atorvastatin (75.8%) and rosuvastatin (18.5%) and 31.3% of all patients were treated with atorvastatin 80 mg or rosuvastatin 40 mg with/without ezetimibe. However, only 11.9% of patients with the LDL-C goal level <2.5 mmol/l and 6.9% with the goal <1.8 mmol/l reached the level. Reasons for not reaching the goal levels were evaluated by physicians in each patient. Insufficient LDL-C lowering effect of treatment, side-effects of therapy and non-compliance of patients were responsible for 46%, 18% and 30% of cases, respectively.
   Conclusions: Referral of FH patients to lipid clinics in Slovakia leads to improvement in the treatment; however, almost 22% of the patients are still without statin treatment and the majority of patients do not reach the LDL-C goal level. (c) 2018 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Background and aims: Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is characterized by markedly increased LDLcholesterol (LDL-C) and premature cardiovascular disease (CVD). LDL-C lowering is the cornerstone of therapy. The aim of our study was to evaluate LDL-C target achievement and explore reasons for not reaching target in FH patients attending a public-sector lipid clinic at Groote Schuur Hospital in Cape Town, South Africa.
   Methods: We reviewed clinical records of patients with genetically confirmed heterozygous FH (heFH) retrospectively. For patients seen after 2013, when new guidelines were published, we determined reasons for use of submaximal therapy.
   Results: Our study population consisted of 776 adult heFH patients. A substantial proportion (41%) of those younger than 50 years of age had already experienced a cardiovascular event. The mean (+/- SD) untreated and best achieved LDL-C values during follow up were 8.1 +/- 2.1 and 4.0 +/- 1.5mmol/l, respectively. Despite a mean LDL-C reduction of 50%, only 140 (25%) achieved an LDL-C <= 3.0 mmol/l. Of the 164 participants with follow up after 2013, 42 did not reach LDL-C < 3.0 mmol/l and did not use maximal therapy (26%). The commonest reasons for not using maximum therapy were statin side-effects (n = 15, 36%) and acceptance by the patient (n = 9, 22%) or the physician (n = 8, 19%) of the control achieved.
   Conclusions: The heFH population in Cape Town is characterized by high baseline LDL-C, a high prevalence of CVD at presentation and low rates of achieving an LDL-C target of 3.0 mmol/l. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Background and aims: Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is a common genetic disease of high-level cholesterol leading to premature atherosclerosis. One of the key aspects to overcome FH burden is the generation of largescale reliable data in terms of registries. This manuscript underlines the important results of nation-wide Turkish FH registries (A-HIT1 and A-HIT2).
   Methods: A-HIT1 is a survey of homozygous FH patients undergoing low density lipoprotein (LDL) apheresis (LA). A-HIT2 is a registry of adult FH patients (homozygous and heterozygous) admitted to outpatient clinics. Both registries used clinical diagnosis of FH.
   Results: A-HIT1 evaluated 88 patients (27 +/- 11 years, 41 women) in 19 centers. All patients were receiving regular LA. There was a 7.37 +/- 7.1-year delay between diagnosis and initiation of LA. LDL-cholesterol levels reached the target only in 5 cases. Mean frequency of apheresis sessions was 19 +/- 13 days. None of the centers had a standardized approach for LA. Mean frequency of apheresis sessions was every 19 +/- 13 (7-90) days. Only 2 centers were aware of the target LDL levels. A-HIT2 enrolled 1071 FH patients (53 +/- 8 years, 606 women) from 31 outpatients clinics specialized in cardiology (27), internal medicine (1), and endocrinology (3); 96.4% were heterozygous. 459 patients were on statin treatment. LDL targets were attained in 23 patients (2.1% of the whole population, 5% receiving statin) on treatment. However, 66% of statin-receiving patients were on intense doses of statins. Awareness of FH was 9.5% in the whole patient population.
   Conclusions: The first nationwide FH registries revealed that FH is still undertreated even in specialized centers in Turkey. Additional effective treatment regiments are urgently needed.

AB Background and aims: Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) was rarely diagnosed in Latvia before 2015, when the Latvian Registry of FH (LRFH) was established. Here, we report the first experience of the LRFH over three years (2015-2017).
   Methods: The LRFH is an ongoing nationwide, dynamic, long-term prospective cohort. The diagnosis of FH was assessed using the Dutch Lipid Clinic Network (DLCN) criteria. Cascade screening of first-degree relatives using age-and sex-specific percentiles of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) was performed in relatives of patients with definite and probable FH.
   Results: Among the 416 individuals included in the LRFH, 181 patients were diagnosed with FH (140 index cases and 41 relatives) and 151 with possible FH (not analysed in this report). The mean age was 51.3 +/- 14.1 years, 38.1% (n = 69) were men and 35.4% (n = 64) had a history of premature coronary heart disease. Only 54.1% (n = 98) of patients were on any lipid-lowering therapy before inclusion in the LRFH. The maximal statin dose was used by 23.2% (n = 42), and only 4.4% (n = 8) had their LDL-C levels below the goal. The initial mean total and LDL-C levels were 7.7 +/- 2.2 and 5.5 +/- 2.1 mmol/L, respectively. In a subgroup of patients (n = 49) with follow-up, LDL-C levels were reduced from 6.1 +/- 2.1 to 3.6 +/- 1.7 mmol/ L (p < 0.001).
   Conclusions: An estimated 2.3% of FH patients in Latvia were diagnosed within three years. The vast majority of FH patients were under-recognized and poorly treated before their inclusion in the LRFH. Specialized care of FH patients within the frames of the registry substantially improved the management of this high-risk group. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Background and aims: Despite the high prevalence of familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) and available effective lipid-lowering therapy, most of the individuals with this disorder remain undiagnosed and undertreated. The aim of the PLANET registry was to assess the real-life attainment of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) therapeutic target level in patients with heterozygous FH, to characterize prescribed lipid-lowering therapy with assessment of its efficiency according to the attainment of the target LDL-C level, and to characterize cardiovascular events observed in this patient population again in relation to LDL-C target level attainment.
   Methods: PLANET registry was designed as a non-interventional, retrospective, cross-sectional, multicentre disease registry for adult patients with heterozygous FH in the Czech Republic and Slovakia.
   Results: Overall, 1755 patients were enrolled at 32 sites specialized in FH treatment. 15.4% of patients attained the target LDL-C value. The proportion of patients with LDL-C goal achievement increased to 17.3% in the subgroup of patients receiving high-intensity statin therapy (54.6% of study population). Out of 55 patients receiving inhibitors of proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9), 61.8% reached the LDL-C treatment goal. Of all cardiovascular events reported, 14.0% occurred in patients attaining the LDL-C goal, while it was 86.0% in the not-at-target group. It was documented (p= 0.004) that the longer is the patient in care at the specialized FH centre, the higher is the probability that he/she will attain the target LDL-C level.
   Conclusions: Although target LDL-C level attainment remains relatively low, the likelihood of LDL-C goal attainment increases with duration of specialized care.

AB Background and aims: Prevalence of familial hypercholesterolemia (FH), a common genetic disorder with a high risk for coronary artery disease (CAD), is high among CAD patients; however, data on FH prevalence among acute coronary syndrome (ACS) patients are limited. EXPLORE-J is the largest registry to diagnose FH among Japanese ACS patients using the 2012 Japan Atherosclerosis Society guidelines.
   Methods: This prospective study consecutively recruited patients between April 2015 and August 2016 at 59 sites. Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels, family history of premature CAD, presence of tendon xanthomas, and Achilles tendon radiograms were recorded at baseline. The prevalence rate of FH in patients with ACS was estimated with 95% CI.
   Results: Of 1944 analyzed patients (mean age, 66.0 years; men, 80.3%), 52 (2.7% [95% CI: 2.0-3.5]) had FH. Thirty-one (1.6%) had LDL-C >= 180 mg/dL and Achilles tendon thickness (ATT) >= 9 mm, 8 (0.4%) had LDL-C >= 180 mg/dL and family history of premature CAD, 10 (0.5%) had ATT >= 9mm and family history of premature CAD, and 3 (0.2%) met all the criteria. FH patients were younger than those without FH (59.5 [12.5] vs. 66.2 [12.1] years; p < 0.001). More patients with premature ACS (men, <55 years; women, <65 years) than without (4.7% [95% CI: 2.9-7.2] vs. 2.1% [1.4-3.0]) had FH.
   Conclusions: FH prevalence is at least five-fold higher in ACS patients than in the general population, especially in patients with premature ACS onset and ATT >= 9 mm. FH screening in ACS patients is therefore clinically important and critical. (c) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Background and aims: Familial hypercholesterolaemia (FH) is an autosomal dominant lipoprotein disorder characterized by significant elevation of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and markedly increased risk of premature cardiovascular disease (CVD). Because of the very high coronary artery disease risk associated with this condition, the prevalence of FH among patients admitted for CVD outmatches many times the prevalence in the general population. Awareness of this disease is crucial for recognizing FH in the aftermath of a hospitalization of a patient with CVD, and also represents a unique opportunity to identify relatives of the index patient, who are unaware they have FH. This article aims to describe a feasible strategy to facilitate the detection and management of FH among patients hospitalized for CVD.
   Methods: A multidisciplinary national panel of lipidologists, cardiologists, endocrinologists and cardio-geneticists developed a three-step diagnostic algorithm, each step including three key aspects of diagnosis, treatment and family care.
   Results: A sequence of tasks was generated, starting with the process of suspecting FH amongst affected patients admitted for CVD, treating them to LDL-C target, finally culminating in extensive cascade-screening for FH in their family. Conceptually, the pathway is broken down into 3 phases to provide the treating physicians with a time-efficient chain of priorities.
   Conclusions: We emphasize the need for optimal collaboration between the various actors, starting with a "vigilant doctor" who actively develops the capability or framework to recognize potential FH patients, continuing with an "FH specialist", and finally involving the patient himself as "FH ambassador" to approach his/her family and facilitate cascade screening and subsequent treatment of relatives.

ID DISEASE
AB Familial hypercholesterolaemia (FH) is an autosomal-dominant disorder associated with high low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). Left untreated, 50% of men with FH will develop coronary heart disease by the age of 50 and 30% of women by the age 60 [1,2]. It is estimated that the prevalence may be as high as one in 250 people, with most undiagnosed.
   This article explores the development of advocacy in FH patient organisations, citing examples from Canada, the Netherlands, Spain, the US and the UK as well as the pan-European patient organisation, FH Europe. The article demonstrates that for patient advocacy, the link with medical and scientific expertise is essential to ensure that advocacy for familial hypercholesterolaemia is well-founded and credible and that patient associations are prepared to take a long-term view on achieving improvements in identification and treatment.

AB Background and aims: Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is arguably the most common monogenic disorder in humans, but severely under-diagnosed. Individuals with untreated FH have an over 10-fold elevated risk of cardiovascular complications as compared to unaffected individuals; early diagnosis and timely management substantially reduce this risk. Slovenia has gradually implemented the program of universal FH screening in pre-school children, consisting of a two step approach: (1) universal hypercholesterolemia screening in pre-school children at the primary care level; (2) genetic FH screening in children referred to the tertiary care level according to clinical guidelines (with additional cascade screening of family members). The program is presented in detail.
   Methods: We analyzed retrospective data (2012-2016), to assess the efficiency of the universal FH screening program. In that period, 280 children (59.3% female) were referred to our center through the program for having TC > 6 mmol/L (231.7 mg/dL) or > 5 mmol/L (193.1mg/dL), with a positive family history of premature cardiovascular complications at the universal hypercholesterolemia screening.
   Results: 170 (57.1% female) of them were fully genotyped, 44.7% had an FH disease-causing variant (28.8% in LDLR gene, 15.9% in APOB, none in PCSK9), one patient was LIPA positive, and 40.9% of the remaining patients carried an ApoE4 isoform; genetic analysis is still ongoing for one-third of the referred patients. For almost every child with confirmed FH, one parent had highly probable FH.
   Conclusions: FH was confirmed in almost half of the referred children, detected through the universal screening for hypercholesterolemia. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Background and aims: Familial hypercholesterolaemia has not been previously described in the Vietnamese population. We aimed to describe the features of patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia (hoFH) in Vietnam and the outcomes of screening family members using genetic and cholesterol testing.
   Methods: Mutation testing by massively parallel sequencing for genes causative of FH was undertaken in five index cases presenting to a single cardiac center with a presumptive diagnosis of hoFH. Cascade testing of all available family members was subsequently undertaken. The number of new cases of FH detected and commenced on lipid-lowering treatment was evaluated.
   Results: All five index cases had true homozygous mutations in the LDL receptor gene (LDLR). Cascade screening was undertaken in four families. 107 relatives were screened and FH was identified in 56 relatives (52%), including 3 new cases of hoFH. Only 5 FH relatives (9%) were subsequently treated owing to the adverse perceptions and comparative high cost of drug treatment, and lack of awareness of FH among patients and local doctors.
   Conclusions: HoFH due to LDLR mutations is a severe disorder in Vietnam that needs early detection and treatment with LDL-cholesterol lowering drugs. Cascade testing of families allows effective detection of new cases of FH that may also benefit from early treatment. However, convincing patients to commence statin treatment is a challenge. Extended education and awareness programs and treatment subsidies are imperative to improve the care of patients and families suffering from FH in Vietnam.

AB Fifty per cent of first-degree relatives of index cases with familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) inherit the disorder. Despite cascade screening being the most cost-effective method for detecting new cases, only a minority of individuals with FH are currently identified. Primary care is a key target area to increase identification of new index cases and initiate cascade screening, thereby finding close relatives of all probands. Increasing public and health professional awareness about FH is essential.
   In the United Kingdom and in Australia, most of the population are reviewed by a General Practitioner (GP) at least once over a three-year period, offering opportunities to check for FH as part of routine clinical consultations. Such opportunistic approaches can be supplemented by systematically searching electronic health records with information technology tools that identify high risk patients. GPs can help investigate and implement results of this data retrieval.
   Current evidence suggests that early detection of FH and cascade testing meet most of the criteria for a worthwhile screening program. Among heterozygous patients the long latent period before the expected onset of coronary artery disease provides an opportunity for initiating effective drug and lifestyle changes. The greatest challenge for primary care is to implement an efficacious model of care that incorporates sustainable identification and management pathways.

AB Background and aims: Familial hypercholesterolaemia (FH) is a widely underdiagnosed genetic disorder characterized by severely elevated levels of serum cholesterol and associated with premature mortality. Screening programmes and registries have been established worldwide to find and monitor patients with FH. The aim of this paper was to describe the approaches currently applied to identify patients with possible FH in Lithuania.
   Methods: An electronic extraction tool was applied to the medical records of 92,373 subjects evaluated in primary care settings from 2009 to 2016, 1714 secondary prevention patients with early onset (< 50 years) coronary heart disease (CHD) treated in tertiary care hospital from 2005 to 2016 and high-risk subjects in specialized cardiovascular prevention units. The electronic databases were screened for likely FH phenotype, which was described simply as LDL-C >= 6.5 mmol/l.
   Results: Likely FH phenotype was observed in 1385 (1.5%) middle-aged Lithuanians, 290 (16.9%) people with premature CHD and 330 adults from high-risk subjects referred to specialized cardiovascular prevention units. A total of 2005 patients with likely phenotypic FH were included in the Lithuanian FH screening programme, covering about 15% of estimated FH cases in Lithuania.
   Conclusions: Screening for extremely elevated LDL-C levels in primary prevention database and additional enrolment of patients with premature CVD as well as high-risk subjects may be a valid way to set up a national FH screening programme. It is crucially important to identify and initiate the treatment of FH patients as early as possible to reduce high cardiovascular mortality in these patients. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

ID FAMILIAL HYPERCHOLESTEROLEMIA; DISEASE; RISK
AB Background and aims: Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is an inherited disorder characterized by high levels of blood cholesterol from birth and premature coronary heart disease. Thus, the identification of FH patients is crucial to prevent or delay the onset of cardiovascular events, and the availability of a tool helping with the diagnosis in the setting of general medicine is essential to improve FH patient identification.
   Methods: This study evaluated the performance of the Dutch Lipid Clinic Network (DLCN) score in FH patients enrolled in the LIPIGEN study, an Italian integrated network aimed at improving the identification of patients with genetic dyslipidaemias, including FH.
   Results: The DLCN score was applied on a sample of 1377 adults (mean age 42.9 +/- 14.2 years) with genetic diagnosis of FH, resulting in 28.5% of the sample classified as probable FH and 37.9% as classified definite FH. Among these subjects, 43.4% had at least one missing data out of 8, and about 10.0% had 4 missing data or more. When analyzed based on the type of missing data, a higher percentage of subjects with at least 1 missing data in the clinical history or physical examination was classified as possible FH (DLCN score 3-5). We also found that using real or estimated pre-treatment LDL-C levels may significantly modify the DLCN score.
   Conclusions: Although the DLCN score is a useful tool for physicians in the diagnosis of FH, it may be limited by the complexity to retrieve all the essential information, suggesting a crucial role of the clinical judgement in the identification of FH subjects.

AB Background and aims: Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is under-diagnosed and under-treated in most of the world, including Canada. National registries play a key role in identifying patients with FH, understanding gaps in care, and advancing the science of FH to better treat these patients.
   Methods: FH Canada has established a national registry across 19 academic sites acting as "hubs" in Canada to increase awareness and access to standard-of-care therapies.
   Results: To-date, more than 3000 patients with FH have been entered into a secure, web-based database. Early outcomes of this initiative include a greater understanding of treatment gaps for patients with FH in Canada, the development of a new, simplified Canadian definition of FH, and tools to aid in the diagnosis of FH, including imputation of baseline levels of LDL cholesterol.
   Conclusions: As the national registry expands in size and scope, further learning will emerge with ultimate benefit for the diagnosis and treatment of FH in Canada. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Background and aims: Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is a predominantly autosomal dominant hereditary disorder with significant potential for expansion of coronary artery disease.
   Methods: To identify candidate variant/s in FH phenotype implicated genes, next-generation sequencing was performed using a targeted customized gene panel.
   Results: We recognized a 45-year-old Saudi female FH patient with double variants in the LDLR [c. 1255 T > G, p.(Y419D)] and LDLRAP1 genes [c. 604_605delTCinsA, p.(S202Tfs*2)]. The proband was found to be homozygous for the LDLR variant and heterozygous for the LDLRAP1 variant. Three of the proband's children were found to be double heterozygous for the LDLR/LDLRAP1 gene variant. While her other three children were heterozygous for the same single LDLR variant. Both variants were not previously reported. The variants segregation pattern correlated with the clinical picture and with the patient's lipid profile. FH severity was greater in the proband while her children did not show any clinical manifestations. The missense variant p.(Y419D) was found to be deleterious and clinically significant based on prediction identified by PolyPhen-2 and Proven. Molecular dynamics simulation was used to further analyze the effect of the variant p.(Y419D) on the structure and function of the LDLR protein. The secondary structure was investigated, as well as the solvent accessibility and stabilizing residues. The frameshift variant of the LDLRAP1 gene results in a truncated peptide that could affect the cellular internalization of LDLR/LDL complex.
   Conclusions: The finding of the combined variants in LDLR/LDLRAP1 genes triggering a severe FH phenotype is essential to elaborate the spectrum of variants causing FH and to understand the genotypephenotype correlation. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Background and aims: Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is characterized by elevated serum cholesterol levels due to high low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels. FH is an autosomal dominant genetic disorder and one of the most common dominant hereditary diseases in the world. However, the frequency of mutations in Colombia is unknown. The purpose of this preliminary study was to identify mutations in the LDL receptor (LDLR) gene in a Colombian population with FH.
   Methods: The study included 24 families with clinical diagnosis of sure/probable FH. The 18 exons of the LDLR were sequenced by Sanger method.
   Results: Among 18 variants identified, 3 were known pathogenic mutations and were identified in nine individuals in five unrelated families. Five affected individuals were heterozygous for one mutation each. They were the p. W4X in two, the p. D139G in two and the p. G396D in one. Two affected individuals were homozygous for p. G396D. The variant c.1187-1G > T, which has uncertain significance in FH pathogenesis, was present in all the individuals with the p. D139G mutation.
   Conclusions: In total, 18 variants were identified, of which 14 correspond to known nonpathogenic variants. Three pathogenic variants were identified in the LDLR. No pathological mutations were identified in the LDLR in 79% of the study population.

AB Background and aims: Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is an autosomal dominant disorder with paramount health impacts. However, less than 1% FH patients in Taiwan were formally diagnosed, partly due to the lack of reliable cost-effective genetic testing. We aimed at using a next-generation sequencing (NGS) platform as the clinical genetic testing method for FH.
   Methods: We designed probes to capture the whole LDLR gene and all coding sequences of APOB and PCSK9, and then sequenced with Illumina MiSeq platform (2x300 bps). The entire pipeline was tested on 13 DNA samples with known causative variants (including 3 large duplications and 2 large deletions). Then we enrolled a new cohort of 28 unrelated FH patients with Dutch Lipid Clinic Network score >= 5. Relatives were included in the cascade screening.
   Results: From the 13 DNA samples, we correctly identify all the variants, including big duplications and deletions. From the new cohort, we identified the causative variants in 21 of the 28 unrelated probands; five of them carrying a novel splice site variant c.1186+2T>G in LDLR. Among the family members, the concentration of LDL cholesterol was 7.82 +/- 2.13 mmol/l in LDLR c. 1186+2T>G carrier group (n=26), and was significantly higher than 3.18 +/- 1.36 mmol/l in the non-carrier group (n = 25).
   Conclusions: This is the first capture-based NGS testing for FH to cover the whole LDLR genomic region, and therefore making reliable structural variation detection. This panel can comprehensively detect disease-causing variants in LDLR, APOB, and PCSK9 for FH patients.

AB Background amd aims: APOB mutations are a rare cause of familial hypercholesterolaemia (FH) and, until recently, routine genetic diagnosis only included the study of two small APOB fragments. In previous years, 5 novel functional mutations have been described in APOB fragments not routinely studied, our group having functionally characterized 2 of them. The main aim of this work was to identify and characterize novel alterations in APOB to assess the genetic cause of hypercholesterolemia in patients with a clinical diagnosis of FH.
   Methods: We performed next generation sequencing of 48 Portuguese clinical FH patients, who were apparently mutation negative. All variants found in APOB were annotated. For functional studies, LDL from index patients and relatives was separated and marked with FITC- LDL for flow cytometry assays in lymphocytes and U937 growth assays.
   Results: A total of 11 potential pathogenic variants were identified. Variants p.(Pro994Leu) and p.(Thr3826Met) in exons 19 and 26 were found in 4 patients, and in vitro analysis was performed for these variants. An exon 26 alteration (p.(Thr3826Met)) showed a decrease in binding and internalization of LDL, and in U937 growth assays that was similar to the effect with p.(Arg3527Gln). An alteration in exon 19 had a neutral effect.
   Conclusions: The spectrum of functional alterations in APOB outside the fragments routinely screened is slowly growing. Screening of all 29 exons of APOB is advised for FH routine diagnosis, but functional characterization is necessary for pathogenicity assessment. It is expected that the number of patients with functional APOB mutations will increase in the near future. (c) 2018 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Background and aims: The aim of this study is to investigate the relation between lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] and proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) concentrations, and their complex, in patients with potential familial hypercholesterolemia (FH), depending on apo(a) phenotype.
   Methods: The study included 205 patients with total cholesterol (TC) > 7.5 mmol/L and/or low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C)> 4.9 mmol/L, 32 (15%) patients suffered from ischemic heart disease (IHD), 64 were taking statins. The diagnosis of FH was estimated according to the Dutch Lipid Clinics Network criteria. Lipid parameters, apoB-containing lipoprotein subfractions, Lp(a), PCSK9, Lp(a)-PCSK9 complex levels and apo (a) phenotype were determined. Depending on the apo(a) phenotype, all patients were divided into 2 groups: with high molecular weight (HMW) (n=145) and low molecular weight (LMW) (n=60) apo(a) phenotype.
   Results: The groups were comparable by all major clinical characteristics and biochemical parameters. In the whole group, PCSK9 concentration correlated with age, statins intake, Lp(a), TC and TG levels. Correlation between Lp(a) and PCSK9 levels was found only in the LMW apo(a) phenotype group independently of statins intake (r=0.46, p < 0.001). Associations between Lp(a)-PCSK9 complex and large subfractions of intermediate (r=0.30) and low-density lipoproteins (r=0.30, p < 0.05 for both) were observed, with more significance in group 2 (r=0.59, p < 0.005 and r=0.40, p < 0.05, respectively).
   Conclusions: In patients with potential familial hypercholesterolemia, positive correlations between concentrations of Lp(a) and PCSK9, as well as of Lp(a)-PCSK9 plasma complex with large subfractions of intermediate and low-density lipoproteins (IDL-1 and LDL-C), were determined by the LMW apo(a) phenotype.

AB Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is a genetic disorder resulting from mutations in genes encoding proteins involved in the metabolism of low density lipoproteins (LDL) and characterized by premature cardiovascular disease due to the exposure to high levels of LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C) from birth. Thus, the early identification of FH subjects, followed by appropriate treatment is essential to prevent or at least delay the onset of cardiovascular events. However, FH is largely underdiagnosed; in addition, FH patients are frequently not adequately treated, despite the availability of several pharmacological therapies to significantly reduce LDL-C levels. Current guidelines recommend LDL-C targets for FH (either heterozygotes [HeFH] or homozygotes [HoFH]) <100 mg/dL (<2.6 mmol/L) for adults or <70 mg/dL (<1.8 mmol/ L) for adults with CHD or diabetes, and <135mg/dL (<3.5 mmol/L) for children. With the pharmacological options now available, which include statins as a first approach, ezetimibe, and the recently approved monoclonal antibodies targeting PCSK9, the guideline recommended LDL-C target levels can be achieved in the majority of heterozygous FH subjects, while for the most severe forms of homozygous FH, the addition of therapies such as lomitapide either with or without apheresis may be required.

AB Background and aims: Pregnancy in HoFH females is associated with further elevation of already markedly elevated low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels, particularly if lipid-lowering therapy is discontinued, placing the mother and fetus at increased cardiovascular risk. Lipoprotein apheresis is the current recommended treatment for pregnant HoFH patients. However, this is costly, time consuming, and is not available in many countries. Alternative treatment strategies to control hypercholesterolaemia during pregnancy in HoFH patients are necessary.
   Methods: This study was a retrospective review of 39 pregnancies from a cohort of 20 genotypically confirmed female HoFH patients.
   Results: No maternal cardiac complications or deaths occurred during the pregnancies or during the first year postpartum. Twenty five pregnancies were exposed to lipid-lowering therapy, of which 18 were exposed to statin therapy, just prior to or during the pregnancy. Thirty three (84%) pregnancies carried to term, 3 (8%) premature deliveries and 3 (8%) miscarriages were observed. Complications associated with pregnancy in these HoFH patients, did not differ from those reported during pregnancies of otherwise healthy woman.
   Conclusions: HoFH is a severe disease impacting significantly on life expectancy. However, for many females with HoFH, despite the high cardiovascular risk, pregnancy is not uncommon. In resource poor settings and when LA is not available, lipid lowering therapy, particularly statin therapy during pregnancy, appears to be safe for both mother and fetus and is an acceptable alternative for LDL-C reduction in these high risk patients.

AB Background and aims: This study aimed to determine knowledge, awareness and practice (KAP) regarding familial hypercholesterolaemia (FH) among Malaysian primary care physicians (PCP), and to compare KAP between PCP with postgraduate qualification (PCP-PG-Qual) and PCP without PG qualification (PCP-noPG-Qual).
   Methods: This was a cross-sectional study involving PCP with >= 1-year working experience in Malaysian primary care settings. An adapted and validated 25-item FH-KAP questionnaire was disseminated during primary care courses. Total score for each domain was calculated by summing-up the correct responses, converted into percentage scores. Normality distribution was examined and comparisons of mean/median percentage scores were made between the two groups of PCP.
   Results: A total of 372 PCP completed the questionnaire. Regarding knowledge, 77.7% correctly defined FH. However, only 8.3% correctly identified coronary artery disease risk in untreated FH. The mean percentage knowledge score was significantly higher in PCP-PG-Qual compared to PCP-noPG-Qual (48.9, SD +/- 13.92 vs. 35.2, SD +/- 14.13), t(370)= 8.66, p < 0.001. Regarding awareness, 39% were aware of the NICE FH guideline and only 27.2% were aware of FH diagnostic criteria. The median percentage awareness score was significantly higher in PCP-PG-Qual compared to PCP-noPG-Qual (15.4, IqR +/- 23.08 vs. 7.7, IqR +/- 11.54), p = 0.013. Regarding practice, only 19.1% stratified FH patients as high risk irrespective of other risk factors. The mean percentage practice score was significantly higher in PCP-PG-Qual compared to PCP-noPG-Qual (52.4, SD +/- 12.92 vs. 42.7, SD +/- 16.63), t(370) = 9.65, p < 0.001.
   Conclusions: Substantial gaps in FH-KAP among Malaysian PCP were identified, with PCP-PG-Qual having better knowledge, awareness and practice than PCP-noPG-Qual, emphasising the importance of professional training and certification.

   DESIGN; NORWAY; RISK; UK
AB Background and aims: In Mexico, familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is, as in other parts of the world, largely underdiagnosed and undertreated, and represents a significant burden to the healthcare system. However, there is not enough information to design public policies against the disease. Genetic studies have shown that LDLR mutations are the most common cause, but in a large percentage of the cases, no mutation has been identified in the FH genes.
   Methods: In accordance with the procedures of the European Atherosclerosis Society (EAS) FH registries network, the Mexican FH registry (www.fhmexico.org.mx) was launched in December 2017 to address the gaps in knowledge regarding this disease. Reference centres and the main nationwide public health providers have been invited to participate.
   Results: To date, 142 cases have been registered. The mean age at diagnosis of probands is 36.42 +/- 19.9 years (adults and children). Tendon xanthomas or premature corneal arcus were present in 40% and 17.6%, respectively. Molecular analysis was present in 70%, with over 95% of alterations located on the LDL receptor gene. The median untreated LDL-C is 6.5 (5.6-8.4) mmol/l and the median on treatment LDL-C level is 4.3 +/- 1.7 mmol/l.
   Conclusions: The Mexican FH registry aims to obtain real world information regarding the management of patients in this country. By participating in this global call to action, we hope to improve both short and long term outcomes for all FH patients in Mexico. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Background and aims: We aimed to assess the disease burden and to study the molecular genetic characteristics of heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HeFH) patients within the Uzbek population to develop a program of early disease detection and effective treatment measures.
   Methods: 201 patients were included in the study, of whom 57 with chronic stable coronary artery disease (SCAD) and HeFH, and 144 with SCAD without HeFH belonging to the control group, and divided into two subgroups: A, statin free before the study (n=63) and B (n=81), who took statin outpatiently. We applied the Dutch Lipid Clinic Network Criteria (DLCN) to diagnose HeFH. Serum level of PCSK-9 was measured with the ELISA Kit. The genetic typing at PCSK9 E670G (rs505151) polymorphism was performed with the PCR-RFLP method.
   Results: Underestimation of early lipid studies and inadequate treatment in HeHF patients within the Uzbek population are accompanied by a 1.8-time increase of more frequent history of myocardial infarction (p < 0.05), a 3-time stroke (p < 0.05) and 2-time percutaneous coronary intervention (p < 0.05). The study of genotypes and alleles of PCSK9 E670G (rs505151) polymorphism allowed to state that.arriage of the "damaging" allele G in SCAD and HeHF patients was 2 times higher (11.4%), than in non HeHF (6.0%) and 3 times (3.0%) than in healthy ones, but the differences were not significant. Herewith, G-carriership is accompanied by a higher incidence of myocardial infarction (p < 0.05) and stroke (p < 0.05), coronary artery bypass grafting in anamnesis (p < 0.001), and number of plaques in carotids (p < 0.05). In group I of SCAD patients with HeFH, 18 (31.6%) cases of diabetes mellitus were observed, which did not exceed their number in group II (48, 33.3%). However, most of them were carriers of the G allele (82.0%, p < 0.001). Despite treatment with rosuvastatin 20-40 mg/day, in HeHF patients after 3 months, the level of total cholesterol (p < 0.001) and LDL-C (p < 0.001) was significantly higher than in the control group.
   Conclusions: Improvement of early diagnosis of FH, including genetic confirmation, and preventional high-intensity statin therapy or a combination of statins with ezetimibe to achieve the target level of LDL-C, is the closest tactical objective for prevention of MACE within the Uzbek population.

AB Background and aims: Although genetic and epidemiological studies support that people with high lipoprotein (a) [Lp(a)] levels are at an increased risk for arterial disease, its prognostic value in patients with established artery disease has not been consistently evaluated.
   Methods: FRENA is a prospective registry of consecutive outpatients with coronary, cerebrovascular or peripheral artery disease. We assessed the risk for subsequent myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke or limb amputation according to Lp(a) levels at baseline.
   Results: As of December 2016, 1503 stable outpatients were recruited. Of these, 814 (54%) had levels <30 mg/dL, 319 (21%) had 30-50 mg/dL and 370 (25%) had >= 50 mg/dL. Over a mean follow-up of 36 months, 294 patients developed subsequent events (myocardial infarction 122, ischemic stroke 114, limb amputation 58) and 85 died. On multivariable analysis, patients with Lp(a) levels of 30-50 mg/dL were at a higher risk for myocardial infarction (hazard ratio [HR]: 4.67; 95% CI: 2.77-7.85), ischemic stroke (HR: 8.27; 95% CI: 4.14-16.5) or limb amputation (HR: 3.18; 95% CI: 1.36-7.44) than those with normal levels. Moreover, patients with levels >= 50 mg/dL were at increased risk for myocardial infarction (HR: 19.5; 95% CI: 10.5-36.1), ischemic stroke (HR: 54.5; 95% CI: 25.4-116.7) or limb amputation (HR: 22.7; 95% CI: 9.38-54.9).
   Conclusions: Stable outpatients with symptomatic artery disease and Lp(a) levels >30 mg/dL were at a 5-fold higher risk for subsequent myocardial infarction, stroke or limb amputation. Those with levels >50 mg/dL were at an over 10-fold higher risk. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Background and aims: Arterial remodelling aims at normalising circumferential wall stress (CWS). Greater CWS in the carotid artery has previously been associated with the prevalence and severity of cerebral small vessel disease, a major cause of ageing-related cognitive decline. Here we test the hypothesis that greater carotid CWS is associated with poorer cognitive performance.
   Methods: We studied 722 individuals (60 +/- 8 years, 55% men, 42.5% highly educated, blood pressure 137 +/- 19/77 +/- 11 mmHg, n = 197 with type 2 diabetes) who completed a neuropsychological assessment and underwent vascular ultrasound to measure the intima-media thickness (IMT) and interadventitial diameter (IAD) of the left common carotid artery at a plaque-free site. From IMT and IAD, lumen diameter (LD) was calculated. These structural measures were then combined with local carotid pulse pressure and brachial mean arterial pressure to obtain a measure of pulsatile (CWSpulsatile) and average (CWSmean) mechanical load on the vessel wall. Cognitive domains assessed were memory, executive function and attention, and processing speed.
   Results: After adjustment for age, sex, and education, regression analyses showed that neither CWSpulsatile nor CWSmean were associated with measures of cognitive performance (p-values >= 0.31). This null association did not differ by age or educational level, and was observed in both individuals with and without carotid plaque, diabetes and/or hypertension. In addition, none of the individual measures of carotid structure (i.e. IMT, IAD, and LD) was related to cognitive performance.
   Conclusions: The present cross-sectional study shows that carotid CWS is not associated with cognitive performance, at least not among relatively highly educated individuals in late middle age with adequately controlled cardiovascular risk factors.

AB Background and aims: We investigated the association between Dietary Inflammatory Index (DII (R)) scores and cardio-metabolic risk factors singly and in combination as metabolic syndrome (MetS).
   Methods: We used data from participants selected from the US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). Analyses were restricted to participants with data available on dietary intake, biochemical data, and anthropometric measurements from 2005 to 2012. Statistical analyses used the SPSS (R) Complex Samples v22.0 (IBM Corp, Armonk, NY) and accounted for the survey design and sample weights. Energy-adjusted-DII (E-DII (R)) expressed per 1000 kcal was calculated from 24-h dietary recalls. Of the 17,689 participants with evaluable data, 8607 (48.3%) were men. The mean age was 45.8 years in the overall sample, with men being slightly younger than women (44.9 vs. 46.5 years, p = 0.05).
   Results: In multivariable-adjusted regression models, the odds of MetS, its components, as well as obesity, and elevated high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) increased across increasing quartiles of E-DII (p < 0.001). In age, sex, race, income-to-poverty ratio-adjusted models, these and other cardiovascular disease risk factors (triglycerides/high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) ratio, apolipoprotein (B) and HbA1C) increased across quartiles of the E-DII (all p < 0.001), while HDL-C levels decreased (p < 0.001).
   Conclusions: This study suggests associations between MetS, its components, subclinical inflammation, and the DII. These results reinforce the view that diet plays an important role in the occurrence of cardiovascular diseases. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Background and aims: Angiotensin II (Ang II) infusion promotes the development of aortic aneurysms and accelerates atherosclerosis in ApoE(-/-) mice. In order to elucidate the role of hematopoietic cells in these pathologies, irradiation and bone marrow transplantation (BMT) are commonly utilized. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of irradiation and BMT on abdominal and thoracic aortic aneurysm formation and acute leukocyte recruitment in the aortic root and descending aorta, in an experimental mouse model of aortic aneurysm formation.
   Methods: ApoE(-/-) mice were either lethally irradiated and reconstituted with ApoE(-/-) bone marrow or non-irradiated. Following engraftment, mice were treated with Ang II to induce aortic inflammation and accelerate atherosclerosis.
   Results: Ang II infusion (0.8 mg/kg/day) in BMT mice resulted in reduced aortic aneurysms and atherosclerosis with decreased leukocyte infiltration in the aorta compared to non-BMT mice, when receiving the same dose of Ang II. Furthermore, the reduced aortic infiltration in BMT mice was accompanied by increased levels of monocytes in the spleen and bone marrow. A dose of 3 mg/kg/day Ang II was required to achieve a similar incidence of aneurysm formation as achieved with 0.8 mg/kg/day in non-BMT mice.
   Conclusions: This study provides evidence that BMT can alter inflammatory cell recruitment in experimental mouse models of aortic aneurysm formation and atherosclerosis and suggests that irradiation and BMT have a considerably more complex effect on vascular inflammation, which should be evaluated.

AB C1q tumor necrosis factor-related protein 9 (CTRP9), a newly discovered adipokine, is the closest paralog of adiponectin. After proteolytic cleavage, it can release the globular domain (gCTRP9) that serves as the major circulatory isoform. Upon binding to adiponectin receptor 1 (AdipoR1) and N-cadherin, CTRP9 can activate a variety of signaling pathways to regulate glucose and lipid metabolism, vascular relaxation and cell differentiation. Circulating CTRP9 levels are significantly decreased in patients with coronary atherosclerosis disease. Data obtained from in vitro experiments and animal models suggest that CTRP9 exerts an atheroprotective effect by altering multiple pathological processes involved in atherosclerosis, including inflammation, foam cell formation, endothelial dysfunction, insulin resistance, and vascular smooth muscle cell dedifferentiation, proliferation and migration. In this review, we summarize the latest advances regarding the roles of CTRP9 in atherosclerosis with an emphasis on its potential as a novel therapeutic target in cardiovascular disease.

AB Exertional lower limb pain is a frequent diagnostic issue in elderly patients. Arterial claudication results from the mismatch between the oxygen requirement of, and oxygen delivery to the exercising muscles. Non-invasive vascular investigations (ultrasound imaging, plethysmography or segmental pressure) are used in routine at rest or following exercise, but none can be used during walking or to directly monitor cutaneous oxygen delivery to the limb. Here, we review the methods, tips and traps of the transcutaneous oxygen pressure measurement technique and potential applications.
   Transcutaneous oxygen pressure measurement is largely used in vascular medicine for patients with critical limb ischemia. It can also detect regional blood flow impairment at the proximal and distal limb simultaneously and bilaterally during exercise. Exercise-oximetry can also analyze systemic oxygen pressure changes on a reference area on the chest, to screen for occult pulmonary disease. As a surface technique, it does not directly measure muscle oxygen content but provides a reliable estimation of regional blood flow impairment.
   With the use of a recently reported index that is independent of the unknown transcutaneous gradient for oxygen, exercise-oximetry provides some accurate information compared to classical non-invasive vascular investigations to argue for a vascular or non-vascular origin of exertional lower limb pain during exercise. Although a time consuming technique, it is a simple test and it is progressively spreading among referral vascular centers as a useful non-invasive diagnostic tool for patients suspected of arterial claudication.

AB Background and aims: Lecithin: cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT), a key enzyme in high-density lipoprotein (HDL) metabolism and reverse cholesterol transport (RCT), has been associated with atheroprotection. However, its relation to plaque characteristics has not been confirmed to date. We aimed to determine the relationship between plasma LCAT mass concentration and plaque burden in a multicenter imaging study.
   Methods: Two hundred sixty-seven patients with angiographically proven coronary artery disease (CAD) underwent intravascular ultrasonography (IVUS) imaging. Ninety-six patients without CAD served as controls for biochemistry assessments.
   Results: Plasma LCAT mass concentration was higher in CAD patients as compared to controls (8.94 +/- 2.51 mu g/mL vs. 7.89 +/- 2.99 mu g/mL, p = 0.003), while cholesterol esterification rate (CER) was downregulated (253.6 +/- 83.9 mu M/2 h vs. 315.3 +/- 115.0 mu M/2 h, p<0.0001). Both parameters correlated inversely with total atheroma volume (r = -0.14, p = 0.027 and r = -0.14, p = 0.024, respectively), while only LCAT mass was found to be a significant predictor of atheroma volume (beta-coefficient -0.18, p = 0.0047) when tested in a stepwise linear regression model against known CAD risk factors as predictor variables. Accordingly, patients with LCAT mass in the highest quartile had significantly less atheroma burden than those in the lower quartiles (39.7 +/- 10.7% vs. 45.4 +/- 10.4%, p = 0.0014 for highest vs. lowest quartile of LCAT mass).
   Conclusions: Plasma LCAT mass concentration is upregulated in CAD patients and inversely related to plaque volume, suggesting atheroprotective effects. LCAT mass concentration outperformed LCAT activity in risk prediction models for atheroma burden, suggesting that LCAT mass is a key variable in atheroprotection. Further studies assessing LCAT as a therapeutic target in cardiovascular disease are warranted. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Background and aims: Preclinical experiments on animal models are essential to understand the mechanisms of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Metabolomics allows access to the metabolic perturbations associated with CVD in heart and vessels. Here we assessed which potential animal CVD model most closely mimics the serum metabolite signature of increased carotid intima-media thickness (cIMT) in humans, a clinical parameter widely accepted as a surrogate of CVD.
   Methods: A targeted mass spectrometry assay was used to quantify and compare a series of blood metabolites between 1362 individuals (KORA F4 cohort) and 5 animal CVD models: ApoE(-/-), Ldlr(-/-), and klotho-hypomorphic mice (kl/kl) and SHRSP rats with or without salt feeding. The metabolite signatures were obtained using linear regressions adjusted for various co-variates.
   Results: In human, increased cIMT [quartile Q4 vs. Q1] was associated with 26 metabolites (9 acylcarnitines, 2 lysophosphatidylcholines, 9 phosphatidylcholines and 6 sphingomyelins). Acylcarnitines correlated preferentially with serum glucose and creatinine. Phospholipids correlated preferentially with cholesterol (total and LDL). The human signature correlated positively and significantly with Ldlr(-/-) and ApoE(-/-) mice, while correlation with kl/kl mice and SHRP rats was either negative and non-significant. Human and Ldlr(-/-) mice shared 11 significant metabolites displaying the same direction of regulation: 5 phosphatidylcholines, 1 lysophosphatidylcholines, 5 sphingomyelins; ApoE(-/-) mice shared 10.
   Conclusions: The human cIMT signature was partially mimicked by Ldlr(-/-) and ApoE(-/-) mice. These animal models might help better understand the biochemical and molecular mechanisms involved in the vessel metabolic perturbations associated with, and contributing to metabolic disorders in CVD.

AB Background and aims: Increased oxidative stress is associated with accelerated atherosclerosis. Emerging evidence highlights the role of heparanase in atherogenesis, where heparanase inhibitor PG545 reduces oxidative stress in apolipoprotein E deficient mice (E-0 mice). Herein, we studied the effects of PG545 on atherosclerosis progression in E-0 mice.
   Methods: Male E-0 mice fed a high-fat diet (n = 20) were divided into 3 groups treated with weekly intraperitoneal injections of either low (0.2 mg/mouse) or high dose (0.4 mg/mouse) PG545 or normal saline (controls) for twelve weeks. Body weight and food intake were measured weekly. At the end of the treatment period, blood pressure was measured, animals were sacrificed and serum samples were collected and assessed for biochemical parameters and oxidative stress. Aortic vessels and livers were collected for atherosclerotic plaques and histopathological analysis, respectively.
   Results: Blood pressure decreased in mice treated with low, but not high dose of PG545. In addition, heparanase inhibition caused a dose-dependent reduction in serum oxidative stress, total cholesterol, low-density lipoproteins, triglycerides, high-density lipoproteins, and aryl esterase activity. Although food intake was not reduced by PG545, body weight gain was significantly attenuated in PG545 treated groups. Both doses of PG545 caused a marked reduction in aortic wall thickness and atherosclerosis development, and liver steatosis. Liver enzymes and serum creatinine were not affected by PG545.
   Conclusions: Heparanase inhibition by PG545 caused a significant reduction in lipid profile and serum oxidative stress along with attenuation of atherosclerosis, aortic wall thickness, and liver steatosis. Moreover, PG545 attenuated weight gain without reducing food intake. Collectively, these findings suggest that heparanase blockade is highly effective in slowing atherosclerosis formation and progression, and decreasing liver steatosis. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB Background and aims: Pre-eclampsia constitutes a leading cause of maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality. Pre-eclampsia susceptibility is believed to be associated with altered lipid profiles and abnormal lipid metabolism via lipid peroxidation that leads to endothelial dysfunction. The goal of this study was to evaluate the association of maternal blood lipid and apolipoprotein levels with pre-eclampsia in a large-scale study.
   Methods: Using data from a large case-control study (1366 cases of pre-eclampsia and 1741 normotensive controls), the association between the distributions of eight lipid fractions and pre-eclampsia risk was evaluated using adjusted logistic regression models. Pre-eclampsia was defined as blood pressure >= 140/90 mmHg and proteinuria >= 300 mg/24 h (>1 + dipstick). Sub-group analyses were conducted for early (<34 weeks) and late (>= 37 weeks) pre-eclampsia, estimating the effect of 1 standard deviation increase in log-transformed lipid fraction levels in adjusted multinomial regression models.
   Results: After adjustment for potential confounders, concentrations of triglycerides, apolipoprotein E (ApoE) and the relationship between apolipoprotein B and A1 (ApoB/ApoA1) showed the strongest associations with pre-eclampsia, particularly for those cases with an early onset.
   Conclusions: Higher levels of triglycerides, ApoE and the ApoB/ApoA1 ratio are associated with an increased risk of pre-eclampsia. Further studies that allow for a causal inference are needed to confirm or refute the aetiological role of blood lipids in pre-eclampsia. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Cardiovascular disease remains the leading cause of death worldwide with coronary atherosclerotic heart disease being the largest contributor. The mechanisms behind the presence and progression of atherosclerosis remain an area of intense scientific focus. Immune dysregulation and inflammation are key contributors to the development of an atherosclerotic plaque and its progression to acute coronary syndromes. Increased circulating levels of biomarkers of systemic inflammation including hsCRP are correlated with a higher cardiovascular risk. Targeting specific inflammatory pathways implicated in atherosclerotic plaque formation is an exciting area of ongoing research. Target specific therapies directed at pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1 beta, IL-6, TNF alpha, and CCL2 have demonstrated slowing in the progression of atherosclerosis in animal models and improved cardiovascular outcomes in human subjects. Most notably, treatment with the monoclonal antibody canakinumab, which directly targets and neutralizes IL-1 beta, was recently shown to be associated with reduced risk of adverse cardiovascular events compared to placebo in a randomized, placebo-controlled trial. Several other therapies including colchicine, methotrexate and leukotriene inhibitors demonstrate the potential for lowering cardiovascular risk through immunomodulation, though further studies are needed. Understanding the role of inflammation in atherosclerosis and the development of targeted immunotherapies continues to be an evolving area of research that is rapidly becoming clinically relevant for the 21st century cardiac patient.

AB Background and aims: Induction of low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) plays a significant role in reduction of plasma LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C) levels. Therefore, strategies that enhance the protein level of LDLR provide an attractive therapeutic target for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia. With this aim in mind, we concentrated our effort on studying the role of AKT kinase in regulation of LDLR levels and proceeded to examine the effect of MK-2206, an allosteric and highly selective AKT inhibitor, on LDLR expression.
   Methods: Cultured human hepatoma cells were used to examine the effect of MK-2206 on the proteolytic processing of sterol regulatory element-binding protein-2 (SREBP-2), the expression of LDLR and cellular internalization of LDL. We also examined the effect of MK-2206 on LDLR levels in primary human hepatocytes.
   Results: MK-2206 induced the proteolytic processing of SREBP-2, upregulated LDLR expression and stimulated LDL uptake. In contrast to statins, induction of LDLR levels by MK-2206 did not rely on 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase (HMGCR) inhibition. As a result, cotreatment of cells with MK-2206 and mevastatin potentiated the impact of mevastatin on LDLR. Importantly, MK-2206 stimulated the expression of LDLR by primary human hepatocytes.
   Conclusions: MK-2206 is a novel LDLR-inducing agent that, either alone or in combination with statins, exerts a stimulating effect on cellular LDL uptake. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Plasma HDL levels have an inverse relationship to coronary artery disease (CAD) risk, which led to the idea that increasing HDL levels therapeutically would ameliorate atherosclerosis. Human genetic deficiency of CETP caused markedly elevated HDL and moderately reduced non-HDL cholesterol levels, suggesting that CETP inhibitors might produce cardiovascular benefit. The CETP inhibitor anacetrapib reproduced the phenotype of homozygous CETP deficiency and showed a highly significant benefit for CAD in the REVEAL trial. However, the magnitude of this effect was moderate, and the mechanism of benefit remains unclear. Insights into the mechanisms underlying macrophage cholesterol efflux and reverse cholesterol transport have come from monogenic human disorders and transgenic mouse studies. In particular, the importance of the ATP binding cassette transporters ABCA1 and ABCG1 in promoting cholesterol efflux from myeloid and other hematopoietic cells has been shown and linked to aberrant myelopoiesis and macrophage inflammation. Recent studies have shown that myeloid deficiency of ABCA1 and ABCG1 leads to macrophage and neutrophil inflammasome activation, which in turn promotes atherosclerotic plaque development and notably the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) in plaques. In addition, clonal hematopoiesis has emerged as an important CAD risk factor, likely involving macrophage inflammation and inflammasome activation. Further elucidation of the mechanisms linking plaque accumulation of cholesterol and oxidized lipids to myeloid cell inflammation may lead to the development of new therapeutics specifically targeting atherogenic inflammation, with likely benefit for CAD.

AB Background and aims: Calcifications of the intracranial internal carotid artery (iICA) are an important risk factor for stroke. The calcifications can occur both in the intimal and medial layer of the vascular wall. The aim of this study is to assess whether medial calcification in the iICA is differently related to risk factors for cardiovascular disease, compared to intimal calcification.
   Methods: Unenhanced thin slice computed tomography (CT) scans from 1132 patients from the Dutch acute stroke study cohort were assessed for dominant localization of calcification (medial or intimal) by one of three observers based on established methodology. Associations between known cardiovascular risk factors (age, gender, body mass index, pulse pressure, eGFR, smoking, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, previous vascular disease, and family history) and the dominant localization of calcifications were assessed via logistic regression analysis.
   Results: In the 1132 patients (57% males, mean age 67.4 years [SD 13.8]), dominant intimal calcification was present in 30.9% and dominant medial calcification in 46.9%. In 10.5%, no calcification was seen. Age, pulse pressure and family history were risk factors for both types of calcification. Multivariably adjusted risk factors for dominant intimal calcification only were smoking (OR 2.09 [CI 1.27-3.44]) and hypertension (OR 2.09 [CI 1.29-3.40])and for dominant medial calcification diabetes mellitus (OR 2.39 [CI 1.11-5.14]) and previous vascular disease (OR 2.20 [CI 1.30-3.75]).
   Conclusions: Risk factors are differently related to the dominant localizations of calcifications, a finding that supports the hypothesis that the intimal and medial calcification represents a distinct etiology.

AB Background and aims: Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and diabetes. Traditional cardiovascular risk factors fail to fully account for the increase in cardiovascular risk in these patients. This study aims to analyse the prevalence and progression of subclinical atherosclerosis in CKD patients with and without diabetes.
   Methods: We included data from CKD patients with and without diabetes free from previous cardiovascular events from the NEFRONA cohort. Patients underwent baseline and 24-month follow-up carotid and femoral ultrasound examinations. Multivariable models were used to assess the contribution of diabetes to the presence and plaque progression.
   Results: A total of 419 patients with diabetes and 1129 without diabetes were included. Diabetic patients were older, had higher BMIs, more hypertension and dyslipidaemia. At baseline, the proportion of patients with plaque was higher among diabetic patients (81.4% vs. 64.1%, p < 0.001). Diabetic patients more frequently had more than two vascular territories with plaque (64.4% vs. 48.4%, p < 0.001). Multivariable analysis indicated that plaque at baseline was significantly associated with age, gender, smoking and renal replacement therapy (RRT) in the non-diabetic patients, but only with age and male gender in diabetic patients. Plaque progression was significantly associated with age, number of territories with basal plaque, smoking and RRT in both groups.
   Conclusions: Subclinical atherosclerosis is more prevalent, carries a higher plaque burden and is more rapidly progressive in renal patients with diabetes. In these patients, diabetes outweighs other described risk factors associated with the presence of subclinical atherosclerosis. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Background and aims: The phenotype switching of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) plays a key role during development and progression of vascular remodeling diseases. Recent studies show that GLP-1 can inhibit intima thickening to delay the progression of atherosclerotic plaques. The purpose of this study was to investigate the role of Exendin-4, a GLP-1 receptor agonist, in VSMCs phenotype switching and the related mechanisms.
   Methods: Immunohistochemistry and Western blot were used to detect the effect of Exendin-4 on expression of markers of contractile VSMCs. Phalloidin staining was performed to observe the effect of Exendin-4 on morphology of VSMCs.
   Results: Exendin-4 significantly increased the protein levels of contractile VSMCs markers like Calponin and SM22 alpha. After treatment of Exendin-4, VSMCs showed more typical characteristic spindle shape. In addition, Exendin-4 significantly upregulated the phosphorylation of AMPK as well as the protein levels of Sirtuin1 (SIRT1) and FOXO3a in VSMCs. After inhibiting AMPK activity with compound C and SIRT1 activity with EX527, and knocking down FOXO3a expression through RNAi technique, Exendin-4 increased the protein levels of Calponin and SM22 alpha and promoted the redifferentiation of VSMCs mainly through AMPK/SIRT1/FOXO3a signaling pathways.
   Conclusions: Exendin-4 can regulate the phenotype switching of VSMCs and promote redifferentiation of VSMCs through AMPK/SIRT1/FOXO3a signaling pathways. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

   STROKE; PROGRESSION; AGE
AB Background and aims: The national representative prevalence of carotid atherosclerosis (CAS) or carotid plaque (CP) in the general Chinese population has never been estimated. We aim to generate the prevalence and number of people with CAS and CP in the general Chinese population.
   Methods: We searched China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Wanfang Data, VIP Database for Chinese Technical Periodical, PubMed, Embase and Medline. Articles reporting the prevalence of CAS or CP in the general Chinese population were included. A multilevel mixed-effects logistic regression was used to estimate the age-and gender-specific prevalence of CAS and CP. The effects of risk factors for CAS were assessed by a random-effects meta-analysis.
   Results: The prevalence of CAS and CP increased with advanced age. Males had a higher prevalence of CAS and CP than females consistently across all age groups. Overall, 27.22% and 20.15% of Chinese people aged 30-79 years were with CAS and CP, respectively, in 2010, equivalent to 207.73 million and 153.82 million affected individuals. With demographic ageing, the number of people affected by CAS and CP will increase to 267.25 million and 199.83 million, respectively, by 2020. In addition, current smoking, hypertension and diabetes were found to be risk factors for CAS. More than 70% of the national CAS cases were in rural China in 2010.
   Conclusions: CAS and CP are highly prevalent in China. The huge disease burden of CAS and CP calls for efforts on effective preventive health strategies and early-detection of CVDs in people with CAS or CP, especially in rural areas. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Background and aims: Type 2 diabetes is a global health problem that is associated with a wide variety of vascular complications and associated morbidity and mortality. Klotho is an enzyme and transmembrane protein, and increasing evidence suggests that Klotho may contribute to reduced oxidative stress, improved endothelial function, and vasoprotection. To date, the physiological role of Klotho in vascular complications associated with diabetes is unclear.
   Methods: We prospectively recruited 252 patients with type 2 diabetes, who visited an outpatient clinic at our hospital between 2009 and 2011. Patients in the top and bottom tertiles of circulating Klotho levels were enrolled for analysis.
   Results: Of the 168 patients enrolled, 45.8% were male, the mean age was 57.2 years, and the average duration of diabetes was 7.58 years. In multiple regression analysis, a high Klotho level was associated with a reduced risk of developing coronary artery disease and cerebrovascular accidents. Klotho level was also an independent predictor for the development of macroangiopathies within the 7-year study period.
   Conclusions: Our results suggest that circulating Klotho level is a predictor of long-term macrovascular outcomes in patients with type 2 diabetes. (c) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Background and aims: Mitochondrial DNA copy number (mtDNA-CN) depletion has been recently associated with an increased cardiovascular risk. However, the integrity of mtDNA is another key aspect of the energy metabolism and mitochondrial function. We investigated the prognostic role of peripheral blood common mitochondrial deletion (mtDNA(4977)) and mtDNA-CN on long-term major adverse cardiac events (MACEs) and all-cause mortality in a cohort of patients with coronary artery disease (CAD).
   Methods: Within the Italian GENOCOR (Genetic Mapping for Assessment of Cardiovascular Risk) cohort, we studied 515 patients (450 males, 65 +/- 8 years) with known or suspected stable CAD. mtDNA(4977) deletion and mtDNA-CN were assessed in peripheral blood using qRT-PCR.
   Results: During a mean follow-up of 4.5 +/- 1.1 years, 78 (15%) patients had MACEs (15 cardiac deaths, 17 nonfatal myocardial infarction and 46 coronary revascularizations) and 28 patients died for non-cardiac causes. Patients with high levels of mtDNA(4977) deletion (>75th) had increased risk of MACEs (log rank = 7.2, p = 0.007) and all-cause mortality (log rank = 5.7, p = 0.01) compared with patients with low mtDNA(4977) deletion (>75th). Multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that log mtDNA(4977) was a significant predictor of MACEs (HR = 2.17; 95% CI, 1.31-3.59; p = 0.003) and all-cause mortality (HR = 2.03; 95% CI: 1.13-3.65, p = 0.02). Log mtDNA-CN was not significantly associated with MACEs or all-cause mortality. However, patients with high mtDNA(4977) deletion (>75th) and low mtDNA-CN (<25th) had significantly increased risk for MACEs (HR: 3.73; 95% CI: 1.79-7.79; p = 0.0005).
   Conclusions: Mitochondria DNA damage was associated with an increased risk of MACEs and all-cause mortality in patients with stable CAD, confirming the critical role of mitochondrial dysfunction in atherosclerosis. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Rudolph Virchow (1821-1902)recognized inflammation in histological preparations of coronary arteries and proposed that inflammation plays a causal role in atherosclerosis. Despite this seminal observation, the main focus of research and drug development programs has been cholesterol alone, and inflammation received less attention over time. However, during the past several decades extensive observations supported the importance of inflammation in the development and destabilization of atherosclerosis. Studies in patients affected by rheumatological diseases suggested an interaction between chronic inflammation and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Randomized clinical studies with lipid lowering agents suggested that part of the beneficial effect may have been related to reduction in inflammation. More recently, a few studies were designed to directly address the role of anti-inflammatory treatments in reducing risk of atherosclerotic heart disease beyond traditional risk factors. In this article, we review the pathophysiologic contribution of inflammation to atherosclerosis, biomarkers of inflammation and the evidence collected in observational studies regarding the role of chronic inflammation in the development of atherosclerotic heart disease. Finally, we discuss the most recent randomized clinical trials of anti-inflammatory agents directed at stemming atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Background and aims: Alirocumab, a monoclonal antibody to proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9, significantly reduces low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). We evaluated the efficacy and safety of alirocumab in individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) with versus without mixed dyslipidaemia (MDL, defined as baseline LDL-C >= 70 mg/dL [1.8 mmol/L] and triglycerides >= 150mg/dL [1.7 mmol/L]).
   Methods: Data from 812 individuals with T2DM, from the placebo-controlled, 78-week, Phase 3 ODYSSEY LONG TERM trial of alirocumab 150mg every 2 weeks (Q2W), on a background of maximally tolerated statins +/- other lipid-lowering therapies, were pooled according to MDL status. Efficacy endpoints included percentage change from baseline to Week 24 in calculated LDL-C and other lipids/lipoproteins.
   Results: In individuals with T2DM who received alirocumab 150mg Q2W, mean LDL-C changes from baseline to Week 24 were -62.6% (vs. -6.0% with placebo) in those with MDL and -56.1% (vs. 5.6%) in those without MDL, with no significant between-group difference (p-interaction = 0.0842). Risk-based LDL-C goals (<70 [1.8 mmol/L] or <100 mg/dL [2.6 mmol/L]) were achieved by 69.1% and 72.4% of alirocumab-treated individuals with and without MDL, respectively. Mean reductions in non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (49.2% and 47.8%) and apolipoprotein B (50.2% and 49.1%) with alirocumab were also similar in those with and without MDL, respectively. Treatment-emergent adverse event rates were comparable between alirocumab-treated individuals with T2DM, with and without MDL.
   Conclusions: Reductions in LDL-C and other lipids with alirocumab, as well as safety and tolerability, were comparable between individuals with T2DM and with versus without MDL.

AB A phenocopy is an environmentally-defined phenotype that mimics another, genetically-determined phenotype. The severity of hypercholesterolaemia, extent of down regulation of LDL receptor expression and aortic root localisation of atherosclerosis in cholesterol-fed rabbits strikingly resemble the cardinal features of homozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia (FH) in humans, suggesting that the former is a phenocopy of the latter.
   This review compares the metabolic and pathological consequences of induced hypercholesterolaemia in rabbits with those of homozygous FH and contrasts their ease of reversibility on resumption of a normal diet with the refractoriness to lipid-lowering therapy of homozygotes, in whom major adverse cardiovascular events and survival depend upon the prevailing level of serum cholesterol. The monofactorial nature of the atherosclerosis in both situations corroborates Anitschkow's concept that "Cholesterin ist alles."
   In contrast, atherosclerosis in heterozygous FH differs in several respects from that of homozygotes, notably the lack of aortic root involvement and in its multifactorial aetiology, with raised LDL cholesterol, male gender, low HDL cholesterol and raised lipoprotein (a) all contributing to its clinical expression. In angiographic trials of LDL-lowering therapy regression of coronary lesions was observed in FH heterozygotes whereas they progressed in non-FH subjects. Similarly, carotid artery plaques progressed less in FH heterozygotes than in non-FH subjects, in both instances despite FH patients having higher LDL cholesterol levels on treatment.
   These findings suggest that, compared with non-FH subjects, atherosclerotic lesions in FH heterozygotes may be hyper-responsive to LDL-lowering therapy, whereas treatment of homozygous FH remains a major challenge. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Background and aims: PDZK1 (Post-synaptic density protein/Drosophila disc-large protein/Zonula occludens protein containing 1) stabilizes the HDL receptor protein, SR-B1, in the liver, and mediates SR-B1 signaling outside of the liver. Complete knockout of pdzk1 increases atherosclerosis in apoE-deficient mice, but the effect of PDZK1 in leukocytes is not known. In this study, we tested the role of leukocyte PDZK1 in atherosclerosis development by using bone marrow transplantation to generate ldlr deficient mice lacking PDZK1 in leukocytes.
   Methods: Ldlr(-/-) mice were transplanted with either pdzk1(-/-) or pdzk1(+/+) bone marrow and fed a high-fat diet to induce atherosclerosis.
   Results: Bone marrow specific pdzk1 knockout slightly increased atherosclerotic plaque sizes but strikingly increased sizes of necrotic cores and cellular apoptosis in within plaques. PDZK1 deficiency prevented HDL dependent protection of macrophages from apoptosis in vitro and sensitized peritoneal macrophages to apoptosis in situ. PDZK1 deficiency in macrophages also impaired their ability to engulf apoptotic cells, and attenuated the IL-4 dependent induction of mannose receptor in vitro and mannose receptor protein levels in macrophages in atherosclerotic plaques.
   Conclusions PDZK1 is required for anti-atherogenic responses in macrophages including HDL dependent protection against apoptosis and macrophage mediated efferocytosis and limits the accumulation of apoptotic cells within atherosclerotic plaques protecting against necrotic core development.

AB Background and aims: We aimed to determine the association of pericoronary adipose tissue (PCAT) volume and attenuation with culprit lesions in the underlying coronary segment in patients with acute myocardial infarction.
   Methods: In patients with myocardial infarction, PCAT volume and attenuation surrounding the following segments were manually traced from non-contrast CT imaging: LM, proximal and mid-segment of LAD, RCA, and LCX. PCAT volume and attenuation surrounding culprit and non-culprit lesions were compared. Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated per 1 standard deviation increase in PCAT volume/attenuation.
   Results: We included 46 subjects (mean age 64.4 +/- 16.4 years, 71% male) with acute myocardial infarction. PCAT volume around the right coronary artery was higher compared to left coronary segments, while PCAT attenuation decreased from proximal to distal segments. PCAT volume surrounding culprit lesions was higher compared to segments without culprit lesion (4.90 +/- 3.07 ml vs. 2.33 +/- 2.63ml, p < 0.0001), whereas the attenuation was not different (-84.8 +/- 9.4 HU vs. -84.2 +/- 9.9 HU, p = 0.77). In univariate regression analysis, PCAT volume was significantly associated with the probability of presence of culprit lesions (OR [95% CI]: 3.10 [1.84-5.22], p < 0.0001). Associations remained stable upon adjustment for risk factors (3.34 [1.81-6.15], p < 0.0001). PCAT attenuation was not relevantly different around culprit lesions (unadjusted: 0.94 [0.63-1.40], p = 0.77, risk factor adjusted: 1.00 [0.61-1.64], p = 0.996).
   Conclusions: In patients with acute myocardial infarction, PCAT volume is strongly and independently associated with culprit lesions in the underlying coronary segments, whereas PCAT attenuation does not relevantly differentiate surrounding coronary segments with and without culprit lesions.

AB Background and aims: It is not known if ultrasound carotid plaque features are associated with cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors or if they predict future CVD events.
   Methods: We measured total carotid plaque area (TPA) and grayscale plaque features (grayscale median, black areas, and discrete white areas) by B-mode carotid ultrasound among 2205 participants who participated in the first (baseline) visit of the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis. Multivariable linear regression was used to examine relationships between ultrasound plaque features and CVD risk factors at baseline. Cox proportional hazards models were used to assess if TPA, grayscale features, and carotid plaque score (number of arterial segments with a plaque) could predict incident coronary heart disease and cerebrovascular disease events over a mean follow-up of 13.3 years.
   Results: Participants were mean (standard deviation [SD]) 65.4 (9.6) years, 49% male, 39% White, 11% Chinese, 28% Black, and 22% Hispanic. Mean TPA 27.7 (24.7) mm(2), but no grayscale plaque features, was associated with CVD risk factors. In fully adjusted models, TPA but no grayscale features predicted incident coronary heart disease (CHD) events (HR 1.23; 95% CI 1.11-1.36; p<0.001), however, C-statistics for CHD were similar to carotid plaque score but less than for coronary artery calcium (CAC) scoring. Neither TPA nor grayscale features independently predicted cerebrovascular events.
   Conclusions: In middle-aged adults free of known cardiovascular disease, TPA but not grayscale plaque features was associated with CVD risk factors and predicted incident CHD events. For CHD, prediction indices for TPA were similar to carotid plaque score but less than for CAC. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Background and aims: The aim of this study was to assess agreement between optical coherence tomography (OCT) and histopathology for healed coronary plaques (HCPs) in human coronary arteries ex vivo, and to evaluate the prevalence and characteristics of HCPs in vivo.
   Methods: Ex vivo OCT images were co-registered with histopathology in 144 cross-sections with >= 50% stenosis. Of these, 30 randomly selected pairs were employed to define morphological features of OCT for HCPs (OCT-derived HCPs); the remaining 114 pairs were used to evaluate the accuracy of OCT in detecting histologically-defined HCPs. In a clinical study, 60 target lesions from 60 patients with stable ischemic heart disease were divided into 2 groups according to the presence or absence of OCT-derived HCPs. Plaque characteristics were compared between the two groups.
   Results: In the autopsy study, an OCT-derived HCP was defined as a plaque with heterogeneous signal-rich layers of different optical signal density. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of OCT-derived HCP to detect histologically-defined HCPs were 81%, 98%, 93%, and 93%, respectively. In the clinical study, 46 (77%) had OCT-derived HCPs. Both microvessels and macrophages were more frequently identified in OCT-derived HCPs compared to their counterparts (43% vs. 0%; p<0.01, 70% vs. 21%; p<0.01, respectively).
   Conclusions: An ex vivo OCT image has a good agreement with histology for HCPs detection. HCPs were frequently identified by OCT in target lesions in stable ischemic heart disease patients. OCT may be a useful intracoronary imaging for HCPs detection in vivo. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Background and aims: Mechanisms for the association between iron stores and risk factors for diabetes and cardiovascular disease, such as metabolic syndrome (MetS) and its components, are still not clear. We evaluated the associations between ferritin levels, MetS and its individual components, and potential role of confounding, in a meta-analysis.
   Methods: We searched articles in MEDLINE and EMBASE until February 14th, 2018. There were two approaches: meta-analysis of 1) cross-sectional and longitudinal studies and 2) only cross-sectional studies. Meta-regressions were conducted to identify sources of heterogeneity in the associations of ferritin with MetS and its individual components.
   Results: Information from 26 studies (5 prospective) was systematically reviewed and 21 studies were meta-analysed. The pooled OR for MetS by increased ferritin was 1.78 (95% CI: 1.60-1.97) in the meta-analysis 1, and 1.70 (95% CI: 1.49-1.95) in the meta-analysis 2. The pooled association was weaker in studies adjusted for hepatic injury markers (meta-regression coefficient (95% CI): -0.34 (-0.60,-0.09) p = 0.008) and body mass index (BMI) (meta-regression coefficient (95% CI): -0.27 (-0.53,-0.01) p = 0.039). Among MetS components, the pooled association with increased ferritin was strongest with high triglycerides [OR (95% CI): 1.96 (1.65-2.32)] and high glucose levels [OR 95% CI: 1.60 (1.40-1.82)]. Higher cut-off points used to define high ferritin concentrations were more strongly associated with high triglycerides [meta-regression coefficient (95% CI): 0.22 (0.03, 0.041), p = 0.023].
   Conclusions: High triglycerides and glucose are the components more strongly associated with ferritin. Hepatic injury and BMI appear to influence the ferritin-MetS association, and a threshold effect of high ferritin concentration on the ferritin-high triglycerides association was observed.

AB Background and aims: We recently showed that plasma cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) is mainly derived from VSIG4-positive Kupffer cells. Activation of these cells by the bacterial endotoxin lipopolysaccharide (LPS) strongly decreases CETP expression. As Kupffer cell activation plays a detrimental role in the progression of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), we aimed to study if metabolic liver inflammation is also associated with a decrease in hepatic and circulating CETP.
   Methods: We collected plasma and liver biopsy samples at various stages of NAFLD from 93 obese individuals who underwent bariatric surgery. Liver lobular inflammation was histologically determined, and liver CETP expression, CETP positive cells, circulating CETP concentrations, and liver VSIG4 expression were quantified.
   Results: Mean (SD) plasma CETP concentration was 2.68 (0.89) mu g/mL. In the presence of liver inflammation, compared to the absence of pathology, the difference in hepatic CETP expression was -0.03 arbitrary units (95% CI -0.26, 0.20), the difference in number of hepatic CETP positive cells (range 11-140 per mm(2)) was -20.0 per mm(2) (95% CI -41.6, 1.9), and the difference in plasma CETP was -0.35 mu g/mL (95% CI -0.80, 0.10). Hepatic VSIG4 expression was not associated with liver inflammation (0.00; 95% CI -0.15, 0.15).
   Conclusions: We found no strong evidence for a strong negative association between metabolic liver inflammation and CETP-related outcomes in obese individuals, although we observed consistent trends. These data indicate that metabolic liver inflammation does not mimic the strong effects of LPS on the hepatic expression and production of CETP by Kupffer cells. (C) 2018 The Authors.

AB Background and aims: We aimed to improve the understanding of potential associations between commonly available hematological biomarkers and the coronary artery calcification (CAC) score, which may help unravel the pathophysiology of coronary calcifications and subclinical coronary artery disease.
   Methods: A cross-sectional study was performed within the Utrecht Patient Oriented Database (UPOD). Patients with suspected or known coronary artery disease who underwent CT CAC scoring as well as standard hematology analysis that was part of routine clinical care (within 3 months of CT acquisition) were included. Complete hematology datasets were extracted from hematology analyzers. Linear regression adjusted for potential confounders was used to assess if hematological biomarkers were related to the CAC score.
   Results: In total, 1504 patients were included, of whom 43% (n = 647) had a CAC score of 0. Mean age (+/- SD) was 53 +/- 13 years, and 34% of patients were women. Red blood cell distribution width (RDW, beta=0.20 [0.05-0.36], p =0.007), the fraction of immature reticulocytes (beta=0.97 [0.10-6.43], p =0.004), coefficient of variation of neutrophil lobularity (beta = 0.13 [0.01-0.25], p=0.040) and mean lymphocyte cell size (beta=0.21 [0.08-0.34], p =0.001) were positively associated with the CAC score after adjustment for age, sex, body mass index (BMI), diabetes, glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and high-density lipoprotein (HDL).
   Conclusions: This study confirms the known association of RDW with the CAC score, and presents the fraction of immature reticulocytes, coefficient of variation of neutrophil lobularity, and mean lymphocyte cell size as new markers associated with a higher CAC score.

AB Background and aims: We examined the association between the American Heart Association's Life's Simple 7 (LS7) metrics and the risk of atrial fibrillation (AF) in the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA), a prospective cohort study of adults free of cardiovascular disease (CVD) at baseline.
   Methods: We analyzed data from 6506 participants. The LS7 metrics (smoking, physical activity, body mass index, diet, blood pressure, total cholesterol and blood glucose) were each categorized into ideal (assigned 2 points), intermediate (1 point) or poor (0 points). Scores were summed for a maximum of 14. A score of 0-8 was considered inadequate; 9-10, average and 11-14, optimal for cardiovascular health. Atrial fibrillation was ascertained using ICD-9 codes from hospital discharge records and Medicare claims data. Cox proportional hazard ratios (HR) and incidence rates of AF per 1000 person-years were calculated.
   Results: During a median follow-up of 11.2 years (interquartile range: 10.6-11.7 years), 709 (11%) participants were hospitalized with a first AF episode. In the overall cohort, optimal scores at baseline were associated with a 27% lower risk for AF compared with inadequate scores (0.73 [0.59-0.91]). A similar finding was observed when the results were stratified by race/ethnicity (White, Chinese American, African American and Hispanic), though many of the associations were not statistically significant. There was no interaction by race/ethnicity (p = 0.15).
   Conclusions: In the overall cohort, optimal LS7 status was associated with a lower risk of AF. These findings suggest that promoting ideal cardiovascular health may reduce the incidence and burden of AF. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Background and aims: Lipocalin-2 (Lcn2) is a glycoprotein which can be secreted by immune cells. Several studies in humans have suggested Lcn2 can be used as a biomarker for the detection of unstable atherosclerotic lesions, partly as it is known to interact with MMP-9.
   Methods: In this study, we generated Ldlr(-/-)Lcn2(-/-) mice to assess the functional role of Lcn2 in different stages of atherosclerosis. Atherosclerotic lesions were characterized through histological analysis and myeloid cell populations were examined using flow cytometry.
   Results: We show that Ldlr(-/-) Lcn2(-/-) mice developed larger atherosclerotic lesions during earlier stages of atherosclerosis and had increased circulating Ly6C(hi) inflammatory monocytes compared to Ldlr(-/-) mice. Advanced atherosclerotic lesions from Ldlr(-/-) Lcn2(-/-) mice had decreased necrotic core area, suggesting Lcn2 deficiency may affect lesion stability. Furthermore, MMP-9 activity was diminished in plaques from Ldlr(-/-)Lcn2(-/- )mice.
   Conclusions: Altogether, these findings suggest that Lcn2 deficiency promotes lesion growth in earlier stages of the disease while it decreases MMP-9 activity and necrotic core size in advanced atherosclerosis. (C) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

   PLASMA; PANCREATITIS; APOA5; POPULATION; EXPRESSION; ETIOLOGY
AB Familial chylomicronaemia syndrome (FCS) is a rare, inherited disorder characterised by impaired clearance of triglyceride (TG)-rich lipoproteins from plasma, leading to severe hypertriglyceridaemia (HTG) and a markedly increased risk of acute pancreatitis. It is due to the lack of lipoprotein lipase (LPL) function, resulting from recessive loss of function mutations in the genes coding LPL or its modulators. A large overlap in the phenotype between FCS and multifactorial chylomicronaemia syndrome (MCS) contributes to the inconsistency in how patients are diagnosed and managed worldwide, whereas the incidence of acute hypertriglyceridaemic pancreatitis is more frequent in FCS. A panel of European experts provided guidance on the diagnostic strategy surrounding FCS and proposed an algorithm-based diagnosis tool for identification of these patients, which can be readily translated into practice. Features included in this FCS score comprise: severe elevation of plasma TGs (fasting TG levels > 10 mmol/L [885 mg/dL] on multiple occasions), refractory to standard TG-lowering therapies, a young age at onset, the lack of secondary factors (except for pregnancy and oral oestrogens) and a history of episodes of acute pancreatitis. Considering 53 FCS patients from three cohorts and 52 MCS patients from three cohorts, the overall sensitivity of the FCS score (>= 10) was 88% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.76, 0.97) with an overall specificity of 85% (95% CI: 0.75, 0.94). Receiver operating characteristic curve area was 0.91. Pragmatic clinical scoring, by standardising diagnosis, may help differentiate FCS from MCS, may alleviate the need for systematic genotyping in patients with severe HTG and may help identify high-priority candidates for genotyping.

AB During their metabolism, all lipoproteins undergo endocytosis, either to be degraded intracellularly, for example in hepatocytes or macrophages, or to be re-secreted, for example in the course of transcytosis by endothelial cells. Moreover, there are several examples of internalized lipoproteins sequestered intracellularly, possibly to exert intracellular functions, for example the cytolysis of trypanosoma. Endocytosis and the subsequent intracellular itinerary of lipoproteins hence are key areas for understanding the regulation of plasma lipid levels as well as the biological functions of lipoproteins. Indeed, the identification of the low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-receptor and the unraveling of its transcriptional regulation led to the elucidation of familial hypercholesterolemia as well as to the development of statins, the most successful therapeutics for lowering of cholesterol levels and risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases. Novel limiting factors of intracellular trafficking of LDL and the LDL receptor continue to be discovered and to provide drug targets such as PCSK9. Surprisingly, the receptors mediating endocytosis of high-density lipoproteins or lipoprotein(a) are still a matter of controversy or even new discovery. Finally, the receptors and mechanisms, which mediate the uptake of lipoproteins into non-degrading intracellular itineraries for re-secretion (transcytosis, retroendocytosis), storage, or execution of intracellular functions, are largely unknown.

AB Background and aims: While a plethora of biomarkers have been shown to be associated with coronary artery disease, studies assessing biomarkers in coronary microvascular dysfunction (CMD) are few. We investigated associations between cardiovascular protein biomarkers and non-endothelium dependent CMD assessed by positron emission tomography (PET).
   Methods: In 97 women with angina pectoris and no significant obstructive coronary artery disease (<50% stenosis on invasive coronary angiography), CMD was defined as myocardial blood flow reserve (MBFR) <2.5 by rubidium-82 PET. Blood samples were analyzed with a cardiovascular disease proteomic panel encompassing 92 biomarkers. The relation between MBFR and biomarkers was evaluated with age-adjusted regression analysis.
   Results: Median age was 62 years (range 31-79), median MBFR was 2.7 (range 1.2-4.7) and 32% had non-endothelium dependent CMD (MBFR<2.5). Four biomarkers were significantly correlated with MBFR: Galectin-4 (Gal4, p = 0.008), growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF15, p = 0.026), tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA, p = 0.030) and von Willebrand factor (vWF, p = 0.018), while 12 biomarkers showed a trend for correlation (0.05 <= p < 0.15). Of the 16 identified biomarkers, 10 are involved in pro-inflammatory pathways.
   Conclusions: In a panel of 92 cardiovascular protein biomarkers, 4 were significantly associated with non-endothelium dependent CMD in women: Gal4, GDF15, tPA and vWF, suggesting that inflammatory status and coagulation changes are associated with impaired microvascular dilatation. Further confirmatory studies are needed to corroborate these findings. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Background and aims: Impaired glucose metabolism during pregnancy may associate with changes in fetal cholesterol metabolism. We investigated if gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) affects newborn cholesterol metabolism as determined by cord blood squalene and non-cholesterol sterols. Furthermore, we examined potential correlations between cord blood and maternal serum non-cholesterol sterols.
   Methods: Pregnant women at risk for GDM (BMI>30 kg/m(2)) were enrolled from maternity clinics in Finland. GDM was determined from the results of an oral glucose tolerance test. Serum samples were taken in the third trimester of pregnancy, and cord blood samples collected from their newborns at birth. Squalene and non-cholesterol sterols were analyzed from serum and cord blood by gas liquid chromatography. All women with GDM were in good glycaemic control.
   Results: The ratios of squalene and non-cholesterol sterols to cholesterol (100 x mu mol/mmol of cholesterol) in cord blood did not differ between the infants born to mothers with GDM (n = 15) or mothers with normal glucose tolerance (n = 13). The ratios of sitosterol and campesterol to cholesterol in the cord blood correlated with the corresponding maternal serum ratios (r = 0.70, p < 0.0001) in both groups.
   Conclusions: In obese women under good glycaemic control, GDM did not affect newborn cholesterol metabolism. Cord blood sitosterol and campesterol ratios to cholesterol correlated with the corresponding maternal serum ratios thus potentially reflecting maternal-fetal cholesterol transport.

AB Background and aims: Subendothelial interaction of LDL with extracellular matrix drives atherogenesis. This interaction can be strengthened by proteolytic modification of LDL. Mast cells (MCs) are present in atherosclerotic lesions, and upon activation, they degranulate and release a variety of neutral proteases. Here we studied the ability of MC proteases to cleave apoB-100 of LDL and affect the binding of LDL to proteoglycans.
   Methods: Mature human MCs were differentiated from human peripheral blood-derived CD34(+) progenitors in vitro and activated with calcium ionophore to generate MC-conditioned medium. LDL was incubated in the MC-conditioned medium or with individual MC proteases, and the binding of native and modified LDL to isolated human aortic proteoglycans or to human atherosclerotic plaques ex vivo was determined. MC proteases in atherosclerotic human coronary artery lesions were detected by immunofluorescence and qPCR.
   Results: Activated human MCs released the neutral proteases tryptase, chymase, carboxypeptidase A3, cathepsin G, and granzyme B. Of these, cathepsin G degraded most efficiently apoB-100, induced LDL fusion, and enhanced binding of LDL to isolated human aortic proteoglycans and human atherosclerotic lesions ex vivo. Double immunofluoresence staining of human atherosclerotic coronary arteries for tryptase and cathepsin G indicated that lesional MCs contain cathepsin G. In the lesions, expression of cathepsin G correlated with the expression of tryptase and chymase, but not with that of neutrophil proteinase 3.
   Conclusions: The present study suggests that cathepsin G in human atherosclerotic lesions is largely derived from MCs and that activated MCs may contribute to atherogenesis by enhancing LDL retention. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Background and aims: Macrophages are key factors in the formation of unstable atherosclerotic plaques, which may be identified through macrophage imaging. We tested whether activatable fluorescence probes of iron oxide nanoparticles (IONPs) conjugated with indocyanine green (ICG) (IONP-ICG), consisting of biocompatible reagents, can visualize macrophages present in atherosclerotic plaques.
   Methods: IONP-based probes conjugated with different numbers of ICG molecules were synthesized. Sixweek-old spontaneously hyperlipidemic (SHL) mice were fed either a Western or normal diet for 14 weeks, and were intravenously injected with IONP-ICG (55.8 mg Fe/kg). Aortas were harvested 48 h later, and aortas containing atherosclerotic plaques were imaged.
   Results: Phantom imaging studies using IONP-ICG solution demonstrated that the addition of surfactants to IONP-ICG solutions yielded fluorescence activation. Incubation of macrophages with IONP-ICG led to internalization of IONP-ICG and near infrared fluorescence (NIRF) activation. In NIRF imaging studies, intense fluorescence signals were clearly visible primarily at the margins of atherosclerotic plaques, and relatively weak signals were evident inside the plaques, demonstrating the feasibility of detection of NIRF signals at atherosclerotic plaques. In the quantitative evaluation of NIRF, administration of a probe conjugated with more ICG molecules led to a significant increase in the NIRF signal, indicating that probes with greater numbers of ICG molecules are effective for sensitive NIRF detection. SHL mice given a low-cholesterol normal diet showed a significantly lower NIRF signal compared with mice given the Western diet. Histologically, NIRF signals in atherosclerotic plaques strongly correlated with the location of macrophages, suggesting the possibility of NIRF macrophage imaging using IONP-ICG.
   Conclusions: Localization of macrophages in atherosclerotic plaques may be achieved using the activatable NIRF probe, IONP-ICG. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

   Roles of urokinase plasminogen activator receptor and integrins

AB Background and aims: Lipoprotein(a) (Lp(a)) is a causal risk factor for cardiovascular disorders including coronary heart disease and calcific aortic valve stenosis. Apolipoprotein(a) (apo(a)), the unique glycoprotein component of Lp(a), contains sequences homologous to plasminogen. Plasminogen activation is markedly accelerated in the presence of cell surface receptors and can be inhibited in this context by apo(a).
   Methods: We evaluated the role of potential receptors in regulating plasminogen activation and the ability of apo(a) to mediate inhibition of plasminogen activation on vascular and monocytic/macrophage cells through knockdown (siRNA or blocking antibodies) or overexpression of various candidate receptors. Binding assays were conducted to determine apo(a) and plasminogen receptor interactions.
   Results: The urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor (uPAR) modulates plasminogen activation as well as plasminogen and apo(a) binding on human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), human acute monocytic leukemia (THP-1) cells, and THP-1 macrophages as determined through uPAR knockdown and overexpression. Apo(a) variants lacking either the kringle V or the strong lysine binding site in kringle IV type 10 are not able to bind to uPAR to the same extent as wild-type apo(a). Plasminogen activation is also modulated, albeit to a lower extent, through the Mac-1 (alpha(M)beta(2)) integrin on HUVECs and THP-1 monocytes. Integrin alpha(V)beta(3) can regulate plasminogen activation on THP-1 monocytes and to a lesser extent on HUVECs.
   Conclusions: These results indicate cell type-specific roles for uPAR, alpha(M)beta(2), and alpha(V)beta(3) in promoting plasminogen activation and mediate the inhibitory effects of apo(a) in this process. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Background and aims: The association between minimally elevated coronary artery calcification (CAC) and cerebrovascular disease is not well known. We assessed whether individuals with minimal CAC (Agatston scores of 1-10) have higher ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) frequencies compared with those with no CAC. We also investigated the relative prevalence of carotid atherosclerosis in these two groups.
   Methods: A total of 3924 participants from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) without previous cardiovascular events, including stroke, and with baseline CAC scores of 0-10 were followed for the occurrence of incident ischemic stroke/TIA. We used carotid ultrasound to detect carotid artery plaques and to measure the intima-media thickness (IMT).
   Results: During a median follow-up of 13.2 years, 130 participants developed incident ischemic stroke/TIA. There was no significant difference in the ischemic stroke/TIA incidence between those with minimal CAC and no CAC (3.7 versus 2.7 per 1000 person-years). In participants with minimal CAC, we observed a significant association of the condition with an internal carotid artery (ICA) that had a greater-than-average IMT (ICA-IMT; beta = 0.071, p = 0.001) and a higher odds ratio (OR) for carotid artery plaques (OR 1.46; with a 95% confidence interval [CI] of 1.18-1.80; p < 0.001).
   Conclusions: A CAC score of 0-10 is associated with a low rate of ischemic stroke/TIA, and thus a minimal CAC score is not a valuable predictive marker for ischemic stroke/TIA. A minimal CAC score may, however, provide an early and asymptomatic sign of carotid artery disease. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Background and aims: Prognosis variations in patients discharged after an acute coronary syndrome (ACS) according to the professionals involved has not been clearly outlined. The aim of our study was to assess the impact on a specific outpatient clinic (SOC).
   Methods: We included all consecutive patients admitted for an ACS in a single center. We performed a propensity score matching with all patients discharged from hospital according to whether they were referred to the SOC or not.
   Results: From the 1822 patients discharged, 260 couples of well-balanced ACS patients were obtained after propensity score matching. Median follow-up was 43.3 months and cardiovascular mortality rate was 10.4%, all-cause mortality was 13.9% and any MACE 38.2%. Patients attended the SOC had significantly lower rates at all three endpoints. Multivariate analysis results showed how the follow-up in the SOC was associated with significantly lower risk at all endpoints. SOC patients also had significantly lower rate at hospital readmissions and the multivariate analysis identified a negative association between the first cardiovascular readmission and SOC (sHR: 0.26 95%CI 0.18-0.367; p < 0.01). Mean LDLc levels at the time of ACS admission was 99.0 (36.7) mg/dl and no difference was observed in patients referred to SOC vs. non-referred. Patients followed at the SOC achieved significantly lower LDLc and higher percentage of LDLc <70 mg/dl (56.7% vs. 36.7%; p < 0.01). SOC follow-up was associated with 44% higher probability of final LDLc <70 mg/dl.
   Conclusions: An SOC for ACS patients was independently associated with higher LDLc control and longterm survival. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Therapeutic silencing of FSP27 reduces the progression of

AB Background and aims: Obesity, hepatosteatosis, and hypertriglyceridemia are components of the metabolic syndrome and independent risk factors for cardiovascular disease. The lipid droplet-associated protein CIDEC (cell death-inducing DFFA-like effector C), known in mice as FSP27 (fat-specific protein 27), plays a key role in maintaining triacylglyceride (TAG) homeostasis in adipose tissue and liver, and controls circulating TAG levels in mice. Importantly, mutations and SNPs in CIDEC are associated with dyslipidemia and altered metabolic function in humans. Here we tested whether systemic silencing of Fsp27 using antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) was atheroprotective in LDL receptor knock-out (Ldlr(-/-)) mice.
   Methods: Atheroprone Ldlr(-/-) mice were fed a high-fat, high-cholesterol diet for 12 weeks while simultaneously dosed with saline, ASO-ctrl, or ASO-Fsp27.
   Results: Data show that, compared to control treatments, silencing Fsp27 significantly reduced body weight gain and visceral adiposity, prevented diet-induced hypertriglyceridemia, and reduced atherosclerotic lesion size both in en face aortas and in the aortic root.
   Conclusions: Our findings suggest that therapeutic silencing of Fsp27 with ASOs may be beneficial in the prevention and management of atherogenic disease in patients with metabolic syndrome. (C) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Background and aims: Obesity is frequently associated with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), insulin resistance (IR), inflammation and metabolic syndrome (MetS), all of which increase the risk of type 2 diabetes (T2DM). However, the role of these risk factors in mediating the effect of obesity remains unclear. We investigated the association between obesity and T2DM in the absence and presence of NAFLD, IR, inflammation and MetS components.
   Methods: 29,836 obese subjects without diabetes were studied in a Korean health screening program. Obesity was defined by the appropriate ethnic-specific body mass index (BMI) threshold >= 25 kg/m(2). Hazard ratios (HRs and 95% confidence intervals, CIs) for incident T2DM were estimated for the group with no hypertension, dyslipidemia, impaired fasting glucose, fatty liver, IR, or inflammation (n= 1717), compared to the reference group, with one or more of these factors (n= 19,757).
   Results: Mean (SD) age at baseline was 37 (7) years and 1200 incident cases of diabetes occurred. Crude T2D incidence was 12.6/10,000 person-years in the group without metabolic abnormality and 143/ 10,000 person-years in the reference group. HR (95% CIs) for incident diabetes was 0.13 (0.06, 0.33) in the group without metabolic abnormality.
   Conclusions: Obese subjects without components of the metabolic syndrome, IR, fatty liver and inflammation have an approximately 11-fold lower risk of incident type 2 diabetes than obese subjects who have these risk factors. These simple factors could be used to target limited resources in high risk obese subjects in the prevention of diabetes. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier B.V.

   to mesenchymal transition and aggravates plaque vulnerability

   ACTIVATION; CELLS
AB Background and aims: Carotid atherosclerotic plaque is one of the main sources of ischemic stroke, and endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EndMT) is a major feature of atherosclerosis. Rho-associated coiled-coil-containing protein kinase 1 (ROCK1) activation, stimulated by high glucose, plays an important role in EndMT, and circadian locomotor output cycles protein kaput (Clock) deficiency leads to hyperglycemia and enhanced atherosclerosis in Clock(Delta 19/Delta 19) apolipoprotein E (ApoE)(-/-) mice. These findings point to a mechanism whereby CLOCK exerts a protective effect against EndMT and atherosclerotic plaque accumulation.
   Methods: Cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were stimulated with 66 mM glucose for 120 h to induce EndMT. The expression of CLOCK and ROCK1 was assayed, as were their effects on EndMT. We also conducted molecular and morphometric examination of carotid artery plaques from patients with carotid artery stenosis to assess the clinical relevance of these findings.
   Results: Upon EndMT, HUVECs exhibited decreased CLOCK expression and increased ROCK1 expression. Notably, CLOCK silencing increased high glucose-induced EndMT, migration ability, and ROCK1 activation, while overexpressing CLOCK attenuated these characteristics. Moreover, inhibition of ROCK1 largely blocked EndMT induced by high-glucose or transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta 1 but failed to rescue the reduced CLOCK expression. The vulnerability of human carotid artery plaque was strongly correlated with loss of CLOCK expression, activation of TGF-beta/ROCK1 signaling, and the extent of EndMT.
   Conclusions: The data indicate that loss of protective endothelial CLOCK expression aggravates TGF-beta/ ROCK1-modulated EndMT progression, which contributes to the vulnerability of human carotid plaque. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Background and aims: Wall shear stress (WSS) has an important role in the natural history of coronary atherosclerosis. The aim of this study is to investigate the relationship between WSS and the lipid content of atherosclerotic plaques as assessed by near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS).
   Methods: We performed serial NIRS and intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) upon Doppler coronary flow guidewire of coronary plaques at baseline and after 12-18 months in 28 patients with <30% angiographic stenosis, who presented with coronary artery disease. Segmental WSS, plaque burden and NIRS-derived lipid rich plaque (LRP) were evaluated at both time-points in 482 consecutive 2-mm coronary segments.
   Results: Segments with LRP at baseline (n = 106) had a higher average WSS (1.4 +/- 0.6 N/m(2)), compared to those without LRP (n = 376) (1.2 +/- 0.6 N/m(2), p<0.001). In segments without baseline LRP, WSS was higher in those who subsequently developed new LRP (n = 35) than those who did not (n = 341) (1.4 +/- 0.8 vs. 1.1 +/- 0.6 N/m(2), p=0.002). Conversely, in segments with baseline LRP, WSS was lower in those who had regression of lipid content (n = 41) than those who did not (n = 65) (1.2 +/- 0.4 vs. 1.6 +/- 0.7 N/m(2), p=0.007). Segments with the highest tertile of WSS displayed greater progression of LCBI irrespective of baseline lipid content (p<0.001). Multivariate analysis revealed that baseline WSS (p=0.017), PAV (p<0.001) and LCBI (p<0.001) were all independent predictors of change in LCBI over time.
   Conclusions: Coronary segments with high WSS associate with progression of lipid content over time, which may indicate transformation to a more vulnerable phenotype. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Background and aims: Epicardial adipose tissue (EAT) volume derived from contrast enhanced (CE) computed tomography (CT) scans is not well validated. We aim to establish a reliable threshold to accurately quantify EAT volume from CE datasets.
   Methods: We analyzed EAT volume on paired non-contrast (NC) and CE datasets from 25 patients to derive appropriate Hounsfield (HU) cutpoints to equalize two EAT volume estimates. The gold standard threshold (-190HU, -30HU) was used to assess EAT volume on NC datasets. For CE datasets, EAT volumes were estimated using three previously reported thresholds: (-190HU, -30HU), (-190HU, -15HU), (-175HU, -15HU) and were analyzed by a semi-automated 3D Fat analysis software. Subsequently, we applied a threshold correction to (-190HU, -30HU) based on mean differences in radiodensity between NC and CE images (Delta EATrd = CE radiodensity - NC radiodensity). We then validated our findings on EAT threshold in 21 additional patients with paired CT datasets.
   Results: EAT volume from CE datasets using previously published thresholds consistently underestimated EAT volume from NC dataset standard by a magnitude of 8.2%-19.1%. Using our corrected threshold (-190HU, -3HU) in CE datasets yielded statistically identical EAT volume to NC EAT volume in the validation cohort (186.1 +/- 80.3 vs. 185.5 +/- 80.1 cm(3), Delta = 0.6 cm(3), 0.3%, p = 0.374).
   Conclusions: Estimating EAT volume from contrast enhanced CT scans using a corrected threshold of -190HU, -3HU provided excellent agreement with EAT volume from non-contrast CT scans using a standard threshold of -190HU, -30HU. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Background and aims: The cost effectiveness of cascade testing for familial hypercholesterolaemia (FH) is well recognised. Less clear is the cost effectiveness of FH screening when it includes case identification strategies that incorporate routinely available data from primary and secondary care electronic health records.
   Methods: Nine strategies were compared, all using cascade testing in combination with different index case approaches (primary care identification, secondary care identification, and clinical assessment using the Simon Broome (SB) or Dutch Lipid Clinic Network (DLCN) criteria). A decision analytic model was informed by three systematic literature reviews and expert advice provided by a NICE Guideline Committee.
   Results: The model found that the addition of primary care case identification by database search for patients with recorded total cholesterol >9.3 mmol/L was more cost effective than cascade testing alone. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of clinical assessment using the DLCN criteria was (sic)3254 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) compared with case-finding with no genetic testing. The ICER of clinical assessment using the SB criteria was (sic)13,365 per QALY (compared with primary care identification using the DLCN criteria), indicating that the SB criteria was preferred because it achieved additional health benefits at an acceptable cost. Secondary care identification, with either the SB or DLCN criteria, was not cost effective, alone (dominated and dominated respectively) or combined with primary care identification ((sic)63, 514 per QALY, and (sic)82,388 per QALY respectively).
   Conclusions: Searching primary care databases for people at high risk of FH followed by cascade testing is likely to be cost-effective. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Background and aims: Diabetic patients with no history of cardiac infarction have a prevalence of coronary atherosclerosis and a risk of heart attack equivalent to euglycemic patients who have coronary atherosclerosis and have suffered a prior myocardial infarction. Although several murine models of diabetes have been established, none of these show indications of cardiac events. In an attempt to establish a diabetic mouse model with coronary atherosclerosis and myocardial injury, we have fed hyperglycemic ApoE(-/-):Ins2+/Akita mice a western diet to enhance the dyslipidemic phenotype.
   Methods: Five-week-old ApoE(-/-):Ins2+/Akita mice and ApoE(-/-)- controls were fed a diet, 0.15% cholesterol and 21% anhydrous milk lipids, until 25 weeks of age. Changes in lifespan, clinical and metabolic parameters were evaluated as well as atherosclerosis and heart injury.
   Results: In comparison to male ApoE(-/-), male ApoE(-/-):Ins2+/Akita mice presented with chronic hyperglycemia (30.8 +/- 1.2 mM vs. 9.3 +/- 0.5 mM) accompanied by extremely high levels of total plasma cholesterol (49.3 +/- 6.3 mM vs. 30.1 +/- 1.5 mM) and triglycerides (11.6 +/- 1.7 mM vs. 2.36 +/- 0.18 mM). These mice have atherosclerosis at multiple vascular sites, including aortic sinus, ascending and descending aorta, brachiocephalic artery and coronary arteries. In addition, myocardial infarcts and a significant reduction of the lifespan (close to 20% of survival vs. other groups) were observed. Distinctively, both strains of female mice presented a parallel increase in plasma lipids, atherosclerosis, and no effects on mortality.
   Conclusions: We have established a diabetic mouse model, the western-diet-fed male ApoE(-/-):Ins2(+/Akita ) mouse, with profound cardiovascular disease involving extensive atherosclerosis, coronary artery disease and myocardial infarct resulting in shortened lifespan.

AB Background and aims: To evaluate changes in the high-density lipoprotein (HDL) proteome and HDL function in active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients initiating therapy with abatacept or adalimumab in the Abatacept Versus Adalimumab Comparison in Biologic-Naive RA Subjects with Background Methotrexate (AMPLE) study.
   Methods: Ultra high-pressure liquid chromatography (UHPLC) coupled with ion mobility mass spectrometry (LC-IM-MS) was used to analyze proteins associated with immunoaffinity-captured HDL from plasma of 30 patients with RA randomized to either abatacept (n = 15) or adalimumab (n = 15) therapy. Paraoxonase 1 (PON1) activity, HDL anti-oxidant capacity, cholesterol profiles, and homocysteine levels were also measured at baseline and following treatment. Repeated-measures analyses were performed using mixed-effect linear models to model the within-subject covariance over time.
   Results: In models controlling for age, sex and treatment group, improvement in inflammation measured by decreases in CRP was associated with improvement in HDL function and changes in several HDL-associated proteins including significant decreases in lipopolysaccharide-binding protein, serum amyloid A-I (SAA-I) and inter-alpha-trypsin inhibitor heavy chain H4 (p values <0.05). Improvement in disease activity was also associated with changes in multiple HDL-associated proteins. Adalimumab was associated with higher PON1 activity, HDL-associated serotransferrin, and HDL-associated immunoglobulin J chain, and lower HDL-associated SAA-I over time compared with abatacept.
   Conclusions: Improvement in inflammation associated with treatment of RA, using either abatacept or adalimumab in the AMPLE study, was associated with improvement in HDL function and significant alterations in the HDL proteome, including proteins involved in the immune response, proteinase inhibition, and lipid metabolism.

AB Background and aims: The modified creatinine (Cr) index, calculated by age, sex, pre-dialysis serum Cr levels, and Kt/V for urea, reflects skeletal muscle mass in patients on hemodialysis. Whether the modified Cr index is associated with cardiovascular events and all-cause mortality remains unknown.
   Methods: A total of 3027 patients registered in the Q-Cohort Study, a multicenter, prospective study of patients on hemodialysis in Japan, were analyzed. The main outcomes were cardiovascular events and all-cause mortality. Associations between sex-specific quartiles of the modified Cr index and outcomes were analyzed by the Cox proportional hazard models and the Fine-Gray proportional subdistribution hazards model.
   Results: The modified Cr index was correlated with known nutritional and inflammatory markers. During a 4-year follow-up, 499 patients died of any cause, 372 experienced heart disease, and 194 developed stroke. The risk for all-cause mortality was significantly higher in the lower quartiles (Q1 and Q2) than in the highest quartile (Q4) as the reference group (hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals: Q1, 2.65 [1.69-4.25], Q2, 1.92 [1.27-2.94], and Q3, 1.31 [0.87-2.02]). The risk of heart disease was significantly higher in Q1 than in Q4 (hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals: Ql, 1.64 [1.04-2.61], Q2, 1.34 [0.91-2.00], and Q3, 1.04 [0.71-1.52]). The risk of stroke was not associated with the modified Cr index.
   Conclusions: A lower modified Cr index is associated with an increased risk for heart disease and all-cause mortality, but not with the risk for stroke in patients on hemodialysis. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Background and aims: Ticagrelor reduces cardiovascular events in patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Recent studies demonstrated the expression of P2Y12 on vascular cells including endothelial cells, as well as platelets, and suggested its contribution to atherogenesis. We investigated whether ticagrelor attenuates vascular dysfunction and inhibits atherogenesis in apolipoprotein Edeficient (apoe(-/-)) mice.
   Methods: Eight-week-old male apoe(-/-) mice were fed a western-type diet (WTD) supplemented with 0.1% ticagrelor (approximately 120 mg/kg/day). Non-treated animals on WTD served as control. Atherosclerotic lesions were examined by en face Sudan IV staining, histological analyses, quantitative RT-PCR analysis, and western blotting. Endothelial function was analyzed by acetylcholine-dependent vasodilation using aortic rings. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) were used for in vitro experiments.
   Results: Ticagrelor treatment for 20 weeks attenuated atherosclerotic lesion progression in the aortic arch compared with control (p <0.05). Ticagrelor administration for 8 weeks attenuated endothelial dysfunction (p < 0.01). Ticagrelor reduced the expression of inflammatory molecules such as vascular cell adhesion molecule-1, macrophage accumulation, and lipid deposition. Ticagrelor decreased the phosphorylation of JNK in the aorta compared with control (p <0.05). Ticagrelor and a JNK inhibitor ameliorated impairment of endothelium-dependent vasodilation by adenosine diphosphate (ADP) in wild-type mouse aortic segments. Furthermore, ticagrelor inhibited the expression of inflammatory molecules which were promoted by ADP in HUVEC (p < 0.001). Ticagrelor also inhibited ADP-induced JNK activation in HUVEC (p < 0.05).
   Conclusions: Ticagrelor attenuated vascular dysfunction and atherogenesis through the inhibition of inflammatory activation of endothelial cells. These effects might be a potential mechanism by which ticagrelor decreases cardiovascular events in patients with ACS. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Background and aims: The PREDIMED (PREvencion con Dleta MEDiterranea) is a multicentre trial analyzed as a prospective cohort study. A total of 7122 participants (aged 55-80 years) at high risk of cardiovascular disease in the PREDIMED trial were recruited in 11 centres in Spain. The prevalence of subjects with type 2 diabetes was 50%. Our objective was to determine the contribution of lifestyle factors to the development of peripheral artery disease (PAD).
   Methods: Incident clinical PAD in relation to a healthy lifestyle 5-point score defined as adherence to a Mediterranean diet (MedDiet), moderate alcohol intake, regular physical activity, normal weight (BMI<25) and non-smoking was measured.
   Results: Eighty-seven incident PAD cases were diagnosed during a median follow-up of 4.8 years. Compared with participants with 0 or 1 healthy lifestyle factor, the multivariable hazard ratio for PAD was 0.65 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.37 to 1.14) for 2 factors, and 0.40 (0.22-0.72) for 3 or more. Moderate alcohol consumption, non-smoking, physical activity and following a MedDiet were significantly inversely associated with PAD whereas no association was found for normal weight (BMI<25 kg/m(2)). PAD risk monotonically decreased with an increasing number of lifestyle factors, and the greatest reduction was found for a score combining moderate alcohol consumption, MedDiet and physical activity or non-smoking. The multivariable-adjusted population attributable risk percent for the combination of these 4 factors was 80.5% (95% CI: 21.3%-95.1%).
   Conclusions: Our results demonstrate that a simple healthy lifestyle score is associated with a substantially reduced risk of PAD in a high cardiovascular risk population with a high prevalence (50%) of subjects with type 2 diabetes. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Background and aims: The ankle-brachial index (ABI) is a predictor of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and premature death. However, few studies on this marker are available in the general Asian populations. This study aimed to investigate the association between ABI measured with oscillometry and the risk of these outcomes.
   Methods: We conducted an individual participant data meta-analysis in 10,679 community-dwelling Japanese individuals without a history of CVD. The primary outcome was a composite of CVD events and all-cause mortality.
   Results: During an average of 7.8 years of follow-up, 720 participants experienced the primary outcome. The multivariable-adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) of the primary outcome significantly increased with a lower ABI. The HRs were 1.07 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.91-1.27) for ABI of 1.00-1.09, HR 1.37 (95% CI 1.04-1.81) for ABI of 0.91-0.99, and HR 1.60 (95% CI 1.06-2.41) for ABI of <= 0.90, compared with ABI of 1.10-1.19. Furthermore, a high ABI (>= 1.30) was associated with a greater risk of outcome (HR 2.42 [95% CI 1.14-5.13]). Similar tendencies were observed for CVD events alone and all-cause mortality alone. Addition of ABI to a model with the Framingham risk score marginally improved the c-statistics (p = 0.08) and integrated discrimination improvement (p < 0.05) for the primary outcome.
   Conclusions: The present study suggests that lower and higher ABI are significantly associated with an increased risk of CVD and all-cause mortality in the Japanese population. The ABI, which is easily measured by oscillometry, may be incorporated into daily clinical practice to identify high-risk populations. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Background and aims: Atherosclerosis is a lipid-driven chronic inflammatory disorder of the arteries, and monocytes and macrophages play a central role in this process. Within the atherosclerotic lesion, macrophages can scavenge modified lipids and become the so-called foam cells. We previously reported that the epigenetic enzyme Kdm6b (also known as Jmjd3) controls the pro-fibrotic transcriptional profile of peritoneal foam cells. Given the importance of these cells in atherosclerosis, we now studied the effect of myeloid Kdm6b on disease progression.
   Methods: Bone marrow of myeloid Kdm6b deficient (Kdm6b(del)) mice or wild type littermates (Kdm6b(wt)) was transplanted to lethally irradiated Ldlr(-/-) mice fed a high fat diet for 9 weeks to induce atherosclerosis.
   Results: Lesion size was similar in Kdm6b(wt )and Kdm6b(del) transplanted mice. However, lesions of Kdm6b(del) mice contained more collagen and were more necrotic. Pathway analysis on peritoneal foam cells showed that the pathway involved in leukocyte chemotaxis was most significantly upregulated. Although macrophage and neutrophil content was similar after 9 weeks of high fat diet feeding, the relative increase in collagen content and necrosis revealed that atherosclerotic lesions in Kdm6b(del) mice progress faster.
   Conclusion: Myeloid Kdm6b deficiency results in more advanced atherosclerosis. (C) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.

AB The offspring of women with obesity during their pregnancy are exposed to an altered intra-uterine environment. A subsequent influence on the cardiovascular development during fetal life is assumed. In the present thematic review, we report on the current knowledge about this early development of cardiovascular disease from fetal life until adolescence. Based on animal studies, different contributing mechanisms have been hypothesized that still need confirmation in human subjects. Insulin resistance, increased levels of leptin, chronic inflammatory state, perturbation of sympathetic tone and epigenetic modifications contribute to a suboptimal nutrient environment and changed hemodynamics. The ensuing aberrant cardiomyocyte development, impaired endothelial cell relaxation and atherogenic lipid profile put these children at risk for the development of endothelial cell dysfunction. Increasing possibilities for early detection of this preliminary stage of atherosclerotic disease offer new insights into future prevention and treatment strategies. Future research should focus on further unraveling the effect of moderate intense, aerobic exercise. Since it is used to treat the condition in children and adolescents with good results, it might be a contributor to tackling endothelial cell dysfunction at its cradle when applied in early pregnancy.

AB Primary cilia are microtubule-based organelles that protrude from the cell surface of many mammalian cell types, including endothelial and epithelial cells, osteoblasts, and neurons. These antennal-like projections enable cells to detect extracellular stimuli and elicit responses via intracellular signaling mechanisms. Primary cilia on endothelial cells lining blood vessels function as calcium-dependent mechanosensors that sense blood flow. In doing so, they facilitate the regulation of hemodynamic parameters within the vascular system. Defects in endothelial primary cilia result in inappropriate blood flow-induced responses and contribute to the development of vascular dysfunctions, including atherosclerosis, hypertension, and aneurysms. This review examines the current understanding of vascular endothelial cilia structure and function and their role in the vascular system. Future directions for primary cilia research and treatments for ciliary-based pathologies are discussed. (c) 2018 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Background and aims: We aimed to assess the association of circulating calprotectin, an inflammation-associated protein, with cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk and determine whether it improves risk prediction.
   Methods: Plasma calprotectin measurements were made at baseline in 5290 participants in the PREVEND prospective study. Hazard ratios (95% confidence intervals [CI]) for CVD were calculated.
   Results: After a median follow-up of 8.3 years, 339 first CVD events were recorded. Calprotectin concentration was correlated with several conventional risk factors as well as with high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) (r = 0.42). Calprotectin was log-linearly associated with CVD risk. The risk for CVD adjusted for conventional cardiovascular risk factors was 1.26 (95% CI, 1.13-1.41) per 1 standard deviation higher baseline log e calprotectin, and was 1.24 (95% CI, 1.11-1.39) following further adjustment for triglycerides, body mass index, and other potential confounders. The association remained present after further adjustment for hsCRP 1.15 (95% CI, 1.02-1.30). Comparing extreme quartiles of plasma calprotectin levels, the corresponding adjusted HRs for CVD were 1.96 (1.37-2.82), 1.89 (1.31-2.72), and 1.56 (1.07-2.29). The association of calprotectin with CVD risk did not vary importantly in several relevant clinical subgroups. Adding calprotectin to the Framingham CVD Risk Score was associated with a C-index change (0.0016; p=0.42) difference in -2 log likelihood (p=0.038), IDI (0.0080; p < 0.001), and NRI (4.03%; p=0.024).
   Conclusions: There is a log-linear association of calprotectin concentration with risk of CVD, which may be partly dependent on hsCRP. Adding calprotectin to conventional risk factors improves CVD risk assessment using measures of reclassification and -2 log likelihood. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

   ASSOCIATION
AB Background and aims: Long-term blood pressure variability (BPV) is associated with cardiovascular events independent of mean blood pressure (BP); however, little is known about its predictors.
   Methods: Using data from the CARDIA study, we investigated the association between peak lung-function and long-term BPV in 2917 individuals (mean age 24.8 years, 45.3% males, 58.6% whites) who were not taking antihypertensive medications. Lung-function was measured using forced vital capacity (FVC) and forced expiratory volume in 1-s (FEV1) at years 0, 2, 5, 10 and 20 and the maximum score attained was considered as peak lung-function. Variability independent of the mean (VIM) and coefficient of variation (CV) of BP were calculated to quantify BPV since achieving peak lung-function across 9 visits over 30 years.
   Results: In a multivariate linear regression models, individuals in the 2nd (-0.64 mmHg; 95% CI: -1.06, -0.19), 3rd (-0.96; -1.47, -0.45), and 4th (-0.85: -1.53, -0.17) quartiles of FVC had lower VIM of systolic BP than the those in quartile 1 (p-trend 0.005). CV of systolic BP was also lower by -0.58 (-0.98, -0.19), -0.92 (-1.42, -0.43), and -0.74 (-1.40, -0.08) percentage points, in the three progressively higher quartiles of FVC compared to quartile 1 (p-trend 0.008). Similar findings were observed when the outcome was diastolic BPV. There was no association of FEV1 and FEV1-to-FVC ratio with BPV.
   Conclusions: These findings suggest that smaller lung volume or restrictive lung disease during young adulthood, which result in lower peak FVC, may independently increase the risk of higher long-term BPV during middle adulthood. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Background and aims: Lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] is an emerging genetic risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD). We examined whether plasma Lp(a) concentration and apolipoprotein(a) [apo(a)] isoform size are associated with extent and severity of coronary artery disease (CAD), and the presence of carotid artery plaque.
   Methods: We included in our study male participants (n = 263) from a cohort with angiographically defined premature CAD (Carotid Ultrasound in Patients with Ischemic Heart Disease). The angiographic extent and severity of CAD were determined by the modified Gensini and Coronary Artery Stenosis >= 20% (CAGE) scores. Carotid artery plaque was assessed by bilateral carotid B-mode ultrasound. Apo(a) isoform size was determined by LPA Kringle IV-2 copy number (KIV-2 CN).
   Results: Lp(a) concentration, but not KIV-2 CN, was positively associated with the Gensini score. The association remained significant following adjustment for conventional CVD risk factors (all p <0.05). Lp(a) concentration and elevated Lp(a) [>= 50 mg/dL] were positively associated with the CAGE >= 20 score, independent of conventional CVD risk factors. KIV-2 C N Q1 (lowest KIV-2 CN quartile) was associated with CAGE >= 20 score and KIV-2 CN, with the CAGE >= 20 score in those without diabetes. In multivariate models that included phenotypic familial hypercholesterolemia or low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, Lp(a) concentration, but not KIV-2 CN, was independently associated with the Gensini and CAGE >= 20 scores. No significant associations between Lp(a) concentration and KIV-2 CN with carotid artery plaque were observed.
   Conclusions: Lp(a) concentration, but not apo(a) isoform size, is independently associated with angiographic extent and severity of CAD. Neither Lp(a) nor apo(a) isoform size is associated with carotid artery plaque. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Background and aims: The mechanisms involved in endothelial dysfunction in humans during aging are largely unknown at the level of conduit arteries. We aimed to asses the role of NO and CYP450 epoxygenases-derived epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs) in the regulation of endothelium-dependent flow-mediated dilatation of conduit arteries during aging.
   Methods: Radial artery diameter and mean wall shear stress were determined by echotracking coupled with Doppler in 83 subjects (19-71 years old) during a sustained flow increase induced by hand skin heating, with the brachial infusion of saline or NO-synthase and cytochrome P450 epoxygenase inhibitors (L-NNMA and fluconazole respectively). Local blood sampling was performed for the quantification of NO metabolite nitrite and EETs.
   Results: The magnitude of flow-mediated dilatation was independently and negatively correlated with age, baseline artery diameter and systolic blood pressure, and positively correlated with the increase in shear stress induced by heating. There was an increase in nitrite level during heating until the age of 35 -40 years, which declined thereafter. However, the inhibitory effect of L-NMMA on flow-mediated dilatation progressively decreased during aging, demonstrating a decrease in functional NO availability. Moreover, aging progressively reduced the increase in EET level during heating as well as the inhibitory effect of fluconazole on flow-mediated dilatation.
   Conclusions: These results show that aging impairs the availability of EETs and NO and epoxyeicosatrienoic acids in peripheral conduit arteries, contributing to the development of endothelial dysfunction. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Background and aims: Transforming growth factor beta induced factor homeobox 1 (TGIF1) is a transcriptional repressor that limits the response to transforming growth factor beta signaling and also represses transcription independent of this pathway. Recently, we found higher serum cholesterol levels and more hepatic lipid accumulation in mice lacking Tgif1, and showed that TGIF1 can repress the expression of Soat2, the gene encoding the cholesterol esterifying enzyme acyl-Coenzyme A:cholesterol acyltransferase 2. Although there is evidence that TGIF1 plays a role in lipid metabolism, its role in this metabolic pathway is not fully characterized. Here we investigate whether overexpression of TGIF1 affects intestinal cholesterol absorption.
   Methods and results: TGIF1 was found to repress human and mouse Niemann-Pick Cl like 1 (Npc1l1) promoter activity in intestinal Caco2 cells. We also found TGIF1 to be able to oppose the induction of the promoter activity by sterol regulatory element binding protein 2 and hepatocyte nuclear factor 1 alpha and 4 alpha. To validate these effects of TGIF1 in vivo, we generated transgenic mice specifically overexpressing TGIF1 in the intestine (Villin-Tgif1). We observed lower intestinal expression levels of Npc111 that was associated with lower expression of ATP-binding cassette transporter (Abc) a1, Abcg5, and Abcg8. Villin-Tgif1 mice fed regular chow or a high-fat diet had lower levels of markers of intestinal cholesterol absorption than wild types.
   Conclusions: We suggest TGIF1 as a new player in intestinal cholesterol metabolism. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Adherence to Mediterranean diet, high-sensitive C-reactive protein, and

AB Background and aims: Guidelines recommend a healthy diet as a cornerstone of cardiovascular disease (CVD) prevention. Although the Mediterranean diet (MD) is the best studied dietary pattern for CV outcomes, data on association between MD and severity of CAD are limited. Therefore, we analysed dietary data in association with the SYNTAX score in coronary artery disease (CAD) patients from the INTERCATH study.
   Methods: The INTERCATH study is an observational study in patients undergoing coronary angiography at the University Heart Center Hamburg. Coronary morphology is assessed by the SYNTAX score. A lifestyle questionnaire collects dietary data with food frequency questions at baseline. Based on seven dietary characteristics, we calculated an established Mediterranean diet score (MDS) with a range of 0-28 points at which 28 points reflect maximal adherence to MD. To investigate the association of MD with severity of CAD, we performed logistic regression analysis after adjustment for confounding factors.
   Results: Of 1121 patients, 27% were women. The median age was 70.7 years (interquartile range (IQR) 61.1,77.0). CV risk factors were distributed as expected for a CAD cohort (31.3% diabetes, 81.1% arterial hypertension, 34.0% smoking, median BMI 26.6 kg/m(2)(IQR 24.1, 30.3), median LDL-C 87 mg/dL (IQR 65.0,116,6). Of all variables included, the strongest correlation with MDS was found for log (hs-CRP) (r = -0.21, p <0.001). Adherence to MD represented by a higher MDS was significantly associated with a reduced probability for a medium/high risk SYNTAX score of >= 23 with an odds ratio (OR) of 0.923 per point increase of MDS (95% confidence interval 0.869-0.979; p = 0.0079). This association remained significant after adjustment for cardiovascular risk factors (OR 0.934, 95% CI 0.877-0.995, p = 0.035). After further adjustment for log (hs-CRP), the association remained no longer significant (OR 0.955 (0.893-1.022, p = 0.19).
   Conclusions: In this contemporary data set, we found an independent association of adherence to MD with a less complex CAD. Hs-CRP correlated significantly with adherence to MD and may be a marker of the vasoprotective effects of MD. These results strengthen the evidence for the protective effect of an MD pattern in CVD prevention. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Background and aims: The latest guidelines from the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE) and the American College of Endocrinology (ACE) proposed a new "extreme-risk" category of patients, for whom a low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) level <55 mg/dL (1.4 mmol/L) is advised. We aimed to identify the proportion of patients with stable coronary artery disease (CAD), who are at extreme cardiovascular (CV) risk, and explore how achievable is the new LDL-C goal.
   Methods: We enrolled 1629 consecutive patients <= 80 years with stable CAD. Fasting lipids were determined and patients having probable or definite heterozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia (HeFH) were identified using the Dutch Lipid Clinic Network algorithm.
   Results: The prevalence of risk factors/characteristics suggesting an extreme CV risk were as follows: 32% diabetes mellitus, 33% premature CAD and 9.2% HeFH. In total, 895 (55%) patients had at least one of those risk factors/characteristics and formed the extreme CV risk category. Among patients at extreme risk, 87% were on lipid-lowering therapy, of whom 20.3% had LDL-C <70 mg/dL (1.8 mmol/L) and only 5.3% had LDL-C <55 mg/dL.
   Conclusions: More than half of all patients with stable CAD are at extreme CV risk and very few (similar to 5%) achieve LDL-C levels <55 mg/dL. Using maximally-tolerated high-intensity statin combined with ezetimibe, if necessary, is imperative to bridge the treatment gap, while in selected cases the addition of PCSK9 inhibitors will be required.

AB Background and aims: Several studies have reported that cirrhosis may increase the risk of stroke. However, its association is controversial. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to investigate the relationship between cirrhosis and the risk of stroke.
   Methods: Relevant studies published before December 2017 were identified by searching PubMed, EMBASE, and the ISI Web of Science. The relationships between cirrhosis and the risk of stroke were assessed using relative risk (RR) values and the corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We used the random-effects model proposed by DerSimonian and Laird to quantify the relationship.
   Results: Nine studies investigating the effect of cirrhosis on the risk of stroke were included, totaling 3,855,226 participants (26,199 ischemic stroke, 61,281 hemorrhagic stroke, 100,442 total stroke). Among those, four studies reported data for total stroke, six studies reported on hemorrhagic stroke, and four studies reported on ischemic stroke. The present study indicated a 24% increase in the risk of total stroke among patients with cirrhosis compared with healthy controls (RR: 1.24; 95% CI: 1.01-1.48). Subgroup analyses showed that cirrhosis was associated with increased risk of hemorrhagic stroke (RR: 1.35; 95% CI: 1.06-1.64) but not ischemic stroke (RR: 0.90; 95% CI: 0.41-1.38). Sensitivity analysis and 'trim and fill' method yielded similar results. No evidence of publication bias was observed.
   Conclusions: Cirrhosis was associated with a higher risk of developing stroke, specifically hemorrhage stroke. (c) 2018 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Background and aims: Plasma apolipoprotein M (APOM) is bound to HDL-particles and has anti-atherogenic effects. The present study explored whether plasma APOM is reduced in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), and associated with cardiovascular disease (CVD). In addition, we tested the hypothesis that the excretion of APOM into the urine is increased in patients with kidney disease.
   Methods: Plasma samples were collected from a cohort of patients with CKD stages 1 to 5D (N = 409) and controls (N = 35). Urine was collected from 47 subjects. Plasma APOM was measured with sandwich ELISA and urine APOM with competitive ELISA.
   Results: Plasma APOM levels were reduced in patients with CKD stages 3-5D as compared to patients with CKD stages 1 + 2 and controls (p <0.01). CKD patients with known CVD displayed even further reduction in plasma APOM levels than CKD patients without known CVD (p < 0.001).
   Fast-phase liquid chromatography showed that plasma APOM was primarily associated with HDL-cholesterol (HDL-C) across CKD stages. Accordingly, when plasma APOM values were corrected for HDL-C, a significant difference only persisted between patients with CKD stage 3 and stages 1 + 2 (p < 0.05), and the difference between CKD patients with and without known CVD disappeared. Urine APOM/creatinine ratio was not significantly increased in patients with kidney disease.
   Conclusions: The results show that the difference in plasma APOM levels observed between patients with mild and advanced CKD may mainly be due to differences in plasma HDL-C. Whether APOM plays a role in human uremic atherogenesis warrants further experimental studies. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Background and aims: Acute coronary syndrome (ACS) is commonly caused by rupture or erosion of coronary atherosclerotic plaques and secondary thrombus formation. Metalloproteinase ADAMTS7 was found to play an important role in atherogenesis. This study aimed to explore the association of serum ADAMTS7 levels and rs1994016 polymorphism at ADAMTS7 locus with ACS in a Chinese population.
   Methods: 1881 patients who underwent coronary angiography were consecutively recruited. Among them, 426 patients were matched for case-controlled analysis. Serum ADAMTS7 levels were determined through enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and rs1994016 polymorphism was detected by polymerase chain reaction (PCR).
   Results: Serum ADAMTS7 levels in patients with unstable angina pectoris were much higher than in non-atherosclerotic patients, however, no difference was found among non-atherosclerotic patients, the coronary atherosclerosis subgroup and stable angina pectoris subgroup. A higher serum ADAMTS7 level was found in the ACS group than in the non-ACS group (0.61 +/- 0.04 vs. 0.47 +/- 0.02 ng/mL, p = 0.002) and serum ADAMTS7 level was found to be an independent risk factor for ACS after adjusting for major confounding factors (OR:2.81, 95% CI:1.33-5.93, p = 0.007). ADAMTS7 rs1994016 CT/TT polymorphism was negatively associated with the risk of ACS (OR:0.40, 95% CI:0.22-0.71, p = 0.002). Meanwhile, crossover analysis revealed that in CT/TT homozygotes, ACS risk was reduced nearly 80% in patients with serum ADAMTS7 levels <0.594 ng/mL (Interaction p = 0.002).
   Conclusions: Serum level of ADAMTS7 was positively associated and rs1994016 CT/TT genotype was negatively associated with the risk of ACS. Patients with lower serum ADAMTS7 level and rs1994016 CT/TT genotype are less likely to suffer from ACS in a Chinese population. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Background and aims: The risk factors of cerebral large artery disease (carotid atherosclerosis) have been well recognized, but not of small artery disease, especially leukoaraiosis. In this study, we investigated the risk factors of pure leukoaraiosis (without stroke), and the association with preclinical carotid atherosclerosis.
   Methods: Data from 384 subjects with leukoaraiosis and 379 controls with normal cerebral parenchyma were collected at the Beijing Tiantan Hospital from 1 January, 2009 to 31 December, 2015. Entry criteria: 1) age over 40 years; 2) not taking lipid lowering drugs and vitamin B; 3) normal cerebral parenchyma or leukoaraiosis on brain MRI scan; 4) intra- and extra-cranial large artery stenosis less than 50%. Exclusion criteria: 1) any brain lesions except cerebral leukoaraiosis; 2) severe systemic diseases. Age, gender, well-known vascular risk factors, serum lipid profile, levels of total homocysteine, vitamin B12, folic acid were analyzed with multivariable logistic regression model.
   Results: Age and hypertension, but not serum homocysteine, vitamin B12, folic acid, or serum lipid profile, were independently associated with leukoaraiosis. Furthermore, there was no significant association between pure leukoaraiosis and preclinical carotid atherosclerosis after adjusting for age.
   Conclusions: Only age and hypertension are independently related to pure leukoaraiosis, and there is no association between pure leukoaraiosis and preclinical carotid atherosclerosis. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Background and aims: We demonstrated that dietary ursolic acid (UA) reduces atherosclerotic lesion size and improves kidney function in diabetic mice. Based on structure-function analyses of naturally occurring UA analogs, we synthesized 23-hydroxy ursolic acid (23-OHUA), a compound with structural features predicted to enhance its bioavailability and anti-atherogenic properties compared to UA. The goal of this study was to determine the anti-obesogenic and atheroprotective properties of 23-OHUA and its mechanism of action.
   Methods: We performed chemotaxis assays to determine IC50 of phytochemicals on primed THP-1 monocytes. We fed 12-week old female LDLR(-/- )mice a high-fat diet (HFD) or a HFD supplemented with either 0.05% UA or 0.05% 23-OHUA, and measured monocyte priming, weight gain and atherosclerotic lesion size after 6 and 20 weeks.
   Results: Both dietary UA and 23-OHUA prevented dyslipidemia-induced loss of MKP-1 activity, and hyper-chemotactic activity, hallmarks of blood monocytes priming and dysfunction, but they did not affect plasma lipids or blood glucose levels nor WBC and monocyte counts. After 20 weeks, mice fed 23-OHUA showed 11% less weight gain compared to HFD-fed control mice and a 40% reduction in atherosclerotic plaque size, whereas UA reduced lesion size by only 19% and did not reduce weight gain.
   Conclusions: Dietary 23-OHUA reduces weight gain and attenuates atherogenesis in mice by protecting monocytes against metabolic stress-induced priming and dysfunction. Based on its mechanism of action, 23-OHUA may represent a novel therapeutic approach for the prevention and treatment of obesity and atherosclerosis. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Background and aims: Recurrent pancreatitis is a severe complication of familial chylomicronemia syndrome (FCS) mainly secondary to lipoprotein lipase deficiency. The mechanism and interindividual variability of pancreatitis in FCS are not fully understood, but abnormalities in the drainage system of pancreatic veins could be involved.
   Methods and results: Two cases of typical FCS are described with a past history of recurrent pancreatitis that dramatically improved after splenectomy performed in both cases for reasons non-related to FCS.
   Conclusions: These are the first reports of the disappearance of pancreatitis after splenectomy in FCS and they should be considered of anecdotal nature at this time. The disappearance of pancreatitis following splenectomy could be in part due to subsequent improvements in pancreatic drainage. Extrahepatic portal hypertension induced by hypertriglyceridemic splenomegaly leading to pancreatic congestion could also be a contributing factor. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Background and aims: The relationship between serum uric acid (UA) and the risk of intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) remains controversial. The aim of our systematic review and meta-analysis was to ascertain the association between serum UA concentrations and the risk of ICH.
   Methods: We systematically searched databases of Embase, Pubmed, Web of Science and Cochrane Library up to December 30, 2017, and additional papers were identified through a manual search. Mean difference (MD) for serum UA levels with 95% confidence intervals (CI) was calculated. Six studies, including 345 ICH patients, 574 ischemic stroke patients and 535 healthy controls, were identified for meta-analysis.
   Results: Our results revealed no statistically significant differences in the comparison of UA between ICH and healthy controls (95% CI = -9.04-15.61); UA levels in patients with ischemic stroke were significantly higher than those in healthy controls (95% CI = 3.91-56.32); further subgroup analysis of age showed higher UA levels in ICH patients over 65 years than healthy controls (age -65: 95% CI = 1.44-35.96). Subgroup of ethnicity (Asians: CI = -9.06-21.00; Caucasians: 95% CI = -68.43-8.43), gender (Men: 95% CI = -56.08-4.73; Women: 95% CI = -27.19-35.91) and sample size (large samples: 95% CI = -20.54-41.05; small samples: 95% CI = -25.41-13.78) with respect to UA levels between ICH and healthy controls did not change these results.
   Conclusions: This meta-analysis showed that serum UA levels did not increase the risk of ICH probably because of the dual roles of UA, i.e. pro-oxidant and antioxidant, in the progression of atherosclerosis. However, serum UA may be a potential risk factor for ICH in the elderly. There were no race-specific differences in UA levels between Asians and Caucasians as well as gender-related differences between men and women in the risk of ICH. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB Background and aims: Dysregulation of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) has been proven to be involved in the pathogenesis of coronary artery disease (CAD). However, it remains to be extensively explored. Thus, the present study aims to study expression patterns, biological functions, and diagnostic value of lncRNAs in CAD.
   Methods: Using microarray, we performed the transcriptome-wide lncRNA and mRNAs expression profile of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of 93 CAD patients and 48 healthy controls. Gene Ontology (GO) and pathway analysis for differentially expressed mRNAs were used to investigate underlying biological associations of differentially expressed lncRNAs, and path-net was created to depict interactions of significant pathways. qRT-PCR was used to validate selected lncRNAs in 412 CAD patients and 295 healthy controls. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was performed to evaluate whether lncRNAs could be used in the diagnosis of CAD patients. Finally, the functional significance of validated lncRNAs was determined in THP-1-derived macrophages.
   Results: We identified 1210 lncRNAs and 890 mRNAs differentially expressed from the expression profile and validated 7 lncRNAs. Two novel lncRNA biomarkers, ENST00000444488.1 and uc010yfd.1, together with CAD risk factors, had the better performance for discrimination of CAD patients from healthy controls, and ENST00000444488.1 could diagnose acute myocardial infarction (AMI) patients. The knockdown of 20 ENST00000444488.1, uc010yfd.1, ASO3973 and ENST00000602558.1 affected the expression of inflammation-related genes and their nearby genes in THP-1-derived macrophages, respectively.
   Conclusions: We offered a transcriptome-wide overview of aberrantly expressed lncRNAs in CAD patients, and identified two novel lncRNA biomarkers for diagnosing CAD. Loss of validated lncRNAs regulated the expression of inflammation-related genes and their nearby genes. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) is a well-accepted causal risk factor for athero-thrombotic cardiovascular disease, as demonstrated in large epidemiological studies, including Mendelian randomization data. Several randomized controlled trials and meta-analyzes have shown that lipid lowering therapies, such as statins and more recently the non-statin agents ezetimibe and Proprotein Convertase Subtilisin Kexin type 9 (PCSK9) monoclonal antibodies (mAb), reduce cardiovascular events across a broad range of baseline LDL-C levels. Over time, the recommended target for LDL-C has become more stringent, moving from 2.6 mmol/l to 1.8 mmol/l in very high-risk patients. It is currently recommended to start high intensity statin treatment immediately after acute coronary syndromes (ACS) to maximally and rapidly reduce LDL-C. The novel treatment options enable the achievement of very low LDL-C levels below 1 mmol/l, with no reported safety issues, in particular with regard to neurocognitive events. However, current evidence supports the use of PCSK9 mAb treatment in ACS patients only after an initial 2-3 month run-up treatment adaptation period with maximally tolerated statin. The use of PCSK9 mAb immediately in the acute phase of ACS (<1 month) remains to be studied. Some data suggest that circulating PCSK9 increases coronary plaque vulnerability, inflammation as well as platelet aggregation in the acute phase of ACS, potentially justifying earlier PSCK9 mAb treatment initiation. As the use of novel treatment combinations in ACS is further explored to widen the perspectives of a more personalized approach for the management of ACS based on individual patient risk profile and baseline LDL-C values, their relative cost-effectiveness will also need to be assessed.

AB Background and aims: Acute ischemia is associated with myocardial endothelial damage and microvessel formation, resulting in leakage of plasma albumin into the myocardial extravascular space. In this study, we tested whether an albumin-binding intravascular contrast agent (gadofosveset) allows for improved quantification of myocardial permeability compared to the conventional extracellular contrast agent Gd-DTPA using late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) and T1 mapping in vivo.
   Methods: MI was induced in C57BL/6 mice (n = 6) and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) was performed at 3, 10 and 21 days post-MI using Gd-DTPA and 24 h later using gadofosveset. Functional, LGE and T1 mapping protocols were performed 45 min post-injection of the contrast agent.
   Results: LGE images showed that both contrast agents provided similar measurements of infarct area at all time points following MI. Importantly, the myocardial R-1 measurements after administration of gadofosveset were higher in the acute phase-day 3 (R1 [s(-1)] = 6.29 +/- 0.29) compared to the maturation phase-days 10 and 21 (R1 [s(-1)] = 4.76 +/- 0.30 and 4.48 +/- 0.14), suggesting that the uptake of this agent could be used to stage myocardial remodeling. No differences in myocardial R1 were observed after administration of Gd-DTPA at different time points post-MI (R1 [s(-1)] = 3d: 3.77 +/- 0.37; 10d: 2.74 +/- 0.06; 21d: 3.35 +/- 0.26). The MRI results were validated by ex vivo histology that showed albumin leakage in the myocardium in the acute phase and microvessel formation at later stages.
   Conclusions: We demonstrate the merits of an albumin-binding contrast agent for monitoring changes in myocardial permeability between acute ischemia and chronic post-MI myocardial remodeling. (C) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Background and aims: LPCAT3 plays a major role in phospholipid metabolism in the liver and intestine. However, the impact of LPCAT3 on hematopoietic cell and macrophage functions has yet to be described. Our aim was to understand the functions of LPCAT3 in macrophages and to investigate whether LPCAT3 deficiency in hematopoietic cells may affect atherosclerosis development.
   Methods: Mice with constitutive Lpcat3 deficiency (Lpcat3(-/-)) were generated. We used fetal hematopoietic liver cells to generate WT and Lpcat3(-/-) macrophages in vitro and to perform hematopoietic cell transplantation in recipient Ldlr(-/-) mice.
   Results: Lpcat3-deficient macrophages displayed major reductions in the arachidonate content of phosphatidylcholines, phosphatidylethanolamines and, unexpectedly, plasmalogens. These changes were associated with altered cholesterol homeostasis, including an increase in the ratio of free to esterified cholesterol and a reduction in cholesterol efflux in Lpcat3(-/-) macrophages. This correlated with the inhibition of some DM-regulated pathways, related to altered cellular availability of the arachidonic acid. Indeed, LPCAT3 deficiency was associated with decreased Abca1, Abcg1 and ApoE mRNA levels in fetal liver cells derived macrophages. In vivo, these changes translated into a significant increase in atherosclerotic lesions in Ldlr(-/- )mice with hematopoietic LPCAT3 deficiency.
   Conclusions: This study identifies LPCAT3 as a key factor in the control of phospholipid homeostasis and arachidonate availability in myeloid cells and underlines a new role for LPCAT3 in plasmalogen metabolism. Moreover, our work strengthens the link between phospholipid and sterol metabolism in hematopoietic cells, with significant consequences on nuclear receptor-regulated pathways and atherosclerosis development.

AB Background and aims: Diabetes mellitus is a coronary heart disease (CHD) risk-equivalent for the outcome of peripheral vascular disease. The impact of diabetes with comorbid risk factors on the outcome of peripheral vascular disease remains unexplored.
   Methods: We performed a cross-sectional analysis of participants in Lifeline Vascular Screening Inc. age 40-90 who were screened for peripheral vascular disease, defined as lower extremity peripheral artery disease (PAD, ABI <0.9) and/or carotid artery stenosis (CAS, internal CAS >= 50%). CHD was defined as prior myocardial infarction or revascularization. Risk factors included hypertension, hyperlipidemia, smoking, obesity, sedentary lifestyle and family history of cardiovascular disease.
   Results: Among 3,517,804 participants, PAD and CAS was identified in 4.4% and 3.7%, respectively. Diabetes was identified in 376,528 participants, 324,680 (86%) of whom did not have CHD. Among diabetic participants without CHD, prevalence of PAD increased with 1-2 (4.3%), 3-4 (7.3%), and >= 5 (12.0%) comorbid risk factors (p trend < 0.0001). The pattern was similar for CAS (3.7%, 6.2%, 8.8%, p trend < 0.0001). Compared to participants without diabetes, those with diabetes and 1-2, 3-4 and >= 5 risk factors had increasing odds of PAD and CAS after adjustment for age, sex and race/ethnicity (1.0, 95% CI 0.98-1.06; 1.8, 95% CI 1.8-1.89; 3.5, 95% CI 3.43-3.64, respectively, p trend < 0.0001). By comparison, in nondiabetic participants, CHD increased odds of PAD and CAS by 2-fold (2.06, 95% CI 2.02-2.1; 2.19, 95% CI 2.15-2.23 respectively).
   Conclusions: Diabetes, particularly with comorbid risk factors, confers increased odds of PAD and CAS, even in the absence of CHD. Counseling regarding screening and prevention for peripheral vascular disease among individuals with diabetes and multiple risk factors may be useful. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Background and aims: Recent advancements in coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) have allowed for the quantitative measurement of high-risk lipid rich plaque. Determination of the optimal threshold for Hounsfield units (HU) by CCTA for identifying lipid rich plaque remains unknown. We aimed to validate reliable cut-points of HU for quantitative assessment of lipid rich plaque.
   Methods: 8 post-mortem sudden coronary death hearts were evaluated with CCTA and histologic analysis. Quantitative plaque analysis was performed in histopathology images and lipid rich plaque area was defined as intra-plaque necrotic core area. CCTA images were analyzed for quantitative plaque measurement. Low attenuation plaque (LAP) was defined as any pixel <30, 45, 60, 75, and 90 HU cut-offs within a coronary plaque. The area of LAP was calculated in each cross-section.
   Results: Among 105 cross-sections, 37 (35.2%) cross-sectional histology images contained lipid rich plaque. Although the highest specificity for identifying lipid rich plaque was shown with <30 HU cut-off (88.2%), sensitivity (e.g. 55.6% for <75 HU, 16.2% for <30 HU) and negative predictive value (e.g. 75.9% for <75 HU, 65.9% for <30 HU) tended to increase with higher HU cut-offs. For quantitative measurement, <75 HU showed the highest correlation coefficient (0.292, p = 0.003) and no significant differences were observed between lipid rich plaque area and LAP area between histology and CT analysis (Histology: 0.34 +/- 0.73 mm(2), QCT: 0.37 +/- 0.71 mm(2), p = 0.701).
   Conclusions: LAP area by CCTA using a <75 HU cut-off value demonstrated high sensitivity and quantitative agreement with lipid rich plaque area by histology analysis. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Background and aims: Familial hypercholesterolaemia (FH) is widely underdiagnosed. Cascade testing (CT) of relatives has been shown to be feasible, acceptable and cost-effective in the UK, but requires a supply of index cases. Feasibility of universal screening (US) at age 1-2 years was recently demonstrated. We examined whether this would be a cost-effective adjunct to CT in the UK, given the current and plausible future undiagnosed FH prevalence.
   Methods: Seven cholesterol and/or mutation-based US reverse cascade testing (RCT) alternatives were compared with no US in an incremental analysis with a healthcare perspective. A decision model was used to estimate costs and outcomes for cohorts exposed to the US component of each strategy. RCT case ascertainment was modelled using recent UK CT data, and probabilistic Markov models estimated life-time costs and health outcomes for the cohorts screened under each alternative. 1000 Monte Carlo simulations were run for each model, and average outcomes reported. Further uncertainty was explored deterministically. Threshold analysis investigated the association between undiagnosed FH prevalence and cost-effectiveness.
   Results: A strategy involving cholesterol screening followed by diagnostic genetic testing and RCT was the most cost-effective modelled (incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) versus no US (sic)12,480/ quality adjusted life year (QALY); probability of cost-effectiveness 96.8% at (sic)20,000/QALY threshold). Cost-effectiveness was robust to both deterministic sensitivity analyses and threshold analyses that modelled ongoing case ascertainment at theoretical maximum levels.
   Conclusions: These findings support implementation of universal cholesterol screening followed by diagnostic genetic testing and RCT for FH, under a UK conventional willingness-to-pay threshold. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Aims: In this study we evaluated the effect of mipomersen in patients with severe LDL-hypercholesterolaemia and atherosclerosis treated by lipid lowering drugs and regular lipoprotein apheresis.
   Methods: This prospective, randomized, controlled phase II single centre trial enrolled 15 patients (9 males, 6 females; 59 +/- 9ys, BMI 27 +/- 4kg/m(2)) with established atherosclerosis, LDL-cholesterol >= 130mg/dL(3.4mmol/L) despite maximal possible drug therapy, and fulfilling German criteria for regular lipoprotein apheresis. All patients were on stable lipid lowering drug therapy and regular apheresis for >3 months. Patients randomized to treatment (n = 11) self-injected mipomersen 200mg sc weekly at day 4 after apheresis for 26 weeks. Patients randomized to control (n = 4) continued apheresis without injection. The primary endpoint was the change in pre-apheresis LDL-cholesterol.
   Results: Of the patients randomized to mipomersen 3 discontinued the drug early (<12 weeks therapy) for side effects. For these another 3 were recruited and randomized. Further 4 patients discontinued mipomersen between 12 and 26 weeks for side effects (moderate to severe injection site reactions n = 3 and elevated liver enzymes n = 1). In those treated for >12 weeks, mipomersen reduced pre-apheresis LDL-cholesterol significantly by 22.6 +/- 17.0%, from a baseline of 4.8 +/- 1.2mmol/L to 3.7 +/- 0.9mmol/L, while there was no significant change in the control group (+1.6 +/- 9.3%), with the difference between the groups being significant (p = 0.006). Mipomersen also decreased preapheresis lipoprotein(a) (Lp(a)) concentration from a median baseline of 40.2mg/dL (32.5,71) by 15% (-19.4,3.6) though without significance (p = 0.3).
   Conclusions: Mipomersen reduces LDL-cholesterol (significantly) and Lp(a) (non-significantly) in patients on maximal lipid-lowering drug therapy and regular apheresis but often is associated with side effects.
