AB There is lack of knowledge in assimilation of multi-sensor, multi-modal water temperature observations into hydrodynamic models of shallow rivers, specifically, (a) how does accuracy of shallow river model improve after assimilation of in-situ and remotely sensed temperature observations, and (b) how can data from disparate sensors and sources be assimilated into the prediction model without significant increase in computational burden. Multi-sensor, multi-modal observations used in this study are obtained from in-situ monitoring devices in the river with limited spatial coverage but dense temporal resolution, and from Landsat-7 satellite that has better spatial coverage but limited temporal coverage. Use of remotely-sensed observations from satellites poses the challenge that the physical region represented by satellite data does not directly correspond with the physical domain of the river simulated in hydrodynamic models. Satellites detects the skin water temperature, whereas numerical models estimate the bulk temperature in the surface layer that may be multiple meters in thickness. Furthermore, for rivers narrower than the resolution of satellite data, the temperature of each cell represents the weighted average temperature of land and water. These factors introduce biases into the updated numerical model, thereby impeding appropriate management of temperature, water quality, and aquatic ecology. We implemented an efficient ensemble Kalman filter method using Latin-hypercube sampling to assimilate multisensor water temperature observations into the hydrodynamic model of the Lower Klamath River located in northern California. Assimilation of remote sensing data from Landsat-7 improved the model prediction for the entire river. The average spatial error was reduced from 2.59 degrees C to 0.66 degrees C (i.e., 75% improvement). In-situ data assimilation reduced the error at the observation location, however, error in the water temperature predicted by the updated model reverted in less than two days to the same level as that of an un-updated model. On the other hand, it is not computationally efficient to assimilate all of the available data into the model as they become available. In order to overcome these challenges, in-situ data were adaptively assimilated into the model whenever the error exceeded a maximum allowable error. Adaptive assimilation of in-situ data for the Lower Klamath river application occurred one to three times per day, and reduced the average daily error up to 58% compared to assimilation of in-situ data only once each day.

AB An increase in atmospheric CO2 concentration (CO2) affects stomatal conductance (g(s)). Since g(s) is an important parameter in the Penman-Monteith model (P-M), an accurate estimate of g, can improve the accuracy of the estimation of evapotranspiration (ET) by P-M when CO2 increases. This paper identifies three models of the relationship between g(s) and CO2 (the linear model, L, the hyperbolic model, H, and the modified hyperbolic model, MH), and compares their estimations of ET when they are incorporated into P-M. A two-year experiment which included four levels (400, 550, 700, and 900 mu mol mol(-1)) and three levels (400, 550, and 700 mu mol mol(-1)) of CO2 in 2015 and 2016, respectively, was conducted in order to obtain validation data. Fifty papers that had studied the effect of increased CO2 on g(s), over a 45-year period, were analyzed to obtain calibration data. After being calibrated and validated, each of the three models was in turn included as a component of P-M to estimate ET under increased CO2, followed by the comparison between estimated and observed ET. The sensitivity of P-M to the parameters in three models was also analyzed. Our results show that g, decreased and the reduction rate gradually lessened as CO2 increased. Of the three models, MH gave the best estimate of g(s), having the largest values of the coefficient of determination (R-2), 0.97, the Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient (NSE), 0.96, and the modified affinity index (d), 0.93, and the smallest values of the root mean square error (RMSE), 0.03, and the Akaike information criterion (AIC), - 47.48. Each of the three models gave different ET results for different levels of CO2 when used as a component of P-M. The MH had better ET estimations than L and H when compared to observed ET across all CO2 concentration levels, with the highest R-2, NSE, and d, and the lowest RMSE and MC. The sensitivity of P-M to the empirical parameters varied among the three models, for instance, +/- 40 and +/- 20% changes of parameter p in L, g(smaxp), and and C-s0 in H, and b in MH resulted in -15 to 4%, -13 to 7%, - 9 to 4%, and - 3 to 3% changes in predicted ET, respectively. Thus, changes of parameter b in MH had minimum effect on predicted ET, indicating greater stability of P-M in ET estimation by incorporating MH. Therefore, using MH to model the response of g(s) to increased CO2 when incorporated into P-M to estimate ET not only represents a more appropriate stomata physiological reaction to higher CO2, but also results in a more accurate estimate of ET, and making the model more broadly applicable.

AB Nowadays, alteration of the natural flow regime is considered one the most widespread and damaging impacts for river ecosystems. Hence, increasing our understanding of large-scale hydrological alteration patterns would help us design more effective water use policies. The present study aims to establish general patterns of hydrological alteration caused by dams on a national level, with Spain as a case study. First, we developed a classification of the natural flow regime of the Spanish river network, which served as the reference to assess the degree of hydrological alteration of 139 altered-river gauges. In addition, using the flow series of the altered-river gauges we defined a set of 7 types of altered regimes (TARs), which allowed the stratification of the analyses. The results revealed that the magnitude and direction of hydrological alteration depended on the natural flow class of the altered rivers. In this regard, major effects of dams on Spanish rivers were related to the modification of the intra-annual variability of daily flow, the magnitude of seasonal maximum and minimum flows and the patterns of high flow events. Our results also showed that the distribution of the TARS partially followed a geographic order, but associations between TARs and natural flow classes were not straightforward. In addition, we highlighted that the nature of the hydrological alteration was independent of the registered dam uses.

TI Approaches for estimating unsaturated soil hydraulic conductivities at

ID WATER-RETENTION; TILLAGE; FLOW
AB The Mualem-van Genuchten model has been widely used for estimating unsaturated soil hydraulic conductivity (K-u) from measured saturated hydraulic conductivity (K-s) and fitted water retention curve (WRC) parameters. Soil bulk density (p(b)) variations affect the accuracy of K-u estimates. In this study, we extend the Mualem-van Genuchten model to account for the p(b) effect with p(b)-related WRC and K-s models. We apply two functions (A and B) that relate the van Genuchten WRC model to p(b) and two models (1 and 2) that estimate K-s with various p(b). By combining the p(b)-related WRC functions and K-s models, we develop four integrated approaches (i.e., A1, A2, B1, and B2) for estimating K-u at various p(b). K-u measurements made on five soils with various textures and p(b) are used to evaluate the accuracy of the four approaches. The results show that all approaches produce reasonable K-u estimates, with average root mean square errors (RMSEs) less than 0.35 (expressed in dimensionless unit because logarithmic K-u values are used). Approach A2, with an average RMSE of 0.25, agrees better with K-u measurements than does Approach A1 that has an average RMSE of 0.28. This is because Model 2 accounts for the WRC shape effect near saturation. Approaches A1 and A2 give more accurate K-u estimates than do Approaches B1 and B2 which both have average RMSEs of 0.35, because Function A performs better in estimating WRCs than does Function B. The proposed approaches could be incorporated into simulation models for improved prediction of water, solute, and gas transport in soils.

ID MURRAY-DARLING BASIN; TECHNOLOGY ADOPTION; AGRICULTURE; MARKETS;

AB There has been increasing emphasis by scholars in trying to understand how neighbors influence farmers' decision-making. In Australia, historically there has always been strong anecdotal evidence of peer pressure on irrigators' decisions to not sell permanent water entitlements. This local pressure increased with the advent of the federal government into the Murray-Darling Basin water market to purchase permanent water for the environment from voluntary sellers from 2008 onwards. Selling permanent water entitlements is associated with perceptions about rural community decline. This article formally tests whether a neighborhood effect can be detected in permanent water entitlement selling decisions, using farm survey data across a number of years from the southern Murray-Darling Basin (n = 1462). We hypothesize that the more that an irrigator's neighbors sell permanent water in a given area, the more likely that an individual irrigator will also sell permanant water given a decrease in social pressure. Irrigators' locations were geocoded and locational characteristics (regional socio-economic characteristics, land and water quality) were linked to the survey data covering farm, farmer and water trade characteristics. There was significant evidence of a farmer neighborhood effect, with higher likelihood of permanent water sales occurring in areas where more neighbors had sold permanent water, holding other locational and spatial influences constant.

AB A hybrid numerical, finite differences and semi-analytical/empirical model has been developed to evaluate the spatial and time scale of chemical weathering along a fracture in quartz sandstones. The model is based on the diffusion transport occurring from the bedrock mass toward the fracture walls driven by the SiO2 concentration gradient between water in the bedrock pores (high silica content) and water flowing in the fracture (low silica content). Because of molecular diffusion, intergranular water becomes undersaturated with respect to silica. This promotes dissolution of quartz at grain boundaries and results in a porosity profile decreasing from the fracture walls toward the rock interior. Bedrock individual grains are released and gradually removed by the water flowing into the fracture when a critical value of porosity is reached (Grain Release Threshold, GRT): this process drastically increases the fracture enlargement rate.
   The model outcomes establish a minimum time of 90 ka to reach the GRT. This time is independent of length, aperture and dip of the fracture, but is controlled by parameters such as the initial fracture aperture, water temperature, quartz grain size, and initial bedrock porosity. It is attested that the water flowing in the fracture remains undersaturated with respect to silica over very long timescales (in the order of 10(5) years) and over very long flow paths. In turn, this suggests that the extremely slow reaction between quartz and water is the key-factor for the formation of subterranean karst-like features in quartz sandstone, otherwise silica saturation would be reached after short distances and deep weathering in this lithology would be prevented.
   Finally, the model outcomes were compared to field data from the Gran Sabana caves (Venezuela) and other quartz sandstone weathering landforms elsewhere, showing that dissolution/diffusion in the rock matrix is a reliable mechanism for the formation of these peculiar karst-like features.

AB Southwestern Australia has experienced recent climate change, with an increase in air temperature of 0.6 degrees C and a reduction in mean annual precipitation of -15% since 1970. Along with the warming and drying trends, dramatic declines of streamflow have occurred across the region. However, both forest mortality and an increase in leaf area index have been observed in the southwestern forest, suggesting varied responses of vegetation to climate change. In this study, 30 catchments were analyzed using the Mann-Kendall trend test, Pettitt's change point test and the theoretical framework of the Budyko curve to study the rainfall-runoff relationship change, and effects of climate and land cover change on streamflow. A declining trend and relatively consistent change point (2000) of streamflow were found in most catchments, with 14 catchments showing significant declines (p < 0.05, - 68.1% to - 35.6%) over 1970-2000 and 2001-2015. Most of the catchments have been shifting towards a more water-limited climate condition since 2000. For the period 1970 to 2015, the dynamic of vegetation attributes (land cover/use change and growth of vegetation) dominated the decrease of streamflow in about half the study catchments. In general, a coequal role of climate and vegetation on the decline in streamflow was found in the study, suggesting the importance of vegetation management on future water management and production. Precipitation is predicted to decline in the future; therefore, some forest management intervention is required to maintain forest growth and water supply in the southwest of Australia.

AB Understanding energy exchange between the atmosphere and the Earth's surface is crucial. We observed the patterns of energy exchange between the atmosphere and a subalpine meadow in the Qilian Mountains, northwest China over the period of 2014 to 2016. Annual variations in energy exchange in study area exhibited drastic differences during time periods of frozen soil and non-frozen soil. Specifically, more than 80% and 28% of net radiation (R-n) were converted to sensible heat (H) during the frozen and non-frozen soil periods, respectively, whereas approximately 17% and 35% of R-n were converted to latent heat (LE) during the frozen and non-frozen soil periods, respectively. The non-frozen soil period was divided into the pre-growth period, the growth period, and the post-growth period. The high Bowe ratio (beta) values of the pre-growth period were 4.34, 3.60, and 8.39 in 2014, 2015 and 2016, respectively. In general, rapid increases in R-n during this period increased the values of H, LE, and soil heat flux (G). The growth period was defined by a low beta value that fluctuated between 0.3 and 0.4. The average beta values for the post-growth period during 2014, 2015, and 2016 were 1.49, 3.12, and 2.37, respectively. The high decoupling coefficient (Omega) for the growth period indicated that the contribution of R-n to LE was greater than that of vapor pressure deficit (VPD). The small value of Omega during the other periods indicated that the effect of VPD on LE dominated that of other factors. The seasonal patterns of energy exchange showed that vegetation phenology is the major factor that affects energy partitioning significantly in the alpine meadow ecosystem in the Qilian Mountains. The annual energy partitioning in the same ecosystem over 3 years was not constant, and climate may be the main factor that influences interannual variations in energy exchange.

AB Determining how wells in fractured crystalline bedrock are interconnected is essential in defining contaminant flow paths and in interpreting water quality data from wells. Although various tracers and geophysical techniques have been used with success, the high cost or logistics may restrict their implementation. This study demonstrates a low-cost technique for identifying fracture connections between wells by combining the dissolved oxygen alteration method (DOAM) with cross borehole hydraulic pumping tests, Following the alteration of the dissolved oxygen (DO) profile in the observation well through bubbler aeration, an interconnected well is pumped, which results in changes in borehole flow in the aerated observation well. The DO profile in the observation well is monitored over time to characterize the changes in borehole flow and identify fractures that hydraulically connect to the pumping well. The method was demonstrated at three test sites in Storrs, Connecticut. Each site has two or three interconnecting wells in fractured crystalline bedrock and varying flow conditions. The DOAM successfully identified interconnecting fractures in wells 15-84 m apart.

AB With the boom of hydropower industry, it has never been more important than now to re-assess approaches to a sustainable hydropower projects management. We evaluated the environmental and economic costs and benefits (namely environmental and economic effects) of implementing different hydrology-based environmental flow restrictions (i.e., environmental flows scenarios) at nine run-of-river power plants involving flow diversions, located at pluvial, nival and stable river reaches in Spain. For each scenario, economic effects were inferred from energy production figures, whereas environmental effects along the bypassed river reach came from the deviations of the ecologically meaningful flow attributes from the unaltered flow regime. We found a linear inverse relationship between both effects, which were the lowest for the pluvial type reaches. Imposing significantly low constant flows resulted into the highest energy production but at the highest environmental costs, whereas the opposite happened when using more complex environmental flow methodologies which also imposed flow fluctuations and annual floods, and restricted ramping rates. The ecologically meaningful flow attributes were not similarly affected in all tested environmental flows scenarios. We present a simple approach to define the environmental flow standards at run-of-river-diversion schemes that guarantee the right balance between rivers conservation and energy production, and which are valid for all rivers sharing similar flow regime patterns. In such definition it is possible to address specific ecological goals by prioritizing the naturalness of certain key flow attributes.

AB Understanding how tropical montane catchments store and release water, and the resulting water ecosystem services they provide is crucial for improving water resource management. But while research in high-elevation tropical environments has made progress in defining streamflow generation processes, we still lack fundamental knowledge regarding water storage characteristics of catchments. Here we explore catchment storage and the factors controlling its spatial variability in seven Paramo catchments (0.20-7.53 km(2)) in southern Ecuador. We applied a field-based approach using hydrometeorological, water stable isotopic, and soils hydrophysical data from a 3 year collection period to estimate the passive (PasS) and dynamic (DynS) storage of the catchments. We also investigated relations between these storages and landscape and hydrometric variables using linear regression analysis. Pass estimates from hydrophysical soil properties and soil water mean transit times were consistent with estimates using streamflow mean transit times. Computed catchment PasS and DynS for the seven watersheds were 313-617 mm and 29-35 mm, respectively. PasS increased directly with the areal proportion of Histosol soils and cushion plant vegetation (wetlands). DynS increased linearly with precipitation intensity. Importantly, only 6-10% of the mixing storage of the catchments (DynS/PasS) was hydrologically active in their water balance. Wetlands internal to the catchments were important for PasS, where constant input of low intensity precipitation sustained wetlands recharge, and thus, the water regulation capacity (i.e., year-round water supply) of Paramo catchments. Our findings provide new insights into the factors controlling the water regulation capacity of Paramo catchments and other peaty soils dominated environments.

AB High spatial resolution soil moisture information is important for hydrological, climatic and agricultural applications. The lack of high resolution soil moisture data over large areas at the required accuracy is a major impediment for such applications. This study investigates the feasibility of downscaling satellite soil moisture products to 1 km resolution. This study was undertaken in the semi-arid Goulbum River Catchment, located in south-eastern Australia. The Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP)-Enhanced 9 km (L3SMP-E) and Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) 25 km gridded (SMOS CATDS L3 SM 3-DAY) radiometric products were compared with in-situ soil moisture observations and a regression tree model was developed for downscaling based on thermal inertia theory. Observations from a long-term soil moisture monitoring network were employed to develop a regression tree model between the diurnal temperature difference and the daily mean soil moisture for soils with different clay content and vegetation greenness. Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) land surface temperatures were used to estimate the soil moisture at high spatial resolution by disaggregating the satellite soil moisture products through the regression model. The downscaled SMAP-Enhanced 9 km and SMOS 25 km gridded soil moisture products showed unbiased root mean square errors (ubRMSE) of 0.07 and 0.05 cm(3)/cm(3), respectively, against the in-situ data. These ubRMSEs include errors caused by measuring instrument and the scale mismatch between downscaled products and in-situ data. An RMSE of 0.07 cm(3)/cm(3) was observed when comparing the downscaled soil moisture against the passive airborne L-band retrievals. The findings here auger well for the use of satellite remote sensing for the assessment of high resolution soil moisture.

AB Increasing pressure on river catchment water resources has heightened the need for real-time monitoring data for water management agencies and users. This study investigates the capability to develop a technical basis for water co-management at the catchment scale. A web application (dashboard) was created that displayed real-time data for weather, soil water, river flow and water quality at high spatial and temporal resolutions, including streamflow and rainfall forecasts. A method to predict stream water temperature was developed and tested using an interactive table for visualisation of complex data. The dashboard was used to provide information and alerting to water users in an agricultural catchment, through the Ringarooma Water Users Group (RWUG) in NE Tasmania, Australia. The dashboard was updated several times per day using telemetry and data platform services, and accessed by RWUG members mainly during periods of low flow when water extraction restrictions can be applied. Irrigators gained an improved understanding of streamflow behaviour in response to weather variability, and water extractions and releases, and developed abilities to voluntarily manage the water resource as three sub-groups. The Department of Primary Industries, Parks, Water and Environment (DPIPWE) collaborated with the RWUG in this adaptive management approach, as enabled by the Ringarooma River Catchment Water Management Plan, and later informed a new Ministerial Policy for 'Water Resource Management During Extreme Dry Conditions'. Group management was assisted by using alerts sent through the existing DPIPWE text messaging service. Results showed that stakeholder understanding of technical information and scenario implications using the sensor-based dashboard increased capacity of irrigators to make decisions that improve production and social outcomes, while considering environmental values. This study demonstrates that the information provided through the dashboard enabled a high level of community and inter-agency co-operation, demonstrating potential to apply this management approach in other catchments.

AB The nonlinear dynamics of streamflow time series from 667 reference hydrometric stations in North America spanning the pluvial-nival hydrological continuum are explored using minimum embedding dimensions as determined by False Nearest Neighbor (FNN) methods. Simulations using synthetic time series demonstrate that snowmelt dominated time series have lower embedding dimensions than those that are rainfall dominated, and that mixtures of the two processes result in a nearly linear change in the embedding dimension. The majority of the reference hydrometric stations drop below a 1% threshold at a dimension less than 30, showing a high degree of natural complexity in the signals ranging from annual snowmelt to weather-driven pseudo-stochastic systems. A less restrictive threshold, 5% is suggested to be more appropriate for streamflow time series. Time series smoothing impacts the embedding dimension and over-smoothing results in incorrect reductions of embedding dimensions. The relationship of the embedding dimensions to watershed and statistical properties of streamflow record showed the lowest embedding dimensions are restricted to large drainage areas, high elevations, and large mean annual flows and variance, high autocorrelations, and large fractions of the records with only small changes in magnitude. Times series that have a large proportion of consecutive days of equal streamflow typically result in higher embedding dimensions. Mapping of the embedding dimension shows spatial patterns related to the streamflow generating processes and geographical features. The use of embedding dimension resolved different dynamics across the hydrological continuum for rainfall to snowmelt over many climate zones. Changes in the embedding dimension might indicate process changes related to climate variability and change.

AB An important knowledge gap in current urban hydrological models are reliable, generic data about interception storage capacities of small urban plant species. These data are crucial to calculate interception losses and learning their effect on the urban hydrological cycle. This study addresses this knowledge gap through simulating rainfall events in an ex-situ, controlled environment on several urban plant species. Four plant species, Lonicera nitida, Lavandula angustifolia, Pennisetum alopecuroides and a grass mix were selected based on their abundance in urban environments and their morphological differences. Several vegetation characteristics such as height and diameter were altered to create as much variation as possible in the dataset to determine the underlying characteristics influencing the interception storage capacity. Estimating the interception storage capacity of each plant (S-p) using multiple linear regression models, biomass (B-p) was found to be the most important predictor variable for all species. Therefore predictive models to estimate the biomass of an individual plant were developed, using some easy to measure vegetation characteristics. When using the results of these biomass models as input in the storage capacity models, reasonable estimations of interception storage capacity were achieved with mean absolute errors between 17.7 and 40.8%, depending on the model. Extrapolating S-p to a reference area of one m(2) showed that L. angustifolia had the highest interception storage capacity due to its high biomass density, followed by P. alopecuroides, L. nitida and finally the grass mix. As a proof of concept, a mixed modelling approach was proposed to include species not covered in this research in the analysis. The findings in this research can be used to create a firm basis for calculations of intra- and interspecies interception storage capacities, essential for improving current urban hydrological models.

AB The different types of soil macropores (e.g., biopores and non-biopores) vary in the conductivity of water or air due to the difference in the 3D pore characteristics. The objectives of this study were to reveal which types of macropores and which macropore characteristics played the most important roles in regulating water or air flow. Intact soil columns sampled from the subsoil of a long-term fertilization experiment were scanned by medical X-ray computed tomography (CT), and subsequently, saturated hydraulic conductivity (K-s) and air permeability at -12 cm water potential (K-a12) were measured. The 3D characteristics of macropores were then analyzed with image analysis. The biopores and the percolating biopores that connected the top and the bottom of a soil column were separated for the biopore-dominated samples (with percolating biopores) and their 3D characteristics were also quantified. Our results showed that the mean macropore diameter of the limiting layer (MDLL) presented the best relationships with K(s )and K-a12 compared with the other macropore characteristics for all the samples. The biopores and percolating biopores contributed 27.8-74.5% and 3.26-64.4% of the volume of total macropores, respectively, for the biopore-dominated samples. The hydraulic radius, mean diameter, compactness, global and local connectivities, and MDLL of biopores, especially those of percolating biopores, were generally larger than those of total macropores. The global connectivity (Gamma) of biopores performed very well for estimating K(s )and K-a12. The MDLL of percolating biopores could predict K-s much better than the MDLL of biopores and total macropores. Moreover, the performance of MDLL for estimating K-a12 was as good as the MDLL of biopores but was much better than the MDLL of total macropores. The findings of this study reveal that the MDLL is a more useful parameter in estimating saturated hydraulic conductivity and air permeability at low water potential than the other CT-derived pore characteristics.

AB Climate change coupled with the current trend in rapid urbanization is increasing the risk of flooding that can cause loss of life and damage to property. Adapting to climate change impacts and flood mitigation has become a life critical factor as well as a severe challenge. Green infrastructure and low impact development methods are common approaches that are increasingly used to address stormwater management in developed environments. The analysis and results of this study show that AMC/IC does impact flood response even in urban developed catchments and that it can significantly impact flood responses during storm events. We show that considering AMC/ICs coupled with changes in seasonal rainfall patterns that are projected for warmer climates in the future can modulate some of the increases in flood risk due to climate change.
   The prevailing thought is that Antecedent Moisture Conditions (AMCs) have little to no relevance in urban hydrology, particularly in relation to climate change. However, current trends in use of stormwater management methods that depend on local storage and infiltration is increasingly making AMC or Initial Conditions (IC) a factor in urban flooding. Despite this trend there is little available literature that discuss the aspect of AMC/IC that can have an implication on urban flood management. Here, we move towards filling this gap in current literature related to impacts of AMCs in flooding of developed areas by focusing on how possible changes in seasonal rainfall patterns in a warming climate might impact AMC and starting conditions in stormwater Best Management Practices (SWBMPs), and how those changed initial conditions impact flood risk in developed areas. Using a comprehensive hydrologic/hydraulic model of an urban/developed catchment and continuous simulation, we demonstrate the importance of accurately accounting for initial conditions in flood assessments. We consider average summer temperatures based on approximately 70 years of historic data to select warm and cold years. We compare the model results between the warm and cold years as a proxy to look at trends related to a future warming climate.

AB Surface area is an important input parameter for reactive transport modelling and it changes with time when rocks dissolve. Here we show direct observations of increased surface area due to chalk (predominantly CaCO3) dissolution, using 3D in situ X-ray microtomography. This transient increase cannot be explained by changes in fluid accessibility or by surface roughening that arises from preferential leaching. We use model simulations to explain how this increase in surface area correlates with the size of the Damkohler space, defined macroscopically using a phenomenological dissolution rate law and the cumulative surface of the microstructure. We attribute this transient increase to the coupling between fluid flow and mineral dissolution and argue that the extent is determined by the advective penetration distance of the reactants. We conclude that using a macroscopic dimensionless number as a qualitative indicator for microstructure evolution has limited applicability.

AB Scale represents an important concept in all scientific disciplines, but the scaling effect related to non-point source (NPS) pollution simulation and sensitivity parameters has not yet been reported. In this study, the sliding window, the Fourier amplitude sensitivity test and the nested watershed idea were used with the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model to explore the temporal and spatial scaling effects of parameter sensitivity in a typical watershed of the Three Gorges Reservoir Region, China. The results indicated that a great scaling effect could be observed at varying spatio-temporal scales, while the scaling effect would be transferred and amplified from the hydrological modelling to the NPS simulation. Soil properties such as SOL_K and SOL_BD were identified as key parameters under smaller spatial and temporal scales, while channel-related parameters in terms of ALPHA_BF, CH_K and CH_N showed greater sensitivity at larger scales. Specifically, some parameters, such as CH N, USLE_K, USLE_P and ERORGP, were always identified as key sensitive parameters for the sediment and NPS-TP simulations, but some parameters, such as CH_K, showed sensitivity only above a specific spatial scale (778 km(2) in this study). These results could be used as a reference for studying the scaling effect of model parameter sensitivity and provide important information for model construction and the management of NPS pollution at different scales.

AB Accurate long-term estimates of precipitation at fine spatiotemporal resolution are vital for several applications ranging from hydrometeorology to climatology. The availability of a good network of rain gauges, and high precipitation variability associated with two annual monsoon systems and complex topography make India a suitable test-bed to assess the performance of any satellite-based precipitation product This study assesses the performance of latest versions of four multi-satellite precipitation products: (i) Climate Hazards Group InfraRed Precipitation with Station data (CHIRPS), (ii) Multi-Source Weighted-Ensemble Precipitation (MSWEP), (iii) SM2RAIN-Climate Change Initiative (SM2RAIN-CCI), and (iv) TRMM Multisatellite Precipitation Analysis (TMPA) across India using gauge-based observations for the period of 1998-2015 at monthly scale. These four multi-satellite precipitation products are essentially based on different algorithms and input data sets. Among these multi-satellite precipitation products, SM2RAIN-CCI is the only product that does not use rain gauge observations for bias adjustment. Results indicate that CHIRPS and TMPA are comparable to gauge-based precipitation estimates at all-India and sub-regional scales followed by MSWEP estimates. However, SM2RAIN-CCI largely underestimates precipitation across the country as compared to gauge-based observations. The systematic error component in SM2RAIN-CCI dominates as compared to random error component, which suggests the need of a suitable bias correction to SM2RAIN-CCI before integrating it in any application. The overall results indicate that CHIRPS data set could be used for long-term precipitation analyses with rather higher confidence.

AB In recent years, thermal infrared (TIR) cameras have improved in resolution and accuracy while their cost has declined. By deploying a ground-based TIR camera to collect time-lapse images, it is now possible to acquire high-resolution stream temperatures through both space and time. However, while ground-based TIR is useful for qualitatively identifying stream temperature differences, acquisition of absolute stream temperatures remains difficult due to interference from reflected radiation. Therefore, improved correction approaches are still needed to extract absolute stream temperatures from ground-based, time-lapse TIR imagery. Using > 1100 TIR images acquired every 10 minutes during two field seasons, we assess two methods for correcting time-lapse, ground-based TIR stream temperature data: (1) an analytical method derived from the literature that corrects for atmospheric transmissivity, reflected temperatures and water surface emissivity, which did not improve TIR temperature accuracy, and (2) an empirical approach that uses an offset correction created from in-stream control point temperatures, which reduced the mean absolute temperature difference between the TIR and insitu stream temperatures. Examination of the analytical method revealed its sensitivity to reflected temperatures from the surrounding environment, a problem that is particularly pronounced in ground-based TIR imagery due to the lower stream emissivity at more oblique viewing angles. Since reflected temperatures and stream surface emissivity can be difficult to quantify and are misrepresented in previous hydrologic literature, the empirical correction approach offers an alternative method for extracting absolute stream temperatures from ground-based TIR imagery affected by these factors.

AB Soil erosion accelerates the degradation of semiarid ecosystems. How to explain the erosion processes is increasingly attracting scientists' and practitioners' attention. In this study, we hypothesized the intensity and uncertainty of runoff and sediment events as the ecological function of soil erosion by using structural equation modeling (SEM), and integrated observed influencing factors to represent the ecological structure of soil erosion. We further assessed the interactions of ecological structures and functions in four typical patch covers containing bare patch (B type), Andropogon patch (G type), Artemisia coparia patch (H type) and Spiraea pubescens patch (J type) in the Loess Plateau over three rainy seasons. We found that (1) the highest and lowest probabilities of runoff (approaching to 0.37 and 0.22) and sediment (approaching to 0.27 and 0.03) events were in B and J types respectively. B type produced the highest runoff coefficients (0.004) and yielded 2-3 times more sediment than other three vegetation patch covers. (2) Antecedent soil moisture and crown width were two relative more crucial indicators to simultaneously affect the uncertainty and intensity of soil erosion in different patch cover patterns. (3) Soil saturated hydraulic conductivity connected the soil and plant latent variables to indicate the complexity of ecological structure. (4) The measurement error of sediment yield became the main source of system error of the soil erosion assessment by SEM. These results suggest that the uncertainty of runoff and sediment event was an important descriptor to improve the interpretation of ecological function of soil erosion. The logistic regression and SEM form a new analysis framework to explore the interaction between ecological structure and function of soil erosion. This framework could enhance the understanding of erosion processes, and be beneficial to managing the restoration vegetation and utilizing the available water and soil resources in semiarid environment.

   STATISTICS
AB Stream-bank erosion in the alluvial channel is a matter of great concern particularly for the irretrievable loss of fertile land. This in effect has direct impact on the agriculture, environment, economy and social issues at large. A series of laboratory experiments were carry out to study the turbulence structure over eroded bank topography. Modulation of mean, turbulent flow characteristics and the benefaction of turbulent bursting structures to the total Reynolds shear stress due to the changed geometry of the eroded bank wall are described for three different clay fraction variations. A side looking micro-acoustic Doppler velocimeter (ADV) was used to record the detailed high frequency velocity data near the bank wall to understand the coupled dynamics of flow and erosion on sediment-water interface. The information on clay and fine sand content of natural river bank was obtained from field observation. Results from the present study indicate that higher turbulence intensities and Reynolds shear stress have prominent role in the removal of bank materials from the bank wall and continues the dislodgement of material from the bank face until mass failure. Quadrant analysis to the random velocity fluctuation in the vicinity of eroded stream-bank shows that downstream bank material movement is strongly correlated to the presence of sweep events. Probability density function (PDF), kinetic energy fluxes and coefficients of skewness and kurtosis of velocity fluctuations show significant changes with the change in clay fraction of the bank material composition. Though the velocity spectral densities are in general observed to be similar for all the three different bank undercut depths for different clay fraction of bank; however, spectral energy shows signature of higher energy peak for lower clay fraction of the bank material.

AB The wind forcing effects on mixing dynamics and circulation can drive important bio-hydrodynamic interactions in certain regions of a hydraulically dominated river-lake floodplain system. Poyang Lake, connected with the Yangtze River, is an example of such a system. The wind forcing effects on Poyang Lake have not been assessed in detail. In this study, a hydrodynamic model and a current energy method were used to investigate the hydrodynamic pattern forced by the combination of hydraulic and wind drivers and to distinguish both forcings. Two prevailing wind directions (NNE and SSW) with 3 wind-speed (3 m/s, 5 m/s and 10 m/s) scenarios, including tracer transport and residence time, were further simulated to determine the wind effects. The results showed that there are distinct hydraulic-dominated and wind-dominated regions. In the three wind-dominated zones, various circulation patterns were determined by the wind direction and complex geometry, and current speeds were positively correlated with the wind speed magnitude, regardless of wind direction. However, residence times responded differently to wind forcings. The low-speed NNE wind forcing was found to be the most disadvantageous for mixing and dispersion and was prone to allowing material enrichment in the eastern sub-lakes. An improved understanding of ecological behaviour in local zones of Poyang Lake is provided to guide future water management.

AB Owing to hydrological change and human activities, increasing attention is being paid to the evolution of dependence structure of hydrological characteristics, especially for non-stationary multivariate frequency analysis. In this study, we performed a non-stationary frequency analysis of annual extreme rainfall of four study regions in eastern coastal China. Two indexes separately accounting for rainfall volume and intensity were derived from daily precipitation data recorded by four pairs of gauges. In particular, based on the compatibility of data sets examined by the copula equality test, index series sharing similar dependence structures were merged to enrich data bases for copula modelling. A moving time window of 30 years was applied to the index series for non-stationarity analysis. An investigation of dependence evolution was conducted by detecting trends and change-points in the correlation coefficient series. Time-dependent Archimedean copulas and Generalized Extreme Value (GEV) distribution were employed to model the joint and marginal distributions, respectively. Kendall's return period was employed to compute the design values of the indexes. Results showed an intensifying tendency of extreme rainfall volume and/or intensity in three of the study regions and uneven spatial and temporal distribution of precipitation. Finally, the occurrence risk of annual extreme rainfall corresponding to different joint return periods (JRPs) was analyzed based on the observed index series. The study highlights incorporating non-stationarity in multivariate hydrological analysis and merging compatible data sets to improve copula inference.

AB Changes in the patterns of regional economic and social development will affect regional agricultural and industrial structures, thereby affecting grain cultivation patterns. Imbalances between the grain supply and demand will trigger interregional grain flow. Grain is a water-intensive product, and virtual water embedded in grain products flows between regions, which will affect the utilization and distribution of regional water resources. This study evaluated the impacts of socio-economic factors on regional grain virtual water flows by using the partial least squares structural equation model (PLS-SEM). Results show that grain production centers in China are being transferred to the northern regions due to the evolution of economic patterns over the past 30 years. Driven by the imbalance between the regional grain supply and demand, the virtual water flow patterns of grain shows a tendency to flow from the northern and western provinces to the southern and eastern provinces. Results of structural equation modeling show that there is a significant causal structure between socio-economic factors and grain virtual water flows. The study indicates that the regional socio-economic pattern and its evolution will affect the grain virtual flow patterns. Consequently, virtual water flows will exert great pressure on water resources in the virtual water export areas, and the expansion of the virtual water export will increase the difficulty of regional water resources systems in supporting regional social and economic sustainable development and grain production, thus posing a potential challenge to China's water resources and grain security.

AB Extreme climate events such as severe droughts and floods have become more frequent and widespread in the 21st Century. Recent studies have revealed the tele-connections between Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO) and extreme precipitation over different regions such as South America, India and China. This study investigates the influence of MJO on global extreme dry and wet conditions, and how the strength of the relationship changes across the MJO phases over the globe. The Evaporative Stress Index (ESI) calculated from global GLEAM evapotranspiration dataset is used to represent extreme dry and wet conditions. Strong correlations between MJO and extreme dry and wet conditions are found, particularly over monsoon regions such as South Asia, South America and East Africa. The underlying mechanism of the influence of MJO on extreme dry and wet conditions is associated with the variation of precipitation, air temperature and soil moisture modulated by the MJO. The study suggests that MJO impacts on extreme dry and wet conditions should be taken into account in investigation of droughts/floods around the world particularly over monsoon areas.

AB Understanding the time that water takes to traverse the vadose zone is important to quantify groundwater recharge rates and to assess the vulnerability of aquifers to contamination. Tritium mass balance models provide measurement-driven estimates of soil water velocities, yet uncertainties embedded in these groundwater recharge estimates are rarely investigated. Here we analyze six > 15-m tritium profiles collected from thick unsaturated zones located on China's Loess Plateau and compare recharge rates obtained from various calculation approaches. Models used to estimate recharge based on unsaturated zone data include the tritium peak method and the tritium storage method; models used to estimate recharge using saturated zone data include the 'modern groundwater' method and a method that assumes groundwater is well-mixed in the aquifer. The tritium peak method presents reliable recharge; however, the recharge from the tritium storage method is two times of that from the tritium peak method. The well-mixed reservoir method overestimates groundwater renewal rates because the implicit assumption that groundwater is well-mixed in aquifers is not realistic. For potential recharge, considerable uncertainties arise from precipitation tritium reconstruction; while for actual recharge estimation, uncertainties come from the mismatched recharge mechanism between the model assumption and local characteristics. Selection of appropriate tritium mass balance models is of utmost importance for recharge estimation.

AB In this study we use polynomial chaos expansion (PCE) to perform uncertainty analysis for seawater intrusion (SWI) in fractured coastal aquifers (FCAs) which is simulated using the coupled discrete fracture network (DFN) and variable-density flow (VDF) models. The DFN-VDF model requires detailed discontinuous analysis of the fractures. In real field applications, these characteristics are usually uncertain which may have a major effect on the predictive capability of the model. Thus, we perform global sensitivity analysis (GSA) to provide a preliminary assessment on how these uncertainties can affect the model outputs. As our conceptual model, we consider fractured configurations of the Henry Problem which is widely used to understand SWI processes. A finite element DFN-VDF model is developed in the framework of COMSOL Multiphysics (R). We examine the uncertainty of several SWI metrics and salinity distribution due to the incomplete knowledge of fracture characteristics. PCE is used as a surrogate model to reduce the computational burden. A new sparse PCE technique is used to allow for high polynomial orders at low computational cost. The Sobol' indices (SIs) are used as sensitivity measures to identify the key variables driving the model outputs uncertainties. The proposed GSA methodology based on PCE and SIs is useful for identifying the source of uncertainties on the model outputs with an affordable computational cost and an acceptable accuracy. It shows that fracture hydraulic conductivity is the first source of uncertainty on the salinity distribution. The imperfect knowledge of fracture location and density affects mainly the toe position and the total flux of saltwater entering the aquifer. Marginal effects based on the PCE are used to understand the effects of fracture characteristics on SWI. The findings provide a technical support for monitoring, controlling and preventing SWI in FCAs.

AB The use of stable isotopes from precipitation as tracers in unconsolidated porous media can be limited due to attenuation in the unsaturated zone, yet this process has been poorly constrained in fractured rock. The complexities of fractured rock systems necessitate the use of multi-level monitoring wells for the measurement of isotopic tracers with depth. These methods, however, are rarely employed in groundwater flow and recharge studies, particularly involving temporal isotope measurements in multiple rock types. To understand the attenuation of isotopic snowmelt tracers in fractured rock and explore surface connections and recharge, an investigation was undertaken at three geologically-distinct field sites in south-eastern Ontario, Canada. Results of constant head injection tests at 2-m intervals were used to identify and isolate high transmissivity zones (2-3 in each well) for the construction of eight multi-level wells (22 intervals) used for groundwater sampling. Deuterium and oxygen-18 were measured in rain (n = 64), snow (n = 67), soil water (n = 118) and groundwater (n = 594) on a bi-weekly to monthly basis over two seasonal snowmelt cycles ( > 1.5 years). In combination with stable isotopes, measurements of hydraulic head, groundwater temperature, specific conductance and two rounds of tritium sampling contributed to the development of a conceptual model for snowmelt recharge and flow in sandstone, limestone and crystalline rock. Seasonal variation of delta H-2 and delta O-18 was observed in all rock types indicating recent recharge and strong surface connections. The dampening and residence time of the snowmelt tracer increased with depth in crystalline rock. Tracer attenuation was highest in higher-porosity sedimentary rock and strong confining conditions were observed to inhibit recent recharge. Substantial isotopic attenuation measured in the overburden indicated that the strong snowmelt signal measured in groundwater stemmed from water infiltrating through areas with thin or no overburden. Identification of the periodic trends and distinct isotopic horizons in this study would not have been possible without the use of multi-level wells.

AB Rationalized water use has become increasingly important in recent years, due to deficient rain distribution and increased water demands, such as in forestry and agricultural production. Evapotranspiration is an important variable of the hydrological cycle and one of the main components of the hydrological balance in the soil. The use of simplified equations is a potential alternative to estimate reference evapotranspiration (ET0) when meteorological data is limited. The objective of this study was to apply and test different methods to estimate reference evapotranspiration with limitations on meteorological data in the state of Espirito Santo, using the Hargreaves and Samani method under different meteorological conditions, adopting the Penman-Monteith FAO56 as a reference. ET0 was calibrated using the Hargreaves and Samani equation with different adjustments by linear regression, considering all the weather stations used in this study (general adjustment), different climate types (adjustment by climate), by dry and rainy season (dry and rainy season adjustments), thermal amplitude class (adjustment by class) and climate type combined with thermal amplitude class (adjustment by climate and class). ET0 was also estimated for the aims of comparison, using the Hargreaves and Samani original (HS) and Penman-Monteith with limitation of climatic data (PML). In increasing order of efficiency, quantified by the average absolute error (MAE, mm day(-1)), the methods to estimate evapotranspiration with limitation of meteorological data were: PML (1.46); original HS equation (0.68); general adjustment of ET(0)estimated by the HS equation (0.53) adjustment by thermal amplitude class (0.51); adjustment by climate type (0.51); adjustment for rainy or dry season (0.51); and adjustment by climate and class (0.49). The adjustment by climate and thermal amplitude class provided better ET0 estimates, especially on days with higher evaporative demand on air (greater evapotranspiration), when better evapotranspiration estimates for diverse applications were necessary.

AB This paper investigates the residual nutrient load from a combined sewer system along the shore of a deep Italian lake, to provide data that can help explaining the contribution of combined sewers to lakes eutrophication. To this purpose, a stochastic methodology is applied to the analysis of the combined sewer overflows and pollutants, that provides reliable estimates, with related uncertainties, of the storage capacity to be supplied in order to mitigate the impact on the quality of receiving waters. The sewer is modeled by SWMM and two terminal combined sewer weirs are modeled in detail and instrumented for calibration purposes. A year-long campaign was accomplished, allowing to study the occurrence and relevance of the first flush. The calibrated model of the sewer network was used to extrapolate the results to a 10-years period, thus providing a statistically reliable estimate of the residual load delivered from this watershed to the lake. A conservative evaluation shows that up to 22% of phosphorus and up to 41% of nitrogen delivered to the sewer are still discharged into the environment. However, the results also show that in this case a relatively small capture volume would obtain a target pollution reduction, thus providing insights on the feasibility of this structural practice in similar watersheds along the shore of endangered lakes.

AB Existent algorithms to train adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) such as gradient descent and least-square methods are useful, but they have problems such as trapping in local optimum as well as high-volume of computations. This paper examines the application of genetic algorithm (GA), ant colony optimization for the continuous domain (ACO(R)), particle swarm optimization (PSO) and differential evolution (DE) for improving the performance of ANFIS models in simulating monthly rainfall magnitudes. Monthly rainfall records of nine foothills to arid weather stations of Isfahan province, central Iran were used for evaluating the proposed methodology. The correlation coefficient and non-linear sensitivity analysis were performed on the available rainfall records. Monthly rainfall modelling was carried out based on three input groups and used separately in five applied models (e.g. ANFIS, ANFIS-PSO, ANFIS-ACO R , ANFIS-DE, and ANFIS-GA). The obtained results showed that proposed hybrid models had better accuracy than the simple ANFIS model in escaping local optima. The best model was ANFIS-ACO R (with R-2 = 0.92, RMSE = 2.73 mm and SI = 0.26), while sole ANFIS model (with R-2 = 0.33, RMSE = 9.98 mm and SI = 0.90) presented the worst output. Moreover, the obtained results showed that: (1) Coupling the optimization algorithms with ANFIS can improve its performance in modeling the monthly rainfall time series; (2) the correlation coefficient and sensitivity analysis of input data provided a valid input selection that could improve the model accuracy with neglecting the redundant input parameters.

AB Knowledge of the spatial distribution of water isotopes in the large river system is useful to comprehend the hydrological processes within the basin. Spatially limited water isotope data in the Ganga river basin (GRB), one of the largest river basins in the world, hinders the understanding of hydrological processes at the basin scale. Therefore to understand the hydrological processes, river water and ground water were collected from the source (Gangotri glacier) to sink (Bay of Bengal) of the river Ganga. The delta O-18 values of river water vary from -14.9%o to - 6.3%o with a general enrichment in O-18 from source to sink. The delta O-18 values of ground water are similar to river water only in the middle stretch of the river, indicating higher mixing of these two water sources in the middle stretch. Comparison of the monthly averaged (three years) delta O-18 values of river water and rain water suggests that temporal variability in the isotopic composition of river water is higher in the middle stretch of the river compared to lower stretch due to lower discharge in the middle stretch. To understand the spatial variability of delta O-18 values in the GRB, delta O-18 values of river water were modeled using latitude and elevation as primary predictors. The residuals of the model suggest that in the upper stretch snow/glacier melt control the delta O-18 values, in the lower stretch Himalayan tributaries control the isotopic composition of the river water and in the middle stretch evaporation dominates which is also supported by delta O-18-delta D plots of the different water inventories.

AB Hydrologists and hydrogeologists both study the flux and storage of water with the numerous interactions and feedback mechanisms of surface water and groundwater. Traditionally however, focus, models and scales of the studies differ. In this commentary, situations are illustrated where boundary conditions that each discipline assumes, preserves and actively uses, can and have to be overcome. These situations occur when the domain of one discipline cannot be separated from the other one because of existing interaction and feedback mechanisms at the boundaries. Highlighted are especially these boundary conditions, where closer collaboration between catchment hydrologists and hydrogeologists would be most useful. Often such collaborations would be relatively straight-forward and rather requiring an increased awareness than novel methods.

SO JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY

DE Irrigation; Return on investment; Rate of adoption
ID GROUNDWATER; DIFFUSION; ECONOMICS; FIELDS
AB The rate of adoption of efficient irrigation practices influences the return on investment from those practices and affects how much, and even whether, aquifer conservation occurs. A spatial-dynamic programming model for an agricultural landscape indicates that as the rate of adoption increases, the return on investment gradually decreases as groundwater levels rise in Eastern Arkansas, USA. The model results also show that slow adoption can increase aquifer depletion because there is a switch to irrigation intensive crops, but fast adoption can conserve the aquifer because a larger proportion of the crops use less irrigation water. Even the fastest adoption rate should not dissuade future adoption because the return on investment in the efficient irrigation practices remains high. At low adoption rates, a subsidy of efficient irrigation practices for the least irrigation intensive crop is almost as cost-effective for groundwater conservation as a tax on well pumping. At high adoption rates, only a tax on well pumping is very cost-effective.

AB Hydrogeological flow and transport strongly depend on the connectivity of subsurface properties. Uncertainty concerning the underlying geological setting, due to a lack of field data and prior knowledge, calls for an evaluation of alternative geological conceptual models. To reduce the computational costs associated with inversions (parameter estimation for a given conceptual model), it is beneficial to rank and discard unlikely conceptual models prior to inversion. Here, we demonstrate an approach based on a quantitative comparison of ground-penetrating radar (GPR) sections obtained from field data with corresponding simulation results arising from various geological scenarios. The comparison is based on three global distance measures related to wavelet decomposition, multiple-point histograms, and connectivity that capture geometrical characteristics of geophysical reflection images. Using field data from the Tagliamento braided river system, Italy, we demonstrate that seven out of nine considered geological scenarios can be discarded as they produce GPR sections that are incompatible with those observed in the field. The retained scenarios reproduce important features such as cross-stratified deposits and irregular property interfaces. The most convenient distance measure of those considered is the one based on wavelet-decomposition. Direct analysis of the distances is the most intuitive and fastest way to compare scenarios.

AB A first-order moment analysis is developed to investigate the temporal and spatial propagation of uncertainty of slope stability during rainfall, considering spatial variabilities in initial soil water pressure and soil hydraulic properties, and temporal variability of rainfall. Results of the analysis indicate that the uncertainties resulting from variabilities in initial soil pore water pressure distributions and rainfalls are comparable with that from the variability in soil hydraulic properties. Further, the evolution of slope stability uncertainty is driven by the mean flow field, and a localized large-uncertainty zone along the slope profile could form, leading to a localized low-reliability zone, which may lead to the failure of the slope. In particular, when the slope is close to saturation, the reliability of the stability analysis of any elevation of the slope is low even at early rainfall times. On the other hand, when the slope is unsaturated and heavy rainfalls occur, the low-reliability zone exists at shallow parts of the slope at early times. The results also show that greater unreliability exists at shallow depths at early times when the rainfall has a descending trend in comparison with uniform and increasing trend. Lastly, the low-reliability zone is always near the impermeable bedrock if rainfall persists.

AB ( )Proper soil hydraulic functions of the water retention curve (the WRC) and relative hydraulic conductivity (the RHC) are essential for studies of unsaturated groundwater flow in soils. Various mathematical expressions of these functions have been proposed, including the widely used van Genuchten-Mualem model combining the van Genuchten formula for the WRC and the Mualem formula for the RHC. Here we validate a model based on the van Genuchten function for the both WRC and RHC (termed the MVG model), against published experimental data covering a wide range of soil textures from sand to silt clay loam. The results show that the MVG model is more accurate and flexible than existing soil hydraulic functions, especially for predicting the RHC. The fitting of the model to the data also reveals a relationship of model parameters between the MVG-WRC and MVG-RHC functions. Both functions can be integrated and differentiated to attain simple analytical expressions for characteristic parameters of soil water flow, for example, the wetting front pressure psi(f) used in the Green and Ampt model for ponded infiltration analysis and the characteristic length L-c as a key factor in determining various flow processes (e.g., drainage or evaporation) in unsaturated soils.

AB There are different trend identification methodologies in the literature, but almost all are for monotonic trend searches within a given hydro-meteorological time series partially at equal epochs or holistically over the whole record duration. The most important question is how to identify within the same time series successive trends of different durations and slopes. For this purpose, successive arithmetic average methodology (SAM) is proposed in this paper, first for a set of trends visual inspection and then their quantitative duration and slope calculations. This method provides to identify peak and valley change-points years, trends durations and slopes. The most significant benefit from SAM is that there is no need for preliminary assumptions and trends identifications are straight forward. The only limitation of the method is short length time series. Absolute relative percentage error control is suggested as +/- 10% for separation of successive partial trend differences. The application of SAM methodology is presented for more than seventy-year duration total annual rainfall records from seven geographic and climate regions in Turkey. It has been calculated that both increasing and decreasing trend durations have at the maximum 4.5-year duration. According to the calculations, except at one meteorology station almost all the trend slopes are negative, which may be an initial signal for climate change impact indicating the rainfall decreases in recent years over Turkey.

AB Soil moisture is a core ecohydrological element in the middle-high latitude frozen area, which occupies approximately 30% of the global land area. The Sanjiang Plain, an important commercial grain production area, is the largest swampy low plain in a middle-high latitude frozen area in China. However, no published studies on this region have clarified the accuracy of soil moisture data from in-situ measurements; the performance of ecohydrological models are also unknown. In this study, we compared the ability of the SMAP product, a RSDTVGM model, and two self-erected soil moisture monitoring stations to capture soil moisture information in the Sanjiang Plain by using the Triple Collocation method. Soil moisture data were collected for 642 continuous days, and the data period was divided into three frozen periods (FT) and two non-frozen (NFT) periods. Valid data supply rates of the three methods were also calculated and compared. From the Triple Collocation method, the root mean square error (RMSE) of the SMAP, model and in-situ monitoring data sets were 0.03, 0.08, and 0.05. The valid data supply rates of the SMAP product in the FT and NFT periods were 27.1% and 57.5%, respectively. The Pearson correlation coefficient between the SMAP product and the in-situ monitoring dataset was 0.301 for the FT period and 0.557 for the NFT period. The RS-DTVGM model had a data supply rate of 100%. The Pearson correlation coefficient for this model was 0.101 for the FT period, but reached 0.726 for the NFT period. For the three soil moisture data sets, the accuracy ranking in this middle-high latitude area was SMAP > in-situ monitoring > model simulation. Although neither SMAP nor the RS-DTVGM model could capture the real soil moisture information for the FT period, both could accurately simulate the soil moisture in the NFT period. The results from the RS-DTVGM model demonstrated a closer relationship with in-situ soil moisture measurement data relative to the SMAP method. The in-situ method provided accurate soil moisture data, but its application is limited by high cost. In the future, the data from the three methods should be assimilated together to measure soil moisture data with high accuracy and high spatial and temporal resolution in this important area.

AB Climate change is likely to stimulate variations in phytoplankton composition and production in gradually eutrophicating water, with negative consequences for the water quality of many reservoirs. This study analyzed the effects of climate warming and increased nutrient loading on algae communities recorded by sedimentary pigments in the Changtan Reservoir of southeastern China from 1985 to 2015. Pigment profiles indicated that cyanobacteria, green algae, diatoms, and cryptophytes were the dominant algae groups during the study period. Algae biomass increased significantly after 2007, correlated (by the Mann-Kendall test) with an upswing in nutrient load and rising air temperatures. Generalized additive model (GAM) analysis demonstrated that total phosphorous was the dominant contributor to algae biomass during the study period, accounting for 41.37%, 43.86%, 58.91%, 97.36%, and 70.24% of variations in total algae, cyanobacteria, green algae, diatom, and cryptophyte biomass, respectively. The relative contributions of annual average air temperature to variations in total algae, cyanobacteria, green algae, diatom, and cryptophyte biomass were 10.80%, 14.02%, 14.13%, 24.64%, and 17.31%, respectively, depending strongly on nutrient load. In conclusion, climate warming and increasing anthropogenic nutrient loading forced phytoplankton dynamics and drove increasing algae biomass in this reservoir, suggesting that future water quality management practices should consider both meteorological and anthropogenic factors affecting algae communities.

AB Agricultural nonpoint source (ANPS) pollution has become a major reason for eutrophication in many regions of the world. However, it is still difficult to identify the relative contributions of different ANPSs to the nutrient export flux at the watershed outlet due to a lack of effective methods. The export coefficient approach (ECA) and the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT), which is a process-based watershed simulation model with aquatic nutrient retention simulation modules, were implemented to identify the ANPS and its associated quantitative contributions in the Three Gorges Reservoir Region, China. By using the SWAT-ECA framework, nutrient loadings to the river reaches in the subbasin and the export flux at the outlet of the watershed, which were derived from individual agricultural sources in each subbasin, were quantified accordingly. The primary goal of this study is to quantify the pollutant loads from different agricultural sources by using SWAT-ECA. The proposed work was conducted in the Xiangxi River Watershed of the Three Gorges Reservoir Region, Hubei Province, China. The total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) loads that were generated from the agricultural sources were 1299.1 t a(-1) and 97.4 t a(-1), respectively. Livestock production was the main source of the TN load, accounting for 82% of agricultural TN load. Livestock production and crop cultivation were the main sources of the TP load, accounting for 52% and 42%, respectively. The delivery ratios of N and P from the source areas to the watershed outlet were relatively high in the study watershed. TN (1234 t a(-1)) and TP (87.1 t a(-1)) from agricultural sources were ultimately released to the reservoir area, which accounted for 40.2% and 37.6%, respectively, of the total fluxes from the whole watershed. The comprehensive approach that is proposed in this study can be useful for identifying the contributions of individual agricultural sources to the nutrient export flux at the watershed outlet.

AB Water stable isotope signatures can provide valuable insights into the catchment internal runoff processes. However, the ability of the water isotope data to constrain the internal apportionments of runoff components in hydrological models for glacierized basins is not well understood. This study developed an approach to simultaneously model the water stable isotopic compositions and runoff processes in a glacierized basin in Central Asia. The fractionation and mixing processes of water stable isotopes in and from the various water sources were integrated into a glacio-hydrological model. The model parameters were calibrated on discharge, snow cover and glacier mass balance data, and additionally isotopic composition of streamflow. We investigated the value of water isotopic compositions for the calibration of model parameters, in comparison to calibration methods without using such measurements. Results indicate that: (1) The proposed isotope-hydrological integrated modeling approach was able to reproduce the isotopic composition of streamflow, and improved the model performance in the evaluation period; (2) Involving water isotopic composition for model calibration reduced the model parameter uncertainty, and helped to reduce the uncertainty in the quantification of runoff components; (3) The isotope-hydrological integrated modeling approach quantified the contributions of runoff components comparably to a three-component tracer-based end-member mixing analysis method for summer peak flows, and required less water tracer data. Our findings demonstrate the value of water isotopic compositions to improve the quantification of runoff components using hydrological models in glacierized basins.

AB Karst aquifers are dynamic hydrologic systems which can be sensitive to short-term recharge events (storms) and heterogeneous recharge characteristics (point recharge at sinks, irregular soil thicknesses). In this study, two adjacent karst springs, Tippery Spring and Near Tippery Spring, were monitored to better understand flow and source mixing characteristics in response to two storms in May and June 2017. Monitoring techniques included high-resolution discharge and temperature logging and collection of spring water using automatic samplers to analyze chemical parameters such as stable water isotopes and Mg/Ca ratios along with Ca/Zr ratios and rare earth elements (REEs) which have had limited testing in karst systems. The two springs exhibited behaviors which were both unique to each spring and shared depending on which parameter is considered. Spring-specific behaviors included discharge and isotopic response, with Tippery Spring having a flashier and faster conduit flow behavior relative to Near Tippery Spring's delayed storm response. Absolute Mg/Ca values were spring-specific, owing to the relative fraction of limestone and dolostone in their respective recharge areas, although both springs showed similar Mg/Ca ratio shifts after storms. While Ca/Zr ratios changed in timing and intensity with storm intensity, both springs exhibited a decline in Ca/Zr ratios as calcium-rich carbonate matrix water was displaced by zirconium-rich storm recharge water from sinking streams off the clastic upland ridges. Flushing of recharged storm water resulted in an increase in total REE concentrations at both springs (from < 0.15 ppb to > 1.0 ppb), with the timing and magnitude of concentration increases determined by the degree of surface connectivity intrinsic to each spring and the intensity of the recharge event. REEs and Ca/Zr ratios provided additional and complementary tracer techniques to better understand transient recharge and flow behaviors in karst springs.

AB Multiyear and multipurpose reservoirs generally need to adjust operational functions for different storage levels; most existing reservoir schemes lack the pertinence to model the complex behaviors of such reservoirs. This paper proposes an improved operation-based reservoir scheme to simulate the storage and outflow variations for multiyear and multipurpose reservoirs at a daily time step. In this improved reservoir scheme, the new parametric functions to represent the weights of the outflow through considering various operation purposes (e.g., hydropower generation, flood control, and water supply) are introduced. Then, the improved reservoir scheme is integrated into a macroscale hydrological model, i.e., Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) model. In this study, the performance of the proposed reservoir scheme is evaluated with the observed storage and outflow of a multiyear and multipurpose reservoir (Xinfengjiang Reservoir) in South China and compared to two other reservoir schemes (i.e., a multilinear regression reservoir scheme and an operation-based reservoir scheme). In addition, through uncertainty analysis, this study shows that the time-varying operation-based parameters can reflect the changes of reservoir storage but not reservoir outflow, indicating that the parameters for establishing functional relationships need further exploration. Results reveal that the proposed reservoir scheme has a wide applicability for reservoir storage and outflow simulation, especially for the reservoirs with limited reservoir management data.

AB In this research study, a fuzzy multi-objective optimization methodology is proposed for in-situ groundwater bioremediation utilizing the Graph Model for Conflict Resolution. In the current model, uncertainties in hydraulic conductivity and the ratio of transverse to longitudinal dispersivity of contaminants are considered using the Fuzzy Transformation Method (FTM). First, the BIOPLUME III simulation model is linked with a Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II) multi-objective optimization model to optimize a groundwater bioremediation system regarding conflicting viewpoints of decision makers. Then, the hydrogeological uncertainties of the groundwater bioremediation system are included in the proposed methodology using FTM. The three main objectives of the in-situ bioremediation optimization model are overall cost (well installation, treatment or pumping, and facility capital), the sum of contaminant concentration violating any standards, and contaminant plume fragmentation, which need to be minimized based on stakeholders' preferences. Subsequently, GMCR II is utilized to resolve any conflicts between the perspectives of the stakeholders to achieve a compromise solution. The performance assessment results represent the ability of the proposed methodology for optimal in-situ groundwater bioremediation. Results show that the minimum fuzzy interval is 323%, and pertains to the overall cost of the bioremediation system in fuzzy alpha-cut levels of 0 and 0.5. Conversely, the maximum fuzzy interval is related to contaminant plume fragmentation in fuzzy alpha-cut levels of 0 and 03, and was found to be 95.1%.

AB Soil degradation by water is a serious environmental problem worldwide, with specific climatic factors being the major causes. We investigated the relationships between synoptic atmospheric patterns (i.e. weather types, WI's) and runoff, erosion and sediment yield throughout the Mediterranean basin by analyzing a large database of natural rainfall events at 68 research sites in 9 countries. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was used to identify spatial relationships of the different WTs including three hydro-sedimentary variables: rainfall, runoff, and sediment yield (SY, used to refer to both soil erosion measured at plot scale and sediment yield registered at catchment scale). The results indicated 4 spatial classes of rainfall and runoff: (a) northern sites dependent on North (N) and North West (NW) flows; (b) eastern sites dependent on E and NE flows; (c) southern sites dependent on S and SE flows; and, finally, (d) western sites dependent on W and SW flows. Conversely, three spatial classes are identified for SY characterized by: (a) N and NE flows in northern sites (b) E flows in eastern sites, and (c) W and SW flows in western sites. Most of the rainfall, runoff and SY occurred during a small number of daily events, and just a few WTs accounted for large percentages of the total. Our results confirm that characterization by WT improves understanding of the general conditions under which runoff and SY occur, and provides useful information for understanding the spatial variability of runoff, and SY throughout the Mediterranean basin. The approach used here could be useful to aid of the design of regional water management and soil conservation measures.

AB Rainfall is considered the hardest weather variable to forecast, and its cause-effect relationships often cannot be expressed in simple or complex mathematical forms. This study introduces a novel hybrid model to month ahead forecasting monthly rainfall amounts which is motivated to be used in semi-arid basins. The new approach, called MPSA-MGGP, is based on integrating multi-period simulated annealing (MPSA) optimizer with multigene genetic programming (MGGP) symbolic regression so that the hybrid model reflects the periodic patterns in rainfall time series into a Pareto-optimal multigene forecasting equation. The model was trained and verified using observed rainfall at two meteorology stations located in north-west of Iran. The model accuracy was also cross-validated against two benchmarks: conventional genetic programming (GP) and MGGP. The results indicated that the proposed gene-annealing model provides slight to moderate decline in absolute error as well as noteworthy augment in Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient of efficiency. Promising efficiency together with parsimonious structure endorse the proposed model to be used for monthly rainfall forecasting in practice, particularly in semiarid regions.

AB This study presents a three-dimensional discrete fracture network-fault (3D DFN-fault) model that contains a 3D DFN and a deformable 3D fault. The fault slip-induced shear displacement and normal displacement are taken into account. Under a constant normal stiffness (CNS) boundary condition, the normal displacement gives rise to an increase in the normal stress and a decrease in the aperture of the fractures connected to the fault, which are then incorporated into the model. Finally, a numerical code is developed to simulate fluid flow through the 3D DFN-fault model during shearing and the effects of the aperture heterogeneity, shear displacement and fracture structure on the hydraulic properties of fractured rock masses are estimated. The results show that an obvious channeling flow in the fracture networks is observed as remarkable localizations of the flow paths within limited areas of fracture planes. The aperture heterogeneity of fractures tends to hinder the overall flow through the DFN-fault model during shearing. The equivalent permeability decreases at the beginning of shear because of the stress-induced closure of fractures. With increasing the shear displacement, the equivalent permeability of the model in direction perpendicular to the fault slip direction either increases or decreases, depending on the competition of two effects: (i) the permeability is enhanced by the shear-induced dilation of the fault and the newly generated flow paths by connecting the dead-ends of fractures that are intersected to the fault; (ii) the permeability decreases due to the closure of fractures, which is influenced by the increase in the dilation-dependent normal stress. However, as the shear displacement continuously increases, the equivalent permeability in the direction parallel to the fault slip direction steadily increases.

AB This study used carbon (C) isotope sourcing to determine transport processes of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) from the land surface to river catchments in Southwest China. Both nested karst watersheds investigated (Chenqi and Houzhai) are representative of typical karst landform environments (e.g., primary forest, secondary forest, and farmland). We measured DIC concentrations and the delta C-13 values of rainfall, river water, groundwater, soil, and plants. To do so, we used IsoSource (a Visual Basic program) to determine source partitioning over time (seasonal) and across the two nested watersheds. In 2017, the mean DIC concentration was 0.06 +/- 0.03 mmol L-1 and the rainfall delta C-13(DIC) value was -14.4 parts per thousand +/- 1.9 parts per thousand. We found similar DIC concentrations in the surface and groundwater of both watersheds, ranging from 0.20 to 0.71 mmol L-1 (seasonal) and from - 3.7 parts per thousand to - 9.4 parts per thousand (delta C-13(DIC)) in the Chenqi catchment and from 0.33 to 0.60 mmol L-1 (seasonal) and from -10.3 parts per thousand to - 6 parts per thousand (delta C-13(DIC)) in the Houzhai watershed. The average delta C-13 values of soil and local plants were - 24.6 +/- 1.4 parts per thousand and - 28.9 +/- 1.2 parts per thousand in the Chenqi catchment and -25.8 +/- 0.9 parts per thousand and - 27.2 +/- 1.8 parts per thousand in Houzhai watershed, respectively. In addition, carbonate bedrock and groundwater were the main sources of surface water in the Chenqi and Houzhai nested watersheds, both being greater than 30%. Source percentages were similar to 20% from atmospheric deposition and similar to 10% from soil. Furthermore, HCO3- was the predominant form of DIC (pH values > 8), and the contribution rates of dissolved carbonate minerals (HCO3-) were approximately 10.4% and 19.6% in the Chenqi catchment and the Houzhai watershed, respectively.

AB Dilution of sewage caused by extraneous water is believed to have a negative effect on the daily operation of the wastewater infrastructure. Ecological consequences arise due to an increased activity of combined sewer overflows (CSO) and to a decreasing efficiency of treatment processes, while the elevated pumping activity induces a proportional increase in operational cost. This work aims at putting these drawbacks into perspective by an in-depth investigation of several catchments for which detailed sewer and treatment plant models were set up to verify the effect of a virtual removal of the existing sewage dilution. Results showed that extraneous water is responsible for 5-35% higher CSO volume. Effects at the treatment plant seem less significant with small gains in treatment efficiency (2-4%). Energy savings (up to 5%) only marginally exceed the rise in sludge production cost assuming this extraneous water would be eliminated. Finally, a pragmatic approach towards strategies of removing dilution is suggested by the use of a decision tree.

AB Organic matter (OM) is widely accepted to be the trigger for arsenic (As) mobilization from sediments into groundwater. Identifications of reactivity and sources of organic matter responsible for driving As liberation remain unresolved. To address these issues, we provide the extensive characterization of OM in shallow groundwater, surface water, and sediments near a permanent wetland and a dried wetland in the Hetao basin with high As groundwater and low As groundwater, respectively, using fluorescence spectroscopy and parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC). Dissolved organic matter (DOM) of shallow groundwater and sediments near the permanent wetland had higher biological index (SIX), and more protein-like components and microbially-derived components relative to that near the dried wetland, showing higher bioreactivity. Fingerprint of water stable isotopes and higher water levels of wetland than shallow groundwater pointed to the recharge of wetland water into shallow groundwater. Laboratory incubations of the sediment with more bioreactive OM obtained near the permanent wetland mobilized more As. Both DOM properties and laboratory incubations indicate that OM with high bioreactivity promoted As mobility mainly by fuelling microbial respiration of Fe oxide reduction. Recharge of wetland water into shallow groundwater introduced bioreactive DOM into shallow aquifer. Groundwater DOM near the permanent wetland was typically sourced from both wetland DOM and sedimentary OM with high bioreactivity. However, sedimentary OM was the major source of groundwater DOM near the dried-wetland. It suggested that downward infiltration of surface-derived OM and perturbations of aquifer sediments by changing groundwater flow regimes increase bioreactivity of groundwater DOM and therefore enhance As mobility.

AB Eastern Arabian Peninsula represents the main natural groundwater discharge area of the Arabian platform fossil aquifer system. In such settings, connections between aquifers could strongly affect the flow dynamics, water quality and availability as well as karst formation and landscape evolution. Geological structures such as folds and faults are central to aquifer connectivity, yet their role on groundwater flow is poorly understood. Herein, we perform mapping of exposed and buried structural features in the Qatar Peninsula using Landsat, Sentinel-2 and ALOS-PaISAR scenes, correlated with field, GPR and isotopic data to assess their role in aquifer connections and groundwater dynamics. Our results suggest that ENE-WSW oriented fold-related faults act as vertical conduits along which artesian upward leakages from the deep Aruma aquifer take place into the shallower main aquifer unit (i.e. Umm er Radhuma and Rus) in southern Qatar Peninsula. On the other hand, downward leakage from the freshwater lens in the Dammam aquifer take place in northern Qatar Peninsula. The deep, brackish, and gaseous-rich waters ascending along faults in south Qatar Peninsula, in addition to degrading the water quality in the main aquifer unit, enhance dissolution of carbonates and evaporites leading to strong karstification that produces abundant collapse features. Our findings suggest that structure controls can add significant complexity to recharge mechanisms and groundwater dynamics in fossil aquifers. Future large-scale radar subsurface mapping will be essential to resolve the variability of the water heads in such areas and its correlation to structural discontinuities.

AB We consider the management of sloping, long and thin, coastal aquifers. We first develop a simple mathematical model, based on Darcy flow for porous media, which gives the water table height, and the flow velocity as a function of the underground seepage rate, the recharge rates and the extraction rates, neglecting sea water intrusion. We then validate the model with recent data from the Germasogeia aquifer which caters for most of the water demand in the area of Limassol, Cyprus. The data is provided over a three-year period by the Cyprus Water Development Department (WDD), the governmental department managing the aquifer. Three different models of the recharge sources have been considered and it was found that Gaussian sources give the closest agreement with data. Furthermore, based on our model, we subsequently develop an optimised recharge strategy and identify the optimal recharge rates for a desired extracted water volume while the water table height is maintained at the acceptable level. We study several scenarios of practical interest and we find that we can achieve considerable water savings, compared to the current empirical strategy followed by WDD. Additionally, we model the transport of pollutants in the aquifer in the case of accidental leakage, using an advection-diffusion equation and the concentration is determined in the aquifer for an ongoing contamination and two pulsed contaminations (pulse duration 1 day and 30 days, respectively). We find that in the case of an undetected and unhindered contamination (worst case scenario) the aquifer would get polluted in about three years. Also, we find that double recharge rates flush the pollutant out of the aquifer faster. Finally, to incorporate the possibility of sea water intrusion, which can render aquifers unusable, we develop a new, transient two-dimensional model of groundwater flow based on the Darcy-Brinkman equations, and determine the position of the water table and the seawater-freshwater interface for conditions of drought, moderate rainfall and flooding. The validation of the new seawater intrusion modelling approach has been carried out via comparison with a widely-accepted code.

AB Karstic aquifers are very sensitive and fragile to environmental changes. With more tunnels excavated in karst areas, groundwater levels are increasingly lowered and resulted in changed natural hydrogeological flow system and groundwater-dependent vegetation, soil and hydrology of surface water systems. Water, especially groundwater, is a limited and key factor and significant driving force for karst ecosystem processes. However, the effects of tunnels excavation on the ecosystems in karst areas remain largely unknown. This study aimed at investigating whether there were variations in soil water contents and shifts of plants water uptake patterns between rainy and dry seasons in a karst trough valley affected by tunnels excavation, and comparing their differences with those in a tunnel-free karst trough valley in southwest China. Monthly soil water contents at two soil layers of the upper 20 cm and lower 20-40 cm were measured, and soil water at two soil layers, subcutaneous water and plant (arbor and shrub) xylem water were sampled in February (mid dry season) and September (late rainy season) 2017, respectively, and the delta H-2 and delta O-18 of those waters were analyzed. The IsoSource model based on dual stable isotopes of delta H-2 and delta O-18 was used to estimate the contributions of different sources to the plant xylem water. Although the soil water contents at both valleys showed similar vertical and temporal variations resulted primarily from the evaporation and precipitation, the soil water contents of two soil layers in the tunneling affected valley were significantly lower than that of the tunnel-free valley at both seasons. Plants uptake water pattern changed from a dominant soil water source during the rainy season to a dominant subcutaneous water source during the dry season at both valleys. However, plants extracted more water from the subcutaneous zone in the tunneling affected karst trough valley than that of the tunnel-free karst trough valley at both seasons, of which the proportion of plants water uptake from the subcutaneous zone was 33% in rainy season and 76% in dry season, respectively, in the tunneling affected karst trough valley, while the proportion of plants water uptake from the subcutaneous zone was 24% in rainy season and 59% in dry season, respectively, in the tunnel-free karst trough valley. The above results indicated that tunnels excavation decreased the soil water contents and then changed plants water uptake patterns in karst areas.

AB Presence of vegetation in urban landscape influences soil temperature and soil moisture. Some studies in literature have focused on development of correlations between the above two parameters for agricultural fields and forest regions. These correlations could be dissimilar due to the differences in soil conditions (density and type), vegetation species and temperature between agricultural and urban landscape. This paper investigates the effects of vegetation on soil temperature and soil moisture by an integrated approach of field monitoring and numerical modelling. A simple hydrological model is developed to capture seasonal variations of surface soil temperature and its effect on root water uptake. Hypothesis of effects of soil temperature on root water uptake was investigated using field measurements of soil water content. Field site in urban landscape containing bare, grass and tree species were selected for investigation. There existed a contrasting trend in water content response between summer and autumn for both bare and vegetated soils. Due to higher evapotranspiration in summer, water content in vegetated soils were lower by up to 50%. However, water content in vegetated soil was found to be up to 70% higher than in a bare soil during autumn. It could be due to the lower soil temperature that inhibits root water uptake ability. This was verified using a series of numerical simulations that consider effects of soil temperature on root water uptake. Without considering soil temperature effects on root water uptake, there was an overestimation of reduction of soil water content by up to 50% in autumn period.

AB Aims: Tree sap flux density, as the basis for estimating forest transpiration, exhibits high spatiotemporal variation on hillslopes. This is largely due to the variation in the canopy leaf area index (LAI), potential evapotranspiration (PET), and volumetric soil moisture (VSM) that are induced by the slope position and shaded terrain effects. To improve the estimation of the daily sap flux density (J(s)) of sloped forests, a new approach is required that will extrapolate the J(s) measured at given slope position to other slope positions by considering both effects on the influencing factors.
   Method: This study was carried out on a southeast-facing hillslope of a Larix principis-rupprechtti plantation in NW China. The J(s) was monitored during the growing season of 2016 on three plots located at the foot-slope (FS), mid-slope (MS) and upper-slope (US). To exclude interferences from fluctuating weather conditions, only data from 16 sunny days were used. The dynamic optimal J(s) was applied to quantify the J(s) response to changes in the PET, LAI and VSM induced by the slope position and shaded terrain effects.
   Result: The mean daily J(s) (ml.cm(-2).min(-1)) of 16 sunny days differed among slope positions as MS (0.059) > FS (0.050) > US (0.041). The strong shaded terrain effect at FS was verified by the markedly delayed starting time of sap flow at the FS when compared to that at the US and MS under a weak shaded terrain effect. The strong shaded terrain effect at the FS induced a PET reduction which decreased with the rising DOY until the end of July and then increased, this effect at FS also induced an LAI reduction that varied with the DOY inversely to PET. The mean J(s) (ml.cm(-2).min(-1)) of 16 sunny days was reduced by 0.063 at US and 0.040 at MS mainly due to the slope position effect, and was reduced by 0.051 at the FS due to the joint impacts of a strong shaded terrain effect (0.0505) and a slope position effect (0.0005). When extrapolating the J(s) measured at the MS to estimate the J(s) at the US, the consideration of the slope position effect lowered the estimation error to 7.8% markedly decreased from 50.6% when not considering any effect. However, the J(s) estimation error at the FS increased from 25% to 87% when considering only the slope position effect, but decreased to 11.2% when considering both the shaded terrain effect and the slope position effect.
   Conclusion: The substantial spatiotemporal variation in J(s) exists on hillslopes due to the varying effects of the slope position and the shaded terrain. The rising slope position leads to a decrease of PET, LAI, VSM and consequently, J(s) while the strong shaded terrain effect at the lower slope (e.g., SF in this study) leads to a decrease in LAI, PET and J(s). Thus, it is necessary to consider the slope position and shaded terrain effects, as these variables can greatly improve the J(s) estimation accuracy when scaling up from measured values at one slope position to other slope positions and even the entire hillslope.

AB There is a need for the development of effective baselines against which the water quality impacts of industry in general, and shale gas extraction specifically, can be assessed. The salinity, and hence the specific conductance, of fluids associated with shale gas extraction is typically many times higher that of river water. The contrast between these two water types means that testing for salinity (specific conductance) could provide an ideal sentinel for detecting environmental impact of shale gas extraction. Here, Bayesian generalised linear modelling was used to predict specific conductance across English surface waters. The modelling used existing, spot-sampled data from 2005 to 2015 from 123 sites to assess whether this approach could predict variation for subsequent years or for a new site (data from 2002 to 2015). We show that the results were readily projected in to subsequent years for sites included in the initial analysis. The use of covariates (land-use, hydroclimatic and soil descriptors) did not prove useful in predicting specific conductance at further sites not previously included in the analysis. The extension of the approach to 6833 English river monitoring sites with 10 or more observations from more than one year over the period 2005-2015 showed that it was possible to reproduce the seasonal variation in river water specific conductance. The approach taken here shows that it is possible to use low-frequency but widespread monitoring data to predict natural variation at monitoring sites to give a probabilistic assessment of whether or not a pollution incident has occurred and the seasonal variation, expressed as uncertainty bounds around the observations, at a specific site has been exceeded.

AB This study unravels the controlling factors of concentration-discharge (C-Q) relations and solute export regimes of spring water based on long term monitoring of physicochemical parameters, radium and Rn-222. A simplified analytical solution is derived to quantify radium based mean transient time (MTT) based on radium disequilibrium. Key hydrogeological and lithological parameters such as retardation factor (R-f,R-Ra) and MTT of radium nuclides, and effective surface areas (S-e) of subsurface are therefore quantified based on the long term monitoring records and discussed with the C-Q relation and solute export regimes. The study leads to the findings: 1) The spring water is characterized by very short MTT (days to weeks). Lower MTT, higher effective surface areas and R-f,R-Ra are observed during the wet seasons than the dry seasons. 2) The slow mass transfer between immobile and mobile phases controls the solute exports of Cl-, Na+, K+, Ca2+, and Mg2+. Export regimes of theses solutes are negligibly influenced by dynamics of S-e and retardation processes. 3) Lower MIT, higher S-e and activation of NO3- and SO42- lead to higher concentrations of NO3- and SO42- in wet seasons, and vice versa in dry seasons. 4) SO42- export is additionally influenced by co-precipitation of sulphate precipitates. HCO3- is controlled by dynamics of CO2 dissolution caused by fluctuations of water temperature and water table. This study demonstrates that the disequilibrium of radium transport in the fractured aquifer can be deployed to investigate the metrics of the critical zone and the solute export regimes of a springshed.

AB The variations of DOC and DIC concentrations in lake ice and underlying waters were examined in 40 shallow lakes across the Songnen Plain, Northeast China. The lakes, frozen annually during winter, included freshwater and brackish systems (EC > 1000 mu S cm(-1) ; range: 171-12607 mu S cm(-1) in underlying water). Results showed that lake ice contained lower DOC (7.2 mg L-1) and DIC (6.7 mg L-1) concentration compared to the underlying waters (58.2 and 142.4 mg L-1, respectively). Large differences in DOC and DIC concentrations of underlying waters were also observed between freshwater (mean +/- SD: 22.3 +/- 11.5 mg L-1, 50.7 +/- 20.6 mg L-1) and brackish lakes (83.3 +/- 138.0 mg L-1, 247.0 +/- 410.5 mg L-1). A mass balance model was developed to describe the relative distribution of solutes and chemical attributes between ice and the underlying waters. Results showed that water depth and ice thickness were the key factors regulating the spatial distribution of solutes in the frozen lakes. Chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) absorption coefficient at 320 nm, a(CDOM)(320) and specific UV absorbance (SUVA(254)) were used to characterize CDOM composition and quality. Compared to the underlying waters, CDOM present in ice largely included low aromaticity organic substances, an outcome perhaps facilitated by ice formation and photo-degradation. In ice and underlying freshwaters, CDOM predominantly included organic C fractions of high aromaticity, while low aromaticity organic substances were observed for brackish lakes. Results of this study suggest that, if water salinity increases due to climate change and anthropogenic activities, significant changes can occur in the dissolved carbon and fate of CDOM in these shallow lakes.

AB The process of interrill erosion is complex by interaction of raindrop impact and sheet flow. Their relative contribution to interrill erosion is difficult to be evaluated even on bare soil. This study presents the new erosivity factor to evaluate the interrill erosion on steep vegetated hillslope with the more relevant understanding of the physical processes. The effective energy, the erosivity factor, is defined as the sum of the effective kinetic energy of rainfall and effective potential energy of surface runoff based on the energy balance. The effective kinetic energy of rainfall is determined by the horizontal component for slope of kinetic energy deducting energies dissipated by structure of vegetation canopies and a litter layer. The effective potential energy of surface runoff is equal to potential energy of the available surface water following rain-mass allocations of interception and infiltration. The data from experimental field plots with various vegetation coverage after wildfire were used to verify the effective energy equation. On densely vegetated slopes sediment yield depended greatly on effective kinetic energy of rainfall, while they from hillslopes having sparse coverage were dominated by effective potential energy of surface runoff. The dissipated energy due to interrill erosion showed the highest correlation coefficient with the effective energy under various cover conditions. The kinetic energy of raindrops was greatly reduced by the litter layer and the potential energy of rainwater decreased predominantly due to infiltration. The ratio of effective potential energy of surface runoff to total effective energy was the highest at 71.2% in the plots with low vegetation coverage. The energy efficiency for interrill erosion increased with decreasing vegetation coverage and reached maximum 1.35% in extreme rainfall event under low vegetation coverage. The constant and exponent of power-law functions between the effective energy and the soil erosion work were strongly correlated with gravel ratio and litter coverage, respectively. The results indicate that the effective energy is useful erosivity factor to evaluate the interrill erosion occurred by the complicated interaction of rain splash and sheet flow on vegetated hillslopes.

AB Storm water detention ponds are recognized as an effective type of treatment facility for urban storm water management purposes. This paper presents methodologies for the development of an analytical stochastic model describing the hydrologic operation of storm water quality control detention ponds with outflows controlled by orifices. The concept of effective storage capacity is proposed to properly represent a pond's storage in its stochastic water balance equation. The accuracy of the analytical stochastic model (ASM) is verified for many different hypothetical design cases. It is shown that the ASM for detention pond systems can provide accurate results for almost all possible design conditions. Implemented easily into a spreadsheet, the ASM provides an easy-to-use and computationally-efficient tool for analyzing the hydrologic performance of detention pond systems. The ASM can be used separately as a planning or design tool or together with continuous simulation models to help verify simulation results or reduce the number of simulation runs.

ID RIVER; SHALLOW
AB With the development and utilization of mountain rivers, modelers of rivers using one-dimensional (1D) hydraulic models face the challenge of selecting appropriate cross-section data for mountain rivers since previous studies have focused on alluvial rivers. Mountain rivers usually have larger bed slopes and smaller widths in comparison with alluvial rivers, which results in differences in their hydrologic processes. Our case study analyzes these differences using 1D models through the utilization of prismatic reaches with different gradient and width sizes and the provision of various boundary conditions. The influence of the size of these morphometric variables on the selection of optimal topographic data is related to the hydraulic problem at hand. In addition, mountain rivers tend to have more irregular cross sections and gradients than alluvial rivers because of their relatively erosion-resistant riverbeds. The effects of gradient deviation, width deviation and channel storage volume deviation on hydrologic process due to insufficient topographic data are compared. It is found that the influence of channel storage volume deviation, which is negligible in alluvial rivers, could be significant in mountain rivers. And the impact of width deviation is minimal in mountain rivers and alluvial rivers. Thus, in reservoir areas, measured width could be adjusted based on published stage-storage data to reduce channel storage volume deviation and improve flow simulation accuracy. This method is verified on a 605.71-km long reach in the Three Gorges Reservoir area.

AB In this paper, we study long-term coastal flood risk of Lingang New City, Shanghai, considering 100- and 1000-year coastal flood return periods, local seal-level rise projections, and long-term ground subsidence projections. TanDEM-X satellite data acquired in 2012 were used to generate a high-resolution topography map, and multi-sensor InSAR displacement time-series were used to obtain ground deformation rates between 2007 and 2017. Both data sets were then used to project ground deformation rates for the 2030s and 2050s. A 2-D flood inundation model (FloodMap-Inertial) was employed to predict coastal flood inundation for both scenarios. The results suggest that the sea-level rise, along with land subsidence, could result in minor but non-linear impacts on coastal inundation over time. The flood risk will primarily be determined by future exposure and vulnerability of population and property in the floodplain. Although the flood risk estimates show some uncertainties, particularly for long-term predictions, the methodology presented here could be applied to other coastal areas where sea level rise and land subsidence are evolving in the context of climate change and urbanization.

AB Freeze-thaw cycles are important processes relevant to terrestrial hydrological cycling. However, the representation of freeze-thaw cycles has been often simplified in large scale watershed models. The Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT), which has been widely used to understand and assess hydrologic budgets and water resources management, employs a simplified empirical approach to estimate soil temperature and determine the freezing and thawing status of soils. Here, we compared the performance of a physically-based soil temperature module and the built-in empirical approach in SWAT against field measurements at surface and 5, 10, 20, 50, and 100 cm depths at six stations of the U.S. Climate Reference Network (USCRN) within the Upper Mississippi River Basin (UMRB). In general, SWAT consistently underestimated winter soil temperatures and overestimated frozen days at all soil depths, while the modified version of SWAT (equipped with the physically-based soil temperature model; referred to as TSWAT) pronouncedly reduced the bias in estimated winter soil temperatures and frozen days compared with SWAT. Model performance assessment is conducted with three statistical coefficients, i.e., Bias (degrees C), the coefficient of determination (R-2), and Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient (NS). Statistical analyses show that TSWAT accurately simulated surface and soil temperatures at the five depths with R-2 and NS values greater than 0.82 at most sites, and Bias values were generally within the range of -1 to 1 degrees C during winter and ranged between - 2.09 and 2.58 degrees C in non-winter seasons. The differences in freeze-thaw cycle representation between SWAT and TSWAT translate into noticeable discrepancies in simulated key hydrologic variables, such as surface runoff, percolation, and baseflow. Compared against long-term observed streamflow (1980-2015), TSWAT outperformed SWAT in capturing variations in monthly streamflow in both winter and non-winter seasons. These results and analyses highlight the value of improving freeze-thaw cycle representation for enhanced hydrologic modeling in large watersheds that are subject to freeze-thaw cycles.

AB Experiments were carried out to investigate the effect of infiltration flux on air counterflow in a 2-dimensional (2-D) confined sand chamber. The air saturation distribution was monitored using light transmission and the air pressure was measured by manometers. As infiltration flux increased to 1000 mL/min and 1100 mL/min, significant increase in air pressure was observed. Due to the increase of air pressure, water infiltration was retarded, leading to a significant decrease in air outflow rate at high infiltration flux. When the infiltration flux was larger than 800 mL/min, the air flowed out of the sand chamber in the form of air "fingers". The underlying process of the finger-like air outflow pattern was analyzed quantitatively, and the critical infiltration flux leading to air "fingers" was estimated based on the relative air/water permeability of the working sand. The Green-Ampt model showed that the infiltration process was retarded by air counterflow when the air pressure head was comparable to the depth of the wetting front at high infiltration flux.

AB Exploring the effects of climate change on the hydrological response at the local scale requires climate data at high spatial and temporal resolutions. This is best achieved by generating downscaled ensembles of future climate variables derived from climate models. For this purpose we present a methodology to re-parameterize the AWE-GEN-2d model (Advanced WEather GENerator for a two-dimensional grid). The model simulates key meteorological variables needed by hydrological models and is particularly suitable to explore the effects of stochastic (natural) climatic uncertainty, which is fundamental for hydrological applications, especially at sub-kilometer and hourly scales. Factors of change for different climate statistics are calculated from climate model simulations of present and future climates and subsequently applied to the statistics derived from observations to re-parameterize AWE-GEN-2d. The model abilities in generating an ensemble of future climate variables for the transient period 2020-2089 is presented with examples of precipitation and near-surface air temperature fields from hourly to multi-annual scales for a small mountainous region in the Swiss Alps. The stochastic uncertainty is examined for present and future periods and for spatial scales from the RCM scale (12-km, daily) to 2-km demonstrating the potential use of AWE-GEN-2d outputs. At the RCM scale, model results yield a small increase in annual precipitation (4%) which is within the stochastic uncertainty range for present and future periods (7%). At the fine scale of 2-km, the increase in annual precipitation can exceed the stochastic uncertainty, but for less than 10% of the domain area. On the contrary, changes in annual near-surface air temperature exceed stochastic uncertainty both at the RCM and finer scales. Stochastic climate uncertainty was concluded to be very similar when comparing present and future periods and 12-km and 2-km scales. The benefits of using AWE-GEN-2d in hydrological climate change impact assessments are finally discussed.

AB The ecohydrological separation between soil water sources for plant water uptake and groundwater recharge has been recently examined in various climate zones primarily based on isotopic composition of water. The existence of the ecohydrological separation has profound implications for mechanistic ecohydrological modeling and water resource management. However, it is still unclear when and where the ecohydrological separation occurs, especially in humid regions. In this study, high frequency sampling of precipitation, bulk soil water, groundwater and twig xylem water for hydrogen and oxygen isotope composition measurement was conducted in a humid subtropical site in the central southern China from March 2017 to April 2018. We examined evidence of the ecohydrological separation with three methods (dual-isotope space, line-conditioned excess (lc-excess), and the piecewise isotope balance (PIB) method). The results show that the isotopic composition of plant xylem and bulk soil water are not distinguishable from those of precipitation water on the dual-isotope space due to a weak evaporation effect at the study site, indicating that there is no evidence of the ecohydrological separation. However, the other two methods support the ecohydrological separation in this humid area, with the results from the PIB method revealing more temporal details. The present study suggests that the ecohydrological separation can happen in subtropical humid climate. It is more likely to occur in spring and winter at the study site when plant-accessible water pool has been replenished by antecedent precipitation, while ecohydrological connection seems to occur during winter snowmelt. With the limitations of three methods, the caution should be taken when only one method is applied in examining the ecohydrological separation in such an environment.

AB Based on the principles underlying the calculation of the standardized precipitation index (SPI) and standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index (SPEI), this study selects precipitation, temperature, relative humidity, sunshine hours, wind speed and runoff data to develop a multi-scalar drought index, the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration runoff index (SPERI), using methods such as Penman-Monteith and Copula. This index is applied along with the SPI and SPEI to Yunnan Province of China. The results show that the changes in the SPERI are close to those in the SPI and SPEI. They are well correlated and can all reflect drought conditions. In addition, comparisons among these three drought indexes and the actual extreme drought during September 2009-August 2010 showed that the SPERI was superior to the SPI and SPEI and that the 3-month SPERI assessment was the most accurate. Therefore, the SPERI can be used to analyze, assess and forecast drought conditions in different areas as well as to assess the impacts of climate change on drought.

AB Water stress can cause the structural and physiological changes of plants to prevent excessive water loss according to species-specific water use strategies. CO2 and water vapor fluxes were measured by the eddy covariance in a mixed plantation during a 4-year period. The potential evapotranspiration (PET) was obtained by the Shuttleworth-Wallace model. Evapotranspiration (ET) versus PET was used to determine the plant water stress index (PWSI). The objective of this study is to quantify the effect of PWSI on net ecosystem productivity (NEP), gross primary productivity (GPP) and water use efficiency (WUE). The relationship between PWSI and soil water content in sunny and cloudy skies was examined. Mean seasonal PWSI values varied substantially among years. The average annual value of PWSI was 0.49 +/- 0.07. PWSI was strongly correlated with vapor pressure deficit, illustrating that the moisture limitation through high evaporative demand was more remarkable than water supply limitation. Water stress can substantially reduce canopy conductance and leaf area index, and hence decreasing photosynthesis. Water stress suppressed GPP while having little influence on ecosystem respiration, resulting in the increase of net carbon uptake. NEP decreased as a reaction to water stress when PWSI was more than 0.4, whereas WUE was enhanced under moderate and severe water stress (PWSI > 0.6). Compared to NEP, the difference of ET between cloudy and sunny sky conditions was more evident at the same PWSI value. Therefore, cloudy sky conditions were beneficial to enhancing WUE. Water stress restricted the mixed plantation in the period of spring-early summer. At the annual scale, the mixed plantation was exposed to moderate water stress. The PWSI approach is a promising tool quantifying water stress in forest ecosystems.

AB Accurate estimation of field-scale root-zone soil moisture (RZSM) is essential for hydro-meteorological and agricultural management. The cosmic-ray neutron probe (CRNP) is an innovative technique for field-scale soil moisture observation. However, it is limited at deeper depths, and requires suitable methods for scaling the CRNP effective depth to represent the root-zone layer (up to 100 cm depth). A merging framework was developed in this study for improving field-scale RZSM with the CRNP via coupling the representative ancillary RZSM information with cosmic-ray soil moisture. By using ancillary RZSM retrieved at the most time stable location, this approach alleviates the problems associated with lack of independent datasets, while maintaining scale representativeness. A linear autoregressive model was adopted to forecast the errors between two input datasets (the cosmic-ray soil moisture and ancillary RZSM) and a reference product, which was computed by spatially weighting the deepest in-situ soil moisture measurements apart from the most time stable location. The variances of estimated errors were then used to compute a suitable weight for each single product by following the original linear combination of forecasts, and subsequently merging the ancillary RZSM and cosmic-ray soil moisture. Performance of the merged RZSM in comparison to input datasets and exponential filter-based RZSM over three different environments was evaluated against the reference RZSM product. The results indicated that differences in vegetation coverages related to total aboveground and belowground biomass accumulation, root water uptake rate and canopy density are the major factors controlling the temporal variation in merged RZSM, and they can be partly interpreted via the framework procedure. Superior performance achieved by the merging framework demonstrated its robustness in improving field-scale RZSM measurement compared to other products. This study also underlines the strong relationship between input data quality and the performance of the selected merging method, with respect to variations of CRNP effective depths. Overall, the merging framework is simple to apply, enables unrestricted-use in different environments, and is flexible to combine further standalone data sources.

AB Submarine groundwater discharge (SGD) acts as major pathway to transport solute-laden terrestrial-sourced fresh groundwater, as well as re-circulated marine water to the global oceans. The study area, Bay of Bengal (BoB), a part of the Indian Ocean, receives one of world's highest terrestrial riverine fresh water discharge, sediment and solute flux from the adjacent Himalayan and cratonic South Asia. Thus, together with the monsoon-dominated tropical climate, it forms one of the most complicated, productive and interactive global hydrological systems. However, understanding such topical phenomena needs intricate mechanistic understanding, based on high resolution data, which are barely available from the BoB. Delineation of stable isotopic and chemical signature of hydrologic-sourced components in the SGD to the BoB would help to identify the intra-annual to diurnal-scale impact of seasonality and tidal cycles, as well as interactions with other surface water bodies. This study provides one of the first documentation of such high-resolution, temporally-variable, stable isotope patterns of SGD in coastal systems of the BoB, and possibly of any tropical ocean. During post-monsoon season, the discharging groundwater was observed to have depleted delta O-18 (ranges - 2.12 parts per thousand to - 4.19 parts per thousand) and low Cl- concentrations (745 to > 11,500 ppm) (seepage water), which is closely associated with the groundwater delta O-18 composition (-3.18 parts per thousand to -4.05 parts per thousand) and Cl- content (775 to > 5900 ppm) range. In pre-monsoon season depleted delta O-18 values suggests that regional groundwater contributes up to 45 m from high tide line (HTL) (up to 88%), and re-circulated seawater-sourced SGD dominates 45 m to 110 m (extent of study transect) offshore. In post-monsoon season, terrestrial-sourced groundwater predominates the SGD composition (up to 99%) till 110 m. Changes in delta O-18 and Cl- content, in pre-monsoon season indicates enhanced infiltration of seawater in the seepage face, due to lower terrestrial-sourced freshwater discharge, whereas, in post-monsoon terrestrial-sourced, resident freshwater dominates in the seepage face. The study suggests that SGD are sourced to interactions between local-regional hydrological systems, and do reflect their compositional variability. It also provides insight of influencing physico-chemical mechanisms, ranging from seasonal to daily-tidal time-scales. The outcome of this study thus may provide intricate insights in delineating the coastal hydrologic and biogeo-chemical processes, as well as detecting, carbon sinks, nutrient sources and primary productivity in a tropical ocean.

DE Water shortage mitigation; Proactive trigger development; System

ID SOIL-MOISTURE; FORECASTS
AB A complete water shortage mitigation plan which includes water shortage indicators and mitigation measures is essential in adaptive water resources management. Current water shortage triggers used to manage water supply shortages typically recognize only past and current hydrologic conditions and system states, e.g., reservoir storage or water levels. A systematic approach to evaluate the effectiveness of water shortage mitigation measures is often lacked. This study proposes a general framework based on daily simulation-optimization computation scheme to develop water shortage mitigation plan. It includes an innovative simulation-optimization based water shortage trigger framework incorporating both demand and supply side uncertainties to evaluate the state of a water supply system. Stochastically generated demand/supply ensembles were used to simulate system decision variables that were used jointly with past and current hydrologic conditions to prescribe water shortage stages. Each water shortage stage was tied to specific demand and supply side adaptive management actions. A mixed integer programming model optimizing source allocation from surface water harvesting, groundwater production and a desalination plant was then used to minimize operational costs and protect the environment while meeting regional demand. Cumulative mitigation actions were implemented as the system moves progressively to a severe water shortage stage. Retrospective analysis using observed flow and demand in the past decade (2005-2015) was used to vet the approach and demonstrate the advantage of forward looking water shortage trigger development scheme. A combination of mitigation measures is evaluated using stochastic flow and demand in the year 2030, revealing that increased magnitude of groundwater production under severe water shortage situations could be largely (50%) reduced, owing to proactive mitigation actions. The framework was applied to Tampa Bay Water and it has general applications to regional water resources management for utilities across US and beyond.

AB In sharp open-channel bends, there exists nonlinear interactions between streamwise and cross-stream velocities, which leads to the adjustment of flow energy transport, increases the energy dissipation and eventually influences the development of river bends. However, previous studies have not yet fully understood the mechanisms underlying the transport and dissipation of energy in open-channel bends. In addition, energy dissipation is directly related to the evolution of enstrophy Omega.Omega/2. However, it has not yet received much attention in the study of the resistance in meandering rivers. To gain an insight into these mechanisms, with the aid of detailed experimental data collected in a sharp open-channel bend, this study quantified the impacts of the key terms in the kinetic energy equation and the enstrophy equation. Results show that the term related to the transport of kinetic energy by cross-stream circulation is at least an order of magnitude larger than the other terms in the kinetic energy equation, which contributes significantly to the redistribution of kinetic energy over the cross section. The term related to the production of turbulent kinetic energy in the kinetic energy equation shows the smallest order of magnitude and thus is almost negligible for the time-averaged flow field. Furthermore, over most of the measured area, the term related to the centrifugal force shows values of at least an order of magnitude larger than the other terms in the enstrophy equation, which means that this term exerts the dominant influence on the energy dissipation. The results also revealed that the transformation process is insensitive to the variations in Froude number. These results are expected to improve the understanding of the complete process of energy transformation, especially the resistance caused by secondary flow in meandering rivers.

AB Deep soil water infiltration is a key hydrological process in seasonally frozen regions, and displays a distinct behavior from that in other unfrozen regions; however, the seasonal dynamics and key controls of deep soil water infiltration in the seasonally frozen region of the Qinghai-Tibet plateau (QTP) are still poorly understood. In this study, we examine the seasonal dynamics of deep soil water infiltration, and attempt to quantitatively assess the relative influences of several driving factors by applying a random forests statistical analysis. The following key results were obtained. Deep soil water infiltration shows marked seasonal variation. Rainfall intensity exerts little effect on the seasonal dynamics of deep soil water infiltration as almost all rainfall returns to the atmosphere via evapotranspiration. No infiltration occurred when the depth of lower layer frozen soil reached 29 cm, whereas deep infiltration increased during the thawing of soil frost, suggesting that deep infiltration is impeded by soil freezing. Overall, the observed seasonal dynamics of deep soil water infiltration and volumetric soil moisture content were similar during the freeze-thaw process. Furthermore, deep soil water infiltration was more strongly influenced by deep volumetric soil moisture than by shallower volumetric soil moisture. Our results suggest that the topsoil Mattic Epipedon, soil organic matter content, and root systems' role in vertical moisture movement should be taken into consideration when modeling hydrological processes in alpine meadows.

AB Arid and semi-arid regions experience large hydroclimatic variability and decadal-scale droughts. During droughts, the reduced water availability alters the biophysical properties of the catchments which leads to non-stationarity in rainfall-runoff (r-r) relationships. Uncertainty exists regarding the mechanisms causing r-r non-stationarity, especially at seasonal scales. This study analyses endogenous and exogenous catchment mechanisms which could possibly influence r-r relationships in two case study catchments in southeast Australia (SEA). The case study catchments are chosen such that they are representative of arid to semi-arid catchments that experience large climatic variability and decadal-scale droughts. The results demonstrate that endogenous catchment mechanisms (i.e. groundwater table, baseflow and vegetation) have stronger influences on non-stationarity in r-r relationships than exogenous catchment mechanisms like temperature and potential evapo-transpiration. These findings highlight the importance of understanding changes in r-r relationships in order to develop more realistic and reliable hydrological models that are needed to quantify and adapt to the impacts of changing catchment or hydroclimatic conditions. While this study is focussed on SEA the findings are relevant to all catchments that experience large climatic variability and decadal-scale droughts.

The procedure is at two levels: at Level 1, three Artificial Intelligence (AI) models are constructed, which comprise Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Sugeno Fuzzy Logic (SFL) and Multiple-Neuro-Fuzzy (Multi-NF) but their outputs are directed to BMA at the next level; at Level 2, BMA is used to combine ANN, SFL and Multi-NF for better predictions and with facilities for quantifying uncertainty. The model performance is tested using the data from Urmia aquifer in the West Azerbaijan province, northwest Iran, where due to the absence of participatory water usage management practices both Lake Urmia and its surrounding 12 aquifers (including the study area) are distressed. The modelling strategy and its results on Urmia aquifer provides an insight to the study area and will be used to investigate ways of arresting the decline in the water table of the aquifer but this should be feasible only by developing a series of management plans, including basin management plans, aquifer management plans, drought plans, water cycle studies. Under such an integrated management system, the model developed here is demonstrably well-placed to serve as an operational management tool for the aquifer.

AB The concept of return period and its estimation are pivotal in risk management for many geophysical applications. Return period is usually estimated by inferring a probability distribution from an observed series of the random process of interest and then applying the classical equation, i.e. the inverse of the exceedance probability. Traditionally, we form a statistical sample by selecting, from the "complete" time series (e.g. at the daily scale), those values that can reasonably be considered as realizations of independent extremes, e.g. annual maxima or peaks over a certain high threshold. Such a selection procedure entails that a large number of observations are discarded; this wastage of information could have important consequences in practical problems, where the reduction of the already small size of common hydrological records significantly affects the reliability of the estimates. Under such circumstances, it is crucial to exploit all the available information. To this end, we investigate the advantages of estimating the return period without any data decimation, by using the full dataset. The proposed procedure, denoted as Complete Time-series Analysis (CTA), exploits the property that the average interarrival time (i.e. return period) of potentially damaging events is not affected by the dependence structure of the underlying process, even for cyclo-stationary (e.g. seasonal) processes. For the sake of illustration, the CTA is compared to that based on annual maxima selection, through a simple non-parametric approach, discussing advantages and limitations of the method. Results suggest that the proposed CTA approach provides a more conservative return period estimation in an holistic implementation framework within a broader range of return period values than that pertaining to other methods, which means not only the largest extremes that are the focus of extreme value theory.

AB Agricultural drought is related to meteorological and hydrologic conditions and the resilience vegetation to water deficit that have negative impacts on agricultural production. In this study, an integrated drought condition index (IDCI) was developed by integrating precipitation, potential evapotranspiration, temperature, soil moisture, and vegetation conditions. The performance of IDCI in agricultural drought monitoring was evaluated by comparing with standing drought indices, such as sc-PDSI (self-calibrated Palmer Drought Severity Index), SMCI (Soil Moisture Condition Index), and SCYI (Scaled Crop Yields Index). Then, IDCI was used to characterize the spatiotemporal pattern of agricultural drought across Inner Mongolia, China. Results indicated that: (1) IDCI performed as well in drought monitoring as did sc-PDSI and SCYI. However, IDCI performed better than did SPEI3 (standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index at a time scale of 3 months), SMCI (Soil Moisture Condition Index) and VCI (Vegetation Condition Index) with respect to reliable and stable drought monitoring, detection of soil moisture and reflection of agricultural loss; (2) during the growing season (May-September), the frequency of droughts with higher than moderate drought intensity tended to be diminishing from May to August, and was amplifying again from August to September; (3) during 2000 to 2014, the drought severity was subject to regular variability with consecutive droughts during transitions between drought conditions; (4) compared to SMCI, VCI and SPEI3, IDCI is highly related to SCYI for maize with correlation coefficient of up to 0.788; the correlation coefficients between IDCI and SCYI for soybean and potato are larger than 0.5, while the SCYI for wheat is related to droughts with severe and even higher severity based on IDCI. The idea behind the development of IDCI can be referenced for drought monitoring in other regions of the globe.

AB The influence of long-term suspended sediment dynamics on stormwater pond performance should not be ignored, but is often neglected in pond design and performance evaluation. This paper provides systematic simulated quantification of long-term suspended sedimentological effects on stormwater pond performance. Integrated hydrological and two-dimensional hydro-morphodynamic modelling and simulations were carried over a 32-year period (1984-2015) covering 3896 rainfall events with a wide range of rainfall volumes, durations and intensities. Three event-based hypothetical rainfall scenarios: non-flood condition (5-year), sewer design condition (30-year), and river flood condition (100-year) rainfall events with 1-h duration, were also simulated for comparison between the traditional event-based approach and the novel approach presented in this study. Simulation results show that the flood peak attenuation and delay are more pronounced for small ( < 5-year) and medium ( < 30-year) flood events. The long-term continuous simulation results indicate that the pond provides positive annual trap efficiencies varying from 2% to 69% for 31 of 32 years, providing long-term water quality benefits downstream. However, an extreme rainfall event in year 2012 flush out the accumulated sedimentation as a shock load to the downstream river, leading to a negative trap efficiency of - 11%. The spatially averaged sediment deposition rate, as predicted by the model, varies with a mean (SD) of 2 (1.34) cm/year over the study period, which resulted in a 24% loss in the pond's volume over 32 years. The impact of the loss in storage on pond flood attenuation capacity are explored at regular time intervals over the study period. The results indicate that reduction in the pond's flood attenuation capacity is relatively more pronounced for medium (30-year) and extreme (100-year) flood events than the frequent small flood (5-year) events. The variation in annual sediment loading with rainfall quantities and patterns are also explored.

AB Potholes are an extraordinary abiotic micro geomorphic feature on the granite and quartzite topography of the Subarnarekha River basin. These erosional features are carved by the running water actions of River Subamarekha and its tributaries. The study has been conducted on 17 sites (n = 1707) which are exemplary for the development of this micro fluvial feature located on the rejuvenated middle part of Subarnarekha River basin. Hydrological and geological factors are imperative for their formation. Joint length, joint density, joint orientation, rock hardness, variations of fluvial hydraulic, bed roughness, river bed slope and hydraulic gradient are conducive factors for the development of this geomorphic feature. Monsoon is the ideal season for carving these features by river turbulence, when abrasive work of river is predominant on the river bed (monsoon = 3000-6500 kg. m(2)s(-3), non-monsoon = 0.50-3.0 kg. m(2)s(-3)). The evolutionary sequence of potholes is from round to oval and then elongated with vertical scouring. The relation between pothole radius and depth has been established to explain the process of its expansion. Joint length shows positive relation (R-2 = 0.71) with pothole area while joint density has a negative relation (R-2 = 0.29) as these are structurally weaker zones, characterised by destruction of these features. Suspended load is also a hindrance in their formation. Sites with high suspended load are delineated as pothole destructive zones. The mean dynamic evolution of circular, oval and elongated shaped potholes occurs at spatio-temporal level (Delta(o)e = 0.005 - 0.60 m(3), Delta(c)e = 0.01 - 0.25 m(3), Delta(e)e = 0.005-0.30 m(3)) and the initiation of this development depends on inner depth and radius of individual pothole.

   STREAMFLOW; RECHARGE; WATERSHEDS; SEPARATION; DISCHARGE
AB Groundwater recharge by precipitation is often assumed by practitioners as well as scientists to be a slow process of filtration through layers of uniform texture analogous to Darcy's law. In most basins, however, rainwater also finds its way through macropores and preferential pathways to the shallow unconfined aquifers within hours of falling. Recharge phases may extend over several days, increasing groundwater levels, stored volume and hence baseflows into adjoining rivers. In this study, groundwater recharge and storage are computed from baseflow as separated with a nonlinear reservoir algorithm from time series of daily flows at gauging stations in northern Germany. Results are compared to groundwater level fluctuation in the catchments and to daily seepage rates measured in a lysimeter station. Peak times of the fast transfer of rain water through the vadose zone are generally the same. However, while recharge from baseflow ends when baseflow assumes its typical recession, the attenuation of lysimeter seepage may last much longer. The volume of lysimeter seepage is generally higher than the recharge in catchments due not only to different vegetation but also to rim effects impeding direct runoff. Furthermore, the lysimeter walls allow vertical fluxes only. Without further evidence or improved devices, lysimeter seepage should therefore not be indicated as groundwater recharge for the site or catchment. Findings also indicate that the shape of derived recharge unit responses is practically time invariant but with a strong seasonal variation in the recharge-rainfall ratio of precipitation events.

AB Challenges in balancing freshwater demands and the long-term availability of freshwater from small island aquifers warrants responsive management, whereby groundwater conditions guide decisions about pumping rates to avoid well salinization. We evaluate responsive freshwater lens management for the first time, through transient, three-dimensional, dispersive modelling of Bonriki Island (Kiribati). Both responsive- and fixed-management scenarios are explored, including a novel pumping redistribution strategy. Modelling results reveal that responsive management offers superior lens protection, particularly during droughts. Pumping redistribution produced lower salinities but greater lens depletion. All scenarios indicate that the Bonriki lens will continue to decline, consistent with previous shorter-time-frame projections. Lower lens storage losses are attainable by abstracting groundwater at the maximum acceptable salinity, contrary to traditional strategies of seeking the lowest available salinities. The methodology developed in this research provides a blueprint for investigating responsive, "monitor-and-react" management scenarios, which we advocate as best practice for balancing freshwater demands with long-term lens security.

AB The interactions of hydrological variables in the terrestrial hydrological cycle are complex. To better predict the variables, distributed and physically based models are used as they account for the complexity of interactions. In this study, we addressed the joint simulation of water- and energy fluxes and the potential benefit of flux measurements in the parameter estimation process. For this purpose, we applied the hydrological model GEOtop to a prealpine catchment in southern Germany (River Rott, 55 km(2)) over two recent summer episodes, as a test case. Due to its complexity, the model is computationally demanding and only a limited number of forward runs can be afforded in inverse modelling and parameter estimation. We applied the gradient-based nonlinear Gauss-Marquardt-Levenberg (GML) parameter estimation method and linked the GEOtop model to the Parameter ESTimation tool (PEST). Using this developed GEOtop-PEST interface, we particularly investigated the value added by including turbulent flux data in the parameter estimation process, and analyse the impact of the additional flux data on the uncertainty bounds of the parameters. To better understand the interplay of the model parameters and to identify the dominating parameters in the calibration process, we also conducted a Principal Component Analysis (PCA). We were able to identify a set of model parameters that reproduced both observed streamflow and turbulent heat fluxes reasonably well. The majority of the estimated parameters were highly sensitive to the considered variables. We showed that the confidence bounds of estimated parameters are narrowed significantly when considering not only streamflow observations but also turbulent flux measurements in the calibration process. In this manner, correlations between estimated parameters could also be reduced.

AB Urban flooding occurs frequently in the world and urban hydrological models are widely applied in urban flood management and disaster mitigation. In this study, an enhanced inundation method (EIM) for urban flood hazard mapping at the large catchment scale is proposed. EIM can be easily coupled with urban hydrological models and the coupled framework can consider both source flooding and non-source flooding in floodwater generation. In EIM, the floodwater spreading order in the positive process is based on the topological relationship between depression outlets; the floodwater from lower depression elements is considered as a feedback process. These improvements make this proposed method suitable for inundation estimation in large urban catchments. Dahongmen (DHM) catchment in Beijing, China was selected as the case study area to illustrate the applicability of the proposed method. Historical inundation records during one heavy storm were applied to test the performance of the method. EIM is compared with USISM (urban storm-inundation simulation method) on the flood hazard map in the DHM catchment, which reveals the effectiveness of the improvements. The results show that all inundation locations are successfully identified by EIM and are distributed in flooding areas (water depth greater than 0.15 m) in the catchment. The average relative error of simulated inundation depths is 15%, which indicates that EIM can successfully simulate flooding scopes and depths in the study area. The results revealed that EIM can be a valuable tool for mapping urban flood hazards at the large catchment scale based on GIS techniques.

AB Complex hydrological processes affect valuable water resources in inland regions across arid central Asia. Historically, this was a critical part of the Silk Road, and it is now named the modern Silk Road Economic Belt. Using the Qilian Mountains and Hexi Corridor in China as a case-study of the inland region, we collected a total of 2311 water samples from the area and performed a comprehensive investigation of the water cycle. Results from stable isotope tracing indicate clear spatial patterns. In the upstream mountainous regions, glacier snow meltwater becomes groundwater at the periglacial belt. Supra-permafrost water develops into river runoff in the permafrost region. There are also frequent exchanges between groundwater and river runoff along the vegetation belt. In the middle/downstream region, river runoff becomes groundwater. Throughout these processes, both river runoff and groundwater are consumed by evapotranspiration, are recycled, and make a substantial contribution to precipitation. Overall, the upstream mountainous region is a critical part of the water resources. The cryosphere belt accounts for 44% of the mountainous region but contributes to about 80% of water resources. Recycling of moisture also plays an important role. During the summer months (May to September) moisture recycling accounted for 24% and 14% of precipitation in upstream and middle/downstream regions, respectively. The findings from the stable isotope tracing provide insights into hydrological processes and can help improve water management in inland regions of Central Asia.

ID SYSTEM; MODEL; TEMPERATURE; RAINFALL; SKILL; ENSO
AB Global climate models (GCMs) produce informative seasonal forecasts of global precipitation months ahead of the occurrence for hydrological forecasting. Meanwhile, the skill of GCM forecasts varies by location and initialization time. In this paper, we investigate the anomaly correlation, which indicates the correspondence between forecasts and observations, for 10 sets of global precipitation forecasts in the North American Multi-Model Ensemble (NMME) project. We propose to use principal component analysis to characterize the variation of anomaly correlation. We identify the existence of spatial and temporal patterns at the global scale. The spatial pattern reveals that high (low) anomaly correlation at one initialization time coincides with high (low) anomaly correlation at other initialization times. In other words, for a grid cell, the anomaly correlation at different initialization times tends to be similarly high, or low. It is observed that some of the regions where grid cells are with overall high anomaly correlation tend to exhibit tele-connections with global climate drivers. On the other hand, the temporal pattern suggests that the anomaly correlation tends to improve with initialization time. This pattern is attributable to data assimilation that bases forecasts at a later initialization time on more global observations and simulations. Generally, the two patterns are effective and explain 50% to 70% of the variation of anomaly correlation for the 10 sets of NMME forecasts. The projections of anomaly correlation vectors onto the two patterns help illustrate where and when the NMME precipitation forecasts are skillful.

AB The accurate determination of land surface water fluxes at various spatiotemporal scales remains a challenge in hydrological sciences. It is intuitive that land surface net water flux (i.e., infiltration minus evapotranspiration) directly affects near-surface soil moisture. However, there exists no hydrological model suitable to calculate net water flux based on measured near-surface soil moisture data. This is a consequence of the mathematical structure of existing models that use 'boundary conditions' to determine 'internal conditions', whereas what is needed is a model amenable to use near-surface soil moisture data (an internal condition) to determine the surface water flux (a boundary condition). To pursue the idea of utilizing remotely-sensed or in situ (i.e., sensor networks) near surface soil moisture data for estimation of net water flux, we derived an analytical model via inversion of Warrick's 1975 analytical solution to the linearized Richards' equation for arbitrary time-varying surface flux boundary conditions. The applicability of the new analytical solution was evaluated based on actual water flux observations as well as HYDRUS-1D simulations for four vastly different sites in Arizona, California, Idaho, and Indiana. Our results demonstrate that the proposed model reasonably captures net water flux variations in natural settings, including layered and vegetated soils, especially at larger time scales (e.g., monthly). While the model works for a wide range of climatic conditions, the prediction accuracy is somewhat lower for extreme dry or wet conditions. A major advantage of the new model is that it does not require calibration, which provides an unprecedented opportunity for large scale estimation of land surface net water flux using remotely sensed near-surface soil moisture observations.

AB Joint monitoring of the variations of glaciers and lakes within a basin is essential for an accurate understanding of region-wide climate change and the water cycle process. The central Kunlun-KekeXili region is an ideal experimental field due to the wide distribution of glaciers and lakes. In this study, we first investigated the glacier mass balance of 2000-2015/16 for seven major glacier clusters by utilizing high-resolution SPOT-6/7 stereo imagery and the SRTM DEM. The final results revealed an overall mass balance of - 0.16 +/- 0.05 m w.e./a. for the study region (with a total glacier area of 967 km(2)). Secondly, ICESat/GLAS altimetry data were used to quantify the water-level change of 2003-2008/09 for the two largest glacier-fed closed lakes (i.e., LexieWudan Lake and KekeXili Lake) in this region. Based on this, we applied a strategy which establishes the statistical relationship between the lake area change and the lake water-level change for 2003-2008/09 to estimate the specific water level using the corresponding lake area. We then further calculated the variation in lake water storage between 2000 and 2015. The results showed that the water storage of LexieWudan Lake and KekeXili Lake increased by 1.82 +/- 0.14 km(3) and 1.90 +/- 0.38 km(3), respectively. For each lake basin, meanwhile, the glaciers lost - 0.18 +/- 0.03 km(3) and - 0.21 +/- 0.04 km(3) of water, accounting for 9.9% and 11.1% of the increase in lake water storage for LexieWudan Lake and KekeXili Lake, respectively. Our results not only demonstrate that glacier meltwater has only a limited impact on the lake expansion in this region, but they also provide new evidence for the warming and wetting process of the climate in the northern part of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau.

AB The forecasted runoff is an important input data for the daily operation of hydropower station, and the forecast accuracy directly affects its operation efficiency. However, the forecasting error is inevitable, and it is influenced by the input, the structural parameters and many human factors, it is not only random, but also has great fuzziness. Therefore, it is very important to study the fuzziness of runoff forecasting error and reveal its fuzzy distribution law to guide the actual operation of hydropower station. In view of this, this paper has carried out research work in the following two aspects. At the theoretical level, in order to make the establishment of fuzzy set more objective and scientific, based on different theoretical fuzzy distribution functions and the parameter optimization method, an overall framework of fuzzy membership function optimization model is proposed by coupling the optimal closeness criterion, which can make full use of the guiding role of practical experience and at the same time effectively avoid the difficulty of subjective choice. At the practical level, in order to quantify the fuzzy characteristics of runoff forecasting error, a quantification method for runoff forecasting error in fuzzy environment is proposed based on the Hamming closeness, Cauchy distribution, Normal distribution and Cusp Gamma distribution. Taking the Jinxi hydropower station of Yalong River basin as the research object, the fuzzy membership functions of the fuzzy sets of runoff forecasting error under different flow intervals are calculated and optimized by the proposed method. The results show that the optimized Cusp r distribution can fit the actual data points better compared with Cauchy distribution and Normal distribution, and its average closeness can reach 0.979. So, the accurate mathematical expression of the fuzzy distribution law of runoff forecasting error under different flow intervals is well realized, which provides a good basis for the fuzzy risk analysis of hydropower station operation.

AB This study develops and evaluates a sensing system capable of measuring stemflow at high temporal resolutions. Leveraging affordable hobbyist grade electronics has allowed for the development of a system which is low-cost, easy to reproduce and adaptable. Eschewing classic stemflow measurement techniques, the system demonstrated herein utilizes a sensing payload which includes a wetness sensor and ultrasonic rangefinder. Combined, these sensors are capable of determining precise stemflow initiation and cessation times as well as capturing high temporal resolution stemflow volume measurements at 10 s intervals. A case study focusing on stemflow data collected by the sensing system from an isolated green ash (Fraxinus pennsylvanica Marshall) during a May 2016 rainfall event in Kamloops, British Columbia is used to evaluate the performance of the sensing system, demonstrating the accuracy of the collected data and the potential research questions that can be addressed by large scale deployment of the sensor system.

AB Permeable reactive barriers (PRBs) filled with zero-valent iron (ZVI) are a well-known remediation approach to treat groundwater plumes of chlorinated volatile organic compounds as well as other contaminants. In field implementations of ZVI-PRBs designed to treat these contaminants, nitrate consumption has been reported and has been attributed to direct abiotic nitrate reduction by ZVI or to denitrification by autochthonous microorganisms using the dissolved hydrogen produced from ZVI corrosion. Isotope tools have proven to be useful for monitoring the performance of nitrate remediation actions. In this study, we evaluate the use of isotope tools to assess the effect of ZVI-PRBs on the nitrate fate for the further optimization of full-scale applications. Laboratory batch experiments were performed using granular cast ZVI and synthetic nitrate solutions at pH 4-5.5 or nitrate-containing groundwater (pH = 7.0) from a field site where a ZVI-PRB was installed. The experimental results revealed nitrate attenuation and ammonium production for both types of experiments. In the field site, the chemical and isotopic data demonstrated the occurrence of ZVI-induced abiotic nitrate reduction and denitrification in wells located close to the ZVI-PRB. The isotopic characterization of the laboratory experiments allowed us to monitor the efficiency of the ZVI-PRB at removing nitrate. The results show the limited effect of the barrier (nitrate reduction of less than 15-20%), probably related to its non-optimal design. Isotope tools were therefore proven to be useful tools for determining the efficacy of nitrate removal by ZVI-PRBs at the field scale.

AB Surface water supply for a watershed relies on local water generated from precipitation and water connections with other watersheds. These connections are confined by topography and infrastructure, and respond diversely to stressors such as climate change, population growth, increasing energy and water demands. This study presents an integrative simulation and evaluation framework that incorporates the natural and anthropogenic water connections (i.e., stream flows, inter-basin water transfers, water withdrawals and return flows) among the 2099 8-digit Hydrologic Unit Code (HUC-8) watersheds across the conterminous United States. The framework is then applied to investigate the potential impacts of changes in climate and water use on regional water availability and water stress (the ratio of demand to supply). Our projections suggest that highly water-stressed areas may expand from 14% to 18% and the stressed population would increase from 19% to 24% by 2070-2099. Climate-change mitigation practices (e.g., energy structure reform, technology innovation) could largely offset these trends by reducing demand and enhancing supply, At the watershed scale, the spatially inhomogeneous responses to future changes suggest that regional water connectivity could significantly buffer the potential stress escalations due to the redistribution of water resources and diverse changes in consumptive uses and water supplies in different source areas. However, the detrimental future changes (e.g., depleting river discharges, larger demands of water withdrawal) may aggravate conflicts over water rights among regions and challenge our current water infrastructure system. This study provides new insights into the critical role of regional water connectivity in water supply security, and highlights the increasing need for integrated monitoring and management of water resources at various spatial levels in a changing world.

AB The Lancang River (LR) in China (the upper portion of the Mekong River which is among the world's most important transboundary rivers) originates on the Tibetan Plateau and provides important freshwater resources for living, agriculture, industry, and hydropower generation for millions of people downstream. The natural flow regime of the LR is critical to sustain native biodiversity and ecosystem integrity; however, it has been changing due to the combined effect of climate change and human activities. Accurate quantification of the impacts of climate change and human activities on changes in the flow regime is a prerequisite for water resources and hydropower exploitation and environmental protection. This study aims to evaluate climate- and human-induced impacts on the LR during 1980-2014. A distributed hydrological model CREST-snow combined with remote sensing and streamflow data and the Budyko framework were jointly used to address this scientific question during three time windows determined by the Mann-Kendall test and the history of dam construction. Results show that compared with the baseline period (1980-1986) when no dam was constructed, significant changes (similar to- 6%) in mean annual streamflow occurred during 1987-2014, particularly after 2008 when the construction of the largest hydropower plant (Nuozhadu) in the Mekong River basin began. Climatic change contributed similar to 57% to streamflow changes during the transition period (1987-2007), whereas human activities contributed similar to 95% during the post-impact period (2008-2014). At the seasonal scale, climatic variation plays a more significant role during the dry season (December-May), with precipitation the most important factor among climate variables, whereas human activities contributed more during the wet season (June-November), benefiting the downstream areas through mitigating floods. Among human activities, reservoir construction is a dominant factor affecting streamflow over agricultural, industrial, and domestic water uses. The findings of this study enhance our understanding of hydrological changes in the LR basin that may impact the Lower Mekong River, serve as a basis for water resources and hydropower exploitation and environmental protection, and highlight the need for considering reservoir operation strategies in streamflow projections in similar basins globally under climate change scenarios.

AB Spatially representative estimates of saturated hydraulic conductivity, K-s are needed for simulating catchment scale surface runoff and infiltration. Classical methods for measuring K-s are time-consuming so sampling campaigns need to be designed economically. Important insights can be obtained by experiments directed to understand the controls of K-s in an agricultural setting and identify the minimum number of samples required for estimating representative plot scale K-s. In this study, a total of 131 double-ring infiltrometer measurements were made on 12 plots in a small Austrian catchment. A statistical analysis of K, across the catchment suggests K-s to be only slightly influenced by physical and topographical soil characteristics while land use is the main control. The highest values of K-s were observed in arable fields, with a median of about 3 times and a coefficient of variation (CV) of about 75% of those in grassland areas. An uncertainty analysis aimed at determining the minimum number of K-s measurements necessary for estimating the geometric mean of K-s over a given area with a specified accuracy suggests that, beyond a specific and plot-size dependent number of measurements, the benefit of any extra measurement is small. The confidence interval of the geometric mean of K-s decreases with the number of measurements and increases with the size of the plot sampled. Applications of these findings for designing field campaigns are discussed.

AB Quantifying uncertainty in projecting climate change impact on flood frequency analysis is particularly relevant for long-term water resources planning and management. This study examines uncertainties arising from (1) a climate model, with and without accounting of intermodel similarities, (2) a hydrological model with two different error model definitions, which have previously received less attention in studies propagating uncertainty through climate change impacts on flood response. Through a Bayesian modeling framework, a proposed statistical framework is utilized to explore various definitions of sources of uncertainty and to develop a series of nested formulations that can evaluate the leverage of specific uncertainty sources in quantiles of future streamflow. To be specific, climate model similarity, hydrologic prediction error, and frequency analysis are formally modeled with an appropriate likelihood function. The quantiles inferred by each formulation are compared in a case study of the Yongdam Basin in Korea. Results indicate that variance in hydrologic response is underestimated if climate model similarities are ignored, and in many cases, the inferred quantiles of streamflow projection are biased accordingly. Furthermore, a simple error model used in defining hydrologic uncertainty may create incorrect information in determining the quantiles in streamflow projection. The approach presented here of quantifying uncertainty has the potential to better depict overall multi-source uncertainties in projections of climate change impacts on hydrologic response. Finally, our results also indicate that careful flood planning management may be required for the Yongdam Basin in future summers.

AB Forest stony soils have rock fragments and many macropores, the latter arising mainly from the activity of soil fauna and plant root decay. We still lack knowledge about the hydraulic properties of this type of soil, especially when considering the influence of both factors - rock fragments and macropores - on the saturated hydraulic conductivity. This research aims to supplement the method we proposed before to test the hydraulic conductivity of undisturbed soil samples (Ilek and Kucza, 2014; Kucza and Ilek, 2016). We propose to enhance the method by taking into account the impact of rock fragments and macropores on the hydraulic conductivity of forest stony soils, particularly on the hydraulic conductivity of the medium conducting water in the soil, that is, soil matrix. We studied, using artificial samples, how rock fragments influence hydraulic conductivity. To test the enhanced method, we used 33 undisturbed samples taken from the top layers (0-12 cm) of forest stony soils. The results show that rock fragments in the soil can both increase and decrease the infiltration of water by the soil matrix. Rock fragments with diameters close to 20 mm had the least influence on water infiltration. Soil macropores in the samples always increased water infiltration. Empty macropores increased it from two to twenty-four times while filled macropores from three to five times. Our method gives the opportunity to study the hydraulic conductivity of macropores and their physical and chemical properties.

AB Information on vertical Soil Moisture Content (SMC) profile is important for several hydro-meteorological processes. This study borrows the idea of coupling the memory and forcing from a previous study and develops a spatially-varying Statistical Soil Moisture Profile (SSMP) model to estimate the vertical SMC profile. It uses only surface soil moisture (0-5 cm) values and Hydrological Soil Groups (HSGs) information of the location. The focus of the study is incorporation of the HSG information to ensure the spatial transferability of the proposed model by capturing the spatial variations of soil moisture profile with the change in soil hydraulic properties. The wide range of soil moisture data for model development as well as for spatial validation is obtained from 171 stations from different networks of International Soil Moisture Network (ISMN) at five different depths, i.e., 5, 10, 20, 51 and 102 cm. The HSG information at the locations are extracted from the Web Soil Survey (WSS) database. The potential of spatial transferability of the SSMP model is assessed by applying it to the new stations within the corresponding HSG. Model performances are promising for all four depth pairs (5-10, 10-20, 20-51 and 51-102 cm) of all four HSGs during both model development and spatial validation given the model complexity. Hence, the spatially-varying SSMP model is suitable at the ungauged locations by incorporating the HSG information. The potential application of the proposed model shows the future scope to assimilate the satellite based surface SMC data into the model to develop a vertical soil moisture profile map over a large area.

AB Hydrological and sediment transport characteristics for the Kosi basin, which covers parts of Nepal and India, were analysed to understand the spatiotemporal variability of the hydrology and sediment dynamics of the Kosi basin and its implications for flood hazard and sediment dynamics. The study revealed that similar to 56% of the discharge at Chatara (where all major tributaries of the Kosi meet) is contributed from the western part of the basin even though this constitutes only 34% of the total basin area. In contrast, the central and eastern parts of the basin constitute 57% and 8% of the basin area but contribute similar to 38% and similar to 16% of the discharge at Chatara, respectively. The contribution of sediment load at Chatara from the different tributaries of the Kosi River also shows a similar pattern. Of a total of similar to 100 million tonnes of the annual sediment load at Chatara, similar to 56% is transported from four tributaries: the Indrawati, Bhote Kosi, Tama Kosi (all draining from the west), and Tamor. The remaining similar to 44% is transported by other tributaries upstream of Chatara, the most important being the Arun, Dudh Kosi, and Sun Kosi. Sediment budgeting in this study, based on annual sediment load data, suggested that similar to 20 million tonnes of sediments are deposited between Chatara and Birpur annually. This study also found that similar to 53 million tonnes of sediments are being accommodated between Birpur and Baltara annually. Sediment dynamics in the Kosi basin emerges as the most important river management issue, and this is closely linked to channel instability and frequent flooding in the alluvial plains.

AB Expert systems adopted in real-time multi-scale runoff prediction are useful decision-making tools for hydrologists but the stochastic nature of any hydrological variable can pose significant challenges in attaining a reliable predictive model. This paper advocates a data-driven approach used to design two-phase hybrid model (i.e., CVEE-ELM). The model utilizes complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition with adaptive noise (CEEMDAN) coupled with the variational mode decomposition (VMD) algorithms for better frequency resolution of the input datasets and the extreme learning machine (ELM) algorithm as the objective predictive model. In the first stage of the presented model design, notable frequencies in the predictor-target data series are uncovered, utilizing the CEEMDAN algorithm where the model's inputs are decomposed into their respective Intrinsic Mode Functions (IMFs) and the Residual (Res) series. The second stage entails a VMD approach, used to decompose the yet-unresolved high frequencies (i.e., IMF1 ) into their variational modes, further discerning and establishing the data attributes to be incorporated into the ELM model to simulate the respective IMFs, Res and VM data series, aggregated as an integrative tool for multiscale runoff prediction. In the model evaluative phase, the hybrid CVEE-ELM is cross-validated with a single-phase hybrid ELM and an autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model to benchmark its accuracy for predicting 1-, 3- and 6-month ahead runoff in Yingluoxia watershed, Northwestern China. Two-phase hybrid model exhibits superior accuracy at all lead times, to accord with high degree of correlations between the observed and the forecasted runoff, a relatively large Nash-Sutcliffe and the Legate-McCabe Index. Taylor diagrams depict the two-phase hybrid CVEE-ELM model generated forecasts located close to a reference (i.e., a perfect) model, with a lower root-mean square centered difference, and a correspondingly large correlation for all forecast horizons, although the model's accuracy for shorter lead times (1-month), as expected, are better than the 3- and 6-month horizon. The study shows that the two-phase hybrid CVEE-ELM model where an integration of two frequency resolution algorithms are made, is a preferred data-driven tool that can be explored for real-life decision-system design, particularly for hydrological forecasting problems that have significantly stochastic data features, and thus, will require reliable forecasts to be generated at multi-step horizons.

AB Stable isotopes have been used to quantify lake and wetland pond water loss to evaporation by applying the modified Craig and Gordon (1965) model. This model and its derivatives employ simplifying assumptions that ignore the additions of precipitation and infiltration outputs and assume evaporation is the only loss term over the prediction period. Here we develop a coupled water and isotope mass-balance model to account for precipitation additions. Our model uses physical and isotopic observations to quantify pond evaporation and infiltration losses over the ice-free period. We tested and applied the model to four wetland ponds at the St Denis National Wildlife Research Area, Saskatchewan Canada, where we have long-term datasets. Modeled infiltration rates from the ponds ranged between 0.99 and 9.2 mm/d and open water evaporation rates ranged between 0.88 and 2.8 mm/d. Both were consistent with independent estimates. Infiltration amounts were highest in the ephemeral ponds (that dry out within days or weeks of the spring melt period). In these ponds, infiltration exceeded evaporation. In permanent ponds, that is ponds that do not dry out; evaporation exceeded infiltration. Evaporation amounts were most substantial for permanent ponds that were not sheltered by topography or riparian vegetation. Overall, our coupled water and isotope mass-balance model combined with physical and isotope observations was able to quantify the spatially and temporally variable evaporation and infiltration fluxes within and between ponds.

AB The Luanhe River basin, the mostly afforested river basin in North China, has exhibited significant land use/land cover change (LUCC) under climate change that could jointly affect water availability of the basin in the future. This study examines both impacts of LUCC and climate change on runoff over the upper reaches of the Luanhe River basin. First, the land use in 2020 is predicted based on the Cellular Automata-Markov (CA-Markov). Second, a hydrological model (Soil Water Assessment Tools, SWAT) is set up for the baseline period 1961-1979 and driven primarily by outputs from five general circulation models (GCMs) under four representative concentration pathways (RCPs) (i.e., RCP2.6, RCP4.5, RCP6.0 and RCP8.5) for the period 2020-2030. Results show that the ensemble mean annual precipitation may increase under four RCPs for the period 2020-2030, with the maximum (470 mm/yr) and minimum (444 mm/yr) for RCP8.5 and RCP6.0, respectively, 1-7% higher than the observed mean annual precipitation (441 mm/yr) during 1961-1979. The relationship between the runoff simulations and the RCPs under the 2020 land use scenario is nonlinear, with the maximum (57 mm/yr) and minimum (50 mm/yr) mean annual runoff depths under the RCP4.5 and RCP6.0 scenarios, respectively, similar to 58% and similar to 39% higher than the mean annual observed runoff depth (36 mm/yr) for the baseline period. The increase in forestland (similar to 56%) and decrease in agriculture land (similar to -30%) are remarkable for the period 1970-2020, driven primarily by afforestation implemented in the Luanhe River basin. LUCC would lead to a slight decrease in mean annual runoff, and the runoff only increases in summer but decreases in other three seasons. The decrease in surface runoff and groundwater discharge jointly results in the overall decrease in runoff due to LUCC. In general, the climate change impact will dominate runoff change for the study basin, though marked afforestation has taken place and is likely to continue in the future.

AB This work investigates regionalization techniques for large-scale model applications in the frame of a pan-European assessment of water resources covering approx. 740,000 km(2) in Western Europe. Using the SWAT platform, four variants of the similarity based regionalization approach were compared. The first two involved unsupervised clustering to define hydrological regions before performing hydrological model calibration, whereas the last two involved supervised clustering after performing calibration. Similarity is defined using Partial Least Squares Regression (PLSR) analysis that identifies watershed physiographic characteristics that are most relevant for the selected hydrological response indices.
   The PLSR results indicate that typically available watershed characteristics such as geomorphology, land-use, climate, and soil properties describe reasonably well the average hydrological conditions but poorly the extreme events. Regionalization variants considering unsupervised clustering and supervised clustering performed similarly well when using all available information. However, results indicate that supervised clustering uses data more efficiently and may be more suitable when data are scarce. It is demonstrated that parsimonious use of available data can be achieved using both regionalization techniques. Finally, model performance consistently becomes acceptable by calibrating watersheds covering only 10% of the model domain, thus, making the calibration task affordable in terms of time and computational resources required.

AB Accurate forecasting of lake level time series (LLTS) is an important but challenging problem with major economic, social and environmental implications. However, in recent years, the level of uncertainty in the existing LLTS forecast methods has increased significantly due to climate change, therefore, the need to develop more accurate models. The main research question for this study is whether it is necessary to use nonlinear methods in LLTS modeling or if linear methods can produce as accurate and reliable forecast tools. We introduce a new linear-based forecast method for LLTS using spectral analysis, seasonal standardization, and stochastic terms. The application of the new LLTS forecast method is tested on two case study Lakes, including the Van Lake, in Turkey and the Michigan-Huron Lake, in North America. A two-step preprocessing techniques based on standardization and differencing was used for the Van Lake, and spectral analysis and differencing was employed for the Michigan-Huron Lake. We then compared the accuracy and uncertainty of the proposed linear method with an artificial neural network (ANN) and adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) methods. The uncertainty of the new linear LLTS forecast model was +/- 0.00455 and +/- 0.00264 for the Van Lake and the Michigan-Huron Lake, respectively, compared to +/- 0.00625 and +/- 0.00766 for the ANN and the ANFIS (respectively) at the Van Lake and +/- 0.00312 and +/- 0.00319 for the ANN and the ANFIS (respectively) at the Michigan-Huron Lake.

AB The hierarchy of one-dimensional equations and numerical methods describing the motion of floods and disturbances in streams is studied, critically reviewed, and a number of results obtained. Initially the long wave equations are considered. When presented in terms of discharge and cross-sectional area they enable the development of simple fully-nonlinear advection-diffusion models whose only approximation is that disturbances be very long, easily satisfied in most flood routing problems. Then, making the approximation that changes in surface slope are relatively small such that diffusion terms in the equations are small, various advection-diffusion and Muskingum models are derived. Several well-known Muskingum formulations are tested; one is found to be in error. The three families of governing equations, the long wave equations, and the advection-diffusion and the Muskingum approximations, are linearised and analytical solutions obtained. A dimensionless diffusion-frequency number measures the accuracies of the approximate methods. Criteria for practical use are given, which reveal when they have difficulties, for streams of small slope, for fast-rising floods, and/or when shorter period waves are present in an inflow hydrograph. They can probably be used in most flood routing problems with an idealised smooth inflow. However the fact that they cannot be used for all problems requires a general alternative flood routing method, for which it is recommended to use the long wave equations themselves written in terms of discharge and cross-sectional area, when a surprisingly simple physical stream model can be used. An explicit finite difference numerical method is presented that can be used with different inflow specifications and downstream boundary conditions, and is recommended for general use.

AB Among the reference evapotranspiration (ETo) equations, temperature-based and radiation-based equations have been accepted as promising approaches when the available meteorological data are limited. The present paper aimed at assessing this general implication in island environments, which might be generally volatile than the interior/coastal zones. Using data from five island locations of Iran, daily ETo values were calculated by the benchmark FAO-Penman-Monteith (FAO56-PM) model, then the commonly used temperature-, radiation- and mass transfer-based ETo equations were evaluated against the benchmark values. An additional heuristic modeling of ETo was also performed through employing gene expressions programming (GEP), evaluated by k-fold testing. The obtained outcomes showed that the calibrated mass transfer-based equations and their corresponded GEP models generally surpassed the other applied models in the studied locations. This criticized the commonly accepted implication about applying temperature/radiation-based models in case of data scarcity for different locations. Nevertheless, analysis of the temporal variations of models performance among test years showed that fixing the minimum test size as 1 year for local k-fold testing (that is the case in similar studies) might be misleading as it could not show the fluctuations in modeling accuracy well. A minimum affordable size of at least one growing season was instead selected, tested and recommended in the current research.

AB Dissolved organic matter (DOM) is a critical component in freshwater ecosystem functioning. The main sources of DOM in lakes are allochthonous inputs from the catchment and autochthonous in-lake production. This study focused on the role of catchment characteristics on the qualitative and quantitative properties of DOM in small temperate lakes along a gradient of alkalinity. We examined DOM properties based on the optical absorbance and fluorescence measurements of water from 34 Estonian lakes. The content and composition of DOM were highly diverse in the lakes studied, e.g. the dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations varied from 3.2 to 53.0 mg L-1. Land cover, soil, and catchment hydrology and geology had substantial effects on DOM in lakes. Stock of soil organic carbon (SOC) in the catchment and water exchange rate (a descriptor of catchment hydrology, reciprocal of water residence time) had major positive effects on DOC concentrations. The aromaticity and molecular weight of DOM, i.e. the relative abundance of humic substances, and the dominance of allochthonous DOM increased with the drainage ratio (catchment area/lake area) and the percentages of bogs, and Dystric and Fibric Histosols (peat soils in transitional mires and bogs, respectively) in the catchments. Dominance of non-humic over humic substances and autochthonous over allochthonous DOM in lakes corresponded to calcareous catchments and higher percentages of Gleyic Rendzinas (thin soils on calcareous rock), Sapric Histosols (peat soils in mires) and open spaces (areas with little vegetation). Our results showed that soil variables had in general a greater effect than land cover and were more informative for describing the role of catchment characteristics on DOM in lakes. Patterns in DOM quantity and quality found in our study were similar to patterns found in other temperate lakes; therefore, our results have important implications for understanding catchment-lake interactions across the temperate region.

AB As a boundary condition, the lower bound is a prerequisite for constructing the Budyko framework. However, the traditional lower bound i.e., the horizontal axis is an analytical boundary without considering realistic conditions. In fact, under real-word condition, the lower bound of Budyko curves, representing the maximum value of water yield, should be located above the horizontal axis due to complicated constraints from basin characteristics, especially the precipitation seasonality, a key driver of runoff yield and a dominant factor in constructing Budyko framework. Thus, this study focused on exploring the reasonable location of the lower bound by adequately analyzing potential influence of precipitation seasonality. To do that, multiple hydrological simulations in basins under different climate and topography conditions were developed based on various precipitation scenarios constructed by using Markov chain with full range of precipitation seasonality. To fully understand the influence from precipitation seasonality on the lower bound, the water-energy supply and the basin characteristics were fixed by aridity index and hydrological model parameters, respectively. The results reveal a positive correlation between runoff coefficient and precipitation seasonality with an obvious higher location above the horizontal axis, indicating the horizontal axis is imprecise to describe the upper bound of runoff yield under real-word condition. Furthermore, a potential location of the lower bound above the horizontal axis in Budyko space was found based on runoff yield mechanism under real basin condition, representing a more appropriate boundary condition of Budyko framework.

AB Uncertainty in climate forcings causes significant uncertainty in estimating streamflow and other land-surface fluxes in hydrologic model simulations. Earlier studies primarily analyzed the importance of reproducing cross-correlation between precipitation and temperature (P-T cross-correlation) using various downscaling and weather generator schemes, leaving out how such biased estimates of P-T cross-correlation impact streamflow simulation and other hydrologic variables. The current study investigates the impacts of biased P-T cross-correlation on hydrologic variables using a fully coupled hydrologic model (Penn-state Integrated Hydrologic Model, PIHM). For this purpose, a synthetic weather generator was developed to generate multiple realizations of daily climate forcings for a specified P-T cross-correlation. Then, we analyzed how reproducing/neglecting P-T cross-correlation in climate forcings affect the accuracy of a hydrologic simulation. A total of 50 synthetic data sets of daily climate forcings with different P-T cross-correlation were forced into to estimate streamflow, soil moisture, and groundwater level under humid (Haw River basin in NC, USA) and arid (Lower Verde River basin in AZ, USA) hydroclimate settings. Results show that climate forcings reproducing the P-T cross-correlation yield lesser root mean square errors in simulated hydrologic variables (primarily on the sub-surface variables) as compared to climate forcings that neglect the P-T cross-correlation. Impacts of P-T cross-correlation on hydrologic simulations were remarkable to low flow and sub-surface variables whereas less significant to flow variables that exhibit higher variability. We found that hydrologic variables with lower internal variability (for example: groundwater and soil-moisture depth) are susceptible to the bias in P-T cross-correlation. These findings have potential implications in using univariate linear downscaling techniques to bias-correct GCM forcings, since univariate linear bias-correction techniques reproduce the GCM estimated P-T cross-correlation without correcting the bias in P-T cross-correlation.

AB Streamflow recession analysis provides valuable insights into catchment functioning that can be related to runoff generation, storage retention and baseflow dynamics. As an integrated characteristic, recession analysis is particularly useful in catchment comparison studies to help explain drivers of spatial and temporal variability in hydrological behavior. Here, five years of hourly streamflow data from 14, partly nested, catchments within a 68 km(2) boreal forest landscape in Northern Sweden were used to explore spatiotemporal variation in hydrological processes through recession analysis. The aim of this study was to better understand spatial variation in runoff generation and storage-discharge dynamics across the landscape, as well as the relation to landscape properties. Due to high collinearity between variables, partial least square regression was used to quantify the associations between recession characteristics and catchment properties, as well as to identify key variables controlling recession behavior. We analyzed recession characteristics using both an aggregated approach including all recession data and individual recession events. The analyses based on individual recession events, indicated that catchment topography, quantified by indices such as mean slope or elevation above the stream network, is a primary control on the recession behavior during relatively high flows, whereas catchment area gains importance when flows are relatively low. The proportion of sediment and deep soils also controlled recession behavior. Furthermore, we found that recession characteristics are influenced by both evapotranspiration (ET) and proxies of antecedent catchment storage, but that the patterns were different depending on catchment properties. ET was less influential in catchments with deeper soils and larger catchment area. Shifts in recession rates were primarily related to variation in storage, with faster streamflow recessions occurring during periods with low storage. The results demonstrate the influence of catchment properties on recession behavior, and we found great value in analyzing individual recession events for an increased understanding of spatial and temporal recession characteristics. When recession properties were lumped together, the relationships to catchment characteristics were obscured. This indicates the value of more detailed analyses, at least under the strongly seasonal hydroclimatic conditions of this site.

AB Rainfall-induced shallow landslides cause significant damage involving loss of life and property. Many hydrological processes such as rainfall infiltration, soil water dynamics, and slope stability are controlled by unsaturated soil properties, such as unsaturated hydraulic conductivity. Natural soils often exhibit a certain degree of anisotropy in hydraulic conductivity due to stratification and compaction mechanisms in soil formation processes.
   In this paper we investigate the effect of soil hydraulic conductivity anisotropy (SHCA) on hillslope hydrology and stability using a three-dimensional hydrological model coupled with a probabilistic infinite slope stability model. The model is applied in two independent case studies. The first aims to quantify the combined effect of different anisotropy ratios (lateral/normal saturated hydraulic conductivity) and hillslope morphologies (convex, concave, and planar) on slope stability. Anisotropy ratios are assumed in this case higher than one (1, 2, 10). Results show that increasing the anisotropy ratio (from 1 to 10) anticipates the failure time (from 12 to 9 h after the start of rainfall) and that in concave morphologies the unstable area tends to be wider than planar and convex. The second application aims to simulate the soil moisture dynamic and the probability of failure at different depths (100, 500, and 900 mm) of a stratified volcanic soil, making leverage on the model flexibility to accommodate SHCA. No assumptions are made on the anisotropy ratio in this case study. Our results, based on model parameter calibration and verification against in-situ soil moisture measurements during the year 2009, showed good model performance in simulating the soil moisture dynamic (Kling-Gupta Efficiency higher than 0.78) and confirmed no failure for the simulated year. The promising results support the aspiration that the physically based hydrological model can complement and improve the current predictions of landslide early warning systems.

AB Reliable and precise multi-step-ahead flood forecasts are crucial and beneficial to decision makers for mitigating flooding risks. For a river basin undergoing fast urban development, its regional meteorological condition interacts frequently with intensive human activities and climate change, which gives rise to the non-stationary process between rainfall and runoff whose non-stationary features is difficult to be captured by a non-recurrent data-driven model with a static learning mechanism. This study proposes a recurrent Adaptive-Network-based Fuzzy Inference System (R-ANFIS) embedded with Genetic Algorithm and Least Square Estimator (GL) that optimize model parameters for making multi-step-ahead forecasts. The main merit of the proposed method (R-ANFIS(GL)) lies in capturing the features of the non-stationary process between rainfall and runoff series as well as in alleviating time-lag effects encountered in multi-step-ahead flood forecasting. To demonstrate model reliability and effectiveness, the R-ANFIS(GL) model was implemented to make multi-step-ahead forecasts from horizons t + 1 up to t + 8 for a famous benchmark chaotic time series and a flood inflow series of the Three Gorges Reservoir (TGR) in China. For comparison purpose, two ANFIS neural networks of different structures (one dynamic and one static neural networks) were also implemented. Numerical and experimental results indicated that the R-ANFIS(GL) model not only outperformed the two comparative networks but significantly enhanced the accuracy of multi-step-ahead forecasts for both chaotic time series and the reservoir inflow case during flood seasons, where effective mitigation of time-lag bottlenecks was achieved. We demonstrated that the R-ANFIS(GL) model could suitably configure the complex non-stationary rainfall-runoff process and effectively integrate the monitored rainfall and discharge data with the latest outputs of the model so that the time shift problem could be alleviated and model reliability as well as forecast accuracy for future horizons could be significantly improved.

AB Dissipation of water (evapotranspiration and water vapor conversion in human water use activities) is one of the significant hydrological processes in urban area, which becomes more complicated with rapid urbanization. However, there are few systematic studies on water dissipation problems in urban area, and even the related concepts are unclear. This paper proposed the concept of urban water dissipation (UWD) to describe water vapor conversion in urban areas, and presented analysis on mechanism of UWD based on observing and monitoring experiments. The urban underlying surface was divided into five categories: buildings, paved ground, vegetation, water surface, and soil, in which the buildings have been scarcely discussed in terms of water dissipation. The dissipation of water in buildings plays a more and more important role in the urban water circulation system, as the water supply increases in urban areas. To reveal how much water is dissipated in the buildings, the main water dissipation processes in different kinds of buildings were analyzed, and the quantitative model was proposed. Based on the traditional evapotranspiration models for urban underlying surface and the proposed model for water dissipation in buildings, a new modelling system was built to simulate the total UWD. The new model system reflects the impact of human water use activities on urban water dissipation. It was applied in Xiamen city to simulate the UWD in 2000, 2005, 2010, and 2015. The results show that the UWD intensity increased with the urbanization process in Xiamen urban area in past 15 years. The UWD contribution rate increased for most land use types, except green land. For example, the water dissipation on residential land is the fastest growing one of all land use types, and its contribution rate surpassed that of green land to become the largest contributor in 2010. Because of the interference of strong human activities, the contribution rate of water dissipation on the social side continues increasing. The contribution rate of UWD on the social side was more than 40% in 2015, and it is still increasing.

AB Climate model simulations and observations show that there is a poleward expansion of the Hadley Circulation (HC) as well as a strengthening of the hydrological cycle in a warming climate. However, to establish a relation between the two phenomena in present day climate, simultaneous investigations of the HC and hydrological cycle changes using observational/reanalysis data are necessary, which is limited as compared to model simulations. In this regard, the present study employs relative humidity (RH), cloud fraction (CF) and precipitation (RF) parameters of the hydrological cycle and analyse their long term changes within the HC ascending and descending regions, simultaneously. Long term RH and CF data (1979-2016) are obtained from ERA-I reanalysis, and RF from GPCP precipitation dataset. The boundaries of the HC are identified using the meridional Mass Stream Function (MSF) metric, a metric that can track the mass motion in the atmosphere in the meridional direction. The analysis brings out the spatial pattern of the distribution of trends in hydrological parameters within the HC boundaries. The trends are observed to be significantly positive at the edges of the HC ascending region and significantly negative in the regions near the HC edges, insignificant (and in some cases, negative) in the deep tropics. This pattern is more or less consistent in RH, CF, as well as RF parameters. Thus the study shows that there are regions of positive as well as negative trends within the both ascending and descending regions. The results are found to be in accordance with the poleward expansion of HC and strengthening of the hydrological cycle. Besides, a northward shift in the HC ascending regions are also indicated from the analysis of the annual cycle of trend in precipitation. The current investigation is thus envisaged to contribute to further exploration on the relation between the HC changes and the intensification of the hydrological cycle in a warmer climate.

AB The flexibility and parsimony of transpositioning hydrographs using geomorphology-based deconvolution-reconvolution frameworks is particularly adapted to prediction in ungauged basins. Although already tested in semi-arid and oceanic-temperate hydro-climates, its predictions must be reproducible in a variety of hydrological contexts. The present study explores the nivo-pluvial hydrological regime using geomorphology-based hydrograph transposition between 21 gauged catchments ranging from 1.1 to 4466.4 km(2) in Quebec, Canada, and constitutes a case study in prediction in ungauged basins. Three metrics were used to assess model performance for each donor-target pair: Nash Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE), NSE calculated for the square root of discharge (NSEsqrt), and Volumetric Efficiency (VE). The classic transposition of hydrographs using the specific discharge ratio, used as a reference, was almost always outperformed by the geomorphology-based approach. Good but seasonally variable performance values were obtained for several pairs of catchments, revealing simultaneous structural and circumstancial effects. The difference in size, the physical distance between the gauged donor and its target ungauged catchment, and the season influenced the performance of the geomorphology-based transposition.

AB Analysis of hydrological impacts of land use change raises questions about whether, and how much, such impacts are misrepresented because of errors in river flow observations. In this paper, land use change impacts (represented by changes in watershed storage) and different ranges of discharge measurement error are compared to assess how errors in discharge measurement can potentially mask a land use change impact. Using a watershed from the Ethiopian highlands to exemplify this, we simulated five different levels of land use change impacts with five levels of watershed storage reductions (from 10% to 50% change) and the associated time series of runoff. Different levels of observation error were then introduced into these artificial time series. Comparison was made between every pair, i.e. a time series derived from a certain level of land use change (storage reduction) versus a time series corresponding to a given level of observation error, using a step-change t-test. Significant step-changes between pairs define the detectability of land use change impact. The analysis was made for the entire 30-year time series as well as for the most extreme annual weather conditions. The results showed that for the average year and wettest year, 75% or more error in observed discharge masks the maximum simulated land use change impact on hydrology. In dry years, a 50% error in discharge is enough to mask the same impact. Knowing (and improving) the level of data quality contributes to a better understanding of hydrological uncertainties and improves the precision in assessing land use change impacts. Both of these are essential elements in water resources development planning.

AB Tropical montane areas of Southeast Asia are exposed to high-intensity rainfall during the monsoon period. This is particularly problematic in areas where soils on steep slopes are cultivated as it can lead to heavy runoff, high soil erosion, and water pollution. The objective of this paper is to analyse the effect of the impact of raindrops on the dynamics of runoff on such steep fields. Experiments under simulated rainfall were performed at the plot scale (1 m(2)) to quantify water export from the surface of upland agricultural soils during overland flow events. Four 1 m(2) plots were divided in duplicated treatment groups: (a) control with no amendments, and (b) amended with pig manure. Each plot was divided into two 0.5 m(2) rectangular subplots. One subplot was designated as a rain splash treatment; the other sub-plot was covered with a 2 mm grid size wire screen that was located 12 cm above the soil surface. The purpose of the screen was to break the raindrops into fine droplets and to reduce fall height in order to drastically reduce their kinetic energy. Runoff was measured for each sub-plot. The results show that raindrop impact drastically enhances runoff generation on both bare soils and on manure amended soils. When the impact of raindrops was limited by screening, runoff was higher on amended soils than on bare soils.
   The temporal evolution of runoff was correctly modelled using a soil hydraulic conductivity that exponentially decreases over time of exposure to rainfall. Both experimental and modelling results showed that droplet energy induces a rapid evolution of the hydraulic properties of the soil surface due to crusting, resulting in a reduction of hydraulic conductivity and a concomitant increase in runoff rate.

AB The Boussinesq equation is usually used to describe one-dimensional unconfined groundwater movement. Solutions of this equation are important as they provide useful insights regarding the water table response to stream level variations and allow us to quantify the exchange flow between the stream and the aquifer. Due to the nonlinearity of the Boussinesq equation, the solutions are generally obtained using numerical methods. However, for certain classes of initial and boundary conditions there are both exact and approximate analytical solution techniques. This work focuses on the latter approach. A new mathematical technique for approximate solutions of the Boussinesq equation describing flow in horizontal unconfined aquifers induced by sudden change in boundary head is presented. The method applies to the problems of recharging and dewatering of an unconfined aquifer, and approximate solutions to both problems are derived. The solutions were obtained by introducing an empirical function with four parameters which might be obtained using a numerical fitting procedure. Results based on this technique were found to be easily calculated and to be in good agreement with those obtained using numerical calculation based on Runge-Kutta approach. A benchmark between the proposed solutions and five existing approximate analytical solutions shows that the present solutions are the most accurate approximate solutions among those tested. Applications of the solutions are presented in the context of estimating aquifer hydraulic parameters.

AB The role of hydrological connectivity in driving the dynamics of faecal indicator organisms (FIOs) in streams is poorly characterised. Here, we demonstrate how a tracer-aided hydrological model can be used within a coupled modelling approach to explore the role of connectivity in governing stream faecal coliform (FC) dynamics. To do so, we tested a hypothesis that in northern upland catchments, the dynamics of hydrological connectivity between major landscape units (hillslopes and riparian zone) and the stream exert a dominant control on stream FC loads by facilitating generation of runoff-driven FC fluxes. This hypothesis was conceptualised within a simple FC model that was coupled to a tracer-aided hydrological model developed for a small (3.2 km(2)) data-rich catchment in NE Scotland. The model was dual-calibrated to daily discharge and stable isotope data for the period August 2008 to September 2009; stream FC loads were also simulated but not used as a calibration target. Behavioural models successfully captured the general dynamics of the discharge and isotope data (average Kling-Gupta efficiencies of 0.72 and 0.53, respectively), providing confidence in the realism of simulated hydrological processes. The models simulated a seasonally-varying role of connectivity in driving stream FC loads. In summer, connectivity of the catchment hillslope was crucial in providing a source of FC to the riparian zone for transfer to the stream; this countered the decline in fresh FC input to the riparian zone in summer which reflected the seasonal movement of red deer (the principal source of FC) onto higher ground. In winter when this seasonal movement caused FC to be predominantly stored in the riparian zone, simulated hillslope connectivity primarily provided water to the riparian zone that permitted increased runoff generation and associated mobilisation of FC. Comparison of observed and simulated stream FC loads revealed model performance to be variable (R(2)range: 0-0.34). The better performance of the model in summer was consistent with hydrological connectivity being a dominant control on stream FC loads at this time. However, failure of the model to capture low FC loads in winter indicated that additional processes not considered in the model may also govern stream FC dynamics during this period. Incorporating the impact of freeze-thaw cycles on FC mortality, or a dilution effect of hillslope connectivity in winter, could be potential next steps in refining the hypothesis conceptualised in the FC model presented here. The novel coupled modelling approach used in this study successfully allowed a hypothesised role of connectivity in driving stream FC dynamics to be tested, contextualised by the accuracy of discharge and isotope-tracer simulations as indicators of hydrological process realism. Therefore, coupling FIO and tracer-aided hydrological models has clear promise for furthering understanding of FIO dynamics, which is a vital precursor to the successful management of microbial water quality. Based on the experiences in this study, a "roadmap" for the future development and application of coupled approaches is also presented.

AB Soil moisture plays a fundamental role in the mass and energy balance between the land surface and the atmosphere, making its knowledge essential for several hydrological and climatic applications. The aim of this study is to extend the current knowledge of soil moisture spatial-temporal variability at the catchment scale (up to 500 km(2)). The main implication is to provide guidelines to obtain soil moisture values representative of the mean behaviour at the medium-sized river basin scale, which is useful for remote sensing validation analysis and rainfall-runoff modeling. To this end, 23 measurements campaigns were carried out during a time span of 14 months at 20 sites located within the Upper Chiascio River Basin, a catchment with a drainage area of about 460 km(2) in the Umbria Region (central Italy). The data set allowed the analysis of both soil moisture temporal stability and its dynamics. On the basis of statistical and temporal stability approaches, it was investigated how factors such as climatic regime and geomorphology influence soil moisture behaviour. For the investigated area, the spatial variability of soil moisture was higher in dry periods with respect to wet periods, mainly due to the rainfall pattern characteristics during different periods of the year. Soil moisture values recorded during wet periods showed a better correlation than those recorded during dry periods. The maximum number of required samples, to obtain the mean areal soil moisture with an absolute error of 3% vol/vol, was found equal to 12. The temporal stability analysis showed that during wet periods just one "optimal" measurement point can provide values of soil moisture representative of the catchment-mean behaviour, while during dry periods the number of "optimal" measurement points became equal to two. Therefore, at the adopted spatial scale the use of a single measurement point can lead to significant errors. From the perspective of soil moisture dynamics, the decomposition of the spatial variance showed that the contribution of the time-invariant component (temporal mean of each site) was predominant on respect to the total spatial variance of absolute soil moisture data, for almost the whole observation period. Results provided guidance to optimize soil moisture sampling by performing targeted measurements at a few selected points representative of the catchment-mean behaviour.

AB Stable isotope ratios (delta H-2 and delta O-18) in precipitation not only show a certain response to climate change at different time scales, but also have strong linkages to extreme weather events such as tropical cyclones (hurricanes/typhoons). Typhoon activity in the coastal region of Southeast China is quite intense, bringing huge amounts of moisture; thus, contributing to extreme rainfall in this region. The existing isotope data in Southeast China is available on a monthly or daily temporal resolution, which is inadequate to study 1-2-day-long typhoon rainfall events at a particular location. In this study, hourly rainfall delta H-2 and delta O-18 data are collected for eight typhoon events from 2013 to 2017 in Fuzhou, Southeast China. The total correlation between delta H-2 and delta O-18 is obtained as delta H-2 = 7.41 delta O-18 + 0.81 (R-2 = 0.96, N = 220). All the eight typhoon events reveal a similar variability pattern in delta(18)Ovalues which can be divided into three stages. More positive delta O-18 values occur in the first and third stages, while the second stage is dominated by most negative delta O-18 values, exhibiting an inverted U-shaped pattern. The positive delta O-18 values during the first and third stages are governed by re-evaporation. The precipitation during the second stage has distinctly lower delta O-18 values than the weighted average delta O-18 of summer precipitation in Fuzhou. Some of these values are slightly lower than those of the water vapor over the Pacific Ocean's surface. No significant relationship is observed between precipitation delta O-18 and temperature as well as the amount of precipitation during the second stage. We hypothesize that the significant O-18-depletion is mainly caused by the 'rain shield effect', which refers to combination of large-scale convection, high condensation efficiency, and recycling of isotopically depleted vapor in rain shield areas leading to very negative delta O-18 values during typhoon system. These findings suggest the use of stable isotope ratios as important tracers of typhoon water.

AB Precipitation is a fundamental forcing variable in land surface modeling, controlling several hydrological and biogeochemical processes (e.g., runoff, carbon cycling, evaporation, transpiration, groundwater recharge, and soil moisture). However, precipitation estimates from rain gauges, ground-based radars, satellite sensors, and numerical models are affected by significant uncertainties, which can be amplified when exposed to highly non-linear land model physics. This work tests the hypothesis that precipitation data from different sources can be optimally merged to minimize the hydrologic response error in surface soil moisture simulations and maximize their correlation with ground observations (multi-objective optimization problem). This hypothesis is tested by merging three precipitation products (one satellite product, a ground-based dataset, and model-base estimates) that force a land surface model trained to minimize soil moisture anomalies. A Monte Carlo-based algorithm is developed to generate weights to linearly combine these precipitation datasets. Optimal combinations of weights are identified by minimizing the errors and maximizing the correlation between the model simulated soil moisture and the satellite-based SMOS soil moisture product. The proposed methodology has been tested over Oklahoma where high-quality, high-resolution (independent) ground-based soil moisture observations are available for validation purposes. Results show that there exist optimal combinations of these precipitation datasets that provide smaller errors and larger correlation coefficients between modeled soil moisture estimates and ground-based data with respect to forcing the land surface model with single precipitation datasets. Specifically, combining three precipitation products from different sources provides the largest correlation coefficient and the lowest root mean square error at several locations across Oklahoma.

AB Single-mission altimetric water level observations of rivers are spatially and temporally limited, and thus they are often unable to quantify the full extent of extreme flood events. Moreover, only missions with a short-repeat orbit, such as Envisat, Jason-2, or SARAL, could provide meaningful time series of water level variations directly. However, long or non-repeat orbit missions such as CryoSat-2 have a very dense spatial resolution under the trade-off of a repeat time insufficient for time series extraction. Combining data from multiple altimeter missions into a multi-mission product allows for increasing the spatial and temporal resolution of the data. In this study, we combined water level data from CryoSat-2 with various observations from other altimeter missions in the Mekong River Basin between 2008 and 2016 into one multi-mission water level time series using the approach of universal kriging. In contrast to former multi-mission altimetry methods, this approach allows for the incorporation of CryoSat-2 data as well as data from other long or non-repeat orbit missions, such as Envisat-EM or SARAL-DP. Additionally, for the first time, data from tributaries are incorporated. The multi-mission time series including CryoSat-2 data adequately reflects the general inter-annual flood behaviour and the extreme floodings in 2008 and 2011. It performs better than single-mission time series or multi-mission time series based only on short-repeat orbit data. The Probability of Detection of the floodings with the multi-mission altimetry was around 80% while Envisat and Jason-2 single-mission altimetry could only detect around 40% of the floodings correctly. However, small flash floods still remain undetectable.

This study used gauge-based gridded precipitation data obtained from Global Precipitation Climatology Centre (GPCC) to reconstruct historical droughts and downscale future precipitation projected by seven general circulation models (GCMs) of Coupled Model Inter-comparison Project phase 5 (CMIP5) under four Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP) scenarios, namely, RCP2.6, RCP4.5, RCP6.0 and RCP8.5. Support vector machine (SVM) and quantile mapping were used for downscaling and GCM bias correction, respectively. The model performances were assessed based on statistical measures. The historical and future projected precipitation data were finally used to characterize the seasonal droughts using Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) for different crop growing periods. The drought severity-area-frequency (SAF) curves for the historical (1961-2010) and three future periods (2010-2039, 2040-2069, and 2070-2099) were developed. The uncertainty band of future drought SAF curves was estimated using Bayesian bootstrap (BB) at a 95% confidence level. As a result, SVM was successful in downscaling the precipitation of all selected CMIP5 GCMs. The seasonal ensemble of GCMs projected an increase in precipitation ranging from 8% to 41% under all scenarios. The historical SAF curves revealed that for equal drought severity, larger areas are affected by droughts having higher return periods. Future projections of droughts revealed the increase in affected area for lower severity and return period droughts and the decrease for higher severity and return period droughts. The uncertainty bands of drought SAF curves with higher return periods were found much wider compared to those with lower return periods which indicates more uncertainty in the projection of higher severity and return period droughts.

AB Evasion of carbon dioxide (CO2) from lakes is a significant component in the continental carbon balance, but most current CO2 evasion estimates ignore dailyCO(2) fluctuations. To test the hypothesis that partial pressure of CO2 (pCO(2)) and CO2 evasion vary throughout a day due to biological processes driven by solar radiation, we conducted in-situ pCO(2) and ambient water measurements over eleven 10-h periods in a subtropical, eutrophic shallow lake from November 2017 to May 2018. In-situ measurements were performed at 7:00, 10:00, 14:00, and 17:00 Central Standard Time of the United States (CST), and CO2 evasion rates were estimated based on the field pCO(2) records. Strong daily declining trends of pCO(2) and CO2 flux were found throughout the seasons except for one winter day with unusually low temperatures. At 7:00, 10:00, 14:00, and 17:00 CST of a day, average pCO(2) were 1131, 839, 345 and 205 mu atm, respectively, while average CO2 fluxes were 80, 67, -10, and -34 mmol m(2) h(-1). Significant differences were found in average pCO(2) between any two measured time points in a day, while significant reductions in CO2 flux were observed between 10:00 and 14:00 CST and between 14:00 and 17:00 CST. pCO(2) and CO2 flux dynamics were most likely driven by the air-water exchanges during nighttime hours and mainly driven by aquatic metabolism in the daytime. These findings suggest possible large uncertainties in the estimation of carbon emitted from trophic lakes, highlighting the need for further research on diurnal pCO(2) fluctuation from different aquatic ecosystems to improve CO2 evasion estimation.

AB A multidisciplinary approach including environmental isotope (delta H-2, delta O-18 and H-3), hydrochemistry and electrical resistivity tools were used to revive a part of the drought prone areas of Vidarbha region, Maharashtra, India. In this study, groundwater recharge processes, monsoon characteristics, climate variables during evaporation in the region were evaluated using environmental isotope techniques. Additionally, electrical resistivity surveys were also conducted to understand the aquifer geometry and weak zones (fractures, lineament) for the sustainable groundwater development. Significant seasonal variation observed in stable isotopic composition, deuterium excess and tritium in precipitation helped to delineate the sources of vapour generating the rains during both the southwest and northeast monsoons. A negative correlation between stable isotopic content and amount of precipitation is observed. Two sources of groundwater recharge, namely, natural recharge from precipitation and contribution from artificial recharge structures (detention tanks) were deduced. Hydrochemical data also corroborates the above findings. Environmental isotope data show that the groundwater is predominantly recharged from the southwest monsoon, and the contribution from the northeast monsoon is insignificant. Tritium data indicate that the groundwater is modern and its residence time is of the order of a few years. Modelling of evaporative isotopic enrichment helped in estimating the climatic variables such as temperature and humidity during evaporation. Also, the recharge from the detention tanks was quantified based on isotope balance model. Aquifer geometry and groundwater potential zones were delineated in a part of the study area using electrical resistivity method. An integrated approach of multidisciplinary techniques is found to be effective in assessing the recharge processes and groundwater potentiality in drought prone areas.

AB With concerns about future catastrophic disasters, elevated CO2 concentration (eCO(2)), global warming and vegetation changes have received much attention globally. In recent years, studies have suggested controlling climate change should be based on regional impacts. However, regional quantitative assessments of respective and combination influences of CO2, temperature and vegetation variations on water resources remain limited. To address this issue, a comprehensive framework is developed. This framework integrates a dynamic vegetation simulation approach, a biosphere hydrological model and a variance-based sensitivity analysis approach which enables identification of predominant influential factors including their combinations. A medium-sized river basin in northeast China is used to illustrate the application based on different CO2 concentration and temperature rise assumptions. Validation using MODIS products shows the proposed approach can simulate Leaf Area Index (LAI) changes well. Results show sum of the influences of LAI and temperature variations on transpiration are more than 1.6 times higher than physiological effects of eCO(2) in growing seasons, which implies more water could be transpired than conserved with eCO(2), global warming and LAI changes. Results also show runoff increases with eCO(2) and decreases with increasing temperatures, but LAI changes play a dominate role in runoff decrease in hot summer. Therefore, considering LAI changes is of utmost importance in projections of future water resources, and severity of future water shortage could be underestimated if LAI changes are neglected. This research is useful in gaining insights into the complicated impacts of eCO(2), global warming and LAI changes on regional water security and sustainability.

AB In response to the severe water crisis in Iran, the Iranian government has changed its approach to the management of the country's water resources in different sectors from supply-side to demand-side management-an approach that relies on reducing water demand. In this regard, due to the high consumption of water in the agricultural sector, switching from rice cultivation that requires large amounts of water, to less water-intensive crops were considered a priority for the country, and the government banned the cultivation of rice as a water conservation policy. It is however very difficult for a government or any other power to enforce such a measure as it must be voluntarily accepted by end users (i.e., farmers) to be successful. Therefore, the success of this policy largely depends on what the public think of such measures. As such, it is crucial for policymakers to know how farmers think and behave in terms of these policies. The aim of this research is to accrue empirical evidence about farmers' intention toward changing the rice cropping system. To achieve our goal, we used a social-psychological theory known as the Theory of Interpersonal Behavior. A sample of 250 rice growers in southwest Iran was selected. Structural equation modeling showed that farmers' intention to change from rice cultivation to another crop is determined by personal norms, beliefs about their role and emotional considerations.

AB No attempts have been found on dealing with a set of non-competitive (or leader-follower-interactive) objectives when performing optimal groundwater remediation management. This study presents a multi-level nonlinear simulation-optimization (ML-NSO) model for groundwater remediation management when objectives should be satisfied at multiple levels. This model is formulated by integrating health-risk assessment (at the residential concern level), energy assessment (at the energy concern level) and contamination forecasting (at the environmental concern level) within a general framework. The capabilities and effectiveness of the developed model are illustrated through a real-world case located at Cantuar, Saskatchewan in Canada. Results facilitate (a) generating non-compromised solutions in association with the optimal strategies regarding groundwater injection and extraction, (b) displaying the distribution of contaminant concentration and carcinogenic risks for human health, and estimating the corresponding energy consumption, (c) resolving of conflicts and interactions among residential, energy, and environmental requirements. Moreover, the performance of ML-NSO model is enhanced by comparing with the single-level and multi-objective (SL-NSO and MO-NSO) models. Results show that ML-NSO model would assign higher priority on the residential and environmental concerns by tolerating a slight rise in energy cost The ML-NSO model would provide more comprehensive and systematic policies with considering the leader-follower relationship within system.

AB Optimization techniques have emerged as robust tools to aid the planning and design of urban drainage facilities in cost-effective ways. Such an effort was traditionally aided by heuristic methods (like genetic algorithm), which was generally time-consuming and also challenging in reaching convergence for large-scale problems with wide decision spaces. This study proposed a novel optimization method, denoted as two-level optimization (TO) scheme, for supporting rainwater storage pond design in an urban drainage system. Polynomial regression models were established as surrogate models to facilitate the solution of the optimization framework using traditional iteration algorithm. The TO scheme firstly sought the optimal layout of storage ponds on tributary sub-watersheds, and then proceeded to that of the mainstream one to yield the final solution. Through a case study, the TO scheme was compared with the traditional global optimization (GO) scheme where the physical simulation model was dynamically linked with genetic algorithm (GA) to seek the global optimal solution. The performance of two schemes under different constraint settings was analyzed. Effects of related issues such as start-point selection and mainstream design on tributary sub-watersheds were also discussed. The results showed that the proposed TO scheme is a prominent alternative to the traditional GO scheme to support urban water managers for a more science-based decision making towards storage pond implementation in large-scale practical problems.

AB In this study, a review of the overlay/index methods served for delineation of vulnerable zones in coastal aquifers affected by SWI is provided. Then, a more realistic presentation of the vulnerability mapping of coastal aquifers to SWI through modified GALDIT index method by incorporating the influential factors on SWI is established. The modifications on GALDIT method including incorporating the seaward hydraulic gradient (i) instead of the height of groundwater level above sea level (L) (so-called GAiDIT), and considering hydraulic gradient (i) as an additional parameter to the GALDIT (so-called GALDIT-i). Three GALDIT, GAiDIT, and GALDIT-i methods were evaluated with data from three coastal confined and phreatic/confined aquifers located in the south of the Caspian Sea, northern Iran. While no highly vulnerable zone was recognized by GALDIT method across three studied aquifers, averagely 43.4% and 50.5% of aquifers area were defined as highly vulnerable zones by GAiDIT and GALDIT-i, respectively. Furthermore, the final vulnerability maps obtained by GALDIT-i and then GAiDIT indicates higher correlation by three groundwater quality indices specific to SWI including f(sea) (r = 0.72 and 0.63) and GQI (r = 0.69 and 0.62) and also the distribution of TDS in groundwater (r = 0.71 and 0.61) compared with GALDIT (r = 0.33, 0.42, and 0.36, respectively). The values of vulnerability index obtained by GALDIT-i and GAiDIT are more strongly correlated with the length of SWI into the aquifer (L-x) based on Strack's analytical approach than GALDIT (r = 0.52, 0.36, and 0.32, respectively). The results of sensitivity analysis indicated that the hydraulic gradient, height of groundwater level above sea level, aquifer type, and existing status of seawater intrusion has the greatest impact on the groundwater vulnerability across the studied aquifers by GALDIT-i and GAiDIT methods. Results also indicated that serving the influential parameters in GALDIT methods regarding the hydrological and anthropogenic characteristics across the aquifer provide a more realistic characterization of the SWI. This modification leads to an accurate aquifer vulnerability mapping to SWI in aquifers characterized by transient anthropogenic drivers (e.g. pumping) which can be served as a promising tool for decision-making to properly assess and manage risk.

AB Laboratory evaporation experiments are used to determine soil hydraulic properties (SHP). In most cases, data are evaluated with the simplified evaporation method (SEM). Numerical simulations were used before to quantify the accuracy of the SEM and it was found that the method yields accurate estimates of SHP. However, previous tests neither accounted for heat flow, nor thermal fluxes of liquid water and water vapor, nor temperature effects on the transport properties. Since evaporation experiments are under most circumstances non-isothermal, past studies were therefore oversimplified and likely inaccurate. The objective of this article is to test the accuracy of the SEM using numerical simulations with a coupled model of water, vapor, and heat flow which is based on the Philip-de Vries theory and solves the surface energy balance. The model provides a state-of-theart description of the fluxes of water, vapor and energy during laboratory evaporation from bare soil. We present simulation results for different soil textures and resistances to vapor flow between soil and air, and analyze the accuracy of the SEM using the simulated data. The resulting average error for the water retention curve is smaller than 0.0025 m(3) M-3 and the relative error of hydraulic conductivity ranges from 5 to 15% for sandy loam and clay loam. For sand, the error in conductivity is higher but the structural shape of the conductivity curve is still identified relatively well. Compared to previous analyses of the evaporation method assuming isothermal flow, the average error of the SEM turned out to be only slightly higher.

AB Supraglacial debris is known to strongly influence the distribution of glacier surface melt. Since melt inputs drive the formation and evolution of glacial drainage systems, it should follow that the drainage systems of debris-covered glaciers will differ from those of debris-free glaciers. This would have implications for the proglacial runoff regime, subglacial erosion and glacier dynamics. This paper presents analysis of return curves from 33 successful dye injections into the extensively debris-covered Miage Glacier, Italian Alps. It demonstrates that the spatial distribution of supraglacial debris influences the structure and seasonal evolution of the glacial drainage system. Where the debris cover is continuous, melt is lower and the surface topography is chaotic, with many small supraglacial catchments. These factors result in an inefficient englacial/subglacial drainage network beneath continuous debris, which drains to the conduit system emanating from the upper ablation zone. Melt rates are high in areas of clean and dirty ice above the continuous debris. Runoff from these areas is concentrated by inter-moraine troughs into large supraglacial streams, which encourages the early-season development of an efficient englacial/subglacial conduit system downstream of this area. Drainage efficiency from the debris-covered area increases over the melt season but dye-trace transit velocity remains lower than from moulins on the upper glacier. Future runoff models should account for the influence of supraglacial debris on the hydrological system.

AB Drywells are increasingly used to capture stormwater runoff for surface infiltration and aquifer recharge, but little research has examined the role of ubiquitous subsurface heterogeneity in hydraulic properties on drywell performance. Numerical experiments were therefore conducted using the HYDRUS (2D/3D) software to systematically study the influence of subsurface heterogeneity on drywall infiltration. Subsurface heterogeneity was described deterministically by defining soil layers or lenses, or by generating stochastic realizations of soil hydraulic properties with selected variance (sigma) and horizontal (X) and vertical (Z) correlation lengths. The infiltration rate increased when a high permeability layer/lens was located at the bottom of the drywell, and had larger vertical and especially horizontal dimensions. Furthermore, the average cumulative infiltration (1) for 100 stochastic realizations of a given subsurface heterogeneity increased with sigma and X, but decreased with Z. This indicates that the presence of many highly permeable, laterally extending lenses provides a larger surface area for enhanced infiltration than the presence of isolated, highly permeable lenses. The ability to inversely determine soil hydraulic properties from numerical drywall infiltration results was also investigated. The hydraulic properties and the lateral extension of a highly permeable lens could be accurately determined for certain idealized situations (e.g., simple layered profiles) using constant head tests. However, variability in soil hydraulic properties could not be accurately determined for systems that exhibited more realistic stochastic heterogeneity. In this case, the heterogeneous profile could be replaced with an equivalent homogeneous profile and values of an effective isotropic saturated conductivity (K-s) and the shape parameter in the soil water retention function (alpha) could be inversely determined. The average value of K-s for 100 stochastic realizations showed a similar dependency to I on sigma, X, and Z. Whereas, the average value of alpha had large confidence interval for soil heterogeneity parameters and played a secondary role in drywell infiltration. This research provides valuable insight on the selection of site, design, installation, and long-term performance of a drywell.

AB Floodplains may alternate between discharge zones for regional groundwater and areas of recharge from river water during high-flow events. Understanding the mechanisms and timescales of recharge on floodplains is important for their management and for the protection of fragile ecosystems. The floodplains of the River Murray host important ecosystems, particularly remnant eucalypt forests that are vulnerable to changes in inundation, rising regional water tables, and salt accumulation. This study addresses floodplain recharge and groundwater mixing on the Pike and Katarapko floodplains of South Australia. At Pike,H- 3 activities of groundwater in the low hydraulic conductivity Coonambidgal Formation that crops out on the floodplain are similar to 0.25 TU, H-3 activities of groundwater in the underlying higher hydraulic conductivity Monoman Formation decrease from similar to 1 TU near the contact with the Coonambidgal Formation to < 0.02 TU at > 15 m depth. Groundwater C-14 activities are between 40 and 95 pMC but are less well correlated with depth. The H-3 or C-14 activities do not vary systematically with distance from the surface water channels on the floodplains. These observations imply that groundwater recharge at Pike is dominantly through the floodplain rather than through the channel banks. In contrast to the regional groundwater where total dissolved solids (TDS) concentrations are commonly > 35,000 mg/L, the TDS of groundwater on the floodplain is locally < 500 mg/L. A correlation between H-3 activities and TDS and the presence of groundwater with relatively low C-14 activities but above detection H-3 activities implies that recently recharged waters have mixed with regional groundwater in the floodplain sediments. The H-3 activities in these mixed waters implies that mixing occurs over a few years. By contrast, at Katarapko, the highest 3 H activities in the Monoman Formation groundwater (up to 2.35 TU) are closer to the Murray River, implying that recharge through the bank may occur. These contrasting patterns of recharge probably reflect local topographic controls. Understanding the recharge-discharge relationships are vital for managing proposed floodplain inundation programs aimed at improving ecosystem health.

AB The Fitero and Arnedillo geothermal systems are located in the NW part of the Iberian Range (Northern Spain). The geothermal reservoir is hosted in the Lower Jurassic carbonates, in contact with the evaporitic Keuper Fades. Thermal waters are of chloride-sodium type with discharge temperature of about 45 degrees C and near neutral pH. The Arnedillo waters are more saline with higher Na, Cl and sulphate contents, but lower Ca and Mg than the Fitero waters. All waters have attained mineral equilibrium at depth with calcite, dolomite, anhydrite, quartz, albite, K-feldspar and other aluminosilicates, except for the Fitero waters, which have not reached the equilibrium with the aluminosilicates. The calculated reservoir temperature is 81 +/- 11 degrees C in Fitero and 87 +/- 13 degrees C in Arnedillo. In order to identify the reasons for the differences found between the two systems some inverse and forward geochemical calculations were performed and the main water-rock interaction processes responsible for the chemical evolution of these waters have been evaluated.
   Halite dissolution has been found to be the triggering factor for the two most important geochemical processes in the system: a) albitisation process, due to the common ion effect (Na); and b) dedolomitisation process, associated with the salinity increase, which enhance the dissolution of anhydrite and, in turn, produces the precipitation of calcite (common ion effect, Ca) and the concomitant dissolution of dolomite.
   Halite dissolution may be an important driving force in the geochemical evolution of groundwater systems in contact with carbonates and evaporites, where equilibrium with K-feldspar, albite and anhydrite has already been attained. The evolution of the processes at pH, temperature and salinity ranges wider than those in the Fitero-Amedillo system has been theoretically examined with additional reaction-path simulations, in order to generalise the geochemical behaviour of these processes in other environments.

AB Riparian zones are essential to preserve water quality of rivers adjacent to large areas of irrigated agriculture. We used HYDRUS (2D/3D) to quantify the long-term (8 years) influence of crops (almonds, wine grapes and potatocarrot) irrigated with recycled water on water and solute exchange at the Gawler River interface in relation to vegetation buffer widths from 10 to 110 m. We found that under almond and annual horticulture the likely average annual water flow from the irrigated area to the river was nearly twice as much (2.1 and 1.8, respectively) that under wine grapes. The hydraulic exchange at river interface for different irrigated crops was found to be sensitive to the buffer widths. For wine grapes, almonds and annual horticulture, the average annual hydraulic balance reached an equilibrium at 20, 65 and 55 m buffer widths, respectively. Furthermore, for wine grapes, with a 20 m buffer width, the average annual load of salts became negligible. This study shows that buffer widths of 20, 60, and 40 m for irrigated wine grapes, almond, and annual horticulture, respectively, are needed to restrict the migration of salts to the river. Further refinements are possible by incorporating the influence of preferential flow paths, improved water stress response functions, and addressing the data limitations for calibration of the model for solute dynamics.

AB This paper presents novel flux and source term treatments within a Godunov-type finite volume framework for predicting the depth-averaged shallow water flow and sediment transport with enhanced the accuracy and stability. The suspended load ratio is introduced to differentiate between the advection of the suspended load and the advection of water. A modified Harten, Lax and van Leer Riemann solver with the contact wave restored (HLLC) is derived for the flux calculation based on the new wave pattern involving the suspended load ratio. The source term calculation is enhanced by means of a novel splitting-point implicit discretization. The slope effect is introduced by modifying the critical shear stress, with two treatments being discussed. The numerical scheme is tested in five examples that comprise both fixed and movable beds. The model predictions show good agreement with measurement, except for cases where local three-dimensional effects dominate.

AB In this research, a hybrid game theory and mathematical programming model (HGT-MPM) is proposed for solving trans-boundary water conflicts in Guanting reservoir basin (GRB) between two cities (Le., Zhangjiakou and Beijing) in north China. A water allocation model, which considers both water quality and quantity, is developed for optimizing water use and pollutant discharge in the two cities, maximizing the net aggregate benefits from these activities and reducing the costs for water supply and pollution removal. The initial rights of water use and pollutant discharge are allocated to the cities of Beijing and Zhangjiakou, as two players based on the incorporation of a negotiation method for ill-defined water rights within the watershed. At this stage, equal treatment of every player's benefit claim can be addressed. The strategy spaces of the two players are delineated through solving the proposed HGT-MPM with mutual benefit claim constraints. The Rubinstein bargaining solution method is employed to identify the equilibrium of bargaining. To achieve maximal benefits for the two players, starting from allocating the results of the second step, the concepts of Core and Nash solutions of cooperative games are used to generate stable basin-wide cooperative solutions. Both players find it beneficial to cooperate with side payment from the downstream to upstream. At this stage, the principle of maximum economic benefits is mainly considered. The results indicate that unclear initial water rights and pollutant discharge rights can be fairly defined through bilateral negotiations between upstream and downstream. Without side payment, the initial water rights and pollutant discharge allocation will be the final outcome, which is sub-optimal, although it is better than the status quo in term of both total and individual benefits. Full cooperation with side payment leads to the greatest total net benefits and the greatest benefits to each individual city. The results not only provide a basis to allocate trans-jurisdictional water rights and pollutant discharge rights in an equal and efficient way but also provide certain inspirations for management policy improvement, such as establishing a water right trading system.

AB Cyclic injection and production by a single well is a technique used in applications such as natural gas storage, compressed air energy storage and periodic pumping tests. The induced flow and saturation distribution can sometimes be modeled assuming two immiscible and incompressible fluids. An analytical solution is derived for such one-dimensional cyclic flow using the method of characteristics. The solution usually exhibits a front or discontinuity, in which case the contour integral method is applied in the derivation. Saturation (S) is expressed as a function of time, distance from well, mobility ratio and production to injection time ratio t(prod)/t(inj). Derivation is carried out for both linear S(x) and radial S(r) flow. Dependence of the solution on these parameters is explored and various cases are analyzed. A simple model for viscosity reduction of the reservoir fluid is presented, accounting for changes in mobility ratio, e.g., following cyclic injection for enhanced oil recovery. It is found that generally, for t(prod)/t(inj) >= 1 the solution converges to a periodic steady state, however, for t(prod)/t(inj) < 1 or when accounting for viscosity reduction, such a state is not reached and the injected phase penetrates deeper with each cycle.

AB Peatlands are a dominant land feature in the Athabasca Oil Sands Region (AOSR) of the Western Boreal Plain (WBP), comprising > 50% of the total land area, many of which are moderate-rich fens. The carbon stocks of moderate-rich fens in the WBP are susceptible to degradation through anthropogenic- and climate-related factors, yet, few studies have aimed to understand their hydrologic function. This study, located in a meltwater channel belt characterized by relatively thin outwash sand and gravel (similar to 6 m) underlying the peat, provides the first hydrological assessment of a moderate-rich fen in the AOSR. The lithology, hydrological function and groundwater geochemistry all point to the dominance of a local flow system supplying groundwater to the fen areas, evidenced by a thick (similar to 16 m) and shallow (similar to 7 m below ground surface) aquitard underlying the outwash, restricting hydrological connectivity between the fen and underlying regional aquifers. Vertical hydraulic gradients between the peat and underlying outwash aquifer, and horizontal hydraulic gradients between the fen and upland varied in response to both short-term and seasonal precipitation trends. Groundwater discharge to the fen was enhanced during wet periods characterized by high rainfall. Conversely, flow reversals (groundwater recharge; fen to underlying aquifer and upland), and subsequently, enhanced fen water table drawdown persisted during extended dry periods. This local groundwater flow-system influences recharge/discharge patterns at Poplar Fen, with hydraulic head in the underlying outwash aquifer highly susceptible to fluctuations in the presence and absence of precipitation-driven recharge from adjacent uplands. Moderate-rich fens similar to that studied here will likely become more susceptible to drying in the future due to a changing climate, leading to enhanced water table drawdown, peat oxidation and subsequent decomposition, vulnerability to wildfire, and seral succession to a more ombrogenous peatland system.

AB Understanding how catchment streamflow response varies in time and at different spatial scales is critical to assess runoff production and water availability in mountain areas. Very little work on comparing runoff generation processes in catchments of increasing size has been done in Dolomitic areas. In this research, we adopted a nested catchment (0.14-109km(2) ) approach to i) assess whether and how streamflow response at the seasonal and the rainfall-runoff event time scale varies with increasing spatial scale, and ii) identify the main factors controlling the temporal variability of streamflow response in three mountain catchments in the Italian Dolomites. We used precipitation and streamflow data from June to September of 13 consecutive years (2005-2017) available for all three catchments, and computed runoff coefficients, stormflow volumes, streamflow peaks and lag times between the rainfall centroid and the streamflow peak for 203 rainfall-runoff events occurred during the study period. Results show that, overall, specific streamflow and runoff coefficients decreased with the increasing spatial scale. However, this pattern was disrupted at the end of spring-beginning of summer due to the relevant snowmelt contribution to streamflow in the intermediate catchment characterized by the largest fraction of high-elevation areas, where deep snowpack accumulated during the winter. The probability distribution of runoff coefficients was very well represented by a Beta-distribution for all three catchments, suggesting that analogous factors controlled the variability of runoff coefficients. This was confirmed by multiple regression analysis that revealed that event rainfall amount, storm duration and 3-12 days antecedent precipitation (assumed as a proxy for antecedent wetness conditions) explained up to 0.81 of the variability of streamflow response, with a minor role of rainfall intensity. Further research is needed to assess whether detailed measurements of hydrological variables collected at the small catchment scale (< 1 km(2)) could be deemed as representative for the hydrological response of larger catchments.

AB Rigorous validation of the first-order detachment-transport coupling concept using different sediment sizes is nonexistent in the literature. We hypothesized that particle sizes in a sediment-laden flow can affect soil detachment. The objectives of this study were to investigate the relationship between detachment rates by rill flows and hydraulic parameters under low flow discharges, and to quantify the responses of soil detachment rates to sediment loads and median sizes. A concentrated flow flume test was conducted under three low flow discharges (0.00033, 0.00067 and 0.00100 m(2).s(-1)) and three sediment concentrations (50, 100 and 200 kg.m(-3)) with five median sizes (0.233, 0.204, 0.169, 0.115 and 0.078 mm). The results showed that the relationship between soil detachment capacity and shear stress fits the Water Erosion Prediction Project (WEPP) model well (R-2 = 0.89). Stream power, compared with shear stress, is a better hydraulic parameter in simulating soil detachment rates under different sediment concentrations. The soil detachment rates by sediment-laden rill flows were negatively related to both sediment loads and sediment median sizes, validating the first-order sediment feedback relationships used in the WEPP model. The overall responses of soil detachment rates to sediment loads and sediment median sizes followed multivariate linear relationships, further demonstrating the negative feedbacks of sediment load and size on soil detachment by rill flow.

AB Snowmelt is the principal control on the timing and magnitude of water flow through mountainous watersheds. The effects of precipitation type and quantity on storage and hydrologic connectivity in mountainous systems were explored by combining the observed stable isotope delta O-18 in rain, snow, snowmelt, and streamflow with numerically simulated hydrologic boundary fluxes and inverse techniques applied to transient travel time distributions (TTD) using StorAge Selection (SAS) functions. Hydrologic simulations of the East River (ER, 85 km(2)), a snow-dominated Colorado River headwater basin, for water years 2006-2017 were used to test a diverse set of snow accumulation scenarios. During the snowmelt period, the ER released younger water during high storage periods across seasonal and annual timescales (an "inverse storage effect"). Additionally, more young water was released from storage during wet years than during dry years. However, wet years also appeared to increase hydrologic connectivity, which simultaneously flushed older water from the basin. During years with reduced snowpack, flow paths were inactivated and snowmelt remained in the subsurface to become older water that was potentially reactivated in subsequent wet years. Incremental warming in hydrologic model simulations was used to evaluate TTD sensitivity to precipitation changing from snow to rain. Despite the altered timing of boundary fluxes because of warming, years with basin average precipitation above 3.25 mm d (-1) (1200 mm y(-1)) were resilient to temperature increases up to 10 degrees C with respect to annual water balance partitioning and streamflow TTD. In contrast, years with less precipitation were sensitive to increased temperatures, showing marked increases in the fraction of inflow lost to evapotranspiration. Younger water was preferentially lost to evapotranspiration, which led to an increase in the mean age of streamflow in drier years.

AB Satellite products, like all datasets, are subject to errors and uncertainties. Due to inherent biases embedded in satellite precipitation estimates, we present an error-adjustment approach based on the statistical differences between satellite precipitation products and in-situ observations (observed errors) employing two widely-used error models, namely that additive and the multiplicative error models, in an attempt to assess their suitability for the error correction of satellite-based daily precipitation estimates over northeast Austria. An error-adjustment technique based on the concept of the copula is adopted and applied to correct the supplied precipitation fields. It was found that IMERG precipitation estimates improved after error adjustment when compared to original satellite precipitation estimate (OSPE). The additive error model resulted in a better improvement by fitting the entire range of data when compared with the multiplicative error model. Moreover, the additive error model extracted the error with more accuracy and produced a better estimation of their characteristics, while the method based on the multiplicative error was less robust. However, the overall spatial dependence of the observed errors is reasonably preserved as that of the generated errors by copula. In addition, the validation results implied that the simulated realizations en or-adjusted band, encompassed the observed data reasonably. Moreover, the copula-based simulations associated with the additive error model performed much better in comparison to the multiplicative error model. Overall, by using the t-copula model with an emphasis on the additive error model and imposing the simulated error fields on the OSPE, one may generate multiple realizations of precipitation fields.

AB Adequate and accurate hydrological data is necessary to manage water resources, which are critical in developing countries where such information is limited. In recent years, global reanalysis datasets have been developed to provide this information in climatic fields and, more recently, in hydrologic fields. Nevertheless, these latest efforts have been limited to temporal coverage (similar to 30 years) and mostly simplified hydraulic scheme routing in rivers, which can be inadequate for regional and long term scale objectives. In this article, a dataset (called hydrological reanalysis across the 20th century [HRXX] in the Amazon Basin) was developed as a case study spanning back to the year 1900 through the use of: 1) a large-scale hydrologic-hydrodynamic model (MGB) forced by a long-term climatic reanalysis of rainfall (ERA-20CM) with bias removed; and 2) a data assimilation (DA) technique coupled with a localization method (LEnKF) to use several ground observations of daily discharge within a radius of influence. Several tests were assessed to find the best bias removal method, the optimal radius of influence for the localization method and the final HRXX dataset. A total of 114 hydrological ground observations of daily information were used for assimilation and validation purposes, and several statistics indexes were employed to assess their performance. Results indicate that both bias correction and the DA with localization method greatly improved the simulations. Ove restimations of the peaks in the open-loop (OL) (free run) simulation, mainly in the southern and northern regions of the Amazon Basin, were removed, and recession timing in the east-central region, as seen at the Obidos gauge station, were corrected. An average performance of similar to 0.6 and similar to 0.7 of the Nash-Sutcliffe and Kling-Gupta indexes was reached, even when only a few of the longest ground observations were used, which can be representative of the oldest periods (since similar to 1930). To assess extreme events, the Pearson correlation coefficient was used for maximum and minimum annual water level anomaly values, reaching 0.6 and 0.7, respectively, at the Manaus gauge station, which is remarkable considering that the analysis covers approximately 110 years. Considering the results of this case study and the global coverage of rainfall datasets, this methodology can be transferred to other regions in order to better estimate and create a hydrological reanalysis that adequately represents the hydrologic and hydraulic spatio-temporal fields.

AB Determining the bathymetric properties of a river, lake or reservoir is important for many reasons because it identifies location of sections with sedimentation or erosion which indicate the key processes and biophysical habitat status. This study used observational data of a 5 km section of the Danube River (transformed into a reservoir after 1972) to determine the best GIS interpolation method and the optimal number of sampling points to get an accurate description of the riverbed. Nine interpolation methods were used to generate bathymetric maps of the Danube course, between km 955 and km 950, in the area of Iron Gates reservoir, using a variable number of points (n = 1943; n = 4328; n = 17139), obtained by single beam echo sounder. Six methods of deterministic interpolation have been used: Inverse Distance Weighting (IDW) - criteria automatically determined (CAD) and manually determined (MD); Local Polynomial Interpolation (LPI) - criteria automatically determined (CAD) and manually determined (MD); Radial Basis Function (RBF) - fully regularized spline CRS; Radial Basis Function RBF - spline with tension SWT, and three geo-statistics methods: Ordinary Kriging - OK, Simple Kriging - SK, Universal Kriging - UK. Cross-validation and bathymetric Digital Elevation Models (DEM s) analysis were used to evaluate the accuracy of the estimated data and maps. The two interpolation methods, Inverse Distance Weighting (IDW-MD) and Simple Kriging (SK), provide satisfactory results, even in the case of a small number of points (n = 1943). If the number of measured points grows and a section grid (perpendicular/longitudinal) is developed, the DEM s bathymetric accuracy improves significantly, especially in the case of complex morphology, even if the positive and negative forms of the bed lead to sudden changes in the measured values. The obtained results revealed differences between the interpolation methods used, particularly in the case of a small number of points measured per perpendicular trajectories, but by the addition of points on longitudinal paths, a significant improvement of the bathymetric maps is obtained.

AB Understanding CO2 migration and distribution in fault systems is essential to evaluate long-term secure CO2 storage and prevent hazardous effects caused by CO2 leakage. To elucidate the role of the fault system on subsurface CO2 migration and leakage processes, a two-dimensional multi-phase transport model was constructed to represent Little Grand Wash (LGW) and Salt Wash (SW) faults, where naturally originating CO2 is being leaked to the surface. According to simulation results, buoyant CO2 leaked through various pathways including the faults themselves, fault offsets, and damaged caprock. Because of both fault systems and caprocks serving as barriers, multiple trapped CO2 plumes were developed in this region. Presence of trapped CO2 plumes in the subsurface is supported by multiple field-observations (e.g., elevated soil CO2 fluxes, travertines, and CO2-driven cold-water geysers/CO2 springs) adjacent to both LGW and SW faults. Sensitivity studies were conducted with different permeabilities for faults and caprock, various CO2 source locations, and differing fault parameters (e.g., fault throw and cutoff angle), which affected subsurface CO2 distribution including size, shape, and location of trapped CO2 plumes. Finally, such trapped CO2 plumes have played a key role in the development of CO2-driven cold-water geysers in these regions.

AB Vegetation growth in Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) is a crucial process for quantifying ecohydrological modelling, as it influences evapotranspiration, interception, soil erosion and biomass production. The simplified version of Environmental Policy Integrated Climate (EPIC) in SWAT was originally designed for temperate regions and naturally based on temperature to simulate growth cycles of vegetation. However, tropical or subtropical vegetation growth is mainly controlled by rainfall. Due to this limitation, current SWAT simulations in tropics and subtropics have been facing a series of problems on vegetation dormancy, water balance and sediment yield. Therefore, we proposed an approach to enhance the modelling of SWAT vegetation dynamics with remotely sensed leaf area index (LAI), to finally increase the applicability of SWAT in tropical or subtropical areas. Spatially and temporally continuous LAI products (1 day, 500 m) from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) observations were integrated into SWAT to replace the LAI simulated by built-in EPIC module. Two advanced filter algorithms were employed to derive a downscaled LAI (30 m) to keep a consistent spatial scale with the size of Hydrological Response Units (HRU) and open data (i.e. SRTM, 30 m), and the source code of the plant growth module were correspondingly modified to incorporate the downscaled LAI into SWAT. To examine the performance of our proposed approach, a case study was conducted in a representative middle-scale (6384 km(2)) subtropical watershed of Meichuan basin, China, and detailed analysis was performed to investigate its ecohydrological effects, such as streamflow, sediment yield and LAI dynamics from 2001 to 2014. Model performances were compared among three scenarios: (1) original SWAT, (2) SWAT with a corrected plant dormancy function, and (3) modified SWAT after integration of MODIS LAI (our proposed method). Results showed that the modified SWAT took advantage of downscaled MODIS LAI and produced more reasonable seasonal curves of vegetation cover factor (C) of plants than the original model. Correspondingly, the modified SWAT substantially improved streamflow and sediment simulations. The findings demonstrated that SWAT model can be a useful tool for simulating ecohydrological process for subtropical ecosystems when integrated with our proposed method.

AB The quasi-exact implicit (QEI) analytical formulation of Haverkamp equation, which might be also known as Parlange model, and its one- and two-term approximate expansions are among the mostly used equations for in situ determination of soil sorptivity, S, and saturated hydraulic conductivity, K-s, from unsaturated one-dimensional (1D) cumulative infiltration into soils. However, from practical point of view, the approximate expansions are only valid from short to intermediate times and the QEI analytical formulation has a complex resolution, which makes its use complicated in inverting procedures. Therefore, alternative functions are needed to compute cumulative infiltration for longer times and improve inverting procedures for easier, more robust and accurate predictions of S and K-s. In this regard, current work presents and evaluates a new three-term approximation of the QEI analytical formulation. As a first step, we checked the accuracy of the proposed three-term approximate expansion with respect to the QEI formulation for three different soils (sand, loam and silt) in order to define its time domain validity. Next, the accuracy of the three-term approximate expansion to estimate S, K-s and the beta parameter was compared to those obtained with one- and two-term approximate expansions. Lastly, a large dataset of field experimental data was inverted using the proposed three approximate expansions and the QEI analytical formulation, and goodness of fits predicted and measured cumulative infiltration curves and accuracy of the parameters (S, K-s and the beta) estimates were compared. The results revealed that the three-term approximate has a larger validity time interval compared to one- and two-term approximate expansions, which allows its use for larger infiltration times durations resulting in more accurate estimates of K-s. Its capability of estimating S is also improved. The accurate prediction of beta parameter is not still guaranteed for none of the approximate expansions. Compared to the one- and two-term approximate expansions, the experimental infiltration data usage revealed that the three-term approximate expansion resulted in higher performance and better prediction of hydraulic parameters.

AB The Budyko framework, used for water balance studies, is an effective tool that estimates the actual evapotranspiration, balancing between energy and water availabilities. In this study, we investigate eight Budyko framework equations as well as the GR1A and GR2M models on the Nile tributary Blue-Nile catchment. On the annual time scale, all investigated models and equations show poor results. Moreover, the resulting errors on the monthly scale show a clear pattern of seasonality and autocorrelation. To overcome such deficiencies, we propose a time series SARIMA model, to fit the error term of the best performing Budyko equation. Building on the time series capabilities, we extend the Budyko framework to allow the incorporation of values of precipitation and potential evapotranspiration from previous months. The selected performance criteria are the Nash-Sutcliffe and Kling-Gupta efficiencies, as well as the coefficient of determination and bias. The novel hybrid SARIMAX-Budyko model exhibits high performance not only on the Blue Nile but also on other five major rivers worldwide. The proposed model outperforms the previously published Budyko equations, as well as the GRIM and GR2A as benchmark models, in almost all performance criteria and especially on the annual time scale.

AB Domestic sewage is a key source of surface water pollution in rural areas of developing countries, especially in China, where a large amount of highly concentrated nutrients is directly discharged into the receiving waters. Therefore, in this study, a set of ecological ditch systems was designed to remove nutrients from rural domestic sewage in the hilly area of the central Sichuan Basin, China. The results show that the total nitrogen (TN) removal efficiencies range from 14.87% to 84.24%, with an average of 47.97%, and the total phosphorus (TP) removal efficiencies range from 13.93% to 86.22% with an average of 49.79%. The highest daily TN and TP removal rates are 13.06 and 1.30 g M(-2)d(-1), respectively, and the average removal rates are 3.19 g m(-2)d(-1) for TN and 0.28 g m(-2)d(-1) for TP. Our results indicate that the ecological ditch system to treat rural domestic sewage with high nutrient concentrations can be used in the study area or areas with similar topography. Furthermore, we found that the nutrient removal efficiencies exhibit considerable seasonal variations and are sensitive to the hydraulic flow rates. The nutrient removal capacity of the ecological ditch system is therefore somewhat limited. Based on our findings, the use of winter-hardy wetland plants and increase of the size of the filter unit are recommended to make the ecological ditch system more efficient and maintain high nutrient removal rates year-round. Furthermore, we suggest that regular mowing of plants and the removal of accumulated sediment are necessary to manage the ecological ditch system.

AB Aridland springs maintain groundwater-dependent habitats for aquatic and terrestrial species. San Solomon Spring (Texas, USA) is part of a regional karst spring complex in the Chihuahuan Desert that supports several species of federal and state conservation interest. However, drought, climatic variability, and groundwater abstraction threaten discharge and water quality. In the surrounding Delaware Basin, expansion in unconventional oil and gas development using hydraulic fracturing may increase demands on aquifers that also provide flows to the springs. A critical knowledge gap limiting habitat conservation and sustainable groundwater abstraction is that the flow system is not well understood. While the source of most spring discharge is from a Pleistocene-recharged regional flow system, evidence suggests that a modern local flow component provides fresh water influx. However, the exact sources, mechanisms, and timing of localized recharge are unknown. To address these questions, this study combined long-term in-situ spring water quality monitoring (specific conductance, turbidity, and temperature) data with weather station-corrected 4 km gridded precipitation data to quantify the lag response at San Solomon Springs to mesoscale storm events and to delineate potential local recharge zones. Between April 2011 and March 2012, 26 event-flow responses were documented, with an average lag of 43 days between storm event and spring response. Response time varied depending on storm magnitude, spatial extent, and antecedent soil moisture conditions. Cross-correlation analysis of spatially distributed precipitation indicated zones of potential local recharge in the mountain block/mountain front zones and alluvial channels issuing from the Davis Mountains. Some local flow paths appear to cross known watershed boundaries, suggesting that groundwater abstraction in sensitive capture zones should be managed carefully to maintain spring flows and conserve habitats.

AB The relevance of hydrological processes varies in space and time resulting in typical temporal patterns for catchments. Contrasting catchments moreover differ in their catchment metrics. Hydrological models claim to be able to reproduce typical temporal patterns of dominant processes using site-specific model parameters. Thus, patterns of temporal dynamics in dominant modelled processes and their corresponding dominant parameters are a fingerprint of how a model represents the hydrological behaviour of a catchment and how these process patterns vary between contrasting catchments.
   In this study, we demonstrate how catchment metrics, modelled processes and parameter dominances can be jointly used to characterise catchments. We assess how catchment characteristics are represented in spatiotemporal process dynamics in models and how to understand the reasons for hydrological (dis)similarity among catchments along a landscape gradient. For this purpose, catchment metrics which characterise contrasting landscapes (lowland, mid-range mountain and alpine catchments) are related to dominant processes and parameters which were provided by a temporally resolved sensitivity analysis (TEDPAS) and simulations of a hydrological model.
   Our study shows that the applied model is able to represent the different processes and their seasonal variability according to the specific hydrological conditions of the study catchments. By analysing catchment metrics, modelled processes and model parameters jointly, we show that the largest differences are identified for the alpine catchment, whilst similarities are found among the other catchments. Following a landscape gradient, high flow phases are dominated by different flow components. In contrast, the model shows groundwater dominance in low flow phases in non-alpine catchments while in the alpine catchment low flows in winter are mainly controlled by snow processes. The joint analysis of catchment metrics, temporal dynamics of dominant processes and parameters can therefore be used to better disentangle similarities and differences among catchments from different landscapes.

AB Managing water resource systems usually involves conflicts. Water recognizes no borders, defining the global geopolitics of water conflicts, cooperation, negotiations, management, and resource development. Negotiations to develop mechanisms for two or more states to share an international watercourse involve complex networks of natural, social and political system (Islam and Susskind, 2013). The Kabul River Basin presents unique circumstances for developing joint agreements for its utilization, rendering moot unproductive discussions of the rights of upstream and downstream states based on principles of absolute territorial sovereignty or absolute territorial integrity (McCaffrey, 2007). This paper analyses the different stages of water conflict transformation between Afghanistan and Pakistan. It first examines historical disputes between the upstream and downstream riparians, revolving around contending rights claims, resulting in zero-sum confrontations with one party's loss as another's gain, possibly ending in confrontation. The paper then formulates a decision support tool, a mechanism for transforming conflict into cooperation, and concludes by introducing practical methods for identifying basin needs and sharing benefits, enabling riparians to negotiate a win-win process.

AB Accurate estimation of soil hydraulic parameters is essential for modeling of water flow and solute transport in unsaturated soil. Ensemble-based methods have been proposed to provide the optimal monitoring (data-collection) strategy to improve hydraulic parameter estimation. To guarantee the performance, however, these methods usually require relatively large ensemble sizes, leading to high computational cost. To this end, we develop an efficient sequential probabilistic collocation-based optimal design (SPCOD) method, which integrates the adaptive ANOVA (analysis of variance)-based probabilistic collocation-based Kalman filter with the sequential optimal design. At the forecast step, the probabilistic collocation method is used to construct a reducedorder surrogate for system model with the adaptive ANOVA-based polynomial chaos expansion (PCE). At the design step, an information metric in the PCE form is derived to evaluate candidate monitoring strategies. The one with the maximum expected information metric value is chosen as the optimal. At the analysis step, the PCE coefficients are sequentially updated by a square-root Kalman filter with the real-time measurements obtained from the optimal monitoring strategy. Two synthetic numerical cases involving water flow and solute transport in the vadose zone are employed to illustrate the performance of the proposed method. The results show that: (1) compared with conventional fixed monitoring strategies, the optimal monitoring strategy designed by SPCOD provides more accurate parameter estimation and state prediction; (2) compared with our previously developed sequential ensemble-based optimal design method (Man et al., 2016b), the new approach provides a more robust and accurate optimal monitoring design with nearly the same computational cost.

AB Piano key weirs (PKWs) are acquired and developed for free surface control structures which improve their performance by increasing the storage capacity and flood evacuation. In this study, the potential combinations of two popular artificial intelligence data-driven models (Al-DDMs) of multi-layer perceptron neural network (MLPNN) and adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) with four meta-heuristic optimization algorithms (particle swarm optimization, genetic algorithm, firefly algorithm & moth-flame optimization) are assessed for predicting the PKW's flow rate. Comparing the outcomes of the ten standard and hybrid Al-DDMs with three empirical relations based on several statistics and diagnostic analysis (such as the Taylor diagram) for estimating the flow rate shows that the AI-DDMs can predict the passing flow more accurately. In addition, the particle swarm optimization and firefly algorithm meta-heuristic algorithms improve the performance of ANFIS and MLPNN, respectively. The Mann-Whitney test for investigating the differences between two independent applied models indicates a significant difference between the Al-DDMs and two of the empirical relations at the 95% confidence level.

AB High-frequency water quality monitoring is increasingly used in examining the nutrient fluxes within catchments. Despite this, no studies have assessed the impact of monitoring frequency on the uncertainty of nitrate estimates obtained from distributed or semi-distributed catchment models. This study aims to evaluate the impacts of two different frequencies of nitrate sampling on the performance of a catchment hydrology model, including the uncertainty in both predictions and calibrated parameters. The investigation uses the HYPE model to simulate streamflow and nitrate concentrations (2010-2015) in the Selke catchment, a heterogeneous mesoscale catchment in central Germany. The Bayesian inference scheme of the DREAM code was employed for calibration and uncertainty analysis, and to explore differences between fortnightly and daily nitrate sampling strategies. The results indicate that: (a) the posterior uncertainty intervals of nitrogen-export process parameters were narrower when the model was calibrated to daily nitrate measurements, while similar maximum likelihood parameter values were obtained regardless of the sampling frequency; (b) the model calibrated using daily nitrate data better represented both daily and fortnightly nitrate measurements relative to that obtained using fortnightly sampling; (c) the daily nitrate dataset produced significantly smaller parametric prediction uncertainty, but only modest reduction in total prediction uncertainty, relative to the fortnightly nitrate dataset; (d) model structural error and measurement errors are the primary sources of total prediction uncertainty, and these combine to inhibit the benefits of high-frequency monitoring. We conclude that the adequacy of sampling frequency is dependent on model structure and measurement errors, such that higher-frequency nitrate monitoring may not markedly reduce the uncertainty of nutrient predictions, depending on other levels and sources of uncertainty.

AB The time that rainfall takes to reach the outlet of a catchment as discharge (transit time) is a fundamental and integrated measure of catchment hydrological processes and solute transport mechanisms. As such, many efforts have been dedicated to its understanding and quantification. However, defining and ranking which factors, internal and external to the system, control the distributions of transit time is still an open challenge. Here, we develop a two-stage approach to explore climate and topography controls on transit time, using a fully distributed hydrological model coupled with a transport component. Specifically, we apply the model to two synthetic topographies under five observed climate regimes. With this setup, water fluxes from two years of daily rainfall events are singularly tracked across the catchments to then derive the distributions of transit time and fraction of young water for each combination of topography and climate. Results highlight a considerable variability of transit times in all climates and a pronounced effect of topography within a given climate. They further reveal that for wet climates it is possible to define a curve describing water transit time as a function of cumulative discharge that only depends on topographic properties. On the contrary, in dry climates the variability of transit time and young water fraction is much larger and not amenable to a simple summary. Despite simplifications, quantitative model-based inferences of transit time distributions are useful to better understand how climate and topography affect catchment functioning.

AB Reducing agricultural runoff year-round is important, in particular during snowmelt events on landscapes that receive wintertime applications of manure. To help inform manure guidelines, process-level data are needed that link management scenarios with the complexity of snowmelt, hence runoff. Albedo and radiative energy fluxes are strong drivers of thaw, but applying these mechanistic measurements across multiple, plot-scale management treatments over time presents a logistical challenge. The objective of this study was to first develop a practical field approach to estimate winter albedo in plot-scale field research with multiple management scenarios. The second objective was to quantify the radiative drivers of snowmelt by measuring fluxes after wintertime liquid manure application. Six management treatments were tested in south-central Wisconsin during the winters of 2015-2016 and 2016-2017 with a complete factorial design: three manure application timings (early December, late January, and unmanured) and two tillage treatments (conventional tillage versus notillage). A multiple linear regression model was developed to estimate albedo with digital imagery and readily-obtained site characteristics. Manure timing had a significant effect on radiative energy fluxes and tillage was secondary. January applications of liquid manure produced an immediate and lasting decrease in albedo, which resulted in greater net radiation absorbed by snowpack and subsequent energy available for snowmelt. Later applications of liquid manure accelerated snowmelt, which increased runoff losses and posed a challenge for nutrient retention from the liquid manure during thaw.

AB Colloid transport through complex and dynamic (i.e. non-steady-state) hydrologic systems is rarely studied, owing to the difficulty of constraining initial and boundary conditions and quantifying colloid-porous media and colloid-colloid interactions in transient flow systems. Here we present a particle tracer experiment conducted on a sloped lysimeter receiving periodic rainfall events for 10 days. Four unique, DNA-labelled particle tracers were injected both in sequence and in parallel, together with a conservative tracer (deuterium), over the course of the first day and allowed to move through the system. Discharge-particle tracer concentration curves and the spatial distribution of particle tracer mass retained in the soil at the end of the experiment were found to be highly dependent on the timing of the tracer injection and the precipitation input and subsequent dynamic response of the water table. Overall, neglecting the total DLT recovery rate, the DLT particle tracer breakthrough trend (DNA-labelled particle tracer 4) was similar to deuterium and decreased over time with the exception of a few peaks later in the experiment. The individual particle tracer breakthrough curves suggest a complex system with different fast transport mechanisms (e.g. capillary barrier and size exclusion effect) and slow retention-release mechanisms (e.g. straining, physical-chemical adsorption), which resulted in particle tracers transferring faster than deuterium in the first 10 h of the experiment but being exceeded by deuterium soon after deuterium started to break through. The experiment not only highlights the interaction of repeated colloidal pollution events in hydrologic systems with different pre-event saturation conditions, but also the benefits of using multiple synchronous or sequential tracer applications to dissect explicit formulations of water flow and colloid transport processes in complex and dynamic hydrological systems. Such explicit process formulations could help improve understanding hydrologically-controlled transport through catchments and the quantitative prediction of these processes with water quality models.

AB The chemistry of precipitations and stream waters in the critical zone of a small granitic catchment mainly covered by grassland has been investigated backward (period 1990-1997). Major elements concentrations, fluxes and budgets at annual and seasonal scales allowed evaluating the catchment response to variation trends in atmospheric deposition and hydrological patterns. Acid precipitation was efficiently buffered by soil cations exchange and mineral weathering processes, as attested by the dominance of Ca and HCO3 in stream waters. A decrease of sulfate acidity in precipitation following clean air measures was accompanied by an increase of alkalinity and a decrease of sulfate in stream waters. Waters of short residence time from water-saturated areas in the valley bottom and rapid shallow circulations within slopes were a very effective diluted weathering end-member contributing to stream outlet in high flow conditions, whereas evapotranspiration from saturated areas and/or deep waters with long residence time influenced the stream water concentration pattern in low flow conditions.
   Water discharge controlled the variations of the annual and seasonal budgets of major elements, except for nitrate and sulfate, mainly stored during summer. Soil legacy sulfate was mainly released during the first autumn stormflows, with high peak concentrations decreasing rapidly from 1990 to 1992 and disappearing afterwards. The output water flux was the main driver of the weathering rate in the acidification recovery period 1993-97, contrary to the first period 1990-92 when acidification was still under way, as attested by the weathering plateau (constant Si/Sigma BC ratio). At that time, the intense weathering testifies the disturbance caused by acidification process. However, this critical zone was resilient enough to allow rapid and significant recovery over a few years following sulfur atmospheric abatement. For the future, the atmospheric nitrogen deposition pressure remains still challenging in a global change context, which argues for the necessity of long-term observatories.

AB The groundwater tracers, deuterium ( H-2 or D) and oxygen-18 (O-18) are widely used to determine groundwater recharge origin, rate and temperature. Quantitative methods able to interpret delta D and delta O-1(8) mobility in the subsurface, especially under high pressure and temperature conditions, remain the focus of ongoing research. Here we developed an isotope transport module as an add-on to the TOUGH2 simulator, which is able to describe the evolution of delta D and delta O-1(8) in groundwater induced by advection, dispersion, water-rock interaction, and fractionation due to changes of water phase and density. The new model was tested by modelling the groundwater flow, temperature, fluid density and isotopic composition in a faulted, geothermal system in the Guide Basin, China. We found that the density-driven flow induced by temperature variations can lead to isotope fractionation between low- and high-density water. In addition, the density-driven flow creates multiple flow systems in the fault damage zone, increasing the complexity of the spatiotemporal isotope distribution. The results indicate that in scenarios where a density contrast occurs, such as in geothermal systems, the relationship between delta D and delta O-1(8) in recharge water and discharging groundwater can only be fully understood if the coupled processes of fluid flow, heat transport and isotope fractionation in the subsurface are accounted for.

AB Water quality and quantity data are essential for water resources management, but historical records are not always available at sites where information is required, especially for water quality (WQ) data because of the high costs of implementing and operating water quality monitoring networks. This leads to the impossibility/impracticality of monitoring all streams/watersheds in a region under monitoring. A novel statistical approach is proposed for the estimation of WQ characteristics (25th, 50th, and 75th percentiles) at ungauged streams/watersheds. The proposed approach is based on developing a WQ causes-effects functional relationship, which has not been done before. The WQ causes are represented by the watershed physiographic (natural and anthropogenic) attributes and the effects are represented by the WQ characteristics. For a target ungauged stream/watershed: (i) a canonical correlation analysis-based-neighborhood approach was applied to identify homogeneous gauged watersheds; and (ii) nonlinear regression models were then calibrated using data available at the selected gauged watersheds to develop the causes-effects functional relationship between the physiographic attributes as predictors, and WQ characteristics as dependent variables. Once the regression models were validated, the physiographic characteristics of the target ungauged stream/watershed were used to estimate its WQ characteristics. The jack-knife validation method was applied to evaluate the proposed statistical approach using 50 gauged streams from the Nile-Delta of Egypt. Results showed accurate and precise estimation of the Electric Conductivity and Sodium percentiles. For Iron, relatively less precision was obtained due to the absence of attributes that can describe the Iron concentrations.

AB Over the past decades, a new aquifer test technology (sequential pumping tests or hydraulic tomography, HT) has been developed and successfully applied to many field sites to delineate the spatial distributions of hydraulic properties (e.g., transmissivity (7) and storage coefficient (5)). Yet, the reproducibility of its estimated T and S fields and the predictive capabilities of the estimates for different flow scenarios at different time periods remain unexplored. That is to say, if the estimated fields based on sequential pumping tests conducted during different years are the same since the geologic formation and processes may have undergone changes. In order to answer this important question, this study first compares the drawdown-time behaviors from the sequential pumping tests (SPTs) conducted in 2010 with those conducted in 2012 at a field site and then finds they are similar but different in detail. It then uses these data to estimate the T and S fields and checks the reproducibility of the estimates. The estimated heterogeneity patterns are found to be generally reproducible in spite of uncertainties. In addition, the estimates from each year are capable of predicting the observed drawdowns, induced by independent pumping tests during the corresponding year (i.e., self-validation). Moreover, the estimated fields are cross-validated. That is, this study uses the estimates obtained from the 2010 pumping tests to predict the observed drawdowns of the independent pumping tests conducted in 2012. Likewise, it uses the estimates from 2012 pumping tests to forecast the drawdowns of the independent pumping tests of 2010. The results of both self-validation and cross-validation indicate that the estimated T and S fields based on the test in one year can be used to predict bulk flow behavior in the other year. Differences in detailed behaviors may be attributed to changes in the processes, omitted in the depth-averaged flow model.

AB The hydrometeorological information is shown in the form of intensity, duration and period of return of extreme rains, in order to characterize the pluviometric regime in Haiti. Using information from health services in Haiti a Meteo-Epidemiological Vulnerability Index (MEVI) is proposed. This index uses infectious-contagious disease data, the capacity and distribution of medical infrastructure, physiographic conditions of the country, and rainfall data (expressed in intensities, durations and frequency). The results show how mortality and morbidity rates are influenced mainly by communicable diseases in different risk areas. It is concluded that the territorial vulnerability exposed to hydrometeorological phenomena increases in the West and South Departments, where there is a high prevalence of diseases that exceeds the capacity of medical attention. With these results, two resilience indexes are proposed. A theoretical index (TRF) based on the conditions of the region, taking into account vulnerability (V), MEVI, resistance (RT) and homeostasis (HO). And another index of resilience measured in situ (RF). The comparison of both indices allows us to know the future capacity of the region to face the activities of resilience.

AB Flood risk mapping and modeling is important to prevent urban flood damage. In this study, a flood risk map was produced with limited hydrological and hydraulic data using two state-of-the-art machine learning models: Genetic Algorithm Rule-Set Production (GARP) and Quick Unbiased Efficient Statistical Tree (QUEST). The flood conditioning factors used in modeling were: precipitation, slope, curve number, distance to river, distance to channel, depth to groundwater, land use, and elevation. Based on available reports and field surveys for Sari city (Iran), 113 points were identified as flooded areas (with each flooded zone assigned a value of 1). Different conditioning factors, including urban density, quality of buildings, age of buildings, population density, and socio-economic conditions, were taken into account to analyze flood vulnerability. In addition, the weight of these conditioning factors was determined based on expert knowledge and Fuzzy Analytical Network Process (FANP). An urban flood risk map was then produced using flood hazard and flood vulnerability maps. The area under the receiver-operator characteristic curve (AUC-ROC) and Kappa statistic were applied to evaluate model performance. The results demonstrated that the GARP model (AUC-ROC = 93.5%, Kappa = 0.86) had higher performance accuracy than the QUEST model (AUC-ROC = 89.2%, Kappa = 0.79). The results also indicated that distance to channel, land use, and elevation played major roles in flood hazard determination, whereas population density, quality of buildings, and urban density were the most important factors in terms of vulnerability. These findings demonstrate that machine learning models can help in flood risk mapping, especially in areas where detailed hydraulic and hydrological data are not available.

AB The objective of this study was to advance a new method to dynamically analyze the water environmental capacity (WEC) of non-point source (NPS) pollution. A Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model and differential evolution (DE) algorithm were coupled to automatically provide a calculation of the WEC in a daily step. The results showed that the largest ideal WECs occurred in the wet season with values up to 4500 t and 80 t for total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP), respectively. The ideal WEC had a positive correlation with the rainfall intensity, while the opposite was true for actual WEC. The smallest value of actual WEC for TN was -150 tin June, and a negative value also occurred in June for TP. This is because NPS pollution discharge was more sensitive to rainfall and flow change than the ideal WEC. Compared to phosphorus, the WEC of nitrogen was more affected by the hydrological and NPS pollution discharge conditions. In addition, the WEC of nitrogen and phosphorus in organic species was more affected by seasonal change than that of nitrogen and phosphorus in inorganic species. Spatially, the channels in the middle and southeast of the study area had the smallest actual WEC and even negative values were observed. The results of remnant WEC showed that the smallest value occurred in July and June with values of - 800 t and -140 t for TN and TP, respectively. Thus, significant attention should be paid to controlling NPS pollution during the wet season, and organic nitrogen and phosphorus should be set as the priority pollutants to control. Furthermore, controlling the NPS pollution discharge and enhancing the WEC should be carried out simultaneously. Compared to previously used methods, the calculation method employed in this study had the ability to simulate the transformation and interaction between nitrogen and phosphorus in organic and inorganic species, and better considered dynamic changes in the input conditions.

AB The Uluova basin aquifer system (UBAS), comprised of fractured/karstic rock and multilayer basin-fill aquifers, provides water for both domestic and agricultural needs in the Elazig province (Eastern Turkey). Although, the UBAS has been subject of large-scale hydrological modifications and controversial water management practices since late 1950s, thus far no studies have examined basinwide implications of such human perturbations in an integrated manner. In this study, GIS, geostatistics, R-mode factor analysis (R-mFA) and geochemical modeling techniques were employed to unravel the factors controlling the distribution and sources of arsenic (As) and selected potentially toxic elements (PTEs) in the stream sediment-soil and groundwater-surface water systems of the UBAS. As revealed by the results from R-mFA, three geogenic factors (Fl: Clay minerals and Fe-Mn oxyhydroxides, F2: Weathering of parent materials, and F3: Sulfide oxidation in mineralized zones) govern the geochemical dynamics of the PTEs in the stream sediment/soil media. In stream sediment and soil samples, especially Ni, Cr, and Co presented significant enrichment relative to upper continental crust average composition, whereas As contents were relatively low, varying from 0.3 to 13 mg kg(-1). Factors extracted from the combined water dataset (Fl: Groundwater salinization and arsenic mobilization, F2: Clay minerals and Fe-Mn oxyhydroxides, F3: pH and redox conditions, and F4: Aquifer oxygenation and nitrate contamination) accounted for 72.59% of the total variance. Water-rock interaction (e.g. sulfide oxidation, carbonate dissolution, silicate hydrolysis, adsorption-desorption, ion exchange, and evaporite dissolution), dilution/mixing with fresh/saline water components, evapoconcentration, and human induced perturbations causing internal salinization and oxygenation of the UBAS were the key mechanisms controlling the chemistry of waters and mobilization of As. In the UBAS, majority of As-rich water samples are confined to central-northem half of the basin and typically display high levels of dissolved O-2, inorganic oxyanions (HCO3, SO42- and of Si, B, Mo, Sb and V) and alkaline pH. Oxidation of sulfides (e.g. pyrite and arsenopyrite) found within the highly fractured Elazig magmatics in the upland areas at north and subsequent competitive adsorption-desorption processes occurring under alkaline, oxidizing and high ionic strength aquifer conditions along the downgradient groundwater flow path play a pivotal role in the As-enrichment in the UBAS. As concentrations ranged between 0.02 and 367.2 mu g L-1 in groundwater, 0.13-4842 mu g L-1 in spring water, and 0.04-31.1 mu g L-1 in the stream water samples, of which 20.83% exceeded the WHO provisional guideline value. In the water samples, As occurs mainly as As(V) species (HAsO42- and H2AsO4), indicated by the Eh-pH diagram and speciation calculations. The results of this study have shown that As enrichment in the UBAS can be attributed to both geogenic processes and anthropogenic activities that have modified the basin hydrology/hydrochemistry.

AB The goal of this study is to analyze fluid geochemistry, boron isotope and gas data to reassess the formation and evolution processes of the Changbaishan volcanic geothermal system (Jilin, China). Due to the presence of hot fumaroles (with temperatures of higher than 100 degrees C) and sinters, we believe that phase separation is occurring underground, which is also indicated by the characteristics of the B and gas data. Based on their hydrochemical data and B/Cl ratios, the thermal water samples in this area can be divided into three groups: 1) group 1 is steamheated/condensate water (group 1-1: JJ, JLQ; group 1-2: SBDG, XRQ); 2) group 2 is karst water (CR3 and LSD); and 3) group 3 is residual water (CR1 and CR2). The preliminary discrimination of samples using B and gas data implies that group 1-1 around the crater is controlled by a second phase separation process, which is induced by the input of hot magmatic material; group 1.2 in the basin area is controlled by the transformation of clay minerals, and the XRQ water sample shows contamination by sewage; group 2 represents karst water that has leached metamorphic rock and been directly heated by the input of hot magmatic volatiles; and group 3 is the result of one seawater phase separation process. The mixing and fluid-rock interaction models based on the mass balance of boron concentration and isotope imply that the phase separation and input of magmatic volatiles are more important than fluid-rock interactions in the formation of the Changbaishan geothermal system, and the first phase separation process in the deep carbonate reservoir occurred in a late stage, with approximately 75%-87.5% of water becoming vapor. Additionally, the Rayleigh distillation of B isotope implies that new magma is being generated below this area, with the low B concentrations and high boron isotopic values of its gases implying that the mixed component may be derived from the subducted Pacific plate (e.g., marine sediment). The addition of "excess heat" due to the continued subduction of the Pacific plate has further encouraged the phase separation process, and the subduction process has also accelerated the transition of the hydrothermal system into a non-hydrothermal system.

AB Lake Urmia-a shallow endemic hypersaline lake in northwest Iran-has undergone a dramatic decline in its water level (WL), by about 8 m, since 1995. The primary cause of the WL decline in Lake Urmia has been debated in the scientific literature, regarding whether it has been predominantly driven by atmospheric climate change or by human activities in the watershed landscape. Using available climate, hydrological, and vegetation data for the period 1981-2015, this study analyzes and aims to explain the lake desiccation based on other observed hydro-climatic and vegetation changes in the Lake Urmia watershed and classical exploratory statistical methods. The analysis accounts for the relationships between atmospheric climate change (precipitation P, temperature T), and hydrological (soil moisture SM, and WL) and vegetation cover (VC; including agricultural crops and other vegetation) changes in the landscape. Results show that P, T, and SM changes cannot explain the sharp decline in lake WL since 2000. Instead, the agricultural increase of VC in the watershed correlates well with the lake WL change, indicating this human-driven VC and associated irrigation expansion as the dominant human driver of the Lake Urmia desiccation. Specifically, the greater transpiration from the expanded and increasingly irrigated agricultural crops implies increased total evapotranspiration and associated consumptive use of water (inherently related to the irrigation and water diversion and storage developments in the watershed). Thereby the runoff from the watershed into the lake has decreased, and the remaining smaller inflow to the lake has been insufficient for keeping up the previous lake WL, causing the observed WL drop to current conditions.

AB The middle and down streams of Han River are complex river systems influenced by hydrologic variations, population distributions, and the engineering projects. The Middle Route of China's South-to-North Water Transfer (MSNW) project planned to transfer 95 billion m(3) annually from Han River to north China. The operation of the MSNW project may alter the flow rate and further influence the water quality of Han River. This study used min/max autocorrelation factor analysis (MAFA) and dynamic factor analysis (DFA) to analyze spatio-temporal variations of the water quality variables in three typical tributary-mainstream intersection zones in Han River from June 2014 to April 2017. MAFA results showed that chlorophyll-a (Chl-a), chemical oxygen demand (COD), suspend solid (SS) and phosphate (PO43-) (represented as trophic dynamics) are main concerned water quality variables in densely populated zones (Zones 1 and 3), and total nitrogen (TN), nitrate nitrogen (NO3-), COD, and PO43- (regarded as nutrient formations dynamics) represent the underlying water quality variations in agricultural cultivation zone (Zone 2). DFA results indicated that domestic and municipal effluent pollutants influence the organic concentrations and nutrient formations in the mainstream in Zones 1 and 2. The non-point source nitrogen and phosphorus discharged from the tributaries Tangbai and Hanbei Rivers elevate the nutrient concentrations and increase Chl-a concentration (i.e. promote the algal growth) in densely populated zones. In addition, controlling the flow rates in low and middle flow rate conditions can avoid degrading water quality. The flow rate should be elevated to more than 700 cm (cubic meters per second) in the middle stream and to more than 800 cm in the downstream of Han River for preventing water quality deterioration from high loadings of organic pollutants and nutrients. The integrated MAFA and DFA method establishes an efficient analysis distinguishing spatio-temporal variation of water quality variables and provides useful site-specific management to control water quality in various flow conditions.

AB Green roofs, in contrast to conventional roofs, retain significant stormwater, and are considerably appealing for urban regions to help mitigate flooding events and addressing serious environmental impacts of excessive or uncontrolled runoff. In designing a green roof, a careful selection of substrate material/depths, vegetation or slopes, or its optimal combination, is imperative but this issue remains underexplored by practicing hydrologists. Scale-based models of extensive green roofs were purposely designed and simulated rainfall experiments were conducted to comprehensively quantify runoff retention performance of extensive green roofs, to precisely determine the contribution of structural factors to stormwater retention. The results indicated that green roofs can effectively retain stormwater and delay the start of the runoff. To aver with this finding, influential contribution of four structural factors are ordered as follows: substrate material > substrate depth > slope > vegetation. This finding denotes that substrate material and its depth are major contributors to a green roof's stormwater retention capability. Statistical tests conducted on runoff retention showed the substrate materials and vegetation types had statistically significant effects, no statistically significant difference in runoff retention abilities among the three substrate depth treatments and the slope gradients considered. Given the same conditions, the study ascertains that runoff retention of low intensity events is likely to be relatively higher, while that of the heavy events is lower than its counterparts. The antecedent moisture contents of the substrate have a significant negative influence on the runoff retention and the time to the runoff.

AB Climate-stressed groundwater resources present a growing challenge for protecting food security and economic sustainability, notably in Small Island Developing States (SIDS). These states are some of the most vulnerable to climate stress because of their large coastlines, vulnerability to rising sea levels, weak access to reliable surface water, and limited food production capacity for handling increased groundwater scarcity. Impacts of climate stressed groundwater resources brought on by irrigation and growing urban demand in SIDS continue to receive widespread attention by both scientists and policymakers. Policies that limit pumping to protect aquifer sustainability reduce short-term economic welfare by unknown amounts that would otherwise be secured by both urban and irrigation water users. Yet, little scholarly research has addressed economic impacts of climate-water stress for the special needs of SIDS for which urban and irrigation pumping compete hydrologically and economically over long time periods. The original contribution of this work is to address that gap by employing downscaled data on precipitation from Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP) climate scenarios. Its novel contribution is to conceptualize, develop, apply, and interpret an integrated hydro-economic framework to understand interconnected physical and economic linkages from managing an unconfined regional aquifer system under each of three climate and two policy scenarios. The application is to Barbados, a SIDS, for which current and future irrigation and urban demands compete for water. The framework integrates groundwater hydrology, climate scenarios, economics, land use, and groundwater management, with the intent to mitigate impacts of climate stress on current economic values of water as well as protecting future aquifer sustainability. Results provide a framework to guide water management for SIDS vulnerable to climate stress for which water of the right quantity, quality, timing, location, and price are essential elements of economic development.

AB A general analytical procedure based on phase averaged formulation is presented in this work to investigate environmental dispersion in layered wetland. Based on concentration moments, Chatwin's long-time asymptotic technique is applied to describe both the longitudinal distribution of the depth-averaged concentration and the two-dimensional concentration field, including their longitudinal non-Gaussian effects of skewness and Kurtosis. Three wetlands of equal depth-averaged porosity but with different number of layers are studied to illustrate the impact of layered structure on solute transport. The layered structure of wetlands leads to great changes in velocity profiles and evolution of environmental dispersivity, skewness and kurtosis of depth-averaged concentration distribution. In each layer, vertical distribution of concentration is highly nonuniform in the initial stage of transport. Layers with different porosity result in essential difference between layer-averaged concentrations, of which all tend to be normally distributed.

AB Drought is a complex natural hazard with its adverse multifaceted impacts cascading in every physical and human system. The vulnerability magnitude of various areas to drought mostly depends on their exposure to water deficiency, the existing water management policy framework and its implementation. The Standardized Drought Vulnerability Index (SDVI) is an integrated attempt towards characterizing drought vulnerability based on a comparative classification system, incorporating precipitation patterns, the supply and demand trends, and the socioeconomic background as the most crucial contributors to drought vulnerability. This work attempts to evolve the SDVI by presenting a more rigorous method of index parameters estimation and argues that the combination of in-situ and satellite data improve the index results in an effort to further minimize the paucity of drought related information. At the same time, it helps to surpass previous limitations in temporal and spatial propagation of the vulnerability concept. The new framework is applied in the South Platte Basin, within Colorado, on the 2012 summer drought (July-September). The proposed index modification may convey drought information in a more holistic manner to decision makers. SDVI could aid in advancing the understanding of each component contribution through in situ and remote sensing data integration and in avoiding existing practices of broken linkages and fragmentation of the reported impacts. Thus, it is believed that the SDVI could serve as an additional tool to guide decisions and target mitigation and adaptation actions, allowing for a more integrated management approach.

AB Oscillatory pumping tests consist of injecting periodic discharge into an aquifer and measuring head response along vertical piezometers surrounding the well. The aim is to identify the specific storativity s and conductivity K of the aquifer, which are generally spatially variable. Recently, an analytical solution for oscillating head in a homogeneous formation was derived and applied to the Boise aquifer test site (Rabinovich et al., 2015). Equivalent properties S-eq, K-eq were identified by best fit of the computed and measured heads. Here, this approach is generalized for heterogeneous aquifers of spatially variable logconductivity (Y = InK), which is modeled as a stationary space random function characterized by K-G (geometric mean), sigma(2)(Y) (variance), I and I-nu (horizontal and vertical integral scales). Semi-analytical solutions are obtained for the mean head amplitude (<vertical bar H vertical bar >) and phase by a first order approximation in sigma(2)(Y). Application to a given realization requires a large ratio between the well length and I-nu, as well as availability of a large number of measurements (ergodicity). We define a correction term, psi representing the impact of heterogeneity on < H >. Investigating the dependence of psi upon the distance from the pumping well reveals the existence of a few regimes, namely a near well region in which it is independent of period and far away, where the solution pertains to a homogeneous aquifer of effective properties. The solution is applied to the Boise aquifer test by a best fit of <vertical bar H vertical bar > with the measured head in 3 piezometers, for a given value of sigma(2)(Y) = 0.5. In spite of the departure from ergodicity, the identification of K-G is quite robust and in agreement with previous tests while that of I is subject to uncertainty. An additional method for improving the identification of K by conditioning on measured point-wise head (co-kriging) is also outlined.

AB Most water conservation policies will target agriculture, the largest human consumptive use and that concentrating the marginal (i.e. least productive) uses of the resource. Adaptation to irrigation rationing policies at the micro level will have an impact on agricultural outputs and propagate to the rest of the economic sectors at a regional and supra-regional (macro) scale. As the economy transitions towards new equilibrium commodity prices, the relevant prices for agriculture will change and this will in turn affect irrigators' decisions. This paper proposes an iterative coupling between a decentralized, non-parametric Positive Multi-Attribute Utility Programming representation of irrigators and a regionally-calibrated Computable General Equilibrium model to assess interlinkages (i.e. two-way feedbacks) between the micro- and macro-economy. Results from an application to irrigation water charges in the Murcia Region in Spain show that the coupled micro-macro model yields lower abatement costs as compared to the stand-alone micro model.

AB Hydrogeological conceptual models are collections of hypotheses describing the understanding of groundwater systems and they are considered one of the major sources of uncertainty in groundwater flow and transport modelling. A common method for characterizing the conceptual uncertainty is the multi-model approach, where alternative plausible conceptual models are developed and evaluated. This review aims to give an overview of how multiple alternative models have been developed, tested and used for predictions in the multi-model approach in international literature and to identify the remaining challenges.
   The review shows that only a few guidelines for developing the multiple conceptual models exist, and these are rarely followed. The challenge of generating a mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive range of plausible models is yet to be solved. Regarding conceptual model testing, the reviewed studies show that a challenge remains in finding data that is both suitable to discriminate between conceptual models and relevant to the model objective.
   We argue that there is a need for a systematic approach to conceptual model building where all aspects of conceptualization relevant to the study objective are covered. For each conceptual issue identified, alternative models representing hypotheses that are mutually exclusive should be defined. Using a systematic, hypothesis based approach increases the transparency in the modelling workflow and therefore the confidence in the final model predictions, while also anticipating conceptual surprises. While the focus of this review is on hydro geological applications, the concepts and challenges concerning model building and testing are applicable to spatio-temporal dynamical environmental systems models in general.

AB Until now, limited attention has been afforded to the role of, and challenges faced by, women involved in water diplomacy. In addition to research being at an early stage, it is mainly focused on addressing the challenges imposed by gender inequality. Thus very few applicable policy recommendations have emerged in this field to date.
   This paper will explore and identify current challenges that face the women interested in attaining high level positions in water diplomacy, in three Arab countries in which hydropolitics prevails, including Jordan, Lebanon and the State of Palestine. Female experts working on water-related issues were surveyed and interviewed to ascertain key qualitative issues, perceptions and various challenges. The focus of the paper was to identify the additional skills to be developed and acquired, for these women to better qualify as water diplomats both nationally and globally. In addition, the paper explores how to better equip women as leaders in the attainment of the Sustainable Development Goals, especially Goal 5 on Gender Equality and Goal 6 on Clean Water and Sanitation, in their national water sectors. The results provide a basic and initial mapping of current challenges and makes recommendations that would assist in the empowerment of those women in water diplomacy decision making positions in the regions investigated specifically, as well as globally.

AB Water and energy are considered as the two most important resources for human life and development, and can be represented by the nexus for the cross-sectional connection including water supply, wastewater treatment and hydropower generation sectors in a cascade reservoir system. In order to quantify interactions of the nexus, a novel diagram according to water and energy flow in every sector was proposed in this paper. And an optimal water-energy nexus model was also developed for the efficiently and effectively cross-sectoral coordinating the diagram based on the water and energy flow conceptual network. According to our case study in the middlelower Lancangjiang River basin, the nexus varies with the external water demand, water inflow conditions, instream ecological water demand constraints and the requirements of the electronic grid in the system. Moreover, the objective preferred by the decision maker only slightly influences the nexus results. The proposed approaches including the water-energy nexus diagram and its optimisation model are easily implemented and clearly visually illustrate the process of water and energy flow for every sector. The results of our optimal nexus configuration in the case study not only demonstrate the sensitivity of the parameters and input variables, but can also improve the understanding of the gap between current and optimal situations.

AB Climatic warming has resulted in permafrost degradation and it is expected to alter the hydrological processes and hydraulic connectivity on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP). Some important and pending issues for understanding the hydrological processes in permafrost regions are how much melting water from thawing permafrost can feed the stream water and how the hydraulic connectivities will be altered under continual permafrost degradation. In this study, the Source Area of the Yellow River locating on the Northeast QTP was studied by using stable isotopic method and field hydrological observation. Results exhibited significant seasonal hydrological variations of stream water, thermokarst lakes, and ground ice. Hydrograph separation suggested that precipitation is the main contributor to stream water in ice-free months, accounting for 53.5% and 52.2% of the streams on average for the two branches, respectively. The second source is springs, which contributed about 29.8% and 17.9%. However, the recharge from melting ice is also important; it exported an average of 16.7% and 13.2% to the surface stream. Conceptual model and stable isotopes emphasized the remarkable hydraulic connectivities between the precipitation, stream water, thermokarst lakes, spring, and the near-surface ground ice. Current findings provide a basic understanding of the log-term hydrological processes under permafrost degradation, and can offer an efficient way to assess future hydrological changes and water resource protection.

AB The Indian Ocean which is home to many islands and the low-lying coastal zones have attracted considerable attention due to regional sea level changes. In this study, we examine regional changes in sea level of the Indian Ocean and potential coastal flooding impacts by using tide gauge data. Various interpolation methods are evaluated to predict values at locations where data is unavailable. Based on the cross-validation analysis, the radial basis function is identified as the most optimal interpolation method and is used to analyze the spatial patterns of sea level changes. The analysis reveals that Bangladesh, Seychelles, and Cocos (Keeling) Islands have relatively high rates of sea level rise. These regions would thus be highly vulnerable to coastal flooding induced by the accelerating sea level rise in future decades, posing significant threats to coastal communities and ecosystems. Flooding impacts are examined through inundation mapping in a geographic information system (GIS) environment. In addition, relationships between regional factors (sea surface temperature, air temperature, and vertical land motions) affecting sea level rise are investigated. Our findings indicate that vertical land motion is an important factor affecting sea level changes for the regions of Seychelles and Cocos Islands. There is a strong relationship between air temperature and sea level rise for all studied regions. This study is a first attempt to examine regional changes in sea level of the Indian Ocean and potential coastal flooding impacts by using tide gauge data. The methods used in this study can be applied to other coastal regions around the world.

AB Despite the massive diversity in the modeling requirements for practical hydrological applications, there remains a need to develop more reliable and intelligent expert systems used for real-time prediction purposes. The challenge in meeting the standards of an expert system is primarily due to the influence and behavior of hydrological processes that is driven by natural fluctuations over the physical scale, and the resulting variance in the underlying model input datasets. River flow forecasting is an imperative task for water resources operation and management, water demand assessments, irrigation and agriculture, early flood warning and hydropower generations. This paper aims to investigate the viability of the enhanced version of extreme learning machine (EELM) model in river flow forecasting applied in a tropical environment. Herein, we apply the complete orthogonal decomposition (COD) learning tool to tune the output-hidden layer of the ELM model's internal neuronal system, instead of the conventional multi-resolution tool (e.g., singular value decomposition). To demonstrate the application of EELM model, the Kelantan River, located in the Malaysian peninsular, selected as a case study. For a comparison of the EELM model, and further model evaluation, two distinct data-intelligent models are developed (i.e., the classical ELM and the support vector regression, SVR model). An exhaustive list of diagnostic indicators are used to evaluate the EELM model in respect to the benchmark algorithms, namely, SVR and ELM. The model performance indicators exhibit superior results for the EELM model relative to ELM and SVR models. In addition, the EELM model is presented as a more accurate, alternative predictive tool for modelling the tropical river flow patterns and its underlying characteristic perturbations in the physical space. Several statistical metrics defined as the coefficient of determination (r), Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (E-ns), Willmott's Index (WI), root-mean-square error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE) are computed to assess the model's effectiveness. In quantitative terms, superiority of EELM over ELM and SVR models was exhibited by E-ns = 0.7995, 0.7434 and 0.665, r = 0.894, 0.869 and 0.818 and WI = 0.9380, 0.9180 and 0.8921, respectively. Whereas, EELM model attained lower (RMSE and MAE) values by approximately (11.61-22.53%) and (8.26-8.72%) relative to ELM and SVR models, respectively. The obtained results reveal that the EELM model is a robust expert model and can be embraced practically in real-life water resources management and river sustainability decisions. As a complementary component of this paper, we also review state-of-art research works where scholars have embraced extensive implementation of the ELM model in water resource engineering problems. A comprehensive evaluation is carried out to recognize the current limitations, and also to propose potential opportunities of applying improved variants of the ELM model presented as a future research direction.

AB The 2003-2013 monthly groundwater storage (GWS) anomalies in the highly karstic region (HKR) and low karstic region (LKR) in the Southwest China are estimated from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) terrestrial water storage (TWS) data by using the ancillary data of surface water storage (SWS) and soil moisture storage (SMS) from the WaterGAP model simulations. The leakage errors in the estimated GWS anomalies are corrected through using the iterative forward modelling approach. The estimated GWS anomalies compare well with in situ groundwater-level observations with the correlation coefficient r = 0.71 and the rootmean-square-error (RMSE) = 42 mm. For both HKR and LKR, similar to 60% of temporal variability of TWS is contributed by GWS variability, while SMS contributes to 18% (HKR) and 28% (LKR), and SWS contributes to 22% (HKR) and 14% (LKR) of the TWS variability. Due to the higher permeability of the epi-karst zones and their better connection with the subsurface aquifers, GWS anomalies in HKR show larger correlations with SWS (r = 0.73, RMSE = 51 mm) and SMS (r = 0.68, RMSE = 47 mm) and a shorter lag to precipitation than that in LKR (SWS: r = 0.56, RMSE = 50 mm, and SMS: r = 0.48, RMSE = 49 mm). During the extreme drought in 2009, GWS loss in HKR (LKR) was 74.3 mm/yr (42.7 mm/yr), accounting for 66% (62%) of total TWS loss. The severe GWS loss was mainly due to larger discharges through the well-developed subsurface drainage system rather than human depletion, since groundwater resources are still under-exploited in Southwest China ( similar to 4 km(3)/yr, 12% of the potentially exploitable amounts). A quicker recovery of GWS from 2009 drought can be observed in HKR than LKR due to the larger and earlier (approximately one month) precipitation and infiltration, and quicker response of groundwater to precipitation in HKR.

AB The hydrogen and oxygen isotope composition of precipitation and water vapor are useful tracers in the water cycle. The water balance of inland river basins located in the monsoon marginal zone are difficult to determine, because little is known about the contribution of various vapor involved. Based on the three-component isotopic mixing model, the monthly precipitation, surface water and plant water isotope data of the seven sampling stations from April to October 2017 were used to assess the vapor contribution to precipitation in the Shiyang River basin.
   The average contribution of plant transpiration, land surface evaporation and adverted vapor to precipitation accounted for 11%, 6% and 83% in the Mountain regions, for 21%, 7% and 72% in the Oasis regions, and for 10%, 5% and 85% in the Desert regions, respectively. The contribution of plant transpiration and surface evaporation vapor was similar in time variation, and the maximum value appeared in July. The average plant transpiration vapor contribution at each station was always greater than the surface evaporation vapor. Different landscape and special underlying surfaces are important factors influencing the difference in water vapor contribution. The average surface evaporation water vapor contribution of the Xiying (M1) station is the largest in the study area, with a contribution fraction of 9%. The contribution of Wuwei oasis recycled moisture can reach 30%, the plant transpiration vapor accounted for 73%.

TI Impacts of the hydropower-controlled Tana-Beles interbasin water
   transfer on downstream rural livelihoods (northwest Ethiopia)
SO JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY

ID LAKE TANA; DAMS; BASIN; NILE
AB Despite public awareness of unintended impacts (1980s) and well-developed international standards (2000s), downstream impacts of large hydropower projects still very often are not properly assessed. Impacts of (hydropower-regulated) interbasin water transfers (IBWTs) are considered self-evidently positive, although they can have far-reaching consequences for hydrogeomorphological systems and consequently river-dependent communities. In this study, the downstream direct and indirect impacts of the Ethiopian hydropower-regulated Tana-Beles IBWT are evaluated in an interdisciplinary way. The components of the framework of rural livelihoods are considered and changing contexts, resources' availabilities and livelihood strategies are analysed. Mixed methods are applied, combining hydrogeomorphological field observations, GIS analyses, scientific literature, policy documents, and semi-structured interviews with local people and local to federal authorities. Results show that the IBWT drastically increased the Beles river's discharge (with an average release of + 92 m(3) s(-1 )at the outlet; *2 in rainy season and *12 in dry season 100km downstream of the water release) and introduced dangerous situations for local communities (over 250 people drowned in the river). River bank erosion resulted in the uncompensated loss of farmland (163 ha) and the establishment of large-scale commercial farms increased the pressure on land and led to the impoverishment of displaced communities (4310 households). The project was implemented top-down, without any transparency, benefit sharing or compensation for external costs. This stresses the importance of downstream interdisciplinary impact assessments and highlights the need for decent in-depth ex post-analyses of hydropower projects. Environmental impact assessments should be taken seriously and cannot be considered a formality. In Ethiopia and in many developing countries, the hydropower industry is booming. Although dams and IBWTs can be the best solution for water-related problems in specific contexts, national development goals (such as the expansion of the electricity network) should not be at the expense of rural livelihoods.

AB The cosmic-ray neutron probe (CRNP) is a new tool for continuously monitoring mean soil-water content (SWC) on a hectometer scale, but the performance of CRNPs in highly heterogeneous distributions of SWC, vegetation and especially soil texture caused by the broken surface on the Loess Plateau in China remains uncertain. The study evaluated the application and accuracy of the method for three soil textures in a small watershed on the plateau to provide a reference and scientific basis for its application. Three CRNPs were installed in a loamy sand hills (LSH) plot, a silty loam dam (SLD) plot, and a sandy loam slope (SLS) plot, soil moisture sensors were buried at various depths in three plots. The footprints of the CRNPs for SWC observation had radii of 127-170, 126-174 and 148-174 m in SLD, SLS and LSH, respectively, and the mean measuring depth was about 20 cm for SLD and SLS and 40 cm for LSH based on general calculation equations. The accuracy of the CRNP method was high when validated using oven-dried method (RMSE = 0.068 cm(3) cm(-3)). The mean SWCs estimated from the other types of sensors were consistent with the mean SWCs from the CRNP probes in the three plots. The coefficient of determination of the linear relationship was in the order: SLS > LSH > SLD. The coefficient of variations (CV) were higher in LSH than SLD and SLS, indicating that SWC varied most in LSH. During periods of rain, the variations were larger for SLD than SLS and LSH, with a CV of 32.2%. The CRNP for SLD had the highest rates of change during periods with and without rain for both increasing and decreasing SWC, but this plot held more water than LSH and SLS, consistent with the high clay and organic-matter contents in SLD. The rates of change were significantly correlated with the antecedent SWCs (P < 0.01), and the higher the antecedent SWC, the faster the rate of change for each plot. This study verified the application of the CRNP for monitoring field-average SWC of the broken surface on the Loess Plateau and represents a new approach for the study of the spatial distribution of SWC on the plateau. CRNP can measure SWC of the complex underlying surface accurately, so as to provide a more reliable assessment of the impacts of landscapes and vegetation changes, such as conversion of cropland to forest and grassland on the Loess Plateau on water resources.

TI Role of agricultural activity on land subsidence in the San Joaquin

SO JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
LA English
DT Article
DE Agriculture activity; Central valley; Subsidence; InSAR; Water supply;
   Groundwater wells
AB The center of the San Joaquin Valley is one of the most productive agricultural regions in the US. Farmers rely heavily on surface-water diversions to meet irrigation water demand. However, the 2007-2010 and 2012-2017 droughts have caused strong increases in groundwater pumping causing land subsidence with strong variability in location, magnitude (total subsidence) and rate of subsidence. In this study, we try to understand what caused these variations. We focus our analyses on three areas: (i) the Westland water district where subsidence was very small during the two drought periods, (ii) 'El Nido' area where the greatest subsidence rate was monitored from 2008 to 2010, and (iii) the' Kings-Tulare counties' area where the subsidence was small during the 2008-2010 and the largest during 2015-2017 droughts. Our main finding is that land subsidence is located in areas where the water demand for agriculture and the density of groundwater wells is the highest, whereas the rate of subsidence is strongly affected the amount of local and imported surface water and by groundwater resources. Based on these simple observations, we propose using continuous satellite-based ground deformation monitoring and geomechanical modeling to (i) localize areas most prone for future subsidence and (ii) to estimate and manage groundwater resources.

AB Subsidence and ground uplift are phenomena that may have natural or anthropogenic origin and cause strong socioeconomic and environmental impacts, especially in urban areas. In this paper, the coupling between ground uplift and groundwater rebound in a complex multi-layered aquifer system in the metropolitan city of Naples (southern Italy) has been investigated. By an integrated use of hydrogeological and DInSAR monitoring data covering the periods 1989-2013 and 1993-2010, respectively, the spatio-temporal evolution of natural ground deformation following the strong reduction and interruption of groundwater pumping has been analysed. Hydrogeological monitoring data have shown large-scale groundwater rebound, with the highest amplitude of approximately 16 m and a groundwater rising velocity up to approximately 1.0 m/yr. DInSAR data show a general ground uplift with a magnitude of approximately 40 mm on average, except for the southern sector of the study area where some local natural and human-induced subsidence has been identified. A comparison between trends of groundwater level and ground displacement indicates that the ground uplift is linked to a poro-elastic rebound mechanism in the porous aquifer system, which is triggered by the increase of pore pressure, while the rate of ground displacement is controlled by the hydrostratigraphic characteristics of the multilayered aquifer system. The results improve the knowledge of man-induced deformation in complex urban aquifers affected by groundwater rebound and highlight that the implementation of an appropriate hydro-mechanical deformation model is a necessary step to correctly model and manage a new geohazard in a highly urbanized environment.

AB Rivers and streams are important agents for global and regional carbon cycle, which represent a nonnegligible carbon source to the atmosphere. However, carbon dioxide (CO2) degassing via water-air interface from inland waters currently has a large uncertainty in estimation. Here we examined the CO2 partial pressure (pCO(2)) and CO2 degassing in the Daning River, a main tributary of the Yangtze in the Three Gorges Reservoir (TGR) region. The riverine pCO(2 )showed obvious spatial and temporal variations on the main stem and its tributaries, ranging from 483,2 +/- 293.9 mu atm (May) to 2183.3 +/- 1309.2 mu atm (August) with an average of 1198.2 +/- 1122.9 mu atm. pCO(2) increased with the intensive agricultural practices and population on the lower reach of the tributary. The daytime average water-air CO2 flux was 329.8 +/- 470.2 mmol/m(2)/d, and yielded a total CO2 efflux approximately 0.12 Tg CO2/y. The results also indicated that carbon loss via atmospheric exchange accounted for 38.8% of riverine dissolved carbon fluxes. There were close relations between pCO(2) and environmental parameters such as total dissolved nitrogen (TDN), total dissolved phosphorus (TDP) and water temperature in the rainy season, but not in the dry season. Our results demonstrated the essential need to highlight the importance of anthropogenic activities on global and regional CO2 outgassing, and it is urgent to underscore the detailed biogeochemical processes in riverine pCO(2), as well as the couplings between pCO(2) and environmental parameters.

AB An analytical model for describing pumping induced drawdown by constant-head test at a partially penetrating well in a leaky confined aquifer is developed by treating the leakage of aquitard storage as an interface phenomenon rather than an volumetric effect, which is the novel and never developed so far. Three different cases of remote lateral boundaries are considered in the model. The new drawdown solution in Laplace space is obtained and inverted into time-domain solution utilizing the Stehfest method. The (semi-)analytical solutions for well discharge are then obtained under three different cases. Analytical solutions in Laplace and time domains are developed for calculating the (total) leakage rate and volume across the aquitard-aquifer interface due to constant-head test at a partially penetrating well in a leaky confined aquifer, and such solutions are of great use for groundwater resource management. Based on the newly developed solutions, the distribution of wellbore flowrate and aquitard leakage are explored and the sensitivity analysis is conducted to identify the most important controlling factor. The sensitivity analysis shows that the wellbore flowrate and the drawdown in infinite (Case 1), finite (Case 2), and closed (Case 3) leaky confined aquifer systems are both sensitive to the variation of well partial penetration, well radius, and aquifer anisotropic ratio during the whole pumping period and they are most sensitive to the change of outer boundary distance at late time for Case 3. The effect of the outer boundary on the drawdown or wellbore flowrate is more significant for a shorter outer boundary distance.

AB Road construction associated with land development generally increases erosion and sediment yields. Construction of unpaved roads has the potential to alter hydro-sedimentological behavior and catchment sediment source dynamics and, to date, this has largely been investigated in forested environments. The objective of this study, therefore, was to assess the relative importance of unpaved recreational roads as a sediment source alongside hillslope surface soils and stream channel banks in a non-forested mountainous catchment in northern Tehran, Iran, using a fingerprinting procedure. Eleven geochemical tracers were measured on 27 samples collected to characterise the sediment sources and five suspended sediment samples collected at the study catchment outlet. The statistical analysis employed to select three different composite fingerprints for discriminating the sediment sources comprised: (1) the Kruskal-Wallis H test (KW-H), (2) a combination of KW-H and discriminant function analysis (DFA), and (3) a combination of KW-H and principal components & classification analysis (PCCA). A Bayesian un-mixing model was used to ascribe sediment source contributions using the three composite fingerprints. Using the KW-H composite signature, the respective relative contributions (with uncertainty ranges) from recreational roads, hillslope surface soils and channel banks were estimated as 64.5% (57.7-73.1), 1.1% (0.1-4.9), and 33.9% (24.9-41.0), compared to 55.3% (45.5-68.5), 1.9% (0.1-7.9) and 42.1% (27.8-52.4) using a composite signature selected using a combination of KW-H and DFA, or 82.0% (69.7-93.8), 8.2% (0.7-22.7) and 7.3% (0.7-21.0) using a fingerprint selected using KW-H and PCCA. The root mean square difference between the apportionment results using the fingerprints identified on the basis of the three different statistical approaches ranged from 5.5% to 25.7%, highlighting the sensitivity of source estimates to the tracers used. Regardless, the different composite signatures all suggested that unpaved recreational roads were the dominant source of the suspended sediment samples, underscoring the need for mitigation measures targeting these anthropogenic features of the catchment system, including closure to permit re-vegetation, surface ripping and/or mulching to improve infiltration or gravel re-surfacing to reduce exposure of bare surfaces to sediment mobilisation.

AB Lake Chad was once the sixth largest lake in the world, with a surface area of about 25,000 km(2) in the early 1960s. However, it has shrunk to almost only one-twentieth of its maximum area by now. As the biggest river of the Lake Chad basin, the Chari/Logone River contributes approximately 90% of Lake Chad's water input. Consequently, several previous studies have focused on the Chari/Logone River system to investigate the causes of Lake Chad's shrinkage. However, due to the lack of authoritative irrigation and natural runoff observations, it is usually difficult to explain the relative contribution of human activities and climate variability. In this paper, unlike the hydrological modeling approaches used in previous studies, a conceptual and statistical approach was presented to investigate discharge variations and the causes leading to such variations. Specifically, the runoff .change caused by climate variability (Delta Q(climate)) was estimated using Budyko analysis, while that caused by human activities (Delta Q(h)(uman)) was estimated using regression analysis. The accuracy of estimation was evaluated through cross validation and comparison with previous studies. The comparison suggests that due to the lack of natural runoff and irrigation withdrawal observations, the runoff simulation produced by previous hydrological models suffers from large errors. The water loss of the Chari/Logone River discharge is dominated by human activities rather than climate variability. On annual average scale, the total water loss caused by climate variability and anthropogenic activities is 16.76 km(3). The relative contribution of Delta Q(climate) and Delta Q(h)(uman) is 26.83% and 73.17%, respectively. The role of human activities is particularly obvious in recent ten years from 2003 to 2013. Due to the increase of rainfall and irrigation withdrawals, the relative contribution of human activities accounts for more than 80% of the total water loss.

AB Understanding soil water storage (SWS) dynamics in soil profiles is important for hydrological modeling and restoration of vegetation in semi-arid areas. Using the temporal stability method, we aimed to investigate the temporal stability of SWS at 0-40, 40-80, and 80-120 cm depth, and to identify representative sites for reliable estimates of the mean SWS in the permanent forest plot in the Qilian Mountains of China. Further, we wanted to identify correlations between temporal stability of SWS and soil, topography, and properties of the vegetation. Soil water content at soil depths 0-120 (for locations 1-40) and 0-70 cm (for locations 41-60) were measured using time-domain reflectometry (TDR) on 52 dates from 2016 to 2017.
   Results revealed that time-averaged mean SWS for the three layers differed significantly (P < 0.05), and the temporal changes and spatial variations of the mean SWS all decreased with increasing soil depth. Based on either the Spearman correlation coefficient or the standard deviation of relative difference (SDRD) index, the temporal stability of SWSs within the soil profiles under different soil layers were strong, and the number of time-stable locations increased with increasing soil depth, indicating that the SWS intended to be more temporally stable in deeper soil. One time-stable site can be representative of the mean SWS for multiple soil layers for the whole plot, and can accurately estimate the mean SWS for the three soil layers (R-2 > 0.86, P < 0.001). Moreover, these time-stable locations should be those having average LAI, SBD or relatively low canopy interception loss compared to the corresponding field means. Soil bulk density, canopy interception rate, and aboveground biomass of mosses can significantly (P < 0.05) affect the stability of SWSs in this high-elevation forests. Such effects, however, differed among the different soil layers due to different conditions of soil characteristics, distribution of root biomass, and freeze-thawing processes. These results suggest that the influence of vegetation properties of the temporal stability of SWS should attract more attention and that both the relative importance of and interactions among different determining factors is helpful for better understanding the mechanistic determinants of SWS temporal stability in these areas.

AB How does physical history of flood-related hazards affect individuals' perceptions? The present study represents a unique effort to understand perceptions of flood hazards in light of the geographic background. Situated in Alabama, the United States, the cities of Mobile and Huntsville display two different physical geographic contexts. Despite one being a coastal city (Mobile) and the other being an inland city, both are similarly vulnerable to flooding. We first present results of historical analyses of heavy precipitation in both cities and analysis of storm surge history in the city of Mobile. We then report results of both descriptive statistical and inferential statistical analyses based on a two-city residents' survey that was conducted in the spring of 2016. We find that residents in both cities are able to connect the particular natural hazard of flooding with their physical environments. Residents in both cities are influenced by their perceptions of precipitation when making assessments of flooding. Despite the fact that Huntsville has not experienced heavy precipitation events as much as Mobile in recent history, residents of Huntsville tend to link heavy rainfall - the most frequent cause of flooding in that city, with flooding. In contrast, residents of Mobile tend to link hurricanes, more particularly hurricane number, with flooding. These results show that people are attuned to their physical environments and take into consideration their personal observations when forming perceptions of natural hazards. More studies need to be conducted to further investigate the dynamics of physical exposure to hazards and risk perceptions in other geographic areas.

AB Fractured geological media are complex systems where hydrodynamic parameters are highly variable as result of their structure. Indeed, measured parameters depend on the scale and the implemented methodologies. with high variability of hydrodynamic parameters. This variableness also depends on the scale of measurement. Most theoretical frameworks assume homogeneous media adding uncertainty to the fractured media hydrogeological characterization. In fractured media, the complexity is even harder to characterize as available theoretical frameworks assume homogeneous media. Nevertheless, the increase of underground engineering projects and their reported impacts on surface and groundwater resources claim efforts to a better understanding of fractured media groundwater hydrodynamics. In this work, we propose a general approach for the scale-dependence of the hydraulic conductivity based on power law concepts. To do so, the hydraulic conductivity field of a highly fractured massif in the Colombian Andes is estimated over scales from 6 cm to 12 km. Laboratory measurements, re-analyzes of hydraulic tests, and calibration of 3D numerical models were performed, using the La Linea tunnels (in Colombia) as real scale laboratory. Hydraulic conductivity values vary up to four orders of magnitude at each characteristic length scale and show an increase until the local scale, followed by a small decrease at regional scale. In this way, field and regional scales display the same orders of magnitude. Finally, the scale-dependence of the hydraulic conductivity values based on power law concepts is proposed. As a consequence, it suggests the possibility to use field data in regional models, once hydrogeological units and structures are properly defined.

AB Complete hydrological time series are necessary for water resources management and modeling. This can be challenging in data scarce environments where data gaps are ubiquitous. In many applications, repetitive gaps can have unfortunate consequences including ineffective model calibration, unreliable timing of peak flows, and biased statistics. Here, Direct Sampling (DS) is used as a non-parametric stochastic method for infilling gaps in daily streamflow records. A thorough gap-filling framework including the selection of predictor stations and the optimization of the DS parameters is developed and applied to data collected in the Volta River basin, West Africa. Various synthetic missing data scenarios are developed to assess the performance of the method, followed by a real-case application to the existing gaps in the flow records. The contribution of this study includes the assessment of the method for different climatic zones and hydrological regimes and for different upstream-downstream relations among the gauging stations used for gap filling. Tested in various missing data conditions, the method allows a precise and reliable simulation of the missing data by using the data patterns available in other stations as predictor variables. The developed gap-filling framework is transferable to other hydrological applications, and it is promising for environmental modeling.

TI Modelling spring discharge and solute transport in conduits by coupling

AB Karst aquifers differ from unconsolidated granular aquifers with respect to their groundwater flow behavior because of the dual-permeability characteristics (discrete conduit network coupled to a fissured matrix), the duality of recharge (point vs. diffuse recharge) as well as the duality of flow (laminar vs. turbulent state). In many karst aquifers, the epikarst frequently plays an important role in redistributing precipitation as diffuse recharge into the fissured matrix and as point recharge into the conduit network as well as for the temporal distribution of recharge input. In this paper, a coupled groundwater model CE (CFPv2 + ERCH) is developed, consisting of a combination of a simple reservoir model generating the recharge source function assuming the concept of an epikarst horizon (ERCH) with CFPv2, a discrete conduit-continuum groundwater flow model of the phreatic karst aquifer. The CE model is applied to simulate spring discharge and a tracer breakthrough in a karst aquifer near Guilin City in southwest China. In order to examine the effect of an added epikarst reservoir model, simulations are carried out with CFPv2 but without including ERCH. Simulation results of both, spring hydro-graph and tracer breakthrough, indicate that CFPv2 with ERCH performs much better. A sensitivity analysis of the CE reveals the relative importance of parameters characterizing the epikarst reservoir. Point recharge is a main factor determining the large variation in spring discharge and its proportion to total recharge can reach 58%. These simulation results highlight the importance of the temporal and spatial distribution of recharge to karst spring discharge response. The coupled model provides an effective approach to include the effect of an epikarst zone in CFPv2 and it can easily be applied for the simulation of karst aquifers with similar characteristics as the study site.

AB The arid and semi-arid regions of the world are facing limited freshwater resources, minimal amounts of rainfall, and increasing population pressure and water demands. These resources, often groundwater, are vulnerable to both natural variability and anthropogenic interventions. Here, we develop and apply an integrated approach using geophysical, geochemical, and remote sensing observations to quantify the recharge rates of arid region aquifers that are witnessing rapid groundwater depletion. Focusing on the Saq aquifer system in the Arabian Peninsula, our study was three-fold: (1) to examine the areal extent of aquifer recharge domains using geologic, climatic, and remote sensing data; (2) to investigate the origin of, and modem contributions to, the aquifer system by examining the isotopic composition of groundwater samples; and (3) to estimate the magnitude of modem recharge to the aquifer utilizing estimates from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) data and a continuous rainfall-runoff model, the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model. Isotopic examination of the groundwater from Saq revealed that deeper aquifers (fossil water) are more depleted compared to shallow reserves (alluvial aquifer; mixed waters). Analysis of GRACE-derived terrestrial and groundwater storage estimates indicates that the aquifer system received an annual recharge rate of 5.21 +/- 0.10 Km(3)/yr (11.85 +/- 0.22 mm/yr), equal to about half of the withdrawal rate from wells during the investigation period (2002-2016). Analysis of SWAT results indicates that, from 1998 to 2014, the investigated watersheds received an average annual precipitation of 19.20 km(3), of which approximately 51% is partitioned as potential recharge. The temporal variations in storage, depletion and recharge are related to the changes in regional groundwater extraction, rainfall, and extent of irrigated areas.

AB Precipitation and air temperature are key drivers of watershed models. Currently there are many open-access gridded precipitation and air temperature datasets at different spatial and temporal resolutions over global or quasi-global scale. Motivated by the scarcity and substantial temporal and spatial gaps in ground measurements in Africa, this study evaluated the performance of three open-access precipitation datasets (i.e. CHIRPS (Climate Hazards Group InfraRed Precipitation with Station data), TRMM (Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission) and CFSR (Climate Forecast System Reanalysis)) and one air temperature dataset (CFSR) in driving Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model in simulation of daily and monthly streamflow in the upper Gilgel Abay Basin, Ethiopia. The "best" available measurements of precipitation and air temperature from sparse gauge stations were also used to drive SWAT model and the results were compared with those using open-access datasets. After a comprehensive comparison of a total of eight model scenarios with different combinations of precipitation and air temperature inputs, we draw the following conclusions: (1) using measured precipitation from even sparse available stations consistently yielded better performance in streamflow simulation than using all three open-access precipitation datasets; (2) using CFSR air temperature yielded almost identical performance in streamflow simulation to using measured air temperature from gauge stations; (3) among the three open-access precipitation, overall CHIRPS yielded best performance. These results suggested that the CHIRPS precipitation available at high spatial resolution (0.05 degrees) together with CFSR air temperature can be a promising alternative open-access data source for streamflow simulation in this data-scarce area in the case of limited access to desirable gauge data.

AB Antecedent soil moisture is an important factor in the generation of runoff, but guidance for modeling moisture conditions in semiarid catchments is limited and conflicting. In this study, the impact of antecedent moisture was assessed at the plot scale (2.8 m(2)) using a portable rainfall simulator, and at the catchment scale based on observed precipitation and discharge for a 2.8 km(2) watershed in central New Mexico. Performance of three loss models commonly used for hydrologic analysis in the southwestern U.S. was tested at both scales. High initial moisture content led to substantially higher runoff ratios at both scales, confirming the importance of antecedent soil moisture for runoff predictions in semiarid drainages. Hydrologic parameters estimated based on plot experiments, however, were highly variable and cannot easily be upscaled to the catchment scale. Loss model performance was clearly scale dependent more simplistic (one- and two parameter) loss methods out-performed a more complex (four parameter) model at the watershed scale, while the opposite held true for test plot simulations. At the catchment scale, all models performed poorly for small runoff events, but yielded acceptable results for storms causing large discharges if antecedent soil moisture was considered. Failing to account for antecedent moisture led to simulated runoff volume errors up to one order of magnitude.

AB It is indispensable for the sustainable water supply of the human society to distribute the available water resources with maximal efficiency among the different consumers while assuring the needed time for recharge. The theoretically established, effective tool for the solution of this allocation problem is mathematical modelling with special regard to the methods of game theory.
   In the present paper, a differential game is proposed to describe the consumption and the (natural) recharge of a limited water resource. Then the general course of the solution of the allocation problem is given aiming at maximizing the players' yields through the discretization of the strategy sets. In case of two consumers, the solution is given in more details along with several practical examples. The Pareto optimality of the non-co-operative solution (Nash equilibrium) is checked and the Pareto optimal strategy pair, which provides maximal sum payoff for the players, is suggested for cooperation (after a possible re-distribution of the payoffs). This cooperative solution generally provides higher payoff for each player than if they consumed according to conflicting non-cooperative behaviour. In addition, examples with three consumers are provided similarly.

AB In coastal areas, flood events can result from the interaction of several factors such as rainfall, river flow and the classical tidal asymmetry to mention but a few. Therefore, flood risk assessment in these areas involves not only the estimation of the extreme values of each variable, but also their probability of occurring simultaneously. This study investigates the combined effect and dependence between a "heavy" rainfall with a high tidal levels forcing on the occurrence and severity of floods in the urban neighborhood close to the estuary of the Bouregreg River (Morocco). The methodology used for this analysis is based on a bivariate copula model to evaluate the joint risk probability of flood events. The estimated joint probability is used to define the boundary conditions for a hydraulic model to quantify the water levels and the extent of floods caused by the combination of both extreme rainfall and storm surge. The considered variables reveal a not negligible correlation, and the copula approach seems to be suitable and enough flexible, for analyzing separately marginal distributions of the source variables and their structure of dependence. Results show that the joint probability of rainfall and tide both exceeding their critical thresholds remains low to moderate, and the biggest threat to this area might be caused by heavy rainfall. However, high tide adds an extra risk by reducing the capacity of the urban drainage in absorbing storm water; especially when rainfall intensity exceeds 100 years return period. Although rainfall and tide introduce a wide range of time scale meteorological forcing, this won't prevent storm surge and extreme rainfall events resulting from climate change, to take place in the future, on the same day leading to some of the most critical flooding scenarios in this area.

AB Catchment-scale hydrological and hydrogeological investigations commonly conclude by finding that particular stream reaches are either gaining or losing; they also often assume that the influence of bedrock aquifers on catchment water balances and water quality is insignificant. However, in many cases, such broad findings are likely to oversimplify the spatial and temporal complexity of the connections between the different hydrological system components, particularly in regions dominated by cycles of droughts and flooding. From a modelling perspective, such oversimplifications can have serious implications on the process of identifying the magnitude and direction of the exchange fluxes between the surface and groundwater systems.
   In this study, we use 3D geological modelling and historic water chemistry and hydraulic records to identify the origins of groundwater at different locations in the alluvium and along the course of streams in the Lockyer Valley (Queensland, Australia), a catchment impacted by a severe drought ('Millennium Drought') from 1998 to 2009, followed by extensive flooding in 2011. We also demonstrate how discharge from the sub-alluvial regional-scale volcanic and sedimentary bedrock influences the water balance and water quality of the alluvium and streams. The investigation of aquifer geometry via development of a three-dimensional geological model combined with an assessment of hydraulic data provided important insights on groundwater flow paths and helped to identify areas where bedrock aquifers interact with shallow alluvial aquifers and streams. Multivariate statistical techniques were then applied as an additional line of evidence to groundwater and surface water hydrochemical data from large historical datasets. This confirmed that most sub-catchments within the Lockyer Valley have distinct water chemistry patterns, which result from mixing of different water sources, including discharge from the sub-alluvial bedrock. Importantly, in addition to the observed spatial variability, time-series hydrochemical groundwater and surface water data further demonstrated that the hydraulic connection between alluvial aquifers, streams and sub-alluvial bedrock aquifers is temporally dynamic with very significant changes occurring at the transition from normal to drought conditions and following flooding, affecting both catchment water quality and water balances.

AB To make an overall assessment of the groundwater quality in Seoul city, we used the self-organizing map (SOM) technique in combination with fuzzy c-means (FCM) clustering. SOM visualizes complicate and multidimensional data structures on a 2D surface while the FCM algorithm creates overlapping cluster boundaries among samples that are continuously distributed over a data space. The combination of SOM and FCM clustering was expected to help characterize highly complicated urban groundwater quality. As a result, the SOM characterized 343 groundwater samples using 91 neurons, which were further classified by FCM clustering into three water groups. Group 1 addressed the least polluted groundwater (17% of the samples (n = 58), average TDS = 194.5 mg/L and NO3 = 6.9 mg/L) and occurred in the peripheral areas whose land cover is mainly occupied by forests. Increasing pH with increasing sodium and bicarbonate concentrations indicated that the hydrogeochemistry of Group 1 was largely controlled by water-rock interactions. Group 2 included the highly polluted groundwater (24% of the samples (n = 82), average TDS = 326.2 mg/L and NO3 = 42.6 mg/L), and sporadically occurred in Seoul, with no distinct spatial control. This group seemed to be affected by sewage from broken sewer pipes, which are a primary pollution source of Seoul groundwater and are ubiquitously distributed beneath the city. Group 3 water also represented the highly contaminated groundwater (30% of the samples (n = 103), average TDS = 527.1 mg/L), but contained low nitrate concentrations (average NO3 = 13.1 mg/L). Based on their spatial locations, intensive groundwater pumping from subway tunnels and other underground spaces at the city center seemed to drive the induced flow of organic contaminants, resulting in local reducing conditions sufficient for denitrification. The remaining 100 samples (29% of the samples) shared the hydrogeochemical properties of two or three groups. This study successfully characterized the spatial pattern of urban groundwater quality that is complicated by various contamination sources and hydrogeochemical processes. The combined use of SOM and FCM clustering was proven as a powerful tool to interpret nonlinear and highly heterogeneous environmental data for which it is difficult to define cluster boundaries. Taken together, our results contribute to a better management of urban groundwater in metropolitan cities under high risks of anthropogenic contamination.

AB Climate change has the potential to exacerbate eutrophication and the risk of harmful algal blooms in lakes. Periodic adjustment of nutrient criteria, as the cornerstone of eutrophication control and water quality management, is expected to help mitigate the impact of climate change on harmful cyanobacterial blooms. The nutrient criteria that do not threaten the function of the water body determined with generalized additive models (GAMs) were 0.88 mg/L for total nitrogen (TN) and 0.021 mg/L for total phosphorus (TP) during the period of 1996-2005 based on 26 lakes and reservoirs in China. Climate change-induced temperature increases will substantially reduce the required nutrient criteria by 46.17% for TN and 15.24% for TP in lakes and reservoirs by the end of the century under the "business-as-usual" scenario. The results indicate that some lakes that currently meet the nutrient criteria could become dominated by cyanobacteria and experience blooms in a warmer future, even without increases in nutrient inputs. Therefore, as climate change persists, nutrient loads should be further reduced to achieve the desired water quality without the threat of eutrophication. Strict control of TP would be particularly advantageous to suppress algal blooms. It is imperative that water quality management strategies account for the impact of projected future climate changes on nutrient criteria and that nutrient criteria are periodically modified. The corresponding nutrient risk thresholds should be determined to ensure that lakes and reservoirs escape the threat of harmful algal blooms under the impact of extreme weather events.

AB This paper compares the hydrological responses at the local scale of two models using different degrees of refinement to represent physical processes in sparsely instrumented mountainous Himalayan catchments. This work presents the novelty of applying, at a small spatio-temporal scale and under the same forcing conditions, a fully distributed surface scheme based on mass and energy balance equations (ISBA surface scheme), and a semi-distributed calibrated model (J2000 hydrological model). A new conceptual module coupled to the ISBA surface scheme for flow routing is presented. Two small catchments located in mid- and high- mountain environments were chosen to represent the very different climatic and physiographic characteristics of the Central Himalayas in the Everest region of eastern Nepal. The results show that both models globally represent the dynamic of the processes for evaporation, quick runoff and discharge in a similar way. The differences in the model structures and results mainly concern the snow processes and the soil processes. In particular for the high-mountain catchment, the snow-pack simulation is shown to be the main driver of the discrepancy between the two models. The sub-daily variations of snow processes are shown to significantly influence the estimation of the snow-melt contribution to discharge.

AB The combination of remote sensing techniques and Geographic Information Systems (GIS) to measure water quality allows researchers to monitor changes in various water quality parameters over temporal and spatial scales that are not always readily apparent from in situ measurements. This study involves using Landsat images and in situ data within GIS to map urban expansion and its resulting influences on water quality in the Pontchartrain Basin over the last three decades. The Pontchartrain Basin is located in southeast Louisiana and covers an area of 25,000 km(2) that encompasses sixteen parishes east of the Mississippi River and four Mississippi Counties. A Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) image from 1985 and a Landsat Operational Land Imager (OLI) image from 2015 were processed using the Spectral Angle Mapper (SAM) algorithm to map urban expansion. In order to estimate how water quality has changed in the Pontchartrain Basin between 1985 and 2015, in situ water quality data from the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality was interpolated using Empirical Bayesian Kriging (EBK). Comparing urban expansion produced from SAM classification with urban indices, impervious surfaces were better identified and distinguished from other land cover features. The results of this study demonstrated that high levels of fecal coliform were consistent with increased urbanization in water bodies in the Pontchartrain Basin. Phosphorous levels were higher in 2015 compared to 1985 and were at levels high enough to lead to eutrophic conditions. Dissolved oxygen levels were lower near the mouth of the Mississippi river in 2015 than in 1985. The results indicated that urbanization has negative impact on water quality. The geospatial model is recommended to effectively manage and reduce the processing time of large water quality datasets.

AB In the Central Sudetes, the areas of sedimentary Permian and Carboniferous rocks are characterized by small resources of groundwater and are much less understood than aquifer systems occurring in the crystalline and Mesozoic sedimentary rocks. The environmental tracer studies conducted in a double sampling cycle during changing conditions of groundwater inflow can significantly facilitate the understanding of hydrogeological conditions in areas of the complicated geological structure. Therefore, in order to identify the hydrogeological conditions of study area, measurements of geogenic and anthropogenic gases (He, Ne, Ar, CFC-11, CFC-12 and SF6), determinations of isotopic composition of groundwater (delta O-18, delta H-2 and H-3) and the hydrogeochemical data (including selected REEs, thorium and uranium) were used. The research, which was conducted both in natural groundwater flow conditions and in conditions of flow disturbed by the continuous exploitation of the groundwater, enabled, among other things, a direct determination of the rate of maximum decomposition of CFC-11 and CFC-12 at depths of 50-450m in the elastic rocks. It ranges from 189 to 315.10(-12)g.L-1.yr(-1) for CFC-11 and from 110 to 198.10(-12)g.L-1.yr(-1) for CFC-12. The research conducted also indicates that in the study area the vertical or nearly vertical groundwater flow may have significance comparable to the lateral groundwater flow. This results in an intense mixing of groundwater which leads to the local occurrence of groundwater containing the ions and gases in concentrations characteristic of the deep aquifers in the studied area, with the simultaneous occurrence of ions and gases of anthropogenic origin. The results of measurements on CFCs, SF6 and noble gases indicate a significant inflow of young groundwater to the whole freshwater zone. An occurrence of a geogenic SF6 source, which is most probably associated with volcanic rocks, was also found. Calculated the groundwater ages indicate that the research area is dominated by groundwater of age less than 1 ka, and mainly in the range of 0.05-0.25 ka. The results of modeling of the influence of the variability of U and Th concentrations on the He in situ production within the aquifer (P-He) indicate, that for groundwater with He concentrations of 10(-6)-10(-8)cm(3) STP g(-1), i.e. modem groundwater, the He in situ production within the aquifer is actually negligible, so it may be omitted in the calculation of their age. Considering the fact that, in the study area which is terrain with elevated uranium concentration there is no significant effect of P-He on groundwater dating using the helium method, it can be concluded that the dating results obtained with this method in such areas can be fully comparable with those obtained for areas with lower concentrations of uranium. It was also found that mobile Ions of uranium and suspension of thorium compounds occurred in the groundwater are not a significant source of He in situ production within the studied aquifers.

TI Value of distributed water level and soil moisture data in the

AB This paper emphasizes the importance of integrating outlet discharge and observed internal variables in the evaluation of distributed hydrological models outputs. It proposes a general methodology for a diagnostic evaluation of a complex distributed hydrological model, based on discharge data at the outlet and additional distributed information such as water level and surface soil moisture data. The proposed methodology is illustrated using the PUMMA model in the Mercier sub-catchment (6.6 km(2)). Model parameters are specified according to field data and a previous study performed in a neighbouring catchment (Jankowfsky et al., 2014), without calibration. The distributed water level and soil moisture network of sensors were useful in the model evaluation process. Thus, model parameters are specified either using in situ information or results from previous studies. A stepwise approach is used for model evaluation. It includes standard water balance assessment as well as comparison of observed and simulated outlet discharge, whether on annual or event timescales. Soil moisture sensors are used to assess the ability of the model to simulate seasonal water storage dynamics based on a normalized index. The water level sensors network is used on two timescales: on a seasonal timescale, sensors network is used to assess the model's ability to simulate intermittency; whereas on event timescales, sensors network is used in determining the model's ability to reproduce observed reaction as well as response times. Event timescales do also focus on the correlation between hydrological response and either rainfall event or antecedent soil moisture variables. Results show that the non-calibrated model is quite effective at capturing water flow and soil water-storage dynamics, but it fails to reproduce observed runoff volume during events. There is strong indication of a deficiency in the characterization of catchment storage and upstream flowpath description. The soil water content and a network of water level sensors provide interesting information about soil moisture and river flow dynamics. They however fail to provide quantitative information about catchment storage. This study opens interesting perspectives for the evaluation of distributed hydrological models using hydrological signatures. Furthermore, it highlights the requirement of quantitative as well as qualitative signatures for improving such models.

AB In this study, with the use of a multiple linear regression approach, the tree-ring chronologies of eight sampling sites in the upper Lancang-Mekong River Basin were developed to provide a 449-year (CE 1557-2005) reconstruction of the annual runoff, thus placing recent changes in annual runoff into a long-term context. These eight tree-ring chronologies have recently been archived in publicly available databases through the International Tree-Ring Data Bank. Reconstruction results showed a good correlation coefficient of 0.662 (n = 39, p-value < 0.01) between the reconstructed and the observed annual runoff. The adjusted coefficient (R-2) for the degrees of freedom is 42.3%, which meets the precision requirements of reconstruction. The reconstructed runoff displays a trend toward more moist conditions: there were 37 extremely wet years and 23 extremely dry years, exceeding the mean +/- 1 standard deviation, during the past 449 years. Empirical mode decomposition (EMD) was used to fully analyze and understand the multi-scale variation of the reconstructed runoff. Six intrinsic mode function (IMF) components with different scales were obtained and the sum of all components can be reverted to the original variable sequence. The first and second IMF mainly reflect the change characteristics of the interannual scale of reconstructed sequence. Both are likely controlled by the Quasi-Biennial Oscillation (QBO) and the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), respectively. The third IMF showed a 10-13 year scale fluctuation, which is very similar to the solar activity of an 11-year cycle. The fourth and fifth IMF mainly represents multidecadal and centennial oscillations, and they have shown coherent variations with predecessors' reconstructed May-September precipitations in the same time domain. The lowest frequency component (the residue IMF) represents the trend term of the original signal.

AB Three hydroelectric reservoirs (Kralkizi, Dicle and Batman) in the Tigris River basin (Turkey) were sampled monthly during one year in order to reveal spatial and seasonal changes in aqueous partial pressure of CO2 (pCO(2)) and to estimate diffusive fluxes of CO2 from the reservoirs' surface water. pCO(2) concentrations did not show significant spatial differences, while they showed significant seasonal variations. Temperature, precipitation and biological CO2 uptake through photosynthesis controlled pCO(2) seasonality in the reservoirs, with maximal concentrations in the winter (ranging from 516.9 mu atm in Kralkizi to 1299.2 mu atm in Dicle) and minimal concentrations in the spring (ranging from 47.7 mu atm in Batman to 140.7 mu atm in Kralkizi). Most studies reported that reservoirs worldwide are net sources of CO2 to the atmosphere. However, the reservoirs in this study were sinks for atmospheric CO2 during the spring, summer and autumn seasons, while they were CO2 sources to the atmosphere during the winter. Air-water CO2 fluxes in Kralkizi, Dicle and Batman dam reservoirs were 2.39, 32.88 and 8.12 mmol/m(2)/day in the winter, respectively. On an annual basis, all three reservoirs acted as a sink for atmospheric CO2. These estimated CO2 fluxes were in the lower range for temperate reservoirs, despite the potential for winter conditions that shifted the reservoirs from sink to net source for atmospheric CO2.

AB We report evaporation characteristics due to higher heating from above from surfaces having an array of line sources. The line sources are created by vertically stacked rectangular plates in a box with water. Two different types of plates were used. In one case line source or film thickness was 66 mu m and open area ratio was 4%, and in the second case film thickness was 28 mu m and 20% was the open area ratio. Even at the 4% open area ratio the evaporation rate was similar to 85% compared to a bare water surface, at the same heat flux. Lateral conduction of heat from the impervious hotter regions to the line sources and the 2-D nature of diffusion near these tiny line sources enhances the evaporative flux, owing to increase in the concentration gradient of water vapour, explains the high evaporation rate, observed in the present work. This system bridges the gap between the understanding of evaporation from bare water surfaces (1-D vapour diffusion) and leaf surfaces (3-D vapour diffusion). Evaporation rates for the fully saturated conditions are in good agreement with the theoretical predictions of Suzuki and Maeda (1968) and Schlunder (1988). The computed surface temperatures and its width-wise variation match well with the experimental values. We also propose a simple film model for the unsaturated condition of the porous medium and show that the temperature distribution obtained using this model is in reasonably good agreement with the measured values.

AB Based on the runoff and sediment load data series obtained at the Guide hydrological station (GHS) in the upper reaches of the Yellow River from 1960 to 2013, the varying quasi-periodic fluctuations of runoff and sediment load existing in different decomposed time scales are revealed by using the complementary ensemble empirical mode decomposition (CEEMD) method pre- and post-reservoir operation. Combined with entropy theory, the concepts of multi-time scale entropy (MTSE) and multi-time scale structural entropy (MTSSE) are proposed to analyze the complex fluctuation characteristics of runoff and sediment load at different time scales. The results show that reservoir operation has a greater influence on sediment load than that on runoff at multi-time scales, and that their correlations change as well. Additionally, reservoir operation can aggravate the complexity of the runoff and sediment load, but with longer fluctuation time scales, this complexity decreases and predictability increases. After reservoir operation, the fluctuation period of high frequency components in runoff and sediment load is elongated, and the information content of runoff and sediment load is focused at the short-middle time scale. Therefore, the available and reasonable monitoring and research periods for runoff and sediment load in the upper reaches of the Yellow River are suggested as 4-7 years and 3-4 years, respectively.

AB While extensive green roofs are popular measures for reducing and delaying stormwater runoff, design tools are needed to better predict roof performance based on material properties, geometry and climate. This paper investigates the EPA's Storm Water Management Model's (SWMM) green roof module for this purpose based on observed runoff from several roofs with different build-ups, geometry, and climates. First, the general model performance was investigated and secondly transferability of model parameters for similar roofs but different geometries and climates was tested. Individual models reproduced runoff hydrographs well (NSE 0.56-0.96), while the long-term modelling showed relatively large volume errors most likely due to insufficient representation of evapotranspiration in the model. Model parameters obtained at one site were only partly transferable to similar roof build-up at other sites. Transferability was better from models calibrated with wetter climates and higher intensity events to drier climates, than the opposite way. Multi-site calibration resulted in model parameters performing well for most sites, giving model parameters that could be used for the design of similar roof build-ups in comparable climates. However, large variability in obtained model parameters, large volume errors and the fact that the calibrated model parameters did not directly correspond to measured material properties, place concerns on the generality of the SWMM green roof module as a design tool.

AB Proxy forward solvers are commonly used in Bayesian solutions to inverse problems in hydrology and geophysics in order to make sampling of the posterior distribution, for example using Markov-chain-Monte-Carlo (MCMC) methods, computationally tractable. However, use of these solvers introduces model error into the problem, which can lead to strongly biased and overconfident parameter estimates if left uncorrected. Focusing on the specific example of estimating unsaturated hydraulic parameters in a layered soil from time-lapse ground-penetrating radar data acquired during a synthetic infiltration experiment, we show how principal component analysis, conducted on a suite of stochastic model-error realizations, can for some problems be used to build a sparse orthogonal basis for the model error arising from known forward solver approximations and/or simplifications. Projection of the residual onto this basis during MCMC permits identification and removal of the model error before calculation of the likelihood. Our results indicate that, when combined with an informal likelihood metric based on the expected behaviour of the l(2)-norm of the residual, this methodology can yield posterior parameter estimates exhibiting a marked reduction in bias and overconfidence when compared to those obtained with no model-error correction, at reasonable computational cost.

AB A stochastic hydro-geostatistical assessment approach is proposed to evaluate the predictability of streamflow simulation as a function of precipitation observation network density. This approach is based on the paradigm of a controlled data assimilation simulation algorithm, known as Observing System Simulation Experiment (OSSE). The OSSE-based algorithm is designed to simulate a data assimilation technique known as Statistical Interpolation (SI). In SI, observations are combined with short-term precipitation forecasts through variographic analysis. The assessment approach was designed in two stages. At the first stage of the assessment, SI precipitation analysis is stochastically simulated to construct a hypothetical true reference precipitation field, while at the second stage, the variographic by-products of the SI Gaussian process are used to perturb the reference field in order to produce the pseudo counterparts of the SI input components. The pseudo terms are then combined in SI to compute the pseudo precipitation analysis while various network scenarios are considered. Distributed hydrologic modeling is then performed to convert reference and pseudo analysis datasets into streamflow. The proposed assessment approach can be used to assess observation networks of various densities; however, it is particularly effective in sparsely gauged basins. To demonstrate the application of the approach to a real-world case, the sparse observation network in the Churchill River basin (CRB), which covers an area of roughly 296,000 km(2) in the Canadian boreal ecoclimatic region, was assessed. Regional Deterministic Precipitation Analysis from 2002 to 2012 was extracted from the Canadian Precipitation Analysis (CaPA) data assimilation system and used while generating the reference field. Gridded precipitation data from both stages of the assessment were used as input to WATFLOOD (TM) distributed hydrologic model. Quantitative assessment of streamflow suggested that an observation network with a density in the order of 3 stations/10,000 km(2) in the CRB can satisfy hydrological criteria while maintaining the network as an integral part of the CaPA's SI data assimilation technique.

AB Artificial recharge is an effective way to minimize dewatering-induced ground settlements in deep excavation. To ensure the success of a long-term recharge, it is necessary to redevelop recharge wells (i.e., pumping) periodically to prevent well clogging. Field measurements show that ground settlements will occur during the well redevelopment. This paper proposed a method referred to as the combined recharge to eliminate settlement during well redevelopment. In the proposed method, a row of recharge wells (AR well) is added at the side of the traditional recharge wells (PR wells) to compensate water loss due to PR well redevelopment. Two field tests (with and without use of combined recharge) are conducted to investigate the ground response to recharge and redevelopment. Test results show that building settlements will increase progressively during redevelopment for case without combined recharge. However, there are no significant surface settlements during redevelopment for the case with combined recharge.

AB Spatiotemporal variability, teleconnection, and predictability of the Korean precipitation related to large scale climate indices were examined based on leading patterns of observed monthly Rx5day and total precipitation through an empirical orthogonal teleconnection (EOT). Cross-correlation and lag regression analyses for the leading modes and global atmospheric circulation dataset were employed on a monthly basis. The spatial pattern of the leading EOT modes for Rx5day and total precipitation represents a northern inland mode for boreal summer and a southern coastal mode in boreal winter. The temporal evolution of the leading EOT modes exhibits increasing trends during summer season and decadal variability for winter season. The leading EOT patterns of Rx5day precipitation show more widespread coherent patterns than those of total precipitation during warm and cold seasons, while the former explains less variance in precipitation variability than the latter. The tropical ENSO forcing has a coherent teleconnection with September and November-December precipitation patterns, while the Indian Ocean dipole is identified as a driver for precipitation variability in September and November. The monsoon circulation over the western North Pacific also exhibits a significant negative correlation with winter precipitation EOTs, while tropical cyclone indices are positively correlated with the fall precipitation EOTs. The leading patterns of the September and December Rx5day precipitation time series are predictable at up to six month lead time from the tropical Pacific sea surface temperatures (SSTs), while a somewhat weak predictable response from Indian Ocean SSTs was only detected at longer lead times. In addition, predictability from the Pacific SSTs for above normal precipitation is greater than that for below normal precipitation.

AB Hydrologic models are important for effective water resources management. They vary in complexity from parsimonious, spatially lumped, to physically-based, fully distributed models, which are generally expected to outperform the former. Wide applications of complex models are limited due to high data and computational demands. Therefore, a new approach based on well-balanced model complexity is needed to obtain reasonable simulation results with low data requirements. This paper presents a novel 3DNet-Catch hydrologic model, developed to represent key processes in sloped catchments under a temperate climate with modest data requirements. 3DNet-Catch includes runoff simulations within computational units by employing the interception, snow and soil routines, as well as runoff and channel routing. The soil routine, which is the key model feature, combines the SCS-CN method, an analytically integrated nonlinear outflow equation and the Brooks-Corey relation for unsaturated conductivity in an innovative manner. To advance runoff routing in 3DNet-Catch, an approach for analytical integration of the linear and nonlinear outflow equations is implemented. Most model parameters are physically meaningful, thus facilitating model calibration. The model structure can be adjusted according to soil and groundwater flow data, and it can include hydraulic structures, thereby providing adaptability to local conditions. A comprehensive hydrologic evaluation framework is established and conducted to examine whether 3DNet-Catch is adequately parameterised and can accurately reproduce catchment hydrologic response. The model parameterisation is evaluated by sensitivity, identifiability and correlation analyses. Model efficiency is quantified in terms of performance measures, hydrologic signatures and plausibility of the simulated hydrological processes. The results show high sensitivity of the hydrologic variables and performance measures to the model parameters, particularly to those of the soil routine. The parameters are uncorrelated and generally well identifiable. The model performs equally well in the calibration and evaluation periods. High efficiency in the hydrological signatures related to the soil routine indicates its robustness. The results, therefore, suggest that 3DNet-Catch is a comprehensively parameterised, versatile hydrologic model. It realistically reproduces observed hydrographs with modest data requirements, thus being appropriate for both engineering applications and investigative catchment dynamics studies.

AB Operations of amount of large and medium reservoirs have remarkably changed runoff and sediment loads, and consequently affected the fluvial processes intensively on the upper Yellow River. In this study, time series of runoff and sediment transport rates of four major hydrological stations on the upper Yellow River were used to analyze temporal and spatial variations of runoff and sediment loads. Mann-Kendall test and wavelet analysis were applied to analyze the datasets. Temporal variations in runoff and sediment loads were discerned in terms of changing trend, abrupt change year, and multi-periods from the time series. Additionally, a time series of runoffs was reconstructed based on a modeling scenario removing impact of reservoir impoundment and water diversion to indicate the status without human disturbances. Comparison of the measured and reconstructed datasets was conducted to evaluate the impact of reservoir impoundment and water diversion on hydrological variations. The measured runoff and sediment loads showed obvious decreasing trends due to impoundment and water diversion. However, the reconstructed runoffs regarded as only affected by climate change showed no significant changing trend at a 95% confidence level, confirming that, instead of climate change, human activities played the most important roles in variations. The measured datasets indicated that the reservoir construction and operation caused an abrupt change in runoff in 1986, while the reconstructed datasets indicated another abrupt change in 1995. Wavelet transform analysis distinguished the multi-periodical features of the time series. The first, second, and third dominant periodicities of the measured runoffs were 25-27, 16, and 8 years, respectively, whereas the first three dominant periodicities of the reconstructed runoffs were 26-31, 12, and 7 years, respectively. It was indicated that the high-frequency periodicities of runoffs decreased while the low-frequency periodicities increased, owing to reservoir impoundment and water diversion.

AB Water Sensitive Urban Design (WSUD) stormwater systems, also known as Low Impact Development (LID) systems or Nature Based Solutions (NBS), are currently implemented based on the underlying assumption of statistical stationarity of rainfall, which threatens to become outdated under climatic uncertainty. This paper applies a new downscaling method to examine the implications of climate change on future rainfall and evaluate the reliability of WSUD stormwater infrastructure in pollution reduction, flow frequency mitigation and reliability as an alternative water supply. A variety of future atmospheric scenarios are considered as part of this comprehensive assessment by analysing an ensemble of eight different downscaled General Circulation Models (GCMs). High resolution catchment-scale rainfall projections for Melbourne, Australia were generated using a scheme called High-resolution Downscaling of Rainfall Using STEPS (HiDRUS) at a fine 1 km and 6-min scale for more precise analysis with uncertainty estimates. Statistical analyses show that, in general, the climate models predict a drier future with fewer rainfall events and longer dry periods when comparing the simulated near future (2040-2049) periods against the base-line period (1995-2004). The difference simulated between historical and future rainfall projections show minimum difference of WSUD performance in pollution removal and flow frequency reduction, with slightly lower harvesting reliability ( < 3%) observed under future climate; high variabilities, however, were observed across GCM simulations, indicating big uncertainties of system reliability under various conditions, e.g. design wetland sizes may vary from 2.5% to 4.0% of the impervious catchment area according to different future projects across GCMs. Larger WSUD systems are recommended to ensure reliable performance of pollution removal, as well as harvesting reliability under simulated future conditions. The significance of considering an ensemble of different GCMs as opposed to many scenarios generated by a single 'best' climate model was also demonstrated for the robust estimation of uncertainty in future WSUD reliability. This work highlights important considerations for the future design, management and quantitative evaluation of WSUD reliability.

AB Regionalization methods have been extensively discussed as the solution for runoff predictions in ungauged basins (PUB), especially during the PUB decade (2003-2012). At the same time, research topics relevant to climate change appear to be an essential and attractive field for hydrologists in recent decades, because the availability and quality of water resources are strongly affected by climate change. However, it is still unknown whether regionalization methods can be used to predict hydrological impacts of climate change for ungauged catchments or how much uncertainty of future predictions may result from the use of regionalization methods. Therefore, in this study, we investigate the transferability of regionalization methods (i.e. spatial proximity and physical similarity methods, regression method) under changing climate conditions and compare the uncertainty resulting from regionalization methods with that from using climate models. The investigation is based on 108 catchments in Norway, with large variability in climate conditions and geographic characteristics. The study applies a lumped conceptual rainfall-runoff model (WASMOD) with simple structure and six model parameters. Our result shows that (a) the differences in the predictions by the regionalization methods tend to increase in the future, (b) the physical similarity method with parameter option (i.e. the model parameters from the physically-similar donor catchments are first averaged and then used to run the model for the target catchment) shows higher transferability than other methods, (c) the uncertainty contributions from climate models and regionalization methods to future runoff prediction are basin dependent, and (d) the uncertainty of future runoff prediction due to regionalization methods can be higher than that from climate models in low precipitation areas. This study provides insight to the choice of regionalization methods under changing climate conditions and the role of regionalization methods to the uncertainty contributions in future runoff predictions.

AB In the United States, fluvial flood risk is managed by the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP), which delineates areas that have a 1% chance of flooding each year (i.e. the 100-year floodplain). Development within and adjacent to riverine floodplains exacerbates flood losses by increasing peak discharge and runoff volume, shortening the time to peak, and altering the extent of the floodplain. This paper improves understanding of how future development can alter the 100-year floodplain in a watershed in Houston, TX through land use projection, hydrologic and hydraulic modeling, and implements a novel method for considering the impact of both regional trends in development and site-scale development policies on runoff response. The methodology presented in this paper integrates future development scenarios from a machine learning land use projection model with distributed hydrologic modeling and coupled 1D/2D unsteady hydraulic modeling to produce future floodplain estimates. Current site-scale detention requirements are represented within the hydrologic model to evaluate the regional effectiveness of these policies under future development conditions in 2050. Results indicate that the 100-year floodplain can expand by up to 12.5% across the watershed as a result of projected development in 2050 using current stormwater mitigation policies, and the number of parcels within the floodplain can increase by up to 18.8%. This study demonstrates how incremental land use changes can significantly alter the reality of flood risk in urbanizing watersheds, and how existing land use policies may be insufficient to mitigate impacts from future development.

AB The water resources-water environment carrying capacity (WR-WECC) is an important indicator for judging the regional macro-control ability of water resources. The nature-based solutions (NBS) concept is related closely to sustainability, harmonious and green development, resources rational exploitation, coupled human and environment, and ecological protection priority. Participatory water management has necessitated the formation of village water resources committees and/or village environmental committees; while in the case of water management, a participatory approach has resulted in the formation of community water association, domestic water committees, cooperative societies, and various water user groups. The WR-WECC evaluation goal is to find the most appropriate water resources development and utilization to maximize benefits and system efficiency while minimizing costs and trade-offs. To realize the development and utilization of water resources, water ecological conservation, and water environment protection in Yuetang District, we constructed a dynamic evaluation index system including water resources, water environment and water ecological characteristics, applying the principal component analysis (PCA) method to evaluate the temporal scale variation tendency of WR-WECC, and explore a deep-seated reason based on NBS. The WR-WECC evaluation index system covered 16 indexes belonging to three subsystems of water resource, socioeconomic, and eco-environmental systems. We used Statistical Product and Service Solutions (SPSS) 19.0 software and adopted the improved PCA to integrate the urban economic-social-ecological development of the Xiangjiang (a tributary of the Yangtze River) River Basin. We applied the evaluation index system to analyse the trend variability of WR-WECC of Yuetang District from 2005 to 2015 based on NBS. The WR-WECC of Yuetang District was affected mainly by the urban sewage treatment rate, the water use amount per ten thousand Yuan gross domestic product (GDP), and per capita water resources. In addition to minor fluctuations in 2007 and 2011, the WR-WECC in Yuetang District was generally on the rise year by year and was related to socioeconomic development level, regional water environment comprehensive management, and awareness of water ecological protection. The WR-WECC of the Yuetang District in 2013-2015 was in a Class I (excellent) condition. The temporal variations analysis based on NBS was proposed through a combination of economic-social-ecological values provided by nature-based development and utilization patterns. Based on the relationship among regional water resources, economic society, and eco-environment protection, the paper supplied a WR-WECC improvement strategy that was suitable for the development and utilization of water resources in a water-rich area in south China.

AB Pumping stations (PSs) are common regulation facilities in a water distribution system, with complex hydraulic characteristics and hydraulic parameters. In this study, a data assimilation-based approach was proposed for the correction of PS parameters, in which a 1D hydrodynamic model with PS inner boundary was established, and then the Ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) framework was used to correct PS parameters. In EnKF framework, the combination of the PS parameters was considered as the state vector, and water levels and discharge as observation vectors. The 1D hydrodynamic model was taken as the observation operator that constructs the mapping relationship between the state and the observation vector. The method's reliability was demonstrated through the case of Niantou PS in the middle route of South-North Water Transfer Project. Verification results show that the proposed method can accurately inverse PS parameters. Compared with the simulation results using PS parameters based on physical model experiments, the PS parameters corrected by the data assimilation method can greatly improve the accuracy of the hydrodynamic simulation. This data assimilation-based method can be used for parameter inversion of other complex hydraulic structures.

AB A unified pipe-network-based numerical manifold method (NMM) is developed to simulate immiscible two-phase flow in a geological medium. Both heterogeneous and non-heterogeneous geological media can be discretized as numerical pipe networks, which have high efficiency and accuracy in simulating fluid and mass transfer in fractured rock masses. A manifold element method is developed to solve the governing equations of immiscible two-phase flow in pipes. The developed NMM can simulate moving and deforming of two-phase flow interface. A grid-based front-tracking method updates the marker points constructing the fluid interface explicitly in each time step. The effectiveness of the NMM is verified through analytical and finite element analysis. Parametric studies are conducted by simulating immiscible two-phase flows with various fluid properties in homogeneous and inhomogeneous geological conditions. The results show that the developed method can efficiently simulate the moving interface of two-phase flow in geological media, including effects such as "viscous fingering", a noteworthy phenomenon in enhanced oil recovery. When the mobility of the driving fluid is larger than that of the driven fluid, the inhomogeneity of the medium can cause the fluid interface to roughen, which increases over time during the process of two-phase flow. For the inverse situation, although the fluid interface remains rough, the roughness variation throughout the process is not prominent.

AB To determine the influence of the Mesozoic Yanshanian orogeny in East Asia on contemporaneous Sr isotopic evolution of seawater, we systematically investigated the weathering profile, riverbed sediment and stream water in mono-lithological small granitic watersheds of the Jiuhua Mountains, Anhui, eastern China. Analysis based on 190 samples from 1 to 2 samplings per month during an entire hydrological year, spanning July 2014 to June 2015, shows that the infra-annual change of Sr concentration is 10-70%, but Sr-87/Sr-86 ratios only exhibit a slight change (0.709148-0.710427). This result indicates that using single sampling data to evaluate the influence of chemical weathering on the Sr-87/Sr-86 ratio evolution of seawater may cause some deviations. The Sr-87/Sr-86 ratio in the small granitic watersheds of the Jiuhua Mountains is 0.709148-0.710427 with an average of 0.710021, which is significantly higher than the lowest value (0.7068, similar to 160 Ma) of seawater in the Phanerozoic. During and after this period, the East Asian continent experienced a strong tectonic event - Yanshanian orogeny and formed widespread Jurassic-Cretaceous igneous rocks, such as the Jiuhua Mountains granite in the Yangtze Block. The Yanshanian granites in several main tectonic units in China exhibit high radiogenic Sr characteristics. Combined with the evidence of enhanced chemical weathering during Late Jurassic-Early Cretaceous, the notable increase of the seawater Sr-87/Sr-86 ratio after 160 Ma may be related to the Yanshanian orogeny in East Asia.

AB Mountainous regions are important sources of freshwater. Measurement of actual evapotranspiration (ET) is difficult to obtain in high mountain regions because of the harsh natural environment, and potential ET (PET) is therefore a suitable term to describe the atmospheric water demand of land surfaces under given meteorological conditions in those high elevation areas. In situ measured meteorological data were collected in 2015 and 2016 from five meteorological stations at various elevations from 2980 m to 4484 m in the Qilian Mountains, northwestern China, and the meteorological factors changed markedly with elevation. PET calculated with the Penman method showed a significant elevational gradient, and decreased as the elevation increased. The sensitivity analysis indicated that over the whole period, PET in the research region was most sensitive to net radiation (RN), followed by relative humidity (RH), air temperature (T), wind speed (WS) and soil heat flux (G). When RN was positive, the sensitivity of PET to RN decreased as the elevation increased, and when RN was negative, the sensitivity increased as the elevation increased. When T was above 0 degrees C, the sensitivity of PET to T decreased as the elevation increased, and when T was below 0 degrees C, the sensitivity increased as the elevation increased. The higher the elevation, the greater the sensitivity of PET to both RH and WS. The topographic shading in mountainous regions affected meteorological factors, PET and its sensitivity to meteorological factors in those high elevation areas. The RN was relatively small at the sites with topographic shading because of the reduction in solar radiation, and resulted in less sensitivity of PET to RN and greater sensitivity of PET to other meteorological factors. This study can help us to understand PET in the Qilian mountains and in other mountain regions from which meteorological data are difficult to obtain and very sensitive to climate change.

AB Projections of future changes in hydroclimatic variables are available through various general circulation models (GCMs) that are part of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5). Assessment of the performance of these models in simulating past climate, both individually and as an ensemble, has received much attention and is commonly the first step in assessing their suitability of application. In this study, we have evaluated the ability of various ensemble models to simulate past temperature and precipitation in the Gulf Basin region of North America, chosen as an illustrative case study. We have developed ensembles from 34 CMIP5 GCMs using six diverse approaches, including random forest, support vector regression, neural networks, linear regression, and weighted k-nearest neighbors, and compared the performance of the ensembles with each other and the individual GCMs using a robust set of metrics and nonparametric tests. For temperature, random forest outperforms all other ensembles and the best-performing GCM by a statistically significant margin and is able to simulate temporal and spatial patterns in temperature well. None of the ensembles are able to adequately simulate observed precipitation patterns in the study area, likely due to spatial differences in precipitation drivers in the region, as well as the coarseness of the dataset itself. However, the random forest, support vector regression, neural network, and linear regression ensembles achieved statistically significant improvements to precipitation simulation, as compared to the individual GCMs and the simple arithmetic mean ensemble, which has been used in several studies.

AB Assessing the sensitivity of groundwater systems to hydroclimate variability is critical to sustainable management of the water resources of Guam, US territory. We assess spatial and temporal variability of isotopic and geochemical compositions of vadose and phreatic groundwater sampled from cave drip sites and production wells, respectively, to better understand the vulnerability of the freshwater lens on Guam to variability in hydroclimate. We independently evaluate the existing conceptual model of the Northern Guam Lens Aquifer that is largely based on physical, as opposed to geochemical, observations. Sampling was conducted from 2008 to 2015, over which rainfall gradually increased. Major ion geochemistry and Sr isotope values of groundwater show varying influence from soil, limestone bedrock, and seawater. Geochemical modeling that can explain spatial variability in groundwater Na+ and Mg2+ concentrations and Sr/Ca and Sr-87/Sr-86 values indicates that groundwater compositions are dominantly controlled by mixing of freshwater with seawater and water-rock interaction. Differences between amount-weighted annual average precipitation delta O-18 values and groundwater delta O-18 values indicate a recharge bias toward the wet season, consistent with other tropical carbonate island aquifer settings. Infra- and inter-annual variations in Na+ concentrations and delta O-18 values in groundwater reflect sensitivity of recharge to seasonal variations in rainfall amount and changes in annual rainfall amounts. Our results indicate the influence of multiple modes of recharge on groundwater compositions and spatial variability in the sensitivity of groundwater to seawater mixing. This sensitivity of the freshwater lens points to the vulnerability of groundwater resources to changes in recharge associated with climate, land-use change, and increases in population.

AB Monthly streamflow time series are highly non-linear. How to improve forecast accuracy is a great challenge in hydrological studies. A lot of research has been conducted to address the streamflow forecasting problem, however, few methods are developed to make a systematic research. The objective of this study is to understand the underlying trend of streamflow so that a regression model can be developed to forecast the flow volume. In this paper, a hybrid streamflow forecast framework is proposed that integrates factor analysis, time series decomposition, data regression, and error suppression. Correlation coefficients between the current streamflow and the streamflow with lags are analyzed using autocorrelation function (ACF), partial autocorrelation function (PACE), and grey correlation analysis (GCA). Support vector regression (SVR) and generalized regression neural network (GRNN) models are integrated with seasonal and trend decomposition to make monthly streamflow forecast. Auto-regression and multi-model combination error correction methods are used to ensure the accuracy. In our experiments, the proposed method is compared with a stochastic autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) streamflow forecast model. Fourteen models are developed, and the monthly streamflow data of Shigu and Xiangjiaba, China from 1961 to 2009 are used to evaluate our proposed method. Our results demonstrate that the integrated model of grey correlation analysis, Seasonal-Trend Decomposition Procedure Based on Loess (STL), Support Vector Regression (GCA-STL-SVR) exhibits an improved performance for monthly streamflow forecast. The average error of the proposed model is reduced to less than one-tenth in contrast to the state-of-the-art method and the standard deviation is also reduced by more than 30%, which implies a greater consistency.

AB This study employs a systematic literature review to investigate how insurance data can be applied in the analysis of Surface Water Flood events. The study firstly identifies the variables expressing insurance data and those explaining them, together with their interrelationships. Damage variables may be expressed as either monetary-based or number of claims-based. Explaining variables may be subdivided into four categories: meteorological, geographic, demographic and property/building-based. Most of the common and under-researched combinations of these variables and their expression are discussed. Secondly, a comparative analysis is presented of current models, highlighting their differences and similarities. The study demonstrates that the scope and approach of the models varies in relation to scale, the coverage and period of incorporated insurance claims, and the methods used for model development and validation. Thirdly, the study proposes a generic and adaptable framework, constructed from an aggregation of information contained in relevant literature, to define a work-flow for model development and future deployment. The study concludes with a discussion of the challenges facing model development and opportunities for deployment.

AB We investigate the ability to improve flood inundation forecasts at short- to medium-range (1-7 days) timescales through weather ensembles and statistical water surface elevation (WSE) postprocessing. To generate the flood inundation forecasts, a one-dimensional hydraulic model, namely the Hydrologic Engineering Center's River Analysis System (HEC-RAS), is coupled to a regional hydrological ensemble prediction system (RHEPS). The RHEPS is comprised of: i) hydrometeorological observations; ii) weather ensembles from the National Centers for Environmental Prediction Global Ensemble Forecast System Reforecast version 2 (GEFSRv2); and iii) Hydrology Laboratory Research Distributed Hydrologic Model (HL-RDHM) as the hydrological model. The coupled RHEPS-hydraulic system is evaluated along the tidal Delaware River near the City of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, U.S. For the evaluation, emphasis is placed on the tidal-riverine transitional zone of the Delaware River and the downstream propagation of hydrometeorological uncertainty through the flood inundation forecasts. The coupled system is used to generate hourly flood inundation forecasts at lead times from 1 to 7 days, over the period 2008-2013. Additionally, WSEs from the coupled system are statistically postprocessed using quantile regression (QR). Results show that the raw flood inundation ensemble forecasts exhibit higher skill than the deterministic ones. We also find that statistical postprocessing improves the skill of the raw flood inundation ensemble forecasts, with greater improvements at the longer lead times (> 3 days). Overall, we find that both weather ensembles and statistical WSE postprocessing can be used to enhance the skill of flood inundation forecasts at short- to medium-range timescales. In turn, this may serve to enhance the spatial representation of flood forecasts several days in advance, which could contribute in the future to making flood forecast communication and warnings more effective.

AB Recent significant channel evolution in the Jingjiang Reach has raised much attention, particularly the remarkable bank erosion. A coupled model for simulating bed deformation and bank erosion has been proposed in this study, which focuses on the erosion of the bank with a composite structure in the Lower Jingjiang Reach. In order to cover three contributing processes that may interact with each other, the proposed model integrates a one-dimensional morphodynamic module with a two-dimensional module of ground water flow and a bank erosion module for the cantilever failure of a composite riverbank. Model performance was evaluated through a detailed simulation of channel evolution along a 150.8-km subreach in the Jingjiang Reach over the 2005 hydrological year. Satisfying results were obtained from the simulation, showing relatively close agreement between the calculations and measurements in terms of hydrological data at the outlet section, bank erosion sites, longitudinal channel profile and typical cross-sectional profiles. In addition, investigations into temporal changes in bank soil properties and critical overhanging width at cantilever failure demonstrate that there was a seasonal variation in the volumetric water content of bank soil, which increased during the rising and flood periods and then decreased during the recession period, showing an impact on the occurrence timing of cantilever failures. The tensile strength and critical overhanging width had an inverse relationship with the water content, whereas the critical width sharply increased and then decreased during high flows affected by a rapid change in river stage. The temporal distribution of cantilever failure events indicates that cantilever failure primarily occurred in the flood and recession periods. The effects of bed roughness, water content variation and secondary flow on bank erosion were also discussed.

AB Assessing flood frequency is pivotal for hydrology, with implications for many fields ranging from river science to the insurance industry. Reservoir regulation may alter the characteristics of the flood frequency distribution function. This paper incorporates reservoir impacts as an inherent variable to derive an analytical solution of outflow peaks and proposes new flood frequency distributions. Steps are as follows: (1) the original flood without reservoir impacts is assumed to follow a Pearson type III distribution, (2) linear and nonlinear reservoir models, including numerical integration and triangular area calculation methods, are proposed to simulate the relationships between inflow and outflow peaks, and (3) the flood frequency distributions resulting from reservoir impacts are derived. Derived equations are applied to the Shuibuya and Wuqiangxi reservoirs in China. Results show that: (1) although the numerical integration method with the nonlinear model is comparable with the reservoir flood routing, the triangle area calculation method with the nonlinear model is recommended for its accuracy and simplicity, (2) the reservoir regulation changes the flood frequency distribution function entirely in the nonlinear reservoir model, while only change the parameter in the linear reservoir model, and (3) downstream flood's CV can be increased or decreased, which depends on the reservoir regulating capacity. It is indicated that altering the parameters of the flood frequency distribution is not sufficient to characterize watershed under reservoir control. This paper proposes the analytical solution about inflow and outflow peaks, which can point out the possible changes in the watershed with reservoir construction in plan.

AB In porosity models for urban flooding, artificial porosity is used as a statistical descriptor of the urban medium. Buildings are treated as subgrid-scale features and, even with the use of relatively coarse grids, their effects on the flow are accounted for. Porosity models are attractive for large-scale applications due to limited computational demand with respect to solving the classical Shallow Water Equations on high-resolution grids. In the last decade, effective schemes have been developed that allowed accounting for a wealth of sub-grid processes; unfortunately, they are known to suffer from oversensitivity to mesh design in the case of anisotropic porosity fields, which are typical of urban layouts. In the present study, a dual porosity approach is implemented into a two-dimensional Finite Element numerical scheme that uses a staggered unstructured mesh. The presence of buildings is modelled using an isotropic porosity in the continuity equation, to account for the reduced water storage, and a tensor formulation for conveyance porosity in the momentum equations, to account for anisotropy and effective flow velocity. The element-by-element definition of porosities, and the use of a staggered grid in which triangular cells convey fluxes and continuity is balanced at grid nodes, allow avoiding undesired mesh-dependency. Tested against refined numerical solutions and data from a laboratory experiment, the model provided satisfactory results. Model limitations are discussed in view of applications to more complex, real urban layouts.

AB Diffusion is the dominating process in the migration of contaminants through landfill liners, below which the soils are generally unsaturated. Analytical method is often considered as a preferred approach over numerical method to solve diffusion problems. In this study, a one-dimensional diffusion model of contaminants is firstly developed to account for unsaturated properties of the soils beneath landfill barriers. Based on an assumption of linear water pressure distribution, the nonlinear governing equation in the diffusion model is transformed into a linear equation using an exponential expression of soil water retention curve and a linear model of unsaturated diffusion coefficient. Subsequently, the corresponding analytical solution is obtained and the solution is then applied to investigate the effects of soil type, water pressure condition and groundwater depth on the diffusion of contaminants. The analytical results show that groundwater depth has the most influential effect on the steady flux rate of contaminants. Furthermore, the obtained steady flux rates in soil layers with high desaturation rate are negligible when the groundwater depth exceeds 3 m and 2 m. The results also indicate that a thicker soil layer with high desaturation rate is recommended to be an effective diffusion barrier to mitigate the pollution of the underlying soils and groundwater.

AB Climate-induced disturbances are expected to increase in frequency and intensity and affect wetland ecology by altering its hydrology. Investigating how wetland hydrology responds to climate disturbances is an important first step to understand the ecological response of coastal wetlands to these disturbances. Wetland hydrologic resilience, the ability of wetland in absorbing disturbances and restoring to pre-disturbance conditions in hydrological function, is a critical measure of wetland hydrological response to climate disturbances. However, a practical methodology for quantifying wetland hydrologic resilience (HR) is still lacking. This study aimed to improve the approach for quantifying the hydrologic resilience of wetland ecosystems to climate variability and climate change. A set of quantitative metrics was developed including the variations of groundwater table, overland flow, and saltwater table. This approach was then applied to a coastal landscape that includes coastal-forested and herbaceous wetlands in North Carolina, USA. We investigated the threshold behaviors of groundwater table, overland flow, and saltwater table for a 20-year period (1995-2014) by applying a regional scale wetland hydrological model, Penn State Integrated Hydrological Model for wetland hydrology (PIHM-Wetland). We found that the multiscale variations of groundwater table under dry climatic conditions is a good indicator of wetland HR to drought. The variation of overland flow during rainfall events effectively quantified HR to wet periods. We also found that the variation of the water level of saltwater is an important metric of wetland HR to sea level rise. This study improves the methodology of quantifying wetland hydrologic resilience at a regional scale, representing an important first step towards understanding the wetland hydrological and ecological resilience to future intensified climate disturbances in coastal regions and beyond.

AB Hydropower production is altering the Mekong River basin's riverine ecosystems, which contain the world's largest inland fishery and provide food security and livelihoods to millions of people. The basin's hydropower reservoir storage, which may rise from similar to 2% of its mean annual flow in 2008 to similar to 20% in 2025, is attenuating seasonal flow variability downstream of many dams with integral powerhouses and large storage reservoirs. In addition, tributary diversions for off-stream energy production are reducing downstream flows and augmenting them in recipient tributaries. To help manage tradeoffs between dam benefits (hydropower, irrigation, flood control, domestic water supply, and navigation) and their consequences for livelihoods and ecosystems, we review observed and projected impacts on river flows along both the Mekong mainstream and its tributaries. We include the effects of diversions and inter-basin transfers, which prior reviews of flow alteration in the Mekong basin have largely neglected. We also discuss the extent to which concurrent changes in climate, water demand, and land use, may offset or exacerbate hydropower-induced flow alteration. Our major recommendations for assessing hydrological impacts in the Mekong and other basins undergoing rapid hydropower development include synchronizing and integrating observational and modeling studies, improving the accuracy of reservoir water balances, evaluating multi-objective reservoir operating rules, examining hydropeaking-induced flow alteration, conducting multi-dam safety assessments, evaluating flow indicators relevant to local ecosystems and livelihoods, and considering alternative energy sources and reservoir sedimentation in long-term projections. Finally, we strongly recommend that dam impact studies consider hydrological alteration in conjunction with fish passage barriers, geomorphic changes and other contemporaneous stressors.

AB A Lagrangean particle based transport model is introduced to calculate the potential contamination paths of solutes in drainage water in an urban area during a pluvial flood event. The necessity to capture the complexity of a surface runoff model and the coupling of pipe and surface are investigated. Results show that fully coupled hydrodynamic models are needed for a good representation of transport paths and breakthrough curves of contaminant concentration in drainage water. An analysis for time variation of a single location spill event is performed that shows a high variability in solute spreading depending on the spill relative to the rainfall characteristics.

AB The most uncertain parameter in determining the stage-discharge relationship of an ungauged stream is the friction factor, a parameter for which a gauged stream can be back-calculated using hydrometric survey data that has been compiled over a wide range of flow conditions. The existing friction factor models for ungauged streams that do not require hydrometric survey data as input can have very large prediction errors. In this study, 415 streamflow events collected from 52 rivers across three continents were assembled to allow for the use of a suitable global dataset size/range to develop a robust model for the prediction of the friction factor in ungauged streams using two machine learning algorithms (Gene Expression Programing (GEP) and Extreme Learning Machine (ELM)). The new GEP and ELM models outperformed existing models with significantly improved R-squared values of 0.76 and 0.78, respectively. The combination of the two input parameters (relative smoothness and the friction slope) allowed the new models to more accurately predict the friction factor for a wider range of streams and flow conditions. The forecasting uncertainty of the developed GEP and ELM models were compared with past models and found to be the least uncertain, with Width Uncertainty Band (WUB) values of +/- 0.0536 and +/- 0.0504, respectively. For the first time in this field of research, partial derivative sensitivity analysis was applied to the trends of the friction factor estimation by GEP and ELM. It was found that GEP and ELM models are extremely sensitive to friction slope in comparison with relative smoothness. The GEP and ELM model results for predicting the Darcy-Weisbach friction factor were compared with different existing relationships, and the superior performance of the proposed models was illustrated.

AB Due to the rapid decline of in situ observations on river discharge in Arctic regions, evaluation of the continental freshwater input to the Arctic Ocean has become problematic and necessitates the development of alternative approaches based on remote sensing. Radar altimetric satellites have demonstrated high potential for estimation of river water discharge. Compared to polar orbiting altimeters, non-polar orbit satellites have an advantage in temporal sampling. Their greatest drawback, however, is spatial coverage: observations do not cover the low reaches of most parts of Arctic rivers. In this study of the Lena River, we demonstrate a way to overcome this limitation by using a combination of in situ observations from tributaries and satellite observations in the middle river reaches. The water discharge as well as monthly and annual water flow were evaluated using three virtual stations. Direct combination of the water level from these virtual stations was not possible because of the difference in seasonal amplitude. However, the combination of altimetric discharge from the three independently processed tracks significantly improves the flow retrievals. The accuracy of the monthly water flow estimates at the river outlet is 23%. It increases with the integration time giving 7% for annual flow.

We distinguish between the studies focusing on the flow in (i) a single street intersection, (ii) surface-sewer exchanges, (iii) an array of obstacles and (iv) quasi-realistic urban districts. We discuss the main flow processes which are covered in the various studies and detail which flow variables were recorded. This enables identifying flow processes for which comprehensive experimental datasets are available from those which require additional experimental research. We also highlight the typical ranges of scale factors used, which depend mainly on the extent of the studied area (from very local up to the district level). This review aims at helping computational modellers to pinpoint the most suitable dataset for validating their numerical approaches and laboratory modellers to identify gaps in current experimental knowledge of urban flooding.

AB This study mainly evaluated and compared satellite-based quantitative precipitation estimate products (QPEs) for the drought monitoring of mainland China. Two long-term (more than 30 a) satellite-based QPEs, i.e. the Precipitation Estimation from Remotely Sensed Information using Artificial Neural Networks-Climate Data Record (PERSIANN-CDR) and the Climate Hazards Group InfraRed Precipitation with Station (CHIRPS), and a short-term (18a) QPE, i.e. the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) Multi-Satellite Precipitation Analysis (TMPA) 3B42V7 are considered. Two widely used drought indices, the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) and the Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI), are chosen to evaluate the drought monitoring utility. The 3B42V7 was only evaluated with PDSI due to the short data records. The results show that all the three QPEs perform satisfactorily in the eastern part of China when using both SPI and PDSI. However, their performances for west China could not be clearly determined due to the sparse gauge networks. 3B42V7 features best performance among the three QPEs in the evaluation using PDSI. To further spatiotemporally evaluate the drought utility of the QPEs, four typical drought-affected regions, i.e. northeast China (NEC), Huang-Huai-Hai plain (3HP), southwest China (SWC), and Loess plateau (LP) were extracted from mainland China for specific case studies. Temporally, all three QPEs are able to detect the typical drought of the four regions with both SPI and PDSI, and 3B42V7 presents the least deviation in PDSI estimate. Spatially, both CHIRPS and 3B42V7 accurately catch the spatial centers and extent of the typical drought events, while PERSIANN-CDR could not match the spatial patterns of drought events well. Generally, the long-term PERSIANN-CDR and CHIRPS perform satisfactorily in drought detection and are suitable for drought utility; however, caution should be applied when studying the spatial variation of drought using PERSIANN-CDR. CHIRPS could also be suitable for near-real-time drought monitoring for its shorter time latency of data release. The short-term 3B42V7 also performs well in many cases, and has thus considerable potential for drought monitoring.

AB Carbonate weathering by CO2 is considered to play an important role in the global carbon cycle. In acid rain-affected areas, the carbon cycle can be impacted by acid rain weathering. When previous studies have considered all possible weathering processes including H2SO4 in rainfall, sulfide oxidation and agricultural activities, this study proposed a geochemical method to specifically calculate the extent of carbonate weathering by acid rain using hydrogeochemical data from karstic spring and rainfall. This method has considered the H concentration and nitrification of NH4 in rain during recharge, and provided the upper limit of the weathering amount. Seasonal sampling for spring (wet and dry season) was conducted from a typical carbonate area in Jiaoshi, Chongqing, SW China, with annual rain pH values ranging from 3.94 to 4.70. The major hydrogeochemistry types of spring are HCO3-Ca and HCO3-Ca center dot Mg. The average proportion of carbonate weathering by acid rain is estimated to be 36 +/- 15%. The quantitative geochemical method provided in this study is important for understanding the hydrogeochemical processes in acid rain areas and for calculating CO2 sources & sinks of carbonate weathering.

AB Forest growth dynamics affect streamflow with changes in actual evapotranspiration (AET) during forest regeneration. Using a "top-down" model approach, we present a seasonal forest hydrology model that estimates streamflow in forested catchments containing sparse soil and climate data. Across a 1423 km(2) remote study area, a rainfall interpolation procedure using available rainfall data and information on terrain was integrated into a new seasonal streamflow model, called ABCF, which uses catchment sapwood area (SA) as the emergent property that equilibrates with potential evapotranspiration (PET), and a soil storage threshold that reduces AET below PET when soil water is limiting. We produce seasonal estimates of streamflow with Nash Sutcliffe efficiencies of 0.85, 0.87, and 0.91 for three major catchments within the study area. A fundamental feature of the "top-down" model approach is the use of LiDAR data and forest inventory data to model forest structural properties that relate strongly with SA. Building on our previous work with this modelling framework, our representation of eco-hydrological properties of the forest has been refined with a more accurate procedure for estimating stand mean sapwood thickness, and hence SA, and a remotely sensed tree stocking density (N) of old-growth forests to correct the temporal evolution of N as a means to improve SA estimates. Regional consistency of model parameters shows that the "top-down" modelling framework may be used to estimate streamflow in ungauged catchments using a forest growth model. The seasonal model generalised for both water-limited and water-unlimited forest conditions has significant potential for application in water supply planning and drought security.

AB With intensifying climate change, droughts over Southwest China (SWC) are drawing increasing interest. The droughts of 2009-2011 have attracted special concern. However, the roles of atmospheric evaporative demand [reflected by reference evapotranspiration (ET0)] and precipitation (P) anomalies in drought evolutions are still unclear. To that end, we revisited the evolution of the 2009-2011 SWC meteorological droughts quantitatively and comprehensively by quantifying the ET0 and P impacts. In terms of three drought parameters [i.e., drought intensity (DI), area (DA), and duration (DD)], SWC experienced the second most severe drought of the 1961-2012 period in 2009. Evident differences existed among the drought conditions in different months, i.e., more severe droughts occurred in February-March 2009, September 2009 to March 2010, and June-October 2011. Based on the annual means over drought regions, the 2009 and 2011 DI (DA) could be attributed to lower P, but the P and ET0 impacts [P, ET0, and P-and-ET0(which reflects drought occurrence due to their combined impacts only)] were comparable in 2010. In addition, P reduction was responsible for DD during 2009-2011. Except in January-March, which were dominated mostly by P, DI (DA) was generally dominated by ET0 (ET0 or P-and-ET0) over the three years. While P dominated spatially and temporally for the majority of the 36 months for DI (DO), some areas were mainly affected by ET0 (ET0 or P-and-ET0). Therefore, to better understand drought evolutions and improve drought monitoring and forecasting, the impacts of ET0 anomalies should be fully considered. The results of this study provide an important reference framework for comprehensively understanding the underlying mechanisms of droughts not only in SWC but also in other regions around the world.

AB Salt dissolved in soil water is transported upward to the soil surface through capillary rise from shallow groundwater, leading to salt accumulation near the surface and salinization of wetlands in arid regions. However, it is not clear how the mechanism and feedback for evapotranspiration induces salt accumulation and precipitation. Here, we developed a model to simulate the transport of water, solutes, and heat, and measured the meteorological, hydrological, and hydraulic parameters of soil using field experiments to calibrate the model for riparian and saltmarsh wetlands in northwestern China. The results showed that the annual atmospheric precipitation averaged 125.3 +/- 10.2 mm in two types of wetlands, the evapotranspiration, depth to the groundwater and soil salinity averaged 587.7 nun yr(-1), 85.4 +/- 5.4 cm and 29.80 g kg(-1) in the riparian wetland, while 637.2 mmyr(-1), 129.7 +/- 15.1 cm and 63.64 g kg(-1) in the saltmarsh wetland, respectively. We found that the flux of liquid water, flux of water vapor, salinity, and efflorescence had maximum values of 1.23 mm day(-1), 0.22 mm day(-1), 104.16 g kg(-1), and 2.10 cm in the riparian wetland, respectively, versus 1.28 mm day(-1), 0.32 mm day(-1), 202.02 g kg(-1), and 3.70 cm in the saltmarsh wetland. Our simulations show that the salinity increases significantly with increasing evapotranspiration, soil temperature, saturated water content, and groundwater depth in the saltmarsh wetland, but that the effects of saturated water content and groundwater depth were small in the riparian wetland. As a result of these factors, the efflorescence pattern exhibited characteristic seasonal and inter-annual variability in which complex interactions among atmospheric precipitation, evapotranspiration, groundwater, and river water provided the long-term driving forces for water flow and salt transport. We found that the increasing efflorescence disrupted evaporation more than sub-florescence, which reduced the soil porosity and possibly affected water vapor transport.

AB For the last several decades, great efforts have been put into converting point precipitation into mean areal precipitation in the design of hydraulic and hydrologic infrastructures. The ratio between point and areal precipitation, called the Areal Reduction Factor (ARF), has been identified to vary significantly depending on a variety of factors, with some factors remaining to be undiscovered. In this paper, we highlight the influence of internal spatial variability of storms on the ARF value. For this, we employ a storm identification algorithm on the radar composite data to identify a total of 54,758 elliptically-shaped extreme storms over the six-year study period. Then, we investigate the relationship between the various storm characteristics to their ARF value. Our findings are as follow: First, we confirm a widely-accepted notion that ARF generally increases with the duration, and it is inversely related to the storm area. Second, we discover that spatial variability within storm, e.g., the coefficient of variation of radar image pixel rainfall values, is a very strong predictor of the ARF value along with area and duration. Last, the difference of ARF values between storms that have elliptical shapes and those that are circular over the same area is about 20% on average. These findings inform that the current design framework of areal rainfall estimation will be improved by incorporating the information on the rainfall spatial variability and storm shape.

AB Information for the interspecific variation in plant stemflow production may provide important implications for their survival in drought conditions. Our objectives were to determine if stemflow generation varied with plant species and to ascertain their possible responses to rainfall characteristics and plant morphology. Stemflow volume (SFv), stemflow depth (SFD), stemflow percentages of gross rainfall (SFD/GR), and funnelling ratio (FR, a quantitative index to evaluate water enrichment by stemflow) were quantified in 2014 and 2015 for coexisting two tree species (Pines tabulifomis and Armeniaca vulgaris) and two shrub species (Salix psammophila and Caragana korshinskii) on the Loess Plateau of China. The results indicated that the generation of stemflow varied significantly among the studied four species. The shrub species had larger values of SFv, SFD , and SFD/GR than tree species. FR values revealed that the soil at the plant bases for P. tabuliformis, A. vulgaris, S. psarrunophila, and C. korshinskii, could receive averages of 13.1-, 23.9-, 78.2-, and 124.9-fold more rainwater, respectively, than an equivalent open area. Characteristics of rainfall had a notable influence on stemflow production. Specifically, SFN, and SFD were all positively and linearly correlated with rainfall in 2014 and 2015. SFD/GR and FR increased linearly with rainfall in 2014, whereas increased exponentially or even decreased after reaching a rainfall threshold in 2015. Significant influence of plant morphology on stemflow production was only observed for P. tabuliformis but not for the other species. In conclusion, the studied two shrub species (S. psammophila and C. korshinskii) were morphologically more effective than the tree species (P. tabuliformis and A. vulgaris) in funnelling rainwater to the soil of the basal area. This could be eco-hydrologically significant for their survival in drought environments.

AB As one of the largest contiguous karst regions in the world, Southwest China is vulnerable to soil erosion because of its unique geology and inappropriate land use. Understanding the linkages between geological conditions, land cover patterns and sediment yield is thus of paramount importance to effectively control sediment delivery in heterogeneous karst watersheds. The objective of this study was to examine how the specific sediment yield was related to lithology and landscape variables for 40 karst watersheds in southwest China. Due to these watershed variables were highly codependent, partial least squares regression (PLSR) was applied to elucidate the relationship between the sediment yield and 30 lithology and landscape variables. The first-order controls were determined by calculating the variable importance for the projection (VIP). Predictors with VIP scores larger than 1 were considered to be the most influential predictors of the PLSR model. Results indicated that the lithology and landscape indeed exerted substantial influence on sediment yield (explained variance: 66.8%) for the investigated 40 watersheds. Specifically, the first dominant factor for sediment yield was karst coverage (VIP = 2.19), followed by dolomite coverage (VIP = 1.42), landscape shape index (VIP = 1.33), patch richness (VIP = 1.23), relative patch richness (VIP = 1.23), number of patches (VIP = 1.22), and Simpson's diversity index (VIP = 1.03). The PLSR technique enabled the elimination of codependency among the variables and facilitated a more unbiased view of the control factors for sediment yield. Therefore, this approach is recommended as a useful tool for identifying the dominant factors controlling sediment yield in heterogeneous karst watersheds.

AB A deterministic geometric approach, the fractal-multifractal (FM) method, is proposed to temporally downscale (disaggregate) rainfall and streamflow records. The applicability of the FM approach is tested on: (1) two sets of rainfall records-one from Laikakota, Bolivia and the other from Tinkham, Washington, USA; and (2) two distinct sets of streamflow records-for water years 2005 and 2008 from the Sacramento River, California, USA. For the purpose of validation, the available daily records are first aggregated into weekly, biweekly, and monthly records and then the FM method is applied to downscale such sets back into the daily scale. The results indicate that the FM method, coupled with a threshold to capture the high intermittency of rainfall and a smoothing parameter to get the milder texture of streamflow, readily generates daily series (over a year) based on weekly, biweekly, and monthly accumulated information, which reasonably preserves the time evolution of the records (especially for streamflow) and captures a variety of key statistical attributes (e.g., autocorrelation, histogram, and entropy). It is argued that the FM deterministic downscalings may enhance and/or supplement available stochastic disaggregation methods.

AB Monthly streamflow prediction can offer important information for optimal management of water resources, flood mitigation, and drought warning. The semi-humid and semi-arid Wei River Basin in China was selected as a case study. In this study, a modified empirical mode decomposition support vector machine (M-EMDSVM) model was proposed to improve monthly streamflow prediction accuracy. The accuracy was improved by introducing polynomial fitting to amend the error caused by the boundary effect existing in the counting process of empirical mode decomposition (EMD). Meanwhile, the computational process of the EMD was analyzed to confirm the decomposition method for the EMD. The root mean square errors, mean absolute error, mean absolute percentage error and Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient were adopted as the standards to evaluate the performance of the artificial neural network (ANN), SVM, WA-SVM, EMD-SVM, and M-EMDSVM models. Meanwhile, the performance of the M-EMDSVM model with different lengths of training dataset was compared and analyzed. Moreover, the monthly streamflow series with various non-stationary levels were simulated to investigate the prediction capacity of the M-EMDSVM model. Results indicated that: (1) the ANN model had the worst performance among the five models at all stations, whereas the EMD-SVM model performed better than the WA-SVM with better metric values; (2) for strong non-stationary series, the performance of the M-EMDSVM model was superior to the EMD-SVM; (3) for weak non-stationary series, the performance of the M-EMDSVM model was similar with the EMD-SVM. Generally, the findings of this study showed that more accurate prediction of strong non-stationary streamflow could be achieved using the proposed modified EMD-SVM model than single SVM model.

AB A fully three dimensional hydrodynamic implicit numerical algorithm has been proposed for simultaneous simulation of fluid density variation and water table gradient in saturated porous media. Unlike the most of the performed researches that primarily restricted to solute transport simulation in confined or unconfined aquifers without proceeding to forecast water table transient situation, the proposed model can truly handle corresponding problems in an unconfined aquifer having sharp water table gradient. The algorithm is based upon a staggered finite volume scheme on an unstructured triangular mesh in the plane and structured grid in vertical that solves the most general form of Darcy equation without limiting assumptions, not expressed as a function of the groundwater potential but presented in term of the water pressure. Avoiding the excessive computational efforts, an efficient and simple algorithm has been proposed to discretize flow equations, track the water table position and determine salinity distribution. A line iterative method has been utilized efficiently, in a way that, resultant linear equations system splits into a series of tri-diagonal square matrix systems whereby the direct together with iterative procedure employed simultaneously to achieve problem unknowns. Prediction of passive scalar salinity quantity has been achieved efficiently by employing the advantageous time splitting algorithm. This has allowed designing and applying different numerical schemes more compatible with the mathematical and physical properties of the corresponding phenomena. Performance of the 3D model has been validated against a range of problems. Comparison between numerical results, analytical solutions, and experimental data demonstrates that the model represents well the simultaneous effects of fluid density variation and water table gradient processes.

AB Many studies have shown that K+ has more favourable effects on soil water infiltration than Na+, which is a result of specific ion effects or Hofmeister effects. In this study, we employed four alkali metal cation species (Li+, Na+, K+, and Cs+) to determine how the particle interactions influence the water infiltration in a soil with permanent surface charges. Moreover, the defined Hofmeister energy was employed to characterize the specific ion effects. The DLVO force plus the hydration force between two adjacent soil particles mainly determines water infiltration rate through affecting the soil pore-size distribution, which exhibits strong specific ion effects. The hydration force may originate from the surface hydration of soil particles and the hydration of cations in the double layer. The hydration pressure between adjacent soil particles was complexly influenced by electrolyte concentration, Debye length, cationic distribution in the double layer through the Hofmeister energy of cation.

AB Various natural and anthropogenic factors affect the formation of gleyed soil. It is a major challenge to identify the key hazard factors and evaluate the dynamic evolutionary process of soil gleyization at a regional scale under future climate change. This study addressed this complex challenge based on regional groundwater modelling for a typical agriculture region located in the Ganjiang River Delta (GRD) of Poyang Lake Basin, China. We first implemented in-situ soil sampling analysis and column experiments under different water depths to examine the statistical relationship between groundwater depth (GD) and gleyization indexes including active reducing substance, ferrous iron content, and redox potential. Subsequently, a three-dimensional groundwater flow numerical model for the GRD was established to evaluate the impacts of the historical average level and future climate change on vadose saturation and soil gleyization (averaged over 2016-2050) in the irrigated farmland. Three climate change scenarios associated with carbon dioxide emission (A1B, A2, and B1) were predicted by the ECHAM5 global circulation model published in IPCC Assessment Report (2007). The ECHAM5 outputs were applied to quantify the variation of groundwater level and to identify the potential maximum gleyed zones affected by the changes of meteorological and hydrological conditions. The results of this study indicate that GD is an indirect indicator for predicting the gradation of soil gleyization at the regional scale, and that the GRD will suffer considerable soil gleyization by 2050 due to fluctuations of the water table induced by future climate changes. Compared with the annually average condition, the climate scenario B1 will probably exacerbate soil gleyization with an 8.8% increase in total gleyed area in GRD. On average, the highly gleyed areas will increase in area by 29.7 km(2), mainly on the riverside area, and the medium-slightly gleyed area will increase by 19.2 km(2) in the middle region.

AB Distributed physically based models (DPMs) have become the standard tool for urban drainage modelling. However, high computational demands limit these in applications where fast or multiple simulations are needed. This paper presents simple fit-for-purpose cheaper-to-run surrogate models (SMs) for pipe network simulations which are validated against a DPM. The SMs are set up by lumping the DPM network into compartments in which the volume of water is governed by mass balances. Outgoing discharges to downstream compartment(s) and surcharging are computed from unambiguous volume-discharge curves. The SMs are applied on a 45 km(2) catchment, Elster Creek in Melbourne, Australia. The number of simulated states and simulation times are reduced by approximately 3 and 6 orders of magnitude, respectively. Different SM complexities are examined. The simplest SM using steady state training data performed well with NSE of 0.98 for volume in the most upstream compartment. When emulating the aggregated surcharge from that compartment, the SM captured all surcharge events correctly. NSE improved from 0.35 to 0.84 when subdividing the compartment into 17 subcompartments. Uncertainty of SM parameters was examined using the Generalized Likelihood Uncertainty Estimation (GLUE) methodology. Two different sampling methods were applied. Limits of acceptability for real-time control, warning and planning, resulted in many accepted models upstream and few to none in downstream backwater-prone areas. All applications showed SM uncertainty bands within expected uncertainty bands for DPM, supporting the use of a simpler conceptual model in fit-for-purpose modelling in urban water systems when computational demands of DPMs are prohibitive.

AB The applicability of the traditionally used overall decomposition-based (ODB) sampling technique in the development of forecasting models is controversial. This study first conducts a systematic investigation of the performance of models developed using the ODB sampling technique. A stepwise decomposition-based (SDB) sampling technique that is consistent with actual forecasting practice is then proposed. Moreover, a novel calibration algorithm that couples a two-stage calibration strategy with a shuffled complex evolutionary approach is formulated to help maintain the performance of models. The application of models produced using these different sampling techniques to four gauging stations in China and Canada indicates that (1) the ODB sampling technique that employ the discrete wavelet transform (DWT), empirical mode decomposition (EMD) and variational mode decomposition (VMD) as series decomposition techniques do not produce convincing forecasting models because additional information on the future streamflow that is to be predicted is introduced into the explanatory variables of the samples; (2) the SDB sampling technique strictly excludes information on future streamfiow from the explanatory variables and is thus as an appropriate alternative for developing forecasting models; (3) the DWT and VMD techniques benefit models by enhancing their performance; on the other hand, the EMD is unsuitable for use in forecasting, due to the variable number of subseries that result from the implementation of the stepwise decomposition strategy. Finally, methods that can be used to enhance the performance of decomposition-based models and the prediction accuracy of nonstationary streamflow are suggested.

AB Uncertainty in simulating hydrologic response to future climate is generally assumed to result from the combined uncertainties of the General Circulation Model (GCM), representative concentration pathway (RCP), downscaling method, and hydrologic model used. However, another source of uncertainty, the observed climate data source used to statistically downscale and bias-correct GCM projections, has largely been overlooked. This study assessed the shifts, variability, and uncertainty in streamflow simulation from three downscaling data sources (NCDC land-based weather stations, NEXRAD spatial grid, and PRISM spatial grid) relative to those introduced by six GCMs and three RCPs in west-central Kansas, U.S. Streamflow simulated by the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) hydrologic model was found to be more sensitive to future precipitation than to maximum and minimum temperatures. The greatest uncertainty in simulated streamflow was associated with selection of the GCM. Uncertainty in simulated streamflow associated with the observed bias-correction data source (NCDC, PRISM, NEXRAD) was greater than with RCPs and was primarily related to uncertainty in precipitation. This study highlighted the importance of recognizing uncertainty from bias-correction data sources in representing future climate scenarios in hydrologic simulations.

AB In mountainous catchments, soil erosion and sediment transport are highly variable throughout time and their quantification remains a major challenge for the scientific community. Understanding the temporal patterns and the main controls of sediment yields in these environments requires a long term monitoring of rainfall, runoff and sediment flux. This paper analyses this type of data collected during 7 years (2007-2014), at the outlet of the Galabre River, a 20 km(2) watershed, in south eastern France, representative of meso-scale Mediterranean mountainous catchments.
   This study is based on a hybrid approach using continuous turbidity records and automated total suspended solid sampling to quantify the instantaneous suspended sediment concentrations (SSC), sediment fluxes, event loads and yields. The total suspended sediment yield was 4661 Mg km(-2) and was observed during flood events. The two crucial periods for suspended sediment transport at the outlet were June and November/December (63% of the total). The analysis of suspended sediment transport dynamics observed during 236 flood events highlighted their intermittency and did not show any clear relationship between rainfall, discharge and SSC. The most efficient floods were characterised by counter-clockwise hysteresis relationships between SSC and discharges. The floods with complex hysteresis were the more productive in the long term, during this measuring period exceeding a decade. Nevertheless, the current research outlines the need to obtain medium-term (five years) continuous time series to assess the range of variations of suspended sediment fluxes and to outline clearly the seasonality of suspended sediment yields. Results suggest the occurrence of a temporal dis-connectivity in meso-scale catchments over short time-scales between the meteorological forcing and the sediment yields estimated at the outlet. These findings have important methodological impacts for modelling and operational implications for watershed management.

AB A storm, composed of two delayed cells, hit the Monte Antelao slopes (Dolomites, North Eastern Italy) in the early morning of July 18th, 2009. The resulting runoff triggered two consecutive debris flows along the Rovina di Cancia channel. The detailed topographic data collected before and just after this event allowed an accurate reconstruction of the morphological changes experienced by the channel bed. These data are here used as benchmark to test the ability of numerical models to reproduce the dynamics of a real event, taking into account the morphology changes of the channel bed. The aim is to provide an efficient model for engineering applications on large scales, such as those required by debris flow hazard assessment. A rainfall-runoff transformation is applied to reconstruct the solid-liquid hydrograph needed for computing the debris flow propagation. Two routing models are used: a GIS-based movable bed model, and a widely used fixed bed model (FLO-2D). Although similar results are obtained in terms of areas subjected to deposition, significant differences emerge in terms of mobilized volumes. Only the simulation of both the deposition and entrainment processes allows to reliably reproduce the sediment volumes estimated from the pre- and post-event topographic data. This information is fundamental in any hazard assessment because the volume of sediment mobilized by debris flow events exerts a fundamental control on the extension of areas subjected to inundation and on the thickness of sediment deposits. The capability to reproduce correctly the mobilized volumes also entails a more reliable simulation of the evolution of the peak and volume of the solid-liquid hydrograph as the debris flow propagates downstream, allowing the identification of the channel reach where banks could be overflowed. Conversely, adopting a fixed bed model leads mainly to an underestimation of the both the transported sediments volumes and the area subjected to deposition. As a consequence, the maximum debris flow depth in the portion of the channel subjected to erosion is underestimated and that in the portion of the channel subjected to deposition is overestimated. All these types of information are of great importance for an effective hazard assessment.

AB Hydrological drought is increasing under the impact of global change, which could have serious influences on the stability of ecological systems and water-dependent human activities in the affected regions. In this study, the total water storage (TWS) derived from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellites from 2003 to 2012 was downscaled to a finer resolution by incorporating the output from a land surface model. The downscaled data was used to identify hydrological drought for eight tributaries of the Yangtze River in China. The trend in the water storage deficit based on the downscaled GRACE data ranged from -0.86 to 0.29 mm month(-1) for the eight tributaries from 2003 to 2012, among which the absolute largest value occurred in the Poyang Lake Basin. The eight tributaries experienced between four and seven hydrological droughts during the study period, and droughts in 2003, 2006 and 2011 occurred in all of the tributaries. The drought recovery rate for the eight tributaries was between 4.5 and 7.2 mm month(-1), and the average drought recovery time was between 3.6 and 5.7 months. Tributaries with a high climate moisture index had low frequencies of drought occurrence but had long drought durations and large drought severities, resulting in long drought recovery times. Additionally, the impacts of human activity on hydrologic processes intensified significantly from 2003 to 2012, such as water storage in reservoirs and water consumption, leading to spatial differences in regional drought characterizations. The results are useful for the understanding of the mechanism of hydrological drought formation and the extension of GRACE applications in medium and small-scale catchments.

TI Cumulative effects of cascade dams on river water cycle: Evidence from

AB Cascade dams are known to influence the river water cycle, but their cumulative effects (CEs) are still not well understood. Water hydrogen (H) and oxygen (O) isotopes are hypothesized to be used to characterize the CEs. To test this hypothesis, we investigated water delta D, delta O-18, and related environmental factors in cascade reservoirs on the Wujiang River, Southwest China. The delta D and delta O-18 ranged from -64.2 parts per thousand to -45.4 parts per thousand and from -9.7 parts per thousand to -6.8 parts per thousand, respectively, and showed obvious temporal and spatial variations. Water temperature is an important factor influencing these variations. After damming, an increase of water retention time caused the enrichment of heavy H-O isotopes in reservoir surface water, and thermal stratification induced a decrease of delta D and delta O-18 with depth. Due to bottom discharge, released water showed more negative delta D and delta O-18 than reservoir surface water, and these delta D and delta O-18 differences were controlled by water retention time and mean water depth of the reservoir. Overall, the CEs of cascade dams caused delta D and delta O-18 to display a jagged increase from upstream to downstream in the impounded Wujiang River. Therefore H-O isotopes can be used to estimate the CEs of cascade dams. As cascade dams can modify H-O isotope signatures, caution should be exercised when using H and O isotopes to trace the source of the impounded river water.

AB We analyzed the relationships between meteorological drought and hydrological drought using very dense and diverse network of gauged natural drainage basins across the conterminous U.S. Specifically, this work utilized a dataset of 289 gauging stations, covering the period 1940-2013. Drainage basins were obtained for each gauging station using a digital terrain model. In addition to meteorological data (e.g., precipitation, air temperature and the atmospheric evaporative demand), we obtained a number of topographic, soil and remote sensing variables for each defined drainage basin. A hydrological drought index (the Standardized Streamflow Index; SSI) was computed for each basin and linked to the Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI), which was used as a metric of climatic drought severity. The relationships between different SPEI time-scales and their corresponding SSI were assessed by means of a Pearson correlation coefficient. Also, the general patterns of response of hydrological droughts to climatic droughts were identified using a principal component analysis. Overall, results demonstrate a positive response of SSI to SPEI at shorter time-scales, with strong seasonality and clear spatial differences. We also assessed the role of some climatic and environmental factors in explaining these different responses using a predictive discriminant analysis. Results indicate that elevation and vegetation coverage are the main drivers of the diverse response of SSI to SPEI time-scales. Similar analyses were made for three sub-periods (1940-1964, 1965-1989 and 1989-2013), whose results confirm considerable differences in the response of SSI to SPEI over the past eighty years.

AB Green Infrastructure (GI) is considered to be an innovative stormwater management approach that offers numerous other environmental benefits including reduction in air pollution and climate change mitigation compared with conventional gray infrastructures, and it has been gradually accepted and used worldwide. This review mainly focuses on the hydrological aspect of GI and provides a summary of the knowledge about GI as a stormwater management alternative. In this review, we discuss the operating mechanisms of a few widely-used GIs in the aspect of stormwater management. We critically examine policies for promoting GI implementation in some countries, including the sponge city in China and water sensitive urban design (WSUD) in Australia, and review the effectiveness of GI on treating stormwater quantity in real world applications. In addition, we also used Bibliometrics to analyze the GI research trends and found GI has been popular in an increasing number of countries and regions, which China has the greatest future growth potential in GIs research. Moreover, many barriers impeding the further development of GI and strategies to overcome these barriers are also summarized. This review gathers knowledge from many sources to provide an overview of GI to better understand its mechanisms and applications, and to highlight the areas that require future study.

AB The net amount of rainfall entering into the soil and its spatial distribution at the patch scale are key drivers of ecosystem processes in drylands. The spatial distribution of water is mainly controlled by vegetation canopy which determines the partitioning of rainfall into interception, throughfall and stemflow. In this paper, we synthesized and analyzed rainfall partitioning for 68 woody plant species in drylands (delimited by a rainfall-potential evapotranspiration ratio < 0.65; 46 papers). We explored the role of rainfall inputs and plant morphological attributes (life form, phenology, leaf type and bark type) by considering a rainfall gradient from 145 to 805 mm year(-1). On average, interception, throughfall and stemflow accounted for 24.0, 69.8 and 6.2% of total rainfall, respectively. Stemflow was the most variable flux (coefficient of variation = 107.8%), while interception and throughfall were less variable fluxes (coefficient of variation = 39.2 and 20.4%, respectively). Along the increasing rainfall gradient, interception showed a tendency to decrease from 27.1 to 18.9% (p = 0.12), throughfall increased from 61.4 to 81.2% (p < 0.01) and stemflow decreased from 10.0 to 1.6% (p < 0.0001). Shrubs presented higher stemflow than trees (9.4% vs. 3.5%, respectively; p < 0.0001), while trees presented higher throughfall than shrubs (72.3% vs. 63.0%, respectively; p < 0.05). Species with smooth barks presented higher stemflow than species with rough barks (8.3% vs. 4.2%, respectively; p < 0.0001). Both phenology and leaf type had no effect on interception, throughfall and stemflow (p > 0.05 for all cases). Shrubs were more abundant towards the dry edge of the rainfall gradient (145-500 mm year(-1)), while trees were more abundant towards the subhumid edge (500-805 mm year(-1)). These results suggested that higher stemflow found towards the dry edge of the rainfall gradient was caused by the higher abundance of shrubs, which generated more stemflow than trees. Our findings highlighted the ecohydrological key role of vegetation life form and rainfall inputs affecting the amount of water entering into the soil and its spatial distribution in drylands.

AB Streamflow is typically divided into two components for hydrograph separation, quickflow and baseflow. Baseflow is the portion of streamflow that contains groundwater flow and flow from other delayed sources and is of key importance for river basin ecology and water resources planning and management. The BaseFlow Index (BFI) is defined as the ratio of long-term mean baseflow to total streamflow. Knowledge of the BFI is not directly available for ungauged catchments and hence for most of the terrestrial land surface. In this study, the BFI was determined for all river reaches in New Zealand. First a recursive digital filtering technique was applied to separate baseflow from total streamflow for 482 gauged sites across New Zealand, whereby an individual filter parameter was determined for each catchment. Based on the baseflow and total streamflow data the long-term BFI for each gauged site was determined, as well as seasonal values of BFI. BFI varies between 0.20 and 0.96 with an average of 0.53, which indicates that 53% of long-term streamflow in New Zealand is likely to originate from groundwater discharge and other delayed sources. Long-term BFI values for all river reaches that comprise the New Zealand river network were predicted using the random forest technique. Furthermore, the winter to summer BFI for all river reaches in New Zealand were also determined. Distinct spatial patterns of the BFI were identified. While the spatial distribution and the magnitude of the BFI was determined by a combination of factors, certain patterns can be attributed to geological formations in New Zealand, namely the volcanic plateau region and the Southern Alps. While the dataset determined in this work can support work specifically pertaining to water resources planning and management in New Zealand, in particular water supply, stream ecology and pollution risk, the methodology devised to calculate the BFI for gauged sites and to predict the BFI for ungauged sites is applicable to any region around the world.

AB Typhoon Haiyan made landfall in the central Philippines on 8 November 2013 as one of the strongest tropical cyclones ever. It also affected a 23-year-old multi-species 'reforest' at Manobo near Tacloban City on Leyte Island. As part of a larger hydrological investigation of the impacts of reforestation on streamfiow response in the Tacloban area, gross rainfall (P), throughfall (TF; 24 roving collectors) and stemflow (SF; 12 trees) were monitored at Manobo between June 2013 and May 2014. Leaf Area Index (LAI) above each TF collector was measured regularly. Total rainfall interception losses (I) were determined using Gash's revised analytical model for three consecutive periods:(i) pre-Haiyan (baseline), (ii) post-Haiyan (damaged canopy), and (iii) after initial canopy recovery. Modeled I was 18% of P before disturbance, 12% for the period with the most extensive canopy damage, and 17.5% after initial canopy recovery. Stemflow was low, and weighted mean values accounted for 2.7%, 1.3% and 2.0% of P for the respective periods. Contrasts in period-average values of I reflected changes in LAI as well as wet-canopy evaporation rates. Storm-based TF fractions at the 5 m x 5 m sub-plot scale were inversely related to LAI, especially for small storms and low rainfall intensities. Inferred hourly rates of wet-canopy evaporation showed a strong positive relationship to hourly rainfall intensity during large storms. The revised analytical model was also run using pre-disturbance parameter values for the entire year to assess the overall effect of canopy damage on L. Estimated annual losses with and without canopy disturbance were 514 mm (15% of P) and 572 mm (17%), respectively. Thus, observed and inferred changes in rainfall partitioning after canopy disturbance and initial recovery were comparatively modest, likely because the measurement site was relatively sheltered from the winds during typhoon passage and re-foliation relatively rapid. However, given the predicted increase in occurrence of 'super-typhoons' due to continued global warming and oceanic freshening, the structure of forests in affected regions can be expected to be modified, with potential consequences for rainfall partitioning and hydrological response.

AB Understanding variations in soil moisture and soil water potential is important for describing hydrological processes at the hillslope scale. An intensive field campaign to measure soil moisture, soil water potential, and rainfall events was performed at many locations and depths to obtain seasonal and spatial distributions of hydrometric measurements along steep hillslopes. Soil moisture and soil water tension analysis showed seasonally distinctive features in statistics and probability distributions. The relationship between soil moisture and soil water tension was explored to characterize seasonal and spatial variations. The recession slopes of soil moisture at several given points of the relationship were also seasonally different. The Brooks and Corey model and the van Genuchten model were used to estimate parameters for the measured data to explain the spatial and seasonal variations. Soil water storage analysis not only indicated that lateral flow tends to be abundant at greater depths but also revealed a seasonal trend in development of subsurface flow in the downslope direction. The combined impact of topography and vegetation determined the seasonal differences in hydrometric responses along the hillslope locations.

AB To better understand the biogeochemical processes of iron, sulfur, and phosphorus and their coupled relationships, we used the in situ high-resolution diffusive gradients in thin films (DGT) technique to characterize labile Fe, S, and P in the sediment porewater of a mangrove coast in the Jiulong River Estuary, China. The distributions of DGT-labile Fe and S indicated that microbial sulfate reduction (MSR) and microbial iron reduction (MIR) exhibited an intense competitive relationship and temperature-dependent behavior. Thus, in addition to the expected MSR, MIR is an important or even predominant biogeochemical process for organic matter (OM) mineralization in this Fe-rich mangrove coast. Labile Fe, S, and P distributions and variations demonstrate that Fe redox cycling plays a crucial role in regulating P behavior and P cycling. An additional new finding is that the flux of labile S in the intertidal zone increases during flood tides and decreases during ebb tides, indicating that the formation and reoxidation of sulfide in surface layers are regulated by tide-induced redox changes. The net P flux associated with recirculated seawater was estimated to range from -0.306 +/- 0.001 to 0.343 +/- 0.013 mmol m(-2) d(-1) in the winter survey, suggesting that sediment porewater tends to be a P source in the subtidal zone and a P sink in the intertidal zone for the overlying seawater in winter. The continuous accumulation of labile P in surface sediment could be intensively released into the overlying seawater through prevailing MIR process in the subsequent riverine flood season, which may promote eutrophication of the adjacent Xiamen Bay.

AB Outcrop analogs for aquifers allow measurements of permeability with relatively high-resolution and mapping sedimentary unit types. The spatial bivariate structure of permeability is defined by aquifer architecture. The architecture is often organized into a hierarchy of unit types, and associated permeability modes, across different spatial scales. The composite covariance (or semivariogram) is a linear summation of the auto- and cross-covariances (or semivariograms) of unit types defined at smaller scales, weighted by the related proportions and transition probabilities. It is well-known that an appreciable fraction of the composite variance arises from differences in mean permeability across unit types defined at smaller scales. Previous work has shown that the transition probabilities usually define the spatial bivariate correlation structure. The composite spatial bivariate statistics for permeability (covariance or semivariogram) will not be representative unless data locations allow proper definition of the transition probabilities of the units. Quantification of the stratal architecture can be used to better interpret the transition probabilities and thereby improve a model for the sample covariance and semivariogram. In this paper, we use an inverse modeling algorithm to fit the components of the hierarchical model, written as nested functions, in developing a hierarchical spatial correlation models. Specifically, the least-squares criterion along with prior information and other weighted constraints are used as the objective function for the inverse problem, which is solved by the Gauss-Newton-Levenberg-Marquardt method. The estimated covariance and transition probability models provides accurate representation of the spatial correlation structure of permeability for field-measured data from in Espanola Basin, New Mexico.

AB Uncertainty is a defining characteristic of hydrologic investigations, with increasing recognition of parameter, structural, measurement, and prediction uncertainty. Here we suggest that an additional form of uncertainty-(geo)political uncertainty-is locally important, but commonly neglected. We define geopolitical uncertainty in hydrology as indefiniteness of water balance processes, the relative magnitude of hydrologic fluxes, or causality as a consequence of complex international relations amongst riparians of a transboundary basin forced by internal economic, political, and nationalistic drivers (as well as interactions amongst these drivers) under a regime of non-stationary climate. We suggest that such (geo)political uncertainty has developed in the Jordan River basin as a consequence of intentionally ambiguous language in the Israel Jordan Peace Treaty, outstanding discussions regarding water allocations to the Palestinian Authority, and lobbying by the powerful agricultural sector. In the presence of economic motives requiring consumption of water these drivers promote securitization manifested as secrecy regarding water management and consumption by the upstream riparian, which given non-stationary climate opens a void of (geo)political uncertainty in which the relative importance of climate variability and change becomes indeterminate relative to changing water consumption, thereby perhaps allowing the upstream riparian to increase water consumption. The consequence of this (geo) political uncertainty for hydrologic studies is large water balance uncertainty, inability to reproduce water consumption studies due to data secrecy, and disagreement regarding the relative importance of pertinent drivers (i.e., climate versus consumption). Greater acknowledgement and awareness of (geo)political uncertainty's impacts on hydrologic studies is needed, as are concerted efforts to reduce this uncertainty for the benefit of transparent water dialogue among riparians and knowledge-based management of common-pool resources.

AB The potential of aggregation-decomposition (AGDP) for flood control of mixed reservoir system remains unclear due to the flood variability and complex hydraulic connections. In this study, we develop flood classification-aggregation-decomposition (FAD) operating rules to adapt for flood variability and to account for the trade-offs between flood loss of the tributaries and that of the mainstream. Three steps are involved in the proposed FAD operating rules: (1) flood classification by projection pursuit (PP) coupled with genetic algorithm (GA); (2) definition of FAD operating rules using the AGDP model coupled with piecewise linear function based on flood classification; and (3) optimization of FAD operating rules by parameterization-simulation-optimization (PSO). A case study is performed with a large-scale mixed reservoir system in the Xijiang river basin (China) in three scenarios: conventional operation for the status quo year (CO-SQY), conventional operation for the perspective year 2030 (CO-2030) and FAD operation for the perspective year 2030 (FAD-2030). The results clearly show that flood classification enables reservoir operating rules to better adapt for flood variability, and the FAD operating rules in the scenario of FAD-2030 outperform the conventional operating rules in the scenarios of CO-SQY and CO-2030, as it considers flood variability and the trade-offs between flood loss of the tributaries and that of the mainstream.

AB This study examined the role of tree arrangement (random versus aligned) on the drag forces and velocity inside a 1/12th-scale model mangrove forest over a range of tree density (trees m(-2)). Each model tree included an aerial root system geometrically similar to Rhizophora, with maximum root height HRmax and water depth H > HRmax The non-dimensional root density was defined as a(r) HRmax with root zone frontal area per volume, a(r). For both random and aligned low-density forests, a(r) HRmax  < 0.1, the vertical profile of velocity followed a boundary layer shape. Within both random and aligned high-density forests, a(r) > 0.1, the velocity was diminished in the root zone (z < HRmax) and enhanced above the root zone, relative to the boundary layer profile. For all forest arrangements, the force on the roots dominated the force on the entire tree, even in cases with diminished velocity within the root zone. Compared with a tree at the leading edge, a tree inside a randomly distributed forest could experience either a greater or lesser force, and the variation in drag force increased with tree density. In contrast, for an aligned distribution of trees the force on an individual tree within the forest was always diminished relative to a tree at the leading edge. A drag coefficient was defined using a quadratic drag law. The forest-average drag coefficient, defined using the channel-average velocity, was up to 30 percent higher for random tree arrangements, compared to in-line tree arrangements.

AB The Pearl River Delta (PRD) is one of the most economically dynamic regions of China and has experienced rapid urbanization during the past decades. in this study, the effect of urbanization on summer rainfall events in the PRD region is investigated using the advanced Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model. Two comparative urban scenarios (2015 and 1991) were designed to test the sensitivity of summer rainfall to urbanization. The results indicate that the WRF model reasonably reproduces the general synoptic weather pattern, particularly for air temperature and relative humidity. Further comparative analysis reveals that extreme rainfall significantly increased in urban areas, while the total summer rainfall slight decreased. Urbanization causes changes in the surface energy balance, resulting in more sensible heat flux and less latent heat flux. The decreased latent heat flux dampens the moisture availability and results in the decline of the maximum convective available potential energy, which lead to the decrease of the total summer rainfall. In contrast, the increased sensible heat flux enhances the urban surface temperature and boundary layer circulations (e.g., elevated planetary boundary layer height and higher level of free convection and lifted condensation level) and carries more water mixing vapor into the atmosphere over urban areas, enhancing the frequency and intensity of extreme rainfall. The results suggest that urbanization plays an important role in the urban change of summer rainfall and causes more extreme rainfall events, thereby inducing flooding and property losses associated with large economic costs.

   STRATEGY
AB Hydrological model parameters are essential for model simulation, which may vary with time owing to climatic variations and human activities. As a result, the implementation of stationary parameters may lead to inaccurate streamflow simulation. Actual evapotranspiration (ET) is a crucial component of hydrological cycles with an important influence on regional climate characteristics. Our aim was to investigate an appropriate way to estimate time-varying parameters using streamflow and ET observations, and to explore the how the simulation efficiency would change when ET data were added into assimilation. Data assimilation techniques can automatically adjust hydrological model parameters according to changing conditions. The ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) technique was used to assimilate observations into a two-parameter monthly water balance model. Four data assimilation schemes were designed and applied in a synthetic experiment and 173 catchments in USA, including: (1) sole assimilation of streamflow to update both parameters, (2) joint assimilation of streamflow and ET to simultaneously update parameters, (3) sole assimilation of ET first to update parameter C (measuring evapotranspiration), and then subsequently joint assimilation of streamflow and ET to update parameter SC (measuring water storage capacity), and (4) sole assimilation of ET to update parameter C, and then sole assimilation of streamflow to update parameter SC. The four schemes were compared in terms of deterministic and probabilistic model performances, and model parameter correlations. The results indicated that: (1) the estimation of parameter C can be improved by assimilating ET observations into the model, and the time-varying model parameters obtained by adding ET data into assimilation led to a significant enhancement in deterministic streamflow and ET prediction, (2) among the three joint assimilation schemes, the deterministic model simulation performances were similar, while the ensemble predictions were more reliable in scheme 2. The joint assimilation of streamflow and ET to update both parameters in one step, i.e., scheme 2, outperformed the other two schemes in parameter SC estimation and model performance, (3) the ability to enhance simulation accuracy and to weaken correlations between parameters was more significant in humid catchments. The joint assimilation was helpful for the application of multiple sources of information into a hydrological simulation.

AB Flood risk management is gradually shifting from a risk-based approach to an integrated one that, among other elements, considers risk communication (RC) as a means of boosting resilience. Regardless of the above, few scientists have tackled up to now the integration of RC into flood risk management. In this connection, this particular study seeks to check out the potential of a risk dialogue approach (based on an ad hoc RC strategy) to change attitudes and behaviours in relation to flash flood risk. Via a pre-post survey design, we evaluated risk perception and awareness regarding a Civil Protection Plan (CPP) implemented locally (i.e., in the municipality of Navaluenga, central Spain). For this particular objective, a questionnaire survey was created, and 201 adults (representing more than 10% of the population census) were interviewed twice in a one-year period. Before the second survey, an RC strategy was created. The RC strategy comprised briefings, quiz answers, storytelling, a contest of videos and photographs about past floods, and an intergenerational workshop. A t-test for paired sample analyses and a general linear model (GLM) repeated measures ANOVA were applied to identify changes in risk perception and awareness. Our results indicate that the RC strategy did increase flood risk perception in Navaluenga in the long term (lifetime). Also, it increased the level of awareness of the various features that comprise the CPP, enabling people to be more competent in facing a flash flood. Some cognitive biases detected in the perceptual process of human beings may shed some light on the results obtained. The implementation of well-thought-out RC strategies can play a role in improving resilience, particularly in geographic areas such as the Iberian Peninsula, in which climate change scenarios indicate a likely increase in the severity and frequency of flooding.

TI Exploiting the spatial pattern of daily precipitation in the analog
   method for regional temporal disaggregation
SO JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY

   precipitation; Weather types; Spatial and temporal coherence; French

ID RAINFALL; TIME
AB The analog method relies on the subdaily distribution of analog days - also called fragments - to perform temporal disaggregation. The features that serve to define analog days are generally at the daily scale although they are assumed to convey information on the subdaily scale. In most cases, the only feature used is the daily total at the location of interest. Features pertaining to the synoptic circulation are also often used although with the purpose of increasing the spatial rather than the temporal resolution. Precipitation is conditioned not only on synoptic circulation but also on regional features such as orography. This combined effect is reflected on the spatial pattern of daily precipitation. We propose to rely on descriptions of the spatial pattern to select analog days in order to perform temporal disaggregation. Three analog method variants based on different sets of spatial pattern features, a variant that rely on synoptic circulation alone and a variant that combines synoptic circulation with spatial pattern features are evaluated and compared. All the features considered characterize a region therefore the same analog day is employed at all the locations within the region. Inter-site coherence is thus enforced. A leave-one-out procedure is carried out on hourly radar precipitation reanalyses covering a mountainous watershed in the French Mediterranean on a 1 km(2) grid over the period 1997-2006. Uncertainty is taken into account by generating five realizations of each variant. Performance is measured in terms of return levels (1-20 years) at various temporal scales (1 h to 12 h) and at two spatial scales - grid box and watershed. The proposed regional approach to temporal disaggregation globally preserves inter-site coherence. This can be seen from the relatively good reproduction of the regional pattern of return levels of the study area by all variants. Synoptic circulation conveys less information on the subdaily scale than spatial pattern features. The variant that depends on synoptic circulation alone largely overestimates return levels especially at lower temporal scales (1 h and 3 h). Combining synoptic circulation with spatial pattern features yielded no significant improvement.

AB Biocrust effects on soil water infiltration and hydropedological processes have attracted increasing attention in dryland ecosystems, but are nevertheless subjected to great controversy. According to some scholars, infiltration was assumed to decrease due to repellency and to increase with the organic matter content due to its role in increasing aggregate stability and porosity. These assumptions were checked in our study on the Loess Plateau of China. By using double-ring and disc infiltrometers, the infiltration curves of cyanobacteria and moss biocrusts as well as on bare soil were continuously measured, and the characteristics of water infiltration on biocrust-covered soil and its correlations with soil properties were analyzed. Our results showed that the cyanobacteria and moss biocrusts had significantly lower constant infiltration rates under ponding conditions (0.265 and 0.180 cm min(-1), respectively) as compared with the bare sand (0.372 cm min(-1)), and they took significantly more time (41% and 105%) and water (14% and 73%) to reach steady-state infiltration. Similarly, the saturated hydraulic conductivities of the cyanobacteria and moss biocrusts were 39% (0.514 cm min(-1)) and 65% (0.295 cm min(-1)) lower than that of the bare sand (0.839 cm min(-1)), respectively. More importantly, biocrust infiltrability was closely related with biocrust characteristics and soil properties, especially particle-size distribution and crust thickness. Contrary to some assumptions that attributed impeded infiltration to crust repellency, and increased infiltration to the role played by OM, both variables could not have explained the current results. Under tension and ponding conditions, cyanobacteria and moss biocrusts were found to greatly reduce surface soil infiltrability and impede soil water infiltration. These findings should be considered for future analyses of hydropedological processes in arid and semiarid regions.

AB Net primary production (NPP) is one of the most important components in the carbon cycle of terrestrial ecosystems. Climatic and hydrologic elements are among the primary factors controlling the dynamics of NPP at global and regional scales. Thus, understanding the interactions between them is of great importance for optimal ecosystem management. This study aimed to investigate the spatiotemporal change in NPP and its responses to both climatic and hydrologic factors in a semiarid watershed-the Upper reach of the Wei River Basin (UWRB)-on the Loess Plateau, China. To this end, an integrated hydro-biogeochemical model (SWAT-DayCent) was applied to examine NPP during the period 1987-2016. The results show that the SWAT-DayCent performed well in simulating both the hydrologic and the biogeochemical components in this typical loess watershed. Though the basin average NPP increased slightly during the recent 30 years (1987-2016), the spatial distribution varied significantly in the region, with a relatively higher level in the southeastern and western parts and a lower level in the northern part. The strongly positive responses of major vegetations to precipitation indicate that precipitation was the dominant factor driving the ecosystem production, whereas warming may exert negative effects, especially in the southeastern part of the UWRB. Further, the strongly positive relationships between NPP and soil water/ET also suggest that the ecosystem production relied heavily on the water availability, indicating a tightly-coupled water-carbon cycle in this region. Overall, our findings are of great importance for identifying the key driving forces of the ecosystem production and the interaction between water and carbon cycles. The study may also aid policymakers in seeking better eco-environmental management when facing the climate change on the Loess Plateau.

AB This paper demonstrated the benefits of statistical methods when investigating the climatic and non-climatic drivers responsible for variations in groundwater recharge with a series of up to 43 years of annual recharge for 426 bores in South-East South Australia. We identified the factors influencing groundwater recharge based on 71 climatic metrics and 17 non-climatic metrics (including groundwater abstraction). The results showed: (1) Rainfall during April to October was the most important variable influencing recharge temporal variation, with its decline identified as the most significant factor related to recharge reduction; (2) In contrast, a negative correlation between rainfall during December to February (DJF) and annual groundwater recharge was found. This suggests that a seasonal shift in rainfall (such as decreasing rainfall during April to October and an increase during DJF) can result in a decline in recharge even when the annual rainfall remains unchanged; (3) The length of wet spells (consecutive rain days) and increasing potential evapotranspiration (PET) were additional significant predictors for recharge temporal variation. It demonstrated that a simple empirical relationship (such as recharge as a fixed percentage of rainfall) is not a reliable estimation of renewable groundwater resources under changing climatic conditions; (4) There is a statistically significant correlation between mean groundwater depth and recharge, which implies that if groundwater level fall due to rainfall declines then a positive feedback loop can lead to further recharge declines; (5) Spatially the most statistically significant factors influencing groundwater recharge were soil types and land attributes. The findings of this study can identify which stressors should be included when investigating the impact of climate change on groundwater recharge.

AB For both physical and economic reasons, water scarcity has become a worldwide concern. To meet regional water demands and improve water resource optimization management, a multi-objective water resource allocation model was developed for a sustainable future, in which equity, efficiency, and sustainability were taken as the allocation principles to equitably maximize subarea economic and social welfare and coordinate social development and water management without compromising water ecosystem sustainability. To meet the water resource needs of both present and future generations, intra- and intergenerational equities were integrated using a Gini coefficient and a modified Bentham-Rawls criterion to allow for time and space social equity trade-offs for sustainable water allocation. To coordinate social development and water management for water sustainability, mean economic benefit efficiency was considered in the multi-objective water resource allocation model. By factoring in the competition between present and future generations, the ecological water requirements, and the fuzzy random water resource parameters, the optimal strategy better depicts a pattern of water inter-temporal configuration than current strategies. A case study from the upper reaches of the Minjiang River basin in China is given to demonstrate the practicality and rationality of the proposed model. Compared with previous models, the intergenerational allocation model was found to effectively consider sustainable water resource utilization, had a higher total social welfare value, and guaranteed equitable intra-generational water allocation. Based on the results and discussion, some management recommendations for water resource allocation strategies integrated intergenerational equity, and policy support are given.

AB To improve understanding of spatial, seasonal, and inter-annual variations in nitrate sources and in-stream processes in the Illinois River system, nitrate concentrations and isotopic compositions were measured in 445 water samples collected over a four-year period (2004-2008) from the Upper Illinois River Basin (UIRB). Samples included surface water in the river and major tributaries, effluent samples from Chicago's largest wastewater treatment plant (WTP), and representative groundwater from shallow wells in agricultural land. Two principal nitrate endmember sources within the UIRB had distinctive isotopic compositions: WTP effluent with delta N-15 = 8.6 +/- 1.7 parts per thousand and delta O-15 = 0.8 +/- 1.4 parts per thousand and agricultural groundwater with delta N-15-NO3 = 3.4 +/- 0.6 parts per thousand and delta O-18 = 3.7 +/- 0.5 parts per thousand (when minimally affected by nitrate reduction). Isotopic data indicated that the large pulse of nitrate exported from the river basin during the spring was mostly derived from agricultural land drainage, while nitrate from large WTP effluent point sources was predominant in the upper reaches of the river near Chicago. During low base-flow conditions in late-summer and fall, the agricultural nitrate source was greatly diminished and the headwater WTP source was predominant in the river basin export. Our results indicated biogeochemical nitrate reduction and isotopic fractionation occurred within the river network, affecting both agricultural and urban sources during surface-water transport. In addition, diminished agricultural nitrate export was attributable to preferential discharge of biogeochemically reduced groundwater during low base flow. Isotopic indicators of spatial and seasonal variations in the relative importance of different nitrate sources, and their relative susceptibility to natural attenuation, might be useful for guiding monitoring and management practices to reduce nitrate export from complex watersheds with mixed land uses.

TI Revisiting the modified Hvorslev formula to account for the dynamic

AB Estimating streambed hydraulic conductivity is particularly important in arid and semi-arid regions, where surface water infiltration from ephemeral dryland streams helps maintain riparian ecosystems. In situ permeameter tests are widely used to estimate the hydraulic conductivity of streambed sediments. Previous studies have demonstrated that one of the major factors controlling spatiotemporal variations in streambed hydraulic conductivity in such areas is streambed clogging by suspended sediments. Recently, a modified Hvorslev (1951) formula was theoretically proposed to account for the effect of streambed clogging on streambed hydraulic properties due to suspended particle sedimentation during falling-head tests. To validate the modified formula, fieldwork was conducted at five sites in the lower Heihe River, a typical intermittent river of north-western China, in September 2017. A simple PVC pipe with an inner diameter of 4 cm was used as a permeameter for the field tests. Both muddy river water and clean water were used to fill the permeameter to conduct comparative tests. To differentiate the interpretation of the field testing data obtained with clean water, the data obtained with muddy river water were analysed with an equation considering an iteratively increasing total hydraulic resistance of riverbed sediments due to the effects of riverbed clogging. The estimated vertical hydraulic conductivity for the top 0.3 m of riverbed sediments varied from 1 to 41 m/day. The proposed model was shown to accurately estimate the hydraulic conductivity of riverbed sediments using both clean and muddy water during slug tests.

AB Evapotranspiration was determined to be hydrological effect which induces suction. Evapotranspiration induced suction governs the slope stability, ground water recharge and runoff. This study focuses on suction induced in root zone of mix grass used in green infrastructure. Most of the previous studies focused on evapotranspiration induced suction less than 100 kPa measured using tensiometers. However, for investigating the drought condition, it is essential to obtain suction data greater than 100 kPa. It was noted that the response of plant parameters such as stomatal conductance and surface area were not considered holistically evapotranspiration induced suction. The main objective of this study is to investigate relationship among evapotranspiration induced suction, stomatal conductance and surface area for a mix grass species used in green infrastructure subjected to drought stress (corresponds to suction > 100 kPa). Stomatal conductance was observed to increase up to suction (6 +/- 1 kPa) corresponding to volumetric field capacity. Thereafter, large decrease (more than 90%) in stomatal conductance was found with an increase in suction. Stomatal conductance was found to be 0 at 2431 kPa (i.e., wilting point). Change in normalized surface areas of mix grass was found to be relatively low (within +/- 15%) with an increase in suction up to 138 kPa. However, beyond 138 kPa, it varied drastically (by 31-68%) with an increase in suction from 138 kPa to 3642 kPa. Two new relationships i.e., Stomatal conductance characteristic curve (SCCC) and surface area characteristic curve (SACC) were proposed. Therefore, the relationships developed in current study help to analyze the performance of green infrastructure accurately.

AB Periphyton is important to lake ecosystems, contributing to primary production, nutrient cycling, and benthic metabolism. Increases in periphyton growth in lakes can be indicative of changes in water quality, shifts in ecosystem structure, and increases in nutrient fluxes. In oligotrophic lakes, conservationists are interested in characterizing the influence of hydrological drivers on excessive periphyton growth along nearshore areas. We collected nutrient samples bi-weekly from groundwater and surface water during a 9-month monitoring period to evaluate the timing and availability of nutrients to eulittoral periphyton in Lake Tahoe. Groundwater discharge rates were measured synoptically using seepage meters and estimated indirectly using continuous head gradient measurements and aquifer properties estimated by slug tests. The discharge measurements made from the seepage meter measurements provide information about the spatial variability perpendicular from shore along and the change in groundwater discharge due to wave action. Algal biomass sampled from substrates and observed using underwater photographs were used to correlate seasonal growth and nutrient concentrations in groundwater and lake water. Results indicate that groundwater and nutrient discharge are temporally variable due to seasonal changes in recharge within the watershed, wave action, and lake stage. Groundwater discharge was enhanced by the seasonally-low lake stage and episodic recharge caused by precipitation falling as rain in the watershed. Increases in dissolved phosphorus and nitrate in the lake during winter are attributed to groundwater discharge and correlates to increases in algal biomass in the nearshore area. Results indicate that nutrient-rich groundwater discharge appears to stimulate seasonal periphyton blooms along the eulittoral zone of Lake Tahoe.

AB This article aims to provide an on the spot, handy field tool that can be used in estimating the Saturation Index with respect to calcite in karst aquifers in a limestone context. It relies on an abacus that gives the SIc by using measured pH and bicarbonate concentration as coordinates.
   The analytical expressions of the carbonate equilibrium equations are derived in order to calculate SIc from values that can be measured on field. Using these established relationships, we propose an Abacus built from the SIc = f(Pco(2)eq) reference frame, hence called SIc-Abacus.
   Accuracy of SIc calculation is also discussed. SIc is calculated with values measured considering uncertainty coming from pH ( +/- 0.05 pH units), temperature ( +/- 0.1 degrees C), bicarbonate and calcium concentrations ( +/- 2.5 mg/L and +/- 2 mg/L). This gives, for each sample, a range of possible SIc values of +/- 0.060 pH units (for a bicarbonate concentration close to 300 mg/L). The effect on SIc range of possible values given by bicarbonate and calcium uncertainties is about 10 times lower than the effect brought by pH uncertainty. Also, bicarbonate and calcium concentration can be estimated from electrical conductivity leading to a possible range of SIc value of +/- 0.087 pH units. In both cases, the range of possible values of SIc varies according to the bicarbonate concentration.
   Using Cussac and Lascaux sites, an evaluation was done. Results show the goodness of fit (R-2 = 0.96) between the calculated SIc from measured pH, bicarbonate and calcium concentration and the estimated SIc values generated from the SIc-Abacus. Apart from calculating SIc, another method which is an alternative use of the generated SIc equation focused on obtaining pH using parameters such as electrical conductivity and dissolved CO2 measurements is presented.
   The study shows that SIc-Abacus can be a new in-situ tool for karst aquifer surveys. It can facilitate in making a swift decision that tackles carbonate karst issues (e.g. when selecting sites or in deciding if extensive monitoring should be performed or not based from a specific objective).

AB Among the four types of drought, socioeconomic drought, which has a direct impact on human production and daily life, is the least understood. The current socioeconomic drought index proposed by Mehran et al. (2015) is the Multivariate Standardized Reliability and Resilience Index (MSRRI), which combines information on inflowdemand reliability and water storage resilience. The MSRRI resolves the problem of difficult quantification of socioeconomic drought. However, the MSRRI also has some flaws such as ignoring reservoir dispatching regulations and the relationship between water supply and water demand. Therefore, this study aims to improve the MSRRI through combining reservoir operation processes and actual water supply and demand and proposing an improved MSRRI (IMSRRI). The upper Yellow River Basin (UYRB) was selected as a case study, and comparison between the MSRRI and IMSRRI was conducted. The evolution characteristics of the IMSRRI series in the UYRB were examined. Additionally, cross-wavelet analysis was utilized to reveal the associations between the IMSRRI series and climate factors. Results indicated that: (1) compared with the MSRRI, the IMSRRI could capture the onset and termination of socioeconomic drought more accurately and reasonably due to the fusion of reservoir scheduling characteristics at a smaller timescale; (2) the socioeconomic drought in the UYRB had dramatically changed during the past few decades (the IMSRRI series showed a significantly decreasing trend and two change points (1995 and 1975) were captured); and (3) the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and the Atlantic Oscillation (AO) showed significant influences on the short period (the influences of ENSO were stronger than AO), while sunspots had the strongest impacts on the long period.

AB The hydrology and stormwater management benefits of green roofs (GRs) when integrated with photovoltaic (PV) arrays are currently not well understood. This study is the first quantitative study of an integrated full-scale GR-PV system in Canada. In this project, two GR-PV systems, with low (0.6 m) and high (1.2m) differential height (LDH and HDH) between the GR surface and PV panels have been compared with a GR test module for storm water retention and biomass. Over 51 rainfall events in summer and fall 2016 and spring 2017, rainwater retention, peak flow reduction, NRCS curve number, and biomass of GR-PV and GR systems were examined. Rainwater retention and peak flow reduction were not significantly different between the LDH and HDH systems. Vegetation growth was 47% greater in the HDH system compared to the LDH system. This was attributed to greater solar radiation and rain exposure of vegetation in the HDH system due to the greater vertical distance between the PV panels and the GR modules.

AB Overland routing processes are critical for understanding the water environment impact of the urbanization-induced land-cover change and guiding the optimized landscape planning. However, current models generally tend to simplify the overland flow process by a semi-distributed routing approach. In this study, the cellular automata-based hydrology and NPS pollution model (CA-HNPSM) is established by integrating the CA-based overland runoff routing algorithm and the NPS pollution module. Three-layer spaces were also constructed by considering the hydrological connection among urban roofs, land surfaces and artificial drainage networks. Simplified sewer routing modules were introduced to improve the applicability of the CA algorithm in urban NPS pollution studies with insufficient drainage data. Then, the CA-HNPSM is tested in a real case study on an urban catchment in Beijing, China. Based on the results, the CA-HNPSM shows good performance in both the hydrological and NPS simulations in terms of the Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient and coefficient of determination. Detailed overland routing processes and hydrological and pollution results are provided. In addition, landscape configurations along the overland flow routs could also be identified. These overland results can be used as powerful reference for optimized landscape planning and the allocation of management measures.

AB Nutrient enrichment from natural and anthropogenic activities is one of the major environmental pollution stressors. This study presents an integrated framework that couples a mesoscale atmospheric analysis system (SAFRAN), an agronomic model (STICS) and a distributed hydro(geo)logic model (EauDyssee) to estimate nitrogen flux at the regional scale. The EauDyssee modeling framework was developed to include nitrate transport from soils to rivers via surface runoff and stream-aquifer interactions. Further, an in-stream nitrate model was developed based on the large-scale river routing of the framework. The utility of the integrated framework was demonstrated on the Seine River Basin (SRB), which has an area of 88,000 square kilometers. The SRB is one of the most productive agricultural areas in France and encompasses the megalopolis of Paris. This basin is a complex hydrosystem with multiple aquifers. The STICS-EauDyssee integrated framework was implemented for a long-term simulation covering 39 years (1971-2010) at a daily time step. Comparison of groundwater nitrate concentrations with observations showed an overall absolute bias of less than 10 mg/L. Model results showed that simulated nitrate flux to rivers highly depend on the inflow produced by surface and subsurface waters. Results also demonstrated that approximately 10% of leaching nitrate flux is delivered to the river network from stream-aquifer interactions. The statistical analysis indicates the modeling system performs better in the eastern region of the SRB in comparison to the western part of the basin, due to the hydrological complexity of the western part of the basin. Comparison of maximum nitrate concentration between dry and wet years (1990 and 2001) showed an increase of 60%, largely driven by more annual water yield in the wet year compared to the dry year.

AB The paper presents various aspects of monitoring streamflows with stage-discharge (HQRC) and index-velocity (IVRC) based ratings at a non-ideal gaging station with emphasis on their reliance during fast-varying unsteady flows. For this purpose, the paper analyzes data obtained from customized experiments whereby the flow phases are tracked as they develop during flow transitions. The analysis compares discharges obtained from HQRC and IVRC ratings with those directly measured with Acoustic Doppler Current Profilers (ADCP) and a flowmeter set in the housing of the turbines that release the flow in the downstream channel. It is found that during steady flows, both HQRC and IVRC methods perform within the widely accepted +/- 5% thresholds recommended for streamflow gaging despite that the site considerably deviates from the guidelines for gaging site selection. For unsteady flows, the performance of the IVRC is considerably better than HQRC. Attempts are made to complement the typical statistical analysis used for assessing the quality of discharge estimates provided by the ratings with insights into flow characteristics that deteriorate the quality of the flow estimates passing through the stations.

AB The lower reaches of the Yellow River (Huanghe), a typical "raised bed river," have experienced many huge flood events in Chinese history. As the main factor controlling the topographic evolution of the channel, the water and sediment-supply conditions of the Yellow River have undergone significant changes since the implementation of the water and sediment regulation scheme (WSRS) in 2002 by the joint operation of large reservoirs. Hence, it is necessary to conduct systematic research and evaluation on how the regulation scheme influences the scouring and deposition of the downstream channel. This study used the elevation data of 79 fixed profiles collected between 1992 and 2012 from the channel downstream from Gaocun in the Yellow River to establish a digital elevation model. The elevation model was used to investigate the spatio-temporal characteristics of channel scouring and deposition in the study area and to determine the main controlling factors. The results show that on an inter-annual scale, the channel scouring and deposition pattern began to change from substantial deposition to rapid erosion after 2002. On a seasonal scale, the overall characteristic was erosion in the flood season and deposition in the dry season; however, the erosion rate in the flood season increased and the deposition rate in the dry season decreased after 2002. From the spatial perspective, the downstream riverbed experienced net deposition before 2002 and net scouring after 2002. The WSRS altered the regimes of water and sediment of the river and therefore dominated scouring and deposition in the downstream channel. Since the implementation of the WSRS, continuous channel scouring in the study area provided about 41% of coarse-grained sediments for the Yellow River, and formed an important source of sediments entering the sea. However, because of the formation of an armor layer of coarse-grained sediments on the downstream riverbed surface due to continuous scouring after the implementation of the WSRS, the erosion flux of the river channel in the lower reaches of the Yellow River has shown a significant decrease since 2005. This study provides a typical case study for the response of the topographic evolution of rivers to water and sediment changes under the influence of intense human activities.

AB Successful data assimilation depends on the accurate estimation of forcing data uncertainty. Forcing data uncertainty is typically estimated based on statistical error models. In practice, the hyper-parameters of statistical error models are often estimated by a trial-and-error tuning process, requiring significant analyst and computational time. To improve the efficiency of forcing data uncertainty estimation, this study proposes the direct use of existing ensemble climate products to represent climate data uncertainty in the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) of flow forecasting. Specifically, the Newman et al. (2015) dataset (N15 for short), covering the contiguous United States, northern Mexico, and southern Canada, is used here to generate the precipitation and temperature ensemble in the EnKF application. This study for the first time compares the N15 generated climate ensemble with the carefully tuned hyper-parameters generated climate ensemble in a real flow forecasting framework. The forecast performance comparison of 20 Quebec catchments shows that the N15 generated climate ensemble yields improved or similar deterministic and probabilistic flow forecasts relative to the carefully tuned hyper-parameters generated climate ensemble. Improvements are most evident for short lead times (i.e., 1-3 days) when the influence of data assimilation dominates. However, the analysis and computational time required to use N15 is much less compared to the typical trial-and-error hyper-parameter tuning process.

TI Water management paradigm shifts in the Caspian Sea region: Review an

ID HYDROSOCIAL CYCLE; HYDROLOGY
AB The study explores the shifts in water management paradigms in the Caspian Sea basin over the last three centuries with an emphasis on the period after 1990. The investigation is based on the chronological analysis of developments in the water sector, treaties and agreements between the littoral states, important technical inventions, and changes in political regimes. The methodology used in the paper captures two concepts. The concept of water management paradigms helps to comprehend developmental stages of water management of the Caspian Sea. The concept of hydrosocial cycle was applied as an analytical lens for studying each paradigm. We examine different understandings of water in the following five stages: i) pre-industrial era (before 1846); ii) industrialization era (1846-1917); iii) Soviet collectivization era (1917-1940); iv) hydraulic mission (1940-1990); v) independent littoral states (1990-present). Before the Industrial Revolution, the Caspian Sea was managed by the Russian Empire and Persia for navigation and fishing only. The ensuing technical progress gave an impulse to regional sectoral activities, pushing forward the hydraulic mission that caused a considerable degradation of the sea's ecosystems. The adoption of the Tehran Convention in 2003 became a first step towards the Integrated Water Resources Management (IWRM) paradigm for the Caspian. However, the water governance of the Caspian states does not adhere to the principles of IWRM and, consequently, environment continues to deteriorate. The study provides new directions and approaches for reviewing the role of society in the governance of the Caspian Sea and its resources.

AB Check dams are very important structures for torrent control areas throughout the world. Measuring the sediment deposition behind check dams is thought to be an effective method of estimating the sediment yield of small catchments. In this study, we employed a high-density electrical resistivity system to detect sediment at six check dams distributed in the hilly and gully area of the Loess Plateau. A total of 11 lines were arranged, with 60 electrodes along each line. The resultant resistivity data were inverted into subsurface structures using least-squares inversion techniques. The results indicate that the sediment bottom can been identified using an electrical resistivity contour method. Using trenches, boreholes and drillings to calibrate the calculated values, the accuracy of the high-density electrical resistivity tomography method was found to be quite high (95.7%). The bulk density increases with the sediment deposit depth and can reach a maximum of 1.6 g cm(-3). Geometric methods considering three shapes (V-shaped, U-shaped and trapezoidal) were used to estimate the profile area of the check dams; the V-shaped geometric method showed high accuracy. This study provides a four-step approach based on high-density electrical resistivity tomography and a geometric method to estimate sediment yield for check dam-controlled catchments. This methodology enables the measurement of the total sediment yield, including both the suspended and bedload sediment transport, from an ungauged catchment.

AB This paper presents a model of flow and solute transport of intermittent catchments in arid and semi-arid regions, highlighting challenges caused by the complex interactions between subsurface and surface flows. A case study is used for the application of the integrated MIKE SHE model to investigate temporal and spatial dynamics of water and salinity in a small ephemeral catchment in southwestern Victoria, Australia. MIKE SHE was successfully calibrated and validated against experimental data of streamflow, groundwater levels, and salt discharged from the catchment. Projections of climatic conditions, adopting Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) 4.5, 6.0, and 8.5, were used to infer how salinity discharge and concentrations might be affected across a range of greenhouse gas emission scenarios with different severity. The calibration of the water fluxes was solely based on parameters associated with the model of evapotranspiration, with other parameters selected from field observations and literature. The calibrated parameters for the salt transport were the longitudinal and lateral dispersivities. The calibration and validation of streamflow series led to Index of Agreement (IoA) of 0.92 and 0.8 respectively, while the simulation of groundwater levels was more challenging (IoA ranging from 0.22 to 0.89). Parameter equifinality was observed, with different parameter sets achieving a good fit of streamflow and groundwater levels, although leading to differing spatial patterns of evapotranspiration rates. Calibration and validation of the discharge concentrations appeared more difficult (IoA of 0.35 for calibration and 0.44 for validation) as they are affected by errors in the simulated flow. Climate projections RCP 8.5 suggested a reduction of salt discharge with consequent increased concentrations within the catchment. The study showed the ability of MIKE SHE to be successfully applied to intermittent dry catchments to possibly support water and land management.

AB According to the hydrological characteristics of a multi-source irrigation system with paddy rice, the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) is improved to develop a distributed hydro-agronomic model. A technique with three critical depths is incorporated to control the irrigation and drainage of paddy fields. In addition, the evapotranspiration (ET) of a paddy field is estimated based on two types of water storage conditions within SWAT. Specifically, we propose a multi-source auto-irrigation framework for SWAT to estimate agricultural irrigation water consumptions (AIWCs) from different water sources. Furthermore, we apply the improved SWAT to the Yangshudang (YSD) basin, located in the Zhanghe Irrigation System (ZIS) of southern China, and the simulation results are compared with the observed data as well as with those of the original SWAT. The results indicate that compared with the original SWAT, the Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) of daily discharge increases from 0.48 to 0.80 in the calibration period and from 0.68 to 0.84 in the validation period; in addition, the NSE of the daily ET increases from -0.09 to 0.90, and other evaluation metrics also increase. Moreover, the percent bias (PBIAS) between the total Arwc simulated by the improved SWAT and the observed value is 2.75%, and that is -48.59% for the original SWAT. In particular, the improved SWAT estimates AIWCs from local water sources (ponds and rivers) and the main Zhanghe Reservoir, and the simulated AIWCs approximate the observed values. Therefore, the improved SWAT is more effective and suitable for the simulation of hydrological processes than the original SWAT in the multi-source irrigation systems with paddy rice, and it can estimate the AIWCs from different water sources, which can provide irrigation management decision support for irrigation managers.

AB The purpose of an early warning system (EWS) is to issue warning signals prior to extreme events. Extreme weather events, however, are hard to predict due to their chaotic behavior. This paper suggests a method for an effective EWS for very short-term heavy rainfall with machine learning techniques. The EWS produces a warning signal when it is expected to reach the criterion for a heavy rain advisory within the next 3 h. We devised a selective discretization method that converts a subset of continuous input variables to nominal ones. Meteorological data obtained from automatic weather stations are preprocessed by the selective discretization and principal component analysis. As a classifier, logistic regression is used to predict whether or not a warning is required. A comparative evaluation was performed on the EWS models generated by various classifiers. The tests were run for 652 locations in South Korea from 2007 to 2012. The empirical results showed that the preprocessing methods improved the prediction quality and logistic regression works well on heavy rainfall nowcasting in terms of F-measure and equitable threat score.

AB A proposal to increase wastewater infiltration at the Kwinana Wastewater Treatment Plant (KWTP) to an unconfined aquifer near a groundwater flow-through wetland (The Spectacles) in Western Australia, prompted a study of the groundwater geochemistry and water levels to identify the water types and to develop a conceptual model for groundwater flow and geochemical evolution. Within the catchment, the water table has dramatically declined (e.g up to -70 to - 90 mm/yr over three decades) due to the drying climate and increasing demand for groundwater. Annual rainfall has declined by 9 mm/decade on average or about 1.4% of the annual mean over the last three decades Wastewater infiltration began in 1975 and has increased to the current rate of 4.7 thousand cubic meters per day. Groundwater-surface water interactions were interpreted using multivariate statistical analysis of major ion and stable isotope (delta O-18, delta D) data. Rainwater infiltrating through the aquifer interacts with carbonate minerals while flowing westward to produce a Ca-HCO3 type of water (Group 1). Below the wetland, groundwater has an evaporative signature (Group 2) that has higher concentrations of TDS (> 1 g/L) and distinctively higher delta O-18 (> 2.5 per mil) than groundwater derived from wastewater infiltration (Group 3). The ratio of ions (K:Cl) was used to understand the mixing of water types and to quantify the proportions of wastewater at the site. Water samples collected in 2014 reveal a high proportion ( > 34%) of wastewater within the uppermost 30 m of aquifer and generally decreasing proportions with distance away from the source. Further investigation of The Spectacles water balance and hydrochemistry is needed to optimally manage and prevent degradation of the water quality. Proposed increases in wastewater recharge may continue to help offset the impact of the drying climate on lake levels.

AB Lake Chad is an endorheic lake in the Sahel region of Africa at the southern edge of the Sahara Desert. The lake, which is well known for its dramatic decrease in surface area during the 1970s and 1980s, experiences an annual flood resulting in a maximum total surface water area generally during February or March, though sometimes earlier or later. People along the shores of Lake Chad make their living fishing, farming, and raising livestock and have a vested interest in knowing when and how extensive the annual flooding will be, particularly those practicing recession farming in which the fertile ground of previously flooded area is used for planting crops. In this study, the authors investigate the relationship between lake and basin parameters, including rainfall, basin evapotranspiration, lake evapotranspiration, lake elevation, total surface water area, and the previous year's total surface water area, and develop equations for each dry season month (except November) linking total surface water area to the other parameters. The resulting equations allow the user to estimate the December average monthly total surface water area of the lake in late November, and to make the estimates for January to May in early December. Based on the results of a Leave One Out Cross Validation analysis, the equations for lake area are estimated to have an average absolute error ranging from 5.3 percent (for February estimates) to 7.6 percent (for May estimates).

AB The stable isotopic composition of water (delta O-18, delta H-2) is used to trace different components of the hydrological cycle, particularly interactions between precipitation, surface, and ground water. In Greece, insufficient spatial coverage for isotopes in precipitation hinders investigations of relationship between ground water and precipitation, information that is required to help quantify aquifer replenishment rates. We used precipitation, geospatial, ground water isotope data and General Linear Models (GLM) to predict the spatial distribution of isotopes in phreatic ground water in Greece. Prediction covariates of elevation, latitude, distance to nearest coastline, drainage basin (western vs. eastern Greece), and amount of precipitation predicted 62% of the isotopic variance in ground water. The GLM model yielded predictions of the isotopic composition of shallow aquifers, which allowed us to construct maps for use in hydrological and other forensic applications in Greece. A comparison of the stable isotope values predicted by our GLM to those of existing precipitation models revealed that phreatic aquifers in Greece are mainly recharged during the annual wet period, between November and March, as documented by the high overlap coefficients of 0.77 and 0.82, respectively. Rainy-period-biased aquifer recharge has implications for water quality and management issues, for example, nitrate pollution may be enhanced in the non-growing rainy period when crop uptake is the lowest, or for water resource management if climatic changes alter these temporal rainfall patterns.

AB It is generally acknowledged in the environmental sciences that the choice of a computational model impacts the research results. In this study of a flood and drought event in the Swiss Thur basin, we show that modeling decisions during the model configuration, beyond the model choice, also impact the model results. In our carefully designed experiment we investigated four modeling decisions in ten nested basins: the spatial resolution of the model, the spatial representation of the forcing data, the calibration period, and the performance metric. The flood characteristics were mainly affected by the performance metric, whereas the drought characteristics were mainly affected by the calibration period. The results could be related to the processes that triggered the particular events studied. The impact of the modeling decisions on the simulations did, however, vary among the investigated sub-basins. In spite of the limitations of this study, our findings have important implications for the understanding and quantification of uncertainty in any hydrological or even environmental model. Modeling decisions during model configuration introduce subjectivity from the modeler. Multiple working hypotheses during model configuration can provide insights on the impact of such subjective modeling decisions.

AB Under the increasing risk of water scarcity, aquifer management strategies can take advantage of a deeper knowledge about the natural long-term fluctuations driven by climate patterns. This study examines the links between major large-scale atmospheric circulation modes and inter-annual to decadal oscillations in groundwater levels in Portugal. Precipitation and piezometric records (1987-2016) from two aquifer systems, Leirosa-Monte Real in the north and Querenca-Silves in the south, are analyzed using wavelet transform methods and singular spectral analysis. Wavelet coherences computed between hydrologic time series and the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), East Atlantic (EA) and Scandinavia (SCAND) climate patterns show non-stationary relationships that are nonetheless consistent in distinct period bands. The strongest covariability occurs in the 6-10 years band for NAO, in the 2-4 years band for EA (especially after 1999) and in the 4-6 years band for SCAND (mainly after 2005). NAO is the mode playing the most relevant role with a stronger influence in the south (60% on average) than in the north (40% on average). The relatively higher frequency ( < 5 year period) contributions of EA and SCAND are difficult to set apart but their joint impact accounts for approximately 20% and 40% of the total variance of groundwater levels in the south and north of the country, respectively. Wavelet coherence patterns also expose transitive couplings between NAO, EA and SCAND. Often, coupled phases between climate modes mark abrupt transitions in synchronization patterns and shifts in the time-frequency domain. Extremes in groundwater storage coincide with anti-phase NAO and EA combinations: maximum piezometric levels occur during NAO-EA + (coincidentally also SCAND + ) phases while minimum levels occur during NAO + EA - phases.

AB Coastal flooding due to storm surge and sea-level rise (SLR) affects seawater intrusion (SWI) in aquifers. Under coastal flooding events, SWI from both sea boundary and land-surface is expected to increase. SWI in coastal aquifers is also strongly influenced by geological heterogeneity characteristics. In this study, the combined impacts of fully geological heterogeneity and coastal flooding on SWI is quantified in a two-dimensional unconfined coastal aquifer. Three indices including the seawater toe location (x(toe)), the mixing volume (v(mv)) and the SWI volume (v(swiv)) are used to assess the vulnerability to the intrusion of the seawater. A series of 50 log-normally distributed random hydraulic conductivity with a spherical correlation function is generated using the GCOSIM3D code. Then, numerical simulations of transient, saturated-unsaturated variable-density flow and solute transport, SUTRA, are performed in a stochastic Monte Carlo framework to understand how coastal flooding and geological heterogeneity effects can change the groundwater salinity.
   During storm surge events, seawater penetrates into the aquifer and leads to reduce temporary of the freshwater quality. The results indicate that the storm surge has a short-term impact on fresh groundwater. The aquifer is significantly influenced by SLR as a long-term effect while it causes a larger x(toe) in comparison with pre-flooding events' conditions. Also, the results obtained under gradual and instantaneous assumption of SLR show that the gradual assumption leads to a smaller x(toe) which is more realistic. Comparison of the homogeneous and heterogeneous scenarios indicates the heterogeneity affects SWI status both in the presence and the absence of coastal flooding events. It causes reduction in x(toe) and v(swtv) as well as increase in v(mv). This study shows the significant value of considering a wide range of variations due to heterogeneity, in order to better manage the coastal fresh groundwater aquifers.

AB Water inrush incidents threaten the safety of coal mining. Understanding of hydrogeologic parameter distributions is critical for preventing water-related hazards in coal mines. During the deep mining ( > 1000 m) under the North China Plain, water from water-bearing strata discharges into coal seams through geologic conduits (i.e. water inrush) due to the fractured zone under the floor of working faces. In this study, a water inrush incident was exploited as an active stimulus. A 3D groundwater flow model was built for the eighth member of the Middle Ordovician system in Xingdong coal mine. Using this model and an inverse approach, we first checked if the data from the incident and an independent pumping test carry non-redundant information about the heterogeneity of the mine. Afterward, we combined these datasets to conduct a large-scale (approximately 10 km) hydraulic tomography (HT) analysis. The estimated hydraulic conductivity distribution from the HT analysis is found consistent with the distribution of known geologic faults. That is, a cluster of faults is characterized as a high-conductivity zone. A high conductivity zone is identified at locations close to the water inrush location, which is the high cement consumption zone during the grouting project. Finally, results of this study promote exploiting the water inrush events as a HT survey for mapping geologic structures over a large area.

AB Parameter calibration and uncertainty estimation are crucial for hydrological simulations in the distributed land surface-hydrological model. To investigate soil properties impacting hydrological processes, five conventional pedo-transfer functions (PTFs) are applied to create a 3D soil hydraulic parameter (SHP) ensemble in the Weather Research and Forecasting-Hydrological extension (WRF-Hydro), a distributed, multi-physics land surface hydrological model. The SHPs are generated, based on a high-resolution Chinese soil property dataset, over the heterogeneous Upper Huaihe River basin. The results show that the SHPs can influence the streamflow in WRF-Hydro, which is similar to the impact of the scaling parameters on the streamflow over the study basin. Analyses of the uncertainty in the SHP ensemble reveal that SHPs mainly constrain the peak flow during the flood rise and impact the baseflow during the flood recession. A hydrological Bayesian model average (BMA) method is constructed to postprocess the streamflow ensemble based on the 3D SHPs. Probabilistic streamflow estimations by the BMA method are more skillful than the simulations using the individual 3D SHP ensemble members for all five studied hydrological stations, especially for high flows. Therefore, improved estimation of the uncertainty in the 3D SHPs may enhance the spatial representation of flood processes, resulting in more accurate estimates of the streamflow in the main streams in a heterogeneous basin.

AB This study develops a novel approach to data-driven hydrological modeling. The approach adopts the feature representation technique in computer vision to effectively exploit spatial information contained in time-variant input data fields and seamlessly fuse multisource information via machine learning. The new approach overcomes a major limitation of existing approaches in which the spatial heterogeneity of input variables cannot be sufficiently accounted for. The approach is applied to predict the streamflow in a watershed on the northern margin of the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau, and its performance is compared with various data-driven and process-based models. The major findings are as follows. First, the new approach represents a general framework for the fusion of multisource spatiotemporal data for hydrological modeling and demonstrates great potential to incorporate fast-growing environmental big data. Second, the new approach demonstrates satisfactory short-term forecasting, long-term simulation, and transfer learning performances and is promising for addressing predictions in ungauged basins. Third, the predictors, including precipitation, temperature, leaf area index, and historical streamflow, play markedly distinct roles in modeling streamflow with the novel approach. Finally, topographic information is not a necessary model input in the proposed approach because spatial patterns can be well embodied by other inputs (e.g., temperature) that have high similarities with topography. This study represents the first attempt to bring computer vision into data-driven hydrological modeling and may inspire future studies in this promising direction.

AB Many urbanized areas in the world are using artificial recharge basins (ARB) as an efficient solution to maintain adequate groundwater recharge while coping with flooding problems. The effective management of these basins to adequately maintain their functionality over mid-to-long term requires a suitable monitoring network. Here, we explored the use of a temporal satellite analysis to closely evaluate the efficiency of the ARB in terms of infiltration capacity, depending on hydraulic conditions of the topsoil transitioning from unclogged to clogged conditions in the ARB.
   COSMO-SkyMed synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images were integrated with ground data and numerical modeling to advance the capability for monitoring low water levels and flooded areas within the ARB. The understanding of biofilm development and effects was achieved by identifying anomalous drawdown phases, by constraining ponding boundary conditions in the numerical model, and by estimating subsequent infiltration rate changes under progressive clogging.
   With appropriate meteorological conditions (consecutive rainfall events separated by few dry days), the biofilm could develop rapidly and cover large surfaces (e.g., 22 ha) in about two months. During this process, the hydraulic conductivity of the basin surface could decrease by more than three orders of magnitude, completely altering the relationship with the local groundwater regime. Quantitative estimation of the evolution of the infiltration rate provides crucial insights about the overall recharge behavior of ARBs to make reliable economical plans in both the design and monitoring phase.

AB In this paper, a mathematical model for conflict resolution among a diverse set of agricultural water users in Golestan province, Iran, is developed. Given the bi-level nature of the distribution of power in the current problem, a combination of Leader-Follower game and Nash-Harsanyi bargaining solution method is employed to find optimal water and crop area allocations. The Golestan Regional Water Authority is the leader in this setting, controlling the total water allocations; and the agricultural sectors are the followers, competing over the allocated water. Two objectives for the leader are (i) maximizing profits, and (ii) maximizing share of green water in total agricultural production through selecting more efficient crop patterns. The followers' objective is merely maximizing obtained benefits for the selected crop patterns. Virtual water concept is also factored into the related objective functions, and the water allocation problem is solved considering spatio-temporal crop pattern along with a dynamic water pricing system. This involves using a hybrid optimization structure as a new approach to solving two level optimization problems. The results show that the leader's income is independent of total water allocation and is only affected by crop pattern and crop area, two factors which drive water price too. The followers' benefit also depends on crop pattern and crop area, as they influence the crop yield, cost and water price. Finally, green water plays a key role in selecting the optimal crop pattern and crop area.

ID CHALLENGES; DOMINATION; GOVERNANCE; CONFLICT
AB The Yarlung Zangbo-Brahmaputra - Jamuna river basin (further referred to as Brahmaputra River Basin) is one of the most important river systems in South Asia. It originates on the Tibetan Plateau and links Bangladesh, Bhutan, China, and India. Despite being an important river system of South Asia, with an immense potential for regional development, very little progress has been made so far at regional level to manage this transboundary river. Apart from stereotypical upstream-downstream syndromes, a lack of trust, an atmosphere of hostility, and an asymmetric information and power situation as also the absence of regional principles or frameworks make transboundary interaction between the Brahmaputra riparian countries complex and challenging. The lack of information and knowledge regarding the river itself makes decision-making further complicated. Negotiation for a basin-wide treaty on cooperation in the absence of trust is a non-starter for the Brahmaputra basin, for it may result in asymmetric cooperation, opening up ground for future conflicts. To avoid such asymmetric cooperation, information-rich, multilateral informal dialogues need to take place to develop an accepted definition of cooperation, which meets the needs of all riparian states.
   The article provides an outline of the current issues in the Brahmaputra river basin and illustrates the need for multitrack and multi-stakeholder dialogues in the Brahmaputra region. The paper is inspired by the 'Brahmaputra Dialogue' project initiated in 2013, that demonstrates that water diplomacy has to be an inclusive, open, and transparent process involving multiple actors, because such interaction facilitates sustainable water cooperation, not only between riparian countries but also between riparian communities.

AB The identification of storm tracks that generate the annual maximum floods and the quantification of their air-moisture content is proposed to understand better the atmospheric generation processes of floods in Spain, as well as their decreasing trends identified previously. In this work, the role of the atmospheric component on hydrological changes on Spain by using storm track data generated by the hybrid single particle Lagrangian integrated trajectory model (HYSPLIT) is examined. Storm tracks associated with annual maximum flood series from 14 streamflow gauges located across Spain are obtained by using NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis data. They are classified into five clusters through use of the K-means algorithm. It was also shown that the use of five clusters was able to reproduce the five major types of storms identified in Spain reported in the literature. The posterior grouping of the five associated storm types into two bigger groups (Oceanic and Continental storms), led to a coherent seasonal and spatial behaviour of hydrological regimes. For some gauges, it was observed that distinct flood statistics, such as mean and variance, differ significantly as a result of atmospherically distinct generation processes, suggesting that local annual maximum flood series may be non-homogeneous as a result of contrasting atmospheric generation processes. By means of logistic regression, it is estimated that the probability of occurrence of Oceanic storms reduced significantly in the Spanish Atlantic region along the studied period. Furthermore, the existence of low-frequency cycles introduces significant variation in the occurrence of storm types in the country, with them being much more frequent during the period 1975-1979, while Oceanic storms were more frequent during the 1983-1987 and 1996-1999 periods. Those storms classified as Continental are observed in 59.3% of the studied cases, while those termed Oceanic in 40.7%. Continental storms also contribute with more moisture in the studied cases, that is to say, 63.1% of total moisture content, while Oceanic storms contributed with 36.9%.

AB Thermal regime and its response to meteorological and hydrological forcings play an important role in controlling water quality and ecosystem of lakes. Many large floodplain lakes are subjected to significant river-lake interactions and could benefit greatly from hydrodynamic modeling. The current work presents a first attempt to use a 3D hydrodynamic model and statistical methods to explore spatiotemporal variations and primary causal factors of thermal stability within a large river-lake-floodplain system (Poyang Lake, China). The hydrodynamic model successfully reproduced the lake hydrodynamics and thermal dynamics through a comparative analysis of field measurements. Simulation results revealed that the thermal stability of Poyang Lake exhibits similar spatial patterns between seasons; however, the lake is generally stratified during summer and early autumn. It is classified as partial mixed and full mixed during winter and spring. The thermal stratification may develop in the center area and eastern bay area of the lake, while the full mixing is likely to occur in the floodplains and the main flow channels. Statistics and simulations indicate that the air temperature, solar radiation and evaporation trigger a positive effect on the thermal stability of Poyang Lake, whereas a negative relationship is recognized due to the catchment river temperature. The responses of thermal stability to the meteorological and hydrological changes are much stronger in summer than other seasons, producing a significant seasonal thermal regime in the floodplain lake. Additionally, the dynamics in the lake water depth and associated hydrological regime are a major factor in maintaining the seasonal thermal stability of Poyang Lake. The findings of this study can support management of Poyang Lake as well as other similar floodplain lakes, by providing information on both water quality and ecosystem succession.

AB In this paper, a model is proposed for the assessment of the effectiveness of various mulches in increasing deep percolation of rainfalls for enhancing arid zones aquifers. For this purpose, 8 precipitations were selected from the Intensity-Duration-Frequency (IDF) curves of the study area with a return period of 2 and 5 years. The deep percolation of these precipitations were examined in lysimeters with gravel, sand and mixed mulches and without any mulch. Then 192 data of soil moisture, daily maximum air-temperature and deep percolation were measured for driving empirical equations. Moreover, the efficiency and accuracy of these empirical equations were investigated using Coefficient of Determination (CD) and Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency Coefficient (NSEC). The results showed that the obtained empirical equations could estimate deep percolation and evaporation with an acceptable accuracy. Using these equations and the soil-water balance equation, a soil moisture model was developed for the assessment of deep percolation. Then it was examined to evaluate the efficiency of the mulched soils in increasing soil moisture and aquifer recharging of three years' precipitations in Shahrekord plain, Iran. The results showed that the deep percolation increased in all examined mulched soils compared to unmulched soil, its maximum and cumulative increase were in gravel mulch with 21.3% and 30%, respectively. Furthermore, groundwater modeling results showed that the mulching could improve groundwater level as 0.34 m over a three year period. Finally, this paper proposes soil mulching for enhancing groundwater resources and a model to assess it.

AB Water diplomacy needs institutional anchoring. International River Basin Organizations (RBOs) - being the result of diplomatic efforts by riparian states intending to create a framework for cooperation between themselves over shared water bodies - can provide such institutional anchors. RBOs ensure that agreements to cooperate are turned into a long-term commitment by riparian states to jointly manage shared water resources and, in turn, foster mutually beneficial cooperation over time. RBOs have been the subject of detailed examinations of their conceptual core, of their manifold functions, of their effectiveness in achieving their goals and so forth. However, the legal nature of these entities has so far received limited attention notwithstanding its significance in empowering RBOs to act as institutional anchors for water diplomacy. Legitimate questions arise, for instance, in relation to their legal personality, or lack thereof, or to matters such as immunities and privileges. This paper will review key legal aspects of RBOs and illustrate them with examples. A sound understanding of such issues is crucial to supporting fruitful discussions between state members about the legal design of an RBO in order to fulfill their particular needs in the context of water diplomacy.

AB The practice of stormwater infiltration is widely used to reduce the amount of urban stormwater runoff delivered to drainage systems and receiving waters. In theory, the practice recharges groundwater, leading to increased urban stream baseflow. In reality, however, little is known about the fate of infiltrated stormwater. Because urban groundwater pathways are numerous and the interactions with subsurface infrastructure (e.g. trenches, pipes, etc.) are highly complex, the spatial and temporal variability of the contribution of infiltrated stormwater to baseflow is difficult to predict. We tracked the fate of infiltrated stormwater out of an 1800 m(2) infiltration basin (3.5% of its 5-ha impervious catchment) using a network of piezometers for over three years. We found that groundwater levels downslope of the basin were increased (up to 4 m) while water levels in an array of reference piezometers lateral to the basin showed no change (dry at depths ranging 2-4 m). Monthly water balance calculations indicated that in summer, most of the infiltrated stormwater was evapotranspired by the vegetation downslope of the basin, and thus did not reach the receiving stream. In the colder months, some infiltrated stormwater did reach the stream as plant water use declined. Anthropogenic disturbances (a sewer pipe and stream re-alignment) interacted with the upper part of the plume of infiltrated stormwater, locally lowering the water table. The study provides evidence that the fate of infiltrated stormwater is complex, and that infiltrated stormwater does not always reach receiving streams as baseflow as is often assumed.

AB This study evaluates the utility of ambient temperature profiles collected in sealed bedrock boreholes to assess variability in groundwater flow in discretely fractured shallow bedrock environments. A conceptual model for groundwater flow and groundwater-surface water temperature conditions and their interaction in a temperate climate is developed through a statistical interpretation of time-lapse thermal deviation logs. Temperature profiles were collected in three angled and three vertical boreholes drilled to 24-32 mbgs (meters below ground surface) and temporarily sealed with an impermeable fabric liner in a fractured dolostone bedrock aquifer adjacent to and extending beneath a bedrock river to monitor seasonal hydrodynamics. Ambient borehole temperature profiles collected every 1-8 weeks over a 12 month period identified zones of hydraulic activity during periods of intra-seasonal stability without the interference of open borehole cross-connection. Signal cross-correlation and Fourier spectra analysis of thermal deviation logs provided a novel way to observe the shallow bedrock flow system's temperature evolution due to advection along discrete fractures in response to seasonal transience, and to identify and isolate noise caused by free-convection cells within the sealed borehole. This approach represents a diagnostic tool that improves confidence in identifying depth discrete, hydraulically active fracture zones from thermal deviation data sets in a shallow, fractured sedimentary bedrock environment. Variably scaled free-convection cells were observed within the borehole water columns during the colder winter periods. Although these periods were accompanied by higher signal noise near the river/atmospheric interface, these cells led to a temporary thermal disequilibrium between the borehole water column and formation water deeper in the bedrock. These conditions increased the maximum depth of thermal detections associated with discrete groundwater flow features from 14 mbgs in the summer to 26 mbgs in the winter, thereby enhancing the understanding of shallow groundwater flow systems under the direct influence of surface water.

AB Characterization of dense non-aqueous phase liquid (DNAPL) distribution is important to facilitate the decision of remediation strategies. However, it is still a great challenge to characterize DNAPL source zone architecture with high resolution due to subsurface heterogeneity and relatively sparse data from traditional hydrogeological investigations. To overcome difficulties from such sparse data, electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) is introduced to locate DNAPL using time-lapse cross-borehole measurements. Due to the significant impact of geological heterogeneity on DNAPL source zone architecture, a data assimilation framework based on the coupled multiphase fluids-ERT model is developed to jointly invert DNAPL saturation and the permeability field using time-lapse ERT data. To validate the efficiency and performance of this framework, synthetic and laboratory experiments are both performed to monitor DNAPL migration and distribution in 3D heterogeneous sandbox with cross-borehole ERT. Result shows that time-lapse ERT and direct inversion can map the evolution of the DNAPL plume but loses details regarding the plume morphology due to the over-smoothing caused by geophysical inversion using an isotropic and homogeneous roughness-based regularization procedure. By contrast, the coupled inversion is successful to characterize both the permeability field and the evolution of the DNAPL plume with a higher resolution. This is because the coupled inversion is able to directly translate raw geophysical data into hydrologic meaningful information and therefore avoid artifacts caused by direct geophysical inversion.

AB Suspended sediment has significant effects on reservoir storage capacity, the operation of hydraulic structures and river morphology. Hence, modeling suspended sediment loads (SSL) in rivers contributes to various water resource management and river engineering. An evaluation of stand-alone data mining models (i.e., reduced error pruning tree (REPT), M5P and instance-based learning (IBK)) and hybrid models, (i.e., bagging-M5P, random committee-REPT (RC-REPT) and random subspace-REPT (RS-REPT)) for predicting SSL resulting from glacial melting at an Andean catchment in Chile has been conducted in this study. The best input combinations are constructed based on Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) of hourly SSL time series data with water discharge (Q), water temperature (T) and electrical conductivity (C) for different time lags. Seventy percent of the available data (one year of hourly data) is used to calibrate the models (dataset training) and the remaining 30% is used for model evaluation (dataset testing). The performances of the models are evaluated using several quantitative and graphical criteria, including coefficient of determination (R2), root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE), percentage of bias (PBIAS), the ratio of RMSE to the standard deviation of observation (RSR), a Taylor diagram and a boxplot. All the models performed well in predicting SSL. However, the Friedman and Wilcoxon signed rank tests revealed that predicted SSL significantly differed for different models except between IBK (or M5P) and REPT. The hybrid models performed better than individual models. The bagging-M5P had the best predictive capability while the KEPT had the poorest.

AB Despite of diverse progressions in hydrological modeling techniques, the necessity of a robust, accurate, reliable, and trusted expert system for real-time stream flow prediction still exists. The intention of the present study is to establish a new complementary data-intelligence (DI) model called wavelet extreme learning machine (WAELM) for forecasting river flow in a semi-arid environment. The monthly river flow data for the period 1991-2010 is used to calibrate and validate the applied predictive model, developed using antecedent flow data as predictor. The prediction efficiency of the developed WA-ELM model is validated against stand-alone ELM model. The performance of the models is diagnosed using multiple statistical metrics and graphical analysis visualization. The results reveal that incorporation of data pre-processing wavelet approach with ELM model enhances the river flow predictability. In quantitative term, the root-mean-square error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE) measurements are reduced by 65% and 67% using WA-ELM over ELM model, respectively. The Taylor diagram reveals much closer proximity and the Violin plot shows similar distribution of WA-ELM simulated river flow to the observed river flow compared to stand-alone ELM simulated river flow. The hybridization of wavelet decomposition method with ELM model improves the ability of ELM model to extract the required information for modeling the non-stationary and high stochastic river flow pattern. Overall, the study reveals that WA-ELM can be a reliable methodology for modeling river flow in semi-arid environment and for different regimes (i.e., low-, medium- and high-flow).

AB Region of influence is a common approach to estimate runoff information at ungauged locations. To estimate flood quantiles from annual maximum discharges, the Generalized Least Squares (GLS) framework has been recommended to account for unequal sampling variance and intersite correlation, which requires a proper evaluation of the sampling covariance structure. Since some jurisdictions do not have clear guidelines to perform this evaluation, a general procedure using copulas and a nonparametric intersite correlation model is investigated to estimate sampling covariance structure in situations where no common at-site distribution is imposed or when some paired sites do not have common periods of record. The investigated methodology is applied on 771 sites in Canada. The Normal copula is verified to be an adequate model that better fit paired observations than other types of extreme copulas. A sensitivity analysis is carried out to evaluate the impact of either ignoring, or considering a simpler form of, intersite correlation. Additionally, super regions are defined based on drainage area and mean annual precipitation to improve the calibration of pooling groups across large territories and a wide range of climate conditions. Performance criteria based on cross-validation revealed that using super regions and a combination of geographic distance and similarity between catchment descriptors improves the calibration of the pooling groups by providing more accurate estimates.

AB In this study, we investigate changes in future streamflows in California using bias-corrected and routed streamflows derived from global climate model (GCM) simulations under two representative concentration pathways (RCPs): RCP4.5 and RCP8.5. Unlike previous studies that have focused mainly on the mean streamflow, annual maxima or seasonality, we focus on projected changes across the distribution of streamflow and the underlying causes. We report opposing trends in the two tails of the future streamflow simulations: lower low flows and higher high flows with no change in the overall mean of future flows relative to the historical baseline (statistically significant at 0.05 level). Furthermore, results show that streamflow is projected to increase during most of the rainy season (December to March) while it is expected to decrease in the rest of the year (i.e., wetter rainy seasons, and drier dry seasons). We argue that the projected changes to streamflow in California are driven by the expected changes to snow patterns and precipitation extremes in a warming climate. Changes to future low flows and extreme high flows can have significant implications for water resource planning, drought management, and infrastructure design and risk assessment.

AB Budyko-type models in hydrology are simple but efficient descriptions of the vegetation-mediated hydrologic cycle in catchments. Based on hypothesized similarities between vegetation and human water consumption interactions in terms of water demand, constraints, and system functioning as well as catchment processes and outcomes, a corresponding Budyko-type framework is proposed here for human water consumption at the catchment scale. To validate this framework, socioeconomic data (human water consumption and economic and agricultural structure data), as well as hydrometeorological data, for 51 human-impacted catchments located in 10 major river basins in China were assembled. The results demonstrate (1) similar observed patterns to the traditional Budyko curves, with two limits and a monotonous increase shape; (2) the same functional form and mathematical features of the derived Budyko-type equation. Parameters of the new Budyko-type model for human consumption are estimated and analyzed based on the concept of water productivity. This study suggests that the functioning of both social and hydrologic subsystems within catchment systems can be explored within a common conceptual framework, thus providing a unified socio-hydrologic basis for the study of human-water systems.

AB The Nierji Basin, in the north-east of China, is one of the most important basins in the joint operation of the entire Songhua River, containing a major reservoir used for flood control. It is necessary to forecast the flow of the basin during periods of flood accurately and with the maximum lead time possible. This paper presents a flood forecasting system, using the Data Based Mechanistic (DBM) modeling approach and Kalman Filter data assimilation for flood forecasting in the data limited Nierji Reservoir Basin (NIRB). Examples are given of the application of the DBM methodology using both single input (rainfall or upstream flow) and multiple input (rainfalls and upstream flow) to forecast the downstream discharge for different sub-basins. Model identification uses the simplified recursive instrumental variable (SRIV) algorithm, which is robust to noise in the observation data. The application is novel in its use of stochastic optimisation to define rain gauge weights and identify the power law nonlinearity. It is also the first application of the DBM methodology to flood forecasting in China. Using the methodology allows the forecasting with lead times of 1-day, 2-day, 3-day, 4-day, 5-day with 98%, 97%, 96%, 96% and 93% forecast coefficient of determination respectively, which is sufficient for the regulation of the reservoirs in the basin.

AB The Floc Size Distributions (FSDs) of biomineral suspended particles are of great importance to understand the dynamics of bio-mediated Suspended Particulate Matters (SPMs). Field observations were investigated at Station MOW1 in Belgian coastal waters (southern North Sea) during two typical periods with abundant and reduced biomass. In addition, the Shen et al. (2018) [Water Res. Vol 145, pp 473-486] multi-class population balance flocculation model was extended to address the occurrence of suspended microflocs, macroflocs and megaflocs during these contrasting periods. The microflocs are treated as elementary particles that constitute macroflocs or megaflocs. The FSD is represented by the size and mass fraction of each particle group, which corresponds to a temporal and spatial varying mass weighted settling velocity. The representative sizes of macroflocs and megaflocs are unfixed and migrated between classes mainly due to the effects of turbulent shear, differential settling and biofilm growth. The growth of an aggregate because of bio-activities is allotted to each elementary particle. It is further hypothesized that the growth kinetics of biomineral particles due to biofllm coating follows the logistic equation. This simple bio-flocculation model has been successfully coupled in the open source TELEMAC modeling system with five passive tracers in a quasi-1D vertical case. Within an intra-tide scale, the settling velocity (w(s)) is large during slack tides while it is small during maximum current velocities because of variations in turbulence intensities. Nonetheless, the w(s), may be largely underestimated when the biological effect is neglected. For a seasonal pattern, the w(s), is higher in biomass-rich periods in May than in biomass-poor periods in October. While the mean sizes of megaflocs are close during the two periods, the macroflocs during algae bloom periods are more abundant with a larger mean size. This study enhances our knowledge on the dynamics of SPMs, especially the biophysical influences on the fate and transport of estuarine aggregates.

AB Groundwater overdraft due to extensive irrigation has led to a shallow aquifer depletion crisis in the Haihe River basin. Quantitative simulation of the variations in shallow groundwater and crop yield under different conditions of limited exploitation using a distributed hydrological model is important in the well-irrigated plain of this basin. Based on multiple modeling experiments by a modified Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model, three limited irrigation schemes for winter wheat (Triacum aestivum L.) were selected as simulation scenarios. The simulated results using the SWAT model showed that under scenario 1 (applying two rounds of irrigation corresponding to the jointing and heading stages of winter wheat), the average rate of decline in the shallow groundwater table was approximately 2/3 of that under the basic scenario (current irrigation schedule), but the winter wheat yield decreased by 13% compared with the basic scenario. Under scenario 2 (applying one round of irrigation at the jointing stage of winter wheat), the average rate of decline in the shallow groundwater table was approximately 1/4 of that under the basic scenario, but the reduction in the winter wheat yield compared with the basic scenario increased to 28%. The amount of overexploited shallow groundwater in the cropland area decreased from 17.5 x 10(8) m(3) a(-1) (under the basic scenario) to 11.0 x 10(8) m(3) a(-1) under scenario 1 and 4.5 x 10(8) m(3) a(-1) under scenario 2. Under scenario 3 (rain-fed conditions during the winter wheat season), the regional variation in the shallow groundwater table shifted to a recovery trend with an average rate of 0.22 m a(-1), which was equivalent to restoring 3.5 x 10(8) m(3) a(-1) of shallow aquifer storage in the cropland area. However, the reduction in the winter wheat yield compared with the basic scenario reached 54% under the rainfed scheme. Considering the trade-off between groundwater conservation and crop production under limited exploitation, linear programming was used to optimize the irrigation schedule at the subbasin scale. As a result, to satisfy the constraint of stopping groundwater drawdown, the average minimal reduction in the winter wheat yield would be 42% under the optimal irrigation schedule. By contrast, to satisfy the constraint of restricting the reduction in the crop yield to within the threshold required to maintain winter wheat self-sufficiency, the minimal rate of decline in the shallow groundwater table would be 0.26-0.52 m a(-1) under the optimal irrigation schedule. In addition, the uncertainty in the simulated shallow groundwater variation in this study was acceptable, indicating that the above assessments could provide reasonable references for regional groundwater management.

AB Hydrological models represent valuable tools to investigate the impacts of land use changes on water resources. Most commonly, distributed, physically-based models are applied for land use change impact studies in hydrology. However, providing a physically-based and detailed description of subsurface flows in karst systems is challenging. Lumped models, in contrast, are easy to implement and widely used in karst hydrological research, albeit not applicable for land use change impact studies. To overcome these limitations, we developed a new semi-distributed model LuKARS (Land use change modeling in KARSt systems) that lumps the predominant hydrotopes (i.e. distinct landscape units characterized by homogeneous hydrological properties as a result of similar land use and soil types) present in a catchment as independent, non-linear units. Flows from each hydrotope represent a specific response of the vadose zone (soil-epikarst-infiltration zone) in a defined recharge area. The saturated zone consists of a single linear storage unit recharged by each hydrotope independently. The main goal of this approach was to investigate land use change impacts in a dolomite karst system exploited for the water supply of the city of Waidhofen a.d. Ybbs (Austria) by changing the area covered by each hydrotope. Here, land use changes occured in the form of increasing spaces used for dolomite mining and at the expense of existing forest sites. With our parametrized model, we were able to reproduce the measured discharge in the largest spring of the Waidhofen karst system (Kerschbaum spring). Moreover, we succeeded in transferring the parametrized hydrotopes to other recharge areas (Hinterlug and Mitterlug) and validated the transferability of the modeling approach. Finally, we successfully showed the model's applicability for land use change impact studies by validating the calibrated model in a period in which the space of the dolomite quarries in the Kerschbaum recharge area almost doubled. The results of our study show that an increase of the dolomite quarries negatively affects the water supply of the city of Waidhofen a.d. Ybbs.

AB A frozen soil layer may impede snowmelt infiltration, resulting in a large amount of runoff that influences the soil water balance and anion movement in the soil profile. To examine the relationships among soil frost depth, snowmelt runoff, and nitrate leaching in agricultural fields, we measured both the snowmelt runoff for three winters and other environmental factors including the soil frost depth and nitrate content in a similar to 10,000 m(2) field. We divided the field into two subplots: one was maintained in a natural snow cover condition (the control plot), and the snow cover was compacted on the other plot (the treated plot) to enhance the development of the soil frost depth. In all three winters, soil frost depths in the control plot were < 0.2 m and very little runoff was observed during the snowmelt period. In contrast, the soil frost depth became > 0.4 m and a large amount of snowmelt runoff was observed in the treated plot. The depth of the peak nitrate concentration after the snowmelt period was shallower in the treated plot compared to the control plot. Moreover, a significant linear relationship was observed between (1) the amount of nitrate in the 0-0.3 m depth after the snowmelt period and (2) the total amount of snowmelt infiltration calculated by subtracting the amount of snowmelt runoff from the amount of snowmelt water. These results suggest that snow compaction can be a promising technique to develop a uniform soil frost depth in large-scale fields, which consequently controls the soil water and nutrient movement in the soil layer.

AB Informational entropy can be used to elucidate some important relationships between precipitation, evapotranspiration (ET), and discharge over a range of spatial and temporal scales. Entropy does not suffer from any a priori assumptions of linearity or distributional characteristics. In a study of the Southeastern United States, entropy and mutual information were used to identify relationships between hydrologic variables over spatial scales from a few hundred to several thousand km(2) and temporal scales from days to months. Two distinct ET data sets were compared- one based on a highly parameterized energy budget approach and the other based on a complex iterative solution and a modified Penman method. It was found that there was a considerable difference in uncertainty between the two methods and that, although they each contained some amount of explanatory information regarding streamflow the more complex approach contained the most shared information. Further, it was found that streamflow entropy, or uncertainty, increased with drainage area, indicating that larger basins have more uncertainty to be reduced, in that more information can possibly be gained through the knowledge of other variables. However, the knowledge of ET reduces a greater proportion of uncertainty in smaller basins (< 1500 km(2)), while larger basins have more unexplained variability.

AB Fracture-scale heterogeneity plays an important role in driving dispersion, mixing and heat transfer in fractured rocks. Current approaches to characterize fracture scale flow and transport processes largely rely on indirect information based on the interpretation of tracer tests. Geophysical techniques used in parallel with tracer tests can offer time-lapse images indicative of the migration of electrically-conductive tracers away from the injection location. In this study, we present a methodology to invert time-lapse ground penetrating radar reflection monitoring data acquired during a push-pull tracer test to infer fracture-scale transport patterns and aperture distribution. We do this by using a probabilistic inversion based on a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm. After demonstration on a synthetic dataset, we apply the new inversion method to field data. Our main findings are that the marginal distribution of local fracture apertures is well resolved and that the field site is characterized by strong flow channeling, which is consistent with interpretations of heat tracer tests in the same injection fracture.

TI Finland's cooperation in managing transboundary waters and the UNECE
   Principles for Effective Joint Bodies: Value for water diplomacy?
SO JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY

DT Article
DE UNECE principles; Joint bodies; Transboundary waters; Water agreements;
   Water diplomacy
AB Water diplomacy may be understood broadly as the measures that may be taken to prevent or peacefully resolve conflicts over water resources concerning their availability, allocation or use between and within states. The concept is preventive in nature as well as offering an approach for conflict resolution. Instruments of international water law, among them notably conventions and soft law developed on that basis - which promote equitable and reasonable use of transboundary waters and prevention of transboundary impact - can serve as tools for water diplomacy. The obligation to establish agreements on shared waters and joint bodies to govern them has contributed to gathering important experience, and some of this has been synthesized into the Principles for Effective Joint Bodies which were adopted by the Meeting of the Parties to the UNECE Water Convention in 2015. The Principles are intended as a resource to increase the effectiveness of joint bodies in transboundary water cooperation.
   This paper analyses Finland's cooperation arrangements in the light of the Principles and assesses the extent to which Finland's transboundary water commissions reflect the good practices specified in the Principles. Taking a wider perspective, the paper also examines the elements of the principles and their practical realisation with a view to understanding better their promotion of water diplomacy. Relevant features include, inter alia, the competency and representation of the joint institution, its accountability and the extent to which public participation is permitted, and the cooperative mechanisms in place. Naturally the underlying transboundary water agreements specify the framework for cooperation between the riparian states to a great extent, but the established joint bodies often play a significant role, specifically in the equitable use and management of the shared water resources, but even beyond, in the prevention and settling of conflicts, and in the general promotion of cooperation and security at a regional level.

AB The compound dry and hot event has attracted much attention in recent decades due to their disastrous impacts on different sectors. The impact from compound dry and hot events is generally more severe than that from individual dry or hot event. Understanding the physical mechanism of this compound event is thus of particular importance for early warning to reduce potential impacts. In this study, we quantitatively assessed the relationship between the occurrence of compound dry and hot events and El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) during the warm season at the global scale. Monthly precipitation and temperature from the Climatic Research Unit (CRU) were used to estimate the occurrence of compound events, and Nino 3.4 index (NINO34) was used to represent the ENSO phenomenon. The logistic regression model was employed to model the occurrence of compound events with respect to NINO34. Results from the logistic regression model showed that ENSO played an important role in the occurrence of compound dry and hot events during the warm season in regions such as northern part of South America, southern Africa, southeastern Asia and Australia. A higher likelihood of the occurrence of compound dry and hot events in these regions was shown to be associated with higher values of NINO34 based on empirical analysis from observations. Results from this study will help improve our understanding of compound dry and hot events and aid with mitigation efforts for ameliorating their adverse impacts.

AB Medium-low temperature geothermal resources are abundant in Southern China, but their heat source and link to fault zones is poorly understood. Consequently, geothermal energy is only used at small scale. In order to broaden the footprint of geothermal energy use in Southern China, it is first necessary to understand and track the geothermal groundwater circulation pattern associated with fault zones. The Heyuan Fault Zone serves as a typical medium-low temperature geothermal system of South China. Here we show that the geothermal groundwater circulation pattern can be traced by using stable hydrogen and oxygen isotopes, helium and neon isotopes, carbon-13 and carbon-14 as well as hydrochemical parameters. The results show that: in the Heyuan Fault Zone, the main hydrochemical type of the hot springs is HCO3-Na + K, while the shallow cold groundwater is mainly enriched in HCO3-Ca. The results of the helium isotope and neon isotope indicate that the geothermal groundwater of this area is derived from the crust, thus excluding the possibility of extremely deep paths of groundwater tapping into mantle helium sources. Furthermore, the characteristics of the stable hydrogen and oxygen isotopes imply that geothermal groundwater is of local meteoric origin, and the recharge area located at the hilly area of the hanging wall of the Heyuan main fault, with the recharge elevations ranging from about 440 m to 670 m. The hot spring geothermometer shows that the highest reservoir temperature is about 157 degrees C, and the deepest circulation depth is about 6500 m. Carbon-14 isotope age dating suggests that the geothermal groundwater ages are mostly from 9.9 kyr BP to 12.3 kyr BP. According to the geological structural characteristics of the study area, the main upward channel for geothermal groundwater is the Heyuan main fault. Generally, the hot springs in this area are mixed with shallow cold groundwater and surface water, which raises the ratio of the Ca2+ in water and dilutes the heavy hydrogen and oxygen isotopes.

AB Intertidal environments, including bare mudflats, tidal creeks, and vegetated salt marshes, are of significant physical and ecological importance in estuaries. Their morphodynamics are closely linked by mudflats and creek networks. Understanding water motion and sediment transport in mudflats and tidal creeks is fundamental to understand intertidal morphodynamics in intertidal environments. To explore dynamic interactions between tidal creeks and mudflats, we conducted field campaigns monitoring water depths, tidal currents, waves, suspended sediments, and bed-level changes at sites in both mudflats and tidal creeks in the Eastern Chongming tidal wetland in the Yangtze Delta for a full spring-neap tidal cycle. We saw that under fair weather conditions, the bed-level changes of the tidal creek site displayed a contrary trend compared with those of the mudflat site, indicating the source-sink relationship between tidal creek and mudflat. During over-marsh tides, the tidal creek site with relatively high bed shear stresses (averagely, 0.37 N/m(2)) was eroded by 35 mm whereas the mudflat site was accreted by 29 mm under low bed shear stresses (averagely, 0.18 N/m(2)). To the contrast, during creek-restricted tides, deposition occurred in the tidal creek site by 20 mm under low bed shear stresses (averagely, 0.09 N/m(2)) whereas erosion occurred in the mudflat site by 25 mm under relatively high bed shear stresses (averagely, 0.21 N/m(2)). Over a spring-neap tidal cycle, the net bed level changes were -15 mm (erosion) and 4 mm (deposition) in tidal creeks and mudflats, respectively. These results suggested that there were alternated erosion-deposition patterns in spring and neap tides, and a sediment source and sink shift between mudflats and creeks. We found that the eroded sediments in mudflats were transported landward into tidal creeks and deposited therein in neap tides, and these newly deposited sediments would be resuspended and transported to surrounding marshes (over-marsh deposition) at spring tides. The coherent sediment transport and associated erosion-deposition pattern within the mudflat-creek system at spring-neap tidal time scales thus played a fundamental role in intertidal morphodynamic development. These findings suggest that management and restoration of intertidal ecosystem need to take the entire mudflat-creek-marsh system as a unit into consideration rather than focusing on single elements.

AB Diurnal heat signal has been widely used to infer the seepage flux and thermal diffusivity in streambeds. The theoretical basis is the one-dimensional (1 - D) analytical solution of heat advection-dispersion equation with sinusoidal boundary condition and homogeneous initial condition (Stallman, 1965). However, the assumption of homogeneous initial condition made in Stallman (1965) is physically unrealistic and the assumption of steady flow is often violated when water level changes rapidly (e.g., flooding). To incorporate the realistic initial condition, an innovative solution for 1- D heat transport with sinusoidal boundary condition and arbitrary initial condition is proposed. This solution makes it possible to accurately simulate heat transport with transient flux by sequentially applying the new solution at small time interval. Synthetic temperature signals at different depth of streambeds are generated to study the impact of transient flux to the estimation of water flux and thermal diffusivity. Here are some major findings. Firstly, the calculated flux is sensitive to the flux dynamics. The faster the flux increases or decreases, the less accurate the calculated flux is. Secondly, using temperature time series from deep sensor pair is more likely to cause erroneous estimation of flux because heat signal damps fast with depth. Thirdly, the heat tracer method for estimating water flux is sensitive to the thermal properties of saturated sediments. Large thermal diffusivity leads to high uncertainty for flux estimation.

AB Identification of subregions that share similar historical drought variability provides useful information for drought monitoring, mitigation planning, and resource allocation. This study examined space-time historical drought variability for the Great Plains spanning from 1901 to 2015 by using rotated Empirical Orthogonal Functions (rEOFs). The Standardized Precipitation-Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) on a three-month timescale was utilized to examine spatial and temporal changes in agricultural drought. We propose a new procedure for identifying the number of rEOFs to be selected for reconstructing subregions. Drought event intensities of moderate, severe, and extreme categories increased in recent years although the number of drought events decreased. Seasonal rEOFs demonstrated that 9-12 subregions were adequate to explain a significant proportion of the original variability in the Great Plains. The time series for each subregion was highly correlated to the original SPEI data and reflected the seasonal meteorological processes that drive drought variability. Several significant wetting trends were found, and there was statistical evidence that drought and wetting event severities had increased for a few subregions. Summer drought has become more variable across space and time, indicating that a more diverse set of resources and strategies might be needed to mitigate impacts of spatially-variable drought and wetting events in coming decades. Winter season drought has become less variable, indicating that perhaps resources could be consolidated when dealing with impacts on a larger scale; however, less variability implies that drought and wetting events may occur across larger regions of the Great Plains during a given season.

AB The hydrological alterations induced by dam construction modify natural flora and fauna habitats and impair ecosystem stability. Although many studies have documented the impacts of large dams on streamflow, few have described the effects of small dam construction on hydrological conditions. The cumulative effects of intensive small dams may also cause severe ecological problems. To evaluate the impacts of dam construction on the indicators of hydrological alterations, a framework that combined a hydrological model and the post bias correction method was proposed. The hydrological alterations of two individual rivers in the Jiulong River basin that experienced impacts from intensifying small hydropower reservoirs, the North River and the West River, were analyzed using the proposed framework. The results show that the framework can successfully avoid misleading the impacts of dam construction on monthly runoff and multi-minimum values detected by the previously common method that did not separate the impacts of climate change and dam construction on flow regime. The small hydropower-dominated North River and the flood-control-dominated West River exhibited generally consistent change patterns of unchanging monthly river discharge, reduced high pulse count, reduced rise and fall rates, and increased number of reversals. Conversely, the changes to several Indicators of Hydrologic Alterations (IHA) differed between the two rivers. The flood-control-dominated West River exhibited 1) increased indicators, such as the base flow index, multi-day minimum flow and high pulse duration and 2) decreased multi-day maximum flow and low pulse count. Unlike the West River, the hydropower-dominated North River experienced 1) increased low pulse count and 2) decreased indicators such as multi-day minimum flow and low pulse duration. Our results implied that the ecological impacts of the small hydropower-dominated North River may exceed those of the flood-control-dominated West River. Therefore, the minimum ecological water demand should be considered not only in the large reservoirs operation, but also in the operation of small hydropower reservoirs.

AB Using monthly streamflow data from 9 gauging stations covering a period of 1960-2014 across the Huai River basin, China, the Pettitt method and GAMLSS model were used to quantify flood frequency and related implications for flood hazards. Results indicated that: (1) no significant change points were observed in flood flows at the Huangchuan, Hengpaitou and Bengbu stations. However, significant hydrological alterations were detected for flood flows at other 6 stations with change points during similar to 2000; (2) flood flows at the Bantai, Jiangjiaji and Hengpaitou stations were nonstationary but stationary flood flows were detected at other 6 stations. The Weibull distribution was the appropriate probability distribution describing flood flows across the Huai River basin and the lognormal distribution is the second best distribution; (3) no significant difference was detected for 10- and 20-year flood frequencies using the Pearson III type distribution function under the stationarity assumption. However, significant and increasing differences were expected for 30-, 50- and 100-year floods. It can be concluded that the assumption of stationarity, if the flood flows are actually nonstationary, can produce biased flood frequencies using Pearson III type distribution, and this result provides a critical reference for flood frequency analysis under the nonstationarity and/or stationarity assumption; (4) after 30 years, the flood magnification factor at Hengpaitou and Bengbu stations increased from 1 to 1.12 and from 1 to 1.06, respectively, implying higher flood risks at the Hengpaitou station. In addition, after 30 years, the return period of 100 year flood decreased from 100 years to less 70 years at the Hengpaitou station and from 100 years to nearly 78 years, implying higher frequency of floods with return periods of 100 years. Moreover, significant relations were detected between annual peak flood flow and flood-affected crop areas, implying that annual peak flood flow can be taken as an indicator of flood disasters across the Huai River basin and even in the Anhui province.

AB Bare soils and grasslands in arid and semi-arid conditions constitute a large portion of the earth surface. Evaporation, which is the main component of the water balance in these conditions, often takes place through a dry soil layer (DSL). There is no scientific agreement yet on the DSL effects on evaporation rates.
   The implementations of three conceptual models of DSL-evaporation were tested for the simulation of evaporation rates in a semi-arid study area in Central Spain: (i) the daily-average model, based on the assumption that the daily average vapour transport in a DSL can be represented in analogy to isothermal liquid flow; (ii) the numerical model solving the Richards equation, in this case HYDRUS1D was used; and (iii) the pore-scale model, based on soil column experiments in laboratory conditions. The evaporation rates estimated by the three conceptual models for semi-arid field conditions were compared with the evaporation rates measured by an eddy covariance tower in the same area.
   The results indicate that the daily-average conceptual model assumption, in which the DSL has no effects on evaporation, does not hold in very dry conditions. The numerical model solving the Richards equation was not able to simulate the effects of the DSL on evaporation rates. The evaporation estimates obtained by the pore-scale conceptual model were closest to the eddy covariance measurements during the dry season, however this model was applicable only to the relatively steady evaporation conditions during afternoons and only assuming spatially constant DSL thickness.

AB Quantifying the potential influence of climate change on future landslide hazard requires methodologies that allow to properly take into account nonstationarities in the hydro-meteorological causes.
   In this paper we provide a methodology for estimating return period of landslide triggering under climate change.
   The methodology capitalizes on the combined use of a stochastic rainfall generator and a hydrological and slope stability model. The stochastic rainfall generator takes into account the statistical dependency between rainfall event duration and intensity through copulas. The hydrological model is based on an analytical solution of a simplified version of the Richards vertical infiltration equation and slope stability is assessed by the infinite slope model. The combined model enables to estimate landslide probability through Monte Carlo simulations. Climate change is then introduced by perturbing the parameters of the rainfall stochastic generator based on factors of change derived from the comparison of future scenarios and the baseline climate as simulated by Regional climate models (RCMs). The Monte Carlo simulations are conducted sequentially on a future moving time window, to derive a yearly series of future landslide triggering probability. This series is then used to compute landslide return period by formulas suitable under nonstationary conditions.
   An application to the landslide prone region of the Peloritani Mountains, Southern Italy, is carried out to demonstrate the proposed approach. For the application, climate change projections of three RCMs of the MED-CORDEX initiative are used, and a preliminary assessment of the impacts of intermediate- and high-emission Representative concentration pathways (RCPs) 4.5 and 8.5 is carried out.

AB The magnitude of floods depends not only on the intensity and pattern of precipitation during the flood event (the 'flood-producing' precipitation), but also on the moisture stored in the catchment, which arises from antecedent hydrological processes over many preceding timescales. To characterise this effect, an empirical study is conducted on the influence of antecedent precipitation on significant flood events across multiple climate zones and catchment conditions, using 100 Australian catchments with hourly streamflow and precipitation. Antecedent conditions are shown to have a significant influence on flood volume, with three quarters of catchments having at least a 50% difference in flood volume depending on whether the catchment is wet or dry before the flood-producing precipitation event. The study considers the sensitivity of flow to antecedent precipitation by means of an 'elasticity' metric, which indicates the proportional change in flow for a change in antecedent precipitation or flood-producing precipitation. Flood-producing precipitation nevertheless remains the dominant flood driver across most catchments, with the elasticity of flow to antecedent precipitation typically being between 28% and 37% of the elasticity to flood-producing precipitation. Importantly, the elasticity of flow to antecedent precipitation relative to flood-producing precipitation decreases with increasing event magnitude, highlighting that conclusions of future change based on annual maximum streamflow may not be reflective of the processes that operate for more extreme floods that have the greatest impact on society.

AB We present a joint Bayesian inverse method for analyzing conservative and reactive tracer data, which estimates non-parametric transfer functions and effective first-order reaction rate coefficients simultaneously. A stochastic sampling approach based on Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods was used to simulate samples from the posteriors, with a Metropolis within Gibbs sampler used for transfer functions and reaction rate coefficients. Non-negativity constraints were realized by choosing a reflected Gaussian prior for the transfer function and a lognormal prior for the reaction rate coefficient. The approach was tested by synthetic sparse datasets with introduced normal random errors or periodic errors, and then it was applied to the tracer test data collected at Oak Ridge National Laboratory. The results indicate that the developed approach was well capable of characterizing anomalous transfer functions, such as multi-modal functions, and quantifying the uncertainty of both transfer functions and reaction rate coefficients. In particular, compared with the approach of individual inversion of sparse data, the joint inversion approach taking advantage of the sharing of information regarding transport processes across the conservative tracer and reactive tracer data leads to the improved estimation of transfer functions and reaction rate coefficients for sparse datasets.

AB We define model-data interaction (MDI) as a two way process between models and data, in which on one hand data can serve the modeling purpose by supporting model discrimination, parameter refinement, uncertainty analysis, etc., and on the other hand models provide a tool for data fusion, interpretation, interpolation, etc. MDI has many applications in the realm of groundwater and has been the topic of extensive research in the groundwater community for the past several decades. This has led to the development of a multitude of increasingly sophisticated methods. The progress of data acquisition technologies and the evolution of models are continuously changing the landscape of groundwater MDI, creating new challenges and opportunities that must be properly understood and addressed. This paper aims to review, analyze and classify research on MDI in groundwater applications, and discusses several related aspects including: (1) basic theoretical concepts and classification of methods, (2) sources of uncertainty and how they are commonly addressed, (3) specific characteristics of groundwater models and data that affect the choice of methods, (4) how models and data can interact to provide added value in groundwater applications, (5) software and codes for MDI, and (6) key issues that will likely form future research directions. The review shows that there are many tools and techniques for groundwater MDI, and this diversity is needed to support different MDI objectives, assumptions, model and data types and computational constraints. The study identifies eight categories of applications for MDI in the groundwater literature, and highlights the growing gap between MDI practices in the research community and those in consulting, industry and government.

AB Although rainfall characteristics play important roles in runoff generation and soil erosion, our understanding about how rainfall moving direction impacts surface flow and soil erosion on slopes considering spatial process of soil surface sealing is still poor. In this study, a series of laboratory experiments was conducted using a soil flume and a movable rainfall simulator to investigate this impact. Two rainfall moving directions (i.e. upslope-moving and downslope-moving) and two soil surface moisture conditions (i.e. dry runs with no antecedent rainfall and wet runs with antecedent rainfall) were considered in the experiments with different slope gradients and rainfall intensities. The results showed that the upslope-moving rainfalls generated more surface flow from 25% to 700% and less soil erosion than the downslope-moving rainfalls in the dry runs due to the different spatial developing processes of soil surface sealing. The difference between the runoff coefficients of the two moving direction rainfalls decreased remarkably (more than 50%) with slope gradient increasing from 15 degrees to 25 degrees. In the wet runs, surface flow was similar for the upslope-moving and downslope-moving rainfalls, as all of the soil surface had been sealed before the experiments. Soil erosion in the downslope-moving rainfalls was larger than that in the upslope-moving rainfalls due to higher sediment transport capability of the surface flow. For both rainfall moving directions with same rainfall conditions, the total soil erosion in a dry run was mostly larger than that in a wet run because of less erodible soil particles on the sealed slope in the wet run. The result of this study implied that different rainfall moving directions can lead to distinct spatial processes of soil surface sealing and caused large differences in surface flow and soil erosion processes on slopes.

AB Projected droughts for 21st century over India have been analysed using precipitation and temperature data obtained from Regional Climate Models (RCMs) under Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) 4.5 and 8.5. Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI), Standardized effective Precipitation Evapo-Transpiration Index (SP*ETI) and Standardized Precipitation-Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) at the timescale of 12-months have been used for drought characterization. The K-means clustering algorithm has been utilized to delineate distinct drought homogeneous regions in India. Trends and periodicities in drought characteristics have also been analysed. The results of this study reveal that increase in evapotranspiration due to projected rise in temperature would play a major role in affecting future drought dynamics in most parts of India. Analysis indicates that computed magnitude of drought intensity, duration and frequency depends on the choice of drought indicator. SPEI drought index has been found to project highest drought risk as compared to other two indices used in this study. North India is more vulnerable to increase in drought severity and frequency in near future. However in far future, most parts of the country, except few southeastern states, are likely to face an escalation in drought severity and frequency. A shift in drought hazard from central India toward southeast-central India is likely to happen with increase in greenhouse gas (GHG) concentration. The areal extent of droughts has been found to be increasing historically which is expected to increase further in future for most parts of the country. Historically, drought dynamics were more influenced by decrease in precipitation. However, in future, the drought dynamics will be significantly influenced by increased evapotranspiration resulting from increase in temperature in spite of likely increase in precipitation. The periodicity analysis indicates inter-annual periodicities influencing monsoon months to be distributed uniformly across all clusters of the Indian subcontinent with dominant cycles of 2-3.6 years. Further, change in periodic cycles of drought due to climate change is found to be insignificant.

AB Numerous large river basins of the world have few and irregular observations of the components of the terrestrial hydrological cycle with the exception of stream gauges at a few locations and at the outlet along with sparsely distributed rain gauges. Using observations from satellite sensors and output from global land surface models, it is possible to study these under-observed river basins. With populations greater than a billion people, some of these rivers (e.g., the Ganga-Brahmaputra, the Yangtze, the Nile and the Mekong) are the economic engines of the countries they transect, yet thorough assessment of their flow dynamics and variability in regard to water resource management is still lacking. In this paper, we use soil moisture (0-2 m) and surface runoff from the NASA Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS), evapotranspiration, and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and rainfall from the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) and total water storage anomaly from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) to examine variability of individual water balance components. To this end, understanding the inter-annual and intra-seasonal variability and the spatial variability of the water balance components in the major river basins of the world will help to plan for improved management of water resources for the future.

AB Moving water can transport temperature signals of surface water into groundwater or vice-versa. We analyzed the temperature signals in the atmosphere, river, and pumped water to elucidate source water contributions to the pumping wells from the ambient groundwater and the river. Temperature fluctuations in response to high-frequency intermittent pumping were observed from February 2014 to August 2016 in 14 wells within three shallow unconfined alluvial aquifers along the Ohio River. The groundwater temperature observed in pumping wells displayed two alternating signals between pump-on and pump-off periods. The difference in groundwater temperatures between pump-on and pump-off periods was defined as a temperature shift. Temperature shifts indicate that pumping always introduces water of different temperature to the wells than that of the ambient groundwater. While seasonal pump-off temperatures varied up to 3.2 degrees C, the short-term temperature shifts ranged from 0.2 to 2.5 degrees C. Groundwater was generally warm in winter and cold in summer, but pumped water was of lower temperature in winter and higher in summer than the ambient groundwater. However, the pumping-induced temperature shifts were highest in summer and winter and lowest in spring and fall because groundwater temperature lagged that of surface water by approximately six months. The thermal transfer velocity in groundwater was more than one order magnitude higher during pumping than that during the recovery periods. High-frequency pumping changed produced-water temperature and increased the thermal transfer velocity in the groundwater. These results indicate that stream exfiltration is a major component of the water budget to a number of these wells. Thermal analysis reveals that the temperature of pumped water can trace source water to the pumping wells. This thermal approach for estimating the source of pumped water works best when groundwater temperature variation is seasonally large.

AB Flood processes in catchments are driven by a combination of rainfall and landscape characteristics. Upland peatlands are source areas of flooding but there is lack of understanding of how different rainfall intensities and temporal patterns may interact with land-cover configurations to influence flood peaks. Using spatially distributed (SD-) TOPMODEL we investigated these interactions for a case study peatland catchment. For each of four rainfall depths ranging from 20 mm to 50 mm, four storm rainfall patterns were applied (rainfall that was uniform, rainfall with an early peak intensity during the storm, middle peak and late peak). Late peak rainfall resulted in the highest river flow peaks at the catchment outlet studied, followed by middle and early rainfall peak patterns, while uniform rainfall through time gave the lowest flow peaks. A key factor was synchroneity of overland flow movement and concentration. The impact on river flow peaks of land-cover change on riparian zones and on gentle gradient slopes was larger than that for other parts of the catchment under different rainfall intensities and patterns. The impacts of land-cover change on proportional change in flood peaks in these sensitive areas became smaller when rainfall intensity increased, but absolute changes in flow peaks became larger. Land-cover change in sensitive areas under middle and late peak rainfall had a larger impact on river flow peaks than for early peak rainfall. It was possible to identify the 'worst' rainfall patterns for a particular case of land-cover change which may be useful for practitioners to help manage expectations of flood response to nature-based solutions.

AB In order to better define the characteristics of a karst conduit, an integrated hydrogeological study including numerical modeling using CFPv2 is conducted at a karst aquifer in the Zagros Mountain Region of Iran. The Sarvak limestone aquifer in the Nil Anticline is the main karst aquifer of the study area with major groundwater discharge taking place at Sarkur spring. An annual water balance and a dye tracing test confirmed that the karst system is mainly recharged through rainfall and the Maroon River. Several depressions are observed along the banks of the river with a major one classified as a sinkhole used for dye injection. A groundwater flow model was developed based on the available hydrogeological information. A probable direct conduit flow path with an estimated groundwater flow velocity of 96 m/h is estimated between the injection point and the Sarkur spring. Four scenarios are assumed to simulate the probable conduit flow path using the CFPv2 code. As one of the first attempts in regional groundwater flow modeling of a karst aquifer, CFPv2 is automatically calibrated with field measurements of spring discharge and a dye breakthrough curve through a parameter estimation code OSTRICH to optimize the characteristics of the conduit through the minimization of the weighted sum of square error. Simulated results reveal that a conduit with a diameter of 2.9 m is required to adequately simulate spring discharge and dye tracer migration between the injection and discharge points. Our new approach (linking of CFPv2 and OSTRICH) provides a deeper understanding of groundwater flow and solute transport in karst terrains even when available data are limited and the approach should be applicable to other areas.

AB The climate change and human activities can principally doubt the frequency analysis methods which assume that the hydrological events are stationary. The Pearson type 3 (P3) distribution, which has been widely applied in frequency analysis under the stationary condition, was developed for the nonstationary cases. The distribution parameters can be expressed as exponential or polynomial functions with time or other covariates. Parameter estimation for the nonstationary P3 model was done with the penalized maximum likelihood estimation (PMLE) method in which we applied a restrictive penalty on the location parameter to avoid unreasonable results. The results of the nonstationary P3 model were compared to that of the generalized extreme value (GEV) distribution, in which the generalized maximum likelihood estimation (GMLE) method was applied to estimate the parameters. The Monte Carlo simulations indicated that the nonstationary P3 model provided better results than the nonstationary GEV model for different sample sizes. Both models were also applied in hydrological series with various trends and record lengths to prove the feasibility of the nonstationary P3 model in practical applications. The applications showed that the nonstationary P3 model performed better than the nonstationary GEV model in most of the studied cases.

AB Macropore flow is a ubiquitous hydrologic process that has not been well explained using traditional hydrologic theories. In particular, macropore flow velocity (MFV) is poorly understood with respect to its typical ranges and controlling factors. Here we conducted a meta-analysis based on an MFV dataset compiled from 243 measurements documented in 76 journal articles. The dataset includes MFV values measured using different approaches across the soil-core, field-profile, and trench scales. Our analyses show that MFV has a geometric mean of 1.08 x 10(-3) m s(-1), which is about 2 similar to 3 orders of magnitude larger than the corresponding values of saturated hydraulic conductivity in the soil matrix. Using machine learning methods including classification and regression tree and random forests algorithms, we identified observation scale, travel distance, rainfall intensity and macropore diameter as the most important factors that control MFV. MFV is much larger at the trench scale than at the other two scales mainly due to abundant large macropores. Correlation analysis and multivariate regression revealed that (1) MFV and rainfall intensity have significant positive correlation, which indicates that MFV is a dynamic variable; and (2) MFV and macropore diameter also have strong positive correlation at the trench scale, which indicates macropore size as a key controlling factor. Using macropore diameter and rainfall intensity as explanatory factors, MFV can be well predicted (R-2 = 0.76) by a multivariate regression equation at trench-scale, implying that rainfall intensity can be considered a proxy for the filling degree of macropores. Furthermore, both the Poiseuille and Manning equations were found to overestimate the MFV values, suggesting a parameter representing the connectivity of the macropore network is needed for providing reasonable estimates of MFV using physically-based equations.

AB Wedge-shaped aquifers are usually formed where two linear boundaries intersect. These types of aquifers are commonly seen in river basins and alluvial fans, but have received much less attention in the hydrological sciences community. Fundamental understanding of the effects of lateral boundaries on the hydrodynamic process in such aquifers is quite poor, particularly for unconfined-fractured and leaky wedge-shaped aquifer systems, which will be the concern of this study. Solutions of flow to a well in an unconfined-fractured wedge-shaped two aquifer system are obtained using Laplace, Hankel and Fourier transforms. An infinitesimal radius pumping well partially penetrates the overlying unconfined aquifer. Both aquifer layers are homogeneous and anisotropic bounded by two intersecting linear lateral boundaries of constant-head or barrier types and the aquifer system is semi-infinite in radial direction. The time domain drawdowns are obtained via the Stehfest algorithm and Gaussian Quadrature. The inter-porosity flow in the underlying fracture aquifer, the instantaneous water table drainage, the horizontal and vertical hydraulic conductivity anisotropy and the wedge angle are taken into account. Eliminating the inter-porosity flow in the underlying fractured aquifer, the presented solution reduces to a leaky wedge-shaped aquifer case. The influences of the underlying fractured aquifer hydraulic parameters on the overlying unconfined aquifer for different wedge angles and linear lateral boundaries types are explored using dimensionless drawdown and scaled sensitivity curves. The results of this study can be utilized to obtain hydraulic parameters of an alluvial and river basin unconfined-fractured wedge-shaped aquifer systems. The presented solution can also be used for water budget assessment of river basin aquifers.

AB This study investigates the efficiency of correcting radar rainfall estimates using a stochastic error model in the upper Iguacu river basin in Southern Brazil for improving streamflow simulations. The 2-Dimensional Satellite Rainfall Error Model (SREM2D) is adopted here and modified to account for topographic complexity, seasonality, and distance from the radar. SREM2D was used to correct the radar rainfall estimates and produce an ensemble of equally probable rainfall fields, that were then used to force a distributed hydrological model. Systematic and random errors in simulated streamflow were evaluated for a cascade of sub-basins of the Iguacu catchment, with drainage area ranging from 1,808 to 21,536 km(2)). Results showed an improvement in the statistical metrics when the SREM2D ensemble was used as input to the hydrological model in place of the radar rainfall estimates in most sub-basins. Specifically, SREM2D was able to remove the relative bias (up to 50%) in the radar rainfall dataset regardless of the basin dimension, whereas the random error was reduced more prominently in the larger basins (up to 100 m(3) s(-1)). An event scale evaluation was also performed for nine selected flood events in three sub-basins. SREM2D reduced the overestimation in the cumulative rainfall and streamflow volumes during these events.

AB For accurate flash flood forecasting and effective stormwater planning and management in urban areas, it is necessary to model not only the natural channel systems but also the large and complex networks of storm drains. In this work, we describe a modular storm drain model that can easily be coupled with existing gridded distributed hydrologic models for real-time flash flood forecasting, and stormwater planning and management for large urban areas ( > 100 km(2)). A salient feature of our approach is the use of the equivalent storm drain network (ESDN) which approximates the actual network on the same grid as that of the distributed hydrologic model, thereby rendering coupling simple and modular. In the integrated model, storm-drain flow occurs through the simplified network coarsened to the resolution of the distributed hydrologic model without full 1D-2D dynamics or very detailed man-made structures and features modeled. The integrated model is applied to a 144.6 km(2) area of five urban catchments in the Cities of Arlington and Grand Prairie in Texas, US. Comparisons at selected locations using kinematic-wave flow simulations show that the ESDN approximates the flow through the original network very well with attendant savings in computational amount and reduction in modeling complexities. The impact of the storm drain network is assessed via a combination of simulation experiments, sensitivity analysis and limited comparison with observed flow. It is shown that the storm drain network in highly urbanized catchments in the study area is very effective in reducing surface flow at most locations for about 30 min following onset of significant rainfall, that the existing stormwater infrastructure would lose effectiveness for approximately 30% of the study area with a 15% increase in imperviousness relative to the current conditions, and that significant uncertainties exist in partitioning of surface flow into storm drain and natural channel flows due to sensitivity to inlet flow modeling. With greatly reduced computing cost and modeling complexity, the proposed approach offers a practical solution for integrated stormwater modeling for large urban areas for a wide range of applications. The proposed approach cannot, however, resolve flow at sub-grid scales and hence is not appropriate for very detailed modeling for small areas.

   For nearly a century, some of the riparian states have developed parts of the basin in their territories - to great benefits and harm - and recently the remaining late developing countries are catching up with water and related resources development plans to dam, withdraw and use the mighty Mekong to fund national progress and alleviate poverty.
   World leaders, academics, NGOs, media and even some government officials have warned that the current rush to development is not only bringing a sure death to a great previously untamed river, potentially displacing millions of people, and threatening livelihoods, but would also usher in an era of aggravated tensions and possibly even conflict. The Mekong River Commission (MRC), tasked to manage the river for the sake of the environment and the people, is failing its mission with work that has been ineffective, uninfluential and wasted, critics say.
   Yet this scenario is both wrong in its thesis about Mekong development and misleading in its understanding of MRC's role and work. While past and current water resources development in the region has brought challenges and risks associated with changes in the river system, these have not led to widespread destruction of livelihoods and conflict among riparian countries.
   A critical factor preventing conflict and managing tensions as well as supporting optimal and sustainable development is the MRC and its water diplomacy framework, which has a technical core to provide objective scientific advices and legal, institutional and strategic mechanisms that facilitate and support negotiated solutions to complex water and related problems. While challenges remain for the MRC as an organization, its water diplomacy framework has gradually been established and strengthened as the cases of managing tensions and potential conflicts in the Mekong for the past twenty years illustrate.

AB A hydrologic model, calibrated using only streamflow data, can produce acceptable streamflow simulation at the watershed outlet yet unrealistic representations of water balance across the landscape. Recent studies have demonstrated the potential of multi-objective calibration using remotely sensed evapotranspiration (ET) and gaged streamflow data to spatially improve the water balance. However, methodological clarity on how to "best" integrate ET data and model parameters in multi-objective model calibration to improve simulations is lacking. To address these limitations, we assessed how a spatially explicit, distributed calibration approach that uses (1) remotely sensed ET data from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and (2) frequently overlooked biophysical parameters can improve the overall predictability of two key components of the water balance: streamflow and ET at different locations throughout the watershed. We used the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT), previously modified to represent hydrologic transport and filling-spilling of landscape depressions, in a large watershed of the Prairie Pothole Region, United States. We employed a novel stepwise series of calibration experiments to isolate the effects (on streamflow and simulated ET) of integrating biophysical parameters and spatially explicit remotely sensed ET data into model calibration. Results suggest that the inclusion of biophysical parameters involving vegetation dynamics and energy utilization mechanisms tend to increase model accuracy. Furthermore, we found that using a lumped, versus a spatially explicit, approach for integrating ET into model calibration produces a sub-optimal model state with no potential improvement in model performance across large spatial scales. However, when we utilized the same MODIS ET datasets but calibrated each sub-basin in the spatially explicit approach, water yield prediction uncertainty decreased, including a distinct improvement in the temporal and spatial accuracy of simulated ET and streamflow. This further resulted in a more realistic simulation of vegetation growth when compared to MODIS Leaf-Area Index data. These findings afford critical insights into the efficient integration of remotely sensed "big data" into hydrologic modeling and associated watershed management decisions. Our approach can be generalized and potentially replicated using other hydrologic models and remotely sensed data resources - and in different geophysical settings of the globe.

AB The estimates of actual evapotranspiration (E) across basins and/or regions are still facing some difficulties because of the complex interactions amongst the components of the land-plant-atmosphere system, even though the basic physical mechanism of E is well understood. Presenting as a nonlinear relationship constrained by physical limits, the Budyko framework serves as a powerful tool used to estimate the averaged E at long-term scale. Given the ability of Gravity Recovery And Climate Experiment (GRACE) in effectively simulating the terrestrial water storage change (Delta TWS) at monthly scale, a model to estimate E was developed based on the Budyko framework with mean monthly parameter of multi-years, and was applied to the estimation of E for the 24 selected catchments in different climatic regions across China. Results indicate that for the majority of 24 catchments, the positive or negative trends in precipitation (P), potential evapotranspiration (E-0), runoff (R) and Delta TWS were not statistically significant during 2003-2013 at both annual and monthly scales, but the Delta TWS occupied a large proportion in the partitioning of P into R and E at monthly scale. The monthly Budyko parameter showed large variation within the year and also across these 24 catchments. The Budyko-modeled monthly E (Budyko-E) represented the GRACE-derived ones (GRACE-E) across these catchments well with both modeled E volumes and hydrograph shapes which were also consistent with GRACE-E series except some underestimation for peak E. Overall, the Budyko-E represented GRACE-E in the arid and semi-arid catchments comparatively better than it in the humid and semi-humid catchments due to the larger proportion of Delta TWS in the P partition. Among all the 24 selected catchments, the monthly Budyko-type E model represented the GRACE-E across Shixiali catchment (located in the Hai River basin) best, with the correlation coefficient (r), Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient (NSCE) and relative error (RE) between GRACE-E and simulated results being 0.996, 0.988, - 0.033 in calibration and 0.994, 0.951, - 0.111 in validation, respectively. Furthermore, using GRACE-E as the benchmark values, the Budyko-E outperformed four other global E products from the newly published Global Land Data Assimilation System with Noah Land Surface Model-2 (GLDAS_E), MODIS (MODIS_E), Japanese 25-year reanalysis product (JRA_E), and Zhang's method (Zhang_E). GLDAS_E was the best of four global E products at reproducing monthly variations, with relatively high r and NSCE values, small RE. While MODIS_E showed the poorest performance in reproducing the inter-annual E variations of these catchments, which was reflected by low r and NSCE values. This extended Budyko-E model can apply in other similar climatic regions and also may provide skill in evaluating the water resources since the preferable accuracy of E estimate.

AB Global satellite precipitation products, such as Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) and its successor, Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM), have provided hydrologists with a critical precipitation data source for hydrological applications in data-sparse or ungauged basins. This study conducts a comparative analysis on the quality of the TRMM Multi-satellite Precipitation Analysis 3B42V7 and the Integrated Multi-satellite Retrievals for GPM (IMERG) Final Run version 05 precipitation products and their hydrological utilities in the Yellow River source region (YRSR), a mountainous Alpine region in northwestern China, from April 2014 to December 2016. Results indicate that when evaluated against the ground precipitation observations, IMERG generally improves the daily precipitation estimates relative to its predecessor 3B42V7. In addition, and the correlation coefficients (CCs) of IMERG (0.328 and 0.527) are significantly higher at grid and basin scales than those of 3B42V7 (0.287 and 0.458). However, the 3-hourly precipitation estimates from both products poorly correlate with the ground observations at grid and basin scales. By using the grid-based Xinanjiang (GXAJ) hydrological model calibrated with the gauge-based precipitation for daily streamflow simulations, the 3B42V7-driven model run shows acceptable hydrological simulation skill with regard to the Nash-Sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient (NSE = 0.729), whereas IMERG demonstrates improved performance (NSE = 0.810), which is comparable with the gauge-based simulation (NSE = 0.807). Input-specific model recalibration effectively enhances the hydrological performance of both satellite products (NSE = 0.856 for IMERG and NSE = 0.840 for 3B42V7). Additionally, the gauge-benchmarked GXAJ model with 3B42V7 has limited hydrological skill in simulating three historical flood events at 3-hourly time intervals (NSE = - 0.070 to 0.702), while IMERG has a slightly better performance (NSE = 0.266-0.792). Model recalibration also significantly improves the simulations of two out of three flood events, and the NSE skill cores of IMERG (0.581-0.901) and 3B42V7 (-0.795 to 0.852) are relatively lower than that of the gauge-based simulation (0.753-0.969) but comparable. Overall, the IMERG and 3B43V7 satellite precipitation products can be adopted as reliable precipitation sources for hydrological simulations at daily and sub-daily time scales in the study area, with IMERG better suited than 3B42V7. Considering that the low CC values exist in both IMERG and 3B42V7 products, in particular, at a subdaily temporal scale, the GPM research community should further improve the calibration algorithms and enhance the quality of IMERG products in YRSR. Performing bias-correction of satellite precipitation products is also necessary for hydrological modelers to effectively improve their hydrological utilities.

AB In this paper, a novel Laplace-transform boundary element model for pumping tests in irregularly shaped double-porosity aquifers is presented. The aquifer could be associated with various boundary conditions, such as the general Robin boundary conditions or even the mixed boundary conditions with no-flow boundary on one side and constant head boundary on the other side. The derived solution has analytical characteristics since it is obtained through the Green's function method within the domain. Unlike traditional numerical methods, the proposed solution using the Laplace-transform boundary element method does not require discretization in spatial and temporal dimensions. In this study, boundary integral equation using Green's second theorem and the fundamental solution of Green function for dual-porosity models are given. A boundary element matrix in Laplace space is established, which allow us to consider irregularly shaped boundary. The drawdown and flux on the boundary can be obtained through solving the boundary element matrix by Gauss's elimination method. The final solution for wellbore drawdown is evaluated using numerical Laplace inversion algorithm of Stehfest (1970). Many previous solutions for transient flow in finite single-porosity aquifers with no-flow outer boundary condition are shown to be special cases of the present solution. Furthermore, the solution with a mixed outer boundary condition is used to investigate the effect of important parameters of aquifers on wellbore drawdown, including fracture storage coefficient, inter-porosity flow coefficient from matrix to fissures, boundary shape, boundary location, and interference of multiple wells.

AB Short term studies have found that stormwater biofiltration systems, also known as bioretention systems or raingardens, are very effective in reducing heavy metal concentrations. However, their long-term treatment performance, as well as the spatial and temporal accumulation of metals within these systems remain uncertain. This paper reports on a large scale field study that assessed the changes over time of cadmium (Cd), copper (Cu), lead (Pb), and zinc (Zn) levels in biofilters varying in age, design, and catchment characteristics. The survey incorporated 29 biofilters in 2006/7 and 49 biofilters, in 2014/15, located in three major Australian cities (Melbourne, Brisbane, and Sydney). Noting that these results are influenced by having just one industrial site with 25 filters measured at that site Catchment characteristics were significantly correlated with metal accumulation rates. Biofilters in catchments with current or past industrial activities had elevated heavy metal concentrations in the filter media. Zinc concentrations in the surface 0-100 mm exceed both soil quality and ecological guidelines. In contrast, heavy metal concentrations in residential catchments are unlikely to (ever) reach levels that exceed soil quality guidelines for human health, although zinc concentrations approach ecological guideline criteria.

Considering this, a study was conducted in the arid and semi-arid parts of middle Awash in Ethiopia using reflectance and radiance satellite datasets of both Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Landsat's Operational Land Imager (OLI) sensors. The SEBS model e derived AET was compared with the CWR computed from ground (observed) meteorological datasets. The results revealed that the amount of AET over the study area was dependent on temperature, surface radiative property, moisture content and crop development stage. The AET derived from satellite datasets was strongly related to the ground computed CWR over the irrigated sugarcane and cotton fields. The study revealed that the technique could be of great help during irrigation management, water conservation and allocation. Hence, we recommend decision makers of the commercial farms to further explore the use of this technique to properly manage and schedule their irrigation. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB While the application of neural networks for groundwater level forecasting in general has been investigated by many authors, the use of nonlinear autoregressive networks with exogenous inputs (NARX) is relatively new. For this work NARX were applied to obtain groundwater level forecasts for several wells in southwest Germany. Wells in porous, fractured and karst aquifers were investigated and forecasts of lead times up to half a year were conducted for both influenced (e.g. nearby pumping) and uninfluenced wells. Precipitation and temperature were chosen as predictors, which makes the selected approach easily transferable, since both parameters are widely available and simple to measure. Input and feedback delays were determined by applying STL time series decomposition on the data and using autoand cross-correlation functions on the remainders to determine significant time lags. Coefficient of determination, (relative) root mean squared error and Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency were used to evaluate forecasts, the model selection was based on an out-of-sample validation on rolling basis. The results are promising and indicate an outstanding suitability of NARX for groundwater level predictions with such a small set of inputs in all three aquifer types. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB The ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) has been widely applied to assimilate dynamic data such as hydraulic head in geologic models for improved predictions over the past decade. It has various advantages such as the capability of handling multiple sources of uncertainty and ease of coupling with forward simulators involving complex physics; however, it is not reliable for updating models that are characterized by curvilinear structures such as in fluvial deposits where high-permeability conduits play a dominant role for solute transport. Several methods have been proposed to handle non-Gaussian aspects in the EnKF. For instance, the EnKF has been coupled with the normal-score transform (NS-EnKF) for data assimilation in non-multi-Gaussian distributed conductivity fields, and this approach has been applied in a number of studies. As an alternative to the EnKF, the iterative ensemble smoother (ES) has been proposed for data assimilation, where all the data at all time steps are integrated into geologic models together, instead of the sequential data integration of the EnKF. The ES therefore has much less computational cost than the EnKF. This work coupled the normal-score transform and ensemble smoother (NS-ES) for data assimilation in non-multi-Gaussian distributed conductivity fields. The algorithm is compared to the NS-EnKF and evaluated in a synthetic bimodal aquifer. The results show that (1) the NS-ES is able to reproduce the curvilinear structures of the reference field, and the performance of updated models using the NSES is improved in terms of flow and transport predictions; and (2) the NS-ES can obtain results comparable to the NS-EnKF for characterization of non-multi-Gaussian conductivities, and has the advantage of less computational cost.

AB It remains a challenge to obtain an accurate middle and long-term runoff forecast, especially in flood seasons. The forecast performance can be improved using ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) to produce cleaner signals as model inputs. In many EEMD based forecast models, the entire time series are decomposed into several sub-series, and each sub-series is divided into calibration and validation datasets and forecasted by some common models, such as artificial neural network (ANN), and finally an ensemble forecast is obtained by summing the forecasted results of each sub-series. In such a decomposition-ensemble framework, some future information is used, and thus it is a hindcast experiment. Attempts have also been made to propose a real forecast experiment, which, however, often cannot be able to adapt to the non-stationary changes in runoff due to the lack of adaptive ability. Therefore, this study tries to improve the decomposition-ensemble framework and propose an adaptive middle and long-term runoff forecast model especially for flood seasons. Unlike a hindcast experiment, it does not use any future information; and unlike conventional forecast experiments, its decomposition and forecast models are adjusted adaptively as long as new runoff information is added. EEMD is used to decompose the original time series and ANN is used to forecast each sub-series, hence the name an adaptive EEMD-ANN (AEEMD-ANN) model. This model is applied to forecast the 1-month ahead streamfiow of three stations in China, and the results show that the AEEMD-ANN model can improve forecast accuracy in flood seasons, but it is not as good as ANN, adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS), support vector machine (SVM) and seasonal first-order autoregressive (SAR (1)) models in dry seasons. While the conventional forecast models, especially the SAR (1) models, are more suitable in dry season. Therefore, it is recommended to use SAR (1) model in dry season and AEEMD-ANN model in flood season to forecast the monthly runoff in Yangtze River Basin. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This paper proposes an integrated (hybrid) Artificial Neural Network-Bayesian (ANN-B) modelling approach to improve the accuracy of predicting seasonal water allocation prices in Australia's Murry Irrigation Area, which is part of one of the world's largest interconnected water markets. Three models (basic, intermediate and full), accommodating different levels of data availability, were considered. Data were analyzed using both ANN and hybrid ANN-B approaches. Using the ANN-B modelling approach, which can simulate complex and non-linear processes, water allocation prices were predicted with a high degree of accuracy (R-BASIC = 0.93, R-INTER. = 0.96 and R-FULL = 0.99); this was a higher level of accuracy than realized using ANN. This approach can potentially be integrated with online data systems to predict water allocation prices, enable better water allocation trade decisions, and improve the productivity and profitability of irrigated agriculture.

AB Sewer overflow is a priority concern for many cities. Owing to the high density of buildings and populations, constructing new storage tanks in urban areas is getting more and more difficult. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel Inter Catchment Wastewater Transfer (ICWT) method for sewer overflow mitigation. The ICWT method aims at redistributing the spatial mismatched sewer flow according to the treatment capacity of Wastewater Treatment Plant (WWTP). Three tasks are involved in the development of ICWT. First, test the effectiveness of ICWT. Second, study how to properly redistribute inflow to the WWTP. Third, the operation of ICWT highly depends on inflow to the WWTP, to support the management of ICWT, it is imperative to construct a flow rate prediction model. A hydraulic model is used for task 1 and 2, individual and combined effects of the storage tank and ICWT on sewer overflow are investigated. The simulation results show that less overflow is obtained. In considering the deficiencies of hydraulic model, one of the most promising deep learning techniques, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), is employed to undertake task 3. Experiments demonstrated that LSTM could be of great use in predicting sewer flow. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Climate change will modify the availability of groundwater resources in the future. Thus the evaluation of average aquifer recharge from precipitation, and its uncertainty, becomes a key subject in determining suitable countrywide water policies. The confident prediction of renewable groundwater resources requires an accurate evaluation of aquifer recharge over time and space, especially in large territories with varied conditions for aquifer recharge such as continental Spain. This study asses impacts of future potential climatic change scenarios on distributed net aquifer recharge (NAR) from precipitation over continental Spain. For this, the used method (1) generates future time series of climatic variables (precipitation, temperature) spatially distributed over the territory for potential aquifer recharge (PAR), and (2) simulates them within previously calibrated spatial PAR or NAR recharge models from the available historical information to provide distributed PAR or NAR time series. The information employed comes from the Spain02 project for the historical climatic data, from Alcala and Custodio (2014, 2015) for the historical spatial NAR, and from the CORDEX EU project (2013) regional climate models (RCMs) simulations for the future climate scenarios. A distributed empirical precipitation-recharge model is defined by using a regular 10 km x 10 km grid, and assuming that precipitation (P) and temperature (T) are the most important climatic variables determining PAR, while their spatiotemporal variabilities determine the impacts of future potential climatic scenarios on renewable groundwater resources. Potential plausible pictures of future climate scenarios are defined by combining information coming from different RCMs and General Circulation models (GCMs), downscaling techniques, and ensemble hypothesis. These scenarios were simulated within the used precipitation-recharge model to estimate impacts on NAR. The results show that global mean NAR decreases by 12% on average over continental Spain. Over 99.8% of the territory, a variable degree of recharge reduction is obtained; the reduction is quite heterogeneously distributed in line with the variety of conditions for aquifer recharge over continental Spain. The standard deviation of annual mean NAR will increase by 8% on average in the future. The dependence of these changes regarding potential explanatory variables, such as elevation and latitude was also analysed. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A framework to derive high-resolution long-term meteorological forcing for hydrologic models from mesoscale atmospheric reanalysis products is presented, including topographic and cloud corrections, and a new physical parameterization of near-surface wind fields. The methodology is applied to downscale 3-hourly North American Regional Reanalysis (NARR) fields originally at 32 km spacing to 1 km and hourly resolution for a seven-year period (2007-2013) over the Integrated Precipitation and Hydrology Experiment 2014 (IPHEx2014) domain with the focus on the Southern Appalachian Mountains (SAM) in the SE US. Evaluation of the adjusted downscaled products was conducted against flux tower observations in the IPHEx domain. At high elevations, the Root Mean Squared Errors (RMSEs) of atmospheric pressure decreased from 44.71 to 2.78 hPa, and the RMSEs of near-surface temperature improved by 1 K (up to 5 K in winter). In addition, RMSEs decreased by as much as 100% for near-surface winds (10 m above ground) at all tower locations and by 25-30 W/m(2) for shortwave radiation at low elevations. Using the uncalibrated Duke Coupled surface-groundwater Hydrology Model (DCHM), the value and utility of the downscaled products for hydrologic offline simulations are demonstrated through comparative analysis of the sensitivity of water and energy budgets in mountain watersheds for four water-years (2007/10-2011/09) including a severe drought and several flood events. Cloud and topographic corrections applied to incoming solar radiation result in hourly net radiation changes ranging from 200 to 500 Wm(-2) at mid-day for clear-sky and cloudy conditions, respectively. Improvements in shortwave radiation and near-surface wind speed estimates have the highest impact on evapotranspiration and soil surface temperature. Wind speed differences of 2-10 m/s translate into basin-averaged differences mid-day surface fluxes up to 300 Wm(-2) and 100 Wm(-2) in the inner SAM, for sensible and latent heat respectively.

AB Assessing impacts of climate change on hydrology involves global scale climate projections by General Circulation Models (GCMs), downscaling of global scale projections to regional scale by statistical methods or regional climate models and then use of regional outputs in hydrological simulations. Hydrological simulations considers varying inputs starting with soil characteristics, land cover, vegetation types, control structures to social parameters such as human interventions, irrigation and water use. This makes the model highly parametrized and at the same time highly uncertain due to the non-availability of majority of input parameters. Here, we compare the contributions of uncertainty from hydrological parameterization in the hydrological projections of climate change to that generated from the use of multiple climate models. The Ganga River Basin in India was selected as the study region. For regional climate change projections, we use dynamic downscaling outputs from Coordinated Regional Climate Downscaling Experiment (CORDEX) and statistical downscaling outputs from a transfer function forced with 3 GCMs, Institut Pierre Simon Laplace (IPSL), European Consortium Earth System Model (EC-EARTH) and MPI (Max Plank Institut) ESM (Earth System Model). Monte-Carlo Simulations (MCS) are performed with 1000 generated sets of sensitive model parameters for each of the GCM-regional model combination. We find that the observed time series of river discharge is reproduced well but with bias in low-flow conditions. This is probably associated with human intervention and poor representation of baseflow in VIC due to the neglected groundwater storage which feed the surface water during low flow condition. The future projections show that the major uncertainty lies across climate models for all the four seasons (MAM, JJAS, ON and DJF) and for all the hydrological variables, soil moisture, evapotranspiration (ET), water yield and river discharge. The uncertainty resulting from the MCS is quite small as compared to the climate model uncertainty. We are unable to find any added value in hydrological simulations by rigorous hydrological calibration and parameterization in absence of many required data, when the forcing meteorological data has huge uncertainty. Our findings highlight the need of convergence of climate models before the studies on hydrological impacts assessment and subsequent development of adaptation strategies.

AB Climate change will lead to great impacts on flood frequency curve and design floods in the future. However, traditional hydrologic approaches often fail to analyze the flood characteristics within a bivariate framework under changing environment. Moreover, previous studies investigating bivariate characteristics of flood usually do not derive the adaptive flood quantiles. This study assesses the implications of climate change for future bivariate quantiles of flood peak and volume in Ganjiang River basin, China. The outputs of two global climate models (BNU-ESM and BCC-CSM1.1) are statistically downscaled by Daily bias correction (DBC) method and used as inputs of the Xinanjiang hydrological model to simulate streamflow during 1966-2099. Projections for future flood (2020-2099) under Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 8.5 scenario are divided into two 40-year horizons (2040s, 2080s) and a comparison is made between these time horizons and the baseline (1966-2005). Univariate flood frequency analysis indicates that there is a considerable increase in the magnitude and frequency of flood under the RCP8.5 scenario, especially for the higher return periods. The bivariate quantile curves under different levels of Joint Return Period (JRP) for historical and future periods are derived by copula functions and the most likely realizations are estimated. It is found that climate change has heavier impacts on the future joint bivariate quantiles for larger return periods. Finally the adaptive isolines and most likely flood quantiles under a JRP are derived from analyzing the merged series by non-stationary copula-based models. The results highlight that the joint probability, illustrated by the isoline of a given JRP, varies significantly over time when non-stationary models are applied. This study incorporates the impacts of climate change on bivariate flood quantiles and develops an adaptive quantile estimation approach, which may provide useful information for the references of flood risk assessment and management under changing environment.

AB Evaluation of surface soil moisture is necessary to understand spatiotemporal soil moisture trends and their implications on water resources management. This research evaluated a real-time instantiation of NASA's Land Information System (LIS) for water resources management applications at a higher spatial and temporal resolution than is currently available with remotely-sensed satellite estimates or in situ measurements of the same product. Managed by NASA's Short-term Prediction Research and Transition (SPoRT) Center, the "SPoRT-LIS" is an observation-driven, real-time simulation of the Noah land surface model at a 3-km resolution over the full continental United States. Surface soil moisture estimates from SPoRT-LIS (0-10 cm layer) were validated against in situ soil moisture from the International Soil Moisture Network in the Missouri and Arkansas-Red-White River Basins. Validation was conducted at in situ measurement depths of 5-cm and 10-cm, and performance was evaluated across varying soil types, land cover, depth, slope, aspect, and pixel heterogeneity to determine conditions under which SPoRT-LIS surface soil moisture had excellent estimation capability. Results demonstrate that 53% of data at a depth of 5-cm and 51% of the data at a depth of 10-cm were significantly correlated with a Spearman's p greater than 0.5 on a daily basis. Based upon validation results, it is evident that the SPoRT-LIS surface soil moisture estimate is satisfactory for research and operational water resources management applications.

AB Monthly streamflow records from a set of gauging stations, selected to form a reference hydrologic network, are analyzed together with precipitation and temperature data to establish whether the streamflows in the Guadalquivir River Basin have experienced changes during the last half of the 20th century that can be attributed to hydrological forcing. The observed seasonal and annual streamflows in the reference network have undergone generalized and significant decreases during the study period. Annual rainfall did not experienced statistically significant changes. The observed trends in streamflows may be attributed to either land-use changes, or to the statistically significant changes exhibited both by yearly potential evapotranspiration values and by the seasonal redistribution of precipitation. In the attribution work conducted using both data-based and simulation-based methods, the intra-annual redistribution of precipitation is shown to be the main statistically significant climate-driver of streamflow change. The contributions of other non-climate factors, such as changes in land cover, to the reduction in annual streamflows are shown to be minor in comparison.

AB Future changes in rainfall patterns induced by climate changes will affect society and ecosystems, and quantifying these changes is of utmost importance for the management of hydroclimate risk. In particular, the estimation of intensity-duration-frequency (IDF) curves for rainfall data is a routine procedure in urban hydrology and hydraulic studies and should be revisited to reflect future changes in rainfall variability. In this work, we propose a novel methodology based on the scaling-invariant property of rainfall duration versus intensity to estimate parameters of a generalized extreme value (GEV) distribution at sub-daily scales. A Bayesian inference framework is developed so that uncertainties are reduced and can be easily propagated to IDF curves. The proposed model can be employed to: (i) improve local (at-site) GEV estimates for sites with limited rainfall records; (ii) estimate GEV parameters at sub-daily scales and construct IDF curves for sites where only daily rainfall records are available (partially gauged sites); (iii) construct regional IDF curves for homogeneous hydrologic regions; and (iv) update local and regional IDF curves from simulations of future daily rainfall. The model is tested using historical rainfall data from 18 gauges located in the Han River Watershed in South Korea, and projected climate change scenarios RCP 6 and RCP 8.5 from the Met Office Hadley Centre HadGEM2-AO model. When considering historical data, the results show that the model satisfactorily estimate IDF curves for both gauged and partially gauged sites. In future scenarios, the model reveals a substantial increase in rainfall events of rare intensity (large return periods), mostly due to changes in the rainfall variability rather than changes in the average rainfall. Particularly, for a 100-year return period event, we expect an increase of about 23% in scenario RCP 6 and about 30% under scenario RCP 8.5 when projected using regional IDF curves. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first statistical approach in the literature to assess future changes in regional IDF curves, which in our opinion is more suitable than evaluating local estimates only.

AB Drainage and deformation of intercalated confining layers due to internal stress change (discharge/recharge cycle) in an aquifer-aquitard system not only can have great effects on the groundwater storage (GWS), but also can cause unsynchronized water level (WL) fluctuations. The phase relationship between GWS and WL is crucial for the accuracy and attribution of GWS changes. We identify the dominating episodic components of GWS and WL through the Singular Spectrum Analysis (SSA) analysis and Harmonic analysis. First, we analyzed a generic aquifer-aquitard system using numerical simulations which showed that the dissipation of overpressure from the aquitard and flow from it is the inherent cause of a phase shift between the GWS and WL observations. Water released from confining layers with compaction time constant of zero (no-delay) to century time scale results in detected phase shift between total GWS and WL in the aquifer. Then, we analyzed the complex and varied phase relationship between GWS derived using the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) data and measured WL time series in the subsiding North China Plain (NCP) aquifer. The spatially varied phase relationship between GWS and measured WL is reasonably related to varied land subsidence development features and may be related with the compaction time constant and thickness of the confining layers. Results of the generic numerical model and the NCP observations suggest that elastic/inelastic response need to be considered in the interpretation and correction of GWS changes for a compacted aquifer-aquitard system.

TI Gravity effect on consolidation in poroelastic soils under saturated and

AB A rigorous mathematical framework is presented for the development of a set of coupled partial differential equations to describe the consolidation of saturated soils under the simultaneous action of external static loads and gravity forces. These equations generalize the Biot model of poroelasticity in a systematic manner to well account for additional momentum exchange arising from the physical mechanisms involved in gravitational compaction due to changes in volumetric fraction and material density of each constituent.
   A boundary-value problem is then formulated as a representative example to quantitatively examine gravity effect on the dissipation of excess pore fluid pressure and settlement magnitude, and is solved numerically in a finite difference scheme. In the current study, the boundary conditions have been directly calculated in numerical scheme, which improves previous studies to avoid using the approximation of the trapezoidal rule. A physically-consistent parameter, derived fundamentally from the first principle, balance of momentum, is proposed for the first time, which provides an exact measure of the degree to which variations in final total settlement occur due to the presence of gravity effect. This dimensionless parameter takes a closed-form expression that refines our foregoing works, and is quite general since it is applicable to both saturated and variably-saturated soils.
   Our studies show that the variations are essentially controlled by soil elasticity modulus and height, as well as a derived gravity factor. This factor underlines the importance of the dependency between consolidation behaviors and distinct physical properties of pore fluids. Lastly, a comparative study is carried out, indicating that gravity forces yield more significant impact on unsaturated soils than saturated soils we examined, leading to more relative increment in the final total settlement.

AB Small reservoirs represent a critical water supply to millions of farmers across semi-arid regions, but their hydrological modelling suffers from data scarcity and highly variable and localised rainfall intensities. Increased availability of satellite imagery provide substantial opportunities but the monitoring of surface water resources is constrained by the small size and rapid flood declines in small reservoirs. To overcome remote sensing and hydrological modelling difficulties, the benefits of combining field data, numerical modelling and satellite observations to monitor small reservoirs were investigated. Building on substantial field data, coupled daily rainfall-runoff and water balance models were developed for 7 small reservoirs (1-10 ha) in semi arid Tunisia over 1999-2014. Surface water observations from MNDWI classifications on 546 Landsat TM, ETM + and OLI sensors were used to update model outputs through an Ensemble (n = 100) Kalman Filter over the 15 year period. The Ensemble Kalman Filter, providing near-real time corrections, reduced runoff errors by modulating incorrectly modelled rainfall events, while compensating for Landsat's limited temporal resolution and correcting classification outliers. Validated against long term hydrometric field data, daily volume root mean square errors (RMSE) decreased by 54% to 31200 m(3) across 7 lakes compared to the initial model forecast. The method reproduced the amplitude and timing of major floods and their decline phases, providing a valuable approach to improve hydrological monitoring (NSE increase from 0.64 up to 0.94) of flood dynamics in small water bodies. In the smallest and data-scarce lakes, higher temporal and spatial resolution time series are essential to improve monitoring accuracy.

AB Knowledge on the water uptake depths of vegetation is crucial for understanding water transport processes of the soil-vegetation atmosphere continuum and relevant for many applications (e.g. the estimation of groundwater recharge, irrigation planning and the parameterization of (eco-) hydrological models). The identification and quantification of water uptake from deep soil layers and groundwater remain challenging. This study uses a combined framework based on natural abundances of stable water isotopes and isotopic labeling experiments with deuterium oxide ((H2O)-H-2) to study root water uptake and identify uptake from deep soil in a semi-arid environment.
   Between 2013 and 2016, more than 1000 soil (isotope depth profiles); plant (xylem and transpiration) and water (precipitation and groundwater) samples for the analysis of isotope ratios were collected. Two experiments using isotopic labeling were carried out in order to assess root water uptake depths. Herein, we i) present series of deep soil water isotope depth profiles, interpret water transport dynamics and ecohydrological feedbacks; di) examine the suitability of natural isotope depth profiles for identifying deep root water uptake; iii) apply the Bayesian mixing model MixSIAR to quantify deep root water uptake and iv) constrain water uptake depths using isotopic labeling experiments and derive an active root water uptake distribution.
   Our results show that the form of isotope depth profiles of soil in water-limited environments follows characteristic shapes for the end of the rainy and dry seasons, respectively. Isotope ratios in the upper 4 m of the soil are heavily dependent on the character of the respective rainy season. Under certain conditions - e.g. droughts or weak rainy seasons - the isotope depth profile displays an enrichment in heavy isotopes up to 4 m depth. Such pronounced anomalies provide an opportunity for studies on source water partitioning. In the present experiment, the studied individuals of Acacia erioloba were found to obtain 37% [24-52%] of their water from deep soil (> 4 m) and groundwater at the end of the dry season of 2015. All other investigated trees (individuals of B. plurijuga, S. luebertii, T. sericea and C. collinum) mainly utilize water originating from 1 m to 2.5 m depth. Under "average" rainy season conditions, the similarity of isotope ratios of potential plant water sources hinders a conclusive identification of water uptake depths.
   Deep natural isotope depth profiles in dry environments can - under certain conditions - be used to identify and quantify access of vegetation to deep water resources. Isotopic labeling enables to determine active root distributions for the lateral root zone. Combined frameworks contribute to a better understanding of deep water uptake. A differentiated consideration of water uptake from the lateral root zone and deep, potentially groundwater-tapping roots is required in order to fully investigate ecohydrological feedbacks and for a proper parameterization of models.

AB In order to obtain an improved soil moisture (SM) dataset at large scale, an advanced SM merging methodology based on error correction methods was constructed to merge the model-based and in-situ observed SM data. The SM datasets in a 0-40 cm soil layer were derived from 10 km x 10 km Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) model and 797 in-situ stations, respectively. The merging methodology was conducted grid by grid, and mainly included two parts: bias correction and random error correction. Firstly, the bias correction was performed for the VIC simulations by applying the Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF) matching approach combined with the kriging technique. Secondly, the random error of the VIC simulations was corrected using an Optimal Interpolation (OI) technique based on a spatio-temporal correlation function which was proposed and constructed in this study. Through validations against in-situ observations, the merged SM was evaluated, and the merging errors in each step were analyzed and discussed. The results showed that the merged SM product was improved compared to the original SM data, both temporally and spatially. The SM merging methodology is effective and reliable in combining the accurate but sparse in-situ observations and the continuous VIC simulations. In addition, the spatial mismatch impact on the representativeness of in-situ stations was limited, and the merging errors were mainly produced in the CDF estimation process. The random error information in the spatial dimension exhibited a bigger impact on the random error correction comparing to that in the temporal dimension. This study provided strong encouragement for the efficient use of in-situ SM observations and provided valuable methods for combining multi-sources SM datasets.

AB Mountainous headwater catchments are safeguards of quality groundwater and hence require special protection against contamination by anthropogenic sources. However, methods currently handling contamination risk fail to produce reliable results in mountainous watersheds because they overlook the influence of downhill flows and contaminant transport in the validation process. To overcome this difficulty, a new model based on so-called "concentration profiles" is presented that combines the DRASTIC framework for evaluation of intrinsic vulnerability, the categorization of land uses for evaluation of specific vulnerability to nitrate and Processing Modflow graphical user interface for simulation of nitrate transport. This model was tested in a mountainous region of Northern Portugal. The risk of groundwater contamination by nitrate was generally classified as moderate. The risky areas are regions used for agriculture and livestock production. These activities have raised nitrate concentrations of spring water (15-25 mg.l(-1)) downstream the risky areas. The Modflow simulations linked the risky areas (contaminant sources) to actual nitrate plumes (contaminant sinks) and modeled nitrate distributions at specific groundwater travel times. Winter plumes could be simulated for the 1-year stress period, and hence are flushable in a short time span. Spring and summer plumes could only be explained by contaminant transport during 10-20 years. In these cases, even if contaminant sources were immediately neutralized, the washout of nitrate would take decades. These results may hold back the fulfillment of sustainable development goals related to water and sanitation until 2030, and hence deserve reflection by water planners and policy makers. The modeling exercise provided extra evidence that safeguarding the catchment headwater is the keystone of groundwater quality protection in mountainous catchments. Therefore, application of this modified DRASTIC to other mountainous areas may not need to resort to Processing Modflow. The study comprises the main paper (this paper) and a MethodsX companion paper.

AB Socioeconomic drought in association with minimum instream flow against the backdrop of local water supply was investigated. An integrated procedure for design combinations of drought properties, such as duration, severity, and peak, involving the truncation of drought events, the goodness-of-fit of joint and marginal distributions of drought properties, the determination of design combinations of these properties for a given Kendall return period, and the evaluation of uncertainty of the combinations, was developed. In multivariate design of socioeconomic droughts in a case study, univariate, bivariate and trivariate design values of drought properties and their alterations due to the regulation of water reservoirs were computed. Results showed that any two properties of drought exhibited a high positive dependence. For a given bivariate return period, the pairs of cumulative frequencies of drought properties formed a symmetric curve for truncated samples and a symmetric curving-belt for large quantities of simulated samples. For a given trivariate return period, the pairs of cumulative frequencies of duration and peak showed a symmetry, but the pairs of duration and severity or severity and peak were remarkably scattered on the side of severity and comparatively concentrated on the side of duration or peak. For the confidence interval of probability of 0.95, the range of trivariate design values was larger than that of bivariate design. The differences between drought design values of univariate, bivariate, and trivariate designs were small, which resulted from high correlations of drought properties, the use of Kendall frequency, and approximate identical cumulative frequencies in design combinations. The decrease of socioeconomic drought properties under the regulation of water reservoirs was significant, but the drought spell, total volume, and monthly maximum of water deficit for a 5-year return period still accounted for 3.06-3.27 months, 0.426-0.470 billion m(3), and 0.211-0.217 billion m(3), respectively, provided that the local water supply was met.

AB Elevated concentration and high variance of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in surface waters are a challenge for the production of drinking water. Past studies have indicated a dominant role of wetlands in DOC mobilization, but have mainly been focused on boreal and oceanic catchments. Here we analyze the observational DOC time series from 89 temperate humid catchments which drain into German drinking water reservoirs. We characterize the DOC concentration median and variability and utilize partial least squares regression in order to quantify the relation to catchment characteristics such as land use, climate, and topography. We found that the long-term median DOC concentration in the catchment is well predicted by the 90th percentile of the distribution of the topographic wetness index (0.9P TWI) over the entire catchment area. The 0.9P TWI can be directly connected to the abundance of riparian wetlands in the catchments. DOC concentration variability (represented as the ratio of the interquartile range and the median concentrations) was also found to be well predictable. Concentration variability was highest in cold and wet catchments with a high 0.9P TWI. Here we also found stronger correlations between DOC concentrations and discharge, with positive concentration-discharge patterns. Catchments with elevated DOC-concentration variance also exhibited the most severe long-term increases in concentrations. Our results thus indicate that, in temperate climates, riparian wetlands can be the dominant source zones of DOC and control the hydrological mobilization and potentially also the spatial difference in long-term concentration trends observed in surface waters. We conclude that the dominance of topography and climatic conditions in controlling spatio-temporal patterns in DOC concentrations leads to very limited management options.

AB Characterizing the hydraulic conductivity distribution in aquifers is fundamental for groundwater models, solute transport and hyporheic exchange. Based on a total of 13,397 borehole packer test data collected at 12 high dam sites in Southwest China, the statistical distribution of hydraulic conductivity of rocks in this deep-incised valley area was investigated using hypothesis test, regression analysis and semi-variogram analysis, showing that the hydraulic conductivity of igneous and metamorphic rocks at various depths in the study area follows a log-normal distribution within 600 m depth. The vertical variation in hydraulic conductivity K [m/s] and standard deviation of lgK with depth d [m] can be best described by the power function K = 2 x 10(-6) d(-0.48) and the logistic function sigma(lgk) = 0.6/[1 + (d/428)(4.7)]. It is deduced that the decreasing degree of weathering and unloading from ground surface to unaltered fresh rocks leads to reduction in the geometric mean of hydraulic conductivity by about 1-2 orders of magnitude. The hydraulic conductivity of rocks in the study area is more controlled by geologic structures of various origins and scales and less by lithology. The compiled data and analysis presented in this study provide a reference for calibration of catchment hydrological models as well as parameterization of surface water-groundwater interactions in mountainous regions.

AB The predictability of droughts in China was investigated using a series of statistical, dynamic and hybrid models. The results indicate that, statistical models exhibit better skill in forecasting the Standardized Precipitation Index in six months (SPI6) than dynamic models. Overall, the ensemble streamflow prediction (ESP) method and wavelet machine learning models outperform other statistical models in forecasting SPI6. The hybrid model can improve the performance of SPI6 forecast by combining statistical and dynamic models using Bayesian model averaging (BMA) method. As for drought onset detection, the 'low probability of detection (POD) low probability of false alarm (POF)' and 'high POD high POF' phenomena exist in statistical and dynamic models, respectively. On average, less than 20% drought onsets can be detected in statistical models while less than 40% in dynamic models, with more than 40% false alarms appearing in statistical models and more than 75% in dynamic models. The hybrid model can slightly balance them, resulting in a POD of 20% and a POF of 50%. In spite of the low predictability, some stations with high equitable threat score (ETS) can be used in early drought warning under certain requirement. These conclusions may help improving drought prediction at a local or national scale.

AB Numerical models of soil-water dynamics have been widely used in the design of soil cover systems for mine site reclamation; however, in most cases these models only consider water dynamics without consideration of heat dynamics. For cover systems in northern climates, such as those associated with oil sands mines in northern Alberta, Canada, freezing conditions exist for approximately 6 months of the year and snow melt comprises approximately 25% of annual precipitation. This study attempts to assess whether a fully coupled water and heat flow model (CM) provides additional insights into cover performance as compared with a water flow model (FM). The CM and FM are developed for a monitored reclamation cover constructed over oil sands shale overburden. The validated results indicated that the key limitation of the CM was its inability to simulate frozen ground infiltration. This limitation results in an overestimate of snow melt runoff and does not replicate the development of perched conditions on the shale overburden surface as a result of snow melt infiltration. The FM is also unable to simulate the observed infiltration of snow melt deep into the cover when snow melt is re-presented simply as surface precipitation in early spring following ground thaw. Both models are improved if snow melt infiltration is represented in the model by the preferential filling of macropores across the full depth of the cover and oxidized shale prior to ground thaw. This methodology is incorporated with the CM to produce a coupled water and heat model with enhanced infiltration (CM-EI), and with the FM to produce a flow model with enhanced infiltration (FM-El). The CM-EI provided an improved simulation of soil temperature dynamics under frozen and unfrozen conditions, as well as soil water dynamics under unfrozen conditions, including the improved representation of the annual water balance components over each water year. Given the small difference in annual water balance components between the CM-EI and FM-EI modelling approaches (similar to 5 mm/year), it is concluded that a FM-EI provides the best tool with which to assess the performance of these reclamation covers.

AB Reference evapotranspiration (ET0) is an important parameter for climatological and hydrological studies, as well as for agricultural water resources management. In this study, 7 temperature-based solar radiation models were adopted to improve the Makkink model for ET0 estimation in Northwest China. The temperature-based models only require air temperature as input data, which can be easily monitored in most areas around the world. The applicability of the improved Makkink models (M1-M7), the original Makkink (MK) model, the Jensen-Haise (JH) model as well as the Irmak (IK) model were evaluated on different time scales using meteorological data obtained from 12 weather stations in Northwest China. The results showed that the 7 improved Makkink (MK1) models (R-2 ranged 0.71-0.86) were more accurate than the 3 physical models (R-2 ranged 0.64-0.76) for daily ET0 estimation at the 4 sub-zones of Northwest China, and the M4, M5, M6 and M7 models were superior to the other models. The M5 model had the best estimation accuracy for daily ET0 on daily scale, followed by M7 and M6, with the R-2 median of 0.83, 0.83 and 0.82, the RMSE median of 0.86, 0.88 and 0.89 mm/d, and the GPI median of 1.03, 0.90 and 0.87, respectively. On monthly scale, the 7 MKi models (with relative error almost less than 20%) were also better than the 3 physical models (with relative error usually more than 20%) at the 4 sub-zones. The M5 model also showed the best performance for monthly average daily ET0 estimation, followed by M7 and M6, with the R 2 median of 1.00, 1.00 and 1.00, the RMSE median of 0.13, 0.16 and 0.19 mm/d, and the GPI median of 0.25, 0.05 and 0.02, respectively. Overall, the estimation accuracy of the Makkink model was much improved by using the temperature-based solar radiation models, and in Northwest China, M5 model which only requires temperature and relative humidity as input data is highly recommended to estimate ET0 on both daily and monthly scales.

AB Climate variability along with increase in the demand for water resources highlights the need for better understanding of the link between regional climate and terrestrial water storage. This paper examined the variation of terrestrial water storage in relation to climatic influences over the Upper Blue Nile (UBN) River Basin from GRACE Terrestrial Water Storage Anomaly (TWSA), satellite altimetry, rainfall, and Multivariate El Nino-Southern Oscillation Index (MEI) anomaly data. Although there is no statistically significant (alpha = 0.05) long-term trend in terrestrial water variation and rainfall in the basin (lake storage, TWSA, and rainfall, p-value = 0.45, 0.48, and 0.55, respectively), in the last decade, two visible droughts occurred between 2002 and 2004, and 2009 and 2010, which resulted in water deficit in the basin, where below average rainfall, TWSA, and lake height (storage) were observed during these periods. Extreme rainfall analysis from Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) and strong connection between wet season rainfall, lake height, and TWSA, respectively, indicate interannual terrestrial water storage dynamics in the UBN Basin is strongly influenced by climate. Further, the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) influences rainfall in the UBN Basin, specifically the peak rainfall season (June-September), which shows negative correlation (r = -0.62) with MEI anomaly values, which indicates that the El Nino case (positive MEI values) is linked to the dry conditions in the basin. The findings of this study, combined with studies such as socioeconomic impact of drought, will facilitate better planning and management of water resources in water stressed regions. Furthermore, this study demonstrates the application of a combination of satellite and other hydrologic data in understanding the hydro-climatic condition of a remote basin.

AB Low impact development (LID) practices are effective in restoring natural hydrological processes, but they may be affected by groundwater and pose additional risk to groundwater dynamics and contamination in shallow groundwater conditions. Their performance in shallow groundwater is not well understood due to monitoring difficulty and the deficiency of modeling tools. The Storm Water Management Model (SWMM) is an urban hydrology-hydraulic model that has been widely used to evaluate the performance of LID practices. However, it cannot accurately simulate the hydrological processes of LID practices in shallow groundwater. This study presents the development, calibration, validation, and testing of a modified SWMM (SWMM-LID-GW) that incorporates groundwater feedbacks into LID simulations. The hydrological performance of LID practices under different environmental conditions was simulated, based on which the impacts of initial groundwater table depth, rainfall type, and in-situ soil type were evaluated, and a number of general nonlinear multivariate formulas were proposed to predict the hydrologic performance of LID practices in shallow groundwater environment and support the feasibility analysis of LID practices before project implementation. The reduction of exfiltration and increase of groundwater drainage in shallow groundwater accounted for a significant proportion of the water budget of LID practices. The influence of shallow groundwater was greater for shallower groundwater tables, in less permeable in-situ soils, and for events of higher intensities and longer durations. However, due to the dominant role of shallow groundwater, the impacts of both rainfall type and in-situ soil type on the hydrological performance of LID practices in shallow groundwater were minimal in general, in contrast to the impacts on deep groundwater tables. The SWMM-LID-GW outperformed the current SWMM for a wide range of groundwater conditions, particularly for locations in which the groundwater table frequently rises to 1.0 m or less below ground.

AB It is widely recognized that the prediction of transport of contaminants in a fractured rock mass requires models that preserve several distinctive features of the inner fracture network, like heterogeneity and directionality; in this respect, Discrete Fracture Networks (DFNs) play a significant role. The solution of the associated equations would claim a high computational demand, that could be met only by using agile and robust numerical techniques. In this note a new numerical technique, fully validated from a mathematical standpoint, is applied to engineering problems, also introducing dispersion models for the description of non-stationary transport phenomena. The method results in a fast and scalable resolution tool, based on a PDE-constrained optimization approach designed to avoid mesh generation problems and allowing for transport simulations with an Eulerian approach. Examples are reported to show the quality of the solution obtained, even by using relatively coarse meshes and quite geometrically complex DFNs.

AB This paper investigates the issues related to the use of validation in hydrological model calibration. Traditionally, models are calibrated and then assessed on an independent period (split-sample) to determine their adequacy in simulating streamflow as compared to observations. In this study, two hydrological models and three North American catchments are used to evaluate the effects of using validation to assess the model parameters' robustness on the model's actual simulation capabilities and accuracy in simulating streamflow. The length of the calibration period is increased from 1 to 16 years, and for each case a large number of randomly selected combinations of years are used for calibration and for validation using the Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency metric. The calibrated model is then run on an independent 8-year test-period to assess the model's actual performance in simulation mode in unknown conditions. The process is bootstrapped 30 times to ensure the robustness of the results. The tests pit the calibration/validation methods on increasing calibration period lengths against a full calibration on the entire available dataset. Results show that the calibration on the full dataset is the optimal strategy as it generates the most robust parameter sets, provides the best model accuracy on an independent testing period and does not require assumption-making on the modeler's part. The calibrated parameter sets for each test-case were evaluated using the relative bias and correlation metrics, which revealed that the method transfers well to these two other metrics. Results also demonstrate the pitfalls of the commonly used split-sampling strategy, where good parameter sets may be discarded due to model performance discrepancies between calibration and validation periods. The conclusions point to the need to use as many years as possible in the calibration step and to entirely disregard the validation aspect under certain conditions.

AB The coastal Chaouia, located on the Moroccan Atlantic coast, comports three aquifers: a first Plio-quaternary constitutes the cover, a second Cretaceous located at SW in the zone of Azemmour-Tnine Chtouka, and a third Primary located at SE in the zone of Tnine Chtouka-Casablanca. These reservoirs constitute the only exploitable water resource for the social and economic development of the region between Azemmour and Casablanca. These aquifers are unconfined, pellicular, and discontinuous. They feed by infiltration of rainwater and discharge at sea. Agricultural irrigation is carried out exclusively from the groundwater, which causes a drop of the piezometric surface and the intrusion of saltwater into the aquifer at the coast. The consequence is the abandonment of some wells contaminated by seawater leading to conflict situations and significant economic losses. Therefore, delineation of the freshwater/saltwater interface is very important in order to build a sustainable groundwater management system and to implement appropriate regulatory policies.
   The purpose of this study is to determine the extent and the geometric characteristics of the saltwater contamination extent in the coastal aquifers of the coastal Chaouia. To achieve this, 399 vertical electric soundings and 48 electrical resistivity tomography profiles were performed perpendicular to the ocean. Furthermore, the electrical conductivity and the piezometry were measured in 344 wells distributed over the study area.
   The study demonstrated the effectiveness of electrical methods for mapping seawater intrusion into coastal aquifers. In fact, the results of the interpretation of the VES and ERTs after calibration with the lithological data of the boreholes, as well as the values of the electrical conductivity, have shown that the length of the saltwater wedge penetration inland depends on the lithological nature of the aquifer formations. Thus, in the zone of Azemmour - Tnine Chtouka, characterized by the presence of Cretaceous terrains, the extension of the saltwater wedge exceeds 2 km towards the continent and its depth reaches 45 m. On the other hand, in the zone of Tnine Chtouka- Casablanca, characterized by the rise of the schists surmounted by the altered schists the seawater intrusion remains limited at 700 m from the coast and at 20 m of depth.

AB Hydraulic redistribution (HR) in sites with shallow soils and its response to random droughts during the summer rainy season in humid areas remains poorly understood. We investigated the soil moisture dynamics, HR and water buffer of shallow soils by monitoring the soil moisture content at multiple depths during a random drought event in the summer rainy season, in typical forestland and orchard in a subtropical area. Soil moisture sensors were installed at depths of 5, 10, 15, 20 and 30 cm at three sites (forest, peach1, and peach2). The total and net daily water use and water buffer capacity of the root zone were defined and calculated. During the short-term drought, the HR of soil moisture occurred at all sites, suggesting that it could be an important process in both forest and orchard land in response to short-term drought. HR occurred at both daily and multiple-day timescales in the shallow soils. The net daily water use had less difference between the sites than the total daily water use. Principal component analysis of the total and net daily water use showed only evident clustering characteristics for the total daily water use, indicating an important plant-soil interaction effect. The depth-averaged magnitude of daily HR varied from 0.385 mm (0.0077 m(3) m(-3)) at the forest site to 0.725 mm (0.0145 m(3) m(-3)) at the peachl site. The redistributed water replenished over 75% of the water depleted from the shallow soil. In particular, soil moisture was better retained in 15-20 cm root zone than in other soil layers. Furthermore, the water buffer capacity of the forest site was not higher than those of the two peach sites (where land use converted from forest), indicating that land use conversion does not necessarily weaken soil water retention. The study results highlighted that HR has a significant influence on water recharge and water retention in humid area, thus benefiting plant drought tolerance and total water utilization. This study provides more insights to evaluate HR's effect on water retention and enhance our understanding of HR in shallow soils during random droughts in the summer rainy season in humid areas.

AB Sediment and nutrient fluxes from agricultural areas to rivers have led to high dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) concentrations that promote algal blooms. Few studies have been conducted to evaluate the effect of sediments on aquatic nitrogen, especially DON, on such blooms. Here, concentrations of dissolved inorganic nitrogen, DON, urea, free amino acids (DFAA), combined amino acids (DCAA), excitation-emission matrices (EEMs) were simultaneously determined in both sediments and the overlying waters from three different waterways and their interactions were analyzed, together with sediment enzyme activities, in the agriculture dominant St. Lucie Watershed. Concentrations of DCAA were generally higher, as compared to DFAA regardless of medium. The sum of urea and amino acids accounted for similar to 20% of water DON. The composition of DCAA and DFAA varied between water and sediment. Degradation index of both DFAA and DCAA was similar between sediment and water, suggesting strong exchange activities between water and sediment. Sediment NH4-N concentration was associated closely with 14 water DFAA. A model, comprised of sediment DON, NH4-N, activities of acid phosphatase (AP) and leucine aminopeptidase (LAP), and two fluorescence compounds, can predict the variations of water NH4 center dot N (55%), NO3-N (77%), DOC (83%), DON (64%), DFAA (> 88%), DCAA (62-96%), and fluorescence indexes (98%). While this model provided an accurate prediction of water nutrient status in the St. Lucie Watershed, it still needs to be verified in situ across larger environmental gradients to incorporate real-world complexity and increase generality.

AB Global satellite-gauge merged precipitation (SGMP) products combine the advantages of satellite precipitation estimates with rain gauge data, providing great potential to hydrological applications. However, the inaccuracies of the precipitation products together with hydrologic model limitations, could cause great uncertainty in streamflow predictions. Therefore, this study investigates the hydrological value of three mainstream global SGMP products, including the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) Multi-satellite Precipitation Analysis (TMPA) 3B42V7 product, the Climate Prediction Center (CPC) MORPHing technique (CMORPH) satellite-gauge merged product (CMORPH BLD), the Global Satellite Mapping of Precipitation (GSMaP) Gauge-calibrated product (GSMaP Gauge). They are used as the precipitation input of the Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) hydrologic model over the Huaihe River basin in China. To better quantify their effects on parameter calibration and streamflow predictions, a newly developed residual error model accompanied with the Bayesian uncertainty analysis are performed. CMORPH satellite-gauge merged precipitation product, recently developed by the China Meteorological Administration (CMA) (CMORPH CMA), is a high-quality regional precipitation product. Thus, this study applies the CMORPH CMA within the same framework to provide a benchmark. The results show that the parameter uncertainty are influenced significantly by the input of various precipitation products. There is a tradeoff between the deterministic streamflow performance and the probabilistic predictive performance for selecting the best input among the three global precipitation products. The streamflow uncertainty intervals of the three global precipitation products are then merged using the Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA) method. The BMA results show satisfying hydrological performance in terms of deterministic streamflow predictions, with the largest Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient of Efficiency (NSCE) values of 0.86 and 0.64, and the smallest absolute relative error (RE) values of 0% and 10.2% in the calibration and validation periods, respectively. In addition, the BMA results also produce much more reliable probabilistic predictions, which even outperform the outcomes of the high-quality CMORPH CMA. Our study demonstrates the potential uncertainty of various SGMP products for model calibration and streamflow predictions. The hydrologic ensemble using multiple global SGMP products provides a promising and advantageous approach to support water management and decision making, especially in ungauged basins.

AB Water flow along or across the interfaces of contrasting materials is ubiquitous in hydrology and how to solve them in macroscopic models derived from volumetric average of the pore-scale processes remains elusive. While the change in the average velocity and pressure at water-sediment interface has been well established for channel flow over porous beds, whether a volumetric average alerts the pressure continuity when water flows across the interface of two porous materials is poorly understood despite its imperative implications in hydrological modelling. The primary purpose of this paper is to provide evidences via pore-scale simulations that volumetrically averaging the pore-scale processes indeed yields a discontinuous pressure when water flows across a material interface. We simulated two columns numerically reconstructed by filling them with stratified media: One is an idealised two-layer system and the other one is a 3D column filled by fine glass beads over coarse glass beads with their pore geometry acquired using x-ray computed tomography. The pore-scale simulation is to mimic the column experiment by driving fluid to flow through the void space under an externally imposed pressure gradient. Once fluid flow reaches steady state, its velocity and pressure in all voxels are sampled and they are then spatially averaged over each section perpendicular to the average flow direction. The results show that the average pressure drops abruptly at the material interface no matter which direction the fluid flows. Compared with the effective permeability estimated from the homogenization methods well established in the literature, the emerged discontinuous pressure at the interface reduces the combined ability of the two strata to conduct water. It is also found that under certain circumstances fluid flow is direction-dependant, moving faster when flowing in the fine-coarse direction than in the coarse-to-fine direction under the same pressure gradient. Although significant efforts are needed to incorporate these findings into practical models, we do elicit the emergence of discontinuous pressure at material interface due to volumetric average as well as its consequent implications in modelling of flow in heterogeneous and stratified media.

AB The 1962 Rubi flood was a severe flash flood, the worst to ever take place in Spain, claiming the lives of more than 800 people following 200 mm of rainfall in 2 h. Such a high number of casualties can be explained by the very high vulnerability of people who lived in the floodplains of a wandering, ephemeral stream (a wadi) prone to flash floods. Many publications to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the flood have been used as proxy data for the event, especially in terms of social aspects. The meteorological and pluviometric information is reviewed, while other information is only found in grey literature. Recently, the event has been considered an outlier in the panorama of European flash floods. Because of the above, this paper aims to convey all the information to readers and show that it deserves to be raised to an international level as an example of an extreme flash flood. After addressing some misunderstandings, it can be concluded that the event was not an outlier, nor was it extreme, in terms of total rainfall, return period, discharge, discharge per unit basin area, unit stream power and flow velocity. It may be extraordinary because the flood reached very high levels by transporting large amounts of both fine and coarse sediment particles. The stream is steep, ephemeral, lacking an armour layer, and prone to torrential events, in which the large sediment transport played a role in how high the flood levels rose. The use of flooding marks to compute discharges is also discussed. In addition, the paper presents a torrential calculation based on the momentum principle in a control volume.

AB After the impoundment of Three Gorges Reservoir, algal blooms frequently occurred in the tributaries of the reservoir, which has posed a great challenge for the local aquatic environment and ecology. To investigate the main causes and key factors of the algal blooms, the Environmental Fluid Dynamics Code (EFDC) model is applied to the simulation of the three-dimensional hydrodynamics and water quality in the Yangtze River and Xiangxi Bay, and the concept of water age is adopted to quantitatively analyze the effects of hydrodynamics on the water quality by linking water age and phytoplankton levels, which has seldom been explored in previous studies. The model results show good agreement with the field data, and the simulation reproduces the thermal stratification and density current in Xiangxi Bay. The results show that Xiangxi Bay exhibits quite complicated hydrodynamic characteristics, and could be divided into different zones according to the transport process. In the upper reach, the water quality is mainly affected by the upstream inflows, while it is mainly affected by the intrusion flow from the mainstream near the river mouth. Water age and water temperature are found to be the key factors influencing the algal blooms in Xiangxi Bay. Besides, a significant positive correlation has been found between the chlorophyll a (chl-a) concentration in the surface layer and the water age of the dominant water source. This conclusion can be adopted to interpret the longitudinal distribution of chl-a concentration and to explain why Xiangxi Bay is susceptible to algal blooms. The correlation between water age and chl-a concentration is further used to evaluate the effectiveness of water level fluctuation in preventing algal blooms. The analyses and findings in this study could help to better understand the complicated hydrodynamic and water quality processes in Xiangxi Bay following the impoundment, and provide insights into ecological and environmental management of Three Gorges Reservoir.

AB Hysteresis is a widely reported phenomenon in natural and engineered systems across different temporal and spatial scales. Its definition is non-unique and rather context-dependent, while systems with hysteretic behavior, including hydrological systems, are commonly referred to as path-dependent systems or systems with memory. Despite widespread existence of hysteretic processes, the current generation of hydrologic models do not directly account for hysteresis. In this paper, we review the fundamentals, theories, and general properties of hysteresis in the broad scientific literature and then focus on its representations in hydrological sciences. Through illustrative examples, we show how an incomplete understanding or representation of the underlying processes in a system can lead to considering the system as being path-dependent. We argue that, in most cases, hysteresis is a manifestation of our dimensionality-reducing approach to process understanding and representation. We further explain that modelling hysteresis in an ideal world requires a full-dimensional process representation, based on a perfect understanding of the processes, their heterogeneity, and their spatio-temporal scale dependency. We discuss, however, that the missing dimensions/physics in a hydrologic model may be compensated to some extent by enabling the model with formal hysteretic components. Moreover, we show that the conventional model structure and parameterization may be designed in a way to partially reproduce a desired hysteretic behavior.

AB We propose a novel analytical approach that provides a simple, integrated tool for assessing the effects of hydroclimatically-driven flow regime variations on fish habitat. Average habitat quality metrics can be predicted effectively by an analytical equation. This is the result of the integration of two functions describing (a) the flow regime (the frequency distribution of discharge) and (b) the relationship between discharge and habitat quality. We applied this approach as a "proof of concept" to a simple model of velocity thresholds for juvenile salmon fry. The flow regime was described by a gamma distribution with physically meaningful parameters derived using a mechanistic-stochastic approach that explicitly links the flow regime to hydro-meteorological conditions and catchment wetness. Under different flow conditions, habitat quality was estimated using hydraulic habitat models. An empirical analytical function was then used to describe the relationship between specific discharge and habitat quality. Six river channel reaches characterized by different bed geometry and morphology were investigated. Four reaches are located in the Girnock burn, a natural upland river in the North of Scotland, while the remaining two reaches are located in the River Lyon in the central Highlands of Scotland that is heavily regulated for hydropower production. Results show that the stochastic model and the analytical function applied, each containing three parameters, successfully described Girnock (in both dry and wet years) and Lyon (naturalised) flow regimes and captured the relationship between available habitat and specific discharge reasonably well. For each site we obtained heat maps linking climatic and landscape features to bi-monthly average available habitat. These maps can provide clear generalised insights into the potential effects of hydroclimatic variations on metrics of fish habitat and have potential for wider applications using more complex habitat model.

AB In recent years, West Africa has witnessed an increasing number of damaging floods that raise the question of a possible intensification of the hydrological hazards in the region. In this study, the evolution of extreme floods is analyzed over the period 1950-2015 for seven tributaries in the Sudano-Guinean part of the Senegal River basin and four data sets in the Sahelian part of the Niger River basin. Non-stationary Generalized Extreme Value (NS-GEV) distributions including twelve models with time-dependent parameters plus a stationary GEV are applied to annual maxima of daily discharge (AMAX) series. An original methodology is proposed for comparing GEV models and selecting the best for use. The stationary GEV is rejected for all stations, demonstrating the significant non-stationarity of extreme discharge values in West Africa over the past six decades. The model of best fit most commonly selected is a double-linear model for the central tendency parameter (mu), with the dispersion parameter (sigma) modeled as either stationary, linear, or a double-linear. Change points in double-linear models are relatively consistent for the Senegal basin, with stations switching from a decreasing streamflow trend to an increasing streamflow trend in the early 1980s. In the Niger basin the trend in mu is generally positive since the 1970s with an increase in slope after the change point, but the change point location is less consistent. The recent increasing trends in extreme discharges are reflected in an especially marked increase in return level magnitudes since the 1980s in the studied Sahelian rivers. The rate of the increase indicated by the study results raises urgent considerations for stakeholders and engineers who are in charge of river basin management and hydraulic works sizing.

AB The Haihe River Basin has become a watershed that suffers from intensive interference from human activities, as landscape patterns and runoff processes have significantly changed in recent decades. Investigating the effect of landscape patterns on surface runoff is helpful for establishing the synergistic evolution relationship between the landscape and the hydrological cycle, providing a theoretical basis and effective way for the future management of water resources. In this study, a landscape metrics approach is used to describe the spatial patterns of landscapes, measure changes in landscape patterns, and relate spatial patterns to surface runoff processes of water resources at a watershed scale. Given that commonly used landscape metrics not considering undulating terrain characteristics, soil properties and landcover conditions, which have significant effects on the surface runoff, a Runoff Landscape Index (RLI) is developed to evaluate the effect of watershed landscape factors on surface runoff. Factors relating to landcover, soil and topography are analyzed, weighed, and integrated during the indicator development. Then, correlation between landscape indicators (RLI and commonly used indicators) and surface runoff is examined. The results show a significant positive correlation between RLI and surface runoff, and the average correlation coefficient is 0.831, much greater than the correlation coefficients for commonly used landscape indices. With potential applications for remote sensing and GIS technology, RLI could be used to efficiently predict annual runoff in ungauged basins even in future land cover scenarios and possibly provide a new perspective for water resource management at the river basin scale.

AB The associations between the seasonal moisture budget (precipitation minus evaporation) and atmospheric and oceanic teleconnections related with dry and wet conditions in the greater Mediterranean Basin are investigated. The driest and wettest Mediterranean winters are selected according to the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI), and the differences in the moisture budget among them and average conditions (i.e. climatology) are investigated. The analysis focuses on the role of major teleconnection indices for the conditions of the driest/wettest winters. According to the results, the Arctic Oscillation (AO) index is the best indicator of variability in the driest/wettest conditions, which are conventionally associated with the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). Large-scale climate variability over the Mediterranean Basin is strongly linked with significant changes of the moisture fluxes in the Gulf of Mexico region and partially in the east coast region of the United States (US), especially for wet years in the Western Mediterranean. The displacement of the prevailing atmospheric centres of action located over the subtropical mid-east Atlantic (Azores high) to the Northwest Atlantic determines the wet conditions over the Western and Eastern Mediterranean Basins, respectively. It is speculated that the relative strengths and positions of these large-scale systems control the Eastern and Western patterns of the Mediterranean climate variability.

AB A steady increase in the consumption of pharmaceuticals and personal-care products worldwide is increasing their occurrence in the biosphere. The current study describes the abundance of 42 selected emerging organic contaminants (EOCs), including human and veterinary antibiotics, UV-filters and analgesics in the groundwater of the urban aquifer of Zaragoza (Spain), which is affected by intensive exploitation of shallow geothermal resources. The presence of groundwater heat pump systems in the aquifer studied offered the opportunity to study the occurrence of EOCs in relation to groundwater temperature and other physicochemical effects derived from this technology. Analysis of the data obtained allowed us to identify statistically significant relationships between the presence of EOCs and temperature, as well as other physicochemical and geochemical properties of groundwater. The results obtained suggest that temperature is a minor factor controlling the degradation of the organic compounds analysed compared to the oxygen input from groundwater heat pump systems which is possibly increasing the aerobic redox conditions, thus preventing the degradation of organic pollutants. Intensive use of shallow geothermal resources therefore seems to contribute in the prevalence of such compounds in the aquifer close to geothermal systems.

AB Accurate estimation of pan evaporation (Ep) is required for many applications, e.g., water resources management, irrigation system design and hydrological modeling. However, the estimation of Ep for a target station can be difficult as a result of partial or complete lack of local meteorological data under many conditions. In this study, daily Ep was estimated from local (target-station) and cross-station data in the Poyang Lake Watershed of China using four empirical models and three tree-based machine learning models, including M5 model tree (M5Tree), random forests (RFs) and gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT). Daily meteorological data during 2001-2010 from 16 weather stations were used to train the models, while the data from 2011 to 2015 were used for testing. Two cross-station applications were considered between each of the 16 stations and the other 15 stations. The results showed that the radiation-based Priestley-Taylor model (on average RMSE = 1.13 mm d(-1), NSE = 0.53, R-2 = 0.57, MBE = 0.21 mm d(-1)) gave the most accurate daily Ep estimates among the four empirical models during testing, while the mass transfer-based Trabert model (on average RMSE = 1.38 mm d(-1), NSE = 0.25, R-2 = 0.46, MBE = 0.65 mm d(-1)) performed worst. The GBDT model outperformed the RFs model, M5Tree model and the empirical models under the same input combinations in terms of prediction accuracy (on average RMSE = 0.86 mm d(-1), NSE = 0.68, R-2 = 0.73, MBE = 0.07 mm d(-1)) and model stability (average percentage increase in testing RMSE = 16.3%). The RMSE values generally increased with the increase in the distance of two cross stations. A distance of less than 100 km between two cross stations is highly recommended for cross-station applications with satisfactory prediction accuracy (median percentage increase in RMSE <5% for cross-station application #1 and <20% for application #2) in the Poyang Lake Watershed of China and maybe elsewhere with similar climates.

AB This study was conducted to evaluate the performance of temperature-based models i.e. temperature-based Penman-Monteith FAO 56 fed with average wind speed (U) value (TPMU) and default U quantity (TPM2), Hargreaves-Samani (HS) and FAO Blaney-Criddle (FBC) against Penman-Monteith FAO 56 (PM) using data recorded in 1993-2015 at 146 sites over Iran. Two statistics i.e. normalized Root Mean Square (nRMSE) and relative Mean Bias Error (rMBE) were calculated to analyze the absolute error and bias magnitude of the temperature-based ET0 estimation, respectively. Except for the December-January-February (DJF), the models gave reliable seasonal estimates (i.e. nRMSE of 30 > %) for the majority of studied areas. At monthly scale, FBC gave poor estimates of ET0 in DJF for more than 60% of semi-arid and sub/humid-humid sites. ET 0 in December and January was not also modeled reliably by TPM2 for 61 and 52% of the semi-arid and sub/humid-humid sites, respectively. Hence, application of FBC and TPM2 appears not to be recommendable in cold areas and months over Iran. Overall, TPMU and HS are better suited at all temporal scales under data limitation over the studied areas. In the case of data availability, calculation of TPM with local average U (instead of default quantity of 2 m s(-1)) is highly likely to improve the estimation accuracy. Seasonal and monthly ET0 were mostly underestimated over the hyper-arid/arid sites during the March-April-May (MAM) and June-July-August (JJA). However, TPM2 and HS overestimated ET degrees for the majority of semi-arid and sub-humid/humid areas. The U anomalies were identified as the primary contributing factor to the error in temperature-based ET0 estimation for most cases. TPM2 , HS and FBC provided more accurate estimates for the U range of 1.5-2.5 m s(-1) . These findings are of significant practical importance for agricultural, hydrological and climatic studies and applications under data sparse condition.

AB Knowledge of the transfer of sediment through river systems is essential for understanding the physical, chemical and biological processes on the Earth's surface. A holistic analysis of long-term records of water discharge, sediment transport, riverbed morphology and estuarine hydrology is here used to quantify spatial and temporal variations in fluvial sediment fluxes along the Changjiang River. We show that the establishment of the Three Gorges Dam (TGD) has directly changed the fluvial sediment-transport process by annually trapping 1.23 x 10(8) t of sediment. The upper Changjiang reach has switched from being the main sediment source before 2003 to a depositional sink of fluvial sediment subsequently. The major lakes, such as Dongting Lake and Poyang Lake, have shifted from being local sediment sinks before 2003 to sediment sources thereafter, such that they now provide sediment to the Changjiang River. Since the 2003 closure of the TGD the riverbed of the middle-lower Changjiang has become the major source of sediment being transmitted downstream, now providing almost 50% of the material entering the estuary. Shoals in the estuarine channels and landward sediment transport from the sea have become major sediment sources for the river estuary. We conclude that dams currently in preparation along the upper Changjiang reach and adjacent lakes may cause the cessation of sediment supply to downstream reaches. Rising sea levels and frequent storms may terminate landward sediment transport, increasing estuarine erosion and inducing seaward sediment transport. It can therefore be expected that substantial erosion could occur in the near future in the Changjiang estuary system.

AB Accurate quantification of large-scale evapotranspiration (ET) has an important scientific and practical significance. In this study, three global high-resolution ET products were intercompared and evaluated across China; the evaluated ET products were the Global Land Evaporation Amsterdam Model (GLEAM) version 3.2, the Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS) version 2.0 Catchment Land Surface Model (CLSM) dataset, and the Numerical Terradynamic Simulation Group (NTSG) dataset. The evaluations were performed at the site scale with eddy covariance (EC) based observations from eight flux stations, and at the basin scale with water balance-based ET estimates from 22 river basins in China. The intercomparison results indicated that the three products consistently presented an increasing trend over a large proportion of China but large differences in the trend of the annual ET and the mean annual ET estimates. The trends of the annual ET estimates derived from the GLEAM, GLDAS, and NTSG products are 0.449, 0.904 and 1.261 mm/yr(2), respectively; the countrywide mean annual ET derived from the three products are 390.2, 443.4 and 419.9 mm/yr, respectively. The site-scale evaluation results indicated that the GLEAM and NTSG products achieved comparable consistencies with the monthly gauge observations and outperformed the GLDAS product; GLEAM was more consistent with the daily gauge observations than GLDAS. At the basin scale, all three products were unable to reasonably reproduce the water balance-based annual ET time series in most basins; the three products systematically overestimated ET in the wet basins compared with the water balance-based ET estimates. The differences in the ET estimates among the ET products may be largely attributed to the discrepancies in the forcing data and model algorithms.

AB Relating stream dynamics to catchment properties is essential to anticipate the influence of changing environmental conditions and to predict flows of ungauged rivers. Although the importance of subsurface processes in catchment hydrology is widely acknowledged, geological characteristics are rarely explicitly included in studies assessing physiographic controls on catchment dynamics. In this investigation of 22 catchments of the Swiss Plateau and Prealpes, we use a simple linear regression approach to analyze the relationship between streamflow indicators and various geological and hydrogeological properties of the bedrock and quaternary deposits, along with meteorological, soil, land use and topographical characteristics. We use long-term discharge percentiles, as well as dimensionless flow duration curves (FDC, standardized by long-term mean discharge) that allow to evaluate the catchment response to climate forcing. While climate conditions dominate the high to medium discharge percentiles (Q5-Q50), the capacity of the catchments to buffer the meteorological forcing can only be attributed to geological characteristics. The sandstone proportion in the catchments explains 54% of the variance of both extremities of the dimensionless FDC (Q5/Qmean and Q95/Qmean) and productive quaternary deposits are responsible of 55% resp. 58% of the variance of the two ratios. Examining the hydrogeological characteristics of both bedrock and quatemary lithologies considerably improves the understanding of catchment dynamics.

AB The relevance of fluvial systems to process nutrients and carbon is widely accepted, but their role as sinks and sources of nutrients and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) is still under discussion especially in non-forested and highly productive streams. In this study, we used a mass balance approach at a reach scale in a Pampean stream to elucidate the major sources of water, nutrients and DOC as well as to determine net in-stream retention efficiencies of nutrients and DOC under different hydrological conditions.
   We measured conductivity, conservative ions (chloride and calcium), soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP), nitrate (NO3), nitrite (NO2), ammonium (NH4) and DOC at the end-point of a reach of Las Flores stream (site A), at two upstream tributaries (B1 and B2), and at each potential hydrological contributors to stream flow (groundwater, overland and subsurface flows, and rainfall). In addition, we monitored one storm event where we collected samples during the rising and the recession limb of the hydrograph.
   Stream flow originated from groundwater (approximate to 50%), upstream tributaries (B1 and B2) at baseflow, whereas overland flow contributed > 20% during high flows. During baseflow, groundwater provided NO3 to stream water, while B2, which received a point input of a dairy industry, was the main source of SRP and NH4. Conversely, SRP and NH 4 were provided by B1, overland flow and subsurface flow during high flows. Overland flow also contributed DOC during high flow periods. Mass balance estimates revealed that the reach acts as a source of DOC, SRP and NO3 (21.4, 37.4 and 53.5% mean net in-stream release, respectively) and a sink of NH 4 (-36.8% mean net in-stream retention). Relevant in-stream processes may be nutrient uptake (as in the case of SRP and NH4) and biotic production (DOC), as well as decomposition (SRP) and nitrification (NH4) in this Pampean stream. Our results stress the relevance of nutrient and DOC generation processes within the channel in non-forested and highly productive streams.

AB Urbanization modifies the hydrologic cycle, resulting in increased runoff rates, volumes, and peak flows in the drainage network. In this paper, the implementation of green roofs as source control solutions for mitigating the impacts of urbanization is analysed at the urban catchment scale. The hydrologic-hydraulic response of a 2 km(2) urban basin is investigated under various implementation scenarios and rainfall characteristics. In particular, a distributed hydrologic model is employed to assess the impact of 4 spatially homogeneous installations of green roofs (25%, 50%, 75%, 100% of roofs area converted) when forced by 6 storms differing in both duration and return period. In addition, a spatially heterogeneous configuration is tested, with green roofs concentrated where the drainage network is more prone to high degrees of filling. Results show that implementing green roofs at the urban watershed scale can be considered a valuable strategy to reduce both flow peak and volume in urban drainage networks, although the approach is more effective for frequent storms of smaller magnitude. In addition, it is found that the urban system may respond non-linearly to the extent of green roofs implementation in terms of peak flow reduction at the network outlet, and that non-linearity is mainly related to the network being close to its flow convey capability. Finally, planning redevelopment efforts on the basis of local insufficiencies in network convey capacity has the potential of increasing the effectiveness of Low Impact Development solutions.

AB The longitudinal functional connectivity of river systems refers to the process-based connections between upstream and downstream areas and is fundamental to understanding the dynamic and nonlinear hydrological behaviour of river basins. However, the quantification of such connectivity remains a challenge due to the absence of a consensus on the appropriate data and methods, especially in delta plains. In this study, based on the difference between water level fluctuations at adjacent stations, a new and quantitative longitudinal functional connectivity index (LFCI) was developed for delta plains. Focusing on the Taihu Plain, we then analysed the spatial-temporal changes in the LFCI during 1960-2012 and investigated the correlations between the LFCI and climate change and human activities. We found that the decadal, annual and seasonal changes in the average LFCI all presented slightly increasing trends in the recent 50 period, but the annual average LFCI increased significantly after 1978; the average LFCIs in June, July, and August of the flood season were less than those in other months in the Taihu Plain. We also found that the spatial-temporal changes in the average LFCI exhibited larger differences at the subregional and station scales; those in the Wu-Cheng-Xi-Yu subregion were least, and the average LFCIs at stations near the borders of adjacent subregions were less than those at other stations. Moreover, we found that the average LFCI had significant correlations with precipitation, river density and water surface ratio. Our results were consistent with common sense facts, which demonstrated that the indicator developed in this study can quite effectively quantify the longitudinal functional connectivity of river systems in delta plains.

AB Groundwater resources are shared across management boundaries. Multiple management units that differ in scale, constraints and objectives may manage a shared resource in a decentralized approach. The interactions among water managers, water users, and the water resource components influence the performance of management strategies and the resilience of community-level water supply and groundwater availability. This research develops an agent-based modeling (ABM) framework to capture the dynamic interactions among household-level consumers and policy makers to simulate water demands. The ABM is coupled with a groundwater model to evaluate effects on the groundwater table. The framework is applied to explore trade-offs between improvements in water supply sustainability for local resources and water table changes at the basin-level. A group of municipalities are simulated as agents who share access to a groundwater aquifer in Verde River Basin, Arizona. The framework provides a holistic approach to incorporate water user, municipal, and basin level objectives in evaluating water reduction strategies for long-term water resilience.

AB Excessive river erosion and sedimentation threatens critical infrastructure, degrades aquatic habitat, and impairs water quality. Tools for predicting the magnitude of erosion, sedimentation, and channel evolution processes are needed for effective mitigation and management. We present a new numerical model that simulates coupled river bed and bank erosion at the watershed scale. The model uses modified versions of Bagnold's sediment transport equation to simulate bed erosion and aggradation, as well as a simplified Bank Stability and Toe Erosion Model (BSTEM) to simulate bank erosion processes. The model is mechanistic and intermediate complexity, accounting for the dominant channel evolution processes while limiting data requirements. We apply the model to a generic test case of channel network response following a disturbance and the results match physical understanding of channel evolution. The model was also tested on two field data sets: below Parker Dam on the lower Colorado River and the North Fork Toutle River (NFTR) which responded dramatically to the 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens. It accurately predicts observed channel incision and bed material coarsening on the Colorado River, as well as observations for the upstream 18 km of the NFTR watershed. The model does not include algorithms for extensive lateral migration and avulsions and therefore did not perform well in the lower NFTR where the channel migrated across a wide valley bottom. REM is parsimonious and useful for simulating network scale channel change in single thread systems responding to disturbance.

The analytical solutions of the fractional derivative models are given and all parameters are determined based on test data. The dependence of fractional derivative models on parameters such as fractional derivative order and threshold hydraulic gradient are analyzed by sensitivity studies. The fractional derivative models provide better description of non-Darcian flow in porous media under the conditions of high and low velocity. Furthermore, the memory effectiveness of fractional calculus is discussed, showing that the fractional derivative order is an indicator of non-Darcian flow in porous media.

AB On the edge of sedimentary basins, burial of geological layers can involve the formation of confined karst aquifers. In some cases, relationships between confined and unconfined karst aquifers can exist and imply an increased difficulty in delineating contributive areas of karst system outlets with accuracy. This work aims to develop a multi-disciplinary approach to highlight groundwater exchanges between multilayered karst aquifers feeding a single spring.
   Toulon Springs, located in western France, provides the opportunity to study relationships between two multilayered karst aquifers. Hydrograph and chemograph analysis coupled with principal component analysis (PCA) are used to evaluate groundwater-flow origins on the northern edge of a sedimentary basin. Natural hydrodynamic responses (baseflow recession analysis, auto-cross correlation function) show an important volume of water located in a saturated zone of the Toulon karst system. Significant contrasts in water quality as a function of the hydrological regime (flood, recession, and baseflow regime) and comparison with shallow and deep water show the participation of a deep aquifer supporting the flow of Toulon Springs.

AB Despite of the fast development of speleothem records, oxygen isotope (delta O-18), the main paleoclimatic proxy, remains complicated in climatic interpretation. Continuous cave monitoring is essential for understanding the response of stalagmite oxygen isotope to East Asian Summer Monsoon moisture transportation. We introduce a 7 years (2010-2016) study on oxygen isotope of atmospheric precipitation, cave drips and modern speleothems at Jiguan Cave, central China, located Chinese north-south divide where is sensitive to Asian Monsoon. The monitoring covered a whole ENSO (El Nino Southern Oscillation) cycle, from El Nino in 2010 to La Nina in 2011 and recovered another El Nino in 2015. The precipitation delta O-18 shows obvious seasonality (negative in summer and positive in winter), but air temperature and rainfall amount are not primary controlling factors. The interannual delta O-18 of precipitation corresponds with ENSO variability, which means delta O-18 value is positive during El Nino event and vice versa. We used HYSPLIT (Hybrid Single Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory) model to simulate the moisture transportation for rainy season in El Nino and La Nina years, and found the Pacific contributed over 50% moisture in El Nino years and the Indian Ocean was the predominant oceanic source in La Nina year. There is no seasonality in drips delta O-18 value, while the response to ENSO variability is evident on interannual scale. The stable negative delta O-18 of drips compared with precipitation indicate there is a threshold for infiltration, suggesting cave drips are recharged by summer heavy precipitation with light delta O-18 value, but it's the mixture of latest and former rainy precipitation that recharge drips in drought, which has been verified by simple infiltration model. We found the modern speleothems were precipitated under nonequilibrium fractionation during drought years, nevertheless, they can record the El Nino related delta O-18 positive anomaly. Overall, the modern speleothems can receive the precipitation delta O-18 signal transferred by drips, and our study offers significance for verification of Asian Summer Monsoon driving force and interpretation of stalagmite delta O-18.

TI Impact of the biotic and abiotic components of low mineralized natural

AB In order to assess the role of the biotic and abiotic components of natural mineral water (NMW) in the spread of allochthonous bacteria in non-thermal spa facilities, we examined the effect of low mineralized NMWs on the growth of several commensal and pathogenic human strains. These NMWs were collected from two Spanish spring spas and had different microbiological characteristics.
   Microorganisms were exposed to untreated, filtered and autoclaved NMWs at the temperatures of 22 degrees C and 37 degrees C for 2 days, mimicking the early stage of starvation. Starvation stress was controlled by the effect identified after incubation in saline. Changes in culturability after exposure were used as a measure of the water's antibacterial effect. The specific biotic and abiotic effect of NMWs on the suppression of bacterial growth was estimated after excluding the bacterial response to starvation stress, characteristic of this natural oligotrophic environment.
   The incubation temperature strongly modulated both the consequences of starvation and the impact of the natural biotic and abiotic components of NMWs on the growth of commensal and pathogenic bacteria. A temperature of 22 degrees C conferred cross-protection of microorganisms to starvation and NMW abiotic stress, whereas a temperature of 37 degrees C decreased the tolerance to both, and had a negative influence on the abundance and diversity of NMWs microflora. This temperature-dependent behaviour of the allochthonous and autochthonous bacteria explained the different culturability of microorganisms after exposure to untreated NMWs at 22 degrees C (approximate to 1-2.4 log colony forming units per ml -CFU/ml- mean reduction) and at 37 degrees C (approximate to 1.8-3.2 log CFU/ml mean reduction).
   Discarding the effect of starvation, we estimated that the antibacterial effect of NMWs at the temperature of 22 degrees C was mainly driven by the microecosystem of NMWs, which explained Z 95% of NMW response. In contrast, at optimal temperatures for the growth of commensal and pathogenic microorganisms, 60% of the antibacterial response of NMWs was associated with the abiotic components of NMWs.
   The biotic and abiotic components of NMWs self-preserve the quality of water, preventing the progression of human pathogenic organisms that can occasionally cause water colonization. The influence of the intrinsic components of NMWs on the suppression of microbial growth is strongly modulated by environmental temperature.

AB Potential impact of climate change on the inland waterway transport of the Mackenzie River Basin (MRB) have been investigated through simulations of the Hydrologiske Byran avdeling for Vattenbalans (HBV) hydrological model, the HBV-light, for the baseline, 1974-2004, and future periods of 2041-2070 and 2071-2100 over the MRB driven by precipitation and air temperature data of Representative Concentration Pathways, RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 climate scenarios of 10 Global Climate Models statistically downscaled by the Pacific Climate Impacts Consortium using the Bias-Correction Spatial Disaggregation. The average onset of spring snowmelt between 2041 and 2100 is projected to occur up to two weeks earlier than the historical (1974-2004) climate. Projected warmer temperature and higher precipitation will lead to higher runoff for MRB in winter and spring, at the expense of decreased summer streamflow and water level at Fort Simpson and Arctic Red River stations partly because projected increase in evapotranspiration will offset the projected increase in precipitation. Under a warmer climate, navigation issues related to low water levels are expected to increase, e.g., under RCP8.5 at Arctic Red River station, the number of days the water level above 5 m is projected to decrease from 74 days in 1974-2000 to 42 days in the 2080s. The summer durations that water levels of MRB will be at or above 3, 4, and 5m are projected to decrease by 2.8%-22.2%, 10.0%-34.5%, and 16.2%-43.4%, respectively, which mean navigation problems would increase because safe transit through MRB depends on its water levels.

AB A calibrated fate and reactive transport model is applied to evaluate alternative water and land best management practices (BMPs) in Colorado's intensively irrigated Arkansas River Valley to attenuate nonpoint source pollution and more closely meet regulatory standards for selenium (Se) and nitrogen (N) in groundwater and streams. Reduced irrigation (RI), lease fallowing (LF), canal sealing to reduce seepage (CS), reduced fertilizer application (RF), and enhanced riparian buffers (ERB) are explored as stand-alone BMPs, and in combination, at basic to more aggressive levels of implementation. The distributed-parameter model, which couples MODFLOW-SFR with RT3D-OTIS, predicts impacts that vary significantly over a region encompassing about 500 km(2) and across time. Results suggest that, over the course of several decades, average Se and nitrate-nitrogen (NO3-N) groundwater concentrations within the region could be lowered by as much as 23% and 40%, respectively, using combined BMPs. Average Se concentration in the river could be decreased by up to 56% with combined BMPs, and NO3-N concentrations by up to 32% by using ERB. The CS-RF-ERB combination type may be the most promising for simultaneously lowering both Se and NO3-N concentrations. To insure compliance with Colorado water rights and the Arkansas River Compact with Kansas, measures must be taken to compensate for altered return flow patterns that will be a consequence of BMP implementation. Results also point to the need to consider the targeting of BMPs to specific locations within the region to maximize their effectiveness and efficiency.

AB Carbon-14 (C-14) has been measured in groundwater for over half a century and remains a widely used tool for understanding groundwater flow systems. Ultimately, the usefulness of C-14 as a groundwater tracer relies on the ability to distinguish between changes in concentration due to various chemical/physical processes (e.g. chemical reactions with solid carbonate material, conditions at the water table), and changes due to ageing along flow paths, the latter being most informative of groundwater flow conditions. To this end, a number of correction methodologies have been developed to account for chemical modifications in groundwater systems. In this paper, we implement two different single sample correction models, one for closed and one for open system carbonate dissolution in conjunction with a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach at two sites; the sedimentary Port Willunga Formation Aquifer in South Australia and a fractured rock aquifer in the Hamersley Basin, northwest Australia. For comparison, we include argon-39 ( 39 Ar) data taken from some of the wells sampled and use a mixing envelope constraint in the MCMC procedure. We found that considering all of the errors associated with 14 C correction resulted in a distribution of values to consider for groundwater dating procedures. When accounting for all parameters associated with single sample correction techniques, the associated error was 10 times greater than the analytical errors. Additionally, inclusion of the Ar-39 data produced mixed results, with little improvement observed in the Port Willunga Aquifer (closed system correction), and a significant improvement observed at the Hamersley site (open system). This is most likely due to the mixing caused by long screens and the sensitivity of the open system correction model. Our results highlight the importance of considering all sources of error in groundwater dating studies.

AB Sustainable water resources management in most river basins needs appropriate techniques to implement the conjunctive use of surface and groundwater resources with consideration of uncertainties. In this study, first a linear fuzzy optimization model was used to find the optimal surface and groundwater withdrawal. Then, by using the results of this model, a Fuzzy Inference System (FIS) was developed to determine the groundwater withdrawal, automatically. The capability of this approach is studied in the Astaneh-Kouchesfahan Plain in north of Iran. To do this, the groundwater of this Plain was simulated using MODFLOW code. Then, two fuzzy optimization methods were developed to minimize the water shortage. Results showed that the average water shortage was equal to 215 and 138 MCM according to current water withdrawal and the best solution for the fuzzy optimization model which was 22.0% and 14.6% of the water demand, respectively. The results of the optimization model were used to predict the optimal water withdrawal of the aquifer using the FIS, considering the predictor variables. These variables were applied to the developed FIS model under different scenarios in order to determine the best scenario with the highest prediction performance for water withdrawal from the aquifer. The evaluation criteria were coefficient of determination, normalized root mean square error, and the mean absolute error which were equal to 0.94, 0.26 MCM and 3.8 MCM, respectively for the best scenarios. These scenarios were able to predict the optimal amount of groundwater withdrawal and can replace the numerical optimization methods.

AB Flow monitoring in Urban Drainage Systems (UDS) is required for a successful system control and operational assessment. Commonly used methods can lead to erroneous results in partially filled pipes and hostile environmental conditions, normally encountered in UDS. Recent studies focused on the flow rate measurements in UDS revealed that the capability of acoustic Doppler velocimeters to estimate mean flow velocity is impeded by several factors. Most prominent issues are the operation under low flow depths and velocities, as well as in the case of the sedimentation at low flow velocities. This study is focused on an alternative method for the velocity measurements in the UDS, based on Electro-Magnetic Velocity (EMV) meters. The study also determines the sensor's capacity to operate when covered by a porous sediment layer, using a newly developed procedure. A brief theoretical background is given to support the idea behind the usage of EMV in UDS. Measurement uncertainties were firstly benchmarked in the laboratory flume without sediment. After local, site-specific (re) calibration, EMV operated with combined uncertainty of only few cm/s. Furthermore, the EMV measured the flow rates with depths low as 4 cm and velocities bellow 5 cm/s. Additionally, a series of tests were performed with sediment layers above the EMV meter, varying in height from 0 to 80 mm. Observational uncertainty analysis showed that EMV meter can be used even in these conditions. Since the bias uncertainty increased with the rise of the sediment depth, a correction function model was derived for the transformation of the output signal, reducing the observational uncertainties below 5 cm/s. Subsequently, practical implications of the EMV usage in the UDS are considered.

AB To capture the temporal variability of parameters of hydrological models, the segmented optimization algorithm (SOA) is usually used which subdivides the calibration period into a number of sub-periods and seeks optimal parameters for each sub-period by optimizing the objective function based on the measured and estimated data in the same sub-period. In this paper, we developed a new method that is called a progressive segmented optimization algorithm (PSOA), which seeks optimal parameters by optimizing the objective function based on both the current and all the prior sub-periods.
   We applied and compared the SOA and PSOA algorithms to the Snowmelt Runoff Model (SRM) in simulating snow-melt streamflow for the Manasi River basin, northwest of China, during snowmelt seasons of 2001-2012. The study showed: (1) PSOA can effectively calibrate the time-variant model parameters while avoiding too much computational time caused by a significant increase of parameter dimensionality. (2) PSOA outperforms SOA for both single-snowmelt-season and multi-snowmelt-season simulations. (3) For single-snowmelt-season simulation, the length of the sub-period has an apparent effect on model performance, the shorter the sub-period is, the better the model performance will be, when the model is calibrated using the PSOA method. (4) For multi-snowmelt-season simulation, an over-short sub-period may cause overfitting problems in some cases such as the situation of taking Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) as the objective function. A compromised length of sub-period and objective function may have to be chosen as a trade-off among evaluation criteria and between the importance of calibration and validation.

The objective of the MPC is to apply a proactive management strategy that uses optimised time-state schedules for operating the actuators of UDS in real time. Aiming to mitigate flooding consequences, the MPC uses EPA-SWMM hydrologic-hydraulic simulation engine and Genetic Algorithm (GA) to optimise the time-state schedules for the actuators of UDS. The efficiency of the MPC was tested on the Lille University Campus, resulting in satisfying improvements in the use of storage capacity of retention elements within the UDS.

AB Mediterranean rivers are affected by natural disturbances and human pressures, which may alter their hydrology, water quality and habitat structure. In this study an analysis of macroinvertebrates community structure has been used to determine how distinct human pressures, such as point and non-point sources of pollution, together with groundwater withdrawal, may affect these ecosystems. A total of 4 sampling campaigns were conducted in the middle reach of the Onyar River (NE Spain), which was affected by agricultural and urban uses. Stream discharge and physicochemical parameters were measured in situ, and water samples and macroinvertebrates assemblages were taken and properly preserved for subsequent analysis and identification. Variation partitioning showed that macroinvertebrate community structure was particularly dependent on hydrochemical characteristics, but also on hydrological variations. In addition, results indicated that groundwater withdrawal altered stream hydrology, and the main reach of the Onyar River became intermittent and even completely dry in downstream positions. This reduction on stream discharge caused changes in habitat characteristics, as well as in the proportion of wastewater. Some wastewater dilution occurred, linked to groundwater with high nitrate concentrations inputs to the stream, and even though the macroinvertebrate community recovered its quality in some sampling campaigns, it presented a different structure than in sampling points not affected by any of these pressures. Therefore, the approach here used to analyze the hydrological effects on macroinvertebrate communities allowed us to determine their influence on hydrochemical and habitat characteristics.

AB Although erosional impacts of rainforest logging are well established, changes in hydrological dynamics have been less explored especially in the post-logging recovery phase following repeat-logging cycles and mature phase of oil palm plantation cycles. This study addresses this gap by comparing hydrological characteristics of five catchments in a steep land area of Sabah, Malaysian Borneo on a gradient of disturbance and recovery - twice-logged forest, 22 years recovery (LF2); multiple-logged forest, 8 years recovery (LF3); mature oil palm, 20 years old (OP); and two primary forests (PF and VJR) as controls. Each catchment was instrumented with water depth (converted to discharge), conductivity, temperature, and turbidity sensors, and a raingauge connected to a solar-powered datalogger recording data at 5-minute intervals from November 2011 to August 2013. Data were analysed via the flow-duration curve (FDC) supplemented by the runoff coefficient (RR) and coefficient of variation in discharge (QVAR) for aggregated characteristics, as well as via a combination of the Dunn's test and multiple-regression at the storm event scale for focused hydrological dynamics. Results show that OP is characterised by a relatively low RR (0.357) but with high responsiveness during storm events and very low baseflow (38.4% of total discharge). Discharge in the LF3 (RR = 0.796) is always the highest while having an intermediate level of responsiveness. LF2 with longer-term recovery shown a reduction in terms of discharge (RR = 0.640). Being the benchmark, the undisturbed forest (PF) has the most buffered storm response with the highest baseflow (67.9% of total discharge). Stormflow and baseflow are anomalously high and low respectively in the near-primary VJR catchment, but this probably reflects the shallow soils and short-stature rainforest associated with its igneous and metamorphic lithology. From a management aspect, although hydrological recovery is more advanced in the 22 years than in the 8-years post-logging catchment, full recovery is yet to be achieved and might be hastened by enrichment planting of the degraded forest. The low baseflow and flashy nature of the mature oil palm have major implications for downstream water supply in ENSO periods and flooding in La Nina periods. Steep lands in the humid tropics are best avoided from any form of landscape disturbance.

AB This paper presents the calibration and evaluation of the Global Flood Awareness System (GloFAS), an operational system that produces ensemble streamflow forecasts and threshold exceedance probabilities for large rivers worldwide. The system generates daily streamflow forecasts using a coupled H-TESSEL land surface scheme and the LISFLOOD model forced by ECMWF IFS meteorological forecasts. The hydrology model currently uses a priori parameter estimates with uniform values globally, which may limit the streamflow forecast skill. Here, the LISFLOOD routing and groundwater model parameters are calibrated with ECMWF reforecasts from 1995 to 2015 as forcing using daily streamflow data from 1287 stations worldwide. The calibration of LISFLOOD parameters is performed using an evolutionary optimization algorithm with the Kling-Gupta Efficiency (KGE) as objective function. The skill improvements are quantified by computing the skill scores as the change in KGE relative to the baseline simulation using a priori parameters. The results show that simulation skill has improved after calibration (KGE skill score > 0.08) for the large majority of stations during the calibration (67% globally and 77% outside of North America) and validation (60% globally and 69% outside of North America) periods compared to the baseline simulation. However, the skill gain was impacted by the bias in the baseline simulation (the lowest skill score was obtained in basins with negative bias) due to the limitation of the model in correcting the negative bias in streamflow. Hence, further skill improvements could be achieved by reducing the bias in the streamflow by improving the precipitation forecasts and the land surface model. The results of this work will have implications on improving the operational GloFAS flood forecasting (www.globalfloods.eu).

AB Associated with Taylor dispersion, in this paper we analyze how the vertical position of a point-source solute release will affect the transport process in laminar open channel flow, through obtaining and applying analytical solution by the two-scale perturbation analysis (Wu and Chen, 2014, J. Fluid Mech., 740, 196-213), which is verified and supported by results from numerical simulations. Based on multi-dimensional spatial concentration distribution of the solute plume, we resort to the previously proposed criterion for identifying the stage of solute transport characterized by the dispersion-dominated (Taylor dispersion) regime, focusing on the relative uniformity of concentration distribution across a given family of curved surfaces (Wu et al., 2016, Sci. Rep., 6, 20556). The most important finding is that for the solute transport transition into the dispersion-dominated regime, the necessary time is about 50% more for the case of solute release at free water surface compared with that at the channel bed, which is substantial under typical physical parameters. Other effects of release position include affecting the displacement of the solute plume centroid, the value of the maximum mean concentration, and non-Gaussian properties regarding the form of the streamwise distribution of the mean concentration.

AB The state-of-the-art genetic programming (GP) method is an evolutionary algorithm for automatic generation of computer programs. In recent decades, GP has been frequently applied on various kind of engineering problems and undergone speedy advancements. A number of studies have demonstrated the advantage of GP to solve many practical problems associated with water resources engineering (WRE). GP has a unique feature of introducing explicit models for nonlinear processes in the WRE, which can provide new insight into the understanding of the process. Considering continuous growth of GP and its importance to both water industry and academia, this paper presents a comprehensive review on the recent progress and applications of GP in the WRE fields. Our review commences with brief explanations on the fundamentals of classic GP and its advanced variants (including multigene GP, linear GP, gene expression programming, and grammar-based GP), which have been proven to be useful and frequently used in the WRE. The representative papers having wide range of applications are clustered in three domains of hydrological, hydraulic, and hydroclimatological studies, and outlined or discussed at each domain. Finally, this paper was concluded with discussions of the optimum selection of GP parameters and likely future research directions in the WRE are suggested.

AB The climate change is an important event that affects hydrological, agricultural and water resources planning variables, and therefore, the hydrologists and meteorologists frequently try to identify trend possibilities especially in rainfall, runoff and temperature time series. For this purpose, the classical Mann-Kendall (MK), Spearman's rho (SR), Sen's slope, and linear regression approaches are applied frequently in the literature. Recently, innovative trend analysis (ITA) provides visual inspection and identification of categorical trends, which is one of the main concerns in this paper. On the basis of ITA methodology, several improvements namely double-ITA (D-ITA) and triple-ITA (T-ITA) procedures are suggested using with simple ITA together. These methods are attractive for the trend stability assessment by comparing partial trend components during different sub-periods of a given record series. Furthermore, partial MK test approach is proposed in this paper for the same purpose. These procedures and approach are applied to a set of annual rainfall records at many stations in different regions of Turkey. As a result, the comparison of the suggested methods based on partial sub-series of the same time series helps to improve trend detection with stability identification.

AB A particle-tracking algorithm was developed to simulate colloid transport subject to wall effects on diffusion as well as colloid surface attachment as described by DLVO kinetics. The effects of spatially variable fracture surface potential, which contributed to spatially variable attachment strength affecting colloid transport, were investigated. The fracture surface potential was assumed to be either positively, neutrally (zero), or negatively correlated with the lognormally distributed local fracture aperture, described with a mean, variance, and isotropic correlation length. The results from several model simulations indicated that wall effects were negligible for the synthetic fractures studied here. When fracture surface potential was negatively correlated with local aperture, colloids were preferentially transported through the fracture, because they tended to enter high-flow, large-aperture regions where they underwent less attachment (have the largest first moment measured upon exit of the first colloid from the fracture). The variance (second moment) increased for flowing colloids when comparing negatively to zero and then positively correlated surface potentials to fracture apertures, because spreading notably increased when suspended colloids were temporarily attached onto fracture surfaces. For colloids attached onto fracture surfaces, both first and second moments decreased from negatively, to neutrally (zero), to positively correlated surface potentials to apertures. This is an intuitive result, consistent with fewer colloids attaching along the larger aperture preferential flow paths.

AB Accurate prediction of the long-term average dimensions of alluvial stable channels is a significant problem in river engineering. The goal of this research is to investigate the effect of flow discharge (Q), mean sediment size (d(50)) and Shields parameter (tau*) on the stable channel dimensions by employing non-linear regression (NLR) and two Artificial Intelligence (AI) methods, including: Generalized Structure of Group Method of Data Handling (GS-GMDH) neural network and Gene Expression Programming (GEP). Discharge, grain size and Shields parameter from 85 gaging stations situated in three stable Iranian rivers were used as input data for the three methods to estimate the water-surface width (W), average flow depth (D) and longitudinal slope (S) of the rivers. Based on the results, it was found that the GS-GMDH produced more accurate results for simulating the channel width with a Mean Absolute Relative Error (MARE) value of 0.055; and GEP produced better estimations for channel depth and slope with MARE values of 0.035 and 0.03, respectively. Furthermore, by employing Artificial Intelligence (AI) methods (GS-GMDH and GEP), the RMSE values decreased by 22%, 25% and 75% in predicting width, depth, and slope, respectively, compared to NLR method. The overall results showed that the AI methods generally produced better estimations than the non-linear regression method. To determine the effect of each input variable (Q, d(50), tau*) on the target variables (W, D, S), a sensitivity analysis comprising various combinations of input variables was conducted. Based on the results, the flow discharge had a dominant role on depth and width estimation of stable channels. In slope estimation, the most important parameter was tau* and then d(50), while the discharge had a weak effect on slope prediction. In general, the Shields parameter was the most effective parameter in depth and specially slope estimation of stable channels.

AB Large-scale in situ soil moisture monitoring networks are becoming increasingly valuable research tools, but existing networks feature almost exclusive deployment of stations in grassland vegetation. These grassland soil moisture observations are unlikely to adequately represent the real soil moisture patterns in landscapes with intermixed land cover types. Here we demonstrate the severity of the problem for one particular landscape and introduce a flexible new method for solving the problem. The specific objectives of this study were (i) to compare root-zone soil moisture dynamics of two dominant vegetation types across Oklahoma, grassland (observed) and winter wheat cropland (simulated); (ii) to relate the soil moisture dynamics of grassland and cropland vegetation using an artificial neural network (ANN) as an observation operator; and (iii) to use the resulting ANN to estimate the soil moisture spatial patterns for a landscape of intermixed grassland and wheat cropland. Rootzone soil moisture was represented by plant available water (PAW) in the top 0.8 m of the soil profile. PAW under grassland was calculated from 18 years of soil moisture observations at 83 stations of the Oklahoma Mesonet, whereas PAW under winter wheat was simulated for the same 83 locations using a calibrated and validated soil water balance model. Then, we trained an ANN to reproduce the simulated PAW under winter wheat using only six inputs: day of the year, latitude and longitude, measured PAW under grassland, and percent sand and clay. The resulting ANN was used, along with grassland soil moisture observations, to estimate the detailed soil moisture pattern for a 9 x 9 km(2) Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) grid cell. The seasonal dynamics of root-zone PAW for grassland and winter wheat were strongly asynchronous, so grassland soil moisture observations rarely reflect cropland soil moisture conditions in the region. The simple ANN approach facilitated efficient and accurate prediction of the simulated PAW under winter wheat, RMSD = 21 mm and normalized RMSD = 0.17, using observed PAW under grassland as an input. This new method for estimating soil moisture under adjacent, contrasting land covers at a relatively low computational cost could be employed for any region and land cover pairing with training data available, and it may significantly enhance the applications of existing large-scale soil moisture monitoring networks.

AB Opencast mining operations frequently lead to the creation of large voids that become anthropogenic lakes when the water table recovers. In the case of sulfide mining the stored water is of an acidic nature with significant concentrations of toxic metals and, therefore, a high pollutant potential. The main goal of the present work is to characterize the hydrological functioning and evolution of four acidic mine pit lakes in the abandoned mines of Tharsis, which is the second most important mine district in the Iberian Pyrite Belt (IPB). We present a simple methodology based on the use of the available orthophotographs and a Digital Terrain Model (DTM) together with the water balance of the pit lakes, which could be applied to other abandoned mining sites, where there is often a lack of hydrogeological information that prevents the application of more complex models. The accumulation of large volumes (5.2 x 10(6) m(3)) of acidic and metal-rich waters in these pit lakes poses a serious environmental concern, with dissolved concentrations up to 2000 mg/L of Fe, 223 mg/L of Al, etc. Sierra Bullones and Fil6n Norte are connected underground and present the same evolution, with water transfers from Sierra Bullones to Filon Norte. The water level in both pit lakes is increasing, with an average rise of 2.8 m/yr since the beginning of flooding. However, the increase in the evaporation rate, as a result of the larger flooded area as the water level rise, would induce a hydrological equilibrium before reaching the overflow level, leading to the formation of a terminal lake. On the other hand, the water level in Fib% Centro and Filon Sur pit lakes remain approximately stable. The first behaves as a flow-through or terminal lake, depending on the annual rainfall, while the second acts permanently as a flow-through lake.

AB We assess the impacts of a range of short-term climate change scenarios (2020-2050) on the hydrology of the Mara River Basin in East Africa using a new high-resolution (0.25 degrees) daily climate dataset. The scenarios combine natural climate variability, as captured by a vector autoregressive (VAR) model, with a range of climate trends calculated from 31 models in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5). The methodology translates these climate scenarios into plausible daily sequences of climate variables utilizing the Agricultural Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications (AgMERRA) dataset. The new dataset (VARAG) has several advantages over traditional general circulation model outputs, such as, the statistical representation of short-term natural climate variability, availability at a daily time scale and high spatial resolution, not requiring additional downscaling, and the use of the AgMERRA data which is bias-corrected extensively. To assess the associated impacts on basin hydrology, the semi-distributed Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) land-surface model is forced with the climate scenarios, after being calibrated for the study area using the fine-resolution (0.05 degrees) merged satellite and in-situ observation-based dataset, Climate Hazards Group InfraRed Precipitation with Station data (CHIRPS). The climate data are further bias-corrected by applying a non-parametric quantile mapping scheme, where the cumulative distribution functions are approximated using kernel densities. Three different wetness scenarios (dry, average, and wet) are analyzed to see the potential shortterm changes in the basin. We find that the precipitation bias correction is more in effect in the mountainous subbasins, one of which also shows the maximum difference between the wet and dry scenario streamflows. Precipitation, evapotranspiration, and soil moisture show increasing trends mostly during the primary rainy season, while no trend is found in the corresponding streamflows. The annual values of these variables also do not change much in the coming three decades. The methodology implemented in this study provides a reliable range of possibilities which can greatly benefit risk analysis and infrastructure designing, and shows potential to be applied to other basins.

AB A major challenge in predicting the response of both social-hydrological and social-ecological systems to environmental change is the lack of a causal framework for predicting thresholds of change between the linked social and natural components. Here we propose a social-ecohydrological thresholds (SEHT) framework that integrates social-hydrological, trait-based ecological, and ecosystem services concepts. This approach facilitates the identification of thresholds by treating ecosystem services as indicators of the coupling of social and natural components of the system. Using the San Pedro riparian corridor in Arizona as a case study, we implemented the SEHT framework using ecological research and stakeholder perspectives to identify key drivers and thresholds in the social-ecohydrological system. In this way, we were able to describe expected outcomes of different hydrological change scenarios on the system. Stakeholders provided input on the utility of this information to inform management decisions aimed at mitigating the impacts of environmental change. The SEHT framework provides insight on dynamics of ecosystem services. This paper demonstrates that application of the framework enables the identification of several critical drivers of potential thresholds in ecosystem services that derive from either natural or social components of the overall system. These potential thresholds can guide ecosystem service assessment and monitoring and provide a roadmap for environmental management and the development of management scenarios.

AB Emitter discharge is one of the most important parameters considered in the design, operation, and management of subsurface irrigation systems. The emitter discharge, if properly chosen, can eliminate surface runoff and minimize deep percolation water losses. The discharge from a ceramic emitter depends on the working pressure head and the ceramic hydraulic conductivity, so it is important to determine the optimal working levels for these two design parameters. In this work, it is confirmed that the HYDRUS-2D predictions of the cumulative infiltration and the horizontal wetting front are in good agreement with experimental results, and that the Hydrus-2D model can be used to accurately simulate soil water movement under subsurface irrigation with ceramic emitters. Additional simulations with HYDRUS-2D were used to study the effects of various design parameters (i.e. working pressure head and ceramic hydraulic conductivity) on emitter discharges in soils, deep percolation and soil wetting fronts. Results show that both the working pressure head and ceramic hydraulic conductivity have significant impact on the discharge of emitters in soil, and the deep percolation water losses. The emitter discharge in soil decreases with time and finally stabilizes. When the working pressure head and ceramic hydraulic conductivity are higher, the stable discharge (emitter discharge in soil at 120 h) is greater, and this situation may increase the risk of deep percolation. The relationship between the working pressure head, ceramic hydraulic conductivity, and stable discharge is developed as a power function. To satisfy the water requirements of trees with an active layer of root systems down to about 0-100 cm in the Loess Plateau in China and reduce the risk of deep percolation, it is recommended that the working pressure head should be 20-50 cm of water and the ceramic hydraulic conductivity should be between 0.1 and 1.9 cm h(-1).

AB Water withdrawn from lakes is one of pathways to support economic development in China. Yet lake water withdrawals, especially through unauthorized behaviors, have not been accurately quantified. Here we proposed a coupled simulation-optimization model to determine the unauthorized water withdrawals from Lake Dianchi (the sixth largest freshwater lake in China) and assessed their impacts on lake hydrology. Together the results of systematic observations, on-site surveys, and local statistics reveal that lake water withdrawals played a non negligible role in lake water budget, accounting for 19.6% of total outputs from the lake over the period 1999-2011. Most water withdrawal events occurred from April to October when toxic blooms of cyanobacteria happened. Lake water withdrawals reshuffled water budget components of the lake itself, leading to a substantial decrease in lake outflows and water levels and an increase of highly-polluted return flows, which might further intensify local lake eutrophication and downstream water scarcity. In the light of the importance for sustainable water management, we suggest that a new and expanding monitoring network across China's lakes to understand the process of lake water withdrawals would be beneficial to meet water demands without compromising lake ecosystems.

AB Understanding the metal dynamics in natural waters is critical to assessing the process and flow pathways that deliver these constituents to the stream network. Metal dynamics can be addressed by an analysis of concentration-discharge relationship across a large spectrum of hydrological conditions. However, metal-discharge responses have only been studied in detail for short periods or a few selected events. In this study, a detailed analysis of the hysteresis loops exhibited by metal concentration-discharge relationship was undertaken to assess the Al, Fe, Mn and Cu dynamics and factors controlling changes in metal concentrations in a small scale rural catchment. Metal (sediment-associated and dissolved) concentrations were measured at high temporal resolution during storm events in a small rural headwater catchment in Galicia (NW Spain). Hysteresis analysis indicated a contrasting concentration-discharge dynamic for sediment-associated and dissolved metals, highlighting a strong decoupling between the two due to their different sources or delivery pathways. For sediment associated metals, clockwise hysteresis (56%) was the predominant pattern, highlighting the rapid sediment associated metal mobilisation via surface runoff from sources located near the stream channel. In contrast, dissolved metal showed predominantly anticlockwise hysteresis (58% of storm events), emphasising the role of subsurface flow and soil leaching processes. The different flushing mechanisms between sediment-associated and dissolved metals imply that different catchment management strategies should be implemented for the control of metal export.

AB Water-oriented forest management is an urgent need in semiarid catchments. In the case of low-biomass forests and shrublands, the magnitude, efficiency and temporal duration of thinning effects on rainfall partitioning needs further attention. This work studies the effects of juvenile thinning and shrub clearing on stemflow (Stf), throughfall (Thr) and interception (It) in two low-biomass forests (CAL: post-fire Aleppo pine saplings with 74% of basal area, BA, removed; and HU: evergreen oak coppice with 41% of BA removed), as well as the relative contribution of the event meteorology. The effects are compared with a control plot during the first 3-4 years. Stf rate (%) decreased with density and, on a tree scale, it was enhanced by the treatment only in the bigger oaks. Event Thr increased from 55 to 81% and from 68 to 86% of gross rainfall (Pg) for CAL and HU respectively after thinning, resulting in about 15% less intercepted Pg. High evaporative conditions and an open (ventilated) forest structure led to high It rates in the controls when comparing with other studies, thus making the treatments more efficient in net precipitation (Pn) gain (Pg intercepted decreased 17% or 2.3% per unit of LAI or BA removed respectively). In general, depths (mm) were mostly explained (> 75%) by the rainfall characteristics of the event (e.g. amount, duration, intensity), with a limited contribution from forest structure (e.g. cover, LAI) and event meteorology (e.g. temperature, wind speed, vapor pressure deficit). On the contrary, when expressed as rates (% of Pg), forest structure and event-meteorology gained importance (explaining 25-65%), especially in the drier site (CAL). In this site, the low gain in Pn (similar to 25 mm per year on average) was offset with no temporal dampening during the span of this study, as observed in the wetter site (HU), where plant growth tended to mitigate the effect of the treatment by the end of the study. The results presented here make a contribution to a better understanding of the effects of water-oriented forest management in low-biomass semiarid forests.

AB The frequency and intensity of drought could be increasing with global warming. When drought occurs, the runoff generation process and the precipitation-runoff relationship might change. In this study, the precipitation runoff relationship in drought years was systematically investigated in the largest freshwater lake basin of China, namely, the Poyang Lake Basin. The results showed that the precipitation-runoff relationship changed significantly (p < 0.05) in drought years. The annual runoff coefficient in drought years decreased by 24.1% compared with that in non-drought years. The decreased magnitude of runoff coefficient had a significant positive relationship (p < 0.01) with the drought severity, i.e., the standardized precipitation index of the year. Two hydrological models calibrated by the objective function Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency significantly overestimated runoff in drought years. Three additional objective functions that are sensitive to low flow simulations significantly improved the accuracy of runoff simulation in drought years. Therefore, we recommend that the selected objective functions for runoff simulation in drought years should be sensitive to low flow simulations. Otherwise, the water resources availability will be overestimated in drought years.

AB Understanding the combined and separate effects of climate and land use change on the water cycle is necessary to mitigate negative impacts. However, existing methodologies typically divide data into discrete (before and after) periods, implicitly representing climate and land use as step changes when in reality these changes are often gradual. Here, we introduce a new regression-based methodological framework designed to separate climate and land use effects on any hydrological flux of interest continuously through time, and estimate uncertainty in the contribution of these two drivers. We present two applications in the Yahara River Watershed (Wisconsin, USA) demonstrating how our approach can be used to understand synergistic or antagonistic relationships between land use and climate in either the past or the future: (1) historical streamflow, baseflow, and quickflow in an urbanizing subwatershed; and (2) simulated future evapotranspiration, drainage, and direct runoff from a suite of contrasting climate and land use scenarios for the entire watershed. In the historical analysis, we show that 60% of recent streamflow changes can be attributed to climate, with approximately equal contributions from quickflow and baseflow. However, our continuous method reveals that baseflow is significantly increasing through time, primarily due to land use change and potentially influenced by long-term increases in groundwater storage. In the simulation of future changes, we show that all components of the future water balance will respond more strongly to changes in climate than land use, with the largest potential land use effects on drainage. These results indicate that diverse land use change trajectories may counteract each other while the effects of climate are more homogeneous at watershed scales. Therefore, management opportunities to counteract climate change effects will likely be more effective at smaller spatial scales, where land use trajectories are unidirectional.

AB While remotely-sensed data reveal enhanced vegetation growth under a warming climate, how such vegetation dynamics could alter regional hydrology is not fully understood. In this study, we investigated how changes in leaf area index (LAI) and climatic variability alter long-term trends and seasonal variability of evapotranspiration (ET), runoff (R), and soil moisture (SM) over the conterminous United States (CONUS) during the period 1983-2009 by using the Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) model with transient remotely-sensed LAI inputs. Factor-controlled simulation experiments reveal that while precipitation is the dominant factor controlling long-term trends and inter-annual fluctuations of water fluxes, other factors (temperature, LAI, and atmospheric CO2) make significant contributions to long-term trends, particularly over specific regions. Changes in LAI result in minor overall contributions to the inter -annual variability of ET, R, and SM over the CONUS as a whole; however, they do make a more significant contribution over certain regions, such as the Midwest. Furthermore, changing LAI is the second most important factor in controlling variability in ET and SM, particularly over the cool season. Anomalies of LAI during El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) phases result in no significant correlations with anomalies in R and SM, but result in positive correlations with ET, indicating that vegetation dynamics can have a significant impact on the hydrologic cycle over continental scales.

AB Changing climate, especially extreme weather event, is exerting considerable impacts on the hydrological and biogeochemical processes in forests worldwide. A deep understanding of climate change terrestrial feedbacks is essential to predict future regional/global carbon and water budgets, which can be used to develop potential strategies for forest management. In this study, totally 11 years of eddy covariance tower measurements of CO2 and H2O fluxes, as well as the relevant environmental variables were analyzed to reveal the effects of climate anomalies on vegetation phenology, carbon sequestration and ecosystem water-use efficiency (WUE) dynamics in a humid temperate deciduous forest. Warmer spring temperatures altered the phenological phases with the green-up date advanced approximately 3.5 days per degrees C, and the extended growing season of about 3 days per degrees C, reaching the peak in 2012. Because of spring temperature anomaly, the shift from carbon source to sink occurred nearly 40 days earlier than usual. But the abnormal carbon dynamics happened during the peak growth period. Correlation analyses indicated that the amount of precipitation dominantly controlled the capacity of forest carbon sequestration (NEP) in this area. Therefore, the subsequent water scarcity owing to the extremely dry summer together with heatwave severely decreased the forest NEP by about 64.1%. Further analyses implied that the sharp reduction in gross primary production (GPP) rather than ecosystem respiration (Re) resulted to the decrease in NEP. Both GPP and evatranspiration (ET) were larger during the springtime in 2012 than those at adjacent years. But severe summer drought reduced the ecosystem WUE and yielded the lowest GPP and ET. Further work must focus on improving the recognition of forest feedback to climate systems.

AB Flood modelling in data-sparse regions have been always limited to empirical, statistical or geomorphic approaches that are suitable to produce regional hazard maps. Such coarse resolution maps are not adapted for basin-scale applications, small to medium sized basins (< 1000 km(2)), especially when detailed estimates of flows and water levels of a particular event is required and hence cannot replace the hydrological/hydraulic modelling. The latter is a challenging task in data-sparse regions characterized by floods of typical duration times of a few hours which offer little opportunity for real-time recording by traditional rain-gauge networks, remote sensing or satellite imaging. Such data sparseness is not always compatible with the resolution, in both space and time, of the hydrological and hydraulic models. We propose a framework for flood modelling using sparse data from a coupled hydrological-hydraulic model constrained by past storm events and post-event measurements in space. The approach is applied to the Awali river basin (301 km(2)), in Lebanon, particularly to simulate the investigated early January 2013 extreme flood event, which is considered one of the largest events in the last three decades. The hydrological model was calibrated and evaluated with 12 past storm events aiming at defining narrow parameter ranges and uncertainty was performed with Monte Carlo simulations for these parameter ranges. The hydraulic model, based on a fine resolution DEM, was simulated using hydrological outflows and validated with 27 post-event measurements in space of high water marks. The resulting outflow values were satisfactory, and uncertainty was reduced when compared with arbitrarily wide parameter ranges. The hydrological model performance was highly variable but for the hydraulic model, 93% of the observed water levels fall within the simulated uncertainty bounds with an RMSE error of 0.26 m. The proposed framework allows mapping the possible inundation and can be compared to other approaches dealing with model complexity and associated performances.

AB Understanding the velocity distribution of shallow water flow along hill-slope is of great significance in soil erosion studies. This study proposes a method to estimate the steady flow velocity and the distance when water flow reaches stability, using hill-slope flow velocity distribution data along a simulated rill measured by the electrolyte tracer pulse method. Laboratory experiments were performed using a flume of 12 m long, 0.1 m wide and 0.3 m height under five slope gradients (5, 10, 15, 20 and 25) and four flow discharges (2, 4, 8 and 16 L min(-1)). The electrolyte tracer pulse method was employed to measure the flow velocities at locations of 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10 and 12 m from the inlet of the flowing water. The flow velocities measured by the dye tracer method served as a control. The results showed that the flow velocities measured by the electrolyte tracer pulse method initially accelerated and then reached a steady value. An equation for estimating flow velocity on the basis of the measurement distance was established. The flow velocities calculated by the equation agreed well with those measured by the electrolyte tracer pulse method. The determination (R-2) and the Nash-Sutcliffe model efficiency (NSE) were greater than 0.800, except for a few cases. In addition, the equation established in this study was shown to successfully predict flow velocities measured in other studies. The steady flow velocities and the distances when water flow reached stability under different slope gradients and flow discharges were determined by this equation. When the differences between the measured flow velocity and the steady flow velocity were very small, that is, 5% and 10%, the steady distances ranged from 2.239 m to 4.772 m and from 2.843 m to 6.059 m, respectively. By comparing the steady flow velocities with the flow velocities measured by the dye tracer method, the results indicated that the steady flow velocities were 0.702-0.735 times that of the flow velocities measured by the dye tracer method at various slope gradients and flow discharges. A linear function existed between the two, and the regressed parameter k (i.e., 0.718) could be used as the correction factor between the two. In general, the equation established in this study can facilitate the prediction of the steady flow velocity.

AB Predicting the evolution of concentration distribution of environmental transport in wetland flows has a broad range of applications in ecological engineering practice. By extending a previous study, the spatial concentration distribution of solute transport due to an instantaneous environmental emission in a wetland channel with rectangular cross-section is presented in this work by means of Chatwin's long-time asymptotic technique. To account for the effect of high order moment, skewness of the transverse mean concentration distribution is analyzed. Two important parameters, i.e., aspect ratio (depth to width) and damping factor, on the dispersion process are discussed. Four studied cases illustrated that the transverse concentration distribution is nonuniform even at large time and the aspect ratio can affect the transverse concentration distribution greatly. The cross-sectional mean concentration distribution is asymmetrical in the initial stage and shows an asymptotic Gaussian distribution at large time. The dispersion process in a thick (width equals depth) wetland channel is quicker than that in a thin wetland channel. The spatial concentration distribution is dominated by the lateral-sidewall-effect on a large time scale for environmental transport in a thin wetland channel.

AB Sustainable water resources management in arid and semi-arid areas needs robust models, which allow accurate and reliable predictive modeling. This issue has motivated the researchers to develop hybrid models that offer solutions on modelling problems and accurate predictions of groundwater potential zonation. For this purpose, this research aims to investigate the capability and robustness of a novel hybrid model, namely the logistic model tree (LMT) and compares it with state-of-the-art models such as the support vector machine and C4.5 models that locate potential zones for groundwater springs. A spring location dataset consisting of 359 springs was provided by field surveys and national reports and from which three different sample data sets (S1-S3) were randomly prepared (70% for training and 30% for validation). Additionally, 16 spring-related factors were analyzed using regression logistic analysis to find which factors play a significant role in spring occurrence. Twelve significant geo-environmental and morphometric factors were identified and applied in all models. The accuracy of models was evaluated by three different threshold-dependent and -Independent methods including efficiency (E), true skill statistic (TSS), and area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC-ROC) methods. Results showed that the LMT model had the highest accuracy performance for all three validation datasets (E-mean = 0.860, TSSmean = 0.718, AUC-ROCmean = 0.904); although a slight sensitivity to change in input data was sometimes observed for this model. Furthermore, the findings showed that relative slope position (RSP) was the most important factor followed by distance from faults and lithology.

AB The permeability of deep-seated reservoirs and aquifers usually changes with formation pressure; however, the widely used analytical method assumes constant permeability, resulting in significant errors in flow rate prediction. This work extended the conventional analytical method to consider the effect of stress-sensitive permeability. The proposed analytical method was validated by comparing analytical flow-rate solutions for vertical wells with numerical flow-rate solutions. The production rates of a multi-stage fractured horizontal (MSFH) well with and without the effect of stress-sensitive permeability were obtained. A field case of an MSFH well was used to test the applicability of the proposed analytical method. It was found that the stress-sensitive effect negatively affected production rates of the MSFH well for the whole flow period, increasing with increasing drawdown pressure and permeability modulus. The proposed method is appropriate for various well types and reservoir scenarios. Compared with the conventional method, the proposed method can be employed to obtain more accurate production rates with little increase in the computational time.

AB The Cevennes-Vivarais (France) is a region prone to heavy precipitation events and flash floods occurring mainly during the autumn season. Due to this vulnerability, it is a well instrumented region to monitor rainfall (4 weather radars of the French ARAMIS radar network, 200 hourly raingauges) and river discharge (45 stations). A multiscale radar-raingauge rainfall re-analysis from 10 to 300 km(2) and 1 h time step has been established for the period 2007-2014 by using the kriging with external drift (KED) technique. In the present work, a quantification of the isolated and joint impacts of precipitation and model uncertainties in distributed rainfall-runoff simulations is presented for 10 km(2)-1 h model resolution. For this purpose the following methodology is implemented: (1) Development of a distributed hydrological model based on the Curve Number and the Unit Hydrograph concepts for the Ardeche and Gardon catchments; (2) Generation of an ensemble of perturbed precipitation fields based on the KED error standard deviations and the space-time structure of the residuals to the drift. (3) Generation of so-called behavioral parameter sets for the hydrological model based on generalized sensitive analysis (GSA) and the use of discharge observations; (4) Implementation of the hydrological model for gauged and ungauged catchments with the radar-raingauge rainfall ensembles and the various parameter sets. Uncertainties in rainfall and runoff simulations are then quantified in terms of coefficient of variation. The main findings reveal that (i) the precipitation uncertainty is dampened in the hydrological simulation, especially as long as the size of the watershed increases; in the considered context, the model uncertainty dominates the precipitation uncertainty and it is shown to be independent on catchment size.

AB Whether the spatial variation and influence of rock fragment contents (RFCs) on soil hydraulic parameters (SHPs) should be jointly considered in the soil water simulation have been less investigated in previous studies. In this study, we tested whether considering these factors were necessary in the soil water simulation on a representative stony-soil hillslope located in Taihu Lake Basin, China. Five schemes of SHPs in HYDRUS-3D model were established. They were (i) MultiRFHet: spatially varied SHPs extracted from Dumer's multimodal retention function based on the observed soil water retention data; (ii) RosHom: spatially uniformed SHPs derived from ROSETTA; (iii) RosHet: spatially varied SHPs derived from ROSETTA; (iv) RosFtFCHom: spatially uniformed SHPs derived from ROSETTA and adjusted by RFCs; (v) RosRFCHet: spatially varied SHPs derived from ROSETTA and adjusted by RFCs. Results indicated when the spatial variation and influence of RFCs on SHPs were both considered (MultiRFHet and RosRFCHet), acceptable accuracies (Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency or NSE 0.58 for MultiRFHet and > 0.17 for RosRFCHet) were achieved in simulating the soil water storage (SWS) variation. Since the MultiRFHet required the calibration by the observed soil water retention data, RosRFCHet was a good alternative in the simulation. On the contrary, the SHPs acquired without considering neither the RFCs nor the spatial variation yielded unacceptable simulation results (NSE general < 0). This demonstrated that spatial variation and influence of RFCs on SHPs should be included in the SWS simulation on this stony-soil hillslope, although it had limited effect in subsurface flow simulation.

AB Studying the spatial and temporal variations of stable hydrogen and oxygen isotopic values (delta D and delta O-18, respectively) in precipitation and groundwater in catchments with different land cover is of great significance to understanding the hydrologic cycles within the catchments. This study is focused on three karst catchments, Banzhai, Chenqi and Dengzhanhe, in Guizhou Province, Southwest China, a region with a subtropical humid monsoon climate. We analyzed the spatial and temporal variations in the SD and delta O-18 of precipitation and groundwater in these areas from September 2007 to September 2009. Local meteoric water lines (LMWLs) for the study areas and their relationships with groundwater were established. The seasonal variations of 8121 and delta O-18 for both precipitation and groundwater were similar, being depleted in the heavier isotopomer in the rainy season and enriched in the heavier isotopomer in the dry season. The similarity of patterns between groundwater and precipitation indicates short groundwater residence times in the three catchments, typical of karst terrains. The isotopic values of the Banzhai catchment, which is covered by a thin soil layer beneath virgin forest floor, had the largest variation among the three catchments. The isotopic compositions of the Banzhai catchment groundwater were close to those of precipitation in the rainy season and responded rapidly to it, indicating that precipitation quickly recharges groundwater in this area. In comparison, in the Chenqi and Dengzhanhe catchments, the thicker soil layers and large numbers of paddy fields and dry lands in the catchments resulted in more intense evaporation, and therefore relatively higher isotopic values in the infiltration water. Consequently, the isotopic values of spring water in these two areas were higher and varied to a lesser extent in the rainy season than those of precipitation. The Rayleigh fractionation model based on the correlation between the deuterium excess (d) and evaporation was employed in this study. The model calculation results showed that the catchment evaporation was more intense in Dengzhanhe than in Chenqi, with 14 +/- 1% and 6 +/- 4% of the water evaporated in Dengzhanhe and Chenqi, respectively. The higher percentage of evaporation in Dengzhanhe was mainly due to the larger percentage of paddy fields in the catchment. In contrast, the effects of evaporation from free water surfaces or soil surfaces on groundwater in the virgin forest-covered Banzhai catchment were extremely weak. Based on the isotopic and high-resolution continuous meteorological and discharge data, the transpiration rates were estimated to be 78% for Banzhai, 10 +/- 4% for Chenqi, and 24 +/- 1% for Dengzhanhe, and the differences among these values are mainly attributed to differences in vegetation types in those areas. These results show that the variation in stable isotopes in groundwater can be used as a key index in evaluating the effects of different land cover changes and environmental changes on the water cycle in a catchment.

AB Economic losses caused by flash floods are expected to rise worldwide in the coming decades, which is largely due to the increasing exposure of elements at risk. Therefore, a comprehensive analysis of the economic context of the potentially affected areas is highly recommendable. Numerous papers have been published to date that focus on quantifying vulnerability in general and in areas affected by floods in particular. However, the number of studies devoted to flash flood-prone areas is far lower. Integrated economic vulnerability assessment enables one to learn what characteristics explain, trigger, intensify, and attenuate the exposure, sensitivity, and resilience of economically vulnerable populations, which can be combined to achieve an Integrated Economic Vulnerability Index (IEVI). The methodology deployed here was conducted in Castilla y Leon (northwest Spain; 94.223 km(2)) and has allowed the economic vulnerability of urban areas to be analyzed, which has been primarily addressed by the estimation of economic losses or, more recently, including a few economic variables within social vulnerability assessments. Thus, 118 economic variables were initially gathered and then divided into groups through a hierarchical segmentation analysis. Subsequently, variables were combined employing a principal components analysis, giving rise to the economic vulnerability factors that were subsequently aggregated to construct the IEVI. Tolerance statistic was used as a weighting method to define the IEVI, whereas quintiles were chosen as a statistical criterion to map economic vulnerability. As a final step, latent class cluster analysis was implemented to identify spatial patterns of vulnerability. Our findings show that IEVI scores have a high spatial variability and a high degree of complexity in the relationships among different vulnerability factors. Moreover, they help to identify spatial patterns of vulnerability, which makes the design of suitable vulnerability reduction strategies possible, thereby improving the efficiency of flood risk management plans and policies.

AB The one-dimensional advective-dispersive-reactive transport equation has been widely applied to describe the transportation process of landfill leachate through liners or anti-seepage curtains. However, most existing methods solving this problem are limited to simple initial conditions. In order to eliminate these limitations, homotopy analysis method (HAM) is implemented to solve the contaminant transport model in this paper. Applying auxiliary linear and nonlinear operator, zero order deformation equation is developed to solve contaminant transport problems numerically, with smooth initial conditions and variable source concentration being considered. HAM has been applied to simulate different contamination transport problems in one-dimensional space reported in literature. Good agreement between HAM solutions and analytical solutions has been achieved for all cases considered, demonstrating the feasibility of HAM to solve the contaminant transport model with more general, smooth initial conditions.

AB The evolution of the channel thalweg and pool-riffle sequences is a critical feature of morphological adjustments in fluvial systems and might have important effects on aquatic habitat quality, channel stability and navigation. Based on the 220 cross-sectional profiles from 2002 to 2016, residual depths and spatial statistical analyses were used to quantitatively analyse the vertical variations and longitudinal distribution of the pool-riffle sequences and channel thalweg in the Yichang-Chenglingji Reach (YCR) of the Middle Yangtze River, which consists of the Yizhi-Zhijiang, Shashi-Gongan and Shishou-Jianli sub-reaches. The results showed that the dramatic reduction in the sediment loads following the construction of the Three Gorges Darn (TGD) has caused significant adjustments in the size, morphological diversity and spatial distribution of pool-riffle structures in the YCR. The average depth of the pools in the Yizhi-Zhijiang Reach and the Shishou-Jianli Reach overall exhibited a nonlinear growth trend, with the average residual depth increasing by 1.4 m and 1.9 m, respectively. However, the average residual depth in the Shashi-Gongan Reach showed a decreasing trend, with a reduction of approximately 1.2 m. The longitudinal lengths of the riffles in all three reaches contracted to different degrees, and the specific percentage of longitudinal river length occupied by riffles (total riffle length/total sub-reach length) decreased by 8%, 9.6% and 5.9% in the three sub-reaches from upstream to the downstream. In addition, the morphological diversity of the thalweg elevation in the Shashi-Gongan Reach and Shishou-Jianli Reach weakened after the construction of the TGD, while the bed topography in the Yizhi-Zhijiang Reach became more complex and diverse. Moreover, the pool-riffle structures in the YCR were rearranged and distributed regularly following the initiation of the TGD operation, although the variation characteristics of the average pool spacing in the three sub-reaches were quite different. Quantitative relationship between the average residual depth and the previous four-year hydrological condition was proposed for the three sub-reaches based on the Delayed Response Model (DRM) and verified using the measurements from 2013 to 2016.

AB This study presents an investigation of probabilistic relationships between streamflow and hydroclimatic variables (including precipitation, temperature and soil moisture) and the potential links to large-scale atmospheric circulation over Baden-Wurttemberg, Southwest Germany. First, the joint dependence between seasonal streamflow and hydroclimatic variables was established by using copulas. On the basis of the joint dependence structure, we estimated the probabilities of hydrological droughts and prolonged high-streamflow events conditioned upon two different scenarios (high and low) of hydroclimatic variables for various seasons over the study area. The results indicate that both precipitation and soil moisture are positively related to the streamflow variation in Baden-Wiirttemberg for each season and strongly impact the likelihoods of hydrological droughts and high-streamflow events. Temperature tends to have less impact on the streamflow variation, and an inverse connection between streamflow and temperature is found in spring and summer. Then, the connections between streamflow variability and large-scale atmospheric circulation in summer and winter were explored by using composite analysis. Although the atmospheric circulation patterns vary in each season, it can be found that in summer high streamflow anomalies over Baden-Wiirttemberg are related to a cyclonic activity over central Europe while low streamflow anomalies are linked to anticyclonic patterns over western Ireland. The high streamflow anomalies in winter are strongly impacted by the westerlies that play an important role in favoring warm and moist airstreams from the Atlantic Ocean towards the study area, while an opposite atmospheric pattern is found for the years with low streamflow anomalies. The presented probabilistic methodology could also be applied in other regions worldwide.

AB Water saving irrigation systems (e.g. drip and sprinkler) conserve water but they can reduce potential groundwater recharge (PGR) over traditional systems (e.g. furrow) and may impair sustainability, particularly in arid and semi-arid regions. This study used a hybrid (experimental and numerical) approach to determine the effects of different irrigation systems on the dynamics of PGR in a semi-arid region. A 210-cm tall, 300-cm long and 150-cm wide soil column was prepared to simulate the soil environment of the Karaj region in Iran. A range of soil and environmental properties were monitored during a winter wheat cropping season (similar to 140 days) under different irrigation systems (treatments). Soil water content and drainage were measured under each irrigation system and these were used to a) calculate different components of water balance and b) model long-term soil water flow dynamics using HYDRUS-1D. About 14.83, 0.14 and 0.80% of the applied water (as irrigation and precipitation) under furrow, drip and sprinkler systems, respectively, were drained below 200 cm and this was estimated as the PGR. Annual PGR under furrow irrigation was estimated in the range of 19-228 mm, with an average of 111.3 mm. However, mean annual PGR under the sprinkler (4.1 mm) and drip (0.7 mm) was an order of magnitude lower than furrow irrigation. Deep drainage leading to PGR under the water saving methods was observed only after a very large rainfall event. The absence of large rainfall events between irrigations reduced PGR under water-saving irrigation systems in the arid and semi-arid region. The simulated model was further used to estimate the total amount of PGR over a 20-year period of wheat cultivation. Furrow irrigation estimated much higher amounts of PGR (222.7 cm) over drip and sprinkler systems; this raised questions about the sustainability of water-saving irrigation methods in the study area. As groundwater is the main source of irrigation in these areas, the recharge capacity of the adopted methods is critical to ensure the future availability and use of groundwater in the Karaj region of Iran as well as similar arid and semi-arid regions elsewhere.

AB Short-term power generation operation is an important content in the hydropower station management. Because of the limitation of forecast accuracy, there is error between the forecasted runoff process and actual runoff process. When the hydropower station operation is near the water level boundaries, such as normal water level or dead water level, this error is likely to bring the risk of water abandoning or output shortage. In order to precisely evaluate the near-boundary operation risk of hydropower station caused by runoff forecasting error, a novel panoramic fuzzy risk analysis model was proposed in this paper by taking the forecasting error as a fuzzy variable. The coupling of hydrological forecasting error and the short-term operation risk of hydropower station based on credibility theory was realized, and the solving process of the model based on fuzzy simulation technology was provided in detail. Different near-boundary operation risks of hydropower station can be analyzed and evaluated by the simulation with different water level combinations in this model. The high-risk area and suggested operation area of Jinxi hydropower station in different near-boundary operation situations were clearly identified in the case study. The intuitive results of this model can provide a strong technical support for the decision-making of the dispatchers when making the power generation plans in the actual production, so that to avoid the occurrence of water abandoning or output shortage of hydropower station, and effectively improve the efficiency of water resources utilization.

AB The large heterogeneity in soil surface conditions makes it impracticable to obtain reliable estimates of soil hydraulic parameters for areas larger than few squared kilometers. However, identifying these parameters on a global scale is essential for many hydrological and climatic applications. In this study, a new approach named Drainage from Drydown (DfD) is proposed to estimate the coefficients of drainage using soil moisture observations. DfD firstly selects multiple drydown events when surface runoff and evapotranspiration rates are negligible compared to the drainage rate. Secondly, by inverting the soil water balance equation, the drainage coefficients are obtained. Synthetic experiments are carried out in order to tune the overall procedure. DfD is then tested with in situ observations at 8 different sites worldwide characterized by different climates and soil types. The reliability of the DfD is evaluated by using the DfD drainage coefficients in a physically based soil water balance model (SWB) for simulating soil moisture and a rainfall estimation model (SM2RAIN). The results indicate that the climate and the soil conditions exert an important role in the occurrence and magnitude of drainage rate. DID is found capable of correctly identify periods in which drainage rate is the dominant process. Drainage coefficients obtained from DfD are consistent with the expected soil hydraulic properties based on the soil texture and land cover at each site. By using DfD drainage coefficients to estimate rainfall and soil moisture via SM2RAIN and SWB, promising results are obtained with median correlation of 0.83 and 0.91 between estimated and in situ data. However, in sites characterized by high rate of evapotranspiration ( > 700 mm/year) and low permeable soil (e.g., clay) the DfD performance is reduced. Overall, DM demonstrates the ability to decouple drainage and evapotranspiration processes and to estimate the drainage coefficients from in situ observations.

AB The Artificial Intelligence (AI) models i.e., Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Least Square Support Vector Machine (LSSVM) were used to statistically downscale and project rainfall data from CMIP5 General Circulation Models (GCMs) for Tabriz and Ardabil synoptic stations in north west Iran. Since one of the important issues in statistical downscaling of GCMs is to select dominant variables among plenty of large-scale climate data (predictors), a predictors screening framework, which integrates Wavelet-Entropy (WE) and Self-Organizing Map (SOM) was developed in this study to statistically downscale mean monthly rainfall values. The advantage of proposed method is to reduce the noise and dimensionality of data as well as selecting reliable inputs of downscaling model for future rainfall projection. To this end, five GCMs (i.e., Can-ESM2, BNU-ESM, CSIRO-ACCESS1, GFDL-ESM2G and INM-CM4) were employed. ANN, LSSVM and Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) models were trained to capture relationship between the predictors and the stations' observed rainfall values (predictand). Then, ensemble techniques were applied on the outputs of the downscaling models. The calibration, validation and projection of the proposed downscaling models were performed over the periods; Jan. 1951 to Dec. 1991, Jan. 1992 to Dec. 2005 and Jan. 2017 to Dec. 2100, respectively. The projection of rainfall for near and distant future (i.e., 2017-2050 and 2050-2100) by the proposed multi-GCM ensemble framework yielded to rainfall alteration pattern; 40-41% and 35-42% decrease at Tabriz station and 6-12% and 5-13% increase at Ardabil station under RCPs 4.5 and 8.5, respectively.

AB Turbulent bursting plays a crucial role in sediment resuspension and transportation in many shallow lakes. This study analyzed the relationships between coherent structures and sediment resuspension in regions with and without intense wind waves in Lake Taihu. Acoustic Doppler Velocimetry (ADV) and Optical Backscatter Sensor (OBS) were used to measure field data sets including flow velocities and intense wind waves respectively. The results showed that the intermittent bursting events contributed significantly to the processes of momentum and sediment exchanges. Turbulent bursting effectively controlled the three patterns of sediment suspension during the 512 s observation period. In the windy region, the bursting motions, i.e. "ejection" and "sweep" events mainly accounted for the Reynolds stress generation and made major contribution to sediment resuspension. While in the current-dominant region, turbulent mixing from inward and outward interactions overwhelmed other processes. The vertical sediment fluxes reduced by an order of magnitude due to the less effect of wind waves and the lack of upwelling currents. It is therefore important to study turbulent coherent structures and sediment resuspension to understand the spatio-temporal and frequency characteristics of bursting events.

AB The most distinguished characteristic of pervious concrete is its connected porosity that allows water to percolate. And the permeable capacity will decrease rapidly once the pervious concrete is clogged by the sediments. Despite the relationship between permeability and clogging is extensively researched, there is limited information about pore clogging mechanism in pervious pavements. The aim of this paper is using the computational fluid dynamics discrete element method (CFD-DEM) model to numerically reveal the pore clogging mechanism and clogging development taking into account of the porosity of pervious pavements, sediments size distribution, the horizontal runoff velocity, and the seepage velocity. Pore clogging is determined by the DA/D, ratio the equivalent diameter of aggregate particles (191) to equivalent diameter of sediments (D,). A fitted curve is utilized to depict the tendency of clogging. Sediments secondary movement is revealed. Results show that the well-graded sands is able to percolate into the depth of 30 mm in pervious pavements; coarse sands will settle on the shallow surface within depth of 20 mm in pervious pavements; and fine sands will percolate into the depth of 60-100 mm in pervious pavements. As the increase of porosity, horizontal runoff velocity, and seepage velocity, the sediments will transport into pervious pavements deeply. The cycle simulation of raining and draining shows it has limited influence to clogging.

AB The Songhua River Basin (SRB) plays a vital role in supplying water resources to northeast China. This river has a substantial effect on agricultural grain producing region. Therefore, the current study was carried out to evaluate the performances of multiple hydrological models driven by bias corrected precipitation estimates from a group of General Circulation Models (GCMs). The variations in discharge obtained from multiple hydrological models were also analyzed. For this purpose, bias correction methods for GCMs and five hydrological models, lumped rainfall runoff (Nedbor Afstromnings Model (NAM), GRJ4), semi-distributed (the Water Evaluation and Planning tool (WEAP), HBV), and the distributed (Soil Water Assessment Tool (SWAT)) were used in the SRB. Before applying the bias correction method, raw GCMs were also plotted against observational data. The results revealed that none of GCM performed well against observational data. The results also showed that quantile mapping method corrects the biases of GCMs better than daily and monthly scale factors. Distributed and semi distributed hydrological models performed better than lumped rainfall runoff models in the selected study area of SRB. By forcing hydrological models with bias corrected precipitation data, the differences in the simulated discharge by SWAT, HBV, NAM, GR4J and WEAP were -3%, -2%, -4%, -7 and + 3, respectively, when compared with observed discharge. The results also show that the overall performance of SWAT, HBV, NAM, and WEAP was better than GRJ4. The results also suggest that the application of multiple hydrological models is necessary to make improvements in the planning and management of agricultural and water resources in the SRB region.

AB Multiple uncertainty sources directly cause inaccurate simulations for water related processes in complicated integrated models, as such models include many interactive modules. A majority of existing studies focus on the uncertainties of parameter and model structure, and their effects on the model performance for a single process (e.g., hydrological cycle or water quality). However, comprehensive uncertainties of different modules and their propagations are poorly understood, particularly for the integrated water system model. This study proposes a framework of uncertainty and its propagation estimation for integrated water system model (HEQM) by coupling the Bootstrap resampling method and SCE-UA auto-calibration technique. Parameter and structure uncertainties of both hydrological cycle and water quality modules are estimated, including final distributions of parameters and simulation uncertainty intervals. Additionally, the effect of uncertainty propagation of hydrological parameters is investigated. Results show that: (1) HEQM simulates daily hydrograph very well with the coefficient of efficiency of 0.81, and also simulates the daily concentrations of ammonia nitrogen satisfactorily with the coefficient of efficiency of 0.50 by auto-calibration in the case study area; (2) The final ranges of all interested hydrological parameters are reduced obviously, and all the parameter distributions are well-defined and show skew. The uncertainty intervals of runoff simulation at the 95% confidence level bracket 18.7% of all the runoff observations due to uncertainties of parameter, and 86.0% due to both parameter and module structure, respectively; (3) The uncertainty propagation of hydrological parameters changes the optimal values of 37.5% of interested water quality parameters, but does not obviously change the water quality simulations which match well with the prior simulations throughout the period and bracket only 1.7% of observations at the 95% confidence level. Due to the further introduction of module structure uncertainties, 94.8% of observations are bracketed, only except the extreme high and low water quality concentrations; (4) The uncertainty of water quality parameters contributes 12.1% of total water quality simulations at the 95% confidence level. The figure increases to 21.0% and 92.0% if the uncertainty propagation of hydrological parameters, structure uncertainties of water quality module are considered, respectively. Therefore, although the parameter uncertainty and its propagation contribute a certain proportion of the whole simulation uncertainties, the module structure itself is the primary uncertainty source for the integrated water system model (HEQM), particular for the water quality modules.

AB Flow in a karst system in Lebanon (Important water supply source; Assal Spring; discharge 0.2-2.5 m(3)/s yearly volume of 22-30 Mm(3)), which is dominated by snow and semi-arid conditions, was simulated using an integrated numerical model (Mike She, 2016). The calibrated model (Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient of 0.77) is based on high resolution input data (2014-2017) and detailed catchment characterization. A sensitivity analysis of individual climatic parameters shows that spring hydrograph characteristics are most sensitive to temperature.
   A forward simulation using the IPS_cm5 model with the RCP6.0 scenario for future climate change (Global Climate Models GCM; daily downscaled bias and altitude corrected time series for Lebanon 2020-2099) unravel that precipitation, recharge, and discharge have moderate to highly significant decreasing trends with time over the 21st century. Moreover, recession flowrates are expected to drop drastically starting in the year 2070 to 11/s with shortage periods reaching up to six months. The latter is due to a temperature rise of + 1.5-2.5 degrees C and subsequent shrinking of snow cover by almost 100% (e.g., 2073-2074). Furthermore, this is accompanied by a decline in annual spring volume by 73% with respect to the current status, with real evapotranspiration consisting of up to 50% from total water budget (currently around 12-17% in 2014-2017). Moreover, decreasing snow accumulation and a more prominent flushing of precipitation event waters into fast preferential pathways will lead to peak spring discharges. This study allows decision makers to implement best informed practices for future water resources management especially for karst systems under semi-arid conditions in the regions.

AB Understanding the interaction between groundwater and surface water is of vital significance for the sustainable management of water resources in arid and semi-arid areas. In this study, multi environmental tracers (hydrochemical parameters, stable hydrogen and oxygen isotopes and radioactive Rn-222) were employed to investigate the interaction between groundwater and surface water along two rivers (Tiangeli River and Nomhon River) in the Nomhon area, southeast of the arid Qaidam Basin, northwest China. Here we observed that the Rn-222 concentration of waters were distinctly different with a decrease order of groundwater > spring > river in this area. Along the Tiangeli River, the Rn-222 concentrations of groundwater, springs and river water were about 12,120-17,407, 3013-15,819 and 809-8205 Bq/m(3), respectively. This river was characterized by the high Rn-222 concentration of the river water and was investigated to be mainly fed by springs and groundwater discharge. Along the Nomhon river, Rn-222 concentration of groundwater and river water was about 6772-60,369 and 14-519 Bq/m(3), respectively. An average background of the Rn-222 concentration in the upstream of the river was determined to be about 43 Bq/m(3). A high Rn-222 concentration zone along the river appeared in the midstream, with a peak value of 519 Bq/m(3) and a distance about 10 km, indicating that groundwater discharged to the Nomhon River in the alluvial plain. A Rn-222 mass-balance model was constructed to estimate the groundwater discharge into the river, showing a maximum groundwater discharge of 0.37 m(3)/s in the midstream of Nomhon River during the sampling period. The stable isotopic compositions (delta D and delta O-18) and hydrochemical characteristics (hydrochemical type, TDS and EC) showed corresponding changes along these two rivers, which also provided evidences for the groundwater-surface water interactions in the Nomhon area.

AB During flood control reservoir operation, uncertainties occur in flood forecasting, hydrograph shape, streamflow simulation, reservoir storage, water level, and discharge outflow. It is therefore important to analyze flood control risk due to these uncertainties. This study proposes a stochastic simulation method, comprising a copula based simulation method accounting for flood forecasting uncertainty, a copula-based single site daily stream flow simulation method for uncertainty in flood hydrograph, and the Latin hypercube sampling (LHS) method for uncertainty in storage, water level, and outflow discharge. Using the Three Gorges Reservoir (TGR) as a case study, the flood control risk, defined by traditional statistical and entropy methods, was calculated and compared. The proposed method satisfactorily preserved the statistical characteristics of the original streamflow series. Results from the TGR case study showed that the entropy method was effective for assessing flood risk due to different uncertainties. Thus, this study provides gives a comprehensive evaluation of flood risk during flood control reservoir operation.

AB Reservoirs and dams are vital human-built infrastructures that play essential roles in flood control, hydroelectric power generation, water supply, navigation, and other functions. The realization of those functions requires efficient reservoir operation, and the effective controls on the outflow from a reservoir or dam. Over the last decade, artificial intelligence (AI) techniques have become increasingly popular in the field of streamflow forecasts, reservoir operation planning and scheduling approaches. In this study, three AI models, namely, the backpropagation (BP) neural network, support vector regression (SVR) technique, and long short-term memory (LSTM) model, are employed to simulate reservoir operation at monthly, daily, and hourly time scales, using approximately 30 years of historical reservoir operation records. This study aims to summarize the influence of the parameter settings on model performance and to explore the applicability of the LSTM model to reservoir operation simulation. The results show the following: (1) for the BP neural network and LSTM model, the effects of the number of maximum iterations on model performance should be prioritized; for the SVR model, the simulation performance is directly related to the selection of the kernel function, and sigmoid and RBF kernel functions should be prioritized; (2) the BP neural network and SVR are suitable for the model to learn the operation rules of a reservoir from a small amount of data; and (3) the LSTM model is able to effectively reduce the time consumption and memory storage required by other AI models, and demonstrate good capability in simulating low-flow conditions and the outflow curve for the peak operation period.

TI Quantifying groundwater resilience through conjunctive use for irrigated

DE Groundwater; Drought; Conjunctive use; Irrigation; Resiliency
ID STREAM DEPLETION; RECHARGE; WATER; PLAIN
AB The Rincon Valley in arid, south-central New Mexico, is especially impacted by reduced surface water supply because the contribution of groundwater is limited by aquifer constraints. Consecutive surface water allotment shortages in the Elephant Butte Irrigation District (EBID) have reduced recharge. The effects are compounded by farmers continuing to extract groundwater to meet crop requirements. Conjunctive use assumes aquifer resilience (i.e., ability to absorb pumping stress), but not necessarily in drought. This study further develops the water table fluctuation method by analyzing data from the EBID's groundwater monitoring program to reveal conjunctive use controls over the spatial and interannual variability of net storage changes from 2009 to 2016 in the Valley and introduces the term groundwater-surface water ratio of application (GSRA), that has potential for characterizing system resilience in conjunctive use settings. Regression modeling shows that variation in the annual EBID surface water allotment correlates strongly with year-end water table elevations, even more strongly than total annual groundwater extractions for irrigation, suggesting that variable surface water allotments are a primary driver of this system. Dewatering of the aquifer as of 2011 significantly altered the system hydrology such that from 2011 to 2016, net change in storage correlates strongly with the annual surface water allotment, corresponding to large river losses for the same period, but resulting in net gains in storage from 2014 to 2016. Rapid storage loss and rebound in this constrained aquifer system allowed quantification of aquifer resilience, enabling the development of a GSRA as a potential planning metric.

The IMD and HRPPs are of the same spatial resolution (0.25 x 0.25) and extend from 1998 to 2015. The gridded precipitation datasets are compared for 25 river basins of India. TRMM, CMORPH, PERSIANN, and MSWEP datasets accuracy for the river basins are assessed by comparison with IMD using root mean square error (RMSE) and correlation coefficient (CC) methods. The Mann Kendall (MK) and modified Mann Kendall (MMK) tests are applied for analyzing the data trend, and the change is detected by Sen's Slope using all datasets for annual and seasonal time periods. Variation in precipitation is high ( > 20%) in the northern part of India in all datasets. All these basins located at the elevations above 2000 m. The annual and monsoon trend pattern for TMPA, CMORPH, PERSIANN, and MSWEP matched with IMD data in the north, northwest, and central part in 1-2, 22-25, and parts of 3, 12, and 21 river basins (1998-2015). The calculated results implied that the TMPA precipitation product (in terms of accuracy) and PERSIANN (in terms of annual and monsoon trend) show a better agreement with IMD and they can be used in climate studies and hydrological simulation in locations/river basins where the number of rain gauges is not adequate to quantify the spatial variability of precipitation.

AB Physically-based models are important tools for evaluating the hydraulic behaviour of urban drainage systems and, more specifically, assessing flood risk. While it is well known that such models should be calibrated and validated with monitoring data, overland runoff information is seldom available for this purpose. This study investigates the potential of using surveillance camera footage to measure surface flow velocity thanks to an LSPIV-based method called Surface Structure Image Velocimetry (SSIV). Seven real-scale experiments conducted in a specialized flood training facility were used to test the SSIV method under varied and challenging conditions. SSIV performance was evaluated by benchmarking bulk (mean) velocity against that measured by a conventional sensor array. In the best conditions tested, SSW and conventional flow sensors differed by only 1.7% (0.1% standard deviation). While the method proved sensitive to light conditions, our results suggest that infrared lighting could be used to increase measurement consistency. Our study concludes that for measuring overland flow velocity in urban areas, surveillance and traffic cameras can be considered as a low-maintenance and easy-to-install alternative to conventional sensor systems.

AB The aqueous geochemistry of the St. Peter Sandstone, a major aquifer in the Illinois Basin, an intracratonic sedimentary basin, is extremely complex. There are multiple sources of water, including in situ remnant brines, leakage from overlying and underlying units, and recharge during both the Pleistocene and Holocene Epochs. In our study region, recharge to the St. Peter Sandstone has come from multiple locations, and structural features, primarily the LaSalle Anticlinal Belt but also possibly the Sandwich Fault Zone, are a major control on recharge and groundwater flow. In the northern part of the study region, Holocene recharge has displaced most of the Pleistocene recharge, but in the rest of the study region considerable amounts of Pleistocene recharge still exist. The ion chemistry in the St. Peter Sandstone cannot be accounted for by simple mixing of Pleistocene recharge and in situ brines, and the most likely mechanism that could account for the aqueous chemistry is leakage of fluids from overlying formations via fractures opened by flexural loading during glacial advances. The water chemistry in the Western Region of our study area is clearly different from the Central and Eastern regions, having a more pronounced signature of Pleistocene water and suggesting different flow paths and sources of recharge. The large concentrations of SO42- and relatively high delta S-34 values in the Western wells suggest an up gradient source of anhydrite and/or gypsum, possibly from Mississippian evaporite deposits in Iowa.

AB The need for a method of estimating streamflow with both high-quality and high spatial resolution, particularly for ungauged sites, is critical under current circumstances: intensifying competition over water resources and limited streamgages. A source of accurate and timely computations of streamflow, particularly at high spatial resolutions, has been the National Hydrograph Dataset (NHD), a comprehensive geographic information system (GIS) dataset of vector-based surface water features such as streams, lakes, and streamgages in fine detail. Utilizing the NHD with streamflow data from the U.S. Geological Survey and usage records of local water utilities, this paper proposes a simple streamflow estimation method that computes streamflow at any point on river reaches of the NHD with valid hydrograph data and tests the method in a local 613 square mile watershed. The method assumes that linearly connecting the timings of peak or bottom-base flows from upstream to downstream hydrographs leads to retracing upstream lateral inflows that have eventually arrived at a user selected site between the upstream and downstream gauge stations of the hydrographs at any given time in a common period of record between the two hydrographs. Subsequently, the lateral inflows are added up to become the streamflow for a given site at a given time. NHD river networks and ArcGIS tools identify the locations of lateral inflows and the necessary parameters of the method. This paper assesses the results of the method by comparing them to measured streamflows through recommended evaluation statistics and visual inspection. The method has yielded promising results, including values of the Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency within 0.83 and 0.99 for daily streamflow estimates over seven years. It also credibly reconstructs missing daily streamflow over a considerable number of years.

AB Fluvial processes have a significant impact on buildings and infrastructure and despite their local character they cause annually considerable costs in mountain areas worldwide.
   Vulnerability studies are based mainly on empirical data from past events whereas laboratory studies investigating the impact forces on buildings are still limited.
   The paper presents a study on impact forces resulting from complex flow processes on buildings, the influencing factors they depend on and the identification of process parameters they correlate with.
   A 1:30 physical scale model was built, representing the torrential fan of the Schnannerbach torrent (Austria). Measurement devices, installed on the building structures located on the torrential fan, recorded impact forces induced by a set of fluviatile flood scenarios. The measured impact forces were compared to computation results using recently developed calculation approaches and to measurements resulting from experiments with a simplified, homogeneous scale model set-up with a single wall element in a rectangular flume. The results show a clear correlation between the approaching flow heights and the impact forces on exposed buildings. Compared to clear water conditions, bed-load transport and deposition processes highly influence the impact forces due to sediment accumulations close to the buildings on the torrential fan. The gained insights contribute to a better understanding of potentially damage-causing impacts on buildings resulting from the interaction of flood processes and the exposed built environment.

AB The use of radar rainfall estimates has been limited by the lack of a reliable method of obtaining operationally accurate radar-based rainfall estimates and the associated potential errors embedded in the retrieval process. Moreover, the existing approaches have difficulty merging ground- and radar-based measurements due to spatial and temporal variations in bias as well as the uncertainties in model parameters that also can affect the overall bias. This study proposes a novel approach for radar rainfall estimates using a hierarchical Bayesian model (HBM) in the context of bias correction. In particular, three different variations (i.e. the partial-pooling model (PPM), complete-pooling model (CPM), no-pooling model (NPM)) of the HBM are explored to better characterize the bias correction factor and the associated uncertainty. In the case of the CPM, rain gauges are assumed to have a constant bias level over the spatial domain, which results in a significant increase in RMSE. Conversely, in the NPM approach, the parameters are independently estimated for each station, resulting in an increase in the uncertainty of the parameters caused by compensating for the estimates of other parameters; this approach also leads to a substantial increase in the RMSE. Here, we introduce the PPM approach, which aims to jointly estimate correction factors across all gauging stations, while considering the covariance structure of both parameters and model errors. The results obtained for the PPM show a noticeable reduction in the uncertainty of the parameters when compared to that of the NPM. We also note a decline in the bias of radar rainfall estimates. Finally, we further utilize the proposed PPM-based bias correction approach as an ensemble generator for simulation of radar rainfall estimates. The simulated rainfall ensembles can satisfactorily reproduce key statistical properties retrieved from ground reference measurements.

AB Groundwater flow is one of the main driving factors in the erosion of streambanks, particularly during return flow of bank storage as sediment particles on the bank face may be entrapped or liquefied by seepage flow into the stream, and when acting in concert with fluvial forces. Previous research has mainly focused on seepage erosion mechanisms, whereas in this study, a remedial solution using randomly distributed 6-mm-long polypropylene fibers mimicking the behavior of plant roots in slopes was investigated by laboratory physical streambank model experiments. Reduced-scale sandy (14 kN/m(3) unit weight) streambank models (45 degrees bank slope) with dimensions of 195 cm long, 100 cm wide and 110 cm high were constructed in an erosion flume. Two different seepage gradients were generated within the streambanks by maintaining piezometric heads of 50 cm H2O and 100 cm-H2O in the upstream section of the erosion flume during experiments. Models were equipped with vibrating wire piezometers to measure the pore-water pressures within the streambank. In addition, tensiometers measured pore-water pressures near the wall section. Erosion of sediment from the streambank initiated concurrently as seepage flow emerged on the bare streambank surface. Erosion volumes were computed by three-dimensional laser scanning. Triaxial compression tests on sand samples (fiber gravimetric content ranged from 0% to 1.0%) indicated an increase in cohesion by fiber content. Fibrous streambank protection with 0.3% fiber content inclusion reduced the total amount of seepage erosion by 35%, and 47% under 50-, and 100 cm-H2O piezometric head boundary condition (BC), respectively. Seepage erosion rate and seepage discharge demonstrated a power-law relationship. Due to the increased cohesion, fibrous streambank protection with 1.0% fiber content effectively prevented seepage erosion during streambank experiments under the same BCs.

AB A first systematic study of the isotopic composition of precipitation on the Crimean Peninsula was carried over the period of 58 months at two stations located on the Crimean Piedmont (Simferopol, 290 m a.s.l.) and on the northern slope of the Main Range of the Crimean Mountains (Chatyr-Dag, 980 m a.s.l.). Oxygen and hydrogen isotope values of these stations yielded a Crimean Local Meteoric Water Line: delta H-2 = 7.3 delta O-18 + 4.8; r(2) = 0.97. The isotopic composition of precipitation at the two stations is partly (25% and 39%, respectively) correlated with the local air temperature, but the degree of this correlation shows large temporal variability. No correlation between isotopic composition and precipitation amount was observed. Far-field controls, such as changing sources, supplying moisture for the Crimean precipitation, or varying strength of the North Atlantic Oscillation do not influence the isotopic composition of precipitation in Crimea on these short time scales.

AB Global warming may affect the regime of hydroclimatic systems and induce more frequent occurrences of extremes, such as drought, heat wave and flood. Apart from the assessment of each extreme, recent decades have witnessed a surge in the study of compound extremes, i.e., the concurrence of multiple extremes. To aid the understanding of compound extremes, a variety of studies has been conducted to assess the dependence among different variables or extremes. As such, it is important to model multiple contributing variables of compound extremes to characterize the associated risk taking into account the dependence. In this study, a multivariate approach based on the meta-Gaussian model is proposed for the statistical analysis of compound extremes in the trivariate case. The application of the proposed approach is illustrated with the compound drought and hot extreme in the U.S. based on monthly precipitation, soil moisture and temperature from the North American Land Data Assimilation System (NLDAS-2). The likelihood of the occurrence of compound drought and hot extreme is assessed based on the joint distribution, which is shown to be higher in regions with significant land atmosphere interactions. The impact of precipitation and temperature on the occurrence of agricultural drought is also assessed based on the conditional distribution. Overall, results show that the proposed method provides a useful tool for statistical assessments of the compound extreme through constructing the joint and conditional distribution.

AB Reliability of flood stage and inundation extent predictions are affected by the performance of a hydraulic model. However, uncertainties at all times exist in the model setup process. Therefore, prediction from a single hydraulic model implementation may be subject to huge uncertainty. Bayesian model averaging (BMA) is applied in this study to combine ensemble predictions from different hydraulic model implementations and to develop a robust deterministic water stage prediction as well as the prediction distribution. The BMA approach is tested over the Black River watershed in Missouri and Arkansas based on water stage predictions from 81 LISFLOOD-FP model configurations that integrate four sources of uncertainty including channel shape, channel width, channel roughness and flow input. Model ensemble simulation outputs are trained with observed water stage data during one flood event to obtain the weight and variance for each model member, and BMA prediction ability is then validated for another flood event. The results indicate that the BMA approach is able to provide consistently good and reliable deterministic flood stage prediction across the basin, though it does not always outperform the best model in the ensemble. The BMA water stage prediction has better performance than the ensemble mean prediction. Additionally, high-chance flood inundation extent derived from a BMA probabilistic flood map is more accurate than the probabilistic flood inundation extent based on the equal model weights in the Black River watershed.

AB Hydrological-hydrodynamic modelling of basins, rivers and large bodies of water, such as lakes and lagoons, is usually performed by external coupling of hydrological-hydraulic models and 2D or 3D hydrodynamic models. Therefore, the river discharges into the lake are calculated by using the hydrologic model. The data is used then as an input to the hydrodynamic model. This approach allows for a detailed simulation of lake or lagoon hydrodynamics and circulation. However, when the objective is solely to simulate water levels and flooded areas, this approach may become too costly, making it difficult to establish operational systems such as those for flood forecasting. Therefore, in the present study, we propose a first integrated approach using one single hydrologic hydraulic model, the MGB-IPH model, to simulate complex systems such as wind shear influence. This model was applied to simulate the Patos Lagoon (PL) basin located in Brazil and Uruguay countries. Results showed that it was possible to use the single model to simulate hydrographs, flooded areas and water levels in the PL basin. Results of performance indicators in the lakes and lagoons were within the range of results available in the literature. Improvements of model performance metrics were verified with the inclusion of wind effect in the flow routing algorithm, thus encouraging the use of the proposed model for the establishment of flood forecasting systems or for the simulation of other similar hydrological systems.

AB The stage-discharge relationship is one of the frequently used methods for continuous river flow measurement. In the management of water resources and flood control, the accuracy of the rating curve is a key priority. Various methods have been proposed for estimating the stage-discharge curves in open channels, including the model of Ahmadi et al. (2017) in which the rating curve was identified by utilizing the information of discharge at a referenced water level. In the present study, a novel approach was taken to improve that model by modifying its basic assumptions and employing multi-objective optimization. To this end, multivariate relationships were presented to determine the actual mean velocity in the flow cross-section. The unknown exponents of the proposed relationships were obtained by using the second version of the Strength Pareto Evolutionary Algorithm (SPEA2), and the appropriate equation was selected by applying the TOPSIS (Technique for Order Preferences by Similarity to an Ideal Solution) approach. The validity of the proposed method was assessed across 6 artificial and 6 natural hydraulic cross-sections. Results showed a close agreement between the estimated and observed data. In the next step, the results of the proposed method were compared with those of the previous model using the Mann-Whitney U test. The results demonstrated that the proposed model was more efficient than the previous one.

ID PAST 50 YEARS; CHINA; TRENDS; ATTRIBUTION; MODEL
AB Pan evaporation, as a straightforward proxy of potential evapotranspiration, has consistently decreased during the last several decades in many regions across the globe mainly because of global dimming and/or decreases in wind speed. Based on a robust measurement dataset of 30-year large-pan evaporation, however, we found that recent increasing extreme climate events have reversed the decreasing trend in pan evaporation by the Lower Yellow River, with a significant increase of up to 25.2 mm/yr during 2008-2014. Further analyses show that the decrease in large-pan evaporation during 1985-2008 (-5.1 mm/yr) was mainly caused by the decreased vapor pressure deficit (VPD) and sunshine hours. While the sharp increase in large-pan evaporation after 2008 was mainly caused by more frequent heat wave and drought events in spring and summer, which resulted in concurrent increases in air temperature, VPD, and sunshine hours. Our finding of evaporation rebound due to heat wave and droughts calls for improved strategies of water and crop managements for mitigating the negative effects of increasing extreme climate events.

AB We study the role of a hydraulic fracture on the pressure transient behavior of a vertical well producing from a bounded (or finite) dual-porosity formation. A combination of Laplace transform (LT) and the finite Fourier cosine transform (FFCT) are used to solve the diffusivity equation. The presented analysis allows identification of five flow regimes, including: 1) early linear flow, 2) volumetric depletion of natural fractures, 3) natural-fracture radial flow, 4) transition from natural-fracture radial flow to total (natural fractures and matrix) radial flow, and 5) pseudo-steady state flow. The results reveal that the interporosity flow coefficient, storativity ratio, natural fracture permeability anisotropy, and reservoir size play significant roles on the identified flow regimes compared to the hydraulically fractured well location and reservoir shape. The developed solution can be useful for well test analysis by generating a new set of type curves or can be applicable to a forward model for estimating parameters of reservoir. This study presents a new semi-analytical solution which finds application in well testing of hydraulically fractured wells in dual-porosity formations.

AB The solution for the inverse problem of seawater intrusion at an aquifer scale has not been studied as extensively as forward modeling, because of the conceptual and computational difficulties involved. A three-dimensional variable-density conceptual phreatic model is developed by constraining with real-field data such as layering, aquifer bottom topography and appropriate initial conditions. The initial aquifer parameters are layered heterogeneous and spatially homogeneous that are based on discrete field measurements. The developed conceptual model shows poor correlation with observed state variables (hydraulic head and solute concentration), signifying the importance of spatial heterogeneity in hydraulic conductivity and dispersivity of all the layers. The conceptual model is inverted to estimate the anisotropic spatially varying hydraulic conductivity and the longitudinal dispersivity at the pilot points by minimizing the least square error of state variables across the observation wells. The inverse calibrated model is validated for the hydraulic head at validation wells and the solute concentration is validated with equivalent solute concentration derived from the electrical resistivity, which shows good results against the field measurements. The verification of estimated anisotropic hydraulic conductivity with the electrical resistivity tomography image shows good agreement. This investigation gives an insight about constraining the highly parameterized inverse model with real-field data to estimate spatially varying aquifer parameters for an effective simulation of the seawater intrusion in a layered coastal aquifer.

AB For overbank flows in meandering channels, the flow direction along a meander varies and is affected by floodplain vegetation. This study proposes a model for predicting the depth-averaged two-dimensional flow direction (depth-averaged flow angle) along a meander in smooth and vegetated meandering compound channels. Laboratory experiments were performed in smooth and vegetated channels. Measurements show that the height of the secondary current cell in the main channel is increased by dense floodplain vegetation comparing with that in a non-vegetated channel. A method of determining the height of the cell is proposed. At the middle section between the apex and exit sections, where the secondary current cell is absent, the depth averaged flow angle is independent of the height of the cell. Beyond the middle section, a new secondary current cell is formed, and the flow angle is highly dependent on the height of the cell. The proposed model is thoroughly verified using the flume experimental and field observed data. Good agreement is obtained between predictions and measurements, indicating that the proposed model is capable of accurately predicting the depth-averaged flow angle along a meander in smooth and vegetated meandering compound channels.

AB The vaporization plane in porous media separates the region of capillary flow from the dry surface layer, where the water transports only in its gas phase. Knowledge of the depth and geometry of the vaporization plane is critical for estimating water flux in the soil-atmosphere interphase, for understanding evaporating processes in general, and for prediction of locations of damaging salt crystallization, etc. However, detection of the vaporization plane is a challenging task. This paper explores the use of sodium fluorescein dye (uranine), a popular hydrological tracer, to visualize the vaporization plane in porous media. Uranine was used in the forms of solution or powder on sand, sandstone, and autoclaved aerated concrete, in both laboratory and field experiments. The property of uranine solution to change its color according to its concentration can be used to: i) visualize the vaporization plane by forming a distinctive dark-orange zone where the pore water evaporates, and ii) to distinguish the zone of vapor flow from the zone where capillary flow is present. Similarly, uranine powder, when applied onto a porous material, clearly visualizes the dry surface layer and the capillary zone, divided by the vaporization plane. This technique can also visualize a complex-shaped vaporization plane in hydrophobic materials. In comparison with other techniques, such as sensible heat balance or heat pulse methods, the use of uranine is accurate, cost-effective, and straightforward.

AB Flood coincidence risk analysis is of great significance for reservoir operation and flood control. Traditional research only focuses on the coincidence of flood peak. Actually, when half or more than half of flood hydro graphs of two rivers are overlapping, the flood event should be defined as flood coincidence. Thus, during the flood coincidence analysis, the whole hydrograph information should be considered. This study proposes a flood hydrograph coincidence analysis method in which flood magnitudes of two flood hydrographs and flood interval time are taken as three reference variables. The Pearson Type III distribution and the mixed von Mises distribution were selected as the marginal distributions for flood magnitudes and flood interval time, respectively. Then three-dimensional copula functions were used to establish the joint distribution of these variables. Selecting the upper Yangtze River in China as a study, the characteristics of flood interval time were analyzed and the coincidence probabilities of flood hydrograph for different return periods were calculated. Results showed that the selected marginal and joint distributions fitted the observed flood data well. For floods occurring in the Jinsha River, MM River and Jialing River, the coincidence probabilities between any of those rivers were higher. The coincidence probabilities between the Wu River and the other three rivers mentioned above were lower. The calculated coincidence probabilities by the proposed method were compared with those by the traditional statistical method. Results indicated that those values were nearly the same and the proposed method reflected the actual coincidence situation.

AB The presented paper describes spatial and temporal variations in extended stable isotope datasets of hydrogen and oxygen (delta H-2 and delta O-18) in the Sava River water that were used to estimate the mean residence time (MRT) of stream water using an exponential flow model. The re-examining MRT was < 2 years in the Slovenian part of the Sava River and was in a good agreement with previous estimates and with the MRT estimated in the Sava River at Ostrulnica near Belgrade, Serbia. A MRT > 2.2 years was observed in the Danube River at Vina also near Belgrade. The spatial distribution of delta O-18 in precipitation over the Sava River Basin (SRB) was mapped based on the long-term weighted mean annual delta O-18 values and established relationship with various geographical controls (latitude, longitude and altitude). The modelled delta O-18 values in precipitation agree with the measured values in the surface river water at different locations indicating that the spatial variation in the isotopic composition of precipitation is the dominant factor controlling surface water isotope ratios over the SRB.

AB Tree pits are attractive stormwater control measures (SCMs) for implementation in dense urban areas because of their small footprint, their potentially low cost and the co-benefits they may bring through improved street tree growth. While they provide street trees with passive irrigation, it remains to be determined if tree pits may achieve meaningful reductions in stormwater runoff. We undertook a streetscape experiment to quantify runoff retention of tree pits in a heavy clay soil with low-rates of exfiltration. We calibrated and validated a water balance model using the field experiment data to identify tree pit characteristics driving runoff retention performance. We then applied the model to different implementation scenarios to ascertain how useful these tree pits may be at reducing runoff to return a more natural flow regime in dense urban areas. The main drivers of runoff retention were identified as exfiltration rates from the tree pits and the connected impervious catchment size. Our results show that it is possible, even in dense urban streetscapes with low conductivity (heavy-clay) soils, to achieve a 90% reduction in annual runoff and to reduce days of runoff to just 15 days per year. However, to achieve this, tree pits need to be sized between 2.5% and 8% of the impervious catchment area, depending on pit exfiltration rates. In practice, achieving these tree pit to catchment area ratios for a dense urban streetscape will require consideration in the planning stages of development works and is expected to be most feasible through implementation of tree pits alongside a suite of other complementary SCMs.

TI Bridging iterative Ensemble Smoother and multiple-point geostatistics

AB Inverse method can be used to fill the gap between huge amount of data from sensors and complex groundwater model. The iterative Ensemble Smoother (iES) is one of the most efficient algorithms applied to groundwater modeling for data assimilation. However, the iES only works for multi-Gaussian fields, because two-point statistics are used to estimate the co-relation between state variables and parameters. In curvilinear geometries, such as sinuous channels in fluvial deposits, the distribution of hydraulic conductivity is non-multiGaussian. Multiple-Point Geostatistics (MPG) method has gained popularity for modeling curvilinear structures by conditioning on directly measured data, such as conductivities. This paper is aimed at bridging the iES and MPG method via pilot points to deal with inverse problem for further conditioning on indirect data, such as piezometric head, in non-Gaussian fields. As a result, the better flow and transport modeling will be achieved because both data and the concept model (e.g., geological structures) are honored after data assimilation. To do that, the iES is used to update conductivities at pilot points by assimilating indirect data, then the updated values at pilot points together with measured conductivities will be used as hard data to model hydraulic conductivity field via Direct Sampling, an MPG method. A synthetic example was used to demonstrate the methodology in terms of characterization of conductivity and flow and transport predictions. The results show that this new approach can not only assimilate dynamic data into groundwater flow model but also preserve curvilinear structures.

AB We perform a comparative study of water discharge from Euclidean and fractal reservoirs. The Euclidean reservoir is modeled by a filter with a translationally invariant cubic network of straight square channels. As a model of fractal reservoir with the scale invariant pore network we use a pre-fractal inverse Menger sponge. The gravity-driven discharge experiments were carried out with two different setups. In the first setup, a porous filter is fixed in container above a lateral exit duct. In the second setup, the exit duct is connected to one of lateral exits of the pore network. In both cases, we found that the squared outflow velocity is a linear function of water table elevation above exit orifice. Hence, the water discharge is governed by the Bemoulli's principle rather than by the Darcy's law. Furthermore, we found that filters placed above the exit duct have no effect on the discharge rate, because absolute permeabilities of both filters are large enough to supply water into the volume between filter's bottom and exit orifice. Conversely, when the exit duct is connected to the lateral exit of the pore network, the water discharge from the inverse Menger sponge is faster than from the Euclidean reservoir. Experimental data fittings with a modified Torricelli's equation suggest that a loss of mechanical energy of flowing water in the fractal pore network is less than in the translationally invariant network of channels. This finding reveals that an effective wetted area along a flow path of least resistance in the self-similar pore network is smaller less than in the periodic network of straight channels. So, the fractal features of the pore network can have a strong impact on hydrological processes in natural reservoirs and karst aquifers which commonly possess statistical scale invariance.

AB At the in-situ Long Term Sorption Diffusion Experiment (LTDE-SD), performed in the Aspo Hard Rock Laboratory (Sweden), anomalous penetration profiles of tracers were observed. The concentration of sorbing tracers, particularly Cs-137, sharply decreased around the rock surface but was still quite high in the distance, which was known that it is difficult to model with the classic Fick's law. To understand the mechanism of matrix diffusion and sorption of solute by reproducing the observed penetration profiles in the LTDE-SD test, three cases for the matrix were proposed and evaluated: (1) homogeneous medium with a disturbed zone; (2) heterogeneous medium considering mineral grains with intragranular porosities and their intergranular pores; and (3) heterogeneous medium considering vein and microfractures as well as porous mineral grains and intergranular pores. The modelling domains for Cases 2 and 3 were established using 2-D microstructure characterization results from analyses including chemical staining of minerals and C-14-PMMA autoradiography. The numerical models for Cases 1-3 were calibrated by minimizing the discrepancies between simulations and observations of the penetration profiles and the changes in concentration in the reservoir for the tracers, Cs-137 and Na-22. The results show that only the calibrated transport parameter values for Case 3 were within the reported ranges, and we concluded that the sharp decrease in concentrations in the near-surface zone in the observed penetration profiles was likely to result from disturbed biotite grains and the long tails in the observed penetration profiles might originate from diffusion along the vein and microfractures transacting minerals.
