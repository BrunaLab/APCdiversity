AB The recently reported aptamer kissing complex (AKC) strategy has allowed for the development of a new kind of sandwich-like sensing tools. Currently AKC assays have been only applied to low molecular weight molecules and their functionality in complex matrices remains challenging. The objective of the present study broken down into two sub-aims; exploring the propensity to broaden the scope of detectable analytes and designing a more robust system for potential applications to realistic samples. An all L-configuration aptaswitch module derived from a hairpin spiegelmer specific to a larger target, i.e. the arginine-vasopressin (AVP) hormone, was elaborated. The target-induced AKC formation in presence of a specific mirror-image RNA hairpin (L-aptakiss) probe were analyzed by using fluorescence anisotropy. The mirror-image kissing complex was successfully formed when the L-AVP target bound to the engineered L-aptaswitch element. It was also established that the use of methanol as cosolvent significantly improved the assay sensitivity through the stabilization of the ternary complex. Finally, the capability of the mirror-image method to operate in 10-fold diluted, untreated human serum was illustrated. The current work revealed that the AKC concept can be expanded to a wider range of targets and converted to a L-configuration sensing platform especially suitable for bioanalysis purposes.

AB Reciprocal signaling between stromal and tumor cells was believed to contribute to tumor cell proliferation and apoptosis in heterocellular systems. Herein we used the CO2-sensitive AIEgen as bioprobe to study the synergistic effect of stromal cells and tumor cells in a heterocellular system. The experimental results demonstrated that metabolic rates of living tumor cells in the co-culture system were still faster than that of stromal cell through the detection of CO2 generation rate in living cell. All rates were, however, slower than that in homocellular system. It indicated that tumor cells would induce neighboring stromal cells to establish a common protection mechanism against foreign material invasion, which enhanced the cell activity and drug resistance. In addition, tumor cells in solid carcinoma exhibited delayed growth but less apoptosis in co-culture systems. Taken these results together, a bidirectional signaling pathway theory was proposed between tumor and stromal cells in co-culture system and could play a different and important role in anticancer drug molecules designs.

AB A novel analytical method was developed for quantitative determination of eight limonene-derived monoterpenes responsible for the mint aroma in red wine. As these aromatic compounds are present at trace levels, a new dual extraction approach was proposed, combining solid-phase extraction (SPE) and stir bar sorptive extraction (SBSE), followed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis. The various parameters affecting the efficiency of extracting the analytes from wine samples in both the SPE and SBSE steps were first investigated, to determine the best compromise for the simultaneous analysis of the compounds studied. Following preliminary optimization of the dilution factor, phase ratio, and methanol content in the SBSE sample, cartridge sorbent mass, type of solvent, elution volume, and wine sample volume in the pre-concentration SPE step were studied. Highest response values were obtained when a 90 mL wine sample was extracted on a 500 mg SPE C18 cartridge and eluted with 1.5 mL methanol. The wine extract was then diluted in 10 mL water to obtain a final methanol content of 15% before the SBSE step. Good linearity, repeatability, reproducibility, accuracy and the required low detection and quantification limits were obtained under the conditions described, making this SPE-SBSE combination a suitable, powerful tool for routine analysis of the selected limonene-derived mint aroma compounds in large series of wine samples. Finally, the validated method was applied to 15 commercial red Bordeaux wines, aged from 3 to 23 years. Most of the compounds studied, present within the ng.L-1 range, were easily quantified for the first time in wine. (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB New imine-linked molecularly imprinted covalent organic frameworks (MICOFs) were successfully prepared, using fenvalerate as the dummy template. Schiff base reaction between 1,3,5-tris(4-aminophenyl) benzene and 1,3,5-triformylphloroglucinol was rapidly achieved at room temperature, using Sc(OTf)(3) as the catalyst. The surface groups and morphologies of MICOFs were assessed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, Brunauer-Emmett-Teller surface area analysis, and scanning electron microscopy. The MICOFs exhibited high selectivity toward four structurally similar cyano pyrethroids, including fenvalerate, flucythrinate, beta-cyfluthrin and lambda-cyhalothrin. A method based on solid phase extraction using MICOFs coupled to high performance liquid chromatography was established for the determination of cyano pyrethroids in plant samples. Linearity in the range 0.1-200 ng g(-1), with correlation coefficients of 0.9981-0.9993, was obtained for the four cyano pyrethroids. Detection limits and quantification limits were in the range 0.011-0.018 ng g(-1) and 0.036-0.060 ng g(-1), respectively. Recoveries at three spiked levels ranged from 94.3% to 102.7%. The developed method is thus a promising technique for the selective extraction of cyano pyrethroids from complex matrices. (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB For analyte detection in raw fruits, the conventional sample pretreatment method usually involves mashing (blending or homogenization), extraction, and dilution. This process is time-consuming, solvent-intensive and laborious. Usually, there is also a lot wastage with multiple fruits being combined into composite samples. In this work, a new micro-sampling approach based on a syringe needle is developed; it was coupled with micro liquid-phase extraction to determine and quantify D-glucose in bananas. This sampling and extraction approach was quick, easy and required only minimal use of solvent. The D-glucose in the extracted banana flesh was first oxidized enzymatically with glucose oxidase. The resulting peroxide was then detected colorimetrically via oxidation of 3,3',5,5'-tetramethylbenzidine in the presence of a catalyst. The latter, consisting of an iron (III) enickel (II) layered double hydroxide (LDH[Ni-II-Fe-III]) was synthesized in this work for the purpose. The results of this new detection method for D-glucose in fruits provided low limits of detection (0.025 mu g/mL), wide linear range (0.1-3000 mu g/mL) and good linearity (r(2) = 0.9998). Quantification of D-glucose using this approach was applied to banana samples over a period of 10 days. The results showed that the D-glucose levels in bananas increased as the fruits ripened, as expected. This work demonstrated a new and interesting approach for easy and efficient detection of analytes in raw fruit samples. (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Solid-phase microextraction (SPME) is an approach to sample preparation that has demonstrated its appropriateness for isolating/enriching analytes present in complex biofluids with minimum sample pretreatment. Several prior in vitro and in vivo studies have used SPME to monitor the concentrations of various drugs and metabolites in blood samples. In this work, we present the results of an investigation into how various levels of hematocrit (Hct) affect SPME recoveries. The matrices for this study consisted of whole blood samples that had been adjusted at three different Hct levels (20%, 45%, and 70%), and the selected model compounds were drugs with different physicochemical characteristics (log P range from 0.33 to 6.36). In addition, two experimental setups were employed to conduct the extractions: hydrophilic lipophilic balanced (HLB) coated SPME devices (HLB-D) at 1500 rpm (vortex agitation), and mixed mode SPME fibres (MM-F) at 400 rpm (orbital shaking agitation). Our results demonstrated that the Hct effect in SPME is dependent on the analytes of interest, and that different outcomes can be attained by altering experimental conditions, such as coating type, convection, and extraction time. Interestingly, a target compound's relative affinity for the matrix components and for the coating material proved to be one of the main factors that determine the final effect that different erythrocyte levels have on SPME recoveries. Finally, although the Hct content affects each analyte differently and the final Hct effect depends on the experimental parameters, matrix variability can be corrected by using appropriate internal standards, thereby resulting in correct quantification.

AB In this paper we present a new analytical GC/MS method for the analysis of mixtures of free fatty acids and metal soaps in paint samples. This approach is based on the use of two different silylating agents: N,O-bis(trimethylsilyl)trifluoroacetamide (BSTFA) and 1,1,1,3,3,3-hexamethyldisilazane (HMDS).
   Our experimentation demonstrated that HMDS does not silylate fatty acid carboxylates, so it can be used for the selective derivatization and GC/MS quantitative analysis of free fatty acids. On the other hand BSTFA is able to silylate both free fatty acids and fatty acids carboxylates. The reaction conditions for the derivatization of carboxylates with BSTFA were thus optimized with a full factorial 3(2) experimental design using lead stearate and lead palmitate as model systems. The analytical method was validated following the ICH guidelines. The method allows the qualitative and quantitative analysis of fatty acid carboxylates of sodium, calcium, magnesium, aluminium, manganese, cobalt, copper, zinc, cadmium, and lead and of lead azelate. In order to exploit the performances of the new analytical method, samples collected from two reference paint layers, from a gilded 16th century marble sculpture, and from a paint tube belonging to the atelier of Edvard Munch, used in the last period of his life (1916-1944), were characterized.

AB 9-Xanthydrolwas introduced as an assisted-extraction-reagent to quantify ethyl carbamate (EC) in wines by heart-cutting multidimensional gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (MDGC-MS). 9-Xanthydrol could help to increase the extraction efficiency, because it could react with ethyl carbamate to form the low-polar product, which facilitated the transfer of ethyl carbamate into organic phase. Then the reaction product was decomposed in high temperature, so ethyl carbamate could be obtained again in injector port. Heart-cutting multidimensional gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry was used not only for avoiding 9-xanthydrol interference but also for getting a larger volume injector, higher sensitivity and lower limit of detection. The method was optimized and validated in terms of sample volume, sodium chloride, the acid concentration, the 9-xanthydrol concentration and the reaction time. Good linear relationship (R-2 = 0.9998) over the concentration range of 2.00 mu g L-1 -200.00 mu g L-1 was obtained. The limit of detection (LOD, 0.02 mu g L-1) and quantification (LOQ, 0.10 mu g L-1) were lower than previously reported. The RSDs of precision (repeatability and reproducibility) were lower than 8.15%, and the recovery (96.17-99.25%) and accuracy (99.21-110.93%) were validated as well. This methodology was applied to the quantification of ethyl carbamate in several different fermented wines with values ranging from 13.05 to 155.20 mu g L-1. (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB The effects of MS1 injection time, MS2 injection time, dynamic exclusion time, intensity threshold, and isolation width were investigated on the numbers of peptide and protein identifications for single-shot bottom-up proteomics analysis using CZE-MS/MS analysis of a Xenopus laevis tryptic digest. An electrokinetically pumped nanospray interface was used to couple a linear-polyacrylamide coated capillary to a Q Exactive HF mass spectrometer. A sensitive method that used a 1.4 Th isolation width, 60,000 MS2 resolution, 110 ms MS2 injection time, and a top 7 fragmentation produced the largest number of identifications when the CZE loading amount was less than 100 ng. A programmable autogain control method (pAGC) that used a 1.4 Th isolation width, 15,000 MS2 resolution, 110 ms MS2 injection time, and top 10 fragmentation produced the largest number of identifications for CZE loading amounts greater than 100 ng; 7218 unique peptides and 1653 protein groups were identified from 200 ng by using the pAGC method. The effect of mass spectrometer conditions on the performance of UPLC-MS/MS was also investigated. A fast method that used a 1.4 Th isolation width, 30,000 MS2 resolution, 45 ms MS2 injection time, and top 12 fragmentation produced the largest number of identifications for 200 ng UPLC loading amount (6025 unique peptides and 1501 protein groups). This is the first report where the identification number for CZE surpasses that of the UPLC at the 200 ng loading level. However, more peptides (11476) and protein groups (2378) were identified by using UPLC-MS/MS when the sample loading amount was increased to 2 mu g with the fast method. To exploit the fast scan speed of the Q-Exactive HF mass spectrometer, higher sample loading amounts are required for single-shot bottom-up proteomics analysis using CZE-MS/MS. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB In this work, a low-power (<25 W), portable direct current (dc) atmospheric pressure glow discharge microplasma (4 mm x 10 mm) molecular emission spectrometer (APGD-MES) is developed for the determination of nitrite by using chemical vapor generation. Nitrite is on-line reduced to volatile nitric oxide (NO) by 1.5% (m/v) ascorbic acid and 1.0 mol L-1 hydrochloric acid. Then, the generated NO was separated and transferred into the APGD microplasma by an argon stream (100 mL min(-1)) for its excitation, and NO emission was measured by a microspectrometer. The effects of operational parameters of the APGD microplasma source and vapor generation of nitrite were investigated and the analytical figures of merit for nitrite detection was evaluated. The limit of detection of the proposed method was calculated to be 0.26 mu g mL(-1) of nitrite by measuring NO emission at 237.0 nm. The calibration curve is linear for the nitrite concentration in the range of 2.0-100.0 mu g mL(-1) and good precision (2.3%, RSD) is readily achieved for 5.0 mu g mL(-1) nitrite. The accuracy of this procedure was demonstrated by nitrite detection in a certified reference material. Analyte recoveries test were also performed to verify the accuracy of the method for nitrite determination in a series of environmental water samples. It was found that the concentration of nitrite of these samples were all below the LOD, and the obtained recoveries were in the range of 95-117%. The proposed APGD-MES method provides an alternative useful technique for screening potential nitrite pollution of potable waters. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Sensitive and accurate detection of uracil-DNA glycosylase (UDG) activity is available for evaluating and validating their function in uracil base-excision repair (UBER) pathway and clinical diagnosis. Here, a sensitive and accurate method for UDG activity detection was developed on the basis of self-primer and self-template recycle rolling circle amplification (Self-RRCA) strategy. First, an immature template (IT) with a uracil base and an Nt.BbvCI nicking site was designed, which could hybridize with a designed primer to form a pre-amplicon probe (PA probe). Under the action of UDG, the uracil base in the PA probe could be removed to generate an apyrimidinic (AP) site. Then the generated AP site was excised by endonuclease IV (endo IV), making the PA probe form a RCA amplicon through reconformation. The RCA amplicon subsequently was used to trigger the RCA, and after Nt.BbvCI nicking reaction, new amplicons were released to initiate next RCA, constituting a Self-RRCA. In this method, the designed IT was not fully complementary with the primer in the ligation part, which could effectively avoid nonspecific ligation reaction and eventually effectively avoid nonspecific amplification. Compared with the linear RCA, the Self-RRCA exhibited higher amplification efficiency. Due to above advantages, a sensitive and accurate detection method was achieved with a limit of 4.68 x 10(-5) U mL(-1). Furthermore, the method was adopted to screen the inhibitor of UDG and assay the activity of UDG in HeLa cell lysate. This method will offer a promising analysis tool for further biomedical research of UDG and clinical diagnosis. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB For use in the voltammetric sensing of galactose-dependent proteins, we modified magnetic beads with a peptide that had both electroactive- and molecular recognition properties. The peptide consisted of a YXY sequence and behaved as an electron-transfer carbohydrate-mimetic peptide that would combine with proteins. With this tool, the protein could be detected via a label-free system. We synthesized several penta-and hexa-peptides with a cysteine residue on the C-terminals to examine the properties of peptides. These peptides contained amino acid residues (X) of alanine, serine, or tyrosine. The peptides were immobilized on magnetic beads via N-(8-maleimidocapryloxy) succinimide. Soybean agglutinin(SBA), the in vivo function of which has been well established in animals, was selected as a model protein. The protein was detected via the changes in electrode response due to the oxidation of tyrosine residues from the phenol group to quinone. As a result, SBA was selectively accumulated on the beads modified with YYYYC. The calibration curve of SBA was linear and ranged from 2.5 x 10(-12) to 1.0 x 10(-10) M. With this system, SBA was recovered in human serum at values that ranged from 98 to 103%. Furthermore, the beads with peptides were regenerated five times using a protein denaturant. Accordingly, this electrochemical system was simple and could be rapidly applied to the detection of galactose-recognition proteins. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This paper presents a novel spectrum analysis tool named synergy adaptive moving window modeling based on immune clone algorithm (SA-MWM-ICA) considering the tedious and inconvenient labor involved in the selection of pre-processing methods and spectral variables by prior experience. In this work, immune clone algorithm is first introduced into the spectrum analysis field as a new optimization strategy, covering the shortage of the relative traditional methods. Based on the working principle of the human immune system, the performance of the quantitative model is regarded as antigen, and a special vector corresponding to the above mentioned antigen is regarded as antibody. The antibody contains a pre-processing method optimization region which is created by 11 decimal digits, and a spectrum variable optimization region which is formed by some moving windows with changeable width and position. A set of original antibodies are created by modeling with this algorithm. After calculating the affinity of these antibodies, those with high affinity will be selected to clone. The regulation for cloning is that the higher the affinity, the more copies will be. In the next step, another import operation named hyper-mutation is applied to the antibodies after cloning. Moreover, the regulation for hyper-mutation is that the lower the affinity, the more possibility will be. Several antibodies with high affinity will be created on the basis of these steps. Groups of simulated dataset, gasoline near-infrared spectra dataset, and soil near-infrared spectra dataset are employed to verify and illustrate the performance of SA-MWM-ICA. Analysis results show that the performance of the quantitative models adopted by SA-MWM-ICA are better especially for structures with relatively complex spectra than traditional models such as partial least squares (PLS), moving window PLS (MWPLS), genetic algorithm PLS (GAPLS), and pretreatment method classification and adjustable parameter changeable size moving window PLS (CA-CSMWPLS). The selected pre-processing methods and spectrum variables are easily explained. The proposed method will converge in few generations and can be used not only for near-infrared spectroscopy analysis but also for other similar spectral analysis, such as infrared spectroscopy.

AB Analytical chemistry is rapidly changing. Indeed we acquire always more data in order to go ever further in the exploration of complex samples. Hyperspectral imaging has not escaped this trend. It quickly became a tool of choice for molecular characterisation of complex samples in many scientific domains. The main reason is that it simultaneously provides spectral and spatial information. As a result, chemometrics has provided many exploration tools (PCA, clustering, MCR-ALS.) well-suited for such data structure at early stage. However we are today facing a new challenge considering the always increasing number of pixels in the data cubes we have to manage. The idea is therefore to introduce a new paradigm of Topological Data Analysis in order explore hyperspectral imaging data sets highlighting its nice properties and specific features. With this paper, we shall also point out the fact that conventional chemometric methods are often based on variance analysis or simply impose a data model which implicitly defines the geometry of the data set. Thus we will show that it is not always appropriate in the framework of hyperspectral imaging data sets exploration. (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

   RESOLUTION
AB In matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI MS) analysis and imaging of lipids, comprehensive ionization of lipids simultaneously by a universal matrix is a very challenging problem. Ion suppression of readily ionizable lipids to others is common. To overcome this obstacle and enhance the coverage of MALDI MS analysis and imaging of lipids, we developed a novel strategy employing a mixture of matrices, each of which is capable of selective ionization of different lipid classes. Given that MALDI MS with either 9-aminoacridine (9-AA) or N-(1-naphthyl) ethylenediamine dihydrochloride (NEDC) yields weak in-source decay which is critical for analysis of complex biological samples and possesses orthogonal selectivity for ionization of lipid classes, we tested the mixtures of NEDC and 9-AA with different ratios for analysis of standard lipids and mouse brain lipid extracts. We determined 1.35 of NEDC/9-AA as an optimized molar ratio. It was demonstrated that an enhanced coverage with the optimized mixture was obtained, which enabled us to analyze and map all the major classes of phospholipids and sulfatide from either lipid extracts or tissue slides, respectively. We believe that this powerful novel strategy can enhance lipidomics analysis and MALDI MS imaging of lipids in a high-throughput and semi-quantitative fashion. (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB For many sample matrices, matrix effects are a troublesome phenomenon using the electrospray ionization source. The increasing use of supercritical fluid chromatography with CO2 in combination with the electrospray ionization source for MS detection is therefore raising questions: is the matrix effect behaving differently using SFC in comparison with reversed phase LC? This was investigated using urine, plasma, influent-and effluent-wastewater as sample matrices. The matrix effect was evaluated using the post-extraction addition method and through post-column infusions. Matrix effect profiles generated from the post-column infusions in combination with time of flight-MS detection provided the most valuable information for the study. The combination of both qualitative and semi-quantitative information with the ability to use HRMS-data for identifying interfering compounds from the same experiment was very useful, and has to the authors' knowledge not been used this way before. The results showed that both LC and SFC are affected by matrix effects, however differently depending on sample matrix. Generally, both suppressions and enhancements were seen, with a higher amount of enhancements for LC, where 65% of all compounds and all sample matrices were enhanced, compared to only 7% for SFC. Several interferences were tentatively identified, with phospholipids, creatinine, and metal ion clusters as examples of important interferences, with different impact depending on chromatographic technique. SFC needs a different strategy for limiting matrix interferences, owing to its almost reverse retention order compared to RPLC. (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In recent years, various enzymatic microreactors and on-line enzyme digestion strategies have been widely applied in high throughput proteome analysis. However, the incomplete and irreproducible digestion would introduce some unexpected variations in comparative proteome quantification when the samples are digested and then chemically isotope labeled in different aliquots. To address these problems, we developed an integrated platform for high throughput proteome quantification with combination of on-line low miss-cleavage protein digestion by an ultra-performance immobilized enzymatic reactor, on-line dimethyl labeling onto a C18 precolumn, peptide separation by two-dimensional nano liquid chromatography and MS detection. Compared to traditional off-line method, such a platform exhibits obvious advantages such as high sensitivity, throughput, accuracy, precision and ease of automation. All these results demonstrated that such a platform might become a promising technique for the quantitative proteome analysis. (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB We propose the use of water-based alkyl ketene dimer (AKD) ink for fast and user-friendly patterning of paper microfluidic devices either manually or using an inexpensive XY-plotter. The ink was produced by dissolving hydrophobic AKD in chloroform and emulsifying the solution in water. The emulsification was performed in a warm water bath, which led to an increased rate of the evaporation of chloroform. Subsequent cooling led to the final product, an aqueous suspension of fine AKD particles. The effects of surfactant and AKD concentrations, emulsification procedure, and cooling approach on final ink properties are presented, along with an optimized protocol for its formulation. This hydrophobic agent was applied onto paper using a plotter pen, after which the paper was heated to allow spreading of AKD molecules and chemical bonding with cellulose. A paper surface patterned with the ink (10 g L-1 AKD) yielded a contact angle of 135.6 degrees for water. Unlike organic solvent-based solutions of AKD, this AKD ink does not require a fume hood for its use. Moreover, it is compatible with plastic patterning tools, due to the effective removal of chloroform in the production process to less than 2% of the total volume. Furthermore, this water-based ink is easy to prepare and use. Finally, the AKD ink can also be used for the fabrication of so-called selectively permeable barriers for use in paper microfluidic networks. These are barriers that stop the flow of water through paper, but are permeable to solvents with lower surface energies. We applied the AKD ink to confine and preconcentrate sample on paper, and demonstrated the use of this approach to achieve higher detection sensitivities in paper spray ionization-mass spectrometry (PSI-MS). Our patterning approach can be employed outside of the analytical lab or machine workshop for fast prototyping and small-scale production of paper-based analytical tools, for use in limited-resource labs or in the field.

AB Using Deterministic Lateral Displacement devices optimized for sensitivity to particle length, we separate subpopulations of bacteria depending on known properties that affect their capability to cause disease (virulence). For the human bacterial pathogen Streptococcus pneumoniae, bacterial chain length and the presence of a capsule are known virulence factors contributing to its ability to cause severe disease. Separation of cultured pneumococci into subpopulations based on morphological type (single cocci, diplococci and chains) will enable more detailed studies of the role they play in virulence. Moreover, we present separation of mixed populations of almost genetically identical encapsulated and non-encapsulated pneumococcal strains in our device. (c) 2017 The Authors.

TI Resolution improvement of 3D stereo-lithography through the direct laser
   trajectory programming: Application to microfluidic deterministic
   lateral displacement device
SO ANALYTICA CHIMICA ACTA
LA English

DE 3D stereo-lithography; Deterministic lateral displacement; Microfluidics
ID PERFORMANCE
AB The vast majority of current microfluidic devices are produced using soft lithography, a technique with strong limitations regarding the fabrication of three-dimensional architectures. Additive manufacturing holds great promises to overcome these limitations, but conventional machines still lack the resolution required by most microfluidic applications. 3D printing machines based on two-photon lasers, in contrast, have the needed resolution but are too limited in speed and size of the global device. Here we demonstrate how the resolution of conventional stereolithographic machines can be improved by a direct programming of the laser path and can contribute to bridge the gap between the two above technologies, allowing the direct printing of features between 10 and 100 mm, corresponding to a large fraction of microfluidic applications. This strategy allows to achieve resolutions limited only by the physical size of the laser beam, decreasing by a factor at least 2x the size of the smallest features printable, and increasing their reproducibility by a factor 5. The approach was applied to produce an open microfluidic device with the reversible seal, integrating periodical patterns using the simple motifs, and validated by the fabrication of a deterministic lateral displacement particles sorting device. The sorting of polystyrene beads (diameter: 20 mm and 45 mm) was achieved with a specificity >95%, comparable with that achieved with arrays prepared by microlithography. (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB Cancer cells display acoustic properties enabling acoustophoretic separation from white blood cells (WBCs) with 2-3 log suppression of the WBC background. However, a subset of WBCs has overlapping acoustic properties with cancer cells, which is why label-free acoustophoretic cancer cell isolation needs additional purification prior to analysis. This paper reports for the first time a proof of concept for continuous flow acoustophoretic negative selection of WBCs from cancer cells using negative acoustic contrast elastomeric particles (EPs) activated with CD45-antibodies that specifically bind to WBCs. The EP/WBC complexes align at the acoustic pressure anti-nodes along the channel walls while unbound cancer cells focus to the pressure node in the channel center, enabling continuous flow based depletion of WBC background in a cancer cell product. The method does not provide a single process solution for the CTC separation challenge, but provides an elegant part to a multi-step process by further reducing the WBC background in cancer cell separation products derived from an initial step of label-free acoustophoresis. We report the recorded performance of the negative selection immuno-acoustophoretic WBC depletion and cancer cell recovery. To eliminate the negative impact of the separation due to the known problems of aggregation of negative acoustic contrast particles along the sidewalls of the acoustophoresis channel and to enable continuous separation of EP/WBC complexes from cancer cells, a new acoustic actuation method has been implemented where the ultrasound frequency is scanned (1.991MHz +/- 100 kHz, scan rate 200 kHz ms(-1)). Using this frequency scanning strategy EP/WBC complexes were acoustophoretically separated from mixtures of WBCs spiked with breast and prostate cancer cells (DU145 and MCF-7). An 86-fold (MCF-7) and 52-fold (DU145) reduction of WBCs in the cancer cell fractions were recorded with separation efficiencies of 98.6% (MCF-7) and 99.7% (DU145) and cancer cell recoveries of 89.8% (MCF-7) and 85.0% (DU145).

AB The development of a novel flexible and ultrasensitive aptasensor based on carboxylated multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs)/ reduced graphene oxide-based field effect transistor (FET) has been reported for label-free detection of the ovarian cancer antigen (CA125). The fabricated sensor has a straightforward design based on the noncovalent attachment of MWCNTs/aptamer conjugated onto few layers reduced graphene oxide nanosheets and its integration with poly-methyl methacrylate (PMMA) as a suitable platform for designing flexible field-effect transistors. The surface properties of the aptasensor were characterized using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM). Under optimal conditions, the proposed aptasensor exhibited a wide linear dynamic range for CA125 (1.0 x 10 x(-9)-1.0 U/mL) with a low detection limit of 5.0 x 10 x(-10) U/mL. The proposed aptasensor was also successfully applied to detect CA125 in real human serum samples. Furthermore, sensor flexibility is also a challenging area in chemical and biological sensors, especially for portable, wearable, or even implantable sensors, so, the reduced graphene oxide-based FET-type aptasensor showed bendable flexibility on the PMMA substrate. In addition, the aptasensor exhibited high sensitivity, selectivity, stability and reproducibility which offers great promise as a high performance and flexible FET-type aptasensor to detect CA125 and other cancer biomarkers in clinical samples and biological fluids.

AB For more than two decades, mass spectrometry has been a central technology for proteomics research. During this time, the use of chemical reactions to introduce tags for quantification, affinity enrichment and other uses has facilitated the comprehensive profiling of the proteome by mass spectrometry in many ways. In the last decade, the introduction of more powerful instruments and more sophisticated data acquisition and data analysis routines has made some strategies obsolete, while making other approaches practically feasible only now. Here, the current status of chemical tagging strategies in proteomics is reviewed, with a particular emphasis on proteome quantification workflows, strategies for the enrichment of (post-translationally) modified proteins and peptides, and methods for structural proteomics.

   MODEL; DIFFERENT VALIDATION CRITERIA
AB With an enormous growth in the application of hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC), there has also been significant progress in HILIC method development. HILIC is a chromatographic method that utilises hydro-organic mobile phases with a high organic content, and a hydrophilic stationary phase. It has been applied predominantly in the determination of small polar compounds. Theoretical studies in computer-aided modelling tools, most importantly the predictive, quantitative structure retention relationship (QSRR) modelling methods, have attracted the attention of researchers and these approaches greatly assist the method development process. This review focuses on the application of computer-aided modelling tools in understanding the retention mechanism, the classification of HILIC stationary phases, prediction of retention times in HILIC systems, optimisation of chromatographic conditions, and description of the interaction effects of the chromatographic factors in HILIC separations. Additionally, what has been achieved in the potential application of QSRR methodology in combination with experimental design philosophy in the optimisation of chromatographic separation conditions in the HILIC method development process is communicated. Developing robust predictive QSRR models will undoubtedly facilitate more application of this chromatographic mode in a broader variety of research areas, significantly minimising cost and time of the experimental work.

AB The present review focus on the analytical platforms and the workflow for toxicometabolomics with a special emphasis on their strengths and pitfalls presenting as a case study the toxicometabolomics of arsenic in mammals.
   Although powerful analytical methods and techniques are currently available for metabolomics, the main "bottleneck" is still the absence of unified protocols for sample preparation (e.g. quenching, solvents used) as well as several important factors in toxicometabolomics, which drastically affect the metabolism (e.g. selection of model organisms, xenobiotic doses, chemical form of the xenobiotic, exposure route, biological sample). In this context, the applicability to complex samples, higher sensitivity, specificity and the possibility to perform quantitative analysis offered by MS is crucial to probe xenobiotic induced metabolic changes to evaluate the stress responses.
   Nowadays, the use of different metabolomic platforms allowed determining important changes in the metabolism induced by arsenic in mammals such as alterations in the energy (e.g. Glycolysis, Kreb's cycle), amino acid, lipid, nucleotide and androgen metabolisms.

AB Lead-210 (Pb-210) can be present at high activity concentrations, in residues arising from the petroleum, mineral processing and chemical industries. Although Pb-210 itself poses a low radiological risk, the nuclide decays via Bi-210 to the alpha emitting and highly radiotoxic Po-210. Therefore, rapid, accurate determination of Pb-210 is essential for assessing the radiological risk to plant operators and appropriate sentencing of waste. Unfortunately, direct measurement of Pb-210 by gamma spectrometry is hindered by its weak gamma-ray emission at 46.5 keV, which is readily attenuated by mineral matrices. This paper demonstrates the extent to which Pb-210 can be underestimated during routine analysis by an inter-laboratory exercise involving five accredited laboratories and a wide range of scales from diverse industrial sources. Two methods of addressing errors in Pb-210 analysis are highlighted; the first, involving lithium tetraborate fusion prior to gamma spectrometry shows promise but is not suitable for all Pb-210-containing phases. The second method, requiring calculation of matrix attenuation factors for a representative fingerprint sample, was applied successfully to deposits from the steel and gas industries. However, its wider application depends on detailed chemical and mineralogical characterisation for each of the major categories of mineral scale found and at present, there is an acute lack of suitable certified reference materials.

AB Electrothermal atomic absorption spectrometry (ETAAS) was applied to investigate the atomization behaviors of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) and silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) in order to relate with particle size information. At various atomization temperatures from 1400 degrees C to 2200 degrees C, the time-dependent atomic absorption peak profiles of AuNPs and AgNPs with varying sizes from 5 nm to 100 nm were examined. With increasing particle size, the maximum absorbance was observed at the longer time. The time at maximum absorbance was found to linearly increase with increasing particle size, suggesting that ETAAS can be applied to provide the size information of nanoparticles. With the atomization temperature of 1600 degrees C, the mixtures of nanoparticles containing two particle sizes, i.e., 5 nm tannic stabilized AuNPs with 60, 80, 100 nm citrate stabilized AuNPs, were investigated and bimodal peaks were observed. The particle size dependent atomization behaviors of nanoparticles show potential application of ETAAS for providing size information of nanoparticles. The calibration plot between the time at maximum absorbance and the particle size was applied to estimate the particle size of in-house synthesized AuNPs and AgNPs and the results obtained were in good agreement with those from flow field-flow fractionation (FlFFF) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) techniques. Furthermore, the linear relationship between the activation energy and the particle size was observed. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A rapid method with enhanced U-238 decontamination was developed for ultra-trace Pu analysis in small-volume urine bioassays. This method consists of acid digestion, co-precipitation, extraction chromatography and sector-field inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (SF-ICP-MS) measurement. Parameters that may influence the analytical performance were studied systematically. This method achieved a high U-238 decontamination factor (3.8 x 10(6)) and the Pu-242 recovery was stable for 20 mL and 100mL urine bioassays with an average value of 72.7 +/- 5.5%. The limits of detection for Pu-239, Pu-240 and Pu-241 by the method were 0.016 fg mL(-1), 0.016 fg mL(-1) and 0.019 fg mL(-1) for 20 mL urine samples and 0.003 fg mL(-1), 0.002 fg mL(-1) and 0.003 fg mL(-1) for 100mL urine samples, respectively. Considering the small volume of urine employed in this study, the absolute detection limits of the method were comparable or even better than those measured with thermal ionization mass spectrometry and accelerator mass spectrometry. All procedures for 20 mL and 100 mL urine bioassays were completed in 9.5 h and 11 h, respectively, and analysis of 10 samples could be finished within one day. With the considerably low detection limits of Pu isotopes and high sample throughput, this method would be a promising tool for the quick response to radiological emergencies and for rapid screening of unexpected occupational exposures of workers involved in the future FDNPP reactor decommissioning operations.

AB Advanced materials such as complex metal oxides are used in a wide range of applications and have further promising perspectives in the form of thin films. The exact chemical composition essentially influences the electronic properties of these materials which makes correct assessment of their composition necessary. However, due to high chemical resistance and in the case of thin films low absolute analyte amounts, this procedure is in most cases not straightforward and extremely time-demanding. Commonly applied techniques either lack in ease of use (i.e., solution-based analysis with preceding sample dissolution), or adequately accurate quantification (i.e., solid sampling techniques).
   An analysis approach which combines the beneficial aspects of solution-based analysis as well as direct solid sampling is Laser Ablation of a Sample in Liquid (LASIL). In this work, it is shown that the analysis of major as well as minor sample constituents is possible using a novel online-LASIL setup, allowing sample analysis without manual sample handling after placing it in an ablation chamber. Strontium titanate (STO) thin layers with different compositions were analyzed in the course of this study. Precision of the newly developed online-LASIL method is comparable to conventional wet chemical approaches. With only about 15-20 min required for the analysis per sample, time demand is significantly reduced compared to often necessary fusion procedures lasting multiple hours. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB The use of sparseness in chemometrics is a concept that has increased in popularity. The advantage is, above all, a better interpretability of the results obtained. In this work, sparseness is implemented as a constraint in multivariate curve resolution - alternating least squares (MCR-ALS), which aims at reproducing raw (mixed) data by a bilinear model of chemically meaningful profiles. In many cases, the mixed raw data analyzed are not sparse by nature, but their decomposition profiles can be, as it is the case in some instrumental responses, such as mass spectra, or in concentration profiles linked to scattered distribution maps of powdered samples in hyperspectral images. To induce sparseness in the constrained profiles, one-dimensional and/or two-dimensional numerical arrays can be fitted using a basis of Gaussian functions with a penalty on the coefficients. In this work, a least squares regression framework with L-0-norm penalty is applied. This L-0-norm penalty constrains the number of non-null coefficients in the fit of the array constrained without having an a priori on the number and their positions. It has been shown that the sparseness constraint induces the suppression of values linked to uninformative channels and noise in MS spectra and improves the location of scattered compounds in distribution maps, resulting in a better interpretability of the constrained profiles. An additional benefit of the sparseness constraint is a lower ambiguity in the bilinear model, since the major presence of null coefficients in the constrained profiles also helps to limit the solutions for the profiles in the counterpart matrix of the MCR bilinear model.

AB Anisotropy resolved multidimensional emission spectroscopy (ARMES) provides valuable insights into multi-fluorophore systems like proteins that have complex overlapping emission bands. The method combines multidimensional fluorescence, anisotropy, and chemometrics to facilitate the differentiation of fluorophores with very similar emission properties. Here, we address the critical issue of standardizing the chemometric methods required to accurately extract spectral and anisotropy information from fluorophore mixtures using two standard sample sets: perylene in glycerol, and a mixture of Erythrosin B and Phloxine B with overlapping emission but different anisotropies. We show for the first time how to accurately model component anisotropy using Multivariate Curve Resolution (MCR) from data collected using total synchronous fluorescence scan (TSFS) and Excitation Emission Matrix (EEM) measurement methods.
   These datasets were selected to avoid the presence of inner filter effects (IFE) or Forster resonance energy transfer (FRET) that would depolarize fluorescence emission or reduce data tri-linearity. This allowed the non-trilinear TSFS data to yield accurate component anisotropy data once modelled using the correct data augmentation strategy, however, the EEM data proved to be more accurate once optimal constraints (non-negativity and correspondence among species) were employed. For perylene (S-2) and Phloxine B which both have very weak anisotropy (<0.06), while the spectral recovery was excellent, the modelled anisotropy values were reasonably accurate (+/- 20% of the real value) because of large relative noise contributions. However, for perylene (S-1) and Erythrosin B which have large (>0.2) anisotropies, bilinear and trilinear EEM models built using a total tri-linearity constraint, yielded solutions without any rotational ambiguities and very accurate (+/- 4% of real value) anisotropy values. These sample systems thus provide simple and robust test systems for validating the spectral measurement and chemometric data analysis elements of ARMES. (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This article describes the development and validation of an analytical procedure for the matrix separation, preconcentration and determination of sub-ng kg(-1) levels Th-232 in a small volume (20 mL) of seawater samples. The matrix separation and Th preconcentration was carried out using a commercially available ion-chelation system seaFAST-pico. The acidified to pH < 2 seawater samples were mixed online with the ammonium acetate buffer (pH of 6.0 +/- 0.2) before loading on the column containing resin with iminodiacetic and ethylenediaminetriacetic functional groups. At this pH, Th-232 was quantitatively retained on the resin, demonstrating a good affinity (selectivity) for Th in seawater matrix. The element retained on the resin was eluted using only 0.2 mL of 1.8 M HNO3 enabling to achieve high preconcentration factor. The pretreatment procedure, with two sample loading cycles (each one 10 mL), was accomplished in about 25 min. Determining Th-232 mass fraction in seawater samples was based on isotope dilution inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ID ICP-MS) method, which was considered as the most accurate calibration strategy for precise quantification of Th-232 mass fraction in seawater samples. ISO/IEC17025 and Eurachem guidelines were followed to perform the validation of the developed in this study procedure. In the case of seawater samples with natural level of thorium the major contributions to the expanded uncertainty arose from the uncertainty associated with isotopic ratio measurements in the isotopically spiked sample, followed by the correction for procedural blank and the correction for mass discrimination effect. The estimated method detection limit for Th-232 was 0.005 ng kg(-1). The developed method was successfully applied to the determination of Th-232 mass fraction in seawater reference samples: IAEA-443, SLEW-3, NASS-4, NASS-6, and CASS-5. Although Th-232 is not certified in any of the seawater reference materials, a good agreement was obtained between the results in this study and data published elsewhere. (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB The lab-on-a-chip (LOC) field has witnessed an excess of new technology concepts, especially for the point-of-care (POC) applications. However, only few concepts reached the POC market often because of challenging integration with pumping and detection systems as well as with complex biological assays. Recently, a new technology termed SIMPLE was introduced as a promising POC platform due to its features of being self-powered, autonomous in liquid manipulations, cost-effective and amenable to mass production. In this paper, we improved the SIMPLE design and fabrication and demonstrated for the first time that the SIMPLE platform can be successfully integrated with biological assays by quantifying creatinine, biomarker for chronic kidney disease, in plasma samples. To validate the robustness of the SIMPLE technology, we integrated a SIMPLE-based microfluidic cartridge with colorimetric read-out system into the benchtop Creasensor. This allowed us to perform on-field validation of the Creasensor in a single-blind study with 16 plasma samples, showing excellent agreement between measured and spiked creatinine concentrations (ICC: 0.97). Moreover, the range of clinically relevant concentrations (0.76-20 mg/dL), the sample volume (5 mL) and time-to-result of only 5 min matched the Creasensor performance with both lab based and POC benchmark technologies. This study demonstrated for the first time outstanding robustness of the SIMPLE in supporting the implementation of biological assays. The SIMPLE flexibility in liquid manipulation and compatibility with different sample matrices opens up numerous opportunities for implementing more complex assays and expanding its POC applications portfolio.

AB Hematocrit (HCT) measurements of blood from patients, blood donors and athletes are routinely performed on a daily basis. These measurements are often performed in centralized hospital labs by whole blood analyzers, which leads to long time-to-result. On site measurements, based on centrifugation can be done, but these assays require manual handling, are slow and can just measure HCT in contrast to the central lab whole blood analyzers. In this work, we present a microfluidic based method to measure HCT in blood samples by acoustic separation of whole blood into discrete regions of plasma and red blood cells. Comparison of the areas of the red blood cell and plasma regions gives an accurate HCT value, with a linear correlation to the centrifugation-based reference method. A readout can be performed within 2 s of acoustic actuation providing a readout accuracy of approximately 3% points (pp) HCT. Additional accuracy can be achieved by extending the acoustic actuation to 20 s, yielding an error of less than 1 pp HCT. This acoustic tool is optimal for integration into a lab-on-a-chip device with in-line measurements of different clinical parameters. (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Communication and drug efficacy in the immune system rely heavily on diffusion of proteins such as cytokines through the tissue matrix. Available methods to analyze diffusion in tissue require microinjection or saturating the tissue in protein, which may alter local transport properties due to damage or rapid cellular responses. Here, we developed a novel, user-friendly method - Microfluidic Integrated Optical Imaging (micro-IOI) - to quantify the effective diffusion coefficient of bioactive proteins in live tissue samples ex vivo. A microfluidic platform was used to deliver picograms of fluorescently labelled cytokines to microscale regions within slices of murine lymph node, and diffusion was monitored by widefield fluorescence microscopy. Micro-IOI was validated against theory and existing methods. Free diffusion coefficients were within 8% and 24% of Stokes-Einstein predictions for dextrans and cytokines, respectively. Furthermore, diffusion coefficients for dextrans and proteins in a model matrix were within 1.5-fold of reported results from fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP). We used micro-IOI to quantify the effective diffusion of three cytokines from different structural classes and two different expression systems - tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), interferon gamma (IFN-gamma), and interleukin-2 (IL-2), from human and mouse - through live lymph node tissue. This is the first method to directly measure cytokine transport in live tissue slices, and in the future, it should promote a deeper understanding of the dynamics of cell-cell communication and enable targeted immunotherapy design.

AB Arrays of microwells are widely used to isolate individual cells, facilitate high throughput cytometry assays, and ensure compatibility of those assays with whole-cell imaging. Microwell geometries have recently been utilized for handling and preparation of single-cell lysate, prior to single-cell protein electrophoresis. It is in the context of single-cell electrophoresis that we investigate the interplay of microwell geometry (circular, rectangular, triangular) and transport (diffusion, electromigration) on the subsequent performance of single-cell polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) for protein targets. We define and measure injector-induced dispersion during PAGE, and develop a numerical model of band broadening sources, experimentally validate the numerical model, and then identify operating conditions (characterized through the Peclet number, Pe) that lead to microwell-geometry induced losses in separation performance. With analysis of mammalian cells as a case study, we sought to understand at what Pe is the PAGE separation performance adversely sensitized to the microwell geometry. In developing design rules, we find that for the microwell geometries that are the most suitable for isolation of mammalian cells and moderate mass protein targets, the Pe is usually small enough (Pe < similar to 20) to mitigate the effect of the microwell geometry on protein PAGE of single-cell lysate. In extreme cases where the largest mammalian cells are analyzed (Pe > similar to 20), consideration of Pe suggests using a rectangular - and not the widely used circular - microwell geometry to maximize protein PAGE separation performance.

AB The patterning of antibodies in microfluidics chips is always a delicate process that is usually done in an open chip before bonding. Typical bonding techniques such as plasma treatment can harm the antibodies with as result that they are removed from our fabrication toolbox. Here we propose a method, based on capillary phenomena using 3D capillary valves, that autonomously and conveniently allows us to pattern liquids inside closed chips. We theoretically analyse the system and demonstrate how our analysis can be used as a design tool for various applications. Chips patterned with the method were used for simple immunodetection of a cardiac biomarker which demonstrates its suitability for antibody patterning. (c) 2017 The Authors.

TI Fabricating smooth PDMS microfluidic channels from low-resolution 3D

ID SURFACES; DEVICES
AB The advent of 3D printing has allowed for rapid bench-top fabrication of molds for casting polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) chips, a widely-used polymer in prototyping microfluidic devices. While fabricating PDMS devices from 3D printed molds is fast and cost-effective, creating smooth surface topology is highly dependent on the printer's quality. To produce smooth PDMS channels from these molds, we propose a novel technique in which a lubricant is tethered to the surface of a 3D printed mold, which results in a smooth interface for casting PDMS. Fabricating the omniphobic-lubricant-infused molds (OLIMs) was accomplished by coating the mold with a fluorinated-silane to produce a high affinity for the lubricant, which tethers it to the mold. PDMS devices cast onto OLIMs produced significantly smoother topology and can be further utilized to fabricate smooth-channeled PDMS devices. Using this method, we reduced the surface roughness of PDMS microfluidic channels from 2 to 0.2 mu m (10-fold decrease), as well as demonstrated proper operation of the fabricated devices with superior optical properties compared to the rough devices. Furthermore, a COMSOL simulation was performed to investigate how the distinct surface topographies compare regarding their volumetric velocity profile and the shear rate produced. Simulation results showed that, near the channel's surface, variations in flow regime and shear stress is significantly reduced for the microfluidic channels cast on OLIM compared to the ones cast on uncoated 3D printed molds. The proposed fabrication method produces high surface-quality microfluidic devices, comparable to the ones cast on photolithographically fabricated molds while eliminating its costly and time-consuming fabrication process.

AB In the present work, colloidal cerium oxide nanoparticles (nanoceria) and graphene quantum dots (GQDs) were firstly synthesized by sol-gel method and pyrolysis respectively, which all have a uniform nano-size and significant fluorescence emission. Due to the fluorescence emission spectrum of nanoceria overlapped the absorption spectrum of GQDs, fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) between nanoceria and GQDs could occur effectively by the electrostatic interaction. Based on it, a sensitive ratiometric fluorescence aptasensor for the determination of ochratoxin A (OTA), a small molecular mycotoxin produced by Aspergillus and Penicillium strains, has been successfully constructed. In which, probe DNA1@nanoceria and DNA2@GQD were designed to complementary with OTA aptamer, both could adsorb each other, leading to the occur of FRET. After adding of OTA aptamer and then introducing of OTA, the FRET would be interrupted/recovered due to the specific affinity of OTA and its aptamer, the fluorescence recovery value would increase with the addition of OTA. Under the optimal experimental conditions (pH 7, m(GQD/nanoceria) 2, c(aptamer) 100 nM, incubation time 30 min), the constructed ratiometric fluorescence aptasensor exhibited a satisfying linear range (0.01-20 ng mL(-1)), low limit of detection (2.5 pg mL(-1)) and good selectivity towards OTA, and has been successfully applied for the analysis of real sample peanuts with good accuracy of the recoveries ranged from 90 to 110%.

AB The application of electrophoresis upon commercial threads is investigated for development of low-cost diagnostics assays, designed for the matrix separation and quantification of low abundance metabolites in complex samples - in this work riboflavin in human urine. Zone electrophoresis was evaluated upon 8 commercially available threads, with several synthetic threads exhibiting higher electroosmotic flow (EOF) and increased electrophoretic mobility of the rhodamine 6G, rhodamine B, and fluorescein. Of those tested, a nylon bundle was selected as the best platform, offering less band dispersion and higher resolution, a high relative EOF, whilst minimising the contribution of joule heating. A novel 3D printed platform was designed, based on a modular system, facilitating the electrophoresis process and rapid assembly, whilst offering the potential for multiplexed analysis or investigation of more complex systems. Using the thread-based electrophoresis system, riboflavin was determined in less than 2 min. The device exhibited a linear working range from 0.1 to 15 mu g/mL of riboflavin in urine, and was in good agreement with capillary electrophoresis measurements. (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB The fundamental relationships between the structure and chemistry of latex nanoparticles synthesized by reversible addition fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) controlled living polymerization and their subsequent performance as pseudostationary phases (PSP) are reported in this paper. RAFT enables the rational optimization of latex nanoparticle pseudostationary phases and control of the behavior of the PSP. Nanoparticles comprised of amphiphilic diblock copolymers of 2-acrylamido-2-methylpropane sulfonic acid-derived ionic/hydrophilic blocks and butyl-ethyl-or methyl-acrylate-derived hydrophobic blocks were synthesized in two sizes. The mobility, methylene selectivity, and efficiency of each of the six pseudostationary phases are reported, as well as the relationship between monomer quantity and NP size. Linear solvation energy relationships are reported and compared to SDS micelles and previous nanoparticle pseudostationary phases. The solvation characteristics and selectivity of nanoparticle pseudostationary phases is shown to be affected primarily by the structure of the hydrophobic copolymer block. Butyl acrylate nanoparticles 17 nm in diameter are found to provide the best overall separation performance with over 500 thousand theoretical plates generated in 6 min separations.

AB An evaporative membrane modulator was developed, built and evaluated to avoid loss of performance in the second dimension when coupling two-dimensional liquid chromatography systems. The automated interface reduces the volume after D-1 elution on-line by a pre-determined factor, regardless of the separation gradient. This volume reduction ensures that the injection volume in the D-2 is appropriate for the second column, avoiding the detrimental effects of overloading. In addition, the fraction solvent composition is constant over the length of the separation increasing reproducibility of D-2 separations. The evaporative membrane modulator was demonstrated with a 10-fold reduction, reducing the injection volume from 50 to 5 mu L. A consequence of the EMM device is a reduction in the capacity of the first dimension, which is decreased by a factor of 2.4, but the peak width at half maximumwas reduced by up to 22% in the second dimension. When band broadening is considered, the corrected peak capacity with the modulator was only 10% lower than that without the modulator, but with a gain in peak height of 2 -3, and a decrease in retention time between subsequent peak-slices reduced from 4s to be negligible. This improves peak shape and shows potential to facilitate peak identification and quantification in more complex applications. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Inner filter effect (IFE) was previously considered as an error in fluorescence measurement. In recent years, it has been developed as an important non-irradiation energy conversion model of spectroscopic technique and found wide applications in the fields of chemical sensing and biosensing. In comparison with traditional techniques based on forster resonance energy transfer (FRET), the IFE-based fluorescent approach is more flexible and straightforward without the link of absorber with fluorescer. The present review for the first time introduces the state of the art in the progress of the IFE-based fluorescent sensing systems, including sensing strategy, essential conditions, materials option, and their applications for the detection of various target analytes, e.g., ionic species, small molecules, and macromolecules. In addition, the benefits and limitations of the IFE-based fluorescent sensing systems are also critically discussed and highlighted. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This tutorial discusses continuous electromembrane extraction (c-EME) coupled directly to mass spectrometry (MS), and the applicability of such systems for on-line and real-time monitoring of in-vitro drug metabolism. Parent drug substances and corresponding drug metabolites are extracted from the metabolic reaction mixture, through a supported liquid membrane (SLM), and into an acceptor solution on the other side. Extraction is accomplished using an external electrical field sustained over the SLM. The acceptor solution is continuously pumped into the mass spectrometer, and the decline of parent drug as well as the development of metabolites is followed directly with the mass spectrometer. The purpose of the extraction is to avoid proteins and salts from the reaction mixture from entering the mass spectrometer. This tutorial first discusses the principles and theory of operation. Second, technical development is highlighted with special focus on major challenges associated with c-EME-MS systems. Third, operational parameters and performance are discussed, and finally future perspectives and challenges are considered. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Theophylline is a common bronchodilator for the treatment of diseases like asthma, bronchitis and emphysema. However, it should be strictly used and monitored due to its toxicity when the concentration is above certain levels. In this work, an electrochemical biosensor for theophylline detection is proposed by recognition of RNA aptamer and gold nanoparticle (AuNP)-based amplification technique. First, RNA aptamer is splitted into two single-stranded RNA probes. One is hybridized with DNA tetrahedron and the resulted nanostructure is then immobilized onto a gold electrode; the other is modified on the surface of AuNPs which is also labeled with methylene blue (MB) as electrochemical species. The recognition process between the two RNA probes and theophylline causes the localization of AuNPs and the enrichment of MB on the electrode interface. A significant electrochemical response is thus generated which is related to the concentration of initial theophylline. This proposed aptasensor shows excellent sensitivity and selectivity which could also be applied in quantitatively detection of theophylline in serums samples. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB Coated Blade Spray (CBS) is a technology that efficiently integrates sample preparation and direct coupling to mass spectrometry (MS) on a single device. In this article, we present CBS-tandem mass spectrometry (CBS-MS/MS) as a novel tool for the rapid and simultaneous determination of four commonly used immunosuppressive drugs (ISDs) in whole blood: tacrolimus (TAC) and cyclosporine-A (CycA), which are calcineurin inhibitors; and sirolimus (SIR) and everolimus (EVR), which are both mTOR (mechanistic target of rapamycin) inhibitors. Given that CBS extracts via free concentration, analytes that are largely bound to plasma proteins or red blood cells provide considerably lower extraction recovery rates. Therefore, we defy the solventless philosophy of SPME-based techniques, like CBS, by performing the analyte-enrichment step via direct immersion in a solvent-modified matrix. The assay was linear within the evaluated range of concentrations (between 1 and 100 ng/mL for EVR/SIR/TAC and 10-1000 ng/mL for CycA), and the limits of quantification were determined to be 10 ng/mL for CycA and 1 ng/mL for EVR/SIR/TAC. Good accuracy (87-119%) and linearity (r(2) >= 0.99) were attained over the evaluated range for all ISDs. Interassay imprecision (CV) determined from incurred sample reanalysis was <= 10% for all ISDs. Our method was validated using Liquichek (TM) whole blood immunosuppressant quality control (QC) standards purchased from Bio-Rad. Concentrations determined by CBS-MS/MS were inside the range specified by Bio-Rad and within 15% of the expected mean value for all ISDs at all QC levels. Furthermore, the effect of different hematocrit levels (20,45, and 70%) in the entire calibration range was carefully studied. No statistical differences (RSD <= 7%) in the calibration curve slopes of ISDs in blood were observed. CBS offers a simpler workflow than that of traditional methods; it eliminates the need for chromatographic separation and provides a clean extract that allows for long-term MS instrumental operation with minimal maintenance. Additionally, because CBS integrates all analytical steps into one device, it eliminates the risk of instrumental carry-over and can be used as a low-cost disposable device for sample preparation and analysis. Fully-automated sample preparation simplifies the method and allows for total analysis times as short as 3 min with turn-around times of less than 90 min. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) represent a group of synthetic chemicals, and they have quite different physicochemical properties, which result in difficulties of their simultaneous determination in a single injection. A sensitive, reliable, and fully automated method was developed for simultaneously detecting 10 classes of PFASs (total of 43) in human serum using online Turboflow SPE-UHPLC-MS/MS. This method provided high linearity of matrix-matched calibration standards (R > 0.99), excellent method limits of detection (MLODs) (0.013-0.089 ng mL(-1)). satisfactory matrix spiked recoveries (84.3-109%) and relative standard deviations (RSDs) (intra-day RSDs: 1.3-12.6%, inter-day RSDs: 1.7-13.8%, inter-week RSDs: 1.8-13.5%, inter-month RSDs: 3.1-12.4%), short analysis time (19 min per sample) and small sample amount requirement (25 mu L), which were suitable for large-scale epidemiologic studies. Moreover, the method provided the feasibility of real-time monitoring for the degradation kinetics of PFASs precursors both in vitro and in vivo. The quality of the present method was further verified by repetitive analysis of a standard reference material (SRM 1957), with the deviations of the targeted PFAS concentrations ranging from 1.9% to 14.2% (n = 5) between the detected and reference values. The present study also determined values for several PFASs in SRM 1957 other than those on the certificate, for the first time, such as N-EtFOSA, 6:2 Cl-PFESA, and PFBA. Finally, the established method was applied to detect PFASs in serum samples of 15 ordinary people and 15 occupational workers, and 6:2 FTSA was found as the dominant precursor.

AB The present study assessed the suitability of using QuEChERS procedure for the simultaneous determination and quantification of 37 multi-class pesticides in human hair. Matrix co-eluted material had a large influence on instrumental response sensitivity. Purification was needed although dSPE cleanup sorbent selection critically influenced analyte recovery. Optimized protocol using Z-Sep+ sorbent successfully achieved recovery of 28 pesticides with high sensitivity, precision, and accuracy. Limits of detection ranged from 0.2 to 86.6 pg mg(-1) and from 0.5 to 6.3 pg mg(-1) for GC and UPLC amenable substances respectively. Pyrethroid pesticides were the most influenced by matrix effects which explained the higher limits of quantification retained for these substances. On the contrary, high sensitivity was achieved for UPLC amenable substances (LOD < 1 pg mg(-1) for atrazine, deisopropylatrazine, desethylatrazine, and imidacloprid). Suitability for monitoring pesticide exposure was assessed by application of the proposed protocol to samples collected on the field. Hairs of the volunteers were found positive to 8 pesticides with every sample containing at least one residue. Among these pesticides, only 3 were reported as used in local vegetable production, which suggested other sources of exposure. The developed method offers a sensitive, robust, and accessible tool for biomonitoring of human exposure. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Rapid differentiation of the Ganoderma species that are officially stated in the Chinese pharm acopoeia from easily confused Ganoderma species could be achieved based on this method, as the acquired DI-MS spectra showed that ganoderic acids, the major active components of Ganoderma, could be found only in the official Ganoderma species but not in the confused Ganoderma species. In addition, classification of wild and cultivated Ganoderma and potential differentiation of Ganoderma from different geographical locations could be accomplished based on principal component analysis (PCA) or hierarchical clustering analysis (HCA). The method is rapid, simple and reproducible, and can be further extended to analysis of other herbal medicines. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A simple and highly sensitive immunoassay based on a competitive binding and bio-barcode amplification was designed for detection of small molecules, triazophos. The gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) were modified with monoclonal antibodies and 6-carboxyfiuorescein labeled single-stranded thiol-oligonucleotides (6-FAM-SH-ssDNAs); the fluorescence of 6-FAM was quenched by AuNPs. Ovalbumin-linked haptens were coated on the bottom of microplate to compete with the triazophos in the sample for binding to the antibodies on the AuNP probes. The fluorescence intensity was inversely proportional to analyte concentration. Parameters of AuNP probes preparation and immune reaction were optimized. At the optimal conditions, the salting process was shortened to 1 h and 166 +/- 9 ssDNAs were loaded onto a single AuNP. The competitive fluorescence bio-barcode immunoassay was performed on water, rice, cucumber, cabbage and apple samples. The linear range of the method was 0.01-20 mu g L-1 and the limit of detection (LOD) was 6 ng L-1. The recovery and relative standard deviations (RSDs) ranged from 85.0 to 110.3% and 9.4-17.4%, respectively. Good correlations were obtained between the results of the developed method and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). In conclusion, it is suggested that the competitive fluorescent bio-barcode immunoassay had the potential to be used as a sensitive method for detection of a variety of small molecules in various samples.

AB Porous organic molecular cages, as a new type of porous materials, have in recent years attracted a tremendous amount of attention for their potential applications. However, to the best of our knowledge, there has been no attempt to utilize porous organic molecular cages as stationary phases in capillary electrochromatography (CEC). We report herein the use of a homochiral porous organic cage (POC) (CC3-R) as a stationary phase in open tubular capillary electrochromatography (OT-CEC) for the separation of chiral compounds and positional isomers. The column was fabricated using CC3-R as the stationary phase by a static coating method. Separation of furoin, benzoin, and alprenlol were achieved on the CC3-R coated column, with the highest resolution value (R-s = 3.35) for the separation of benzoin. The influences of pH and buffer concentration on separation have been investigated. Besides, the CC3-R column also exhibited good selectivity for the separation of positional isomers, including those of nitrophenols, phenylenediamines, aminophenols, and ionones. The run-to-run (n = 5), day-to-day (n = 5), column-to-column (n = 3), and batch-to-batch (n = 3) relative standard deviations (RSDs) for the analyte migration time were in the range of 0.5-1.5%, 0.2-1.8%, 1.2-2.1% and 1.5-2.8%, respectively. The RSDs for the migration time and enantioselectivity of the analyte were less than 5.9% and 2.2% (inter-day, n = 5) after a week of continuous use. This work also indicates that porous organic molecular materials are promising for enantioseparation in CEC and look set to become more attractive in separation science. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB Urine and blood samples are the primary matrices for the detection of exogenous substances in doping control and toxicology. Although these matrices are, in general, very suitable for a wide range of substances, they do show some issues in particular cases. Here, alternative matrices may provide an answer.
   In this work, a quantitative method for steroid profiling (5 endogenous steroids and their ratios) in oral fluid was developed and validated. In total, 826 saliva samples were analyzed, and inter-individual reference population thresholds for saliva steroid profile parameters were set up. Alterations of this steroid profile after administration of naturally occurring anabolic androgenic steroids (e.g. testosterone (T) or dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA)) were investigated. In addition, intra-individual short and longterm natural fluctuations were investigated. For longitudinal monitoring in oral fluid, steroid profile ratios (e.g., T/DHEA) were superior to absolute concentrations due to lower susceptibility towards the diurnal pattern.
   For the detection of a transdermal application of T, the salivary parameter T/DHEA proved to have the highest sensitivity. In contrast with the current screening procedures in urine, there is no need for an additional expensive and time-consuming isotope ratio mass spectrometry confirmation procedure to unequivocally attribute the elevated parameter to an exogenous origin.

AB Label-free LC-MS(/MS) provides accurate quantitative profiling of proteins and metabolites in complex biological samples such as cell lines, tissues and body fluids. A label-free experiment consists of several LC-MS(/MS) chromatograms that might be acquired over several days, across multiple laboratories using different instruments. Single-stage part (MS1 map) of the LC-MS(/MS) contains quantitative information on all compounds that can be detected by LC-MS(/MS) and is the data of choice used by quantitative LC-MS(/MS) data pre-processing workflows. Differences in experimental conditions and fluctuation of analytical parameters influence the overall quality of the MS1 maps and are factors hampering comparative statistical analyses and data interpretation. The quality of the obtained MS1 maps can be assessed based on changes in the two separation dimensions (retention time, mass-to-charge ratio) and the readout (ion intensity) of MS1 maps. In this tutorial we discuss two types of changes, monotonic and non-monotonic shifts, which may occur in the two separation dimensions and the readout of MS1 map. Monotonic shifts of MS1 maps can be corrected, while non-monotonic ones can only be assessed but not corrected, since correction would require precise modelling of the underlying physicochemical effects, which would require additional parameters and analysis. We discuss reasons for monotonic and non-monotonic shifts in the two separation dimensions and readout of MS1 maps, as well as algorithms that can be used to correct monotonic or to assess the extent non-monotonic shifts. Relation of non-monotonic shift with peak elution order inversion and orthogonality as defined in analytical chemistry is discussed. We aim this tutorial for data generator and evaluators scientists who aim to known the condition and approaches to produce and pre-processed comparable MS1 maps. (C) 2017 The Author(s).

AB A carbon fiber brush electrode (CFBE) was newly designed and used as a substrate for both controlled potential electrolysis and atmospheric solids analysis probe (ASAP) mass spectrometry. Electropolymerized and strongly adsorbed products of electrolysis were directly desorbed and ionized from the electrode surface. Electrochemical properties of the electrode investigated by cyclic voltammetry revealed large electroactive surface area (23 +/- 3 cm(2)) at 1.3 cm long array of carbon fibers with diameter 6-9 mu m. Some products of electrochemical oxidation of pentabromophenol and 2,4,6-tribromophenol formed a compact layer on the carbon fibers and were analyzed using ASAP. Eleven new oligomeric products were identified including quinones and biphenoquinones. These compounds were not observed previously in electrolyzed solutions by liquid or gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. The thickness around 58 nm and 45 nm of the oxidation products layers deposited on carbon fibers during electrolysis of pentabromophenol and 2,4,6-tribromophenol, respectively, was estimated from atomic force microscopy analysis and confirmed by scanning electron microscopy with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy measurements.

AB Superoxide anion (O center dot(-)(2)), as the first generated reactive oxygen species (ROS), has been considered to be highly deleterious to cell functions. The measurement of intracellular O center dot(-)(2) level is of great importance to uncover its roles in a variety of oxidative damage diseases. Hydroethidium (HE) fluorescence-based method is dominating intracellular O center dot(-)(2) assay by monitoring the unique product 2-OH-E+ of HE/O center dot(-)(2) reaction. However, the avoid-less cross-interference of red fluorescence limited its ability to provide trustworthy information on intracellular O center dot(-)(2) formation. By the detection of 2-OH-E+, we herein developed and validated an improved LC/MS-based method for the measurement of intracellular O center dot(-)(2). Firstly, we demonstrated the proportionality of HE/O center dot(-)(2) reaction. Secondly, ungerimine was used as internal standard to eliminate daily basis and matrix effect in the LC/MS-based detection of 2-OH-E+. Afterward, the total protein concentration was utilized for cell number normalization. Accordingly, an equation was further proposed to calculate the relative abundance (RA) of intracellular O center dot(-)(2). Finally, the developed method has been successfully utilized to evaluate the inhibitory effects of natural compounds on O center dot(-)(2) generation, the result of which was validated by the HE-based fluorescent measurement. Compared with the fluorescent measurement, the LC/MS-based intracellular O center dot(-)(2) assay method is more sensitive, selective and accurate. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Despite the significance of membrane proteins (MPs) in biological system is indisputable, their specific natures make them notoriously difficult to be analyzed. Particularly, the widely used Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS) prefers analyses of hydrophilic cytosolic proteins and has a limited ionization efficiency towards hydrophobic MPs. Herein, a hydrophobic compound (E)-propyl alpha-Cyano-4-Hydroxyl Cinnamylate (CHCA-C3), a propyl-esterified derivative of alpha-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (CHCA), was applied as a contaminant tolerant matrix for high sensitivity MALDI-MS analyses of MPs. With CHCA-C3, the detection limits of hydrophobic peptides were 10- to 100-fold better than those using CHCA. Furthermore, high quality of spectra could be achieved in the presence of high concentration of chaotropes, salts and detergents, as well as human urinary and serum environment. Also, CHCA-C3 could generate uniform sample distribution even in the presence of contaminants. This high contaminant-resistance was revealed to be ascribed to the enhanced hydrophobicity of CHCA-C3 with a lower affinity towards hydrophilic contaminants. The application of CHCA-C3 is further demonstrated by the analysis of trypsin/CNBr digests of bacteriorhodopsin containing seven transmembrane domains (TMDs), which dramatically increased numbers of identified hydrophobic peptides in TMDs and sequence coverage (similar to 100%). Besides, a combined method by using CHCA-C3 with fluoride solvent and a patterned paraffin plate was established for analysis of integral MPs. We achieved a low detection limit of 10 fmol for integral bacteriorhodopsin, which could not be detected using traditional matrices such as 3,5-dimethoxy-4-hydroxycinamic acid, 2,5-dihydroxyacetophenone even at sample concentration of 10 pmol.

AB Advances in medical diagnostics and personalized therapy require robust, sensitive yet cost-effective diagnostic tools for rapid measurement of biomolecules including proteins in body fluids. State-of-the-art technologies are complex and rely on expensive or custom made detection system, and therefore, cannot be readily adapted for point-of-care (POC) analysis. The development of a novel detection platform, which leverages horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-mediated silver precipitation within antibody immobilized porosity tuned poly (ethylene) glycol diacrylate (PEGDA) hydrogel microparticles with the operational advantages of suspension arrays for sensitive quantification of biomarkers, is described. In this study, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) has been used as a model protein. The silver deposition corresponded to the concentration of VEGF in solution. The detection limit of 5.2 +/- 1.0 pg/mL and assay time of 2 h highlights that this assay exceeds the conventional technologies in terms of sensitivity and speed. The practical applicability of the hydrogel microparticle based detection system has been established by demonstrating the ability of the system to quantify the production of VEGF by highly aggressive (MDA-MB-231) and non-aggressive (MCF-7) breast cancer cells. The reliance on simple instrument for quantification of clinically relevant markers bolsters the adaptability of the detection platform/method in POC settings. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB A biosensor for mouse Immunoglobulin G (IgG) was generated from responsive polymer-based interference filters (etalons). To accomplish this, an excess amount of alkaline phosphatase-modified goat anti-mouse IgG (AP-GAM, F(ab')(2) fragment specific to mouse IgG) was added to mouse IgG, and allowed to react for some time. After a given reaction time, the bound AP-GAM could be isolated from the unbound, excess AP-GAM by addition of goat anti-mouse IgG (Fc fragment specific)-modified magnetic microspheres (GAM-M) that bind the mouse IgG bound to AP-GAM. After application of a magnetic field, the free, unbound AP-GAM was isolated from the mixture and exposed to an etalon that has its upper Au surface modified with phosphate-containing polymer that can be degraded by AP-GAM. By the phosphate-containing polymer being degraded by the excess AP-GAM, the cleaved phosphate groups can diffuse into the interference filter's active polymer layer that yields a change in the optical properties that can be related to the amount of IgG in the sample. This concept is extremely straightforward to implement, and can be modified to detect a variety of other analytes of interest. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Magnetic beads (MB) and signal amplifiers, such as horseradish peroxidase polymers (poly-HRP), have been used before for the production of highly sensitive immunoassays. However, most of the examples reported previously entailed long and tedious multi-step procedures, which were not necessarily shorter or simpler than classical paths such as Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA). Here, instead of exploiting the combination of MB and poly-HRP to ameliorate sensitivity, we show that they conform a powerful tool that can be used to shorten the incubation times, which allows optimizing extremely simple, fast and efficient immunoassays with minimal technical requirements. In order to do so, here we used the highly sensitive and specific pair of antibodies of a commercial ELISA kit to optimize a magneto-ELISA for the detection of matrix metallopeptidase 9 (MMP-9). Three signal amplifiers were then tested and the best performing one was implemented in the magneto-assay to shorten the incubation times and improve assay performance. As we show, the shortened magneto-assay could be carried out in about 35 min, which included two 5-min incubations, washing, and incubation with enzyme substrate for 20 min before colorimetric detection. Moreover, the quantification of MMP-9 provided by the shortened assay in 12 plasma samples collected from patients was comparable to that generated by the 5-h ELISA, which was 8.5 times longer.

AB We have developed a gold nanoparticle (AuNP)-based CTG repeat probing system displaying high quenching capability and combined it with isothermal amplification for the detection of miRNA 146a. This method of using a AuNP-based CTG repeat probing system with isothermal amplification allowed the highly sensitive (14 aM) and selective detection of miRNA 146a. A AuNP-based CTG repeat probing system having a hairpin structure and a dT(F) fluorophore exhibited highly efficient quenching because the CTG repeat-based stable hairpin structure imposed a dose distance between the AuNP and the dT(F) residue. A small amount of miRNA 146a induced multiple copies of the CAG repeat sequence during rolling circle amplification; the AuNP-based CTG repeat probing system then bound to the complementary multiple-copy CAG repeat sequence, thereby inducing a structural change from a hairpin to a linear structure with amplified fluorescence. This AuNP-based CTG probing system combined with isothermal amplification could also discriminate target miRNA 146a from one- and two-base-mismatched miRNAs (ORN 1 and ORN 2, respectively). This simple AuNP-based CTG probing system, combined with isothermal amplification to induce a highly sensitive change in fluorescence, allows the detection of miRNA 146a with high sensitivity (14 aM) and selectivity.

AB The value of exploring selectivity and solvent strength ternary gradients in enhanced fluidity liquid chromatography (EFLC) is demonstrated for the separation of inulin-type fructans from chicory. Commercial binary pump systems for supercritical fluid chromatography only allow for the implementation of ternary solvent strength gradients which can be restrictive for the separation of polar polymeric analytes. In this work, a custom system was designed to extend the capability of EFLC to allow tuning of selectivity or solvent strength in ternary gradients. Gradient profiles were evaluated using the Berridge function (RF1), normalized resolution product (NRP), and gradient peak capacity (P-c). Selectivity gradients provided the separation of more analytes over time. The RF1 function showed favor to selectivity gradients with comparable P-c to that of solvent strength gradients. NRP did not strongly correlate with P(c )or RF(1 )score. EFLC with the hydrophilic interaction chromatography, HILIC, separation mode was successfully employed to separate up to 47 fructan analytes in less than 25 min using a selectivity gradient.

AB Macroporous, monodisperse PS/DVB particles with diameters of 4.0-4.6 pm were functionalized via free radical graft polymerization to create high performance anion exchangers. Varying the amount of monomer from 0 to 10 mmol per 2.0 g PS/DVB allows a control of the column capacity to create columns with capacities up to 350 mu eq/column for 100 mm columns. No further increase of the capacity is observed when using more than 6 mmol of the monomer due to a rivaling homopolymerization. With increasing capacity, the exchangers showed increasing selectivity factors of Br- and NO3- in reference to Cl from 2.4 to 4.3 and 3.5 to 4.6, changing the elution order in the process. At the same time, contradicting the retention model, the selectivity of SC42- did not change with increasing capacity. Analyzing the amount of converted double bonds during functionalization allowed to identify a grafting-onto mechanism, as the amount of converted double bonds ranges from 0% to 52% depending on the amount of monomer used. This information also allowed the calculation of the average chain length, which ranges from 1 to 6 exchanger groups. The average chain length depends on the amount of monomer used, creating higher average chain lengths with higher amounts of monomer. However, it was not possible to link the observed selectivity differences to the average chain lengths of the columns or the influence of the column capacity on the ion exchange mechanism.

AB In this research, a hydrophilic polymeric monolith containing choline phosphate (CP) was fabricated through the thermally initiated free-radical polymerization of 2-{2-(methacryloyloxy) ethyl-dimethylammonium}ethyl n-butyl phosphate (MBP) with ethylene dimethacrylate (EDMA) using isopropanol and tetrahydrofuran as the porogenic system. Excellent mechanical strength, permeability, stability and reproducibility were obtained on the optimized poly(MBP-co-EDMA) monolith. Column efficiency as high as 107,500 plates/m was achieved for the analysis of thiourea at a flow velocity of 0.2 mm/s on the monolith. Both hydrophilic and electrostatic interactions were observed for the retention of charged analytes on the poly(MBP-co-EDMA) monolith. It is worth noting that the resulting monolith exhibits higher selectivity and efficiency than the classical 2-(methacryloyloxy)ethyl phosphorylcholine functionalized polymeric monolith for the chromatographic separation of polar analytes. Also, the novel monolithic column was successfully applied to enrich N-glycopeptides from tryptic digest of human IgG. In a word, the versatile MBP functionalized polymeric monolith not only opens up interesting possibilities for reverse zwitterionic CP derivative-based polymeric materials in separation science, but also represents a promising hydrophilic interaction chromatography stationary phase.

AB Bisphenols (BPs) are well known endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) that cause adverse effects on the environment, biotic life and human health. BPs have been studied extensively because of an increasing concern for the safety of the environment and for human health. They are major raw materials for manufacturing polycarbonates, thermal papers and epoxy resins and are considered hazardous environmental contaminants. A vast array of sensors and biosensors have been developed for the sensitive screening of BPs based on carbon nanomaterials (carbon nanotubes, fullerenes, graphene and graphene oxide), quantum dots, metal and metal oxide nanocomposites, polymer nanocomposites, metal organic frameworks, ionic liquids and molecularly imprinted polymers. This review is devoted mainly to a variety of sensitive, selective and reliable sensing and biosensing methods for the detection of BPs using electrochemistry, fluorescence, colorimetry, surface plasmon resonance, luminescence, ELISAs, circular dichroism, resonance Rayleigh scattering and adsorption techniques in plastic products, food samples, food packaging, industrial wastes, pharmaceutical products, human body fluids and many other matrices. It summarizes the advances in sensing and biosensing methods for the detection of BPs since 2010. Furthermore, the article discusses challenges and future perspectives in the development of novel sensing methods for the detection of BP analogs. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The behavior of NaBH4 (THB) and the amine boranes, NH3BH3 (AB), tertbutylNH(2)BH(3) (TBAB), Me2NHBH3 (DMAB) was investigated in continuous flow chemical vapor generation of H2Se from aqueous Se-IV coupled with atomic absorption spectrometry. Unexpected higher efficiency of H2Se generation was obtained with amine boranes compared to THB (TBAB > AB > THB) using millimolar concentration of reductant (0.001-0.1 mol L-1) under strongly acidic conditions (HCl, HClO4, H2SO4, HNO3, 0.5 -5 mol L-1 H+). Analytical applicability of the CVG system was tested by the determination of SeIV in natural water samples certified reference materials, using 0.01 mol L-1 TBAB in 0.5 M H2SO4. In order to explain this unexpected higher efficiency of amine boranes with respect of THB, the kinetic of hydrolysis of AB, TBAB and DMAB was investigated in acid media typically employed in chemical vapor generation for trace element determination. The kinetic was investigated by monitoring the rate the hydrogen gas evolved during hydrolysis, using a laboratory made thermostated reaction cell. Kinetics were measured for AB, TBAB and DMAB in 0.1, 0.5, 5 mol L-1 HCl or HClO4 reaction media and in 0.1 mol L-1 cysteine +0.1 mol L-1 HCl or HClO4 buffer, for reaction times from 0 to 30 min. Under strongly acidic conditions, the rates of hydrogen evolution produced by amine boranes hydrolysis appear to be much slower than those predicted by a pseudo-first order reaction and using the rate constants reported in the literature. This suggests that, at elevated acidities (5 mol L-1 HCl or HClO4), the hydrolysis of amine boranes takes place in two steps, generating a first amount of H-2 (0.67-1.15 mol) much faster than the remaining about 2 mol. This evidence indicates a different mechanism of hydrolysis to the one accepted in the literature for amine boranes. The relatively high efficiencies of H2Se observed with amine borane reduction of inorganic SeIV at elevated acidities can be addressed to the action of borane intermediates, most probably amine borane cations, formed during amine borane hydrolysis in the same reaction conditions.

AB Colloidal gold immunochromatographic assay (ICA) has poor sensitivity when used for Escherichia coli O157:H7 (E. coli O157:H7) detection. Eu (III)-doped polystyrene nanoparticle (EuNP) has a large range of stokes shift, long decay time, and wide excitation spectrum and narrow emission spectra. EuNP has been used as novel probe in ICA to improve sensitivity. In this study, carboxyl-modified EuNPs were prepared with different linkers. ICA based on EuNP, EuNP-6 carbon chain (CC) complex, EuNP-200CC complex, EuNP-1000CC complex, and EuNP-streptavidin (EuNP-SA) complex were systematically compared for the detection of E. coli O157:H7. Under optimized working conditions, the limits of detection (LOD) of EuNP-ICA, EuNP-6CC-ICA, EuNP-200CC-ICA, EuNP-1000CC-ICA, and EuNP-SA-ICA were 9.54 x 10(2), 1.59 x 10(2), 3.18 x 10(2), 2.98 x 10(2), and 1.08 x 10(2) colony-forming units (CFU) mL(-1), respectively. The linear ranges of EuNP-ICA, EuNP-6CC-ICA, EuNP-200CC-ICA, EuNP-1000CC-ICA, and EuNP-SA-ICA were 6.36 x 10(2) -1.59 x 10(5), 3.18 x 10(2)-1.59 x 10(5), 6.36 x 10(2)-1.59 x 10(5), 6.36 x 10(2)-1.59 x 10(5), and 8.0 x 10(1) -1.59 x 10(5) CFU mL(-1), respectively. EuNP-SA-ICA exhibited the highest sensitivity and the widest linear range with good specificity, accuracy, and precision. It could be a promising analytical method for detecting E. coli O157:H7 in food samples. EuNP-SA-ICA may be a good model for detecting low concentrations of other food-borne pathogens.

AB In the present study, a facile fluorescence aptasensor based on two-dimensional sheet metal-organic frameworks of N,N-bis(2-hydroxyethyl)dithiooxamidato copper(II) (H(2)dtoaCu) was developed for the sensitive detection of adenosine triphosphate (ATP). The sensing mechanism was based on the non-covalent interaction between FAM-labeled (fluorescein amidite) ATP aptamers and H(2)dtoaCu. In the absence of ATP, the FAM-labeled aptamer readily adsorbs onto H(2)dtoaCu, mainly via pi-pi stacking and hydrogen bond interactions between the nucleotide bases and the H(2)dtoaCu surface, leading to the reduction of fluorescence intensity of the FAM by photoinduced electron transfer (PET). In the presence of ATP, the FAM-labeled aptamer specifically forms ATP-binding aptamer complexes which exhibit only weak adsorption on the H(2)dtoaCu surface. Thus, the fluorescence of the FAM-labeled ATP aptamer remained largely unchanged. The fluorescence aptasensor exhibited a good linear relationship between the fluorescence intensity and the logarithm concentration of ATP over a range of 25-400 nM, with a detection limit of 8.19 nM (3S/N). ATP analogs such as guanosine triphosphate, uridine triphosphate, and cytidine triphosphate have negligible effect on the aptasensor performance due to the high selectivity of the ATP aptamer to its target, showing promising potential in real sample analysis.

AB A new experimental setup combining DSC, Raman and Brillouin spectroscopies was developed. In order to estimate its accuracy and stability a study of silicon and the alpha-beta quartz phase transition were performed. The data obtained demonstrated good agreement with previous studies using these three different techniques. For quartz, the temperature behavior of its 147 cm(-1) Raman mode was studied in detail. Using a two-phonon coupling treatment of the Raman band, we show for the first time that its behavior can be well described by Landau theory of first-order phase transitions. The combined DSC-Raman-Brillouin technique is a powerful tool for material science capable of studying thermal, structural and elastic properties simultaneously. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB In this work, an effective controlled-release biosensor based on Au nanocages (AuNCs) capped with disulfide-containing DNA molecular gates was developed for ultra-sensitive and highly selective detection of glutathione (GSH). Oligonucleotides containing the S-S bonds were assembled on the surface of the AuNCs by means of electrostatic interactions in order to inhibit the release of fluorescent molecules such as Rhodamine B (RhB) loaded by AuNCs. In the presence of GSH, due to the specific cleavage of S-S bonds in disulfide-containing single-stranded DNAs (ssDNAs) as well as their subsequent departure from the surface of AuNCs, the pores could be opened, and then the dye molecules would be released from AuNCs. The concentration of GSH ranged from 1.0 x 10(-12) to 6.0 x 10(-10) M could be detected. The developed amplification strategy based on the controlled-release of fluorescent molecules reached an extraordinary sensitivity of GSH. A detection limit of as low as 4.8 x 10(-13) M with an excellent selectivity toward GSH could be achieved. The results of fluorescence microscopy imaging of GSH in living cells indicate that the fabricated system is an efficient controlled-release biosensor in response to intracellular target molecules and predict its potential use for in situ molecular imaging in living systems.

AB This work describes for the first time a functional electrolyte system setup for anionic isotachophoresis (ITP) with electrospray-ionization mass-spectrometric (ESI-MS) detection in the neutral to medium-alkaline pH range. So far no application was published on the analysis of very weak acids by anionic ITP-MS although there is a broad spectrum of potential analytes with pK(a) values in the range 5-10, where application of this technique promises interesting gains in both sensitivity and specificity. The problem so far was the lack of anionic ESI-compatible ITP systems in the mentioned pH range as all typical volatile anionic system components are fully ionized at neutral and alkaline pH and thus too fast to suit as terminators. We propose an original solution of the problem based on the combination of two ITP methods: (i) use of the hydroxyl ion as a natural and ESI-compatible terminator, and (ii) use of configurations based on moving-boundary ITP. The former method ensures effective stacking of analytes by an alkaline terminator of sufficiently low mobility and the latter offers increased flexibility for tuning of the separation window and selectivity according to actual needs. A theoretical description of the proposed model is presented and applied to the design of very simple functional electrolyte configurations. The properties of example systems are demonstrated by both computer simulation and experiments with a group of model analytes. Potential effects of carbon dioxide present in the solutions are demonstrated for particular systems. Experimental results confirm that the proposed methodology is well capable of performing sensitive and selective ITP-MS analyses of very weak acidic analytes (e.g. sulfonamides or chlorophenols).

AB Column chromatographic methods have been developed to separate no-carrier-added Ag-111 from proton irradiated thorium targets and associated fission products as an ancillary process to an existing Ac-225 separation design. Herein we report the separation of Ag-111 both prior and subsequent to Ac-225 recovery using CL resin, a solvent impregnated resin (SIR) that carries an organic solution of alkyl phosphine sulfides (R3P = S) and alkyl phosphine oxides (R3P = O). The recovery yield of Ag-111 was 93 +/- 9% with a radiochemical purity of 99.9% (prior) and 87 +/- 9% with a radiochemical purity of 99.9% (subsequent to) Ac-225 recovery. Both processes were successfully performed with insignificant impacts on Ac-225 yields or quality. Measured equilibrium distribution coefficients for silver and ruthenium (a residual contaminant) on CL resin in hydrochloric and nitric acid media are reported, to the best of our knowledge, for the first time. Additionally, measured cross sections for the production of Ag-111 and Ag-110m for the Th-232(p,f)(110m,111Ag) reactions are reported within. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A number of polyfunctional thiols are well-recognised as some of the most potent aroma compounds in nature and have been identified in various foods, and beverages such as wine. These potent character impact compounds are present at nanogram-per-litre levels and are particularly challenging to measure. Where present, enantiomeric forms having different odour qualities further complicate the analysis. In this work, a chiral high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS) method using stable isotope dilution analysis (SIDA) has been developed and validated for the individual enantiomers of 3-sulfanylhexan-1-ol (3-SH, 1) and its O-acetate, 3-sulfanylhexyl acetate (3-SHA, 2), in wine after extraction as their 4-thiopyridine derivatives. Authentic derivatised thiols were first synthesised and used for chiral column screening and method development with polysaccharide-based HPLC phases. Validation of the method using a Lux Amylose-1 column for quantification of the enantiomers of 1 and 2 gave linear calibrations, and excellent figures for accuracy (recovery: 90%-11%, Z-score: -1.8-1.9), precision (RSDr<8%), and limits of detection (0.7 ng L-1 or less) in model media and different wine matrices. The newly developed method was applied to determine the enantiomer profiles of 1 and 2 in range of commercial wines. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Herein, we have reported the development of a simple, rapid, and low cost colorimetric method for the detection of antibiotic based on target-activated split peroxidase DNAzyme coupled with dual nicking enzyme signal amplification (NESA). To lower background signal in G-quadruplex DNAzyme-based detection, the two split G-rich parts are caged into two different hairpin probes, respectively, preventing the two parts from assembling into the G-quadruplex structure. By the combination of restriction endonuclease-assisted cleavage reaction with the spilt G-quadruplex probes, target-modulated release of the two split G-rich parts is achieved, affording high specificity of antibiotic detection. Our strategy features with several aspects. First, the less background signal produced by the self-assembly of G-quadruplex in the absence of target is effectively eliminated owing to the pre-blocking of the two split G-rich parts. Second, dual NESA coupled G-quadruplex DNAzyme amplification strategy is integrated with colorimetric assay of antibiotic, which significantly improves the detection sensitivity. Third, peroxidasemimicking DNAzyme is used as biocatalyst in our reaction system, which can catalyze the oxidation of 2,2' - azino - bis (3 - ethylbenzothiozoline - 6 - sulfonic acid) (ABTS(2-)) mediated by H2O2 to generate the colored radical anion (ABTS(center dot-)), allowing to low cost and visual detection of antibiotic by the naked eye. Under optimized conditions, the results revealed the proposed biosensor exhibits excellent specificity and sensitivity toward kanamycin with a detection limit as low as 14.7 pM. Hence, the target-activated split G-quadruplex DNAzyme and dual NESA-based strategy provides a useful and practical platform for antibiotic residues determination and other analytes detection in bio-analysis.

AB Prostate cancer is one of the most common cancers among men and can in its later stages cause serious medical problems. Due to the limited suitability of current diagnostic biochemical markers, new biomarkers for the detection of prostate cancer are highly sought after. An ideal biomarker should serve as a reliable prognostic marker, be applicable for early diagnosis, and be applicable for monitoring of therapeutic response. One potential candidate is glutamate carboxypeptidase II (GCPII), also known as prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA), which has a promising role for direct imaging. GCPII is considerably over-expressed on cancerous prostatic epithelial cells; its analysis typically follows radiological or spectrophotometric principles. Its role as a biomarker present in blood has been recently investigated and potential correlation between a concentration of GCPII and prostate cancer has been proposed. The wider inclusion of GCPII detection in clinical praxis limits mainly the time and cost per analysis. Here, we present a novel analytical nanosensor applicable to quantification of GCPII in human whole blood consisted of Fe3O4@Ag magnetic nanocomposite surface-functionalized by an artificial antibody (low-molecular-weight GCPII synthetic inhibitor). The nanocomposite allows a simple magnetic isolation of GCPII using external magnetic force and its consecutive determination by magnetically assisted surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy (MA-SERS) with a limit of detection 6 pmol. L-1. This method enables a rapid determination of picomolar concentrations of GCPII in whole human blood of healthy individuals using a standard addition method without a complicated sample pre-treatment.

AB In this paper, we developed a sensitive fluorescence biosensor for tyrosinase (TYR) and acid phosphatase (ACP) activity detection based on nitrogen-doped graphene quantum dots (N-GQDs). Tyrosine could be catalyzed by TYR to generate dopaquinone, which could efficiently quench the fluorescence of N-GQDs, and the degree of fluorescence quenching of N-GQDs was proportional to the concentration of TYR. In the presence of ACP, L-Ascorbic acid-2-phosphate (AAP) was hydrolyzed to generate ascorbic acid (AA), and dopaquinone was reduced to L-dopa, resulting in the fluorescence recovery of the quenched fluorescence by dopaquinone. Thus, a novel fluorescence biosensor for the detection of TYR and ACP activity based on N-GQDs was constructed. Under the optimized experimental conditions, the fluorescence intensity was linearly correlated with the concentration of TYR and ACP in the range of 0.43-3.85 UmL(-1) and 0.04-0.7 mU mL(-1) with a detection limit of 0.15 UmL(-1) and 0.014 mU mL(-1), respectively. The feasibility of the proposed biosensor in real samples assay was also studied and satisfactory results were obtained. (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Sensitivity enhancement and proteins adsorption are the common challenges faced in protein immunoassays. In this work, an ultrasensitive and protein-resistant label-free amperometric immunosening platform for carcinoma antigen-125 (CA125) based on redox polyaniline-polythionine hydrogel (PANI-PThi gel) was developed. The as-prepared hydrogel, which was facilely synthesized by electro-polymerization, exhibited good conductivity and strong hydrophilicity while the sensitivity and specificity of the immunosensor can be enhanced. Furthermore, the as-prepared AuNPs functionalized PANI-PThi gel exhibited strong current signal and H2O2 electrocatalytic ability, which guaranteed a large current variable range. Based on these, the prepared immunosensor revealed a wide linear range from 0.0001 U mL(-1) to 1 kU mL(-1), a limit of detection of 0.00125 U mL(-1) and its sensitivity was at least threefold higher than previous works. More importantly, the prepared immunosensor exhibited excellent specificity, making it capable of assaying CA125 in human serum. (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Tailor-made materials for the purification of proteins with His-tag was designed through synergizing the selectivity of surface sieving and metal ion affinity. By excluding impurity proteins out of the surface polymer network, such materials could purify His-tagged proteins from the crude cell lysis with purity up to 90%, improved by 14% compared to that obtained by the commercial metal chelating affinity materials. This study might promote the His-tagged protein purification to a new level. (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this paper, we describe a validated paper-based microfluidic analytical device for the simultaneous quantification of two important biomarkers of renal function in urine. This paper platform provides an inexpensive, simple, and easy to use colorimetric method for the quantification of creatinine (CRN) and uric acid (UA) in urine samples. The microfluidic paper-based analytical device (mu PAD) consists of a main channel with three identical arms, each containing a circular testing zone and a circular uptake zone. Creatinine detection is based on the Jaffe reaction, in which CRN reacts with picrate to form an orange-red product. Uric acid quantification is based on the reduction of Fe3+ to Fe2+ by UA, which is detected in a colorimetric reaction using 1,10-phenanthroline. Under optimum conditions, obtained through chemometrics, the concentrations of the analytes showed good linear correlations with the effective in-tensities, and the method presented satisfactory repeatability. The limits of detection and the linear ranges, respectively, were 15.7 mg L-1 and 50-600 mg L-1 for CRN and 16.5 mg L-1 and 50-500 mg L-1 for UA. There were no statistically significant differences between the results obtained using the mPAD and a chromatographic comparative method (Student's t-test at 95% confidence level).

AB Since polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) is notorious for its severe sorption to biological compounds and even nanoparticles, thermoplastics become a promising substrate for microdevices. Although CO2 laser engraving is an efficient method for thermoplastic device fabrication, it accompanies with poor bonding issues due to severe bulging and large feature size determined by the diameter of laser beam. In this study, a low-cost microfabrication method is proposed by reversibly sealing a 1 mm thick polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) over an engraving substrate to reduce channel feature size and minimize bulges of laser engraved channels. PMMA, polycarbonate (PC), polystyrene (PS), perfluoroalkoxy alkane (PFA), cyclic-olefin polymers (COP) and polylactic acid (PLA) were found compatible with this sacrificial layer assisted laser engraving technique. Microchannel width as small as similar to 40 mu m was attainable by a laser beam that was 5 times larger in diameter. Bulging height was significantly reduced to less 5 mu m for most substrates, which facilitated leak proof device bonding without channel deformation. Microdevices with high aspect ratio channels were prepared to demonstrate the applicability of this microfabrication method. We believe this fast and low-cost fabrication approach for thermoplastics will be of interest to researchers who have encountered problem with polydimethylsiloxane based microdevices in their applications.

AB By coupling surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) with thin-layer chromatography (TLC), a powerful method for detecting complex samples was successfully developed. However, in the TLC-SERS method, metal nanoparticles serving as the SERS-active substrate are likely to disturb the detection of target compounds, particularly in overlapping compounds after TLC development. In addition, the SERS detection of compounds that are invisible under both visible light and UV254/365 after TLC development is still a significant challenge. In this study, we demonstrated a facile strategy to fabricate a TLC plate with metal-organic framework-modified gold nanoparticles as a separable SERS substrate, on which all separated components, including overlapping and invisible compounds, could be detected by a point-by-point SERS scan along the developing direction. Rhodamine 6G (R6G) was used as a probe to evaluate the performance of the substrate. The results indicated that the substrate provided good sensitivity and reproducibility, and optimal SERS signals could be collected in 5 s. Furthermore, this new substrate exhibited a long shelf life. Thus, our method has great potential for the sensitive and rapid detection of overlapping and invisible compounds in complex samples after TLC development. (c) 2017 The Author(s).

AB In this work, a new, simple, rapid, and environmentally friendly method with a high sample clean-up capability termed as centrifugeless ultrasound-assisted dispersive micro solid-phase extraction coupled with salting-out ultrasound-assisted liquid-liquid microextraction based on solidification of a floating organic droplet followed by high performance liquid chromatography is introduced for the first time. In this method, the three non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs diclofenac, ibuprofen, and mefenamic acid are first extracted based on an effective nanoadsorbent named as the layered double hydroxide-carbon nanotube nanohybrid. The first step provides a rapid and convenient way to separate the adsorbent from the sample matrix by a syringe nanofilter without additional centrifugation. In the next step, which is based upon the salting-out effect, after emulsification in the presence of ultrasonic irradiation, the phase separation is simply achieved through the salting-out phenomenon, and the extracting solvent is suspended on top of the sample solution. Under the optimal experimental conditions including the initial pH value of 6.0, 8.0 mg of the nanohybrid, 3 min ultrasonic time, 100 mu L elution solvent (first step), secondary pH value of 3.0, 60 mu L of 1-undecanol, 60 s ultrasonic time, and flow rate of 3 mL min(-1) (second step), good responses were obtained for diclofenac, ibuprofen, and mefenamic acid in the concentration ranges of 0.8-2000, 0.8-2500, and 0.5-2000 ng mL(-1), respectively, with low limits of detection ranging from 0.1 to 0.2 ng mL(-1). The intra-day and inter-day precisions for the target analytes at the three concentration levels were in the ranges of 6.1-7.8% and 6.3-8.1%, respectively. The proposed method was also successfully applied to the biological and waste water samples, and excellent recoveries were obtained in the range of 92.9-103.1% even when the matrix was complex.
