AB MicroRNAs have been proved to be the biomarker for early detection of pancreatic cancer and the precisely quantitation of the MicroRNA-10b in the blood samples even can distinguish pancreatic cancer from chronic pancreatitis (CP) and normal controls (NC). In this study, we developed a DSN-assisted dual-SERS biosensor for microRNA-10b in exosome and residual plasma of blood samples detection based on the Fe3O4@Ag-DNA-Au@Ag@DTNB (SERS tag) conjugates. In presence of target microRNA, it can hybridized with the complementary DNA probes. DSN enzyme was then added to selectively cleaves the DNA probe of the DNA/microRNA duplex, SERS tags can be released from the Fe3O4@Ag and SERS intensity quenching can be triggered, the released microRNA can enter the cycle to decluster other DNA and SERS tags. Due to the dual-SERS enhancement of the Fe3O4@Ag-SERS tag conjugates and the recycling signal amplification, a detection limit of 1 aM with single-base recognition can be performed by one step. The target microRNA in plasma-derived exosome and residual supernatant plasma of blood samples from pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), chronic pancreatitis (CP) and normal controls (NC) were directly quantified and significant SERS signal distinction can be found among them. The precise quantitation, one-step and one-pot operation can ensure this assay a promising future for point-of-care cancer diagnosis technology.

AB In this work, a novel, facile, clean synthesis of monodisperse Au nanoparticles (AuNPs) with an average diameter of 5 TIM was achieved by reducing HAuCl4 with dihydroxylatopillar[5]arene (2HP5) in basic solution without the use of harsh reagents and/or external energy. Accordingly, toluidine blue (TB), one electrochemcial indicator, could enter into the cavity of 2HP5 to fabricate host-guest complex through strong electrostatic interaction and charge-transfer interaction, which significantly enhanced the loading quantity of TB and effectively suppressed the leaking of TB resulting in an ultrasensitive and robust electrochemical response. More importantly, the integration of 2HP5-stabilized AuNPs and Pd-decorated MnO2 nanocomposites (2HP5@Au-Pd/MnO2) might usually obtain a novel functional-enhanced materials and lead to new properties and improving the analytical performance and robustness of electrochemical devices. Therefore, we construct a sandwich-type electrochemical immunosensor using TB-2HP5@Au-Pd/MnO2 nanocomposites as the transducing materials for robust and ultrasensitive detection of cardiac troponin I (cTnI), a significant biomarker of acute myocardial infarction. As anticipated, this immunosensor had remarkable robustness, sensitivity, stability, specificity, and corresponded linearly to the concentration of cTnI over a wide range from 0.005 to 20 ng mL(-1) with a low detection limit of 2 pg mL(-1) (S/N = 3). The proposed electrochemical immunosensor showed acceptable recoveries in human serum, indicating that macrocycle-stabilized metal nanoparticle might be a promising emerging transducer material for the detection of biological markers.

AB This study demonstrates a novel and rapid antibacterial susceptibility testing (AST) method, called fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) probe-based AST (F-AST), which relies on a nuclease-activated FRET probe that detects bacterial nucleases released by antibiotic-induced bacterial lysis. Three quality control (QC) strains and two additional clinically important strains were tested, and the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values from both gold standard AST method (broth microdilution (BMD)) and the new F-AST method were compared. The resulting fluorescence signals from the F-AST method were obtained within 3-6 h and were consistent with MIC values obtained from the BMD method, which took more than 16 h. Thus, the F-AST method is a simple and rapid tool to detect antibacterial susceptibility, including MIC values, and provides a basis for rapid clinical treatments.

AB Rational design and fabrication of Z-scheme visible-light-driven photoactive materials have drawn much attention owing to their great potential in handling environment and energy crisis. In this work, Z-scheme Bi2S3/nitrogen-doped graphene quantum dots (NGQDs) with superior photoelectric conversion efficiency were designed and fabricated, which demonstrated enhanced photoactivity compared with Bi2S3 owing to the improved separation efficiency of photogenerated electron and hole pairs. The emphasis was put on designing Z-scheme Bi2S3/NGQDs, and then the mechanism of Z-scheme charge transfer mode was verified by the electron spin resonance (ESR) technique. On this basis, the proposed sensor exhibited a wide linear range of 0.1-120 nM and a detection limit of 0.03 nM (S/N = 3) for SDM, with high sensitivity (0.075 mu A nM(-1)), good selectivity and stability. Moreover, the proposed PEC aptasensor using Bi2S3/NGQDs as the photoelectrode achieved sensitive and selective determination of sulfadimethoxine in milk samples. This work could provide some ideas for designing other Z-scheme photoactive species and insights into the charge transfer mechanism of Z-scheme. Furthermore, the promising applicability of PEC aptasensor using photoactive species could be extended to other accurate monitoring for contaminants.

AB Here we present a gold nanorod-based platform for the sequence-specific detection of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) point mutations without the need for amplification or fluorescence labeling. Peptide nucleic acid probes complimentary to the G12V mutation in the KRAS gene were conjugated to gold nanorods, and the localized surface plasmon resonance absorbance through the sample was measured after exposure to synthetic ctDNA at various concentrations. Each step of the reaction was thoroughly controlled, starting from reagent concentrations and including conjugation, sonication, and incubation time. The platform was evaluated in both buffer and spiked healthy patient serum, demonstrating a linear working range below 125 nanograms of ctDNA per milliliter solution, and an effective limit of detection of 2 nanograms of ctDNA per milliliter. A clear distinction between mutant and wild type synthetic ctDNA was also found using this platform. In order to improve upon the selectivity of the sensor, a DNA hybridization simulation was performed to understand how the addition of mutations to the peptide nucleic acid probe could enhance the selectivity for capture of mutant over wild type sequences. The top candidate from the simulations, which had an additional mutation two base pairs away from the mutation of interest, had a significant impact on the selectivity between mutant and wild type capture. This paper provides a framework for sequence-specific capture of ctDNA, and a method of improving selectivity for desired point mutations through careful probe design.

AB Detailed knowledge regarding sensor based technologies for the detection of food contamination often remains concealed within scientific journals or divided between numerous commercial kits which prevents optimal connectivity between companies and end-users. To overcome this barrier The End user Sensor Tree (TEST) has been developed. TEST is a comprehensive, interactive platform including over 900 sensor based methods, retrieved from the scientific literature and commercial market, for aquatic-toxins, mycotoxins, pesticides and microorganism detection. Key analytical parameters are recorded in excel files while a novel classification system is used which provides, tailor-made, experts' feedback using an online decision tree and database introduced here. Additionally, a critical comparison of reviewed sensors is presented alongside a global perspective on research pioneers and commercially available products. The lack of commercial uptake of the academically popular electrochemical and nanomaterial based sensors, as well as multiplexing platforms became very apparent and reasons for this anomaly are discussed.

The incidence of this disease is increasing worldwide, in which calcium oxalate is the major composition forming the urinary calculus. Therefore, to monitor this disease for the prevention and treatment, measuring the oxalate in the urine is of great significance. Here, a rapid and sensitive colorimetric method was developed based on 3,3',5,5'-tetramethylbenzidine-manganese dioxide (TMB-MnO2) nanosheets for oxalate detection. MnO2 nanosheets acted as an efficient biomimetic oxidase to catalyze the reaction with TMB and oxalate. Pale yellow TMB can be oxidized to blue oxide TMB catalyzed by BSA-stabilized MnO2 nanosheets, and oxalate can selectively inhibit this reaction by consuming and reacting with MnO2 nanosheets, thus achieving the quantitative detection of oxalate. Moreover, a home-made bionic electronic-eye (E-eye) system was developed as a portable in-situ detection platform to efficiently measure the oxalate concentrations in 10 s by direct photographing. By optimizing experimental conditions, this method shows a wide linear range (7.8 mu M to 250 mu M) and a low detection limit (0.91 mu M) for oxalate detection. Besides, this method exhibits high selectivity even with 80-fold interfering chemicals. Furthermore, the performance of the method was validated by testing the artificial urine samples, indicating its great potential for monitoring and diagnosis of urolithiasis in point-of-care applications.

AB Gold nanoclusters (Au NCs) have been shown to be prospective nanoscale electrochemiluminescence (ECL) materials that are being extensively explored in bioanalysis. However, the low ECL efficiency of Au NCs has been a bottleneck barrier for their better bioapplications. To overcome this disadvantage, a low oxidation potential co-reactant N,N-diisopropylethylenediamine (DPEA) was first used to prepare self-enhanced Au NCs (Au-DPEA NCs) for drastically enhancing the ECL efficiency of Au NCs in this study. In addition, an efficient multi-site landing DNA walker with multidirectional motion track and rapid payloads release compared to directional DNA walker was constructed for converting target mucin 1 (MUC1) to intermediate DNA and achieving significant signal amplification. On the basis of the Au-DPEA NCs as efficient ECL signal labels and multi-site landing DNA walker as signal amplification strategy, an ECL aptasensor was established for the ultrasensitive detection of MUC1 in the range from 1 fg mL(-1) to 1 ng mL(-1) with a limit of detection down to 0.54 fg mL(-1). The results demonstrated that the present study opened a new research direction for the development of high-efficiency Au NCs indicator as well as ultrasensitive ECL sensing platform for applications in clinical and bioanalysis.

AB In this work, a photoactive material, Graphdiyne (GDY) loaded with AuNPs (AuNPs-GDY), was successfully synthesized. The fabricated material made use of the natural band-gap structure of GDY, which could produce hole-electron pairs and the plasmon resonance effect of AuNPs to obtain a high photoelectrochemical (PEC) response. AuNPs-GDY PEC response changed with the mass ratio of GDY to tetrachloroauric acid. When the mass ratio of GDY to tetrachloroauric acid was 1:2.5, AuNPs-GDY exhibited the best PEC performance. Thus, the best one was selected as the photoactive material to establish a PEC biosensor for microRNA detection. The PEC biosensor used the alkaline phosphatases as catalyzer to generate ascorbic acid in situ, which provided a low background signal and a high PEC response. The cancer marker, MicroRNA let-7a, was chosen as a target model. Under optimal condition, potential 300 mV and pH 8.0, the PEC biosensor had a detection limit of 13 x 10(-19) M and a good linearity with microRNA let-7a concentration ranged from 1.0 x 10(-18) M to 1.0 x 10(-1) M. This PEC biosensor opened a promising platform using GDY to fabricate analytical method and detect microRNA at ultralow levels for diagnoses.

AB Graphene is a 2-dimensional nanomaterial with an atomic thickness has attracted a strong scientific interest owing to their remarkable optical, electronic, thermal, mechanical and electrochemical properties. Graphene-based materials particularly graphene oxide and reduced graphene oxide are widely utilized in various applications ranging from food industry, environmental monitoring and biomedical fields as well as in the development of various types of biosensing devices. The richness in oxygen functional groups in the materials serves as a catalysis for the development of biosensors/electrochemical biosensors which promotes for an attachment of biological recognition elements, surface functionalization and compatible with micro- and nano-bio-environment. In this review, the graphene-based materials application in electrochemical biosensors based on recent advancement (e.g; the surface modification and analytical performances) and the utilization of such biosensors to monitor the noncommunicable diseases are presented. The detection performances of the graphene-based electrochemical biosensors are in the range of ng/mL and have reached up to fg/mL in detecting the targets of NCDs with higher selectivity, sensitivity and stability with good reproducibility attributes. We have discussed the advances while addressing the very specific biomarkers for the NCDs detection. Challenges and possible future research directions for the NCDs detection based on graphene nanocomposite with other 2D nanomaterials are outlined.

AB Developing low-cost, portable and simple analysis tools is of vital importance for food safety point-of-care testing. Therefore, herein, a new low-cost, simple to fabricate, disposable, electrochemical mast cell-based paper sensor is proposed and developed to sensitively determine the major milk allergen casein. Then, a graphene (GN)/carbon nanofiber (CN)/Gelatin methacryloyl (GelMA) composite material with high conductivity and good biocompatibility was modified on the cell-based paper sensor to improve the electrical conductivity and provide a sensing recognition interface for the immobilization of rat basophilic leukemia (RBL-2H3) mast cells. The cyclic voltammetry and differential pulse voltammetry measurement of the mast cells in the paper sensor revealed an irreversible anodic peak, whose peak current is proportional to the number of cells in the range from 1 x 10(2) to 1 x 10(8) cells/mL. For the milk allergen detection tests, mast cells exposed to the casein caused a significant reduction in the current signal, displaying an inverse dose-dependent relationship. The developed cell sensor exhibited a range of linearity between 1 x 10(-7) and 1 x 10(-8) g/mL of casein with a detection limit of 3.2 x 10(-8) g/mL and a great reproducibility and selectivity. The electrochemical responses obtained using the cell-based paper sensor were well consistent with the conventional detection assay, with good stability and reproducibility. Therefore, a simple and novel electrochemical method for food allergens detection was developed, demonstrating its potential application in the food safety determination and evaluation.

AB A highly sensitive and selective glutamate biosensor using glutamate Oxidase (GlUtOx) immobilized platinum nanoparticle (PtNP) decorated multiwall carbon nanotube (MWCNTs)/polypyrrole (PPy) composite on glassy carbon electrodes (GC) is demonstrated. PtNP decorated MWCNTs (Pt-MWCNTs), PPy and Pt-MWCNTs/PPy composite were characterized by Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscope (FESEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Raman analysis to confirm the formation of the nanocomposite. The glutamate Oxidase (GlUtOx) was immobilized on a GC/Pt-MWCNTs/PPy and characterized by the cyclic voltammetry (CV) and impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analysis. The fabricated L-glutamate biosensor exhibited high sensitivity (723.08 A cm(-2) mM(-1)) with less response time (3 s) with a detection limit of 0.88 mu M. The dynamic range from 10 to 100 mu M with a correlation coefficient (R2) of 0.985 was observed for the L-glutamate biosensor. The analytical recovery of added L-glutamate acid (50 and 100 mu M) in human serum soup were 96.1% and 97.5% respectively. The enzyme immobilized GC/Pt-MWCNTs/PPy/G1UtOx bioelectrode lost 12.6% and 23.8% of its initial activity after 30 days when stored at -20 degrees C and 4 degrees C respectively.

AB Determination of hepatotoxic drugs is critical for both clinical diagnosis and quantity control of their pharmaceutical formulations. In this work, a facile and sensitive sensor based on MXene modified screen-printed electrode (MXene/SPE) has been developed for detection of acetaminophen (ACOP) and isoniazid (INZ), which are two commonly used drugs but might induce liver damage in certain circumstances. MXene showed excellent electrocatalytic activity toward the oxidation of ACOP and INZ compared with bare SPE in 0.1 M H2SO4, and the separated oxidation peak potentials ensured simultaneous detection of the targets with wide linear ranges from 0.25 to 2000 mu M for ACOP and 0.1-4.6 mM for INZ. The detection limits of ACOP and INZ were 0.048 mu M and 0.064 mM, respectively. (S/N = 3). MXene/SPE exhibits good stability, reproducibility and repeatability, and the method has been successfully applied for detection of ACOP and INZ in their pharmaceutical and biological samples with satisfactory recovery.

AB In this study, a facile electrochemical sensing platform based on thin-layer MoS2 and thionin (MoS2-Thi) composites was constructed for the sensitive and rapid detection of zearalenone (ZEA) in human biofluids. MoS2-Thi composites with a thin-layer MoS2 structure and large specific surface area were synthesized via a simple ultrasound exfoliation method. To further enhance the performance of the platform but without increasing the complexity of the fabrication process, ZEA antibodies were modified with Pt nanoparticles (Pt NPs) using an environmentally friendly method, where they had a much wider linear range and four times higher sensitivity compared with the original ZEA monoclonal antibody (ZEA-MAb). Under the optimal conditions, the electrochemical responses of the MoS2-Thi composite-based immunosensor were linear (R-2 = 0.9915) when the ZEA concentrations ranged from 0.01 to 50 ng mL(-1). The proposed immunosensor could detect ZEA at concentrations as low as 0.005 ng mL(-1). with excellent selectivity. The immunosensor exhibited acceptable stability with high reproducibility and accuracy, and it was applied successfully for determining ZEA in human plasma and urine samples. Our findings indicated that the proposed MoS2-Thi composite-based electrochemical sensing platform provides a new approach for the rapid and sensitive bioanalysis of ZEA, and it may also be extended to other mycotoxins for multiplex detection.

AB Tetracycline (TC) is a veterinary drug, wildly prescribed for prophylactic and therapeutic purposes. Consequently, its remaining residues in food products have to be regularized. We report in this paper about the development of a novel immunosensor based on an integrated bio micro-electromechanical system (Bio-MEMS) containing eight gold microelectrodes (mu WEs), an integrated silver and platinum reference and counter electrodes, respectively. TC immobilization on the mu WEs surface was conducted using three methods. The first through functionalization with 4-aminophenylacetic acid (CMA), the second by functionalization with CMA followed by preconcentration of a new structure of magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) coated with poly (pyrrole-co-pyrrole-2-carboxylic acid) (Py/Py-COOH/MNPs) cross-linked with Ab-TC, and the last one directly through the functionalization with Py/Py-COOH/MNPs. The analyte was quantified by competitive detection with TC immobilized on the mu WEs surface toward specific polyclonal antibody (Ab-TC), using a mixture of a fixed concentration of Ab-TC and decreasing levels of TC one from 0.1 pg mL(-1) to 1000 pg mL(-1). Microcontact printing, followed by fluorescence microscopy characterization were performed during the functionalization of the immunosensor surface to certify that the corresponding immune detection process is taking place. This immunosensor was found to be highly sensitive with a limit of detection of 1.2 pg mL(-1) and specific in the presence of interferents. The standard addition method was exploited to detect TC in honey samples. The present immunosensor platform is up-and-coming for TC detection which can dramatically decrease the time of analysis providing a new pathway for advanced immunoassays development in industrial food control.

AB Gene expression analysis at the point-of-care is important for rapid disease diagnosis, but traditional techniques are limited by multiplexing capabilities, bulky equipment, and cost. We present a gene expression analysis platform using a giant magnetoresistive (GMR) biosensor array, which allows multiplexed transcript detection and quantification through cost-effective magnetic detection. In this work, we have characterized the sensitivity, dynamic range, and quantification accuracy of Polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-amplified complementary DNA (cDNA) on the GMR for the reference gene GAPDH. A synthetic GAPDH single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) standard was used to calibrate the detection, and ssDNA dilutions were qPCR-amplified to obtain a standard curve. We demonstrate that the GMR platform provides a dynamic range of 4 orders of magnitude and a limit of detection of 1 pM and 0.1 pM respectively for 15 and 18-cycle amplified synthetic GAPDH PCR products. The quantitative results of GMR analysis of cell-line RNA were confirmed by qPCR.

AB Preclinical efficacy and toxicity assessment of drug candidates plays a significant role in drug discovery and development. Traditional planar cell culture is a common way to perform the preclinical drug test, but it is difficult to correctly predict the drug efficacy and toxicity due to the simple two-dimensional (2D) extracellular microenvironment. Compared to the planar cell culture, three-dimensional (3D) cell culture system can better mimic the complex extracellular microenvironment where cells reside in the 3D tissues/organs in vivo. However, the conventional imaging techniques are difficult to achieve the dynamic and label-free monitoring of cellular behavior in thick sample by 3D cell culture. Here, 3D electric cell/matrigel-substrate impedance sensing (3D-ECMIS) is developed for real-time and non-invasive monitoring of 3D cell viability and drug susceptibility. In this study, human hepatoma cells (HepG2) are encapsulated in the matrigel scaffold and cultured in a 3D ECMIS chip which involves a pair of vertical golden electrodes on the opposite sidewalls of the culture chamber for the in-situ impedance measurement. Moreover, a portable multichannel system is developed to monitor the 3D cell/matrigel construct. The number of 3D-cultured cells was inversely proportional to the impedance magnitude of the entire cell/matrigel construct. Furthermore, anti-cancer drug screening will be conducted on the 3D-cultured cells when the cell proliferation reaches to a plateau phase. To validate the performance of 3D-ECMIS for the cell viability and drug susceptibility, the cell live/dead staining are utilized to confirm the results of drug susceptibility by this 3D-cell-based biosensor system. It is demonstrated that the 3D cell-based biosensor and 3D-ECMIS system will be a promising platform to improve the accuracy of cell-based anti-cancer drug screening in vitro.

AB In the field of label-free biosensing, various transducer materials and strategies are under investigation to overcome the Debye-screening limitation of charged biomolecules. We demonstrate an in-line, impedimetric aptasensor with reduced graphene-oxide (rGO) thin films as transducers to detect prostate specific antigens (PSA) in a physiological buffer solution. Unlike classical electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), this direct, label-free and fully-electronic biosensor approach does not need any redox markers. As specific capture molecules, short anti-PSA aptamers ensured a close binding of the target molecules to the transducer surfaces. Results showed a limit of detection smaller than 33 pM of PSA and a wide detection range from 0.033 to 330 nM fully covering the clinically relevant range of PSA (0.115-0.290 nM). This promising performance can be attributed to the bipolar electronic transport characteristics of the ultra-thin rGO layers similar to pristine graphene. The attachment of target biomolecules to the films changes the resistance of the rGO thin films. Such an in-line EIS configuration with rGO thin films opens promising prospects for biosensing beyond the Debye-screening limitation, which is a major challenge for conventional semiconductor field-effect devices towards clinical applications.

AB An optical communication type biosensor system has been developed which can measure blood glucose concentration, which is a stress indicator of fish, in real-time while fish swimming freely. However, this system is hard to make instant acknowledgment of fish stress level which has to contain an unavoidable delay in the judgment. In this research, we aimed to develop a novel stress visualization system which can quickly judge the levels for fish stress response instantly based on a color changeable LED while another LED was designed to send data. The present system is based on the principle of converting the output current value measured by the glucose biosensor corresponding to the stress response into a voltage value. Then, the color and stress switching points of the LED (Red, Yellow, Green) were decided based on the voltage value gained from the biosensor which mentioned above. Furthermore, we attempted to use our biosensor system to make real-time monitoring of fish stress in vivo. As results, the proposed sensor can make real-time measurement of glucose and shows a great response to those of actual fish sample in the range from 35.36 to 300 mg dl(-1) (R = 0.9899). When the glucose concentration in the collected sample was switched to the concentration pre-sett, it was successful to switch the LED color according to the gained voltage value both in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, when monitoring the stress responses of the fish in vivo, color switching corresponding to the sensor output current value was observed successfully.

AB Paper-based biosensors are promising for low-cost diagnostics. However, its widespread use has been hampered due to a lack of sensitive detection methods that can be easily implemented on paper substrates. On the other hand, single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) -based chemiresistive biosensors are gaining popularity as label-free, highly sensitive biosensors. However, traditional SWNT-based chemiresistors need to be more affordable for use in resource-limited settings. In this study, we report fabrication, optimization and analytical characterization of a chemiresistive biosensor on paper for label-free immunosensing. We synthesized a water-based ink using pyrene carboxylic acid (PCA) through non-covalent pi-pi stacking interaction between PCA and SWNTs. The PCA/SWNTs ink concentration can reach similar to 4 mg mL(-1) and was stable at room temperature for one month. We introduced a combination of wax printing and vacuum filtration to fabricate the hydrophilic channels and the well-defined PCA/SWNTs ink deposition on paper in a facile manner requiring no additional masks or stencils. Specific antibodies were then functionalized on the PCA/SWNTs. Quantitative and selective detection of human serum albumin (HSA) is demonstrated with a limit of detection (LOD) of 1 pM. This low LOD is attributed to the porous structure of the paper surface, which can accommodate more SWNTs. Furthermore, the hydroxyl group-containing cellulose fibers help connect the SWNTs into an electrical network. The paper -based chemiresistive biosensor proposed here is easy to fabricate, and designed for rapid, sensitive and selective detection of HSA. This work provides a potential platform for automated, disposable paper -based biosensors with multiplexed detection capability and microfluidic controls.

AB A small, standalone electrochemical hybrid sensor platform, combining flexible electronics and screen-printed electrodes, is demonstrated in the determination of capsaicin through adsorptive stripping voltammetry. The sensing scheme was simplified to be compatible with a low-cost device. The simplification involved eliminating the need for additional modification of the electrode and employing a coarsely stepped squarewave voltammetry, a technique which is applicable with less sophisticated instrumentation. This architecture was found to be suitable for concentrations up to at least 5000 mu M with a detection limit of 1.98 mu M. The screen-printed carbon graphite electrodes were made reusable through an ethanol rinsing protocol. The effect of ethanol/buffer volumetric ratio in the test sample was shown to greatly influence the analytical data, and a fixed 10% (v/v) was chosen as a compromise between signal-to-noise ratio and not exceeding the solubility limit of the desired upper range.

AB How to obtain sufficient functional olfactory receptors and coupled to transducers with high efficiency are crucial to biomimetic olfactory-based biosensors. In this study, a cell-free expression system was employed to prepare functional olfactory receptors that were utilized as sensitive elements for biomimetic olfactory receptor-based biosensors. A nematode olfactory receptor, ODR-10, was used as a model of olfactory receptors and expressed in Escherichia coli (E. coli) cell-free expression system. To improve the coupling efficiency and obtain the on-chip purification, a His(6)-tag was expressed as a fusion to ODR-10, which makes the expressed ODR-10 capable of selectively binding to the sensor surface modified with anti-His(6)-tag aptamers. Electrolyte-insulator-semiconductor (EIS) sensors were utilized as the transducer to measure the capacitance changes induced by the ODR-10 responding to its natural ligand, diacetyl. The results show that ODR-10 was successfully expressed using E. cob cell-free expression system and the expression could be promoted by adding 0.5% Brij58 as the detergent. Capacitance measurement results indicate that this olfactory receptor-based biosensor can detect diacetyl with high specificity and sensitivity. Concentration-dependent linear response to diacetyl ranging from 0.01 nM to 1 nM was obtained. The detection limit was as low as 0.01 nM. All the results demonstrated that the cell-free expression system provides a new approach for the preparation of functional olfactory receptors, which have great potential to be applied in biomimetic sensors towards chemical sensing.

AB A novel affinity paper-based electrochemical impedance device (PEID) was first fully developed for cardiovascular risk assessment. Herein, a simple folding PEID comprising a dual screen-printed electrode was fabricated for label-free electrochemical impedance detection. The results demonstrated in a step-wise manner that the phosphocholine-modified screen-printed carbon electrodes were highly responsive to the clinically required range of C-reactive protein (CRP) (0.005 - 500 mg L-1; r(2) = 0.993) levels with a detection limit (3 sigma/slope) of 0.001 mg L-1. The optimal binding frequency of CRP-phosphocholine interaction was determined to be 100 Hz. These results implied that our proposed system could be used for simultaneously measuring the CRP levels using a single PEID platform in combination with the specific recognition elements. When assaying two levels of CRP, the overall assay reproducibility for each concentration, expressed as relative standard error of the mean (RSE%; n = 30), was 1.21%. The variation in the measurements between individual electrodes, expressed as the relative standard deviation (RSD), was 2.82%. Using 2 measurement sites per device, the proposed sensor provided excellent precision for the simultaneous detection of CRP. Moreover, the RSD for the CRP levels measured on ten independently fabricated paper-based sheets was 2.11%, thereby offering an acceptable fabrication reproducibility. The presented folding PEIDs were used forthe determination of CRP in patient-derived blood samples with minimised bias and excellent correlation with a standard method (n = 15; CUSUM linearity test, p > 0.10), thus permitting the potential application of PEID for assessing cardiovascular risk in individuals.

AB The uniformity of the protein patterns, their shape, and the contrast between the fluorescence signal of the pattern and the background, critically modulate the quantitative accuracy of the microarray-derived data. While significant research focused of the identification of the factors that impact the protein microarray patterns, these studies usually have focused on the optimization of one set of these factors, e.g., how the spot uniformity is affected by different additives, or by different surfaces. However, the complex interaction between proteins, carrier fluids, surfaces, and patterning methodologies used would suggest a systematic and more comprehensive study that considers all these parameters, as well as their inter-relationship. The present work compared the patterning of two fluorescently-tagged proteins, i.e., IgG, BSA, on surfaces with different hydrophobicity and chemistry, and printed by inkjet, pin, and microcontact printing (mu CP). The quantification of the spot size regularity, its morphology, the signal intensity and its distribution within spots were used to assess the quality of a specific printing method, on a specific surface, with a specific solute of the printed protein. It was found that the optimal uniformity for both droplet-based methods depend on surface chemistry, with glass slides modified with 3-Glycidoxypropyl-dimethoxymethyl silane (GPS) and 3-(Aminopropyl)-triethoxy silane (APTES) exhibiting the greatest uniformity, while uniformity of the mu CP patterns was relatively independent of the surface chemistry. For the inkjet and pin printing, the largest fluorescence signal and contrast with the background was found on APTES modified glass slides, whereas for the mu CP the fluorescence signal increased with increasing hydrophilicity.

AB Easily fabricated random network carbon nanotube field-effect transistors (CNT-FETs) have benefitted from improved separation techniques to deliver CNTs with current formulations providing at least 99% semiconducting tube content. Amongst the most promising applications of this device platform are electronic biosensors, where the network conduction is affected through tethered probes such as aptamers which act as molecular scale electrostatic gates. However, the prevailing assumption that these biosensor devices would be optimized if metallic tubes were entirely eliminated has not been examined. Here, we show that metallic-semiconducting junctions in aptasensors are sensing hotspots and that their impact on sensing is heightened by the CNT network's proximity to percolation. First, we use a biased conducting AFM tip to gate a CNT-FET at the nanoscale and demonstrate that the strongest device response occurs when gating at metallic-semiconducting junctions. Second, we resolve the target sensitivity of an aptasensor as a function of tube density and show heightened sensitivity at densities close to the percolation threshold. We find the strongest sensing response where the 1% of metallic tubes generate a high density of metallic-semiconducting junctions but cannot form a percolated metallic path across the network. These findings highlight the critical role of metallic tubes in CNT-FET biosensor devices and demonstrate that network composition is an important variable to boost the performance of electronic biosensors.

AB The estimation of bloodstain age is an important factor in forensic analysis. Previously, we have reported a smartphone-based colorimetric system for age estimation of bloodstain, in which Whole blood and EDTA whole blood were dropped on 4 different materials (700 mu L) and captured using a smartphone for 72 h. In order to enhance sensitivity and accuracy of the previous system, the current work is dedicated towards the application of pattern recognition and classification of bloodstain images based on a smartphone. Three detection methods (blood pool, crack ratio, and colorimetric analysis) in terms of 6 steps of drying process of the bloodstain (coagulation, gelation, edge desiccation, center desiccation, crack propagation, and final desiccation) were applied to estimate age of the bloodstain accurately. Three parameters from the bloodstain images were then classified as comparing to those of stored reference images with similar trends in database. The bloodstain age was successfully determined by 9 h, 18 h, and 48 h with respect to the three detection methods mentioned above, respectively. The differences in bloodstain images were clearly distinguished every hour by using smartphone-based pattern recognition analysis. Therefore, our system is expected to shed a light on the field of forensic science by estimating bloodstain age in real time.

AB We developed a Complementary Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor Bio-Microelectromechanical Systems (CMOS-BioMEMS) based piezoresistive microcantilever sensor for detecting gentamicin, a peritonitis therapeutic small molecule drug. In recent years, the patient-centric concept has been emphasized. In such a trend, therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) is especially crucial for patients with peritonitis to avoid adverse reactions from a high concentration of gentamicin in the blood. With the aid of a commercialized semiconductor manufacturing process, the microcantilever sensing platform can serve as a portable, low-cost device and offer real-time detection. With chemical surface modification and capture antibody immobilization, the sensor can detect the small-molecule (< 2 kDa) gentamicin directly. We also modified the pH value of the buffer solution and applied an external electric field to promote sensor sensitivity. Comparing the change of the signals in a non-electric field of antibody immobilization and a 60-volt electric field of antibody immobilization showed that the average signal response increased 1.8 times. In the detection of gentamicin with different concentrations of 10-200 mu g/mL, the limit of detection (LOD) of the sensor was 9.44 mu g/mL. Finally, the detecting result of a microrcantilever sensor was compared with the one measured by a common instrument in hospital, and the high correlation was expressed between them in gentamicin detection. The CMOS-BioMEMS-based piezoresistive microcantilever sensor has been demonstrated to have great potential as a point-of-care (POC) device for real-time drug concentration monitoring.

AB A lable-free electrochemical aptasensor was successfully developed for the sensitive detection of carcinoembryonic antigen as a tumor biomarker. To do this, a ternary nanocomposite of hemin, graphene oxide and multi walled carbon nanotubes was used. The aptamer can be attached to the surface of a hemin, graphene oxide and multi-walled carbon nanotubes glassy carbon electrode through -NHCO- covalent bonds to form a sensing surface. Through fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy, it was indicated that hemin can be successfully incorporated into hemin, graphene oxide and multi-walled carbon nanotubes. Hemin, which protects graphene nanosheets, also serves as an in-situ probe owing to its well-defined redox properties. Multi-walled carbon nanotubes in the modifier enhance conductivity and facilitate the electron transfer between hemin and the glassy carbon electrode. In this study, carcinoembryonic antigen got specifically bound to the aptamer, and the current changes were used for selective and specific detection of that antigen. The devised aptasensor proved to have excellent performance with a wide linear range of 1.0 x 10(-15) - 1.0 x 10(-8) gmL(-1) and a detection limit of 0.82 fg mL(-1). The inter-day and intra-day values of RSD% were obtained in the range of 0.10-2.91 and 2.21-4.56 respectively. According to the experiments conducted on real samples, it may be claimed that the proposed label-free electrochemical aptasensor is capable enough of determining carcinoembryonic antigen in clinical diagnostics.

AB A novel amperometric genosensor based on PNA probes covalently bound on the surface of Single Walled Carbon Nanotubes - Screen Printed Electrodes (SWCNT-SPEs) was developed and validated in samples of non-amplified genomic DNA extracted from genetically modified (GM)-Soy. The sandwich assay is based on a first recognition of a 20-mer portion of the target DNA by a complementary PNA Capture Probe (CP) and a second hybridization with a PNA Signalling Probe (SP), with a complementary sequence to a different portion of the target DNA. The SP was labelled with biotin to measure current signal by means of a final incubation of an Alkaline Phosphatase-streptavidin conjugate (ALP-Strp). The electrochemical detection was carried out using hydroquinone diphosphate (HQDP) as enzymatic substrate. The genoassay provided a linear range from 250 pM to 2.5 nM, LOD of 64 pM and LOQ of 215 pM Excellent selectivity towards one base mismatch (1-MM) or scrambled (SCR) sequences was obtained. A simple protocol for extraction and analysis of non-amplified soybean genomic DNA without sample treatment was developed and validated. Our study provides insight into how the outstanding recognition efficiency of PNAs can be combined with the unique properties of CNTs in terms of signal response enhancement for direct detection of genomic DNA samples at the level of interest without previous amplification.

AB The synthesis and employment of volatile toxic compounds as chemical weapons with a large-scale destructive power has introduced a new insidious threat over the last century. In this framework, the development of wearable sensing tools represents a critical point within the security field, in order to provide early alarm systems. Herein, a novel wearable electrochemical biosensor was developed for the rapid and on-site detection of mustard agents. Since a chemical attack is typically carried out by spraying these volatile agents into air, the sensor was designed in order to be able to measure mustard agents directly in the aerosol phase, further than in the liquid phase. The electrodes were screen-printed onto a filter paper support, which allowed to harness the porosity of paper to pre-load all the needed reagents into the cellulose network, and hence to realise an origami like and reagent-free device. Mustard agent detection was carried out by monitoring their inhibitory effects toward the choline oxidase enzyme, through the amperometric measurement of the enzymatic by-product hydrogen peroxide. A carbon black/Prussian blue nanocomposite was used as a bulk-modifier of the conductive graphite ink constituting the working electrode, allowing for the electrocatalysis of the hydrogen peroxide reduction. After having verified the detecting capability toward a mustard agent simulant, the applicability of the resulting origami-like biosensor was demonstrated for the rapid and real-time detection of real sulfur mustard, obtaining limits of detection equal to 1 mM and 0.019 g.min/m(3) for liquid and aerosol phase, respectively.

AB The detection of urease activity in the oral cavity is considered to be an efficient way to prevent dental caries and also to screen for helicobacter pylori infection. Herein, a rapid surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) method is proposed to determine the activity of urease by using inositol hexaphosphate (IP6) stabilized silver nanoparticles (AgNPs@IP6) as an efficient SERS-active substrate. The determination was achieved by monitoring the SERS peak intensity of urea at 1003 cm(-1). With urease increase, the response of urea at 1003 cm-1 decreases gradually, indicating the two has good correlation. A linear relationship between the absolute value of signal drop and urease concentration is observed in a range from 2.35 to 37.5 mu g/mL. In addition, the rapid SERS method was used to evaluate the activity of urease in real sample of saliva without any pretreatment, exhibiting a promising potential for biomedical application.

AB A new bioelectronic nose based on a field effect transistor coupled with an aptamer as the sensing element was developed. The gas-to-liquid extraction interface required for appropriate aptamer function was integrated into standard CMOS technology. It was developed with the use of a sacrificial aluminium etching technique combined with surface modifications by silanes for wettability control. As a proof of concept, aptamer Van74 for vanillin was immobilized on the sensitive surface of the ISFET. The developed microsystem can selectively detect vanillin vapor in a concentration range from 2.7 ppt to 0.3 ppm, with a detection limit of 2.7 ppt. The sensor was able to detect vanillin in a gas sample obtained from roasted coffee beans. This outcome provides a foundation for developing a new generation of bioelectronic noses for the detection and discrimination of volatile compounds.

AB A simple and sensitive electrochemiluminescence (ECL) aptasensor has been developed for bisphenol A (BPA) detection. The capture DNA (CDNA) was modified on the heated indium-tin-oxide (ITO) working electrode surface firstly and then hybridized with BPA aptamer to form double strand DNA (dsDNA). The presence of target can cause the releasing of aptamer from the electrode surface since the aptamer prefers to switch its configuration to combine with BPA. Subsequently, the free CDNA will induce hybridization chain reaction (HCR) to produce long dsDNA on the electrode surface. Ru(phen)(3)(2+) can integrate into the grooves of dsDNA to act as an ECL reagent, thus enhanced ECL signal can be detected. The temperature control during the processes of target recognition and HCR were realized through the heated electrode instead of the bulk solution heating. Furthermore, the performance of the ECL aptasensor can be further enhanced at elevated electrode temperature. Under the optimized conditions, the ECL intensity of the system has a linear relationship with the logarithm of BPA concentration in the range of 2.0 pM-50 nM. The limit of detection (LOD) at 55 degrees C (electrode surface temperature) was calculated to be 1.5 pM, which was approximately 6.5-fold lower than that at 25 degrees C. The proposed biosensor has been applied to detect the BPA in drink samples with satisfactory results.

AB Based on multifunctionalized zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs)-initiated cascade reaction triggered signal amplification strategy, a novel sandwich-type amperometric immunosensor was constructed for ultrasensitive detection of carbohydrate antigen 24-2 (CA 242). The methylene blue-glucose oxidase-ZIF-8/reduced graphene oxide-Au (MB-GOx-ZIF-8/Au-rGO) was synthesized by a facile coprecipitation method for enzyme immobilization and redox species loading. The multifunctionalized ZIFs conjugated with labeling antibodies were employed as immunoprobe. In the presence of glucose, tandem reaction was driven by the immunoprobe to catalyze the glucose oxidation to yield H2O2. Simultaneously, the generated H2O2 induced the decomposition of poly(anilineboronicacid) (PABA)/poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) films on substrate, which made the PVA chains breaking away from PABA polymer. Due to the poor conductivity of PVA chains, this decomposition reaction can amplify the current signal. The current difference (AI) caused by per unit concentration target with tandem reaction amplification was elevated prominently, resulting in ultrasensitive analytical performance of the immunosensor. Under optimal conditions, the proposed immunosensor displayed wide linear range from 0.001 to 1000 U mL(-1) with an ultralow limit of detection 69.34 mu U mL(-1) (S/N = 3). This method successfully implemented functionalized ZIFs in immunoprobe construction for sensitivity amplification, providing a promising strategy to construct ultrasensitive immunosensing platform for analysis of other tumor marker.

AB Catalytic hairpin assembly (CHA) is a typical enzyme-free amplification strategy, in which the target can catalyze two hairpin probes to form a duplex and yield multiple outputs signal. However, the non-specific hybridization of two hairpin probes in CHA circuit usually occurred even in the absence of target, causing significant background leakage and impeding its practical applications in trace miRNA analysis. Herein, we proposed a novel heterogeneous CHA (hetero-CHA) design integrating with PDA microtube waveguide system, offering the advantages to enhance the target signal, but suppress the background leakage simultaneously. In hetero-CHA strategy, single-stranded targets are enriched nearby the surface of PDA microtube, facilitating the target-triggered CHA amplification and strand displacement reactions. In contrast, double-stranded DNA complexes formed by uncatalyzed hybridizations are isolated from PDA microtube, impeding the leakage signal. By combination with condensing enrichment effect, the proposed hetero-CHA probe exhibited high selectivity and sensitivity to miRNA target, giving a detection limit as low as 3.3 fM. More importantly, the proposed hetero-CHA probe can be applied directly to distinguish the expression of miRNA-21 in clinical serum of cancer patients (including lung, breast and pancreatic) from those of healthy human beings, favoring the cancer diagnosis and therapeutic evaluation.

AB Developing a simple and reliable method for the detection of the highly concerning mycotoxin, aflatoxin B1 (AFB1), is of great importance to food safety monitoring. In this study, a simple electrochemical aptasensor was presented for the detection of AFB1 based on the host-guest recognition between ferrocene and beta-cyclodextrin (beta-CD). Fc-labeled aptamer of AFB1 first hybridized with its complementary Fc-cDNA. Two ferrocene molecules were brought closely together and couldn't enter into the cavity of beta-CD modified on the electrode. Negligible signal could be observed. Once AFB1 captured the aptamer from the AFB1-sensitive dsDNA, Fc-cDNA was released and subsequently entered into the cavity of beta-CD to form inclusion complexes, giving rise to an distinct increase of Re, and peak current because of the molecular recognition of beta-CD. AC impedance method is more sensitive than DPV method. The electrochemical aptasensor displayed a sensitive response to AFB1 in a wide linear range of 0.1 pg/mL to 10 ng/mL, with a low detection limit of 0.049 pg/mL (0.147 pmol/mL) by AC impedance detection, which is 10-100 lower than previously reported methods. The aptasensor has good selectivity and reliability, which has been successfully applied to the determination of AFB1 in real peanut oil samples with recoveries ranging from 94.5% to 106.7% and inter-assay RSD lower than 11.51%.

AB In this study, a novel photoelectrochemical (PEC) aptasensor based on two-dimensional (2D) porphyrinic covalent organic frameworks (p-COFs) for the label-free detection of C-reactive protein (CRP) is presented. The obtained p-COFs possess high conductivity and an improved stability due to strong and rigid covalent linkages. The introduction of p-COFs hinder the recombination of electrons and holes, decreasing their band gap (E-g), thereby which improved the photocurrent conversion efficiency. Compared with pure porphyrin, p-COFs exhibited enhanced photocurrent intensity. An amplified photocurrent conversion efficiency and enhanced photocurrent results from H2O2, which act as active molecules and electron donors. As an unprecedented application of COFs in PEC bioanalysis, the detection of CRP with a PEC aptasensor is presented. The assembly of a CRP aptamer on the surface of Ag nanoparticles hinders the electron transfer, resulting in the decrease of the photocurrent response. This PEC aptasensor exhibits good analytical performances such as a rapid response, high stability, wide linear range and excellent selectivity, making COFs promising candidates for PEC bioanalysis.

AB The energy transfer efficiency, strongly depending on the distance of donor-acceptor pair, is always a crucial factor for the construction of elegant electrochemiluminescence resonance energy transfer (ECL-RET)-based biosensors. In this paper, a novel and efficient ECL-RET in 2D/2D heterostructured g-C3N4/MnO2 was developed using g-C3N4 nanosheets (g-C3N4 NSs) as energy donor and MnO2 nanosheets (MnO2 NSs) as energy acceptor. In this system, MnO2 NSs in-situ grew on g-C3N4 NSs to form the 2D/2D heterostructure, greatly shortening the distance of the donor-acceptor pair (g-C3N4-Mn02) and thus greatly enhancing the RET efficiency. To demonstrate the performance of the system, a signal "off-on" ECL sensor was designed for glutathione (GSH) analysis. In the absence of GSH, MnO2 significantly quenched the ECL intensity of g-C3N4 owing to ECL-RET in this 2D/2D g-C3N4/MnO2 heterostructure (ECL signal "off"). Upon the addition of GSH, MnO2 was reduced to Mn2+ by GSH and g-C3N4 was released from the heterostructured g-C3N4/MnO2, generating a recovery of ECL intensity (ECL signal "on"). Under the optimal conditions, the designed ECL-RET signal "off-on" sensor realized the sensitive detection of GSH ranged from 0.2-100 pM with the detection limit of 0.05 pM. Furthermore, the as prepared ECL-RET sensor exhibits good performance in the determination of GSH in human serum samples. The ECL-RET in 2D/2D heterostructure provides an ingenious way for the exploitation of novel ECL biosensing systems.

AB Bacterial endotcoxins such as lipopolysaccharides (LPS) are major contaminants of most pharmaceutical and consumer products. We report an antibiotic-mediated plasmonic biosensor for LPS detection based on a facile U-bent fiber optic probe (UFOP) technology. Biomimetic self-assembled layer of octadecyltrichlorosilanes (OTS) were functionalized on the surface of optical fiber probes to hydrophobically entrap LPS from aqueous solutions. The binding of LPS molecules was monitored in real-time by measuring the change in refractive index (RI) in the evanescent layer. To add specificity and signal amplification, the bound LPS molecules were further tagged with antimicrobial polymyxin-B conjugated gold nanoparticles (PMB-AuNPs) in a sandwich format. The assay was extensively optimized by investigating the role of experimental parameters like OTS concentration, incubation time and addition of a silver reduction step at the end of the assay. The lower limit of detection (LOD) for LPS was found to be 0.4 ng/mL with a 36-fold improved sensitivity upon silver enhancement. The total assay time was 1 h. The assay was also found to be highly specific in the presence of common biopharmaceutical components and could thus serve as an efficient endotoxin detection platform for quality control testing during therapeutic development.

AB A simple, sensitive, quantitative point-of-care testing (POCT) was developed integrating enzyme-linked DNA supersandwich amplification with optical fiber amplifier. The point-of-care (POC) assay can work in both "Turn-off" mode and "Turn-on" mode. Using myoglobin (Myo) and miRNA-141 as the model biomarker, as low as 0.5 nM Myo and 10 pM miRNA-141 could be detected. More importantly, the optical fiber amplifier, which was used as signal readout, exhibited low-cost, small size, rapid response, and easy operation. Although it did not need large equipment and professional technical personnel, the assay was successfully applied to detect Myo and miRNA-141 in 40% human serum. Since the entire process of the strategy could be done directly in the centrifugal tube, requiring a few easy steps, it showed great potential application for early diagnosis in the world, especially in developing countries or remote regions. This work provided a new avenue for developing the portable and sensitive biosensor.

AB Label-free electronic biosensors as the non-electrochemical analytical tools without requirement of sophisticated instrumentation have become attractive, although their application in competitive affinity sensing of uncharged small molecules is still hindered by a difficulty in the development of competing analogues. To break through this bottleneck, we report a novel analogue made by epitope-modified metal nanoparticles to enable the electronic signaling of small-molecule analyte recognition via competitive affinity. While the electronic signaling capability of metal nanoparticle analogues is demonstrated by a graphene field-effect transistor bioassay of small-molecule glucose as a proof-of-principle, interestingly, we discover a new electronic signaling mechanism in the metal nanoparticle affinity, different to the intuitive charge accumulation expectation. On the basis of Kelvin-probe force microscopic potential characterization and theoretical discussion, we fundamentally elucidated the signaling mechanism as a seldom used electrostatic shielding-effect, that is, in the analogue-receptor affinity, metal nanoparticles with the charge density lower than receptor biomolecules can reduce the collective electrical potential via charge dispersion. Further consider the convenient epitope-modifiability of metal nanoparticles, the easy-to-develop analogues for diverse target analyte might potentially be predictable in the future. And the application of label-free electronic biosensors for the competitive affinity bioassay of range extended small molecules may thus be promoted based on the electrostatic shielding-effect.

AB A dual gears electrochemiluminecence (ECL) aptasensing strategy for multiple selective determination of kanamycin and neocycin was designed on the basis of the combination of kanamycin and neocycin induced dual gears conversion, the loading platform of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), surface plasmon resonance (SPR) and ECL resonance energy transfer (ERET) between CdS QDs and AuNPs (or PtNPs). In the absence of target, the dual gears were "off". Then the Bl-AuNP (gear B) and aptamer 1-PtNPs acted as signal quenching elements to quench ECL intensity due to ERET process. Upon addition of kanamycin, the aptamer 1-PtNPs were removed from the gear gradually, the ECL was enhanced due to SPR process between AuNPs and CdS QDs. After the incubation of aptamer 2, the dual gears were "off' again and ECL intensity was decreased by ERET process between AuNPs and CdS QDs. In the presence of neomycin, dual gears were "on" again, the ECL signal was enhanced by SPR process between AuNPs and CdS QDs. Under optimal condition, the proposed aptasensor exhibited wide linear ranges of kanamycin (10(-10)-10(-6) M) and neomycin (10(-9)-10(-5) M), and relatively low detection limits to kanamycin (1.7 x 10(-11) M) and neomycin (3.5 x 10(-10) M). The developed aptasensor realized the multiple ECL detection of kanamycin and neomycin with single luminophore, and was successfully applied to the detection of kanamycin and neomycin in food samples.

AB As an efficient tool in the multiplexed detection of biomolecules, bead-array could achieve separation-free detection to multiple targets, making it suitable to analyze valuable and scarce samples like antigen and antibody from living organism. Herein, we propose a spectral-optical-tweezer-assisted fluorescence multiplexing system to analyze biomolecule-conjugated bead-array. Using optical tweezer, we trapped and locked beads at the focus to accept stimulation, offering a stable and optimized analysis condition. Moving the system focus and scanning the sample slide, we achieved emissions collection to QDs-encoded bead-array after the multiplexed detection. The emission spectra of fluorescence were collected and recorded by the spectrometer. By recognizing locations of decoding peaks and counting the intensities of label signals of emission spectra, we achieved qualitative and quantitative detection to targets. As proof-of-concept studies, we use this system to carry out multiplexed detection to various types of anti-IgG in the single sample and the detection limit reaches 1.52 pM with a linear range from 0.31 to 10 nM. Through further optimization of experimental conditions, we achieved specific detection to target IgG with sandwich method in human serum and the detection limit reaches as low as 0.23 pM with a linear range from 0.88 to 28 pM, validating the practical application of this method in real samples.

AB The integrating of high fluorescent quenching capability of two-dimensional nanomaterials with dye-labelled ssDNA as nanoprobes has attracted increasing interest for biosensing applications. However, this absolute intensity -dependent single fluorescent signal may be influenced by target concentration-independent factors. To overcome this challenge, a ratiometric nanoprobe was developed by utilizing green fluorescent phenyl-doped carbon nitride (PDCN) nanosheets as an internal reference and quenching platform. 5-carboxy-X-rhodaminelabelled anti-adenosine aptamer was used as a signal probe. PDCN nanosheets quenched the fluorescence of the absorbed signal probe while kept their own fluorescence constantly. Upon addition of adenosine, the formation of adenosine-aptamer complexes led to desorption of the signal probe from the surface of PDCN nanosheets, resulted in the fluorescent recovery of the signal probe. The ratio of the fluorescent enhancement of the signal probe to the inherent fluorescence of PDCN nanosheets was used to quantitatively measure adenosine. The limit of detection for adenosine was 6.86 mu M. Finally, the ratiometric nanoprobe was applied to determine adenosine in serum samples.

AB A novel and sensitive sandwich-type photoelectrochemical (PEC) immunosensor was developed for the quantitative detection of beta-amyloid protein (A beta). A ITO electrode was sequentially coated with hierarchical porous zinc oxide (ZnO) microspheres with a large specific area, sensitized with tris(bipyridine)ruthenium(II) ion (Ru (bpy)(3)(2+)) to achieve high visible light absorption, and modified with cerium-doped cadmium sulfide (Ce-CdS) nanoparticles to enhance the PEC response. Under the stimulation of visible light and ascorbic acid as an efficient electron donor, the photoelectric signal of ZnO/Ru(bpy)(3)(2+)/Ce-CdS was 70 times that of pure ZnO. The aminofunctionalized polystyrene (PS) microspheres coated with copper sulfide (CuS) was linked with a secondary antibody (Ab(2)) for the first time for the AP detection by the immunosensor. The good insulation and steric resistance of the as-prepared polystyrene@CuS-Ab(2) (PS@CuS-Ab(2)) composite significantly weakened the photocurrent response of the immunosensor in the specific immune recognition. Under the optimal conditions, the quantitative detection of A beta was achieved within the range of 0.001-100 ng/mL with the detection limit of 0.37 pg/mL. In addition, the PEC immunosensor is easy to make, stable and selective, which has provided a good experimental platform for the detection of disease biomarkers.

AB The redox balance in cellular mitochondria is closely related to the physiological and pathological processes of the body. When exposed to external stimuli, the redox state in cells changes dynamically, and presents cell heterogeneity, which creates a need for techniques that can make dynamic and reversible visual analysis of redox in mitochondria at single-cell level. Here we describe a method for single-cell redox analysis based on a microfluidic device combing with a reversible fluorescent probe (Cy-O-ebselen), that enables online culture, labelling and dynamic fluorescent imaging analysis of mitochondrial redox (H2O2/GSH) change. Using this method, we further explored the dynamic changes of mitochondrial redox state after thermal stimulation or combined thermal-drug stimulation, and analysed the heterogeneous response of cells to external stimuli at the single cell level.

AB Low molecular weight pollutants from foods have aroused global attention due to their toxicity after long-time exposure. There is an increased demand for appropriate methods to detect these pollutants in foods. In this study, a brand-new type of nano metal organic coordination polymers (MOCPs) nanocarriers (3D sakura-shaped copper (II) ions@L-glutamic acid (L-Glu)) has been first synthesized. We herein demonstrate a facile chelated method that allows the combination of copper (II) ions and L-Glu. A series of controlled experiments have revealed that the reaction time and the ratio of reactants played the crucial roles in affecting the morphology of the final product. 3D sakura-shaped Cu@L-Glu combined with palladium-platinum nanoparticle (Pd-PtNPs) to obtain Cu@L-Glu/Pd-PtNPs acting as the signal tag, which applied in electrochemical aptasensor for ultra sensitive detection of zearalenone (ZEN). A glassy carbon electrode was first modified with spherical Au-PANIAu nanohybrids to enhance the conductivity and immobilize more amino modified ZEN aptamer. Cu@L-Glu/Pd-PtNPs were labeled with Complementary DNA (partial matching with ZEN aptamer) to form bioconjugates for signal amplification. After the hybridization reaction of ZEN aptamer and the bioconjugates, a significant electrochemical signal from the catalysis of H2O2 by Cu@L-Glu/Pd-PtNPs can be observed. ZEN competed with bioconjugates for binding to ZEN aptamer, resulting in decreased the electrochemical signal. Chronoamperometry was applied to record the final electrochemical signals. Under optimal conditions, the electrochemical aptasensor exhibited desirable sensitive detection of ZEN with a wide linearity ranging from 1 fg/mL to 100 ng/mL and a relatively low detection limit of 0.45 fg/mL (S/N = 3). Furthermore, the proposed electrochemical aptasensor shows excellent selectivity to the ZEN in the presence of possible interfering substances, and has potential application for ZEN detection in food samples.

AB Deep Vein Thrombosis and pulmonary embolism (DVT/PE) is one of the most common causes of unexpected death for hospital in-patients. D-dimer is used as a biomarker within blood for the diagnosis of DVT/PE. We report a low-cost microfluidic device with a conveniently biofunctionalised interdigitated electrode (IDE) array and a portable impedimetric reader as a point-of-care (POC) device for the detection of D-dimer to aid diagnosis of DVT/PE. The IDE array elements, fabricated on a polyethylenenaphtalate (PEN) substrate, are biofunctionalised in situ after assembly of the microfluidic device by electropolymerisation of a copolymer of polypyrrole to which is immobilised a histidine tag anti-D-Dimer antibody. The most consistent copolymer films were produced using chronopotentiometry with an applied current of 5 mu A for a period of 50 s using a two-electrode system. The quality of the biofunctionalisation was monitored using optical microscopy, chronopotentiometry curves and impedimetric analysis. Measurement of clinical plasma sample with a D-dimer at concentration of 437 ng/mL with 15 biofunctionalised IDE array electrodes gave a ratiometric percentage of sample reading against the blank with an average value of 124 +/- 15 at 95% confidence. We have demonstrated the concept of a low cost disposable microfluidic device with a receptor functionalised on the IDE array for impedimetric detection towards POC diagnostics. Changing the receptor on the IDE array would allow this approach to be used for the direct detection of a wide range of analytes in a low cost manner.

AB Certain blood-borne biomarkers offer a potent methodology for understanding the risk of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) with clinicians generally advocating the use of multiple biomarkers for proper risk assessment of CVDs. Herein four such CVDs biomarkers- C-reactive protein (CRP), N-terminal pro b-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), cardiac troponin I (cTnI), and fibrinogen- were rapidly (5 min) analyzed from clinical samples (similar to 4 mu L) on an integrated microfluidic platform equipped with 1) immobilized highly specific aptamer probes and 2) field-effect transistor (FET)-based sensor arrays. The calibration curve from the FET sensor arrays showed good agreement in the physiological concentration ranges for CRP (0.1-50 mg/L), NT-proBNP (50-10,000 pg/mL), cTnI (1-10,000 pg/mL), and fibrinogen (0.1-5 mg/mL). The developed prototype of this fully automated portable device requires minimal reagent and sample inputs and consequently shows great promise for next-generation point-of-care devices assaying multiple CVDs biomarkers in clinical samples.

AB Biosensors have been commonly used in biomedical diagnostic tools in recent years, because of a wide range of application, such as point-of-care monitoring of treatment and disease progression, drug discovery, commonly use food control, environmental monitoring and biomedical research. Additionally, development of DNA biosensors has been increased enormously over the past few years as confirmed by the large number of scientific publications in this field. A wide range of techniques can be used for the development of DNA biosensors, such as DNA nano-machines and various signal amplification strategies. This article selectively reviews the recent advances in DNA base biosensors with various signal amplification strategies for detection of cancer DNA and microRNA, infectious microorganisms, and toxic metal ions.

AB White blood cells (WBCs) isolated from peripheral blood have been verified as important biomarkers for the diagnosis, treatment and prognosis of cancer. However, it's still under challenge to acquire high-purity WBCs, even by taking advantage of current microfluidic technology. Considering the universality of clinical magnetic activated cell sorting (MACS) method, new developments on microfluidic chip in combination of magnetic cells separation technologies may provide a fascinating approach for high-purity WBCs sorting and widely clinical application. Here, we present a flyover style microfluidic chip which has been elaborately embedded with two stage magnetic separation in continuous flow for WBCs sorting. Immunomagnetic micro/nano-particles (IMNPs) labeled WBC (WBC@IMNPs) were sequentially separated by a lateral magnetic force and a vertical magnetic force, and the final separation purity of WBCs reached up to 93 +/- 1.67% at a flow rate of 20 mu L min(-1). Furthermore, the WBCs viability was up to 97.5 1.8%. Consequently, this novel flyover style microfluidicchip with magnetic separation technology has been successfully demonstrated as cut-in-edge method for high purity WBCs sorting, and obviously it's easy to extend for other types of cells sorting under great potential application in biomedical fields.

AB Beta thalassemias (beta th) are the result of mutations in the beta-globin gene. In this report, an electrochemical genosensor was made to detect the sequences anent with the beta-globin gene. This biosensor is based on immobilizing 20-mer single stranded oligonucleotide (probe) on the Au nanoparticles-poly (4-aminothiophenol)/ reduced graphene oxide/glassy carbon electrode (AuNPs-PAT/rG0/GCE) and hybridizing this oligonucleotide along with its complementary sequence (target). The vastness of the probe and target sequences hybridization was studied through differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) along with electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) using the [Fe(CN)6](3-)/(4-)(1:1) as a hybridization index. The biosensor indicated great efficiency with significant sensitivity along with favorable selectivity. The DPV and EIS responses with the intended concentrations of the sequence were linear varying from 1.0 pM to 400.0 pM (I-p v log C) and 0.5-400.0 pM (Delta R-ct v log C) with a limit of detection of 0.06 pM and 0.035 pM, at the signal to noise ratio of 3 sigma. The biosensor of the DNA indicated proper discrimination capability to mismatched two-base, three-base, and non-complementary sequences.

AB Faradaic electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (faradaic EIS) is an attractive measurement principle for biosensors. However, there have been no reports on sensors employing direct electron transfer (DET)-type redox enzymes based on faradaic EIS principle. In this study, we have attempted to construct the 3rd-generation faradaic enzyme EIS sensor, which used DET-type flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) dependent glucose dehydrogenase (GDH) complex, to elucidate its characteristic properties as well as to investigate its potential application as the future immunosensor platform. The gold disk electrodes (GDEs) with DET-type FADGDH prepared using self-assembled monolayer (SAM) showed the glucose concentration dependent impedance change, which was confirmed by the change in the charge transfer resistance (R-ct). The Delta(1/R-ct) values were also affected by DC bias potential and the length of SAM. Based on the Nyquist plot and Bode plot simulations, glucose sensing by imaginary impedance monitoring under fixed frequency (5 mHz) was carried out, revealing the higher sensitivity at low glucose concentration with wider linear range (0.024-0.2 mM). Considering this high sensitivity toward glucose, the 3rd-generation faradaic enzyme EIS sensor would provide alternative platform for future impedimetric immunosensing system, which does not use redox probe.

AB Bacteria adhering to implanted medical devices can cause invasive microbial infections, of e.g. skin, lung or blood. In dentistry, Streptococcus gordonii is an early oral colonizer initiating dental biofilm formation and also being involved in life-threatening infective endocarditis. To treat oral biofilms, antibacterial mouth rinses are commonly used. Such initial biomaterial-bacteria interactions and the influence of antibacterial treatments are poorly understood and investigated here in situ by quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring (QCM-D). A saliva-coated titanium (Ti) biosensor is applied to analyze possible specific signal patterns indicating microbial binding mechanisms and bactericide-caused changes in bacterial film rigidity or cell leakage caused by a clinically relevant antibacterial agent (ABA), i.e., a mouth rinse comprising chlorhexidine (CHX) and cetylpyridinium chloride (CPC). Apparent missing mass effects during the formation of microscopically proven dense and vital bacterial films indicate punctual, specific binding of S. gordonit to the saliva-coated biosensor, compared to unspecific adhesion to pure Ti. Coincidentally to ABA-induced killing of surface-adhered bacteria, an increase of adsorbed dissipative mass can be sensed, contrary to the prior mass-loss. This suggests the acoustic sensing of the leakage of cellular content caused by bacterial cell wall rupturing and membrane damage upon the bactericidal attack. The results have significant implications for testing bacterial adhesion mechanisms and cellular integrity during interaction with antibacterial agents.

AB Multielectrode array (MEA) technology is widely used for the bioelectronic monitoring of cellular alterations. In general, noble metal based MEAs are preferred e.g. for impedance spectroscopy because of their high conductivity and biocompatibility. Today's research focuses on combining different readout methods in a single measurement setup, such as sensitive electronic and optical readouts, where noble metal-based electrodes are excluded and transparent electrodes and optimized MEAs are required. In this context, we used optical transparent indium tin oxide (ITO) as electrode material. As a drawback, the decreased conductivity can lead to drastically decreased cell signals and it is hardly to predict which layout changes lead to a substantial signal increase. To overcome this limitation, we introduce an approach where equivalent circuit modelling (ECM) on reference multielectrode arrays is used to determine cell type specific electrical parameters, which then are used in finite element method (FEM) simulations to predict achievable cell signals and signal-noise-ratios (SNR) and thus use simulation to efficiently optimize multielectrode arrays.
   To evaluate our approach, MEAs with a wide range of electrode sizes were fabricated with ITO and gold. HEKA cells were used to compare achievable cell signals for impedimetric monitoring. Our study revealed that especially for large ITO electrodes, the sensitivity drastically decreases. To overcome this drawback, we designed an optimized dual layer ITO MEA with gold support structures and more strikingly, successfully predict the cell signal increase by using our combined ECM and FEM simulation based approach.

AB Parkinson's disease caused by lack of dopamine in brain is a common neurodegenerative disorder. The traditional treatment is to replenish levodopa since it could pass through blood brain barrier and form dopamine. However, its accumulation can cause patients' movement disorders and uncontrollable emotion. Therefore, it is critical to control the levodopa dosage accuracy to improve the curative effect in clinical. In this study, a smartphone-based electrochemical detection system was developed for rapid monitoring of levodopa. The system involved a disposable sensor, a hand-held electrochemical detector, and a smartphone with designed application. Single-wall carbon nanotubes and gold nanoparticles modified screen-printed electrodes were used to convert and amplify the electrochemical current signals upon presence of levodopa molecules. The electrochemical detectors were used to generate electrochemical excitation signals and detect the resultant currents. Smartphone was connected to the detector, which was used to control the detector, calculate data, and plot graph in real-time. The smartphone-based differential pulse amperometry system was demonstrated to monitor levodopa at concentrations as low as 0.5 uM in human serum. Furthermore, it has also been verified to be able to distinguish levodopa from other representative substances in the body. Therefore, its performance was more sensitive and rapid than electrochemical workstation. With these advantages, the system can be used in the field of point-of-care testing (POCT) to detect levodopa and provide the possibility to solve clinical demand for levodopa detection.

AB Foodborne salmonellosis remains a major economic burden worldwide and particularly for food industries. The diverse and complexity of food matrices pose great challenges for rapid and ultra-sensitive detection of Salmonella in food samples. In this study, combination of pathogen pre-concentration with rapid molecular identification is presented to overcome these challenges. This combination enabled effective real-time PCR detection of low levels of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium without culture enrichment. Anti-salmonella antibody, immobilized on protein AG-magnetic beads, could efficiently concentrate Salmonella Typhimurium with a capturing efficiency of 95%. In the direct PCR, a strong linear relationship between bacteria concentration and the number of cycles was observed with a relative PCR efficiency of 92% resulting in a limit of detection (LoD) of 2 CFU/mL. Analysis of spiked food samples that include vegetable salad, egg yolk, egg white, whole egg and minced pork meat has validated the precision of the method. A relative accuracy of 98.3% with a sensitivity of 91.6% and specificity of 100% was achieved in the Salmonella spiked food samples. The use of a Phusion hot start DNA polymerase with a high tolerance to possible PCR inhibitors allowed the integration of direct PCR, and thereby reducing the duration of analysis to less than 3 h. The Cohen's kappa index showed excellent agreement (0.88) signifying the capability of this method to overcome the food matrix effects in rapid and ultra-sensitive detection of Salmonella in food. This approach may lay a future platform for the integration into a Lab-on-a-chip system for online monitoring of foodborne pathogens.

AB Early screening of gastric cancer is a critical importance for the improvement of patients' survival rate. Here, a polyethylene coating Lamb (PE-Lamb) microfluidic device with immune layer for gastric cancer label-free detection was constructed. Two serum pepsinogen 1 (PG1) and pepsinogen 2 (PG2) biomarkers were applied to screen and predict the appearance of gastric cancer. Compared with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), this method achieved a higher sensitivity and less time (40 min vs 120 min). The limit of detections (LOD) were reached 60 pg/mL for PG1 and 30 pg/mL for PG2, which have two orders of magnitude lower than traditional ELISA. The linearity coefficient indexes (R-2) for PG1 and PG2 were 0.992 and 0.953 respectively, which is similar to that of ELISA. In addition, PG1 and PG2 mixed antigens sample with human serum was detected by PE-Lamb approach, and the frequency response showed high reproducibility and specificity. The results indicate that PE-lamb diagnostic technique is a novel and promising method for high-throughput screening and early diagnosis of gastric cancer.

AB Driven by the growing need of simple, cost efficient and flexible sensing systems, we have designed here a fully printed Reduced Graphene Oxide (rGO) based impedimetric sensor for one step sensing of DNA. The DNA sensor was fabricated by stamping of layered rGO and rGO/gold nanoparticles/single stranded DNA (rGO/AuNPs/ssDNA) composites over PET substrates using wax-printing technique. rGO works as an excellent working electrode, while the AuNPs create a suitable environment for ssDNA immobilization. Counter and reference electrodes were previously screen-printed on the plastic substrate, making thus a compact and highly integrated sensing platform. The change in electron transfer resistance after hybridization with a target ssDNA specific of Coxsackie B3 virus was monitored using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), finding a linear response in the range of concentrations 0.01-20 M. The novel, simple and straightforward one-step printing process for fabrication of a biosensing device developed keeps in mind the growing need of large scale device manufacturing. The successful proof-of-concept for the detection of DNA hybridization can be extended to other affinity biosensors, taking advantage of the integration of the bioreceptor on the sensor surface. Such ready-to use biosensor would lead to a one-step electrochemical detection.

AB In this study, a highly sensitive and selective biochemical gas sensor (bio-sniffer) and real-time monitoring system with skin gas cell was constructed for the determination of ethanol gas concentration on human skin. This bio-sniffer measured the concentration of ethanol according to the change in fluorescence intensity of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH), which is produced in an enzymatic reaction by alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH). The NADH detection system used an ultraviolet light emitting diode (UV-LED) as the excitation light, and a highly sensitive photomultiplier tube as a fluorescence intensity detector. The calibration range of the ethanol bio-sniffer was validated from 25 ppb to 128 ppm. To measure the concentration of ethanol within skin gas, subjects ingested an alcohol beverage, and the sensor output was monitored. We chose the central part of the palm, a back of the hand, and a wrist as targets. The real-time concentration of skin ethanol gas at each target was measured after drinking. The maximum output values were reached at approximately 70 min after drinking and then gradually decreased. We showed that ethanol release kinetics were different depending on the part of the hand measured with the developed monitoring system. Accordingly, this highly sensitive and selective biosniffer with a skin gas cell could be used to measure ethanol on the skin surface and could be applied for breath and skin gas research, as well as investigation of volatile blood compounds used as biomarkers for clinical diagnosis.

AB Haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) is a significant glycaemic marker for diabetes mellitus. The level of HbA1c reflects the mean blood glucose level over the prior 2-3 months and it is useful for the assessment of therapeutic effectiveness and for diagnosis. In this study, we report the label-free affinity sensor for HbA1c based on the chemiresistor-type field-effect transistor, which has a simple sensor configuration. Single-walled carbon nano tubes (SWNTs) were used as the transducing element. The fructosyl amino acid binding protein from Rhizobiwn radiobacter (SocA), which binds to a-fructosyl amino acid specifically, was used as the biorecognition element for fructosyl valine (FV), the product of the proteolytic hydrolysis of HbA1c. The developed sensor shows the ability to measure as low as L2 nM FV, which is 14-fold more sensitive compared to the previously reported fluorescence -based sensor using SocA. This sensor also exhibits high specificity where no significant response is observed from either fructosyl lysine (FK) or glucose, which are potential interferents. FK is the alpha-fructosyl amino acid from glycated albumin, another glycated protein, whereas glucose is naturally present at very high concentration in the blood. We propose that the modulation of the surface charges on the SWNTs caused by the conformational change in SocA upon ligand binding leads to the proportionate changes in the number of carriers in the SWNT channel.

AB During space missions, real-time monitoring of astronauts' health status is of crucial importance and therefore there is a strong demand for simple analytical devices that astronauts can use to perform clinical chemistry analyses directly onboard.
   As part of the "IN SITU Bioanalysis" project, we designed a biosensor for analysing salivary levels of cortisol in astronauts, a marker of chronic stress. The biosensor is based on the Lateral Flow Immunoassay (LFIA) approach coupled with chemiluminescence (CL) detection and comprises a 3D-printed plastic cartridge containing a sealed fluidic element with the LFIA strip, in which the flow of sample and reagents is activated by pressing buttons on the cartridge and sustained by exploiting capillary forces. For measurement, the photon emission is imaged employing a CL reader based on an ultrasensitive cooled charge-coupled device (CCD) camera.
   The payload was designed to operate in microgravity and to withstand mechanical stress, such as take-off vibrations, and onboard depressurization events, while the microfluidics was developed considering alterations of physical phenomena occurring in microgravity, such as bubble formation, surface wettability and liquid evaporation. The biosensor, which was successfully used by the Italian astronaut Paolo Nespoli during the VITA mission (July-December 2017), demonstrated the feasibility of performing sensitive LFIA analysis of salivary cortisol down to 0.4 ng/mL directly onboard the International Space Station. It could be easily adapted for the analysis of other clinical biomarkers, thus enabling the early diagnosis of diseases and the timely activation of appropriate countermeasures.

AB Traditional methods for detection of metabolically-active bacterial cells, while effective, require several days to complete. Development of sensitive electrical biosensors is highly desirable for rapid detection and counting of pathogens in food, water, or clinical samples. Herein, we develop a highly-sensitive non-Faradaic impedance sensor which detects metabolic activity of E. coil cells in a mere 1 mu l of sample volume and without any sample filtration/purification. The three dimensional (3D) interdigitated electrodes (IDEs) along with self-assembled gold-nickel (Au-Ni) nanostructures significantly amplify the sensitivity by increasing the sensing area almost three-fold. The developed microsystem is integrated with an agar-based growth medium and monitors the metabolism of bacterial cells, enabling bacterial detection in approximately one hour after inoculation, i.e. in the lag-phase. Incorporation of a secondary agar layer as a biocompatible passivation layer protects the IDEs from potential Faradaic reactions and enhances sensitivity to modulation of the non-Faradaic impedance due to cellular metabolism. The resultant label-free sensor is capable of selective identification of metabolizing cells (vs. dead cells) across a wide linear range (10-1000 cells/mu l). These results help pave the way for rapid antibacterial susceptibility testing at the point-of-need, which is currently a major challenge in healthcare.

AB The electrochemical detection methods have emerged as a potential alternative to the bench-top optical systems in monitoring nucleic acid amplification. DNA intercalating redox reporters play a crucial role in such monitoring schemes. Here, a series of bisintercalating redox probes have been tailor-made to meet specific requirements of electrochemical quantitative loop-mediated isothermal amplification (gLAMP). The probes composed of two naphthoquinone-imidazole (NQIM) derivatives as signal motifs that are covalently bridged by different linkers (R). They are bis-NQIM-R; R = Alkane (Ak), ethylene glycol (EG) and phenyl (Ph). The linkers allow the probes to be fine-tuned for securing ideal redox reporter. DNA binding studies via electrochemical and fluorescence techniques demonstrate that the bis-NQIM-R probes possess better ds-DNA bisintercalating ability compared to their mono-analogs. The bis-NQIM-Ph was implemented in a real-time electrochemical qLAMP, for which a prototype custom-made device that can perform fully automated multiplexed analyses is devised. A single copy of Salmonella DNA was quantified in just 10 min and the performance is comparable to the benchtop fluorescence method. Thus, the bisintercalating redox reporters incorporated electrochemical detection schemes hold great promise in qLAMP.

AB Silica nanopores have electron channels and ion channels interpenetrating each other, which prompt the use of this structure for creating efficient electronic devices. In this study, silica nanopores membrane modified screen printed electrodes were applied in a smartphone-based electrochemiluminescence system for nitroaromatic explosives detection. Universal serial bus-on the go (USB-OTG) and camera on smartphone were used as the electrical stimulation and luminescence capture, respectively. square Multimode methods including (red-green-blue) RGB, (hue-saturation-brightness) HSB, and Gray were proposed for luminescence analysis. Specific polypeptides were immobilized on the nanopores modified electrodes for nitroaromatic explosives sensing. With positive charged tris(2,2'-bipyridyl)ruthenium(II) (Ru(bpy)(3)(2+)) as electrochemiluminescence label, the increase in luminescence was associated with the selective ion channels and the well-conductive electron channels in the negative-charged nanopores. Besides, on account of the large specific surface area, nanopores modified screen printed electrodes showed stable and uniform luminescence. Results showed that the nanopores-enhanced electrochemiluminescence on smartphone covered a linear dynamic range from 10(-7) mg/mL to 10(-3) mg/mL for nitroaromatic explosives detection with the detection limit of 2.3 x 10(-9) mg/mL. Therefore, high-efficient photo-electricity conversion capabilities of nanopores made it a kind of promising platform for sensitive and stable electrochemiluminescence. Furthermore, smartphone-based electrochemiluminescence with disposable screen printed electrodes could facilitate the mobile monitoring of biochemical analytes in the fields of environment, security, and health.

AB Cell culture assays for therapeutic drug screening today are fully automated. Vitality of the cells is monitored by different sensors. For such a system, we propose a new reader unit, which is capable of reading two different fluorescent sensors and electrical impedance in 24-well-plates. Main goals are to reduce cost, complexity and size while achieving a similar performance as the existing reader unit. To achieve this, measurement electronics and signal paths for frequency domain fluorescence and bio-impedance measurement are combined. Central component is an integrated circuit for impedance spectroscopy. A new compact and economic optical setup is developed to read two different sensor spots on the bottom of the well. Measurement errors introduced by different components like DFT leakage, and frequency dependent signal delays are evaluated and compensated. A set of commercially available fluorescence sensor spots is used to verify the read out performance. The results are usable, with noise slightly higher than commercial readers. To verify the impedance measurement accuracy, measurements of known resistances are conducted. In the relevant impedance and frequency range for biological applications a suitable accuracy is achieved. Due to the higher sampling rate of the new reader, the higher noise can be reduced through averaging. The new system is significantly smaller and cheaper to manufacture than commercially available devices.

AB The present work describes an ultrasensitive electrochemical sensor for determination of mercury(II) using deoxyribonucleic acid/poly-L-methionine-gold nanoparticles/pencil graphite electrode (DNA/PMET-AuNPs/PGE). To fabricate this biosensor, L-methionine (L-MET) was electropolymerized on the PGE surface followed by simultaneous electrochemical entrapment of AuNPs. Next, DNA was immobilized on the PMET-AuNPs/PGE by applying a 0.5 V potential. The surface area of modified and unmodified electrodes was determined by chronocoulometric technique. Hg2+ was detected in the linear dynamic range of 0.1 aM to 0.1 nM, and the detection limit was determined as 0.004 aM using square wave anodic stripping voltammetry (SWASV) under optimized conditions. The DNA/PMET-AuNPs/PGE demonstrated good selectivity toward Hg2+ against other metal ions such as V4+, Pb2+, Cr3+, Cd2+, Cu2+, Zn2+, Sn2+, In3+, Ge4+, and Fe3+. Real samples studies were carried out in sea water and fish samples.

AB Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) is a metalloprotein found naturally in raw milk samples and is considered as an important biomarker in quality control of milk. Its easy, personalized, as well as instrument-less detection is important to ensure the pasteurization and its differentiation form raw milk. In view of such importance of APL, we have developed an office punching machine crafted paper biosensor for naked eye detection of ALP in milk samples. The quantitative estimation is done by digital image colorimetry (DIC) based technique integrated with smartphone. The sensor-probe was developed by the covalent immobilization of ALP antibody (anti-ALP) onto the functionalized paper surface. The fabrication of the biosensing probe was characterized using DIC, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and atomic force microscopy (AFM). The detection was based on immunocomplexation between the sensor-probe and ALP, which generates blue-green precipitate as an analytical signal by exploiting the catalytic activity of ALP towards 5-bromo-4-chloro 3-indolyl phosphate (BCIP). The dose dependent appearance of the blue-green complex was captured using smartphone camera and DIC was employed using Red, Green, and Blue (RGB) profiling system, where the maximum sensitivity was obtained for the red color channel. Based on the DIC analysis, a wide dynamic range for the ALP detection is obtained from 10 to 1000 U/mL with the detection limit of 0.87 (+/- 0.07) U/mL. The designed paper-based biosensor is successfully applied to detect ALP in commercial and raw milk samples. Interferences due to components present in the milk samples was evaluated and the long-term stability of the designed biosensor was examined. Based on the detection principle, a miniaturized kit [20.0 mm (L) x 20.0 mm (W) x 2.15 mm (H)] was developed and applied for the ALP detection to demonstrate the instrument-free direct in-kitchen applicability.

AB Rolling circle amplification (RCA) is an elegant and well-recognized isothermal nucleic acid amplification mechanism that has been widely used for the detection of various kinds of genetic biomarkers. However, traditional RCA is a linear signal amplifying mechanism so that the amplification efficiency is generally not satisfactory. Herein, we rationally combine RCA with efficient loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) to establish a rapid and ultrasensitive RCA-LAMP method for the detection of microRNAs (miRNAs). In the RCA-LAMP, the target let-7a miRNA can directly template the ligation of a padlock probe to trigger RCA reaction, producing long and tandem amplification products. Only such RCA-produced long DNA repeats can act as the template to generate a lot of double stem-loop DNAs with functional sequences, which are the essential starting materials to initiate subsequent LAMP. Finally, the products of LAMP reaction, the amount of which is dependent on the initial miRNA dosage, can be fluorescently monitored in a real-time manner. Through the combination of ligation-mediated RCA with LAMP, the amplification efficiency and the detection sensitivity has been significantly improved. As a result, even 10 aM miRNA target can be clearly and accurately detectable. Despite the excellent analytical performance for miRNA analysis, compared with conventional RCA-based miRNA assays, the combination of RCA with LAMP does not introduce any additional reaction steps or sample transfer operations. Both the RCA and LAMP are fulfilled in a single step. Therefore, this facile and ultrasensitive RCA-LAMP assay provides a new promising tool for miRNA analysis and can be extended to the detection of various kinds of genetic biomarkers.

AB Herein, we present that the reduced graphene oxide (rGO) doped with nanometer-sized ferrocene moieties is a new, excellent active material for redox sensors. Two distinct approaches were utilized for the modification of rGO. The first method was based on the covalent decoration of rGO via the addition of azomethine ylide generated from the ferrocenecarboxaldehyde oxime. The second approach utilized the adsorption of 1,1'-ferrocenedicarboxylic acid on the graphene sheet via the pi-pi stacking. The morphology of the synthesized graphene materials was studied by application of microscopic techniques, whereas the Raman data allowed the characteristics of the tested materials in terms of their structural properties. The tested graphene materials doped with ferrocene moieties were used as a bioactive platform for glucose oxidase (GOx) immobilization. The enzyme was immobilized onto the rGO materials in two ways: (i) using a crosslinking agent - glutaraldehyde (GA) and (ii) by formation of the amide bonds between carboxylic groups of rGO-Fc(COOH)(2) and amine groups from enzyme. Ferrocene moieties present at the graphene surface play the role of mediator in the electron transfer between the redox center of GOx and the electrode surface. The functionality of the constructed biosensors has been tested on real samples. The results of the recovery rates showed a satisfying degree of accuracy toward determination of glucose concentration. Examination of the potential interfering species has demonstrated favorable sensitivity and selectivity of the designed biosensor for the detection of glucose.

AB Catechol, one of the major effluents released by various chemical and metal processing industries, causes severe pollution of groundwater. Monitoring of catechol in water using cost-effective, handheld sensor is demanding for the safety of the environment. In this work, non-enzymatic zinc oxide thin film based electrochemical strip sensor is developed on conducting glass substrate for detection of catechol. The preparation of strip without employing standard Pt or Ag/AgCl electrodes and simply depositing ZnO through wet chemical process represents a cost-effective innovative technique. The ZnO thin film is characterized using field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), atomic force microscopy (AFM) and grazing incidence X-ray diffractometer (GIXRD). Catechol is electrochemically detected by means of cyclic voltammetry and amperometry. A prominent redox peak of the developed strip attributed to the detection of catechol is observed at -0.26 V in cyclic voltammetry. The strip is integrated with readout meter and an algorithm is built based on the experimentally observed linear variation of amperometric current with catechol concentration. The quantitative detection performance is demonstrated by testing 0.1-12 ppm catechol solutions.

AB Electrical impedance-based sensing of cell activity has become a powerful analytical tool that allows the monitoring of several relevant biological processes associated with cell evolution and morphology. In these types of biosensors, the electrode design has a direct impact on the sensitivity because it defines the capability of the biosensor to measure small changes in the impedance resulting from cell activities. Herein, impedance-based biosensors arrays with several configurations were successfully developed and used to study the impact of the electrode layout on the dynamics of cultured pre-osteoblast cells. The biosensor design was initially validated by measuring the effect of electrode design on the capacitance of a dielectric polymer (parylene) that mimics the dielectric characteristics of cell populations, results are shown in the Supplementary information section. Results from in vitro cell growth indicate that the optimized design of single electrodes with a diameter of 50 pm, are the most sensitive to cell motion whereas increasing the number of electrodes allows clear differentiation between living and dead cells after 3 h of inducing apoptosis. Apoptosis death was induced with Staurosporine, a chemical mediator of apoptosis in osteoblasts. These impedance results have been validated with optical imaging and flow cytometry analysis that were performed on parallel cultures. Frequency and electrolyte concentration effects are also discussed.

AB Saxitoxin (STX) has high toxicity, and is water soluble, acid stable and thermostable. Therefore, STX in seawater can be accumulated by marine organism to form bioaccumulation. To ensure the safety of seafood for consumption, it is crucial to accurately determine trace STX in seawater and seafood. We herein developed a novel magnetic electrochemical immunosensor for ultra-sensitive detection of STX in seawater and seafood by using non-competitive strategy. The immunosensor employs STX-specific antibody-functionalized magnetic beads (MBs) for STX recognition, palladium-doped graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4-PdNPs) peroxidase mimetic for catalyzing H2O2-mediated oxidation of 3,3',5,5'-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) to generate signal. The immunosensor combines the merits of g-C3N4-PdNPs peroxidase mimetic, non-competitive strategy, MBs-based antibody recognition and magnetic gold electrode, and thus has excellent stability, lower cost, no risk of false positive result, high sensitivity and strong ability resist to matrix interference. The proposed immunosensor has been successfully used to detect trace STX in seawater and shellfish samples with a detection limit of 1.2 pg/mL (4.0 x 10(-12) M), a recovery of 93-107% and a relative standard deviation (RSD, n = 5) < 5%. The success of this study provided a promising approach for the rapid and on-site detection of trace STX in seawater and seafood.

AB With the tangible threat posed by the release of chemical and biological warfare (CBW) agents, detection of airborne pathogens is a critical military and security concern. Recent air sampling techniques developed for biocollection take advantage of Electrowetting on Dielectric (EWOD) to recover material, producing highly concentrated droplet samples. Bespoke EWOD-based digital microfluidics platforms are very well suited to take full advantage of the microlitre concentrated droplet resulting from this recovery process. In this paper we present a free-standing, fully automated DMF platform for immunoassay. Using this system, we demonstrate the automated detection of four classes of CBW agent simulant biomolecules and organisms each representing credible threat agents. Taking advantage of the full magnetic separation process with antibody-bound microbeads, rapid and complete separation of specific target antigen can be achieved with minimal washing steps allowing for very rapid detection. Here, we report clear detection of four categories of antigens achieved with assay completion times of between six and ten minutes. Detection of HSA, Bacillus atrophaeus (BG spores), MS2 bacteriophage and Escherichia coli are demonstrated with estimated limit of detection of respectively 30 ng ml(-1), 4 x 10(4) cfu ml(-1), 106 pfu ml(-1) and 2 x 10(7) cfu ml(-1). The fully-integrated portable platform described in this paper is highly compatible with the next generation of electrowetting-coupled air samplers and thus shows strong potential toward future in-field deployable biodetection systems and could have key implication in life changing sectors such as healthcare, environment or food security.

AB Herein, a ratiometric fluorescence sensing strategy coupled with smartphone imaging-based sensing platform was proposed for the on-site determination of fluoride ion (F-) with high sensitivity and accuracy. The principle of sensing strategy is based on the fluoride-promoted Si-O bond cleavage of 2-(tert-butyldiphenylsilyloxy)phenol (2-TBDPSP) to release 2-hydroxyphenolate, which rapidly auto-oxidized to ortho-quinone. As excellent electron acceptor, these quinone species covalently bonded on the surface of dual-emission amino-modified quantum dots (QDs) nanohybrid via a Michael's type adduction, quenching the fluorescence of green-emitting QDs on the surface of the nanohybrid, while not affecting the fluorescence of red-emitting QDs embedding silica nano spheres. Upon exposure to different amounts of F-, the variations of dual emission intensity ratios display continuous color changes from green to red, which could be directly observed by naked eyes. Then a smartphone imaging-based sensing platform was constructed by 3D-printing technology. The smartphone camera acquired the images of fluorescence derived from samples, and the Color Picker APP installed in smartphone continued to read out the Red, Green and Blue (RGB) channel values of these images. There was a linear relationship between the ratio of Red and Green (R/G) and F- concentration in the range of 0-70.0 mu M. The limit of detection (LOD) was estimated to be 2.0 mu M, much lower than the allowable level of F- (similar to 63.16 mu M) in drinking water set by World Health Organization. This methodology reported here is low-cost, portable, easy-operation, and thus potentially attractive for F- determination without the need of elaborate equipment.

AB The rapid and sensitive detection of specific nucleic acid sequences at the point-of-care (PoC) is becoming increasingly in demand for a variety of emergent biomedical applications ranging from infectious disease diagnostics to the screening of antimicrobial resistance. To meet such demand, considerable efforts have been invested towards the development of portable and integrated analytical devices combining microfluidics with miniaturized signal transducers.
   Here, we demonstrate the combination of rolling circle amplification (RCA)-based nucleic acid amplification with an on-chip size-selective trapping of amplicons on silica beads (similar to 8 nL capture chamber) coupled with a thin-film photodiode (200 x 200 mu m area) fluorescence readout. Parameters such as the flow rate of the amplicon solution and trapping time were optimized as well as the photodiode measurement settings, providing minimum detection limits below 0.5 fM of targeted nucleic acids and requiring only 5 mu L of pre-amplified sample. Finally, we evaluated the analytical performance of our approach by benchmarking it against a commercial instrument for RCA product (RCP) quantification and further investigated the effect of the number of RCA cycles and elongation times (ranging from 10 to 120 min). Moreover, we provide a demonstration of the application for diagnostic purposes by detecting RNA from influenza and Ebola viruses, thus highlighting its suitability for integrated PoC systems.

AB In this work, we achieved the selective detection of wild and mutated rpoB gene in M. tuberculosis using an electrochemical DNA (E-DNA) sensor based on polypyrrole/Fe3O4 nanocomposite bearing redox naphthoquinone tag on PAMAM (spaNQ/PAMAM/PPy/Fe3O4). The hybridization between a given probe and the complementary DNA target induced a large decrease in the naphthoquinone redox signal as measured by SWV and no cross-hybridization with single nucleotide mismatch DNA target occurred. Thanks to the catalytic properties of iron oxide nanoparticles combined with conducting properties of polypyrrole platform, we demonstrated that the transducing system allowed the detection of 1 fM of DNA target in a 50-mu L drop corresponding to 3 x 10(4) copies of DNA. The sensor was able to detect the rpoB gene in PCR-amplified samples of genomic DNA and could also discriminate between the wild type rpoB gene and a single nucleotide mutated rpoB gene that provides resistance to rifampicin. Furthermore, the sensor could selectively detect the wild and mutant DNA in genomic samples without PCR amplification.

AB The development of chemical sensors capable of detecting the specific glycosylation patterns of proteins offers a powerful mean for the early detection of cancer. Unfortunately, this strategy is scarcely explored because receptors recognizing the glycans linked to proteins are challenging to discover. In this work, we describe a simple method for directing the selection of aptamers toward the glycan structure of the glycoproteins, with prostate-specific antigen (PSA) as a model target. Using this strategy, we identified one aptamer (PSA-1) that binds the glycan moiety of PSA with reasonable affinity (a dissociation constant of 177 +/- 65 nM). Interestingly, an electrochemical sensor with a sandwich format employing the identified aptamer as a signaling receptor, provides a tool of discriminating human PSA from the unglycosylated protein, with a limit of detection of 0.66 ng/mL. The sensor responds to different levels of PSA in serum, correlating well with chemiluminescence ELISA used in hospitals even with higher potential to discriminate clinically meaningful prostate cancer. Although validation on a larger cohort is needed, this is the first demonstration of an aptamer-based sensor to detect PSA by focusing in its glycan moiety

AB This paper demonstrates the use of a smartphone-based sensor for fluorescence polarization (FP) analysis of biomolecules. The FP detection can rapidly sense ligand-analyte bindings by measuring molecule mobility, and thus, FP-based assays have been widely used for rapid diagnostics in clinics. Here, we implemented the FP detection apparatus using a 3D-printed compact holder and the built-in camera of a smartphone. The system offers accurate measurements of the degree of polarization by simultaneously detecting the fluorescence intensities parallel and perpendicular to the polarization of the excitation. The fluorescence signal of the sample is excited by a laser or light-emitting diode and separated by a polarization beam cube depending on the polarization. Parallel and perpendicular polarized emissions are projected onto two different regions of the sensor chip in the smartphone camera. A custom software app was developed to count the average intensity in the areas of interest and compute the degree of polarization. We validated the system by measuring the polarization of dye molecules dissolved in solutions with different viscosities. As an example of biomolecule sensing, a competitive FP immunoassay of Prostaglandin E-2 was demonstrated using the developed system and exhibited the limit of detection of 1.57 ng/mL. The smartphone-based FP assay platform can also be implemented for the detection of toxins, disease biomarkers, and pathogens in resource-limited settings.

AB We present a QR code paper microfluidic colorimetric assay that can exploit the hardware and software on mobile devices, and circumvent sample preparation by directly targeting volatile biomarkers. Our platform is a printable microarray of well-defined reaction regions, which outputs an instant diagnosis by directing the user to a URL containing their test result, while simultaneously storing epidemiological data for remote access and bioinformatics. To assist in the rapid identification of Escherichia coli in bloodstream infections, we employed an existing colorimetric reagent (p-dimethylaminocinnamaldehyde) and adapted its use to detect volatile indole, a biomarker produced by E. coli. Our assay was able to quantitatively detect indole in the headspace of E. coli culture after 12 h of growth (27.0 +/- 3.1 ppm), assisting in species-level identification hours earlier than existing methods. Results were confirmed with headspace solid-phase microextraction (HS-SPME) two-dimensional gas chromatography time-of-flight mass spectrometry (GC x GC-ToFMS), which estimated indole concentration in E. con culture to average 32.3 5.2 ppm after 12 h of growth. This QR paper microfluidic platform represents a novel development in both telemedicine and diagnostics using volatile biomarkers. We envision that our QR code platform can be extended to other colorimetric assays for real-time diagnostics in low-resource environments.

AB The development of simple, flexible, cost-effective and sensitive electrochemical methods for protein analysis is of very importance for its potential application in disease diagnosis and biomedicine research. Herein, a new protein binding-induced proximity recognition and polymerase-powered DNA walker strategy was proposed for one-step and sensitive electrochemical quantification of proteins. Two DNA probes were designed with a hairpin-like one immobilized on the electrode and another one used as a DNA walker strand. The protein binding with the recognition elements labeled on these two probes brought their proximity hybridization, accompanied with the annealing of a redox probe-labeled primer strand on the opened immobilization probe. The DNA polymerization of primer strand in the presence of DNA polymerase induced the release of the DNA walker strand, which then walked to the adjacent immobilization probe for the proximity hybridization and progressive polymerase-powered DNA walker operation again. This induced the electrochemical signal reporting and amplifying toward protein quantification. The sensitive and selective detection toward proteins was achieved with the detection limits toward anti-dig antibody and streptavidin as 80 and 16 pM, respectively. Thus, the current study offers a simple, generic, one-step and amplified detection strategy for electrochemical protein quantification.

AB Ion-selective electrodes (ISE) can rapidly, sensitively detect their corresponding ions and are suitable for field testing. However, most ISE methods cannot detect other targets directly which limits their practice application. Herein, we established an aptamer-sensing platform to detect organic small molecule using a portable fluoride-selective electrode (FSE). To achieve the purpose, novel signal tags were fabricated based on nano metal-organic frameworks (NMOF) encapsulating F and labeling aptamers. They were then immobilized on one stir-bar. Subsequently, a double stir-bars (bar-a and b) assisted target recycling strategy was designed to convert organic small molecular target to F for signal development and amplification. The movement of tags from bar-a to b can be triggered by the analytes. After reaction, the transferred signal tags in bar-b were washed and released F which can be measured by FSE for qualification of the target. The assay was evaluated to detect kanamycin or chloramphenicol which was employed as the representatives of organic small molecular with a low detection limit of 0.35 nmol L-1 or 0.46 nmol L-1, respectively. Satisfactory performance was observed in complex sample analysis of kanamycin (milk, fish, urine and serum) with a recovery of 91-108% and an RSD (n = 6) < 5%. The proposed method broadens the application of traditional FSE to the detection of organic small molecule. And the employment of NMOF which has higher encapsulating capacity of F for preparing signal tags can be extended to FSE based aptasensors.

AB Type (II) diabetes is one of the major threats to mankind as it causes insulin resistance in human body and Retinol Binding Protein 4 (RBP4) is currently considered as a potential biomarker for early management of this disease. Hence a low-level detection of RBP4 is a very important task and for this purpose, a novel RBP4 biosensor has been developed using homemade plastic chip electrodes (PCEs) as a platform for self-assembled monolayer (SAM) of 4-ATP and further functionalization with glutaraldehyde. Anti RBP4 is used as biorecognition species and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy has been performed to detect different RBP4 concentrations plotted against charge transfer resistance. A wide concentration range from 100 fg/mL to 1 ng/mL has been tested and a low limit of detection (LOD) of 100 fg/mL has been achieved. This is the first report for fabrication of electrochemical biosensor of RBP4 using Ag-Ab interaction having such low LOD. The sensor is characterized by various physico-chemical techniques. Excellent reproducibility and quick measurement make this biosensor extremely useful for the biomedical industry.

AB For the determination of dopamine (DA) in serum samples, a quenching-type electrochemiluminescence sensor (MIECLS) was constructed in this study. Upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) enhanced by covalent organic frameworks (COFs)-based hybrid and oligoaniline-crosslinked gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) imprinting recognition sites were introduced in electrochemiluminescence (ECL) system at the first time. The porous COFs-based hybrid with large specific surface area was modified on the electrode firstly to hold more UCNPs and imprinting recognition sites. AuNPs was employed in the developed sensor for two objectives: 1) AuNPs on the COFs-based hybrid enabled the hybrid to tunnel the electrons, which helped to improve the ECL intensity; 2) AuNPs-based thioaniline units (PATP@AuNPs) electropolymerized on the electrode in the presence of template to form oli-goaniline-cross-linked AuNPs matrix. Then the exclusion of template from matrix yielded the molecularly three-dimensional imprinted contours with conductivity, which facilitated specific recognition and further amplified the ECL. The double recognition mode in this work involves the recognition effect of imprinted contours and quenching effect of o-benzoquinone species. The quantum chemical calculation was performed to analyze the possible recognition and the binding mechanisms of molecularly three-dimensional imprinted contours. The results showed imprinted contours could bind the targets by complementary spatial cavities and weak interactions. The proposed approach yielded a wide detection range (10(-14)-10(-6) M), low limit of detection (LOD = 2 x 10(-15) M) and acceptable recoveries (93.25-112.97%) in rat serum sample, demonstrating that the developed method holds great promise to be applied to DA detection in practical samples.

Briefly, MoS2/g-C3N4/black TiO2 was deposited on an indium tin oxide (ITO) electrode surface, after which gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) and probe DNA were assembled on the modified electrode. Hybridization with miRNA-396a resulted in a rigid DNA: RNA hybrid being formed, which was recognized by the S9.6 antibody. The captured antibody can further conjugate with the secondary IgG antibodies of Histostar@AuNPs, thereby leading to the immobilization of horse radish peroxidase (HRP). In the presence of HRP, the oxidation of 4-chloro-1-naphthol (4-CN) by H2O2 was accelerated, producing the insoluble product benzo-4-chlorohexadienone on the electrode surface and causing a significant decrease in the photocurrent. The developed biosensor could detect miRNA-396a at concentrations from 0.5 fM to 5000 fM, with a detection limit of 0.13 fM. Further, the proposed method can also be used to investigate the effect of heavy metal ions on the expression level of miRNAs. Results suggest that the biosensor developed herein offers a promising platform for the ultrasensitive detection of miRNA.

AB In this work, 4,4-difluoro-8-(4-hydroxyphenyl) - 2,6-diethynly-1,3,5,7-tetramethyl-4-bora-3a,4a-diaza-s-indacene (BODIPY) having double terminal ethynyl groups was synthesized. Three dimensional single walled carbon nanotube (SWCNT)-BODIPY hybrid material (3D SWCNT-BODIPY) was synthesized by the reaction of BODIPY bearing double terminal ethynyl groups with azido containing SWCNTs via "Click" reaction. The structural properties and electrochemical detection of eserine (a pesticide) on BODIPY functionalized SWCNTs as a three dimensional (3D) material were investigated. A glassy carbon electrode (GCE) was modified by 3D SWCNT-BODIPY hybrid material for the determination of eserine in the range of 0.25-2.25 M. In the study by the square wave voltammetry (SWV), the bare GCE showed no response, while the new peak at - 0.6 V appeared in the case of the modified electrode. The detection limit and quantification were determined as 160 nM and 528 nM for eserine on the 3D SWCNT-BODIPY modified electrode, respectively. Eserine was also determined with a standard addition method in different brands of orange juices, and the recovery of eserine was obtained to be in the range of 102.09% and 103.22%. This study clearly indicates that the 3D SWCNT-BODIPY modified electrode tested as an electrochemical sensor was found to be highly selective and sensitive to eserine.

AB Misclassification of positive partitions in microfluidic digital polymerase chain reaction (dPCR) can cause the false positives and false negatives, which significantly alter the resulting estimate of target DNA molecules. To address this issue, establishing real-time fluorescence interrogation of each partition in microfluidic arrays is an effective way in which false positive and false negative partitions can be eliminated. However, currently available devices for real-time fluorescence interrogation are either not competent for microfluidic digital array, or they are bulky, expensive and entail peripheral equipment due to low integration. Therefore, in this study, a Raspberry Pi based, low-cost and highly integrated device is presented to achieve real-time fluorescence detection for microfluidic digital array, termed real-time dPCR device. In the device, uniform thermocycler, streamlined real-time fluorescence imaging setup, and compact data processing system are all integrated to undergo on-chip dPCR amplification, real-time fluorescence detection, and data analysis. Using this real-time dPCR device, the accuracy of DNA absolute quantification by dPCR is improved, since the misclassification of positive partitions is efficiently reduced based on the characteristic real-time fluorescence curves of positive partitions in a self-priming microfluidic chip. Compared with end-point dPCR on our device and commercialized QuantStudie (TM) 3D dPCR system, the real-time dPCR on our device exhibits a higher accuracy for DNA quantification. In addition, this real-time dPCR device is much smaller and cheaper than the commercialized Digital PCR system, but not sacrificing the capability of error correction for absolute quantitation analysis. Conclusively, this highly integrated real-time dPCR device is very beneficial for DNA quantitative analysis where the determination accuracy is pivotal.

AB Skin cancer is the most frequent kind of cancer in white people in many parts of the world. UV-induced DNA damage and genetic mutation can subsequently lead to skin cancer. Therefore development of new biosensing strategies for detection of UV-induced DNA damage is of great importance. Here we demonstrate a novel combination of an ex-vivo skin biointerface and an electrochemical DNA sensor for the direct detection of UV-induced DNA damage and investigation the protective effect of various UV blockers (Zinc-oxide (ZnO), titanium dioxide (TiO2) nanoparticles (NPs) and sunscreens) against DNA damage. A diazonium modified screen-printed carbon electrode immobilized with a DNA sequence related to the p53 tumour suppressor gene, the most commonly affected gene in human UV-induced skin cancer, was applied as an electrochemical DNA sensor. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was employed for the detection of DNA damage induced by UV-A radiation by following the changes in charge transfer resistance (R-ct). The protective effects of UV blockers applied onto a pig skin surface (a suitable model representing human skin) were successfully detected by the DNA sensor. We observed that the naked skin has little UV protection showing an 18.2% decreases in Delta R/R values compared to the control, while applying both NPs and NP-formulated sunscreens could significantly reduce DNA damage, resulting in a decrease in Delta R/R values of 67.1% (ZnO NPs), 77.2% (TiO2 NPs), 77.1% (sunscreen 1) and 92.4% (sunscreen 2), respectively. Moreover, doping moisturising cream with NPs could provide a similar DNA protective effect. This new method is a biologically relevant alternative to animal testing and offers advantages such as fast, easy and inexpensive processing, in addition to its miniaturised dimension, and could be used for a range of applications in other sources of DNA damage and the protective effect of different UV blocking agents and other topical formulations.

AB The filtration effect improves the impedance change through specific binding of target molecules in plasma, and decreases this change by nonspecific binding of matrix factors in plasma (i.e., matrix effect). A difference in dielectrophoresis (DEP) forces applied to target molecules and matrix factors causes the filtration effect. An optimized DEP force affects target molecules, which remain in the reaction region of an interdigitated micro electrode (IME) sensor. Various matrix factors, which are larger than the target molecules, are influenced by a strong DEP force and are filtered out of the reaction region. To demonstrate the filtration effect, the matrix effect was confirmed in standard plasma and in phosphate-buffered saline, based on the detection of amyloid beta (A beta), an Alzheimer's disease (AD)-associated peptide. The filtration effect was verified using the matrix effect factor (MEF), which was calculated from the impedance change values in different detection environments. In standard plasma, the MEF value decreased by approximately 78.12%, and in buffer with heterogeneous A beta, by approximately 75.43%. Plasma from patients with AD and normal controls (NCs) was analyzed using the value of the impedance change by the filtration effect. The impedance change was enhanced approximately 1.52 +/- 0.03-fold in AD plasma, but declined approximately 0.90 +/- 0.03-fold in NC plasma. This difference tendency by the filtration effect was the disease evaluation index and used as an important criterion that distinguished between the AD and NC plasma. Plasma-based AD diagnosis may be possible, based on the filtration effect.

AB The early detection of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) upon the onset of chest pain symptoms is crucial for patient survival. However, this detection is challenging, particularly without a persistent elevation of ST-segment reflected in an electrocardiogram or in blood tests. A majority of the available point-of-care testing devices allow accurate and rapid diagnosis of AMI. However, AMI diagnosis is reliable only at intermediate and later stages, with myocardial injury (> 6 h) and MI, based on the expression of specific cardiac biomarkers including troponin I or T (cTnI or cTnT), creatine kinase-MB (CK - MB), and myoglobin. Diagnosis at the early myocardial ischemia stage is not possible. To overcome this limitation, a sensitive and rapid microfluidic paper-based device ( PAD) was developed for the simultaneous detection of multiple cardiac biomarkers for the early and late diagnosis of AMI. The glycogen phosphorylase isoenzyme BB (GPBB) was detected during early (within first 4 h) ischemic myocardial injury. On the same PAD platform, detection of prolonged elevation of levels of cTnT and CK-MB, which are only produced 6 h after the onset of chest pain in human serum, was possible. Sandwich immunoassay performed on the PAD achieved reproducibility (RSD approximately 10% and intra-and inter-day precision (CV 10-20%, 99th percentile), as well as consistently stable test results for 28 days, with strong correlation (r(2) = 0.962), using the standard Siemens Centaur XPT Immunoassay system. The present findings indicate the potential of the PAD platform as a point-of-care device for the early diagnosis and prognosis of AMI.

This research investigated the effects and corresponding mechanisms of endogenous and exogenous chemical signals (i.e., Nacylhamoserine lactones, AHLs) on the Geobacter soli biofilm. The results showed that Geobacter soli GSS01 secreted detectable endogenous AHLs to facilitate the formation and electrochemical activity of the biofilm, and that exogenous AHLs could further promoted these activities. Analyses of surface proteins revealed that the mechanisms promoted by endogenous and exogenous AHLs were somewhat different. Endogenous AHLs improved the relative abundance of external membrane proteins, while exogenous AHLs further facilitated the formation of amide II and a stronger H-bond between the carbonyl group and the amide. Furthermore, the proteomics analysis indicated that endogenous AHLs enhanced extracellular polymeric substance production by up-regulating the expression of key enzymes participating in EPS production, and simultaneously affected the physiological performance of individual cells. These results demonstrate, for the first time, the importance of chemical signals in Geobacter sp. and provide a comprehensive understanding of the chemical signals involved in biofilm formation and electrochemical activity of Geobacter sp..

AB A novel molecularly imprinted polymer-capped acrylated nitrogen doped graphene quantum dots and bimetallic Au/Ag core-shell was synthesized to serve as a sensing nano-hybrid film for the detection of an anticancerous drug, hydroxyurea. This exploited the use of a functionalized nitrogen doped graphene quantum dots iniferter. This initiated the polymerization, following "surface grafting-from" approach, over the surface of a screen-printed carbon electrode to obtain requisite stability and selectivity of the measurement. Herein, nitrogen doped graphene quantum dots were prepared utilizing the degree of dehydration/carbonization of citric acid (carbon skeleton) and urea (nitrogen dopant) as source materials. This provided an efficient sensor platform anchoring bimetallic Au/Ag core-shell on its surface. The nano-assembly of acrylated nitrogen doped graphene quantum dots and bimetallic Au/Ag core-shell@imprinted polymer actually amplified the electrode kinetics by improving the diffusion coefficient (similar to 20-fold) and electron-transfer kinetics (similar to 5-fold), in comparison to the simple bimetallic Au/Ag core-shell decorated imprinted sensor. Under optimized conditions of differential pulse anodic stripping voltammetric transduction, a linear relationship between the current and the concentration was obtained in the range of 0.62-102.33 ng mL(-1) for hydroxyurea. The detection limit was observed to be 0.07 ng mL(-1) in blood plasma, without having any matrix effect, cross-reactivity, and false-positives. The proposed sensor assures its clinical applicability for the treatment of cancer.

AB Single-layered gold nano-hole arrays lead to extraordinary optical transmission (EOT)-modulated surface plasmonic resonance (SPR) and have seen much progress in biochemical sensing. To further improve the sensing performance, the single-layered structure need to be changed. In this paper, a micromachined Fabry-Perot interferometer (mu FPI), featuring two parallel and flat gold-coated mirrors, one of which has sub-wavelength nanohole arrays, was designed, fabricated, and tested experimentally. Its transmission spectrum was confirmed to have EOT-modulated SPR patterns, and its characteristic peak wavelength was found to have a refractive index sensitivity of 593 nm / RIU and a Q factor up to 128.4, which is 10.2 times its EOT counterparts. By applying AC electric signals across the two gold layers, dielectrophoresis (DEP) induced near the nano-holes was proven to enrich particles significantly. To remove the thermal effects on the transmission spectrum, heat was dissipated by flowing sample during measurement. Biochemical sensing experiments were conducted using BSA protein medium of different low concentrations, demonstrating the detection sensitivity enhancement of similar to 6-fold for 1 pM compared to 100 pM. This novel mu FPI presents a new paradigm in EOT-based SPR sensing technology by combining the benefits of mu FPI interference, EOT near-field measurement and DEP enrichment of molecules.

AB Gold electrodes have been used in a wide range of electrochemical biosensors because their functionalization process with thiols has been well described and, in general, they offer good chemical stability. However, one of the most commonly used redox-pairs in electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, Hexacyanoferrate (II)/(III), causes corrosion of the gold electrodes and consequently damages the surface modification. This leads to alterations of the sensing signals, and thus, renders the quantitative and sensitive detection of target molecules virtually impossible. To overcome this problem we introduced the in-situ generation of Hexaammineruthenium (II)/(III) as redox-pair during the impedimetric measurement by applying a DC-bias. This DC-bias was chosen in such a way that it supplied Hexaammineruthenium (II) in a suitable concentration at the electrode surface by reducing Hexaammineruthenium (III). We compared the stability of photolithographically fabricated thin-film and screen-printed gold electrodes in Hexacyanoferrate and Hexaammineruthenium solutions. Further, long-time characterization of the electrochemical properties with cyclic voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy revealed that Hexaammineruthenium (II)/(III) was an excellent redox-pair for stable impedimetric measurements with gold electrodes. To demonstrate the suitability of Hexaammineruthenium for biosensing we applied it for the impedimetric detection of human-IgG. This biosensor exhibited a linear range from 11.3 ng/mL to 113 mu g/mL, which is a suitable range for diagnostic applications.

AB The fully-mechanized Multicommutated Flow Analysis (MCFA) system for determination of transferrin in human serum has been developed. The analytical methodology concerns immunoprecipitation measurements with the use of LED-based nephelometric flow-through detectors with polymeric light guides, To improve the mechanization degree of the MCFA system, the Do-It-Yourself electronic module for mobile phone control has been developed. The design and structure of an Android software (build using open source application) controlling the operation of presented flow system has been presented. To bypass the problem of nonlinearity of calibration curve caused by the nature of antigen antibody interactions, the on-line dilution module has been integrated into the presented manifold. Under optimized conditions, the developed flow analysis system is characterized by relatively low limit of detection and quantitation (2.0 and 4.9 mg L-1, respectively), good precision (RSD < 4%), low reagent and sample consumption per one measurement (16 mu L of undiluted reagent and 20 mu L of undiluted sample without further on-line dilution, respectively) and relatively high throughput (approximately 35 signal recordings per hour). The developed MCFA system enabled to analyze 16 serum samples with the transferrin concentration from 90 to almost 350 mg dL(-1) with statistical agreement to the reference method.

AB 5-Hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) plays an important role in switching genes on and off in mammals, and it is implicated in both embryonic development and cancer progression. Herein, a novel photoelectrochemical (PEC) biosensor was developed for 5hmC detection based on WS2 nanosheets as the photoactive material and boronic acid functionalized carbon dots (B-CDs) for signal amplification unit. This biosensor can also be used for T4-beta-glucosyltransferase (beta-GT) activity assessment. Firstly, WS2 nanosheets and gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) were immobilized on an ITO electrode surface. Then probe DNA was immobilized on this electrode surface via Au-S bond. Afterwards, the complementary DNA containing 5hmC was then captured on the modified electrode surface by hybridization. Subsequently, beta-GT transferred glucose from uridine diphosphoglucose to the hydroxyl groups of the 5hmC residues. After glycosylation, B-CDs could further be immobilized on the modified electrode surface resulting in a strong photocurrent. The PEC biosensor afforded high selectivity, excellent sensitivity and good reproducibility, with detection limits of 0.0034 nM and 0.028 unit/mL for 5hmC and beta-GT, respectively. Results demonstrate that the photoelectrochemical strategy introduced here based on WS2 nanosheets and B-CDs offers a versatile platform for hydroxymethylated DNA detection, beta-GT activity assessment and beta-GT inhibitor screening.

AB We here report a novel method for antibiotic detection by making use of DNA/metal ion interaction coupled with Ag-DNAzyme cleavage-mediated signal amplification. Taking the analysis of chloramphenicol (CAP) as an example, upon the specific recognition between the antibiotic CAP and its aptamer, the secondary structure of the DNA aptamer shaped by C-Ag+-C base mismatches will be altered, liberating the pre-captured Ag+. Subsequently, the free Ag+ provided as a cofactor can activate the Ag-DNAzyme, which behaves recycled cleavage of substrate DNA on the electrode surface for signal amplification. The more CAP is present, the more Ag+ is released, thus more Ag-DNAzyme can be activated to achieve a higher electrochemical signal, Therefore, the target-responsive variation of electrochemical signal enables the sensitive detection of CAP. The proposed method is cost-effective only with plain metal ion as modulator. It has also been challenged with real food samples, indicating the potential to be a promising tool for food safety detection.

We also used this method for capturing cancer cells through a linker molecule, folic acid (FA). Furthermore, we have demonstrated that enhanced electrocatalytic activity of the p(TA)-modified surface could be used for simultaneous electrochemical determination of biologically important electroactive molecules such as ascorbic acid (AA), dopamine (DA), and uric acid (UA). This HRP-catalyzed polymerization of TA and p(TA)-mediated surface modification method can provide a simple and new framework to construct multifunctional platforms for covalent attachment of biomolecules and development of sensitive electrochemical sensing devices

AB A rapid and ultrasensitive molecularly imprinted photoelectrochemical (MIP-PEC) sensing platform based on ITO electrode modified with GO-CdS heterojunction was prepared for ultrasensitive measure of fumonisin B-1 (FB1). CdS quantum dots (QDs) were combined with a suitable amount of graphene oxide (GO) to form a heterojunction to enhance signal response with accurately calculating energy levels (VB/CB or HOMO/LUMO). The MIP-PEC sensor was successful fabricated after MIP was immobilized on the electrode with the basis of these results. In the phosphate buffer solution (PBS), it was clearly observed that the non-elution MIP-PEC sensor had almost no photocurrent response, which was due to the slower electron transfer speed. When the MIP-PEC sensor is eluted in ethanol, its photocurrent response was significantly restored, that was because the fact that the template molecules were washed away, and electron donors entered the holes and accelerated the electron transfer. Its photocurrent response was reduced because of holes blocked when the MIP-PEC sensor was hatched in the template molecules culture fluid. This phenomenon fully showed that the MIP-PEC sensor can specifically detect the target. Thus, The work has a linear range from 0.01 to 1000 ng mL(-1) with a detection limit of 4.7 pg mL(-1) for FB1. Furthermore, the fabricated MIP-PEC sensor will confirm the actual application.

AB Sensitive but with simple, inexpensive detection of disease-related biomarkers in real biological samples is of quite necessity for early diagnosis and disease surveillance. We herein first introduced high-activity Fe3O4 nanozyme as signal amplifier to develop an ultrasensitive photoelectrochemical (PEC) immunoassay, which meanwhile has the distinct merits of both simplicity and low cost compared with previously reported enzyme-labeling PEC immunoassays. In the proposal, to illustrate and describe the PEC platform, prostate-specific antigen (PSA, Ag) was used as a target model. Specifically, ZnO nanorods (ZnO-NRs) grown vertically on a bare indium tin oxide (ITO) electrode was deposited with ZnIn2S4 nanocrystals, producing ZnIn2S4/ZnO-NRs/ITO photoelectrode as the PEC matrix to modify capture PSA antibody (Ab(1)) Histidine-modified Fe3O4 (his-Fe3O4) nanozyme as signal amplifier was linked with signal PSA antibody (Ab(2)) to form his-Fe3O4@Ab(2) conjugate, and was anchored through specific sandwich immunoreaction. The labeling his-Fe3O4 nanozyme acted as a peroxidase to induce the generation of the insoluble and insulating precipitation, resulting in an evident decrease in the photocurrent signal. On account of combined effects of high catalytic efficiency of the his-Fe3O4 nanozyme and excellent PEC properties of the ZnIn2S4/ZnO-NRs/ITO photoelectrode, ultralow detection limit of 18 fg/mL for target Ag detection was achieved. Besides, as high-activity his-Fe3O4 nanozyme has substituted natural enzyme as signal amplifier, simplicity and low cost of the PEC immunoassay was realized.

AB Due to the nearby relationship between human health, socioeconomic development and environmental pollution, the detection and identification of environmental pollutants need more attention. Therefore, the development of suitable analytical devices that are sensitive, specific, precise, quick, and easy-to-use are required to resolve the increased request for legislative action on environmental pollution control and early detection of rising pollutants. Currently, the development of biosensing instruments attracted important attention because of their high selectivity, sensitivity, simplicity, reliability, low-cost and real-time response. Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) sensor as an example of portable, rapid, and smart biosensing devices widely used for qualitative and quantitative detection of multiplexed pollutant in real-time. Thus, SPR principles, assay formats, surface modification methods and signal enhancement are summarized in this review. Moreover, applications of SPR in the detection of pesticide, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), heavy metals and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) over the past decade is discussed.

AB DNA-gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) conjugate is one of the most versatile bionanomaterials for biomedical and clinical diagnosis. However, to finely tune the hybridization ability and precisely control the orientation and conformation of surface-tethered oligonucleotides on AuNPs remains a hurdle. In this work, we developed a poly adenine-mediated spherical nucleic acid (polyA-mediated SNA) strategy by assembling di-block DNA probes on gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) to spatially control interdistance and hybridization ability of oligonucleotides on AuNPs. By modulating length of poly A bound on the SNA with different degrees of constructing, we presented significant improved biosensing performance including high hybridization efficiency, and expanded dynamic range of analytes with more sensitive detection limit. Furthermore, this polyA design could facilitate the programmable detection for DNA in serum environment and simultaneous multicolor detection of three different microRNAs associated with pancreatic carcinoma. The demonstration of the link between modulation of SNA assembly strategy and biodetection capability will increase the development of high performance diagnostic tools for translational biomedicine.

AB Porous organic framework (COP) nanomaterials have drawn increasing attention and showed promising potential in the applications of various fields. Nevertheless, its applications in biosensing or biomedical fields are still in the early stage. In this work, we designed and synthesized a series of nanohybrids of COF and Ce-based metal organic framework (Ce-MOF) for the first time as label-free bioplatforms for a sensitive electrochemical aptasensor to detect oxytetracycline (OTC). A novel kinds of Ce-MOF@COF hybrids were prepared by adding different dosages of COP, into the preparation system of Ce-MOF, for which COF was synthesized using melamine and cyanutic acidmonomers through polycondensation (represented by MCA), Basic characterizations revealed that Ce-MOF@MCA nanohybrids not only remained their orignal crystal and chemical structure and features, such as different Ce species containing in Ce-MOF (Ce3+ and Ce4+), various functional amino-groups of MCA, and individual frameworks, but also showed a large specific surface area and interpenetrated morphologies. As a result, the Ce-MOF@MCA hybrid with high content of MCA exhibited high bioaffmity toward the OTC-targeted aptamer, further leading to the incremental detection effect for OTC detection. Among different hybrid-based aptasensors, the Ce-MOF@MCA-based one with an MCA dosage of 500 mg exhibited the lowest limit of detection at 17.4 fg mL(-1) within a wider linearity of the OTC concentration within 0.1-0.5 ng mL(-1), Additionally, the fabricated aptasensor displayed excellent analytical performance with great reproducibility, high selectivity and stability, and acceptable applicability for detecting OTC in various aqueous solutions, including milk, wastewater, and urine samples. This new Ce-MOF@MCA hybrid will become an excellent aptasensors platform for detecting various analytes, such as antibiotics, heavy metal ions, or cancer markers, and it have shown the promissing application potentials in the fields of biomedicine, food safety and environmental monitoring.

AB Despite rapid progress in DNA biosensors by employing various materials as well as techniques, most of the reported sensors are based on specific recognition of a DNA fragment, however can not perform universal measurement of DNA molecules (i.e. genomic DNA). In this work, we proposed a novel DNA biosensing method based on instantaneously electrostatic attraction (IEA) between hexaammineruthenium (III) and DNA molecules. The current variation of freely diffused Ru(NH3)(6)(3+) caused by its quick and strong static interaction with phosphate backbones was employed as a universal probe to detect DNA molecules in solution, with no need for immobilization of capture probes on the electrode. After optimization, 30 mu L of 300 mu M Ru(NH3)(6)(3+) solution was added onto the gold electrode with a working electrode diameter of 2 mm, and a detection limit of 3.8 ng/mu L. was achieved, which is equivalent to NanoDror One spectrometer, the commonly used instrument for DNA quantification. Using reusable and inexpensive gold electrode, the approach provided an easy-operated sequence-independent DNA detection method, and was proved to be able to detect genomic and plasmid DNA directly.

AB Sensors that can rapidly and specifically detect nucleic acids and chemical molecules can revolutionize the diagnosis and treatment of diseases by allowing molecular-level informations to be used during the routine medicines. In this study, we demonstrated a novel dual-sensor that can be used to simultaneously detect any nucleic acids and chemical molecules whose binding aptamers can be found or synthesized. In the developed dual-sensor, the specifically designed PTG (a photosensitive azobenzene derivative carrying one photo" isomerizable azobenzene moiety, one threoninol terminal and one guanidinium terminal) molecules are introduced into the unwinding region of two 17 promoters, and two DNA bubbles are introduced upstream of the two T7 promoters. Without the target, the indicating gene in the dual-tensor would not be expressed since the binding with RNAPs (RNA polymerises) cannot melt the T7 promoter for the indicating gene due to the integration of the DNA double strands via the PTG molecules, manifesting the absence of the target nucleic acid and chemical molecule. While with the presence of the target nucleic acid and/or chemical molecule, the indicating gene would be expressed as the T7 promoter contained in the enlarged DNA bubble can be melted and transcribed by the bound RNAPs as the enlarged DNA bubble can help the separation of the two DNA strands, demonstrating the existence of target nucleic acid and/or chemical molecule.

AB This work proposes an approach for Cu2+ sensing in water which combines the selectivity of the Gly-Gly-His (GGH) peptide probe with the sensitivity of the electrolyte-gated organic field-effect transistor (EGOFET). The oligopeptide probe was immobilized onto the gate electrode of the transistor by electrooxidation of the primary amine of the glycine moiety. Cu2+ complexation by the grafted GGH was at first electrochemically evidenced, using cyclic and square wave voltammetries, then it was demonstrated that GGH-functionalized EGOFETs can transduce Cu2+ complexation through a significant threshold voltage shift and therefore a change in drain current. The limit of detection is ca. 10-12 M and the sensitivity in the linear range (10(-12) - 10(-8) M) is 1 mA dec(-2) (drain current variations).

AB Only surficial molecules of eletrochemiluminescent (ECL) nanomaterials are the most reactive species in the typical ECL reaction. Herein, monolayer rubrene was assembled on the surface of graphene sheet to obtain monolayer rubrene functionalized graphene composite (G/mRub) with strong ECL emission by maximizing the surficial rubrene molecules. Based on G/mRub as the strong ECL emitter, an ultrasensitive "on-off' biosensor was developed to detect cystatin C (Cys C) in human serum with the help of a novel immunorecognition-induced enzyme-free 3D DNA machine. Benefiting from the strong ECL emission of G/mRub and the efficient signal amplification of 3D DNA machine, the established biosensor achieved high sensitivity for Cys C detection with linear range from 1.0 fgml(-1) to 10 ng mL(-1) and limit of detection down to 0.38 fg mL(-1) in addition, this enzyme-free biosensing method was adopted to successfully detect the concentration of Cys C in human serum. Therefore, the G/mRub based ECL biosensor might provide a potential tool for protein detection in clinical diagnosis and a new avenue to prepare high-performance luminescent nanomaterials.

AB Quaternary chalcopyrite, i.e., Cu(2)ZuSnS(4) (CZTS) nanopartides films have been proposed as a novel matrix system for enzyme-based electrochemical biosensors providing a non-toxic, low-cost alternative for the fabrication of bioelectrodes. The easy tuneability of the band gap of CZTS by varying the cation ratio and size of nanoparticles facilitate to impart desirable electrical properties in the material. Butylamine capped spherical CZTS nanoparticles of size 15-16 nm and band gap 2.65 eV have been synthesized by colloidal hot injection technique. The films of CZTS onto ITO substrates are deposited using dip coating technique, and uricase enzyme have been immobilized onto CZTS films using EDC-NHS binding chemistry. Electrochemical analyses of this bioelectrode revealed that the uricase/CZTS/ITO/glass electrode exhibits good linearity over a wide range of 0-700 M uric acid concentration with a limit of detection (LOD) of 0.066 M. The low value of 0.13 x 10(-4) M of Michaelis-Menten constant (Km) indicate the enhanced affinity of inunobilized enzyme (uricase) towards uric acid. Thus, the present report confirms the promising application of the p-type CZTS thin film matrix for the realization of an electrochemical biosensor.

AB Early screening of foodborne pathogenic bacteria is a key to prevent and control foodborne diseases. This study intended to develop a capillary biosensor for rapid and sensitive detection of Salmonella using the multi-column capillary for easy operation, the Fe-nanoclusters (FNCs) for signal amplification and the smart phone APP for image analysis. The multi-column capillary was successively preloaded the magnetic nanoparticle (MNP) column, the FNC column, two phosphate buffer solution with 0.05% Tween 20 (PBST) columns and the MI column and the columns were separated by air gap. The iron spiral mixer was fabricated to accelerate the mixing, and the multi-ring magnets was developed to transfer the MNPs and their conjugates from column to column. The target bacteria were captured by the MNPs to form the magnetic bacteria and then conjugated with the FNCs to form the nanocluster bacteria. After washing with PBST, the nanocluster bacteria were transferred into the FICI column, and the iron ions were released and reacted with potassium hexacyanoferrate to form the Prussian Blue, which was finally measured and analyzed using the Hue-Saturation-Lightness color space based smartphone APP for the determination of the target bacteria. This proposed biosensor exhibited a wide linear range for detection of Salmonella typhhswriwn with the lower detection limit of 14 CFU/mL. The mean recovery of the target bacteria in spiked chicken samples was 105.0%, indicating the applicability of this biosensor. The proposed biosensor had the potential for in-field detection of foodborne pathogens,

AB Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) are a type of flame retardants which are currently banned in EU and USA due their hazardousness for humans and mammals. However, these compounds were highly used during more than 30 years and still persist in the environment since they are resistant to degradation. Herein we present a biosensor for the detection of PBDEs using screen printed carbon electrodes (SPCEs) based on the electrochemical monitoring of water oxidation reaction (WOR) catalyzed by iridium oxide (IV) nanoparticles (IrO2 NPs). Our assay shows a limit of detection of 21.5 ppb of PBDE in distilled water, We believe that such an IrO2 NPs-based electrocatalytic sensing system can lead to a rapid, sensitive, low cost and miniaturizable device for the detection of PBDEs.

AB We herein developed a novel electrochemical biosensor to detect DNA methylation level, and to quantitatively analyze multiple methylated sites. Graphene oxide was modified with anti-5-methylcytosine antibody to specifically bind CpG methylation sites, and horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-labeled IgG secondary antibody was bound to the former antibody. In buffer containing H2O2 and hydroquinone, HRP-IgG catalyzed the oxidation of hydroquinone into benzoquinone over H2O2, thereby generating electrochemical reduction signals. The number of 5-methylcytosine was directly proportional to current signal, thereby allowing accurate quantification of methylation level. We also analyzed monomethylated target sequences with different sites, After different methylated sites were captured by the probe, the steric hindrance differences between -CH3 hydrophobic sphere and the electrode surface were induced. The peak current decreased with reducing distance from the electrode surface, so DNA methylation sites were identified by measuring corresponding peak current responses. With a low detection limit (1 fM), this DNA biosensor was suitable for ultrasensitive DNA methylation detection. The linear detection range was 10(-15) M to 10(-8) M. Meanwhile, this method had high specificity, stability and repeatability, thus being widely applicable to the clinical detection of DNA methylation.

AB In general, the traditional impedimetric aptasensor for detecting protein is based on its high molecular weight and low dielectric constant. Yet, the efficiency of these aptasensors is hindered by the slight resistance change in the trace concentration range because of the high initial resistance (the electrostatic repulsion between the compact negatively charged DNA on the electrode and [Fe(CN)(6)](3-/4-)). To effectively and simply circumvent this issue and improve the detection sensitivity, we design an impedimetric aptasensor by reducing the substrate DNA's density on the electrode through the target-inspired recycling DNA cleavage. In order to enlarge the differences in resistance, the polyacrylic acid (PAA) nanogel is implemented as amplifier due to its poor conduction and negative charge that can hinder electron transfer and repulse the mediator [Fe(CN)(6)](3-/4-), respectively. Based on the target-inspired DNAzyme and PAA nanogel as amplifier, the ultrasensitive impedimetric aptasensor of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) in the buffer solution possesses a wide dynamic range of 10 fg mL(-1) to 10 ng mL(-1) and ultra-low detection limit of 7.9 fg mL(-1) (10-fold relative to equivalent aptasensors). When tested in human serum, the proposed aptasensor exhibits good performance with an ultra-low detection limit of 1.9 fg mL(-1), which is slightly higher than that in buffer solution.

AB Herein, a novel and pragmatic electrochemiluminescence (ECL) biosensing method was developed for ultra sensitive and specific detection of Group B Streptococci (GBS) by combining self-enhanced luminol complex functionalized CuMn-CeO2 (CuMn-CeO2-PEI-luminol) with MNAzyme-mediated target-recycling amplification. First, the efficient self-enhanced PEI-luminol luminophore was prepared by combining PEI co-reactant with luminol in one molecular, which shortened electron transfer distance and enhanced ECL signal. And CuMn-CeO2 was applied to load a large number of PEI-luminol and strengthen luminous efficiency of luminol by the high catalytic activity toward H2O2 oxidation. Then, target-driven MNAzyme system was used to realize the circulation of GBS nucleic acid sequence, producing plentiful triggers to initiate the hybridization reaction on the surface of electrode. The developed enzyme-free ECL biosensor showed ultra-sensitivity for target DNA detection with detection limits of 68 aM (synthetic DNA) and 5 x 10(2) CFU mL(-1) (genomic DNA extracted from GBS strain). More importantly, this biosensor was successfully applied for detection of genomic DNA of GBS extracted from clinical vaginal/anal swabs as low as 320 copies. Thus, this proposed strategy might be an pragmatic ECL platform for ultrasensitive and specific detection of GBS in clinical vaginal/anal swabs.

AB A label-free electrochemical immunosensor for quantitative detection of human epididymis specific protein 4 antigen (HE4 Ag) was developed by a novel multi-amplification signal system. The multi-amplification signal system was formed by loading bimetallic Au@Pd holothurian-shaped nanoparticles (Au@Pd HSs) on titanium oxide nanoclusters functionalized nitrogen-doped reduced graphene oxide (TiO2-NGO). The Au@Pd HSs were obtained via seed-mediated approach with in-situ grown palladium nanoarms on gold nanorods (Au Nits) surfaces, which possessed good electrocatalysis for hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) reduction and excellent biocompatibility. The TiO2-NGO with the high catalytic activity and large specific surface area was synthesized by hydrothermal method. Using H2O2 as an electrochemically active substrate, the prepared label-free electrochemical immunosensor based on the TiO2-NGO/Au@Pd HSs hetero-nanostructures as the signal amplification platform exhibited excellent selectivity, reproducibility and stability for the detection of HE4 Ag. Meanwhile, the linear range from 40 fM to 60 nM with the detection limit of 13.33 fM (S/N = 3) was obtained, Indicating the immunosensor offers a promising method for clinical detection of HE4 Ag.

AB A new type of nitrogen-doped carbon nanotube embedded cobalt nanoparticles nanopolyhedra (Co-NCNTNP) electrocatalyst synthesized via pyrolysis bimetallic metal-organic frameworks was investigated to modify the activated carbon air-cathode microbial fuel cell (MFC). X-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscope characterization confirmed the combination of nitrogen-doped carbon nanotube and transition metal element in Co-NCNTNP. Rotating disk electrode measurement revealed the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) of as-prepared Co-NCNTNP was mainly proceeded via a four-electron pathway like Pt/C. When fabricated into activated carbon cathode, the optimized MFC reached the maximum power density of 2252 +/- 46 mW m(-2), which was 154% higher than that of control. Moreover, the resistance including total resistance and charge transfer resistance of modified cathode significantly decreased comparing to the control, which was beneficial to better MFC performance. Therefore, all attracting properties suggested that noble-metal-free and high-efficiency Co-NCNTNP could be considered as a Pt-alternative electrocatalyst for ORR in MFC.

AB DNA technology based bio-responsive nanomaterials have been widely studied as promising tools for biomedical applications. Gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) and graphene oxide (GO) sheets are representative zero- and two-dimensional nanomaterials that have long been combined with DNA technology for point-of-care diagnostics. Herein, a cascade amplification system based on duplex-specific nuclease (DSN)-assisted target recycling and electrocatalytic water-splitting is demonstrated for the detection of microRNA. Target microRNAs can form DNA: RNA heteroduplexes with DNA probes on the surface of AuNPs, which can be hydrolyzed by DSN. MicroRNAs are preserved during the reaction and released into the suspension for the digestion of multiple DNA probes. After the DSN-based reaction, AuNPs are collected and mixed with GO to form AuNP/GO nanocomposite on an electrode for the following electrocatalytic amplification. The utilization of AuNP/GO nanocomposite offers large surface area, exceptional affinity to water molecules, and facilitated mass diffusion for the water-splitting reaction. For let-7b detection, the proposed biosensor achieved a limit detection of 1.5 fM in 80 min with a linear detection range of approximately four orders of magnitude. Moreover, it has the capability of discriminating non-target microRNAs containing even single-nucleotide mismatches, thus holding considerable potential for clinical diagnostics.

AB Here, we report an electrochemical sensor for rapid and sensitive detection of octamer-binding transcription factor 4 (Oct4) in human tissue samples by utilizing a designed tetrahedral DNA nanostructure (TDN). En the design, the TDN is also extended with two additional strands from two vertices. When Oct4 is absent, the strands are linked together by complementary pairing bases. Owing to the rigid structure of TDN, contact of the redox labels on the signal strand and electrode surface is greatly prohibited, resulting in a lower electrochemical signal. However, the specific binding of Oct4 to the edge of the tetrahedron will liberate the signal strand and increase the redox current dramatically. Experimental results reveal that the proposed sensor shows a linear range of 0.5-1000 ng/mL with a detection limit of 60 pg/mL. Moreover, it can be directly applied to clinical sample detection. This sensor can also achieve one-step detection of Oct4 In less than 30 min. Furthermore, through replacing the binding site, this sensor can be easily extended to a wide application range of DNA binding proteins.

AB Amine group-bearing small molecules tend to adsorb onto the nanochannel surfaces, which degrades the efficiency of nanochannel sensors. In this study, we utilized host-guest knowledge to eliminate the influence of excessive small molecules. In combination with single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs), beta-cyclodextrin (beta-CD) provided an excellent sensing performance for the conical nanochannel coated with polyethyleneimine (PEI) and zirconium ion (Zr4+). By taking detection of melamine as a prototype, the as-prepared nanochannel could selectively detect melamine-elicited double-stranded DNA (dsDNA). Both excessive melamine and single-stranded DNA were removed via the addition of beta-CD and SWNTs. The nanochannel sensing platform for the detection of melamine has a detection limit of as low as 4.3 nM with a suitable sensitivity, an excellent reproducibility and stability. Therefore, it is highly promising that a nanochannel sensor based on ion current rectification (ICR) can be used to detect other possible targets.

AB This work describes a hybrid electrochemical sensor for highly sensitive detection of pesticide cypermethrin (CYP). Firstly, Ag and N co-doped zinc oxide (Ag-N@ZnO) was produced by sol-gel method, and then Ag-N@ZnO was ultrasonically supported on activated carbon prepared from coconut husk (Ag-N@ZnO/CHAC). Finally, a layer of molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP) was in situ fabricated on glassy carbon electrode by electro-polymerization, with dopamine and resorcinol as dual functional monomers (DM), CYP acting as template (DMMIP-Ag-N@ZnO/CHAC). Morphological features, composition information and electrochemical properties of DM-MIP-Ag-N@ZnO/CHAC were investigated in detail. It is worth to mention that for the first time response surface method was used to investigate the effect of double monomers and to optimize the ratio between template and monomers. Compared with typical one-monomer involving MW, the MIP prepared with dual functional monomers (DMMIP) of monomers showed higher response and better selectivity. Under the optimal conditions, a calibration curve of current shift versus concentration of CYP was obtained in the range of 2 x 10(-13)-8 x 10(-9) M, and the developed sensor gave a remarkably low detection limit (LOD) of 6.7 x 10(-14) M (S/N = 3). Determination of CYP in real samples was conducted quickly and accurately with our sensor. The DMMIP-Ag-N@ZnO/CHAC electrochemical sensor proposed in this paper has great potential in food safety, drug residue determination and environmental monitoring.

AB We demonstrated here that molecular redox films are electrochemical capacitive devices possessing specific field effect in which molecular moieties within films act as sensitive gates. We confirm that the field effect present in these redox switches is suitable in detecting, in a label-free manner (without needs of redox probe in the biological samples), biomarkers of essential importance for dengue, heart risks and inflammation, Parkinson's disease and tumors. Though the sensitiveness is high, it is governed by Thomas Fermi screening and thus depends on the target-to-receptor size ratio. Thus, we also demonstrated how this target-to-receptor size ratio affects the sensitivity. We concluded that the smaller the biological receptor the greater the sensitivity. Consequently, a larger molecular target associated with a smaller receptor provides a considerable (predictable) improvement of the sensitiveness.

AB Detection of staphylococcal enterotoxin B (SEB) as a bacterial toxin causing severe food poisoning is of great importance. Herein, we developed an electrochemical aptasensor for SEB detection using a screen printed electrode modified with reduced graphene oxide (rGO) and gold nano-urchins (AuNUs). Afterward, the single stranded DNA probe was attached to the surface of AuNUs on the modified electrode and then the specific aptamer was attached to the probe. In the presence of SEB molecules, the aptamer detached from the electrode surface and after applying the electrochemical signal generator, hematoxylin and the peak current of differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) were recorded, Due to the intercalation mechanism of hematoxylin-DNA interaction, the detachment of aptamer from electrode surface decreased the DPV peak current and the calibration graph (peak current vs SEB concentration) can be used for quantification of SEB. The cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and also field emission scanning electron microscope imaging were used for electrode characterization. Selectivity experiments of the developed aptasensor showed a very distinct difference between SEB and other nonspecific molecules. A wide linear range from 5.0 to 500.0 fM was achieved and the detection limit was calculated as 0.21 fM. The performance of the aptasensor was checked in spiked food samples as simulated real samples and the results showed no significant difference compared to the synthetic samples. Results of selectivity and repeatability of the aptasensor were satisfactory. In addition, better recovery percentages and also lower standard deviation of aptasensor compared to a commercial ELISA kit of SEB detection proved the superior performance of the proposed aptasensor.

AB The work presented here describes the development of an optical label-free biosensor based on a porous silicon (PSi) Bragg reflector to study heterogeneity in single cells. Photolithographic patterning of a poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) hydrogel with a photoinitiator was employed on RGD peptide-modified PSi to create micropatterns with cell adhesive and cell repellent areas. Macrophage J774 cells were incubated to form cell microarrays and single cell arrays. Moreover, cells on the microarrays were lysed osmotically with Milli-Q (TM) water and the infiltration of cell lysate into the porous matrix was monitored by measuring the red shift in the reflectivity. On average, the magnitude of red shift increased with the increase in the number of cells on the micropatterns. The red shift from the spots with single cells varied from spot to spot emphasizing the heterogeneous nature of the individual cells.

AB The fabrication of photosensitive interface and molecular recognition layer at the biosensing surface are of vital importance in photoelectrochemical (PEC) biosensor construction. Developing facial methods with favorable biomolecule immobilization as well as excellent photoelectric activity still need to be explored. In this work, by integration of the merits of tungsten oxide (WO3) semiconductor nanomaterial and polydopamine (PDA) polymer, a novel biofunctional PDA/WO3 nanocomposites (PDA/WO3 NCs) modified ITO hierarchical architecture was fabricated by simple thermal annealing and self-polymerization methods. The proposed PEC biosensor platform based on PDA/WO3/ITO not only have preponderances in simple preparation, but also possesses excellent PEC activity, high specific surface area and good microenvironment for biomolecule immobilization. Utilizing CYFRA 21-1 as a model target, label-free PEC immunosensor was developed successfully, which exhibited great sensitivity and broad dynamic range with four orders of magnitude (10 pg mL(-1) to 100 ng mL(-1)), and the limit of detection was as low as 2.5 pg mL(-1). Moreover, owing to the great sensitivity and selectivity of the proposed platform, this convenient sensor also performed well in real serum sample analysis. It is worth noting that our work not only helps in gaining a better understanding of the applicability of the PEC properties of PDA/WO3 NCs, but also sheds novel light on the design and development of PEC biosensing platform based on PDA/WO3 NCs.

AB An ultrahigh sensitive, simple and reliable Electrochemiluminescence (ECL) immunosensor for selective quantification of p53 protein was designed according to the enhancement effects of AuNPs on ECL emission of CdS nanocrystals (CdS NCs). CdS NCs were immobilized on the glassy carbon electrode and AuNPs introduced to the process through formation of a sandwich-type immunocomplex between first anti-p53/p53/ secondary anti-p53. ECL of CdS NCs firstly evoked the SPR of AuNPs which in return amplified the CdS NCs ECL intensity. By using graphene oxide in immunosensor fabrication procedure, and attaching more AuNPs on the surface of the electrode, the ECL intensity was further increased resulting in much higher sensitivity. After applying the optimum conditions, the linear range of the developed immunosensor was found between 20 and 1000 fg/ml with a calculated limit of detection of 4 fg/ml. Moreover, the interference, reproducibility and storage stability studies of the immunosensor were investigated. Finally, immunosensor's authenticity was evaluated by detecting the p53 protein in human spikes which offers it as a potential in early detection of cancer, monitoring the cancer progress and clinical prognosis.

AB Advances in nanostructured materials have facilitated the development of novel sensitive techniques for detection of environmental and clinical analytes. There is immense need for development of devices that can detect analytes at concentrations as low as few pg mL(-1). The comparable size of nanostructured materials and biomolecules enabled the integration of biological systems with nanometer sized structures. Herein, we demonstrate a Zinc Oxide nanorods (ZnONRs) integrated ultrasensitive label-free biosensor with femtomolar (0.01 pg mL(-1)) sensitivity for the endocrine disruptor 17 beta-Estradiol (E2). The ZnONRs, average width 50 nm and length 325 nm, were grown on the silver electrode surface (Ag-ZnONRs). Monoclonal antibodies of E2 (mAb-E2) were covalently immobilized on ZnONRs surface and measured using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). A linear detection range of 0.1-200 pg mL(-1) for E2 with R-2 = 0.99 and % RSD = 4.35 (n = 3, assay volume 90 mu L) was achieved for the developed nano-sensing system. A significant enhancement in the sensitivity was achieved in the presence of ZnONRs, enabling the limit of quantification down to 0.1 pg(-1) with 2.7 % capacitance change per decade. In addition, a further increase in sensitivity due to assay volume reduction (20 mu L) was observed enabling further scope of miniaturization.

AB In this study, we propose a SnO2/CdCO3/CdS-based label-free photoelectrochemical (PEC) immunosensor for the sensitive quantification of amyloid beta-protein (A beta) which plays a critical role in the early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease. Under specific pH conditions, SnO2/CdCO3/CdS was first designed and successfully synthesized with simple one-pot method. The synthesis of SnO2/CdCO3/CdS circumvents the trouble of traditional composite materials to be gradually compounded, saving a lot of time and energy. The synthesis mechanism of SnO2/CdCO3/CdS nanocomposite was also deeply explored. Moreover, thanks to the matched energy levels of its three components, SnO2/CdCO3/CdS nanocomposite exhibited enhanced photocurrent intensity, which is dozens of times bigger than any of its components, thus making it an excellent photoactive matrix for PEC immunosensor. Under optimal conditions, the as-constructed PEC immunosensor manifested a broad linear range (0.1 pg mL(-1) to 100 ng mL(-1)) with a low detection limit (LOD, 0.05 pg mL(-1), S/N = 3). High selectivity, coupled with good stability, allowed the developed PEC immunosensor to be applied in the clinical detection of All or other biomarkers in human serum.

AB Black phosphorus (BP), also known as phosphorene (PP), is a fascinating two-dimensional (2D) material with extraordinary anisotropic mechanical, electronic and optoelectronic properties. However, PP is sensitive to oxygen and moisture and is completely degenerated by oxygen and humid air within 12 h, which limits its applications. Here, we coat PP with hexamethylenediamine (HMA), which allows the coated PP to maintain its original form in aqueous solution for over one month. The stable PP is dotted with gold nanoparticles to facilitate binding to a 3,3'4,4'-polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB77) aptamer (ap) as a biosensor. The aptamer biosensor based on gold nanoparticle-dotted PP nanocomposites (PP-AuNPs) exhibits superior analytical performance, and its sensitivity (391.1 mu A cm(-2)) is approximately three times higher than that of an AuNP-based sensor (AuNP-Ap/Au electrode, 147.2 mu A cm(-2)). This biosensor has a low detection limit (DL) of 33 pg L-1 toward PCB77 with a dynamic response range toward PCB77 from 100 pg L-1 to 10 mu g L-1. This research opens up avenues for the use of PP to make multiplexed diagnosis platforms in aqueous systems.

AB We present a novel vertical flow-based paper immunosensor for the rapid and sensitive electrochemical and colorimetric detection of influenza H1N1 viruses using a different pore size (DP) sample pad. The DP sample pad consisted of two different pore size papers: larger pores (diameter: 11 mu m) facing the inlet, and smaller pores (diameter: 0.45 mu m) facing the conjugate pad. This sample pad offered moderate and uniform flows, and hence concentrated horseradish peroxidase tagged antibodies (HRP-Abs)-H1N1 complexes from 40 mu L of sample volumes on a conjugate pad for 2 min after sample injection, thereby providing fast detection (6 min for both detection methods) with 100 mu L of flushing afterwards, high sensitivity, and the simplicity of the sensor. The filtration characteristics of the DP sample pad were evaluated using fluorescent beads, indicating that only small sized bio-particles such as viruses can pass through the sample pad. Sandwich immunoreactions of HRP-Ab-H1N1-Ab were performed on the gold paper electrode of the immunoStrip, which was determined by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements. Simultaneously, the color signal of free HRP-Ab captured on the colorimetric zone was obtained using a scanner, and the intensity was analyzed using ImageJ. This immunosensor detected H1N1 virus concentration as low as 3.3 plaque forming units (PFU)/mL (phosphate buffer saline; PBS) and 4.7 PFU/mL (saliva) by EIS, and 1.34 PFU/mL (PBS) and 2.27 PFU/mL (saliva) by the colorimetric method. Furthermore, integrating these two detection methods can reduce false results with double assurance, and this device can provide a simple and economical on-site detection platform.

AB Even though lanthanide ion (Ln(3+))-doped DNA nanostructures have been utilized in various applications, they are rarely employed for photovoltage generating devices because of difficulties in designing DNA-based devices that generate voltages under light illumination. Here, we constructed DNA lattices made of synthetic strands and DNA thin films extracted from salmon (SDNA) with single-doping of Nd3+ or Er3+ and co-doping of Nd3+/Er3+ for high performance UV detection. The topological change of the DNA double-crossover (DX) lattices during the course of annealing was estimated from atomic force microscope (AFM) images to find the optimum concentration of Ln(3+) ([Ln(3+)](o)). No topological disturbance in DNA DX lattices were observed up to [Ln(3+)](o), and significant enhancement in the physical properties was obtained at [Ln(3+)](o). The interactions between Ln(3+) and SDNA were examined using spectroscopic methods of UV visible, Raman, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Current and photovoltage measurements for Ln(3+)-doped SDNA thin films under UV illumination with varying power intensities were conducted. Under UV illumination, the photocurrent and photovoltage of Ln(3+) doped SDNA thin films increased with increasing applied external voltages and input power intensities, respectively. In addition, we observed considerable increases in photovoltage responses, i.e., 5-fold increase for Nd3+, 10-fold for Er3+, and 13-fold for Nd3+/Er3+, compared to the pristine SDNA due to the additional charge carriers generated in Ln(3+)-doped SDNA thin films. Device performance was measured in terms of photovoltage responsivity and retention characteristics. These phenomena indicate the high stability and substantial endurance characteristics of Ln(3+)-doped SDNA thin films.

AB A highly sensitive whole cell based electrochemical biosensor was developed for catechol detection in this study. The carE gene of Sphingobium yanoikuyae XLDN2-5 encoding catechol 2,3-dioxygenase (C23O), a key enzyme in the biodegradation of aromatic compound, was cloned and over-expressed in Escherichia coli. BL21 (E. coli BL21). Compared to Sphingobium yanoikuyae XLDN2-5, the recombinant E. coil BL21 over-expressed C23O exhibited higher catalytic activity towards catechol. Moreover, the whole cells provided a better environment for C23O to maintain its catalytic activity and stability compared with crude enzyme. The distinctive features of the recombinant E. coil BL21 over-expressed C23O made it an ideal bio-recognition element for the fabrication of a microbial biosensor. Additionally, nanoporous gold (NPG) with unique properties of structure and function was selected as a support to immobilized the recombinant E. con BL21 over-expressed C23O. Based on the synergistic effect of C23O and NPG, the E. coil BL21-C23O/NPG/GCE bioelectrode showed a good linear response for catechol detection ranging from 1 mu M to 500 mu M with a high sensitivity of 332.24 mu A mM(-1) cm(-2) and a low detection limit of 0.24 mu M. Besides, the E. coil BL21-C23O/NPG/GCE bioelectrode exhibited strong anti-interference and good stability. For the detection of catechol in wastewater samples, the concentrations detected by the E. coli BL21-C23O/NPG/GCE bioelectrode were in good agreement with the standard concentrations that added in the wastewater samples, which make the E. coli BL21-C23O/NPG/GCE bioelectrode an ideal tool for reliable catechol detection.

AB Graphene field-effect transistor (GFET) sensors are an attractive analytical tool for the detection of water pollutants. Unfortunately, this application has been hindered by the sensitivity of such sensors to nonspecific disturbances caused by variations of environmental conditions. Incorporation of differential designs is a logical choice to address this issue, but this has been difficult for GFET sensors due to the impact of fabrication processes and material properties. This paper presents a differential GFET affinity sensor for the selective detection of water pollutants in the presence of nonspecific disturbances. This differential design allows for minimization of the effects of variations of environmental conditions on the measurement accuracy. In addition, to mitigate the impact of the fabrication process and material property variations, we introduce a compensation scheme for the individual sensing units of the sensor, so that such variations are accounted for in the compensation-based differential sensing method. We test the use of this differential sensor for the selective detection of the water pollutant 17 beta-estradiol in buffer and tap water. Consistent detection results can be obtained with and without interferences of pH variations, and in tap water where unknown interferences are present. These results demonstrate that the differential graphene affinity sensor is capable of effectively mitigating the effects of nonspecific interferences to enable selective water pollutant detection for water quality monitoring.

AB Electrogenerated chemiluminescence (ECL) is an effective method for detecting a wide range of analytes including metal ions, virulent DNA, pathogenic bacteria, tumor cells and glucose. The attractive features of paper including passive liquid transport and biocompatibility are the main two advantages of using paper as a biosensing platform. To achieve key factors in paper-based sensors, the fabrication procedures and the analysis methods are fine tuned to satisfy the requirements of the ultimate-users. Here, we review various ECL signal amplification labels, inexpensive and portable devices, such as rechargeable batteries, which have replaced traditional instrumentation and different light detection technologies used in paper ECL devices. We also highlight the current trends and developments in ECL paper-based microfluidic analytical devices, as well as recent applications of ECL-based detection methods and inexpensive microfluidic devices. We discuss various paper-based devices, including 3D-origami devices, and devices utilizing self-powered and bipolar electrodes. Significant efforts have also been dedicated towards paper based multiplexing analysis (multi-label, and the multi-analyte strategies) and integration of microfluidic lab-on-paper devices with competences for point-to-care diagnostics. This review finally tabulates systematized data on figures of merit and novel types of ECL labels, used for detection of various biomarkers and analytes.

AB We report a lab-on-a-chip immunosesnor for quantification of the inflammatory cytokine TNF-alpha with picomolar sensitivity. The feasibility of the technology was demonstrated via accurate measurement of the concentration of TNF-alpha in astrocytes cell culture media. The immunoassay was performed in a microfluidic device with an integrated antimony/bismuth thermopile sensor and had a limit of detection of 14 pg(-1). The device was fabricated using rapid prototyping xurography technique and consisted of two inlets and single outlet. Anti-TNF-alpha monoclonal antibody was used to capture the analyte while the detection was performed using glucose oxidase-conjugated secondary antibody. Glucose (55 mM) was injected through a sample loop into the fluid flowing within the microfluidic device. A nanovolt meter connected to the thermoelectric sensor recorded the voltage change caused by the enzymatic reaction. Computer simulations using COMSOL Multiphysics were performed to analyze the effect of fluid velocity on the concentration of glucose within the reaction zone. A standard calibration curve was created using serial dilutions of synthetic TNF-alpha (0-2000 pg mL(-1)) by plotting the area under the curve of the signal versus the concentration of the analyte. The efficacy of the device was evaluated by quantifying TNF-alpha in the cell culture medium of lipopolysaccharide stimulated and non-stimulated astrocytes. The results demonstrated high accuracy of the calorimetric immunoassay when compared with gold standard commercial ELISA microplate reader. The immunosensor offers excellent reproducibility, accuracy, and versatility in the choice of the detection enzyme.

AB Nanoporous alumina membranes have become a ubiquitous biosensing platform for a variety of applications and aptamers are being increasingly utilized as recognition elements in protein sensing devices. Combining the advantages of the two, we report label-free sensitive detection of human alpha-thrombin by an aptamer-functionalized nanoporous alumina membrane using a four-electrode electrochemical cell. The sensor response to alpha-thrombin was determined in the presence of a high concentration (500 mu M) of human serum albumin (HSA) as an interfering protein in the background. The sensor sensitivity was also characterized against gamma-thrombin, which is a modified alpha-thrombin lacking the aptamer binding epitope. The detection limit, within an appreciable signal/noise ratio, was 10 pM of alpha-thrombin in presence of 500 mu M HSA. The proposed scheme involves the use of minimum reagents/sample preparation steps, has appreciable response in presence of high concentrations of interfering molecules and is readily amenable to miniaturization by association with existing-chip based electrical systems for application in point-of-care diagnostic devices.

AB Elevated hydrogen sulfide (H2S) level is closely associated with various diseases. So the sensing of H2S is noteworthy for divulging its role in diagnosing these diseases. Herein, we proposed poly(acrylic acid)-modified upconversion nanoparticles assembled with cationic near-infrared cyanine chromophores (Cy7-Cl) as the nanoprobe (Cy7-UCNPs) for monitoring H2S based on thiolation reactions. The presence of H2S resulted into about five-fold enhancement in the luminescence intensity of Cy7-UCNPs and the nanoprobe showed a good linearity (R-2 = 0.9952) over the range of 1.0 - 90 mu M. Furthermore, Cy7-UCNPs were successfully employed in sensing and imaging of exogenous and endogenous H2S in live cells and zebrafish. The system shows great potential in the field of nanobiomedicine because of the many excellent properties including high sensitivity, good selectivity, and low cytotoxicity.

AB In this paper we report on a bisulfite treatment and PCR amplification-free method for sensitive and selective quantifying of global DNA methylation. Our method utilizes a three-step strategy that involves (i) initial isolation and denaturation of global DNA using the standard isolation protocol and direct adsorption onto a bare gold electrode via gold-DNA affinity interaction, (ii) selective interrogation of methylation sites in adsorbed DNA via methylation-specific 5mC antibody, and (iii) subsequent signal enhancement using an electrochemical-enzymatic redox cycling reaction. In the redox cycling reaction, glucose oxidase (GO(x)) Is used as an enzyme label, glucose as a substrate and ruthenium complex as a redox mediator. We initially investigated the enzymatic properties of GO(x) by varying glucose and ruthenium concentration to delineate the redox cyclic mechanism of our assay. Because of the fast electron transfer by ruthenium (Ru) complex and intrinsic signal amplification from GO(x) label, this method could detect as low as 5% methylation level in 50 ng of total DNA input. Moreover, the use of methylation-specific 5mC antibody conjugated GO(x) makes this assay relatively highly selective for DNA methylation analysis. The data obtained from the electrochemical response for different levels of methylation showed excellent interassay reproducibility of RSD (relative standard deviation) < 5% for n = 3. We believe that this inexpensive, rapid, and sensitive assay will find high relevance as an alternative method for DNA methylation analysis both in research and clinical platforms.

AB Here, a novel H2O2-based electrochemical immunosensor utilizing Pd nanoparticles functionalized three-dimensional wrinkly amorphous MoSx composites (Pd NPs@3D MoSx) as the platform was developed for the determination of insulin. In this work, Pd NPs@3D MoSx prepared in the presence of CTAB possessed an excellent catalytic activity for the reduction of H2O2. Furthermore, Pd NPs@3D MoSx with favorable biological compatibility can conjugate a great many antibodies to capture insulin. Attributed to the excellent property, electrochemical signals could be greatly amplified, contributing to improving detection sensitivity. Especially, SEM, TEM, and XPS information further confirmed nanomaterial's surface morphology and amorphous structure. Under the optimal conditions, the proposed immunosensor exhibited a sensitively linear relation with logarithmic insulin concentrations from 0.01 to 100 ng/mL with a low detection limit of 3.0 pg/mL (S/N = 3). Characterized by good reproducibility, specificity, and stability, the fabricated immunosensor may blaze a path for insulin detection in a real sample.

AB Bilirubin is predominantly formed in the liver as a result of breakdown of hemoglobin. Knowing the concentration of bilirubin in serum is important in evaluating the health of the liver, and for the diagnosis of hyperbilirubinemia (a condition that afflicts approximately 60% of full-term and 80% of pre-term newborns). This paper describes the design and fabrication of a potentiometric sensor for the determination of free bilirubin in serum. The sensor has a polymeric ion-selective membrane, and selectively measures free ionic bilirubin ("unbound" bilirubin - i.e., bilirubin not complexed to albumin or other complexing agents), in the presence of other anions - chloride, phosphate, pyruvate, deoxycholate, and lactate - also present in serum. The linear response range of the sensor (1.0 mM to 0.10 mu M bilirubin, measured in a sodium phosphate buffer with pH 8.6) covers the clinically-relevant concentration of bilinibin in serum (5-500 mu M). Free bilirubin could be detected in human blood serum with this potentiometric sensor. The components of the potentiometric bilirubin sensor were embedded in a paper-based device to provide a sensor that is disposable and easy to use, and thus is suitable for applications at the point-of-care. The paper-based potentiometric bilirubin sensor exhibited a response range of 5.0-0.10 mM (sufficient to cover the clinically-relevant concentration of bilirubin in serum). Only 15 mu M of sample is required for measurement of the concentration of free bilirubin, and the analysis can be performed in less than two minutes.

AB This research aims to develop biosensors which could diagnose periodontal diseases in early phases and predict the illness stage of patients, in order to give them adequate treatment timely. Human odontogenic ameloblast-associated protein (ODAM) is considered to be a potential biomarker for periodontal diseases, based on high correlation between the level of ODAM in gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) and the degree of periodontitis. Many aptamers, including a cognate pair of aptamers which can bind to the different sites of ODAM, were successfully screened in a very stringent condition employing saliva as a counter target through the graphene oxide-based systemic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (GO-SELEX). For the characterization of the aptamer candidates, GO-based fluorescence resonance energy transfer (GO-FRET) and surface plasmon resonance (SPR) assays were conducted. The sandwich-type binding of a cognate pair of aptamers to ODAM was additionally confirmed by employing circular dichroism (CD) and magnetic beads-based fluorescence imaging methods. The resulting cognate pair of aptamers, OD64 and OD35, were found to have their dissociation constant (Kd), 47.71 nM and 51.36 nM, respectively. The minimum detectable concentrations of a sandwich-type SPR biosensor were found to be 0.24 nM and 1.63 nM, respectively, for both buffered and saliva samples. Finally, using this cognate pair of aptamers, a sandwich-type lateral flow strip biosensor was successfully realized. This research shows the potential for implementation of a cognate pair of aptamers on point-of-care biosensors which enables simple, rapid, and non-invasive saliva-based diagnosis of periodontal-related diseases that can overcome current diagnostic methods and improve health care system.

AB Intracellular pH (pHi) plays a crucial role in cell physiological and pathological processes. We herein report an efficient pH-sensitive sensor based on two-photon excitable semiconducting polymer nanoparticles (PFV/PSMA-DA NPs) for pHi sensing. PFV/PSMA NPs were functionalized with redox-active dopamine (DA) and the obtained PFV/PSMA-DA NPs showed sensitive and reversible pH response over the pH range of 5.0-9.0. Owning to the high biocompatibility and pH-responsive DA, PFV/PSMA-DA NPs show low cytotoxicity and the quantification and imaging of intracellular pH changes of HeLa cells were successfully realized. Moreover, the detection of intracellular pH fluctuation induced by redox species such as NAC (N-acetylcysteine) and H2O2 was also achieved by both one- and two-photon excitation of the PFV/PSMA-DA NPs probe. This work clearly shows that nanoprobe based on two-photon PFV/PSMA-DA NPs could serve as a promising platform for quantitatively monitoring the intracellular pH fluctuations.

AB Reduced graphene oxide (s-GO) thin films can be exploited as highly sensitive transducer layers and integrated in interdigital micro-electrode systems for biosensing processes. The distinctive bipolar characterisitics of rGO thin films can be modulated by a very low external electric field due to the electrostatic charges of biomolecules. These charges lead to a fast response in the readout signals of rGO based ion sensitive field-effect transistors (ISFETs). The characterisitc changes of rGO ISFETs enable a fast, accurate and reproducible detection of biomolecules. The biosensing mechanism offers a fast and label-free approach for analyte detection in contrast to the classical ELISA method.
   In this contribution, we introduce a reproducible fabrication process of rGO based field-effect transistors on wafer level. The sensors are functionalized as biosensors to measure N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) in human serum within its clinical range. Our optimized rGO sensor shows very promising electrical properties and can be considered as a proof of concept study for the detection of various analytes. The easy and cost-effective fabrication as well as the versatile usability make this new technological platform an auspicious tool for different sensing applications in future.

AB A novel electrochemical aptasensor based on gold nanoparticles decorated on boron nitride nanosheets (AuNPs/BNNSs) for the sensitive and selective detection of myoglobin (Mb) is reported. BNNSs were chemically synthesized by a low-cost and simple hydrothermal method. They were deposited onto the fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) electrode by a spin-coating method. Subsequently, AuNPs were chemically deposited onto the BNNS/FTO electrode by a seed-mediated chemical reduction method, with an average particle size of approximately 10 nm. The AuNPs/BNNSs/FTO electrode was used as a transducer to immobilize a thiol-functionalized DNA aptamer (Apt) via the covalent interaction of Au-S for the specific binding of Mb. [Fe(CN)(6)](3-/4-) was used as a redox probe to monitor the oxidation current variation upon the binding of Mb with varying concentrations onto the sensor surface. The Apt/AuNPs/BNNSs/FTO sensor shows a high signal response for Mb with a detection limit of 34.6 ng/mL and a dynamic response range of 0.1-100 mu g/mL. It is a promising candidate for point-of-care diagnosis in real samples. This strategy could make possible the application of other 2D materials with wide bandgaps for the development of biosensors.

AB Enzyme-based electrochemical biosensors are widely used in immunoassays, but the intrinsic disadvantages of enzymes including instability or sensitivity to temperature and pH should be considered. Herein, an enzyme-free and dual-signal readout immunoassay was established to detect microcystin-LR (MC-LR) sensitively and selectively. Firstly, the microplate was modified with gold nanoparticles-decorated-carbon nanotubes (AuNP-CNT) to immobilize sufficient antigens by the high surface area of CNT and high affinity of AuNP. Then, silver nanoparticles were decorated on gold nanorods to form corn-like AgNP/AuNR composite and then capture secondary antibody and initiator DNA strand. After hybridization chain reaction, long double helix DNA strands can be formed on AgNP/AuNR to germinate copper nanoparticles. A dual-signal readout from the current responses of both silver and copper ions was obtained by using differential pulse stripping voltammetry with the aid of acid treatment, By using a competitive immunoreaction, MC-LR can be detected in a linear range from 0.005 mu g/L to 20 mu g/L with a lower detection limit of 2.8 mu g/L. The reproducibility, stability and specificity were all acceptable, indicating its promising application in environment monitoring and sensitive electrochemical detection for other analytes.

AB In this work, an ultra-sensing photoelectrochemical (PEC) glucose biosensor has been constructed from the bio-derived nitrogen-doped carbon sheets (NDC) wrapped titanium dioxide nanoparticles (NDC-TiO2 NPs) followed by the covalent immobilization of glucose oxidase (GODx) on them (designated as a GODx/NDC-TiO(2)NPs/ITO biosensor). Initially, the TiO2 NPs was synthesized by sol-gel method and then NDC-TiO2 NPs was synthesized utilizing a green source of Prunus persica (peach fruit) through a simple hydrothermal process. The synthesized NDC-TiO2 NPs composite was characterized by FESEM, HRTEM, Raman spectroscopy, XRD, ATR-FTIR spectroscopy and XPS to determine composition and phase purity. These fabricated GODx/NDC-TiO(2)NPs/ITO biosensor exhibited a good charge separation, highly enhanced and stable photocurrent responses with switching PEC behavior under the light (lambda > 400 nm). As a result, GODx/NDC-TiO(2)NPs/ITO PEC glucose sensor exhibits a good photocurrent response to detection of glucose concentrations (0.05-10 mu M) with an ultra-low detection limit of 13 nM under optimized PEC experimental conditions. Also, the PEC glucose sensor revealed a high selectivity, good stability, long time durability, and capability to analyze the glucose levels in real human serum. Also, the further development of this work may provide new insights into preparing other bio-derived carbon nanostructure-based photocatalysts for PEC applications.

AB In this study, the effect of inter-enzyme steric hindrance that occurs during enzyme immobilization on the electrode, on direct electrical communications of enzyme with electrode was investigated via nano-patterning of enzymes on the electrode. Here, the nano-patterning of enzymes was achieved through the combination of DET-capable enzyme that was produced via fusion of site-specific gold binding peptide (GBP) to catalytic subunit of enzyme and gold nanoparticle (AuNP) array with highly tunable dimensions of AuNPs, resulting in spatially controllable enzyme-electrode. The nano-scale spatial control between immobilized enzymes on the highly tuned AuNPs shows different DET efficiency across the enzyme-electrode interface, showing 18.47% of maximum electron recovery which is 3.2-fold enhanced electron recovery efficiency compared to spatially non-controlled enzymes on the electrode where showed 5.7% of electron recovery. The result affirms that inter enzyme interaction is a significant parameter that decides the enzyme-electrode performance.

AB Immune checkpoint blockade therapies are promising next generation immunotherapeutic treatments for cancer. Whilst sequential solid biopsies are an invaluable source of prognostic information, they are not feasible for monitoring therapeutic outcomes over time. Monitoring soluble immune checkpoint markers expression in body fluids could potentially be a better alternative. Current methods (e.g. ELISA) for detecting immune-checkpoint proteins mostly rely on the use of monoclonal antibodies which are expensive and time-consuming to manufacture and isolate. Herein, we report an integrated surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS)-microfluidics device for the detection of immune checkpoint proteins which involves the use of i) nano yeast single chain variable fragment (scFv) as a promising alternative to monoclonal antibodies providing high stability at relative low-cost and simplicity for production, ii) graphene oxide functionalised surface to reduces the bio functionalization steps, thus avoiding the general paradigm of biotin-streptavidin chemistry and iii) a microfluidic platform enabling alternating current electrohydrodynamics (ac-EHD) induced nanomixing to enhance the target scFv binding and minimize the non-specific interactions. Specific and multiplex detection of immune checkpoint biomarkers is achieved by SERS based spectral encoding. Using this platform, we successfully demonstrated the detection of clinically relevant soluble immune checkpoints PD-1, PD-Ll and LAG-3 from as low as 100 fg/mL of analytes spiked in human serum.

AB Herein, a novel electrochemical ultrasensitive immunosensor was designed for detecting prostate-specific antigen (PSA) with three-dimensional (3D) PtCu hollow nanoframes (PtCu HNFs) as signal amplification. The highly opened PtCu HNFs were synthesized by a one-pot solvothermal method with cetyltrimethylammonium chloride (CTAC) and trishydroxymethyl aminomethane (Tris) as co-structuring directors. The architectures enlarged the loading of prostate specific antibodies (Ab) and efficiently catalyzed hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) reaction, ultimately amplifying the signals. And polylysine was used to disperse PtCu HNFs, improve the biocompatibility and bind the Ab on the electrode surface. The fabricated immunosensor exhibited lower detection limit (0.003 ng mL(-1), S/N = 3), and wider linear range (0.01-100.0 ng mL(-1)), along with the improved reproducibility, selectivity and stability for the assay of PSA.

AB In vivo detecting of plants signal molecules is of great importance for the precision farming, crop management and plant phenotyping. In this work, for in vivo detecting indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), one of phytohormones, fine stainless steel (SS) wire was used as electrode material. Highly ordered nanopores, popcorn-like Au nanostructures, Pt nanoparticles and reduced graphene oxide (ERGO) nanocomposite films, and polymerized ST film (PST) were fabricated on the SS microelectrode in turn for improving the detection effect. Using the as-prepared SS microelectrode as working electrode, two untreated SS wires as reference electrode and counter electrode respectively, a disposable electrochemical microsensor for IAA were developed. The microsensor exhibited excellent selectivity and high sensitivity with low detection limit (LOD) of 43 pg mL(-1). The limit of quantity (LOQ) is 143 pg mL(-1). The RSD was 7% for 12 different PST/Pt-ERGO/Au/a-SS microsensors in presence of 100 mu g mL(-1) IAA. Using this microsensor, IAA of the stem of soybean seedlings was detected in vivo under salt stress. Our result was also confirmed by ultra-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrum (UPLC-MS). This is the first report for the in vivo detection of IAA in plants using SS-based electrochemical microsensor. Our sensor provides an excellent sensing platform for detecting IAA in plants in vivo.

AB The research progress in the centrifugal microfluidic platform provides great opportunities for simple and effective analytical measurements in a variety of areas including biomedical engineering. In this study, we propose an optical reader that can measure the transmittance in a very sensitive and rapid manner on a hybrid paper-polymer centrifugal disc platform. This device enables real-time monitoring of multiple samples by measuring the absorbance of the light transmitted through the paper integrated on the disc between the light emitting diode (LED) and the photodiode (PD) regardless of the ambient light condition. To confirm its efficiency, we analyzed one of the blood's important indicators, glucose in a successful manner within 10 s without any additional complex image analysis. In addition, we discussed the results by comparing with the reflectance-based methods and with those of the previously reported studies by introducing a figure of merit to evaluate the performance of the assay.

AB Herein, we present that insect odorant receptors reconstituted into the lipid bilayers of liposomes can be successfully immobilized onto a gold surface and selectively and sensitively detect odorant molecules. The odorant receptors (OrXs) Or10a, Or22a, and Or71a from the common fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, were recombinantly expressed, purified and integrated into nano-liposomes (100-200 nm). These liposomes were covalently attached to the self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) of a 6-mercaptohexanoic acid (MHA)-modified gold surface. X-ray Photo Electron Spectroscopy (XPS) and Quartz Crystal Microbalance with Dissipation (QCMD) measurements confirmed the successful modification of the gold surface and immobilization of liposomes. Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) revealed that the liposomes were covalently attached to the surface without any disruption of vesicles. The liposomes tethered to the gold sensor surface were then treated with a range of known ligands of various concentrations. We demonstrated by Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) that an OrX/liposome EIS sensor can sensitively and selectively detect its known ligand to femtomolar concentrations by detecting a change in electrical signal upon binding. Our study is the first step towards using purified insect odorant receptors alone in biosensors to enable the development of novel ultrasensitive volatile sensors for medical diagnostic, air quality, food safety and border security applications.

AB Herein, we present the research focused on the synthesis and application of aptamer-modified gold nanoshells for photothermal therapy (PTT). NIR-absorbing hollow gold nanoshells were synthetized and conjugated with anti-MUC1 aptamer (HGNs@anti - MUC1). MUC1 (Mucin 1) is a transmembrane glycoprotein, which is over expressed in a variety of epithelial cancers (eg. breast, lung, pancreatic). In order to evaluate the efficiency of PTT with HGNs@anti - MUC1 we used 3D cell culture model - multicellular spheroids. The selected cell culture model is considered as the best in vitro model for cancer research (similar morphology, metabolite and oxygen gradients, cellular interactions and cell growth kinetics in the spheroids are similar to the early stage of a nonvascular tumor). We conducted our research on human normal (MRC-5, MCF-10A) and tumor (A549, MCF-7) cell lines using a microfluidic system. Aptamer-modified nanoparticles were accumulated selectively in tumor cells (A549, MCF-7) and this fact contributed to the reduction of tumor spheroids viability and size. It should be underlined, that it is the first example of photothermal therapy carried out in a microsystem on multicellular spheroids.

AB In this work, 3,4,9,10-perylenetetracar-boxylic acid (PTCA) as luminophor was grafted on the surface of graphene oxide (PTCA-GO) directly. GO exhibited large specific surface area and excellent electrical conductivity which can immobilize large amounts of PTCA to improve the electrochemiluminescence (ECL) efficiency. Moreover, gold nanoparticles (Au NPs) were anchored on the surface of PTCA-GO to immobilize primary antibodies (Ab(1)) via Au-NH2 bond and enhance the electron transport of PTCA-GO. CuS was used as a novel co-reaction accelerator in PTCA-K2S2O8 system to label secondary antibodies (Ab(2)), which can react with the coreactant (K2S2O8) to produce more SO4 center dot-, SiO2 nanospheres with large specific surface area were used to load a mass of CuS and Au NPs, which can directly combine with Ab(2) and accelerate the ECL emission remarkably. Therefore, a novel sandwich-type ECL immunosensor was fabricated successfully for amyloid-beta protein (A beta) detection. Under the optimal condition, a wide detection range from 50 fg/mL to 25 ng/mL and a low detection limit of 18 fg/mL (S/N = 3) were obtained. Featuring favorable specificity, stability and reproducibility, the strategy can be a powerful analytical tool in sensitive trace detection of biomolecules in clinical analysis.

The biosensing approach implied the use of ITO electrode coated with poly (phosphazene) polymer including benzaldehyde groups attached with CDH22 antibody and CDH22 antigens. Benzaldehyde side groups containing poly(phosphazene) film coated disposable ITO electrode were utilized as an immunosensing platform and anti-CDH22 antibodies bound to aldehyde groups of benzaldehyde substituted poly(phosphazene) (P-PHP) covalently. The immunosensor modification steps and affinity interaction between anti-CDH22 antibodies and CDH22 antigens were observed by EIS and CV in the presence of the redox couple. Furthermore, antibody immobilization was followed via FTIR and Raman spectroscopy. The morphological analyses of the suggested immunosensor during the fabrication steps were carried out with SEM and AFM monitoring. All the experimental parameters affecting the construction of the immunoelectrodes were optimized. The fabricated immunosensor exhibited an excellent working performance with a wide detection linear range (0.015-2.9 pg/mL) and low limit of detection (4.4 fg/mL). Moreover, the proposed immunosensor had great reproducibility, repeatability and long-term stability. Additionally, the fabricated immunosensor was successfully used in the quantification of CDH22 in human serum without any pretreatment.

AB Low-field, mobile NMR systems are increasingly used across diverse fields, including medical diagnostics, food quality control, and forensics. The throughput and functionality of these systems, however, are limited due to their conventional single-channel detection: one NMR probe exclusively uses an NMR console at any given time. Under this design, multi-channel detection could only be accomplished by either serially accessing individual probes or stacking up multiple copies of NMR electronics; this approach still retains limitations such as long assay times and increased system complexity. Here we present a new scalable architecture, HERMES (hetero-nuclear resonance multichannel electronic system), for versatile, high-throughput NMR analyses. HERMES exploits the concept of software-defined radio by virtualizing NMR electronics in the digital domain. This strategy i) creates multiple NMR consoles without adding extra hardware; ii) acquires signals from multiple NMR channels in parallel; and iii) operates in wide frequency ranges. All of these functions could be realized on demand in a single compact device. We interfaced HERMES with an array of NMR probes; the combined system simultaneously measured NMR relaxation from multiple samples and resolved spectra of hetero-nuclear spins (H-1, F-19, C-13). For potential diagnostic uses, we applied the system to detect dengue fever and molecularly profile cancer cells through multi-channel protein assays. HERMES holds promise as a powerful analytical tool that enables rapid, reconfigurable, and parallel detection.

AB Herein, an effective membrane-to-intracellular cholesterol detection strategy was designed based on cascade reactions. A biochip array was firstly fabricated by consecutively immobilizing luminol modified gold nanoparticles (Au@luminol), soybean peroxidase (SBP) and cholesterol oxidase (ChoX) on the cellulose acetate (CA) membrane functionalized home-made micropore array. When cholesterol existed, it was oxidized by ChoX generating H2O2, which further triggered the CL reaction under the SBP catalysis, the CL signals were collected by a charge-coupled device (CCD). The proposed strategy exhibited a wide linear range from 0.12 mu M to 1000 mu M and relatively low detection limit (LOD) of 0.08 mu M. Furthermore, it could be used to in-situ detect membrane cholesterol and intracelluar esterified cholesterol in HepG2 cells. After activated HepG2 cells were added to the modified biochip, membrane cholesterol was detected directly. Intracelluar esterified cholesterol was detected through the introduction of triton X-100 and cholesteryl esterase (ChoE). Additionally, the cholesterol content in cells was changed after stimulated by drugs, such as apolipoprotein A-I (ApoA-I), pitavastatin or probucol. The correlation of the CL signal with the amount of cholesterol confirmed that our strategy was feasible to simultaneously detect membrane and intracellular cholesterol at different cellular states. The proposed strategy exhibited excellent sensitivity, selectivity, stability, and reproducibility in a simple, cheap way, which opened a new door for studying clinic treatment of the cholesterol-related diseases.

AB Phospholipase A(2) (PLA(2)) enzyme could be acted as a unique biomarker for forecasting and diagnosing certain diseases. Therefore, it is important to monitor PLA(2) activity in biological and clinical samples. In this work, a simple electrochemical assay for PLA(2) activity was developed based on a screen-printed carbon electrode (SPCE) with 3D graphene-like surface. When the PLA(2)-containing sample was mixed with the nanoprobes, i.e. the electroactive marker methylene blue (MB) encapsulated within nanometer-sized phospholipid liposomes, MB was released and adsorbed/enriched in site onto the surface of SPCE in a micro-cell. The encapsulation and enzymatic release of MB were evaluated using UV-Vis and fluorescence. The peak current due to oxidation of the adsorbed MB on the SPCE was measured by square-wave voltammetry (SWV). The current was directly linear to the PLA(2) activity from 5 U/L to 200 U/L with a detection limit of 3 U/L. The same method can also be used for screening PLA(2) inhibitors. Thus, the enrichment strategy developed in this work could be a promising signal amplification method for the sensitive and selective detection of PLA(2) in biological or clinical samples.

AB A electrochemical biosensing strategy was developed for green and ultrasensitive detection of tumor cells by combining aptamer-DNA concatamer-CdTe quantum dots (QDs) signal amplification probe with mercury-free anodic stripping voltammetry (ASV). First, aptamer-DNA concatamer-CdTe QDs probes were designed by DNA hybridization and covalent assembling, which contained specific recognition of aptamer and signal amplification incorporating the DNA concatamer with QDs. Meanwhile, the capture electrode, glassy carbon electrode (GCE)/Graphene oxide (GO)/Polyaniline (PANI) / Glutaraldehyde (GA) / concanavalin A (Con A) was fabricated by a layer-by-layer assembling technique. K562 cells, as model cancer cells were detected to demonstrate the feasibility of this sensing strategy. Then, novel composite, graphene (GR)- Poly diallyldimethylammonium chloride (PDDA)L-Cysteine (L- Cys), was explored in ASV which replaced mercury electrodes using for determination of tumor cells. The proposed electrochemical biosensor showed high sensitivity with the detection limit of 60 cells mL(-1). More importantly, this novel design of signal amplification probes and the exploration of new composites in mercury-free ASV analysis would provide a promising method for ultrasensitive biosensor preparation and green electrochemical detection of tumor cells.

AB Abnormal DNA methylation is closely related to cancer initiation and progression, and strategies to assay methyltransferase activity and screen its inhibitors are essential for cancer diagnosis and therapy. In this work, surface plasmon resonance (SPR)-based assay for real-time and sensitive monitoring of DNA methyltransferase activity and screening of its inhibitors was conducted via methylation of double-stranded (ds)-DNA consensus sites and the follow-up p53 protein recognition. The consensus ds-DNA possesses a specific sequence of 5'-CCGG-3' in which the second C base can be methylated by M.SssI methyltransferase (M.SssI MTase) and the methylation process impedes the recognition and cleavage of the ds-DNA by HpaII endonuclease, thus, the attachment of p53 protein leads to remarkable SPR signals. In contrast, inhibition of M.SssI MTase activity by a potent inhibitor leaves the consensus ds-DNA unmethylated, and the cleavage of the ds-DNA by HpaII prevents p53 protein from adsorbing onto the chip surface, leading to tiny SPR signals. The binding affinity (K-D) between p53 protein and the methylated consensus ds-DNA was deduced to be 3.04 nM, evidencing the strong binding capability. Two nucleoside inhibitors of 5-Azacytidine (5-Aza) and 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-Aza-dC), and a non-nucleoside inhibitor of procaine were examined, and their half-maximal inhibiting concentration (IC50) values were highly comparable with those by other methods. The sensing protocol has been successfully utilized for the assay of M.SssI MTase activity in normal and cancer cell lysates. The proof-of-concept experiments demonstrate that SPR serves as a viable means for sensitive detection of methyltransferase activity and screening of its inhibitors using p53 protein bound to methylation-specific ds-DNA consensus sites.

AB In the last few years, there have been an increasing number of reports where different energy harvesters are directly combined with charge storing devices, based on dual-function electrodes able to convert and store electrical energy in the same volume. This includes (bio)fuel cells harvesting chemical energy, (bio)solar cells harvesting solar energy, tribo- and piezoelectric devices harvesting mechanical energy, and thermoelectrics harvesting thermal energy, which now have been intimately combined with batteries and electrochemical capacitors. These new types of hybrid electric devices show great promise especially for the design of self-powered electronics where an integrated hybrid power system is preferable to separated ones, capable of scavenging ambient energy and simultaneously store it and in this way increasing the efficiency and enabling further miniaturization. This paper details the recent emergence of hybrid energy systems, reviewing the progress made using widely different energy harvesting techniques, which have so-far not been described in a single body of work.

The microfluidic device consists of three microchannels, each one includes a region for focusing the Salmonella cells into the centerline of the microchannel and direct them toward the sensing region to obtain highly concentrated samples using positive dielectrophoresis force. A region for bacteria sensing consists of interdigitated electrode (IDE) array with 10 pairs of fingers. Three types of Salmonella antibodies (type B, D and E) were mixed separately with the cross-linker (Sulfo-LC-SPDP) to enhance the immobalization of the antibodies to the detection electrodes. The electrode surfaces was then functionalized with the three mixtures, one for each channel. As target antigen binds to the antibody, it results in impedance change. The Salmonella samples were spiked with Salmonella type B, introduced into the biosensor via the sample inlet into the focusing region, and then toward the sensing region where they bind to the immobilized antibody, causing a change in the impedance. The performance of the devices was tested using single Salmonella serotype B and two Salmonella serotypes B, and D, with a limit of detection of 7 cells/ml. The biosensor was also able to differentiate live from dead bacteria eliminating the false positive results. Finally, the device was also able to detect Salmonella selectively when other type of pathogen was present.

AB In this work, we developed benchtop and handheld Giant Magnetoresistive (GMR) biosensing systems that serve as platforms for detecting a wide variety of protein biomarkers for human diseases. System development included spintronic and nanomagnetic materials, biomolecular chemistry, electronic circuitry, analog and digital signal processing, firmware programming, user interface programming on both PC and Android smartphone, communications over both USB and Bluetooth, and mechanical integration. In this work, we demonstrated the benchtop GMR biosensing system in the context of ovarian cancer assay development. The prototype system delivered the required performance in terms of high-sensitivity multiplex assays in a portable format with enough flexibility to serve as a platform for ovarian cancer and many other diseases. We achieved multiplex detection of cancer antigen 125 (CA125 II), human epididymis protein 4 (HE4), and interleukin 6 (IL6), with limits of detection (LOD) as low as 3.7 U/mL, 7.4 pg/mL, and 7.4 pg/mL, respectively.

AB Two different type of electrodes, boron-doped diamond electrode (BDD) and boron-doped carbon nanowalls (B:CNW) electrode, were used for the electrochemical determination of paracetamol using the cyclic voltammetry and the differential pulse voltammetry in phosphate buffered saline, pH = 7.0. The main advantage of these electrodes is their utilization without any additional modification of the electrode surface. The peak current was linearly related to the concentration of paracetamol in the range from 0.065 mu M to 32 mu M for BDD electrode and from 0.032 mu M to 32 mu M for B:CNW electrode. The limit of detection was 0.430 mu M and 0.281 mu M for BDD and B:CNW electrode, respectively. Additionally, we studied the effect of pH on the redox reaction of paracetamol at the both electrodes in Britton-Robinson buffer solution in the range of pH 3.0-12.0, indicating the pH 7.0 value as the most suitable for the current experiments. The studies also included the various scan rates in range of 50-500 mV/s. Finally, our team selected the B:CNW electrode for the determination of paracetamol in the artificial urine sample using differential pulse voltammetry method, obtaining the calculated limit of detection on the level of 0.08006 mu M.

AB One-dimensional photonic crystal slabs are periodic optical nanostructures that produce guided-mode resonance. They couple part of the incident light into the waveguide generating bandgaps in the transmittance spectrum, whose position is sensitive to refractive index variations on their surface. In this study, we present one-dimensional photonic crystal slab biosensors based on the internal nanogrooved structure of Blu-ray disks for label-free immunosensing. We demonstrated that this polycarbonate structure coated with a critical thickness of TiO2 generates guided-mode resonance. Its optical behavior was established comparing it with other compact disk structures. The results were theoretically calculated and experimentally demonstrated, all them being in agreement. The bioanalytical performance of these photonic crystals was experimentally demonstrated in a model assay to quantify IgGs as well as in two immunoassays to determine the biomarkers C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase (detection limits of 0.1, 87, and 13 nM, respectively). The results are promising towards the development of new low-cost, portable, and label-free optical biosensors that join these photonic crystals with dedicated bioanalytical scanners based on compact disk drives.

AB We propose a plasmonic enhanced lateral flow sensor (pLFS) concept with an enhanced colorimetric signal by utilizing liposome encapsulating reagent to trigger the aggregation of gold nanoparticles (GNPs). Our signal enhancement strategy incorporates the simplicity of lateral flow immunoassays (LFIA) utilizing plasmonic enhancement. The conceptualized hybrid pLFS for onsite rapid detection of pathogens in low numbers in a user friendly format requiring simple steps is the first step in the translation of plasmonic enhancement sensing to a practical regime. The pLFS was carried out with a biotinylated liposome label ruptured to release branched polyethylenimine (BPEI) to trigger the aggregation of GNPs for colorimetric signal generation. BPEI has multiple amino groups and more positive charges in PBS buffer, therefore few of the BPEI groups could induce the aggregation of GNPs, resulting in an enhanced colorimetric signal to detect E. coli O157:H7. Compared with the reported conventional LFIA, the proposed pLFS demonstrated more than 1000-fold improvement in sensitivity. The pLFS could detect as low as 100 CFU/ml of E. coli O157:H7 in buffer and 600 CFU/ml E. coli O157:H7 in liquid food systems.

AB A novel red light-driven photoelectrochemical (PEC) biosensing platform based on hypotoxic ternary mercaptopropionic acid (MPA)-capped AgInS2 nanoparticles (NPs) with excellent hydrophily and biocompatibility was proposed. AgInS2 NPs as a PEC sensing substrate exhibited high photon-to-current conversion efficiency under red light excitation, generating an intensive photocurrent for enhancing the sensitivity of PEC determination. After the introduction of the amino-terminated sgc8c aptamer onto the interface of AgInS2 NPs, the over-expressed protein tyrosine kinase-7 on the surface of lymphoblast CCRF-CEM cells could be efficiently captured. Using CCRF-CEM cell as a model analyte, an ultrasensitive PEC biosensor for scatheless assay of cells at the applied potential of 0.15 V under a red light excitation of 630 nm was designed based on the significant decline of photocurrent intensity after capturing CCRF-CEM cells. The developed PEC cytosensor demonstrated an excellent cell-capture ability, as well as a wide linear range from 1.5 x 10(2) to 3.0 x 10(5) cells/mL and a low detection limit of 16 cells/mL for CCRF-CEM cells. In addition, the resulting assay method verified high selectivity and negligible cytotoxicity for cells assay. This work provided an alternative method for scatheless assay of tumor cells, which would have promising prospect in clinical diagnoses of cancer.

AB Inspired by the pop-up greeting cards, a 3D collapsible auto-cleaning paper-based electrochemiluminescence (ECL) biosensor (CAPEB) with different functions of signal collection and residual multiple cleaning, is developed for sensitive detection of Ni2+ and Hg2+ by simply regulating its 3D configurations. The multiple fluidic paths and the hollow-channel structure were firstly integrated into the paper substrate, realizing simultaneously repetitive auto-cleaning of the two working electrodes. For achieving ultrasensitive Ni2+ and Hg2+ monitoring, binary catalysis consisting of the intermolecular co-reaction (H2O2 and N-(4-Aminobutyl)-N-ethylisoluminol (ABEI)) and intramolecular catalysis (polyethyleneimine (PEI)-ABEI) was introduced. Specifically, silver nano-spheres with a large specific surface area and excellent conductivity were grown on the paper working electrode and served as the sensor substrate for fixing PEI-ABEI and Ni2+-specific DNAzyme. With the assistance of DNAzyme, Cu2O-Au and ferrocene (Fc) labeled strand S2 were immobilized on electrode surface through the hybridization reaction, and catalyzed H2O2 to generate reactive oxygen species, promoting the luminescence of ABEI. In the existence of Ni2+, DNAzyme was activated followed by cleavage of strand S2 to induce the release of Fc, which quenched the ECL signal of ABEI, eventually realizing the detection of Ni2+. Similarly, for sensitive quantification of Hg2+, full thymine (T) bases strand S3 was modified on surface of Cu2O-Au and anchored Hg2+ by T-Hg2+-T pairing interaction. The ECL intensity was decreased along with increasing of Hg2+ due to the quenching effect of Hg2+ on ECL emission of ABEI. Based on this ingenious system, the detection of Ni2+ and Hg2+ had high sensitivity, wide linear ranges, and low detection limits. The results indicated that the integration of a multi-channel structure into a paper device chips opened new opportunities for designing promising paper-based devices for metal ions diagnosis.

AB Herein, we propose the first three-dimensional origami paper-based device for the detection of several classes of pesticides by combining different enzyme-inhibition biosensors. This device was developed by integrating two different office paper-based screen-printed electrodes and multiple filter paper-based pads to load enzymes and enzymatic substrates. The versatile analysis of different pesticides was carried by folding and unfolding the filter paper-based structure, without any addition of reagents and any sample treatment (i.e. dilution, filtration, pH adjustment). The paper-based platform was employed to detect paraoxon, 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid, and atrazine by exploiting the capability of these different types of pesticides (i.e. organophosphorus insecticides, phenoxy-acid herbicides, and triazine herbicide) to inhibit butyrylcholinesterase, alkaline phosphatase, and tyrosinase, respectively. The degree of inhibition correlating to the quantity of pesticides was evaluated by chronoamperometrically monitoring the enzymatic activity in the absence and in the presence of pesticides by using a portable potentiostat. To improve the sensitivity, the paper-based electrodes were modified with carbon black alone in the case of platforms for 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid and atrazine detection, or decorated with Prussian blue nanoparticles for the detection of paraoxon. The paper-based device was applied for the detection of paraoxon, 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid, and atrazine at ppb level in both standard solutions and river water sample. The accuracy of this origami multiple paper-based electrochemical biosensor was evaluated in river water by recovery studies, obtaining satisfactory values (e.g. for paraoxon 90 +/- 1% and 88 +/- 2%, for 10 and 20 ppb, respectively). The proposed three-dimensional origami paper device allows for rapid, cost-effective and accurate pesticide detection in surface water as a result of combining filter and office papers, screen-printing, wax-printing and nanomaterial technology.

AB Large-scale neural recordings with high spatial and temporal accuracy are instrumental to understand how the brain works. To this end, it is of key importance to develop probes that can be conveniently scaled up to a high number of recording channels. Despite recent achievements in complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) multi-electrode arrays probes, in current circuit architectures an increase in the number of simultaneously recording channels would significantly increase the total chip area. A promising approach for overcoming this scaling issue consists in the use of the modular Active Pixel Sensor (APS) concept, in which a small front-end circuit is located beneath each electrode. However, this approach imposes challenging constraints on the area of the in-pixel circuit, power consumption and noise. Here, we present an APS CMOS-probe technology for Simultaneous Neural recording that successfully addresses all these issues for whole-array read-outs at 25 kHz/channel from up to 1024 electrode-pixels. To assess the circuit performances, we realized in a 0.18 mu m CMOS technology an implantable single-shaft probe with a regular array of 512 electrode-pixels with a pitch of 28 mu m. Extensive bench tests showed an in-pixel gain of 45.4 +/- 0.4 dB (low pass, F-3 db = 4 kHz), an input referred noise of 73 +/- 0.67 mu V-RMS (300 Hz to 7.5 kHz) and a power consumption < 6 mu W/pixel. In vivo acute recordings demonstrate that our SiNAPS CMOS-probe can sample full-band bioelectrical signals from each electrode, with the ability to resolve and discriminate activity from several packed neurons both at the spatial and temporal scale. These results pave the way to new generations of compact and scalable active single/multi-shaft brain recording systems.

AB Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) biosensors have become an important label-free optical biomolecular sensing technology and a "gold standard" for retrieving information on the kinetics of biomolecular interactions. Even though biomolecules typically contain an abundance of easily ionizable chemical groups, there is a gap in understanding of whether (and how) the electrostatic charge of a biomolecular system influences the SPR biosensor response. In this work we show that negative static charge present in a biomolecular layer on the surface of an SPR sensor results in significant SPR spectral shifts, and we identify two major mechanisms responsible for such shifts: 1) the formation of an electrical double layer (ionic mechanism), and 2) changes in the electron density at the surface of a metal (electronic mechanism). We show that under low ionic strength conditions, the electronic mechanism is dominant and the SPR wavelength shift is linearly proportional to the surface concentration of biomolecular charges. At high ionic strength conditions, both electric and ionic mechanisms contribute to the SPR wavelength shift. Using the electronic mechanism, we estimated the pKa of surface-bound carboxylic groups and the relative concentration of the carboxyl-terminated alkanethiols in a binary self-assembled monolayer of alkanethiols. The reported sensitivity of SPR to surface charge is especially important in the context of biomolecular sensing. Moreover, it provides an avenue for the application of SPR sensors for fast, label-free determination of the net charge of a biomolecular coating, which is of interest in material science, surface chemistry, electrochemistry, and other fields.

ID DIAGNOSIS
AB Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is the leading cause of mortality in children under five years of age, globally. Given that Streptococcus pneumoniae (S. pneumoniae) and Mycoplasma pneumoniae (M. pneumoniae) are the most common pathogens associated with CAP requiring hospital admission, a simple, low cost, highly sensitive method is in great need for immediate and early diagnosis of CAP. Herein, we report a versatile microfluidic chip platform integrated with loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) for simultaneous S. pneumoniae and M. pneumoniae testing at the point of care. The platform includes a polymer/paper microfluidic chip and a portable device. On-chip magnetic particle-based nucleic acid extraction is used for concentration of pathogens' genomic DNA and is followed by LAMP. The portable device has the function of heating the microfluidic chip, and photographing and transmitting the result to a smartphone. Complete extraction of the DNA using the microfluidic chip took similar to 15 min versus > 1.5 h with a phenol-chloroform method. The analytical sensitivity of the assay was determined to be 20 fg by testing serial dilutions of target DNA ranging from 2 ng to 2 fg per reaction. We evaluated the clinical sensitivity and specificity of the IP mu chip assay using 63 randomly selected oropharyngeal swabs and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid specimens from children. For comparison, these specimens were also tested against real-time PCR assay (M. pneumoniae), conventional PCR assay (S. pneumoniae), and culture tests (S. pneumoniae). These results yielded positive and negative predictive values for M. pneumoniae testing with the IP mu chip platform of 96.9% and 100%, respectively. Compared with S. pneumoniae IP chip, the clinical sensitivity of S. pneumoniae PCR and culture tests was 60% and 40%, respectively, while clinical specificity of the two tests was 100%. This versatile IP mu chip platform has great potential for point of care testing of different kinds of pathogens, especially for developing nations.

AB This research demonstrated the electrochemical modification of low-cost titanium (Ti) metal substrate with gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) for the aptamer-based detection of cardiac troponin I (cTnI). AuNPs were deposited onto Ti sheets by the potential-step deposition method with high density and homogeneity as well as good crystallinity. It was then applied as a transducer to immobilize a thiol-functionalized DNA aptamer via the self-assembled monolayer mechanism for the specific binding of cTnI. This was verified through electrochemical and morphological analyses. The aptasensor could detect cTnI in a linear range of 1-1100 pM with a detection limit of ca. 0.18 pM. The aptasensor showed high sensitivity and specificity to cTnI over other interfering compounds with good recoveries in the diluted human serum samples.

AB An integrated microfluidic device, consisting of a solid-phase extraction (SPE) unit for metal ion pretreatment, a micropump, a micromixer, and a detachable graphene oxide quantum dot (GOQD) array chip was constructed for selective and sensitive detection of As3+, Cd2+, and Pb2+. The entire process could be sequentially and automatically completed by actuating a pneumatic micropump. Effect of the pH for metal ion capture and pumping scheme for recovery efficiency were investigated on a chip. The ion As3+, Cd2+, and Pb2+ whose concentrations ranged from 10(-2) mu M to 10(2) mu M were successfully recovered with high efficiency over 80%. Monoplex and multiplex detection of As3+, Cd2+, and Pb2+ were then executed on a GOQD array chip. The target metal ions were specifically captured on the DNA aptamer linked GOQD array, which results in the fluorescence quenching of GOQD due to the electron transfer from the GOQD to metal ions under the laser irradiation. The proposed integrated SPE-GOQD array based microdevice could perform As3+, Cd2+, and Pb2+ detection with detection limits of 5.03 nM, 41.1 nM, and 4.44 nM, respectively. Simultaneous multiplex detection for binary or ternary mixture of As3+, Cd2+, and Pb2+ was performed, and the proposed integrated microdevice also showed high recovery values ranging from 83.52% to 128.3% from the environmental samples.

AB The quantification of proteins is essential in fundamental research or clinical applications. Here, we developed a facile electrochemical aptasensor based on target-induced turn-off of photosensitization for label-free and ultrasensitive detection of protein (exemplified by lysozyme). EB (ethidium bromide) molecules that were embedded in dsDNA between lysozyme binding aptamer and complementary DNA immobilized on the electrode, could photo-cleave the dsDNA via singlet oxygen (O-2(1)) during photosensitization, resulting in a high voltammetry current of the [Fe(CN)(6)](3-/4-). Upon recognition of the lysozyme by aptamer, the EB molecules were released from dsDNA, and its photosensitization activity was turned off. As a result, more amount of complementary DNA was retained on the Au nanoparticles modified carbon nanotube paste electrode (AuNPs-CNPE), leading to a declined voltammetry current. Such a sensing strategy allowed detection of 10 pM-1 mu M lysozyme with a low detection limit (about 2 pM). Besides, the sensor was free of labeling procedure as well as extra signal amplification step, and the CNPE modification was quite simple, only with AuNPs. The sensor also showed excellent selectivity toward lysozyme in the presence of interfering proteins, such as thrombin, bovine serum albumin, myoglobin, etc. The proposed sensor was applied to the determination of lysozyme in urine samples with the recoveries ranging from 96.6% to 101%. The proposed biosensor holds a great promise in developing other electrochemical sensors based on photosensitization.

AB The cardiac Troponin-I (cTnI) is one of the subunits of cardiac troponin complexes and a pivotal biochemical marker of acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Due to its myocardial specificity, cTnI is widely used for the diagnosis of AMI diseases. In this study, a novel imprinted biosensor approach based on boron nitride quantum dots (BNQDs) was presented for cTnI detection in plasma samples. Various characterization methods such as scanning electron microscope (SEM), transmission electron microscope (TEM), x-ray diffraction (XRD), cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) were used for all characterizations of nanomaterials. After the characterization analysis, cTnI imprinted electrode was developed in the presence of 100.0 mM pyrrole containing 25.0 mM cTnI. After that, the analytical studies of cTnI in plasma samples were performed by using cTnI imprinted biosensor. The results of the study have revealed that 0.01-5.00 ng mL(-1) and 0.0005 ng mL(-1) were found as the linearity range and the detection limit (LOD). Moreover, the selectivity of cTnI imprinted glassy carbon electrode (GCE) was investigated for plasma sample analysis in the presence of other nonspecific and specific proteins including cardiac myoglobin (MYG), bovine serum albumin (BSA) and cardiac troponin T (cTnT), respectively. Furthermore, the prepared biosensor was examined in terms of stability, repeatability, reproducibility and reusability. Finally, the imprinted biosensor was applied to the plasma samples having high recovery.

AB Norovirus (NoV) is a leading cause of acute gastroenteritis. The low infectious dose and environmental stability of NoV facilitate its effective transmission through a variety of modes such as food, water and person-to-person. The available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for NoV detection has low sensitivity due to the low catalytic activity of the peroxidase used, and thus, a reliable ultrasensitive bioassay is needed. In this study, we apply the enhanced peroxidase-like activity of silver ion-incorporated gold nanoparticles (Au/Ag NPs) in a colorimetric bioassay for NoV detection. NoV was captured by anti-NoV genogroup II antibodies, which were immobilized on the surface of a 96-well microtiter plate and formed a sandwich structure among anti-NoV Ab, NoV and Ab-Au NP. Then, Ag ion-containing hydroquinone was added to form Au/Ag core/shell NPs. When H2O2/3,3',5,5'-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) solution was added to the wells, Ag ions were liberated from the surface of Au/Ag NPs and enhanced the oxidation of TMB. These reactions enhanced the oxidation of TMB and developed an intense blue color. The Au/Ag NPs were shown to exhibit higher affinity and catalytic efficiency for H2O2 and higher catalytic velocity based on the k(cat), of up to 7-fold compared with Au NPs. The bioassay was then optimized to detect clinically isolated NoV using NoV-like particles (NoV-LPs). NoV-LPs were detected with a limit of detection of 10.8 pg/mL, corresponding to 1000- and 100-fold higher sensitivity compared to the gold-immunoassay and horseradish peroxidase-based ELISA, respectively. Clinically isolated NoV GII.4 and NoV GII.3 were detected in the range of 10(2)-10(6) copies of viral RNA/mL fecal solution with a detection limit of 13.2 copies/mL fecal solution for NoV GII.4, equivalent to 132 copies of viral RNA/g feces and indicating significantly higher sensitivity compared to commercial immunoassay kits., This bioassay represents a workable detection assay for low concentrations of NoV that is applicable for early-stage diagnosis for public hygiene.

AB Understanding the characteristics of microbial growth is of great significance to many fields including in scientific research, the food industry, health care, and agriculture. Many methods have been established to characterize the process of microbial growth. Online and automated methods, in which sample transfer is avoided, are popular because they can facilitate the development of simple, safe, and effective growth monitoring. This review focuses on advances in online monitoring methods over the last decade (2008-2018). We specifically focus on optic- and electrochemistry-based techniques, either through contact measurements or contactless measurement. Strengths and weaknesses of each set of methods are described and we also speculate on forthcoming trends in the field.

AB A sensitive dual mode competitive electrochemical immunosensor for the detection of B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) was successfully fabricated, which based on differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) and amperometric i-t curve response modes. Polyaniline (PAN) and tin dioxide (SnO2) were loaded on graphene sheets (GS), which could effectively promote the electron transfer process, thereby amplifying the current signal and increasing the sensitivity of the immunosensor. To promote biocompatibility, gold nanoparticles (Au) were incorporated on GS/SnO2/PAN (GS/SnO2/PAN-Au). GS/SnO2/PAN-Au complex was gotten to act as the platform which could provide a clearly DPV signals. N-doped carbon nanotubes (N-CNTs) embellished by ZnCo2O4 quantum dots (ZnCo2O4/N-CNTs) with excellent catalytic properties for the reduction of H2O2 was gotten to act as the label of the antibody-BNP (Ab), providing an obviously current signal through amperometric i-t curve method. A large quantity of BNP could be stable loaded in the modified electrode via GS/SnO2/PAN-Au with excellent electrical conductivity and good biocompatibility, which could compete with target-BNP to combine Ab that labelled by ZnCo2O4/N-CNTs. Under the optimum conditions, the immunosensor exhibited remarkable analytical performance of a linear range from 0.01 pg/mL to 1 ng/mL with a detection limit of 3.4 fg/mL for quantitative detection of BNP (S/N = 3). This method was able to become a universal strategy for other biological detection.

AB A label- and amplification-free photoelectric immunosensor based on well-defined layer-by-layer sandwich-structured AuNP/TNW/AuNP composite is proposed for direct and ultrasensitive detection of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP). The AuNP/TNW/AuNP composite is produced by assembling an Au nanoparticle underlayer and anatase TiO2 nanowires (TNW) onto the FTO substrate, followed by decorating Au nanoparticles onto the TNW surface, through a simple sputtering and hydrothermal process. The resulting AuNP/TNW/AuNP electrode exhibits a 14-fold and 2-fold enhancement in photocurrent density under simulated sunlight compared with that of bare TNW and AuNP/TNW, respectively, which benefits from the SPR-induced photoabsorption increment and charge separation improvement in Au nanoparticle and interfacial charge transfer promotion at the TiO2/substrate interface in the Au underlayer. As a proof of concept, the AFP antigen can be quantitatively detected by the proposed AuNP/TNW/AuNP coupled with anti-AFP through the analysis of the photocurrent change. This novel AFP photoelectric immunosensor exhibited sensitive detection of AFP with an ultrahigh sensitivity of 0.001 ng mL(-1) and good specific selectivity. Moreover, the practical determination of AFP in human serum is also investigated, demonstrating its applicability and potential attraction for clinical tests and disease diagnosis.

AB Constructing junctions between semiconductors is an effective way to promote charge separation and thus to improve the photoelectrochemical (PEC) performances, and specifically, p-n heterojunction is considered as a very promising structure. Herein, we designed and fabricated MoS2/nitrogen doped graphene hydrogels (MoS2/NGH) p-n heterojunction by a facile one-pot hydrothermal route. The as-fabricaterd MoS2/NGH heterostructures demonstrated the excellent PEC activity, exhibiting enhanced photocurrent intensity by the fast transfer and separation rate of photogenerated electron-hole owing to the construction of p-n heterojunction. Based on the high PEC performances of the MoS2/NGH heterostructure, a novel sensitive PEC sensor was developed for the determination of chloramphenicol (CAP) with the assistance of aptamer. In the presence of target molecules, the as-fabricated PEC sensor could recognize the CAP quickly and then consume the holes in the interface of heterostructures, inhibiting the recombination of photogenerated electron-hole pairs, resulting the enhanced photocurrent. Specially, with the concentration of CAP increased, the photocurrent enhanced gradually. Excellent linearity was obtained in the concentration range from 32.3 ng/L to 96.9 mu g/L, and the limit of detection was 3.23 ng/L. Moreover, the as-fabricated PEC sensor exhibited rapid response, high stability, low-cost and high selectivity, which could be successfully applied to the analysis of CAP in honeycomb samples.

AB Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) biosensors have enormous potential in biological recognitions and biomolecular interactions, especially for the real time measurement of disease diagnosis and drug screening. Extensive efforts have been invested to ameliorate the sensing performances, while the photothermal effects, which are induced by the plasmon resonance, have an obvious impact. However, due to the limitations of experimental approaches, the theoretical mechanisms and specific influences of the SPR sensors with photothermal effects are few researched. Here, a multiscale simulation method is developed to investigate the photothermal effects at graphene/gold (Au) nanointerfaces, and to calculate the quantitative contribution of the photothermal effects towards high reliability SPR sensors in order to elucidate their influence on the sensing performances by means of first-principle calculations and molecular dynamics simulations. Our results indicate that the sensitivity and detection accuracy of graphene/Au SPR sensors can be tailored from 0 K to 600 K, due to the tunable dielectric constants of Au and graphene films through temperature variation. By controlling the its material thickness, interfacial combination and lattice strain, an optimized graphene/Au SPR sensor with higher sensitivity, detection accuracy, and reliability to the temperature rising has been achieved. Such multiscale simulation method, which is capable of seeking both the role and the underlying mechanism of the interfacial phenomena, can serve as an excellent guideline for the performance optimization and commercialized application of SPR sensors in the analytical chemistry and biomedical fields.

AB The in-situ and rapid detection of live and dead bacteria is essential for human and environmental care. It has become one of the biggest needs in the biological and medical sciences to prevent infectious diseases, which usually occur in hospitals and field clinics. In the current scenario, antibiotic resistance is one of the severe public health problems, which requires a quick and efficient solution. Here, we report a facile sensitive, portable, user-friendly, cost-effective and time saving approach for detection of live, dead and drug-resistant bacteria. The endogenous H2S evolution was targeted to differentiate between live and dead as well as antibiotic resistant bacteria. The silver nanorods (AgNRs) arrays sensors were fabricated by glancing angle deposition technique. The colorimetric and water wettability features of as-synthesized AgNRs are found to be highly sensitive and selective for H2S. E. coli. P. aeruginosa, B. subtilis and S. aureus were used as a model organism in this study. All the bacteria were found to produce H2S by their metabolism process. In order to detect the antibiotic resistant E. coli were grown in the presence of different concentration of ampicillin in Luria broth. A drastic visible change in color as well as wetting of AgNRs array was observed. To make the technique easy, a user-friendly and field deployable mobile app 'Colorimetric Detector' was developed. This technique takes only 4-6 h whereas the conventional methods need around 24 h for the same. This dual mode facile and, inexpensive method can be easily scaled up in the field of diagnostics.

AB A kind of novel biosensor based on the electromagnetic induced transparency like (EIT-like) metamaterials (MMs) have been proposed. It demonstrates that the symmetry-breaking double-splits ring resonators can realize the EIT-like plasmonic resonance, the according transparency window occurs at 1.67 THz. The coupled oscillators model illustrates that with the increase of asymmetry degree of double splits, the coupling between bright and dark mode is enhanced. Consequently, the non-radiative damping gamma(2) grows from 1.45 to 1.85 THz and coupling coefficient kappa from 3.46 to 4.49 THz(2), while the radiative damping gamma(1) decreases from 11.5 to 9 THz. Such EIT-like MMs were evaluated in simulation as the refractive index sensors, which the theoretical sensitivity was calculated to 455.7 GHz/RIU (RIU, Refractive Index Unit) under 11 mu m-thick analyte layer. Meanwhile, the dependence of full width at half maximum (FWHM) on analyte thickness was also studied. In experiments, it is found that the frequency shift Delta f increases from 50 to 90 GHz when the oral cancer cells (HSC3) concentration improves from 1 x 10(5) to 7 x 10(5) cells/ml. The maximum experimental sensitivity approaches 900 kHz/cell ml(-1) at 7 x 10(5) cells/ml. Additionally, the apoptosis of cancer cells under the effect of anti-cancer drug was investigated. It shows that with the increase of anti-cancer drug concentration from 1 to 15 mu M and the extension of drug action duration from 24 to 72 h, the Delta f changes from 140 to 70 GHz and 140-40 GHz, respectively. Besides, the corresponding FWHM also increases from 237.9 to 305.4 GHz and 237.8-337.6 GHz. The results measured by MMs biosensors and biological method exhibit a relatively good agreement, showing a great potential for cells measurement with the sensitive biosensors based on the EIT-like MMs.

AB We report here cadmium sulfide quantum dots (CdS QDs)-encapsulated metal-organic frameworks as signal-amplifying tags for ultrasensitive electrochemical detection of Escherichia coli O157:H7 (E. coli O157:H7). CdS QDs were encapsulated in zeolitic imidazolate framework-8 (ZIF-8) to form CdS@ZIF-8 muti-core-shell particles by in situ growth of ZIF-8 in the presence of CdS QDs. To specifically recognize E. coli O157:H7 cells, CdS@ZIF-8 particles were coated with polyethyleneimine to introduce amino groups on their surfaces, followed by surface modification of anti-E. coli O157:H7 antibody. A sandwich-type electrochemical immunobiosensor for the detection of E. coli O157:H7 was fabricated using CdS@ZIF-8 particles as signal tags. Cd(II) ions were released from CdS@ZIF-8 tags by HCl leaching, enabling the detection of E. coli O157:H7 by differential pulse voltammetry. Under the optimized conditions, the linear range of the biosensor is from 10 to 10(8) colony forming units (CFU) per mL for E. coli O157:H7 detection, with the detection limit of 3 CFU mL(-1) (S/N = 3). The sensitivity of the biosensor for E. coli O157:H7 detection using CdS@ZIF-8 particles as signal tags is 16 times that of a biosensor using CdS QDs as signal tags, because the number of CdS QDs labeled to each bacterial cell increases greatly resulting from a great number of CdS QDs encapsulated in each CdS@ZIF-8 label. This method was successfully used to detect E. coli O157:H7 in milk samples.

An alternative method simplifying the antibodies immobilization process by functionalization of 2D nanomaterial (MoS2 nanosheets) for rapid (similar to 15 mins) bacterial quantification is presented in this study. The immunosensor uses wavelength interrogation method and a strong linear relationship (R-2 = 0.994) was observed between spectral response of immunosensor and different concentration of E. coli. The nonspecificity and cross-reactivity studies of the developed immunosensor were investigated with detection of Salmonella Typhimurium and Staphylococcus aureus. To demonstrate the practical application, spiked samples of water and orange juice were analysed with acceptable recovery results. The label-free immunosensor exhibits better performance, detection limit (94 CFU/mL), high sensitivity (2.9 nm/1000 CFU mL(-1); 3135 nm/RIU) and profound specificity as compared to conventional fiber optic SPR sensor (detection limit: 391 CFU/mL, sensitivity: 0.6 nm/1000 CFU mL(-1); 1646 nm/RIU). This sensing platform shows promising applications in regular water and food quality monitoring for various pathogenic microorganisms.

AB The reusability of capacitive field-effect electrolyte-insulator-semiconductor (EIS) sensors modified with a cationic weak polyelectrolyte (poly(allylamine hydrochloride) (PAH)) for the label-free electrical detection of single-stranded DNA (ssDNA), in-solution- and on-chip-hybridized double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) has been studied. It has been demonstrated that via simply regeneration of the gate surface of the EIS sensor by means of an electrostatic adsorption of a new PAH layer, the same biosensor can be reused for at least five DNA-detection measurements. Because of the reversal of the charge sign of the outermost layer after each surface modification with the cationic PAH or negatively charged DNA molecules, the EIS-biosensor signal exhibits a zigzag-like behavior. The amplitude of the signal changes has a tendency to decrease with increasing number of macro molecular layers. The direction of the EIS-signal shifts can serve as an indicator for a successful DNA-immobilization or -hybridization process. In addition, we observed that the EIS-signal changes induced by each surface-modification step (PAH adsorption, immobilization of ssDNA or dsDNA molecules and on-chip hybridization of complementary target cDNA) is decreased with increasing the ionic strength of the measurement solution, due to the more efficient macromolecular charge-screening by counter ions. The results of field-effect experiments were supported by fluorescence-intensity measurements of the PAH- or DNA-modified EIS surface using various fluorescence dyes.

AB In this work, the gram-negative bacterium Escherichia colt strain BL21(DE3) (with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in its outer membrane) and its modified ClearColi (TM). strain (lacking LPS) were used for the separation of anti-LPS antibodies from human serum by the following steps: (1) binding of the serum proteins to BL21(DE3); (2) dissociation of the bound proteins (including anti-LPS antibodies) from BL21(DE3) with acid; (3) filtering of the dissociated proteins using ClearColi to remove unwanted proteins; and (4) separation of the antibody fraction by protein-A column chromatography. The binding properties of the separated antibodies were analyzed by fluorescence-activated cell sorting to confirm their selective binding to LPS on the outer membrane of BL21(DE3), and by thermophoretic immunoassay to estimate their dissociation constant. The in vitro applicability of the separated anti-LPS antibodies was demonstrated through a fluorescence assay of BL21(DE3), after immobilizing the antibodies onto a modified microplate surface. The electrochemical detection of BL21(DE3) was also achieved after immobilizing the anti-LPS antibodies onto a gold electrode.

AB A signal amplification electrochemical aptasensor for ultrasensitive detection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was fabricated. The sensor was constructed with a probe of LPS aptamer and a copper ions-mediated gold nano particles aggregate (Cu/Au NA) as a signal amplification material. The Cu/Au NAs comprising copper ions (Cu2+) and L-cysteine modified AuNPs were fabricated by a self-assembly process. For functionalization of the electrode, the carboxylic group of a mercaptoacetic acid self-assembly layer was covalently coupled with the amine group of the aptamer. The aptamer with high specificity and affinity can effectively gather the dissociative LPS firstly, and the Cu/Au NAs were captured by anionic groups of the carbohydrate portions from LPS molecules based on the specific interactions. With the employment of the sandwich-type biosensor, the strategy can significantly amplify the electrochemical signal for determination of trace amount of LPS. The sensing performance of the electrochemical sensor was investigated by differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) and the stripping peak currents of Cu re-oxidized to Cu2+ was used to monitor the level of LPS. The electrochemical aptasensor exhibited excellent sensitivity toward LPS with a detection limit of 0.033 pg/mL (S/N = 3). The biosensor also exhibited a high specificity toward LPS in the presence of other common interfering substances and was easily regenerated. Furthermore, the fabricated biosensor showed a good practical application for LPS determination in human serum samples.

Afterward, a convenient label-free signal-on ECL approach was constructed for CoA detection with excellent specificity. In addition, the unique ECL enhancing phenomenon was also proposed to assay the enzymatic activity of histone acetyltransferases (HAT) and screen relevant inhibitors, exhibiting a promising potential in the practical application of biochemical research, disease diagnosis and drug discovery.

AB In this study, we established an ultrasensitive electrochemical immunosensor based on the gold nanoparticles-enhanced tyramide signal amplification (AuNPs-TSA) for the detection of procalcitonin (PCT, for discriminating bacterial infections from nonbacterial infections). Firstly, a facilely prepared, well-conducting reduced graphene oxide nanosheets/GNP (rGO-AuNPs) nanocomposite was synthesized and immobilized on the electrode surface to absorb more capture antibodies (Ab1). Next another nanocomposite, acting as a signal tool, was modified with detection antibody (Ab2) and horseradish peroxidase (HRP), and then backfilled by bovine serum albumin (BSA). Because a single AuNP is able to load multiple HRPs and BSAs, a number of tyramine labeled biotins (T-B) could be deposited on the proteins adhering to the surface of AuNPs. Moreover, the high affinity between streptavidin (SA) and biotins significantly increases the loading of streptavidin labeled horseradish peroxidase (SA-HRP). The amplification system which was based on the two nanocomposites mentioned above, effectively amplified the electric current signals. This immunosensor exhibits a wide dynamic detection range from 0.05 ng mL(-1) to 100 ng mL(-1) and with an ultralow detection limit of 0.1 pg mL(-1). We have successfully utilized this immunosensor to quantify the concentration of PCT in human serum samples, and the results suggest its potential use in clinical application.

AB To explore genome mutation meaningfully, it is in urgent need to develop an automated and inexpensive platform for DNA mutation analysis. Digital microfluidics is a powerful platform for a broad range of applications due to the advantages of high automatization and low reagent consumption. Pyrosequencing enables DNA sequencing based on non-electrophoresis bioluminescence, which is suitable for rapid and sensitive analysis of short sequences. Herein, we describe a palmtop sequencing platform for automatic, real-time and portable analysis of DNA mutations, which is based on the pyrosequencing principle and implemented by digital microfluidics. The portable system can sequence a DNA template with up to 53 bp with 100% accuracy within 2 h. Mutation in the KRAS gene can be detected within 30 min with a LOD as low as 5% mutant level, Portable and accurate gender identification was further demonstrated by sequencing a short amelogenin fragment. With the advantages of portability, ease of use, high accuracy, and low cost, the palmtop sequencing platform shows great potential for portable genetic testing in a variety of circumstances.

AB In this work, a boronate-affinity sandwich electrochemiluminescence (ECL) sensor was constructed to detect alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) based on a multiple signal amplification strategy. Gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) were utilized and modified on the surface with chitosan in order to facilitate electron transfer. The composite of the molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP) enhanced the selectivity of alpha-fetoprotein detection. 4-mercaptophenylboronic acid (MPBA) was used as the tracing tag for capture of alpha-fetoprotein. SiO2 nanoparticles carried carbon quantum dots (CQDs) labeled with gold nanoparticles and produced an ECL signal. Under the optimum experimental conditions, the linear range for alpha-fetoprotein was between 0.001 and 1000 ng/mL with a correlation coefficient of 0.9952, and the detection limit was 0.0004 ng/mL (S/N = 3). This proposed ECL sensor displayed several advantages, including outstanding selectivity, fine reproducibility, high sensitivity, low detection limit and wide linear range. Furthermore, the newly constructed boronate-affinity sandwich ECL sensor was successfully applied to the determination of alpha-fetoprotein in serum samples, indicating great potential for application in clinical diagnostics.

AB MicroRNAs serve as a new type of biomarker for multifarious diseases due to its critical roles in post transcriptional gene regulation. Herein, we firstly integrate the catalyzed hairpin assembly (CHA) and rolling circle amplification (RCA) into an electrochemical biosensor for sensitive and specific detection of miR-21. Meanwhile, an electric potential was employed to modulate the efficiency of CHA occurred on the electrode, which offer a simple but effective method to surmount the accessibility problem of probes. The biosensor achieved an ultra sensitive determination of miR-21 with a low limit of detection of 13.5 fM and a linear range from 15 fM to 250 pM. This research encourages us to challenge the hyphenated multiple amplification strategies and provides a stable and effective method for the detection of diseases-related miRNAs in peripheral biofluids, as well as paves a road for the future clinical diagnostics and treatment of disease.

AB In this study, we have fabricated a simple disposable electrochemical immunosensor for the point of care testing of microalbuminuria, a well-known clinical biomarker for the onset of chronic kidney disease. The immunosensor is fabricated by screen-printing carbon interdigitated microelectrodes on a flexible plastic substrate and utilizes electrochemical impedance spectroscopy to enable direct and label free immunosensing by analyzing interfacial changes on the electrode surface. To improve conductivity and biocompatibility of the screen-printed electrodes, we have modified it with gold nanoparticles, which are electrodeposited using linear sweep voltammetry. To enable efficient immobilization of HSA antibodies, we have developed novel PS/Ag/ab-HSA nanoprobes (polystyrene nanoparticle core with silver nanoshells covalently conjugated to HSA antibodies), and these nanoprobes are trapped on the electrode surface using dielectrophoresis. Each immunosensor has two sensing sites corresponding to test and control to improve specificity by performing differential analysis. Immunosensing results show that the normalized impedance response is linearly dependent on albumin concentration in the clinically relevant range with good repeatability. We have also developed a portable impedance readout module that can analyze the data obtained from the immunosensor and transmit it wirelessly for cloud computing. Consequently, the developed immunosensing platform can be extended to the detection of a range of immunoreactions and shows promise for point of diagnosis and public healthcare monitoring.

AB We developed self-linkable Prussian blue (PB)-incorporated magnetic graphene oxide (PMGO) as a peroxidase-mimicking nanozyme with high oxidizability to 3,3',5,5'-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB), which generates significant absorption intensity for the colorimetric immunosensing of apolipoprotein A1 (ApoA1) in early bladder cancer (BC) diagnosis and prognosis monitoring. The ultrasensitive immunosensor was constructed using an ApoAl antibody (Ab(ApoA1))-functionalized chip (biochip(ApoA1)) and self -linkable peroxidase-mimicking, PB-incorporated magnetic graphene oxide (PMGO). After incubating the sample and capturing ApoAl proteins captured on the biochip(ApoA1), the PMGO was functionalized with Ab(ApoA1), and then mouse IgG (PMGO-1), rabbit anti-mouse IgG antibody (PMGO-2), and goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody (PMGO-3) were added together. We envisioned that each captured ApoAl protein would allow the retention of a large amount of PMGO through a self-linking process to amplify the colorimetric signal of TMB in the presence of H2O2. The linear detection range could be obviously widened in the presence of self-linkable PMGO from 0.05 ng/mL to 100 ng/mL compared with the group without signal amplification (from 1 ng/mL to 100 ng/mL). Our immunosensor analysis of ApoAl in the urine of BC patients and healthy individuals was highly correlated with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay measurements; moreover, the ApoAl concentrations of patients with high-grade BC were significantly higher than those of patients with low-grade BC. After standard clinical treatment, a significant drop of ApoAl concentration occurred in urine that was lower than the cut-off concentration, suggesting potential clinical applications of the new self-linkable PMGO-generating colorimetric immunosensor in early BC diagnosis and prognosis monitoring.

AB A new immunoassay format using thermally induced defragmentation of some nitro-explosives with a high degree of selectivity is reported. Specific antibodies against three widely used explosives, 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT), 1,3,5-trinitroperhydro-1,3,5-triazine (RDX), and pentaerythritol tetranitrate (PETN) were generated by designing suitable haptens using geometry optimization modules. These in-house generated antibodies were used in a newly developed thermal mediated immunochemical biosensing technique which involves the binding of specific antibodies to respective nitro-explosives on a microtiter strip, resulting in the formation of specific immunocomplex. Heating the specific immuno-complex formed on microtiter wells resulted in thermal lysis of nitro-explosives to generate nitrite ions. These ions react with Griess reagent to form a colored chromophore which correlates the concentration of individual explosive in the sample. The present work fulfills the need for an improved explosive detecting system that is highly specific and capable of quickly determining the presence of nitrate containing explosives from a mixture pool.

AB Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) as a class of liquid biopsy is a type of gene fragment that contains tumor-specific gene changes in body fluids such as human peripheral blood. More and more evidences show that ctDNA is an excellent tumor biomarker for diagnosis, prognosis, tumor heterogeneity and so on. ctDNA is a tumor code in the blood. Liquid biopsy of ctDNA is firstly summarized. Compared with the traditional detection technologies of ctDNA, the biosensor is an excellent choice for the detection of ctDNA because of its portability, sensitivity, specificity and ease of use. This review mainly evaluates various biosensors applied to the detection of ctDNA. We discuss the most commonly used bioreceptors to specifically identify and bind ctDNA, including complementary DNA (cDNA), peptide nucleic acid (PNA) and anti-5 MethylCytosines, and the biotransducers which convert biological signals to analysable signs. The review also discusses signal amplification strategies in biosensors to detect ctDNA.

AB Human fecal contamination poses a crucial environmental and health threat in recent years, resulting in the difficulties of access to clean water. According to the World Health Organization, several fecal bacteria, particularly Enterococci species, are present in human intestinal flora. Enterococcus faecalis (E. faecalis) is one of the indicator bacteria that have been utilized as a pollution indicator in water. However, existing technologies and detection strategies face multiple challenges in terms of low affinity for detection and labelling requirements that limit their access to large scale applications. Here, we present a label-free molecular fingerprinting strategy on a plasmonic sensor to detect E. fecalis from aqueous and seawater samples. The kinetic performance of platform was comprehensively evaluated and the platform provided four orders of magnitude detection range with a low limit of detection (down to similar to 100 bacteria/mL) and a high correlation coefficient value ( > 0.99) in the range of 2 x 10(4)-1 x 10(8) cfu/mL. The platform also denoted a selectivity and specificity while other bacteria (E. coil, B. subtilis, and S. aureus) samples were applied. Multiple time use and relatively long shelf-life are superior to the existing modality. The presented method is one of the fascinating surface modification technique that utilizes biotarget as a recognition element itself, providing a broad range of versatility to replica other biotargets with different molecular structure, size, and physicochemical properties. Such a reliable and versatile platform would hold potential applications from microbiome characterization to forensics by revitalizing obsolescent detection strategies.

AB This paper presents the development of a multi-sensor platform capable of simultaneous measurement of dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration, glucose and lactate concentrations in a micro-chamber for real-time evaluation of metabolic flux in bovine embryos. A micro-chamber containing all three sensors (DO, glucose, and lactate) was made to evaluate metabolic flux of single oocytes or embryos at different stages of development in <= 120 mu L. of respiration buffer. The ability of the sensor to detect a metabolic shift from oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) to glycolysis was demonstrated in embryos by an ablation of oxygen consumption and an increase in lactate production following addition of oligomycin, an inhibitor of mitochondria] adenosine triphosphate (ATP) synthesis. An increased reliance upon glycolysis relative to OXPHOS was demonstrated in embryos as they developed from morula to hatched blastocysts by a progressive increase in the lactate/oxygen flux ratio, consistent with isolated metabolic assessments reported previously. These studies highlight the utility of a metabolic multi-sensor for integrative real-time monitoring of aerobic and anaerobic energy metabolism in bovine embryos, with potential applications in the study of metabolic processes in oocyte and early embryonic development.

AB Human pluripotent stem cell derived cardiomyocytes are a promising cell source for research and clinical applications like investigation of cardiomyopathies and therefore, identification and testing of novel therapeutics as well as for cell based therapy approaches. However, actually it's a challenge to generate matured adult cardiomyocyte-like phenotype in a reasonable time. Moreover, there is a lack of applicable non-invasive label free monitoring techniques providing quantitative parameters for analysing the culture stability and maturation status. In this context, we established an efficient protocol based on a combined differentiation of hiPSC in 2D cultures followed by a forced reaggregation step that leads to highly enriched ( >90% cardiomyocytes) cardiomyocyte clusters. Interestingly, 3D cultures revealed an accelerated maturation as well as phenotype switch from atrial to ventricular cardiomyocytes. More strikingly using combined impedimetric and electrophysiological monitoring the high functionality and long-term stability of 3D cardiomyocyte cultures, especially in comparison to 2D cultures could be demonstrated. Additionally, chronotropic as well as QT-prolongation causing reference compounds were used for validating the cardio specific and sensitive reaction over the monitored time range of more than 100 days. Thus, the approach of multiparametric bioelectronic monitoring offers capabilities for the long-term quantitative analysis of hiPS derived cardiomyocyte culture functionality and long-term stability. Moreover, the same multiparametric bioelectronic platform can be used in combination with validated long-term stable cardiomyocyte cultures for the quantitative detection of compound induced effects. This could pave the way for more predictive in vitro chronic/repeated dose cardiotoxicity testing assays.

AB Antibiotics such as penicillin and tetracycline drugs are widely used in food animals to treat, control, and prevent diseases, and penicillin is approved for use to improve growth rates in pigs and poultry. However, due to the overuse of antibiotics in food and medical industry, the antimicrobial resistance is starting to show up in some developing countries. The antibiotic abuse may cause allergic reactions, resistance in microorganisms and general lowering of immunity in consumers of meat and dairy products. It is important and necessary to develop an easy, inexpensive, and quantitative sensing method to monitor and analyze the antibiotics concentration in real samples such as milk or meat. In this research, an electrochemical biosensor based on hybrid nanowire/ nanoparticle array with various bio-molecular receptors was fabricated for the simultaneous detection of penicillin and tetracycline. The vertically aligned Pt-Au nanowire array has been prepared by an electrodeposition method within anodic aluminum oxide (AAO) membranes; L-cysteine was used to form a monolayer on the Au segment as the bio-receptor for tetracycline detection; electroless plating of Au nanoparticles was applied on the Pt nanowire segments, and then the penicillinase was immobilized on the Au nanoparticles using EDC/NHS cross-linker. The prepared Au(L-cysteine)-Pt(penicillinase) nanowire array electrode showed simultaneous detection ability and remarkably high sensitivity of penicillin and tetracycline, which are 41.2 mu A mu M-1 cm(-2) for penicillin detection and 26.4 mu A mu M-1 cm(-2) for tetracycline detection. The sensitivities of each analytes with different segment length were also investigated. Real sample tests with chicken and beef extract were conducted, which showed good recovery performance. Due to the advantages of the hybrid nanowire/nanoparticle array structure, this new sensor can serve as an enhanced platform for simultaneous detection of various bioanalytes.

AB Herein, we report an impedimetric DNA-based aptamer sensor for a single-step detection of B. anthracis spore simulant (B. cereus spore). Specifically, we designed a miniaturized label-free aptasensor for B. cereus spores based on a gold screen-printed electrode functionalized with B. cereus spores-binding aptamer (BAS-6R). Several parameters were optimized to fabricate the aptasensor such as the concentration of DNA aptamer solution (0.5 mu M), the time (48 h), the temperature (4 degrees C), and the pH (7.5) for aptamer immobilization on the working electrode surface. Once the aptasensor was developed, it was tested against B. cereus spores 14579 evaluating the effect of incubation time and MgCl2 concentration. Under the optimized conditions (incubation time equal to 3 h and absence of MgCl2), B. cereus spores 14579 were detected with a linear range between 10(4) CFU/ml and 5 x 10(6) CFU/ml and a detection limit of 3 x 10(3) CFU/ml. Furthermore, the study of selectivity toward B. cereus 11778, B. subtilis, Legionella pneumophila, and Salmonella Typhimurium has demonstrated the capability of this sensor to detect B. cereus spores, proving the suitability of the DNA-based sensing element combined with a portable instrument for a label-free measurement on site of B. anthracis spore simulant.

AB Graphene-oxide (GO) quenching-based molecular beacon was developed for rapid and sensitive detection of RNAs in living cells and tissues. Here, we applied GO quenching-based molecular beacon sensor to visualize neurogenic miR-193a levels delivered via exosomes during cell-non-autonomous neurogenesis in neural progenitor cells on a microfluidic platform. Exosomal transport was visualized using CD63-RFP plasmid vector, and FAM-labeled peptide nucleic acid (PNA) probe for the miR-193 sequence was designed to detect endogenous miR-193 expression. Fluorescence signals of FAM-PNA193a-GO were recovered in dibutyryl-cAMP-induced F11 cells, resulting from increased expression of miR-193a after neuronal differentiation. We observed delivery of miR-193a-containing exosomes released from differentiated donor F11 cells to recipient undifferentiated F11 cells. Fluorescence recovery was evident in exosome-stimulated recipient individual F11 cells in the microfluidic system. We propose molecular beacon imaging using PNA-GO complex for visualization of individual cellular expression of mature microRNAs. This system reveals the precise spatial localization and temporal sequences of mature miRNAs by intercellular exosomal delivery of messages for processes such as cell-non-autonomous neurogenesis.

AB DNA nanomaterials have been widely used in bioassays due to their promising properties for sensitive and specific detection of biomolecules. Herein, a label-free electrochemical method was developed for quantitative detection of microRNAs by integrating Y-shaped DNA (Y-DNA) structures with non-linear hybridization chain reaction (non-linear HCR). The Y-DNA structures consisting of three sequences (Y1, Y2 and Y3) serve as stable and specific probes for recognizing target miRNAs. In the presence of target miRNA, competitive hybridization occurs between miRNA and Y-DNA, resulting in the release of Y3 and the disintegration of the Y-DNA structure. The triggers, which were blocked by Y3 previously, were exposed and initiated the non-linear HCR. Remarkable electrochemical signal changes were produced after the isothermal amplification reaction. Therefore, the proposed biosensor achieved sensitive detection of microRNAs (miRNAs). Under optimal conditions, the limit of detection (LOD) was reduced to 0.3334 fM and linear range was from 1 fM to 10 pM. The special design of Y-DNA helped the biosensor obtain the ability to distinguish between single base mutations. What's more, this biosensor was capable of detecting miRNAs in clinical serum samples. We hope that this developed biosensor would provide a potential application for DNA nanomaterials in the field of microRNAs detection and inspire more interests in the development of DNA nanomaterial biosensors.

AB Antibiotic residue, as emerging pollution resulting from antibiotic abuse, poses a serious threat on ecosystem and human health. Conventional methods for antibiotic detection, e.g., liquid/gas chromatography, are based on complicated instruments and time-consuming; therefore, efforts have been made to realize in situ and real-time monitoring of antibiotics. Here, a miniaturized and integratable electronic antibiotic sensor based on field-effect transistor (FET) is reported. The reduced graphene oxide (rGO) nanosheet is used as the channel material and the aptamer RNA for tobramycin is modified onto rGO as the probe. A novel sensor design with 6-mercapto-lhexanol (MCH)/1-pyrenebutanol (PBA) blocking layer (BL) for structure optimization is applied to enhance the sensor reliability and specificity. This rGO/aptamer/BL sensor shows an ultra -sensitivity to tobramycin with a lower detection limit of 0.3 nM and a quick response within 5 s, as well as a high specificity over other antibiotics such as kanamycin, streptomycin, ciprofloxacin, and tetracycline. The sensing mechanism based on the deformation of the charged aptamer probe is proposed via an in-depth analysis of the interactions between aptamer, tobramycin and rGO. In addition, sensing test performed under controlled microfluidic flow conditions demonstrates a great potential of the sensors in practical applications.

AB Chips composed of microwell arrays integrating nanoelectrodes (OptoElecWell) were developed to achieve dual optical and electrochemical detections on isolated biological entities. Each array consists in 10(6) microwells of 6 pm diameter x 5.2 mu m height each, with a transparent bottom surface for optical observations, a platinum nano-ring electrode at its half-height for in situ electrochemistry, and a top open surface to inject solutions. Then, populations of individual mitochondria isolated from yeasts (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) were let to sediment on the array and be trapped within microwells. The trapping efficiency reached 20% but owing to the large number of microwells on the platform, hundreds of them could be filled simultaneously by single mitochondria. This allowed to follow up their individual energetic status based on fluorescence microscopy of their endogenous NADH. Simultaneously, the array of interconnected Pt nanoelectrodes in the microwells was used to monitor in situ variations of dioxygen consumed by all mitochondria captured in the device. Mitochondrial bioenergetics were modulated sequentially using respiratory chain-ATP synthase substrates (ethanol and ADP) and inhibitor (antimycin A). Overall, we show how two complementary analytical approaches, fluorescence and electrochemical detections, can be coupled for a multi-parametric monitoring of mitochondria] activities, with a resolution ranging from a small population (whole device) to the single mitochondrion level (unique well).

AB The tolerance, abuse, and potential exacerbation associated with classical chronic pain medications such as opioids creates a need for alternative therapeutics. Phenotypic screening provides a complementary approach to traditional target-based drug discovery. Profiling cellular phenotypes enables quantification of physiologically relevant traits central to a disease pathology without prior identification of a specific drug target. For complex disorders such as chronic pain, which likely involves many molecular targets, this approach may identify novel treatments. Sensory neurons, termed nociceptors, are derived from dorsal root ganglia (DRG) and can undergo changes in membrane excitability during chronic pain. In this review, we describe phenotypic screening paradigms that make use of nociceptor electrophysiology. The purpose of this paper is to review the bioelectrical behavior of DRG neurons, signaling complexity in sensory neurons, various sensory neuron models, assays for bioelectrical behavior, and emerging efforts to leverage microfabrication and microfluidics for assay development. We discuss limitations and advantages of these various approaches and offer perspectives on opportunities for future development.

AB Along with the advance in medical research, more biomarkers emerge as useful indicators for both disease and health index. However, majority of them have no practical or economic testing methods available yet, or rely on high-costing methods such as Enzyme-Linked Immuno-Sorbent Assay (ELISA), High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC), Mass Spectrum, and immunohistochemistry (IHC). In this article, we develop a universal nanozyme integrated testing platform for biological molecules that incorporates the electrochemical measurement of glucose with lateral flow immunostrip (LFS) for target analytes. This design involves the quantitative conversion of analytes into invertase and then glucose, which can be measured by an extremely affordable meter. The feasibility of this design was validated using 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) and prostate specific antigen (PSA) as representatives for small molecules and moderate to large proteins respectively. Our approach yields results comparable to commercial diagnostic ELISA kits at a substantially reduced cost and reaction time. Specifically, the design has a detection limit of 0.23 ng mL(-1) for 8-OHdG and 1.26 ng mL(-1) for PSA, and a detection range of 0.1-100 ng mL(-1) for 8.0HdG and 1-100 ng mL(-1) for PSA. By combining the accessibility of well-established glucose testing and LFS, our design can serve as a point of care testing method that can be fully integrated into the personal lifestyle without requiring professional assistance.

In particular, the principles and recent progress in different kinds of multiplex optical biosensors and their biological application were reviewed comprehensively. Sensors based on multi-plexed detection have absolute advantages in analysis throughput than single assay. The microfluidic chip, a type of micro-total analysis system (pTAS), provides an ideal platform for integration of high-throughput biosensors. Compared with electronic biosensors, benefitted from the technical development in Micro-Electro-Mechanical System, there have been greater advances in the fabrication of optical sensors and microfluidic chip, and then promoting microfluidic-chip integrated optical biosensors for simultaneous detection of multiple analytes.

AB Creatinine is a metabolic product of creatine phosphate in muscles, which provides energy to muscle tissues. Creatinine has been considered as indicator of renal function specifically after dialysis, thyroid malfunction and muscle damage. The normal level of creatinine in the serum and its excretion through urine in apparently healthy individuals is 45-140 mu M and 0.8-2.0 gm/day respectively. The level of creatinine reaches >1000 mu M in serum during renal, thyroid and kidney dysfunction or muscle disorder. A number of conventional methods such as colorimetric, spectrophotometric and chromatographic are available for determination of creatinine. Besides the advantages of being highly sensitive and selective, these methods have some drawbacks like time-consuming, requirement of sample pre-treatment, high cost instrumental set-up and skilled persons to operate. The sensors/biosensors overcome these drawbacks, as these are fast, easy, cost effective and highly sensitive. This review article describes the classification, operating principles, merits and demerits of various creatinine sensors/biosensors, specifically nanomaterials based biosensors. Creatinine biosensors work optimally within 2-900 s, potential range 0.1-1.0 V, pH range 4.0-10.0, temperature range 25-35 degrees C and had linear range, 0.004-30000 mu M for creatinine with the detection limit between 0.01.01 mu M and 520 mu M. These biosensors measured creatinine level in sera and urine samples and had storage stability between 4 and 390 days, while being stored thy at 4 degrees C. The future perspective for further improvement and commercialization of creatinine biosensors are discussed.

AB Microfluidic polymerase chain reaction (PCR) has been of great interest owing to its ability to perform rapid and specific nucleic acid amplification and analysis on small volumes of samples. One of the major drawbacks of microfluidic PCR is bubble generation and reagent evaporation, which can cause malfunctions. Here, through theoretical modeling and characterization of bubble behavior, we propose a bubble-free microfluidic PCR device via controlled fluid transfer. Our approach exploits a thin impermeable polyethylene (PE) top layer that minimizes the generation of bubbles by inhibiting mass transport along a vertical direction. Simulation results demonstrate that a calculated mass flow difference of approximately 370% can be obtained by utilizing an impermeable membrane as the vertical barrier layer. To demonstrate proof-of-concept, two nanoporous polymeric materials, poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) and PE, were used for stand-alone self-powered sample loading (approximately 70s) and for use as a vertical barrier layer, respectively. Consequently, we demonstrate successful amplification of the cMET gene, a nucleic acid (NA) biomarker for lung cancer, and complete an ultrafast PCR test in less than 3 min using a high powered Peltier-based thermal cycler under bubble-free conditions. This approach will result in a new paradigm for ultrafast molecular diagnosis and can facilitate NA-based nearly instantaneous diagnostics for point-of-care testing and for personalized and preventive medicine.

AB A porphyrin-based covalent organic framework (denoted as p-COF) was synthesized by a simple oil-bath method and exploited as a novel sensing layer for immobilizing epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-targeting aptamer strands to detect trace EGFR and living michigan cancer foundation-7 (MCF-7) cells for the first time. p-COF presented a nanosheet-like structure, large cavities, rich nitrogen-bearing groups, high electrochemical activity, excellent bioaffinity, low toxicity, and good stability in aqueous solution; the microstructural features of this material enabled strong immobilization of the aptamer strands. Interactions between the aptamer strands and EGFR significantly changed the electrochemical signals of the modified electrode due to the formation of an aptamer-EGFR complex. The p-COF-based aptasensor exhibited an extremely low detection limit (LOD) of 5.64 fg.mL.(-1) obtained from differential pulse voltammetry and 7.54 fg.mL(-1) originated from electrochemical impedance spectroscopy with a broad linear detection range of 0.05-100 pg.mL(-1) of the EGFR concentration. When detecting living MCF-7 cells, the p-COF-based aptasensor showed an LOD of 61 cell.mL(-1) with a linear detection range of 500 x 10(5) cell.mL(-1). The fabricated aptasensor exhibited high selectivity, good stability, reproducibility, acceptable recyclability, and favorable applicability in human serum samples. We believe that the developed p-COF-based aptasensor is a potential candidate for the sensitive detection of target cancer markers or living cells.

AB A color-sensitive and spectrometer-free sensing method using plasmonic nanohole arrays and the color components, L*, a*, and b*, of the CIELAB defined by the international commission on illumination (CIE) is introduced for the analysis of optically transparent materials in the visible range. Spectral analysis based on plasmonic nanoparticles or nanostructures can be applied to real-time bio-detection, but complex optical instrumentations and low spatial resolution have limited the sensing ability. Therefore, we take an advantage of color image processing instead of spectral analysis which induces the distinctive color information of plasmonic nanohole arrays with different transparent materials. It guarantees high spatial resolution which is essential to bio-detection such as living cells. To establish our sensing platform, the color components, L*, a*, and b*, were extracted from photo images by an image sensor, statistically processed using a JAVA program, and finally utilized as three individual sensing factors. Additionally, our study on a correlation between the spacing of plasmonic sensors and the color sensitivity to the refractive index reveals geometrically optimal conditions of nanohole arrays. The weighted mean calculation with the three individual sensing factors offers an enhanced distinction of the optical difference for transparent materials. In this work, a color sensitivity of 156.94 RIU-1 and a minimum mean absolute error of 1.298x10(-4) RID were achieved. The difference in the refractive index can be recognized up to 10(-4) level with the suggested sensing platform and the signal process. This unique color sensitive sensing method enables a simple, easy-to-control, and highly accurate analysis without complicated measurement systems including a spectrometer. Therefore, our sensing platform can be applied as a very powerful tool to in-situ label-free bio-detection fields.

AB Glutamate, a major excitatory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system, is essential for regulation of thought, movement, memory, and other higher functions controlled by the brain. Dysregulation of glutamate signaling is associated with severe neuropathological conditions, such as epilepsy, and glioma, a form of brain cancer. Glutamate signals are currently detected by several types of neurochemical probes ranging from microdialysis-based to enzyme-based carbon fiber microsensors. However, an important technology gap exists in the ability to measure glutamate dynamics continuously, and in real time, and from multiple locations in the brain, which limits our ability to further understand the involved spatiotemporal mechanisms of underlying neuropathologies. To overcome this limitation, we developed an enzymatic glutamate microbiosensor, in the form of a ceramic-substrate enabled platinum microelectrode array, that continuously, in real time, measures changes in glutamate concentration from multiple recording sites. In addition, the developed microbiosensor is almost four-fold more sensitive to glutamate than enzymatic sensors previously reported in the literature. Further analysis of glutamate dynamics recorded by our microbiosensor in cultured astrocytes (control condition) and glioma cells (pathological condition) clearly distinguished normal versus impaired glutamate uptake, respectively. These results confirm that the developed glutamate microbiosensor array can become a useful tool in monitoring and understanding glutamate signaling and its regulation in normal and pathological conditions. Furthermore, the developed microbiosensor can be used to measure the effects of potential therapeutic drugs to treat a range of neurological diseases.

AB A sensitive voltammetric sensor based on palladium nanoparticles (PdNPs) and poly-bromocresol green (pBG) composite layer immobilized on amide functionalized single-walled carbon nanotubes (AinSWCNTs) modified pyrolytic graphite (PdNPs:pBG/AmSWCNTs/PG) has been prepared for the simultaneous determination of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) catabolites, inosine (INO), hypoxanthine (HX), xanthine (XT), and uric acid (UA). The modified PdNPs:pBG/AmSWCNTs/PG was characterized by electrochemical experiments and surface analysis, which exhibited exceptional electrocatalytic effects towards the oxidation of INO, HX, XT, and UA with a significant enhanced peak current and well resolved peaks separation for all the analytes. The linear calibration curves were obtained in the concentration range of 0.001-175 mu M, 0.001-200 mu M, 0.001-150 mu M, and 0.001-200 mu M and limits of detection were found as 0.95 nM, 1.04 nM, 1.07 nM, and 0.43 nM corresponding to INO, HX, XT, and UA, respectively. The common metabolites present in the biological fluids did not interfere in the determination. The applicability of the proposed sensor was successfully demonstrated by determining INO, HX, XT, and UA in the human plasma and urine and the obtained results were validated by using HPLC.

AB An immunosensing biochip for simultaneous detection of three biomarkers related to acute myocardial infarction (AMI) was developed based on anionic soybean peroxidase (SBP) functionalized nanoprobe and chemiluminescent imaging. The nanoprobes (Ab2-SiO2-SBP) were fabricated by co-immobilization of SBP and one of the detection polyclonal antibodies, anti-cardiac troponin I antigen (anti-cTnI), anti-creatine kinase-MB (anti-CK-MB) and anti-myoglobin (anti-Myo), on the silica nanoparticle surface. The detection sensitivity was enhanced since the large surface area of silica carriers increased the loading of SBP for per sandwiched immunoreaction. The immunosensing biochip designed as 3 x 8 wells array was constructed by simultaneously immobilizing three capture monoclonal antibodies on the same one microtiter well with 2 x 3 active spots. In the presence of target protein, the nanoprobes will be attached onto the spots with high specificity through the sandwiched immunoreactions, which triggered the chemiluminescence (CL) signals on each sensing site of the microtiter plates and allowed to CL imaging of three biomarkers in one well at the same time. Therefore, the proposed biochip was a promising convenient strategy for simultaneous detection of cTnI, CK-MB and Myo, which showed potential application for multianalyte determination in clinical diagnostics.

AB Cancer is one of the most important causes of mortality in the world, which can be severely reduced by early detection to avoid future problems in the field of economics and mental health. Hence, electrochemical nanobiosensors as portable devices for rapid detection of cancer biomarkers, have found an important place in clinical medicine for diagnosis, managements or cancer screening. Although, these biosensors have been receiving attention in the recent years, their principles are unchanged. By progress in nanotechnology, a great potential has been giving to nanobiosensors. Applications of a wide variety of nanomaterials in developing electrochemical biosensors, led to the production of potential nanobiosensors. Due to the high electrical conductivity, and increased surface area relative to the volume along with more repeatability, the application of NPs in electrochemical biosensors has been developed. Therefore, in this review, we discussed the impact of nano materials on the accuracy of biosensors in early cancer detection such as lung, prostate, breast, and other cancers. However, the modification of electrode performance by nanomaterials is relatively complicated, which causes limitation for some nanomaterials to be used inbiosensor applications. Indeed, the construction of electrodes based on nanomaterial requires a simple, reliable and inexpensive route to increase the sensitivity and reproducibility. Thus, the aim of this study can be defined as determining the detection limit of electrochemical nanobiosensors as well as introducing the challenges of fabricating and designing electrochemical nanobiosensors based on nanomaterials and their evaluations in the future medical setting.

AB An ultrasensitive sandwich-type electrochemical immunosensor was designed by using gold nanoparticles (Au NPs) as the substrate material and microporous carbon spheres (CS) loading silver nanoparticles (Ag NPs) spaced Hemin/reduced graphene oxide (Hemin/rGO) porous composite materials (Ag NPs@CS-Hemin/rGO) as the detection antibodies (Ab(2)) label for detecting carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA). The Au NPs with good electrical conductivity and biocompatibility could accelerate the electron transfer on the electrode interface and enhance the load capacity of capture antibodies (Ab(1)). Hemin is peroxidase-like substance which has excellent catalytic ability for H2O2 reduction but easy to molecular aggregation and oxidative self-destruction. Reduced graphene oxide (rGO) is a good supporting material for Hemin to mitigate this disadvantage. CS loading Ag NPs (Ag NPs@CS) as the spacer inserts into Hemin/rGO sheet can overcome the irreversible stacking of rGO, and form complex porous structure which exposes more active sites of Hemin. Moreover, Ag NPs loaded on CS also has catalytic ability for H2O2 reduction. Thus the Ag NPs@CS-Hemin/rGO used as the Ab(2) label has a large working surface area and high utilization rate, which heightens the catalytic ability for H2O2 reduction to amplify the current signal effectually. The current signal and the logarithm of CEA concentration presented a wide linear response range of 20 fg/mL to 200 ng/mL, and the detection limit of CEA was 6.7 fg/mL. Furthermore, the designed immunosensor exhibited a good reproducibility, selectivity and stability, which confirms a broad development prospect when applying it in early clinical detection.

AB Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), which isa worldwide public health issue, is commonly associated with cardiovascular disorders (CVDs) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA). A smart nanosensor was developed for the detection of HIV and its related diseases (CVDs and RA) using graphene-based field-effect transistors (FETs). In this study, amine-functionalized graphene (afG) was conjugated with antibodies [anti-p24 for HIV, anti-cardiac troponin 1 (anti-cTn1) for CVDs, and anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (anti-CCP) for RA] to detect various biomarkers. The antibodies were covalently conjugated to afG via carbodiimide activation. The bioconjugate (graphene-antibody) was characterized by various biophysical techniques such as UV-Vis, Raman spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and atomic force microscopy (AFM). The electrochemical performance of the sensor was evaluated with respect to changes in the resistance of the electrode surface due to the interaction of the antigen with its specific antibody. The developed sensor was highly sensitive and showed a linear response to p24, cTn1, and, CCP from 1 fg/mL to 1 mu g/mL. The limit of detection (LOD) was 100 fg/mL for p24 and 10 fg/mL for cTn1 and CCP under standard optimized conditions. The graphene-based smart nanodevice demonstrated excellent performance; thus, it could be used for the on-site detection of HIV, CVD, and RA biomarkers in real samples.

AB Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), a gold-standard method for protein detection, has been widely utilized in disease diagnosis. Nevertheless, the method is constrained by its dependence on a colorimetric readout that, due to its relatively low sensitivity, prevents its use in tumor marker detection. Here we demonstrate an ELISA that incorporates an electro-readout mode in place of a colorimetric readout to achieve ultra sensitive and convenient tumor marker detection. Briefly, because hemin molecules supported by carbon sphere (CS) can catalyze dye degradation upon H2O2 addition, CS incorporating hemin was employed as a label. A hydrogel of sodium alginate-graphene oxide (SA-GO) affixed to an electrode was utilized as a support matrix to immobilize methylene blue (MB) for electrochemical signal generation. Using an ELISA like approach, a solution containing H2O2 was added to wells of 96-well plates containing preformed sandwiched immunocomplexes comprised of analyte, capture monoclonal antibody and signal antibody labeled with CS-supported hemin. When the hydrogel-modified electrode was immersed into a well containing a solution containing analyte immunocomplexes, the degradation of MB on the electrode was immediately triggered by label present within the immunocomplexes, resulting in a signal decrease dependent upon analyte concentration. Cancer antigen 125 was used as a model analyte to evaluate the improved ELISA. The calculated limit of detection was 0.048 mU mL(-1), which was over six-fold more sensitive than traditional ELISA, indicating that this strategy greatly improves ELISA sensitivity and holds great promise for the quantitative determination of biomarkers for use in clinical diagnosis.

AB This paper outlines a simple label-free sensor system for the sensitive, real time measurement of an important protein biomarker of sepsis, using a novel microelectrode integrated onto a needle shaped substrate. Sepsis is a life threatening condition with a high mortality rate, which is characterised by dysregulation of the immune response following infection, leading to organ failure and cardiovascular collapse if untreated. Currently, sepsis testing is typically carried out by taking blood samples which are sent to a central laboratory for processing. Analysis times can be between 12 and 72 h making it notoriously difficult to diagnose and treat patients in a timely manner. The pathobiology of sepsis is becoming increasingly well understood and clinically relevant biomarkers are emerging, which could be used in conjunction with a biosensor to support real time diagnosis of sepsis. In this context, microelectrodes have the analytical advantages of reduced iR drop, enhanced signal to noise ratio, simplified quantification and the ability to measure in hydrodynamic situations, such as the bloodstream. In this study, arrays of eight (r = 25 mu m) microelectrodes were fabricated onto needle shaped silicon substrates and electrochemically characterised in order to confirm successful sensor production and to verify whether the observed behaviour agreed with established theory. After this, the electrodes were functionalised with an antibody for interleukin-6 (IL-6) which is a protein involved in the immune response to infection and whose levels in the blood increase during progression of sepsis. The results show that IL-6 is detectable at physiologically relevant levels (pg/mL) with incubation times as short as 2.5 min. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) measurements were taken and DPV was concluded to be the more suitable form of measurement. In contrast to the accepted view for macro electrodes that the impedance increases upon antigen bind, we report herein a decrease in the micro electrode impedance upon binding. The small size of the fabricated devices and their needle shape make them ideal for either point of care testing or insertion into blood vessels for continuous sepsis monitoring.

AB In this study, a taste bud tissue biosensor was prepared by a starch-sodium alginate cross-linking fixation method. Capsaicin was used as a TRPV1 noxious ion channel activator to investigate the antagonism kinetics of six different substances on capsaicin. The results showed that capsazepine, AMG517, loureirin B, and tetrahydropalmatine were all competitive allosteric regulatory ligands for capsaicin, while aconitine and anandamide were mixed allosteric regulatory ligand that combines non-competition and competition effect. Through analyzing the kinetic parameters of capsaicin and its competitive allosteric regulatory ligands, and comparing the structures between spicy substances and endocannabinoids, the importance of amide groups and similar groups in the allosteric regulation of cannabinoids (CB) receptors and analgesic mechanism was elucidated. This indicates that vanilloid activators turn on the TRPV1 ion channel to transmit only pain and other nociceptive signals, while capsaicin and its competitive ligands are capable of activating intracellular G protein/PI3K/PIP2 signaling pathways by binding to endogenous cannabinoid receptors, and then increase intracellular PIP2 levels (the increasing PIP2 can competitively replace capsaicin and other vanilloid activators), thereby closing the TRPV1 channel and exerting the analgesic effect. The elucidation of this mechanism of pain and analgesia will lay the theoretical foundation and new ideas for investigating nociceptive signal and screening potential analgesic drugs.

AB A novel dual-color total internal reflection fluorescence biosensor (DTB) was successfully developed for the simultaneous detection of two small molecules based on a simple optical structure and the time resolved effect of fiber optic switch. The DTB employed a single-multi mode fiber optic coupler instead of a sophisticated confocal optical system for the transmission of two excitation lights and dual-color fluorescence, and a photodiode detector instead of photomultiplier for the simultaneous detection of dual-color fluorescence. The compact optical design of DTB improved its optical transmission efficiency and detection sensitivity because of no requirement of numerous optical separation elements and rigorous optical alignment. The DTB was applied for the simultaneous detection of 2,4-Bisphenol-A (BPA) and 2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) using one bifunctional fiber optic bio-probe modified by two hapten-protein conjugates. When the mixture of Cy5.5 labeled anti-2,4-D antibody and Pacific Blue dye labeled anti-BPA antibody was introduced over the surface of the bio-probe, they bound with their respective hapten-protein conjugate immobilized onto the bio-probe. Based on the time-resolved effect of fiber optic switch, two fluorescence dyes were alternatively excited by 635 nm and 405 nm laser lights and simultaneously detected by one photodiode detector. Taking indirect competitive immunoassay principle, BPA and 2,4-D were simultaneously detected using the DTB with high sensitivity, accuracy, and rapidity. The quantitation of affinity constants between small molecules and their antibodies was also achieved based on the proposed theory. The DTB provides a flexible and powerful platform for simultaneously sensitive quantitation of multiple targets and the affinity constants of biomolecular interactions.

AB Heparin is an indispensable drug in anticoagulation therapy but with a narrow therapeutic window, which dictates regular testing and dose adjustment. However, current monitoring tools have a long turnaround time or are operator intensive. In this work, we describe a cellulose-based photoacoustic sensor for heparin. The sensors have a turnaround time of 6 min for whole blood samples and 3 min for plasma samples regardless of heparin concentration. These sensors have a limit of detection of 0.28 U/ml] heparin in human plasma and 0.29 U/ml in whole blood with a linear response (Pearson's r = 0.99) from 0 to 2 U/ml heparin in plasma and blood samples. The relative standard deviation was < 12.5% in plasma and < 17.5% in whole blood. This approach was validated with heparin-spiked whole human blood and had a linear correlation with the activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) (r = 0.99). We then studied 16 sets of clinical samples these had a linear correlation with the activated clotting time (ACT) (Pearson's r = 0.86, P < 0.0001). The photoacoustic signal was also validated against the cumulative heparin dose (Pearson's r = 0.71, P < 0.0001). This approach could have applications in bed-side heparin assays for continuous heparin monitoring.

AB Graphene nanogap electrodes are reported here for the first time in an electrical biosensor for the detection of biomolecular interactions. Streptavidin-biotin was chosen as a model system for evaluating the sensor's performance. High-affinity interactions of streptavidin-gold nanoparticles (strep-AuNPs) to the biotin-functionalized nanogap localizes AuNPs, thereby bridging the gap and resulting in changes in device conductance. Biosensing performance was optimized by varying the gap size, AuNP diameter, and streptavidin coverage on AuNPs. The sensitivity and limit of detection (LOD) of streptavidin detection with the optimized parameters were determined to be 0.3 mu A/nM and 0.25 pM, respectively. The proposed platform suggests high potential as a portable point-of-use biosensor for the detection of other affinity-based biomolecular interactions, such as antigen-antibody, nucleic acid, or chemo-selective interactions.

AB A sensitive and specific photoelectrochemical (PEC) immunosensor was fabricated for subgroup J avian leukosis viruses (ALV-J) analysis based on a dual signal-on strategy. Gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) decorated graphitic carbon nitride (AuNPs/g-C3N4) as photoelectrochemical species and primary antibody (Ab(1)) against ALV-J were immobilized onto ITO electrode in turn. An ALP-CdTe-Ab(2) bio-conjugant was fabricated by assembling second antibody (Ab(2)) and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) to CdTe quantum dots (QDs) surface. The PEC immunosensor was fabricated by successively anchoring the target ALV-J and ALP-CdTe-Ab(2) bio-conjugants onto electrode surface via the immune recognition. By virtue of the matched energy levels between CdTe QDs and AuNPs/g-C3N4, ALP-CdTe-Ab(2) bio-conjugants could serve as the PEC active probes for photocurrent enhancement. Moreover, the photocurrent response could be further enhanced attributed to the ALP catalytic chemistry to in situ produce ascorbic acid for electron donating, achieving an effective dual signal-on mode for PEC assay. On the basis of the ALV-J titers-dependent photocurrent increment, the fabricated PEC immunosensor showed high sensitivity, specificity and stability for ALV-J assay in a wide linear range with a low detection limit of 85 TCID50/mL. This PEC immunosensor with the dual signal-on strategy may open up a promising platform for more target analytes in novel immune analysis and clinical diagnostics.

AB In view of the urgent need of determining polychlorinated biphenyls in the environment, we developed a highly sensitive and selective photoelectrochemical (PEC) aptasensor for determination of 3,3',4,4'-tetrachlorobiphenyl (PCB77) by immobilizing aptamer on N-doped TiO2 nanotubes (N-doped TiO2 NTs). To improve analytical performance of the PEC sensor, the complementary DNA functionalized CdS quantum dots (DNA-CdS QDs) were introduced onto N-doped TiO2 NTs by hybridization. In addition of PCB77, owing to high affinity of aptamer to PCB77, PCB77-aptamer complexes were formed by being bound of PCB77 whilst DNA-CdS QDs were released from the sensing surface. The complexes with poor conductivity hindered the interfacial electron transfer, leading to the photocurrent decrease. The more important is the release of DNA-CdS QDs enhanced the photocurrent decrease, playing the role of signal amplification. The photocurrent change was utilized to detect PCB77 quantitatively. The PEC aptasensor exhibited excellent analytical performance for detection of PCB77 with wide linear range of 0.1-100 ng/L and a low detection limit of 0.1 ng/L. It manifested outstanding selectivity for PCB77 in control experiments by employing six interferents which had similar structure or coexisted with PCB77. Besides, the PEC aptasensor was used to detect the content of PBC77 in the environment.

AB Molecularly imprinted technique (MIT) has proven to be a significant tool in the analyzing area in virtue of its obvious advantages such as specific recognition, favorable stability to high temperature and higher sensitivity. Electrochemiluminescence (ECL) technology has also been receiving enormous attention as a powerful tool in sensing fields. However, sensors based on the combination of MIT and ECL technologies have seldom been reported yet. Herein, we find that Ru(bpy)(3)(2+) cannot only work as an efficient catalyst for photo-induced electron transfer-reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer (PET-RAFT) polymerization, but also as a sensing probe for ECL sensor. Based on this, we successfully construct ECL sensors via the combination of MIT and ECL techniques. In details, poly(methacrylic acid) (PMAA) and cross-linked PMAA were synthesized first via a well-controlled PET-RAFT polymerization using Ru(bpy)(3)(2+) as catalyst under illumination of visible light with a wavelength of 460 nm, as confirmed by H-1 NMR and gel permeation chromatography (GPC). Then, negatively charged Au nanoparticles (AuNPs) with average sizes of 20 nm were prepared and modified with Ru(bpy)(3)(2+) via electrostatic incorporation. MIPs were prepared on the surface of AuNPs using melamine (MEL) as the template via PET-RAFT controlled cross-linking polymerization. The MIPs modified AuNPs (AuNPs-MIPs) were then fixed on the surface of working electrode with Nafion to achieve a solid-state ECL sensing platform employing Ru (bpy)(3)(2+) as the ECL probes. The as-prepared sensor showed a wide detection range of 5.0 x 10(-13) - 5.0 x 10(-6) mol/L and a low detection limit of 1.0 x 10(-13) mol/L (S/N >= 3) was reached in the detection of MEL. Moreover, further tests for analyzing MEL structural analogues proved that the constructed ECL sensing platform could be utilized to detect various substances via specific recognitions.

AB Cell viability evaluation is very meaningful for cancer treatment and cell proliferation is an effective evaluation criterion for cell viability. Traditionally, cell proliferation rate is obtained only by monitoring for several cell cycles (about 12 h) and yet there is no rapid assessment method to evaluate cell proliferation. In this paper, a rapid, real-time and online assessment approach (about 12.5 min) of cell proliferation based on electrical wound healing impedance characteristics is proposed to evaluate the cell proliferation rate and improve cell viability assessment. The electrical wounding threshold uth is firstly studied, then an electrical signal (u(1) < uth,) is applied to analyze cell recovery impedance characteristics, next an electrical signal (u(2) > uth) is applied to wound cells on the electrodes to death. The real-time monitoring of cell proliferation is realized by Chi660E. The results indicate that the speed of cell recovery and proliferation become slower with a higher concentration of H2O2 added. On this basis, a model of the relationship between cell recovery impedance characteristics and cell proliferation is built for cell proliferation evaluation. Finally, the effect of temperature on cell recovery is also discussed to provide theoretical support for influencing factors of the biosensor design.

AB Developing effective sensing method for trace analysis of ampicillin (AMP) is urgent and significant due to its residue possess serious threats to human health. Herein, a p-n heterojunction, on the basis of p-type BiFeO3 nanoparticles coupled n-typed ultrathin graphite-like carbon nitride (utg-C3N4) nanosheets, has been designed and synthesized via a simple electrostatic interaction strategy. Such p-n heterojunction has two advantages: one is capable to narrow the band gap of photoactive materials from 2.20 eV of BiFeO3 down to 2.04 eV of BiFeO3/utg-C3N4, leading to improve the efficiency of visible light utilization; and the other is to facilitate the charge separation rate, resulting in the boosted photoelectrochemical (PEC) performance of BiFeO3/utg-C3N4. Under visible light illumination, the photocurrent of the resulted BiFeO3/utg-C3N4 was 7.0-fold enhanced than that of pure BiFeO3 nanoparticles, and indeed 2.3-fold enhanced comparing to BiFeO3/bulk-C3N4. Based on excellent PEC properties of BiFeO3/utg-C3N4, an on-off-on PEC aptasensor was successfully fabricated for ampicillin (AMP) determination with highly selectivity and sensitivity. The fabricated PEC aptasensor exhibited excellent PEC performance with a broad linear in the range from 1 x 10(-12) mol L-1 to 1 x 10(-6) mol L-1 as well as a low detection limit of 3.3 x 10(-13) mol L-1 (S/N = 3), and also good feasibility in real sample. The excellent analytical performance indicated that PEC aptasensor on the basis of the visible light driven BiFeO3/utg-C3N4 heterojunction can provide a promising biosensor platform for sensitive detection AMP in food and environment analysis.

AB Wearable enzymatic biofuel cells would be the most prospective fuel cells for wearable devices because of their low cost, compactness and flexibility. As the high specificity and catalytic properties of enzymes, enzymatic biofuel cells (EBFCs) catalyze the fuel associated with the redox reaction and get electrical energy. Available biofuels such as glucose, lactate and pyruvate can be harvested from biofluids of sweat, tears and blood, which afford cells a favorable use in implantable and wearable devices. However, the development of wearable enzymatic biofuel cells requires significant improvements on the power density and enzymes lifetime. In this paper, some new advances in improving the performance of wearable enzymatic biofuel cells are reviewed based on the bioanode and biocathode by classifying single-enzyme and multi-enzyme catalysis system. Thereinto, the bioanode usually contains oxidases and dehydrogenases as catalyst, and the biocathode utilizes the catalysis of multi-copper oxidases (MCOs) in the single system. For further enhancing the power density, efforts to develop multi-enzyme catalysis strategies are discussed in bioanode and biocathode respectively. Moreover, some potential technologies in recent years, such as carbon nanodots, CNT sponges and mixed operational/storage electrode are summarized owing to notable efficiency and the capability of enhancing electron transfer on the electrode. Finally, major challenges and future prospects are discussed for the high power output, stable and practical wearable enzymatic biofuel cells.

AB An electrochemical biosensor was designed for the determination of telomerase activity using an enzyme-free, PCR-free, and convenient electrochemical strategy. In this work, the electrochemical biosensor was constructed through the functionalization of Au nanorods with a carboxylic group (AuNRs-3) and subsequent immobilization with capture DNA (cDNA) for sensing telomerase activity. Upon telomerase triggered extension, the telomerase activity is related to the amount of the adsorbed electrocatalyst, leading to the different electrochemical signals for readout. Integrating with the efficient electrocatalysis of AuNRs-3-cDNA towards oxidation of acetaminophen, the prepared biosensor exhibits a wide dynamic correlation of telomerase activity from 1 x 10(2) to 1.04 x 10(7) HeLa cells mL(-1) with a sensitivity of 2.68 HeLa cell mL(-1) and the limit of detection was calculated to be 52.81 HeLa cells mL(-1) under the optimal experimental conditions. Furthermore, the application of this electrochemical biosensor would provide the great potential for analysis of telomerase activity, revealing a powerful platform for early diagnosis of cancers.

AB An electrochemiluminescence (ECL) analytical platform was initially proposed based on the electrochemiluminescence resonance energy transfer (ECL-RET) mechanism for ultrasensitive detection of Concanavalin A (Con A). In this protocol, the glucose functionalized carboxylic g-C3N4 nanosheets (g-C3N4-COOH@Glu) and MnO2 nanoparticles covered carboxylic multi-wall carbon nanotubes (BSA@MnO2-MWCNTs-COOH@Glu) were synthesized and acted as ECL-RET electron donor and acceptor, respectively. Herein, glucose was served as the recognition element for binding Con A and MWCNTs was utilized as the carrier materials for loading MnO2. When the quenching probe BSA@MnO2-MWCNTs-COOH@Glu was incubated onto the modified electrodes via the specific carbohydrate-Con A interaction, the ECL signals of g-C3N4-COOH@Glu which used S2O82- as its coreactant have drastically declined. Under optimum conditions, this biosensor performed a sensitive detection of the Con A ranging from 1 x 10(-5) to 1 x 10(4) ng/mL with a detection limit of 2.2 fg/mL (S/N = 3). Moreover, favorable analytical outcomes for detecion Con A in actual serum samples were obtained, exhibiting huge applications in clinical diagnosis of this assay.

AB Electrochemical sensors are very versatile and can be used for a diverse range of biomedical applications. In this paper, a novel fully-integrated wireless electrochemical sensing platform is presented. The platform uses standard semiconductor technology to create a miniaturized integrated bioelectronics system that consists of an electrochemical sensor, potentiostat, signal processing circuitry, wireless power harvesting circuitry, and wireless telemetry unit, all on a single microchip. The platform is orders of magnitude smaller than the state-of-the-art sensing systems and costs a fraction. At 1.4 mm x 1.4 mm size, the sensor costs less than $1 to manufacture. The presented design provides fundamental advantages in decreasing sensor noise and settling time, thus providing superior response compared to existing solutions. System design and implementation details are presented as well as examples for metabolic sensing (glucose, lactate, O-2) applications. The system can have widespread applications in biosensing applications.

AB Activity of alpha-amylase enzyme in human serum indicates the onset of pancreatitis, mumps, cancer, stress, and depression. Herein we design and develop a biosensor for the point-of-care-testing (POCT) of alpha-amylase concentration in serum. The biosensor is composed of a glass substrate coated with an electrically conducting poly-aniline-emeraldine-salt (PANI-ES) film covered with starch-coated gold nanoparticles (SAuNPs). Addition of different dosage of alpha-amylase on the biosensor selectively depletes starch stabilized on the SAuNPs, which changes the electrical resistance of the sensor. The change in electrical resistance show a nearly linear correlation with the concentration of alpha-amylase in buffer, which helps the detection of unknown alpha-amylase activity in the blood serum. The biosensor responds in a specific manner owing to the use of selective enzymatic chemical reaction between alpha-amylase and starch. The pathways to SAuNP formation on PANI-ES, time-dependent starch digestion with alpha-amylase, and the subsequent variation in electrical response was characterized to uncover the sensing mechanism. The chloride ions and the AuNPs present catalyse the starch-amylase reaction on the PANI surface to enable a sensitive detection of alpha-amylase in serum (25 - 100 U/l) at a quick response time of similar to 60 s. Integration of the biosensor with the built-in sourcemeter and a real time display help an immediate presentation of alpha-amylase level in the serum, comparable to the clinically approved methodologies.

AB Smartly coupling exonuclease-induced target recycling signal amplifications with beta-cyclodextrin host-guest recognition, a novel "signal-on" aptamer sensor for sensitive determination of ochratoxin A (OTA) was proposed for the first time. Firstly, the formation of double-strand DNA (dsDNA) was occurred by hybridizing OTA aptamer with its complementary DNA (cDNA) and as the probe DNA the cDNA at its 3' terminal was labeled with methylene blue (MB). Next, when OTA was present, the aptamer tended to form aptamer-OTA complex with conformation of G-quadruplex instead of aptamer-cDNA duplex, leading to thus the probe DNA separating from dsDNA complex. Then the RecJf exonuclease was added, demolishing partially G-quadruplex structure and releasing a certain number of OTA. Sequentially, those released OTA would continue to react with the rest of aptamer in dsDNA, drawn into development of a new round of G-quadruplex complex, where the target cycling was realized. Meanwhile, as a signal molecule, MB modified on cDNA was liberated along with the cDNA being digested into monoucleotides by RecJf exonuclease, capable of diffusing onto the electrode surface due to host guest recognition with beta-cyclodextrin, whereupon the signal was enriched and yielded. In this way, cycles of target with continuous output of signal indicators were undergone, in which the detection of target was in return fulfilled with signal amplification owing to the joint endeavor of exonuclease and beta-cyclodextrin. Under the optimal conditions, the raising signal maintained a linear relation with the logarithm of the target concentrations ranging from 10 pg/mL to 10.0 ng/mL and the detection limit reached as low as 3 pg/mL. This brand-new strategy was simple and low-cost but satisfactory in terms of detection limit, range and sensitivity, in all possibility to be applied extensively for diverse targets detection by easily alternating the corresponding aptamers.

AB An electroanalysis strategy has been developed for probing glutathione (GSH) separately in hela and yeast cells based on the displacement reaction route using melamine-copper (MA-Cu) nanocomposites. Herein, MA-Cu nanocomposites were initially synthesized by the controlled supermolecular self-assembly process showing various morphological structures depending on the MA-to-Cu ratios used. It was discovered that the electrodes modified with rod-like MA-Cu nanocomposites could achieve the stable electrochemical output of solid-state CuCl at a low potential, which might circumvent the possible interference from co-existing electroactive substances in complicated backgrounds like cells. More importantly, the yielded Cud signals would decrease selectively induced by GSH through the specific Cu-GSH interaction that would trigger the displacement of CuCl into non-electroactive complex. The MA-Cu nanorods-modified electrodes can allow for the detection of GSH with the concentrations linearly ranging from 0.010 to 300.0 mu M. Subsequently, the feasibility of the developed electroanalysis strategy was demonstrated for the evaluation of GSH separately in the extractions of hela and yeast cells, promising the wide applications in the clinical and food analysis fields.

AB Flexible biosensors form part of a rapidly growing research field that take advantage of a multidisciplinary approach involving materials, fabrication and design strategies to be able to function at biological interfaces that may be soft, intrinsically curvy, irregular, or elastic. Numerous exciting advancements are being proposed and developed each year towards applications in healthcare, fundamental biomedical research, food safety and environmental monitoring. In order to place these developments in perspective, this review is intended to present an overview on field of flexible biosensor development. We endeavor to show how this subset of the broader field of flexible and wearable devices presents unique characteristics inherent in their design. Initially, a discussion on the structure of flexible biosensors is presented to address the critical issues specific to their design. We then summarize the different materials as substrates that can resist mechanical deformation while retaining their function of the bioreceptors and active elements. Several examples of flexible biosensors are presented based on the different environments in which they may be deployed or on the basis of targeted biological analytes. Challenges and future perspectives pertinent to the current and future stages of development are presented. Through these summaries and discussion, this review is expected to provide insights towards a systematic and fundamental understanding for the fabrication and utilization of flexible biosensors, as well as inspire and improve designs for smart and effective devices in the future.

AB For electrochemical biosensors, just like a computer, the modularization and coordinated operation of different components will facilitate the development of versatile biosensors and effectively reduce costs. However, the efficient synergy between different modules is always difficult. It would be a beneficial way to construct the multi-functional module. In this work, a three-dimensional gold nanoparticles/ferrocene/liposome cluster (GFLC) is fabricated and explored as a building block for the fabrication of an electrochemical biosensor, in which gold nanoparticles, ferrocene and liposome cluster work as a signal amplification component, a signal output component and a molecular recognition component, respectively. With the synergy of multi-functions, GFLC has been successfully applied for electrochemical analysis of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in food samples. LPS can be linearly assayed in the range from 2 x 10(-9) mu g/mL to 8 mu g/mL with a detection limit of 0.51 x 10(-10) mu g/mL. In view of the favorable modularization effect, GFLC shows a great potential in the development of electrochemical biosensor with considerable versatility and cost-efficiency.

AB Herein we report a simple, one-step approach to prepare a low-cost and binder free MoS2-pencil graphite electrode (i.e., MoS2-PGE) for the electrochemical oxidation of DNA nucleobases i.e., guanine (G) and adenine (A) in physiological pH (7.4) buffer solution. MoS2-PGE was synthesised by hydrothermal method and the morphology of such hybrid was characterized by field emission scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, Raman and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. In cyclic voltammetry, MoS2-PGE displays two well-seprated and well-defined irresversible peaks at 0.58 and 0.90 V for electrochemical oxidation of G and A respectively when compared to bare PGE. Likewise, differential pulse voltammetry of MoS2-PGE showed well-seprated and sharp peak current responses for G and A at 0.56 V and 0.85 V respectively. Under optimized conditions, DPV was further adopted for simultaneous and separation-free determination of G and A in physiological pH. MoS2-PGE shows good stability with linear range of 15-120 mu M and 15-120 mu M for G and A detection respectively. Obtained sensitivity and limit of detection (signal-to-noise = 3) are comparable with the previous literature. As an immediate practical applicability, MoS2-PGE was used for quantification of G and A concentration in calf thymus DNA and detected ratio of G and A (i.e., [G]/[A]) ratio is 0.85. The current approach provides a new avenue towards the development of affordable electrodes for a wide range of bioanalytical applications.

AB Cardiomyocytes (CM) placed on microelectrode array (MEA) were simultaneously probed with cantilever from atomic force microscope (AFM) system. This electric / nanomechanical combination in real time recorded beating force of the CMs cluster and the triggering electric events. Such "organ-on-a-chip" represents a tool for drug development and disease modeling. The human pluripotent stem cells included the WT embryonic line CCTL14 and the induced dystrophin deficient line reprogrammed from fibroblasts of a patient affected by Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD, complete loss of dystrophin expression). Both were differentiated to CMs and employed with the AFM/MEA platform for diseased CMs' drug response testing and DMD characterization. The dependence of cardiac parameters on extracellular Ca2+ was studied. The differential evaluation explained the observed effects despite variability of biological samples. The beta-adrenergic stimulation (isoproterenol) and antagonist trials (verapamil) addressed ionotropic and chronotropic cell line-dependent features. For the first time, a distinctive beating-force relation for DMD CMs was measured on the 3D cardiac in vitro model.

AB Aberrant hypermethylation of CpG islands in the promoter region of tumor suppressor genes is a promising biomarker for early cancer detection. This methylation status is reflected in the methylation pattern of ctDNA shed from the primary tumor; however, to realize the full clinical utility of ctDNA methylation detection via liquid biopsy for early cancer diagnosis, improvements in the sensitivity and multiplexability of existing technologies must be improved. Additionally, the assay must be cheap and easy to perform in a clinical setting. We report the integration of methylation specific PCR (MSP) to melt curve analysis on giant magnetoresistive (GMR) biosensors to greatly enhance the sensitivity of our DNA hybridization assay for methylation detection. Our GMR sensor is functionalized with synthetic DNA probes that target methylated or unmethylated CpG sites in the MSP amplicon, and measures the difference in melting temperature (T-m) between the two probes (Delta T-m), giving an analytical limit of detection down to 0.1% methylated DNA in solution. Additionally, linear regression of Delta T-m's for serial dilutions of methylated:unmethylated mixtures allows for quantification of methylation percentage, which could have diagnostic and prognostic utility. Lastly, we performed multiplexed MSP on two different genes, and show the ability of our GMR assay to resolve this mixture, despite their amplicons' overlapping T-m's in standard EvaGreen melt analysis. The multiplexing ability of our assay and its enhanced sensitivity, without necessitating deep sequencing, represent important steps toward realizing an assay for the detection of methylated ctDNA in plasma for early cancer detection in a clinical setting.

AB We intended to develop a novel biosensor using gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) for indicating different concentrations of E. coli O157:H7 and smart phone imaging APP for monitoring color change of the AuNPs. The magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) modified with the capture antibodies and the polystyrene microspheres (PSs) modified with the detection antibodies and the catalases were simultaneously used to react with the target bacteria in the first mixing channel of the microfluidic chip, and hydrogen peroxide was injected and catalyzed by the catalases on the MNP-bacteria-PS complexes. After the mixture of the AuNPs and the crosslinking agents were injected to react with the catalysate in the second mixing channel and incubated in the detection chamber, the aggregation of the AuNPs was triggered through the crosslinking agents, resulting in the color of the AuNPs changing from blue to red. Finally, the color was measured using the smart phone imaging APP to determine the amount of the bacteria. This biosensor exhibited a good specificity and sensitivity for detection of E. coli O157:H7 in chicken samples with a lower detection limit of 50 CFU/mL.

AB Cell-based assays including both cell identification assays and cell functional assays are broadly used in life science research and for medical applications. Traditionally, cell-based assays are performed in professional laboratories. Although such an approach is reliable, it significantly limits the accessibility of cell-based assays by many researchers without specialized cell imaging facilities and does not permit on-site use at most clinics. Over recent years, growing efforts have been made to overcome this limitation by developing various portable cell imaging platforms. Herein, we provide a timely review on the recent development of portable imaging systems and their biomedical applications. We describe the respective applications of three main classes of portable imaging technologies including miniaturized microscope, lens-free imaging device and smartphone-based microscope for cell-based assays. We conclude by discussing our views on the opportunities, problems and future directions of this emerging field.

AB Bacterial infections are causing worldwide morbidity and mortality. One way to limit infectious outbreaks and optimize clinical management of infections is through the development of fast and sensitive sensing of bacteria. Most sensing approaches are currently based on immunological detection principles. We report here on an impedimetric sensor to selectively and sensitive detect uropathogenic E. coil cells (E. coil UTI89) using artificial recognition sites. We show here the possibility to imprint the rod-shape structure of E. coli UTI 89 into ultra-thin inorganic silica coatings on gold electrodes in a reproducible manner. A linear range from to 1 x 10(0) -1 x 10(4) cfu mL(-1) is obtained. With a detection limit for E. coil UTI89 below 1 cfu mL(-1) from five blank signals (95% confidence level) and excellent selective binding capabilities, these bacterial cell imprinted electrodes brings us closer to a low cost specific bacterial recognition surfaces.

AB Graphene has emerged as a novel material with enhanced electrical and structural properties that can be used for a multitude of applications from super-capacitors to biosensors. In this context, an ultra-sensitive biosensor was developed using a low-cost, simple and mask-free method based on laser-induced graphene technique for electrodes patterning. The graphene was produced on a polyimide substrate, showing a porous multi-layer structure with a resistivity of 102.4 +/- 7.3 Omega/square. The biosensor was designed as a 3-electrode system. Auxiliary and working electrodes were made of graphene by laser patterning and the reference electrode was handmade by casting a silver ink. A molecularly-imprinted polymer (MIP) was produced at the working electrode by direct electropolymerization of eriochrome black T (EBT). As proof-of-concept, the MIP film was tailored for chloramphenicol (CAP), a common contaminant in aquaculture.
   The resulting device was evaluated by cyclic voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy readings against a redox standard probe. The limit of detection (LOD) was 0.62 nM and the linear response ranged from 1 nM to 10 mM. These analytical features were better than those produced by assembling the same biorecognition element on commercial graphene- and carbon-based screen-printed electrodes.
   Overall, the simplicity and quickness of the laser-induced graphene technique, along with the better analytical features obtained with the graphene-based electrodes, shows the potential to become a commercial approach for on-site sensing.

AB The present work describes a new, simple, and easy method of generating acrylamide functionalised reduced graphene oxide-fullerene layer-by-layer assembled dual imprinted polymers to quantify D- and L-Serine at ultra trace level in aqueous and real samples. Herein, the pencil graphite electrode was initially spin coated with D-Serine imprinted acrylamide functionalized reduced graphene oxide. After 10 min thermal treatment (50 degrees C), this electrode was again modified with L-Serine imprinted acrylamide functionalized fullerene molecules. This bilayer assembly was finally made thermally stable by 60 degrees C exposure for 3 h. The proposed sensor showed better electronic properties with an improved synergism. We have compared this modified electrode with other modified pencil graphite electrodes like single layered acrylamide functionalised reduced graphene oxide or fullerene, single layered acrylamide functionalised reduced graphene oxide-fullerene composite and double layered acrylamide functionalised reduced graphene oxide or fullerene molecules, which yielded very inferior sensitivity due to possible agglomeration and decreased synergism. The chosen system demonstrated a very good analytical figures of merit with differential pulse anodic stripping voltammetry and cyclic voltammetry transduction, showing lower limits of detection (0.24 ng mL(-1), S/N = 3) for both isomers. The proposed sensor assures practical applications as disease biomarker, manifesting several diseases at very ultra-trace level.

AB Exosomes have been reported to play an important role in the anti-tumor immune response, tumor diagnosis and other processes, and are promising biomarkers for early cancer diagnosis. In this work, a sensitive electrogenerated chemiluminescence (ECL) biosensor was developed for detection of exosomes using aptamer modified two-dimensional material Ti3C2 MXenes nanosheets as the ECL nanoprobe because of its large surface area, the excellent conductivity and catalytic properties. The exosomes can be high efficiently captured onto the electrode surface by an EpCAM protein recognized aptamer modified on the electrode surface. In addition, the ECL nanoprobe can also recognize the exosomes, and significantly enhanced the ECL signals of luminol. Based on this strategy, a highly sensitive ECL biosensor for MCF-7 exosomes detection was obtained. The detection limit is 125 particles mu L-1, which was over 100 times lower than that of conventional ELISA method. The as prepared ECL biosensor was performed successfully for MCF-7 exosomes detection in the serum. This strategy provided a feasible, sensitive and reliable tool for the exosomes detection in exosomes-related clinical diagnostics.

AB In this work, Pt nanoparticles modified nanoporous AuSn(Pt@NP-AuSn) alloy on Ni buffered flexible carbon fiber paper (CFP) is fabricated by a simple replacement reaction in which NP-AuSn is fabricated by controllable dealloy of electrodeposited Au-Sn alloy films. The as prepared Pt@NP-AuSn/Ni/CFP possesses hierarchical pore structure, high specific surface area and excellent catalytic activity. Due to the bi-functions of both the large surface area of nanoporous metal and macroporous of carbon fiber paper facilitating mass transfer, the Pt@NP-AuSn/Ni/CFP shows high sensitivity of detecting ascorbic acid (AA), dopamine (DA) and uric acid (UA), with sensitivities of 0.14 mu A mu M-1 cm(-2), 15.23 mu A mu M-1 cm(-2), 0.28 mu A mu M-1 cm(-2) under the concentration ranging from 200 to 2000 mu M, 1-10 mu M, and 25-800 mu M for AA, DA and UA, respectively. Further, the Pt@NP-AuSn/Ni/CFP possesses long-term stability of sensing AA, DA and UA and presents great anti-interference towards a variety of common compounds in body fluid. All of these results manifest the Pt@NP-AuSn/Ni/CFP can be a promising candidate for the application of the electrochemical sensor for simultaneous detection of AA, DA and UA.

AB Telomerase and microRNAs (miRNAs) as important biomarkers are closely related to cancers. Simultaneous detection of telomerase activity and miRNAs would be beneficial to improve the specificity and reliability. Here, we establish a telomerase and miRNA-21 (miR-21) simultaneous sensing platform with graphene oxide-based fluorescent aptasensors (GOFA) including graphene oxide (GO), template strand (TS) primer and fluorophore-labeled telomerase/miR-21 oligonucleotides. Owing to pi-pi stacking interaction, TS primer and telomerase/miR-21 probes would be loaded onto GO, resulting in fluorescence quenching. However, in the presence of the telomerase or miR-21, the double-stranded oligonucleotides would be away from the GO surface attribute to the hybridization between the extended TS primers and telomerase probe as well as miR-21 and miR-21 probe, leading to obvious fluorescence recovery. We found that GOFA could simultaneously detect telomerase activity and miR-21 with low background signal, high sensitivity and simplified operation. Moreover, GOFA could be used for accurately detecting telomerase activity and miRNA in living cells and cancer patient tissue sample. This sensing platform shows great potential in improving the accuracy in clinical diagnosis of cancer.

AB Sepsis is one of the leading causes of mortality among critically ill patients globally. According to WHO report 2018, it is estimated to affect beyond 30 million people worldwide every year. It causes loss of human lives, which arise from infection and inflammation and long term stay in intensive care unit (ICU) in hospitals. Despite the availability of satisfactory prognostic markers contributing to the diagnosis of sepsis, millions of people die even after admission to the hospitals. Correct and early diagnosis of sepsis leads to rapid administration of appropriate antibiotics can thus potentially avert the attainment to critical stages of sepsis, thereby saving human lives. Conventional diagnostic practices are costly, time consuming and they lack adequate sensitivity and selectivity, provoking an urgent need for developing alternate sepsis diagnosis systems. Nevertheless, biosensors have the much-treasured scope for reasonable sepsis diagnosis. Advancement in nano-biotechnology has provided new paradigm for biosensor platforms with upgraded features. Here, we provide an overview of the recent advances in biosensors with a brief introduction to sepsis, followed by the conventional methods of diagnosis and bio-sensing. To conclude, a proactive role and an outlook on technologically advanced biosensor platforms are discoursed with possible biomedical applications.

AB Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) systems are most important in the current Type I diabetes care and as component for the development of artificial pancreas systems because the amount of insulin being supplied is calculated based on the CGM results. Therefore, to stably and accurately control the blood glucose level, CGM should be stable and accurate for a long period. We have been engaged in the biomolecular engineering and application of FAD dependent glucose dehydrogenase complex (FADGDH) which is capable of direct electron transfer. In this study, we report the development of the third-generation type open circuit potential (OCP) principle-based glucose sensor with direct electron transfer FADGDH immobilized on gold electrodes using a self-assembled monolayer (SAM). We developed a novel algorithm for OCP-based glucose sensors. By employing this new algorithm, high reproducibility of measurement and sensor preparation were achieved. In addition, the signal was not affected by the presence of acetaminophen and ascorbic acid in the sample solution. The thus optimized third-generation OCP-based glucose sensor could be operated continuously for more than 9 days without significant change in the signal, sensitivity and dynamic range, indicating its potential application for CGM systems.

AB Achieving the enhanced sensitivity and stability is always the pursuit for the fabrication of enzymatic biosensors. However, their sensitivity was still restricted by the fluctuant detection target (e.g. concentration), complex detection environment and limited recognition capability of enzymes. Herein, an effective and facile approach was designed to construct a bi-enzymatic and bi-nanospherical signal amplification system for fabrication of biosensors based on the designed polydopamine(PDA)-laccase@Au-glucose dehydrogenase. Therein, laccase-catalytic polymerized PDA nanoparticles (NPs) provided the supporting matrix for immobilization of laccase and AuNPs. The AuNPs with good conductivity and large surface area were used not only as a platform for enhanced loading capacity of glucose dehydrogenase but also as a conducting medium for electron transfer acceleration between enzymes and electrode. Moreover, the coordinated catalysis of bi-enzymes (laccase and glucose dehydrogenase) could avoid the fluctuated concentration of detection target (e.g. norepinephrine), while the application of bi-nanospheres loaded with large amount of enzymes could effectively amplify the signal of biosensors. Taking advantages of these merits, the as-prepared biosensors showed preeminent reproducibility, larger detection range from 0.5 nM to 0.5 mu M, and lower detection limit of 0.07 nM (S/N = 3) for the nor epinephrine detection. Besides, the constructed PDA-laccase@Au-glucose dehydrogenase was also successfully applied as the sensing probes for the detection of microRNA (miRNA), especially for single-nucleotide mismatched miRNA via specific recognition.

AB The low concentrations of cancer biomarkers in the blood have limited the utility of quantitative bioassays developed for the purpose. The advent of nicking endonucleases (NEases) as signal amplification tools have greatly enhanced the detection efficiency and provided a multi-optional platform to design target specific detection methods. The present review focuses on the prominent features of NEases, modified DNA probes (such as hairpin (HP) probes, molecular beacons, and G- quadruplex) that mediate cyclic cascade and role of helper enzymes. Application of NEase assisted signal amplification (NESA) has been discussed for diagnosis of two prominent cancer biomarkers viz. DNA methyl transferase (Dam MTase) and microRNA (miRNA). NESA mediated techniques such as rolling circle amplification (RCA), strand displacement amplification (SDA) and isothermal exponential amplification (EXPAR), have been compared in light of their future applications in clinical diagnosis. Significance of nanomaterials to achieve further amplification and NESA assays for simultaneous detection of miRNAs has also been conversed. It is anticipated that the information gained from the analyses of the prospects and limitations of NESA-based assays will be useful towards understanding the applications, and improvement of efficient isothermal exponential amplification strategies for highly sensitive and selective detection of cancer biomarkers.

AB A constitutively increased intracellular pH that is higher than the extracellular pH is emerging as a hallmark of cancer and determining pH could play a significant role in the measurement of drug responsiveness of tumor cells. However, a non-invasive, touch-free and real-time pH sensing as a research tool is lacking and remains a major unmet need. The purpose of the current study is to investigate a microfluidic surface acoustic wave (SAW) sensor platform capable of monitoring pH in cell and tumoroid cultures. A novel multi-layer guided SAW sensor integrated into a microfluidic channel was investigated theoretically and experimentally in detail for pH biosensing. Sensitivity and capability of the layer guided Love wave device was modeled using the finite element simulation. The model was verified experimentally, and a study monitoring pH of cell growth media is presented. This novel pH sensor is based on a 13.91 MHz center frequency SAW device coated with ZnO (500 nm) and IrO2 (30 nm) layers to increase the sensitivity. A change in mechanical and electrical properties of the conductive IrO2 layer was observed resulting from electrical corrosion induced by pH solutions affecting the charge distribution, SAW phase velocity and attenuation. By measuring the frequency shift induced by the change in SAW phase velocity between the test group and control group, the pH value of cell culture media from H460 cancer cell culture plates from day 0 to day 5 can easily be determined. To improve the sensitivity and stability of the sensor, a finite element method was used to optimize the layer thicknesses. Taken together, the results of experiments show the potential application of this device to be integrated with microfluidic channels and used in determining pH changes in longitudinal tumor cell cultures.

AB Performance of a glucose-driven bio-battery was improved by enhancing electrode characteristics and oxygen supply efficiency to a cathode. The bio-battery generates electric power from glucose through three enzymatic reactions using glucose dehydrogenase, diaphorase and bilirubin oxidase. A flexible and thin Pt electrode was employed instead of a glassy carbon (GC) electrode on which enzymes, a coenzyme, and mediators were immobilized by layer-by-layer method. The maximum current and power densities of the constructed bio-battery were 257 +/- 22 mu A/cm(2) and 86 +/- 3 mu W/cm(2), respectively, in 5 mM glucose solution. In addition, a newly designed compact gas/liquid diaphragm cell, which allowed to reduce the internal resistance by shortening the anode-cathode distance and enhance oxygen supply to a cathode using a highly-porous cotton mesh diaphragm, was implemented to the bio-battery to develop a high-performance Air bio-battery. As a result, improved Air bio-battery showed the maximum current and power densities of 451 +/- 27 mu A/cm(2) and 162 +/- 7 mu W/cm(2), which was 3.6-fold improvement from the previous GC electrode-based bio-battery. In addition, continuous operation for 210 min revealed high stability of power generation as it decreased by 3.3% at the end of operation. Additional supply of oxygen to a cathode exhibited proportional increase of the power density to the oxygen concentration, which demonstrates a promising potential of Air bio-battery for a high-performance and continuous powering device.

AB A simultaneous testing of the trace catechol (CC) and hydroquinone (HQ) was achieved via an ultrasensitive phenolic biosensor constructed by the truncated cube-shaped gold/Prussian blue analogue (Au/PBA) nano-composites. A facile charge-assembly strategy was developed to drive the successive mutual attractions for the crystallization among [Fe(CN)(6)](3-), Co2+, and [AuCl4](-) reactants, benefiting the in-situ growth of Au nano-particles on all faces of the PBA truncated nanocubes. On account of this special architecture, numerous 10 nm Au particles can rapidly gather the electrons from the enzyme reaction to a PBA crystal due to their high conductivity, and then the current signals will be significantly magnified through the reversible redox of the PBA. Using this nanomaterial, the as-prepared biosensor has shown an extreme wide linear range (CC: 0.2-550 mu M, HQ: 1-550 mu M) and an ultralow detection limit (CC: 0.06 +/- 0.001 mu M, HQ: 0.3 +/- 0.007 mu M) for the independent detections of CC and HQ. More importantly, when the two targets coexist, this biosensor can simultaneously exhibit the obvious and accurate responses of CC and HQ at the different potentials (0.17 V for CC and 0.07 V for HQ) with the high sensitivities and rare mutually interferences.

AB Many genetic reporter systems require molecular oxygen; therefore, the use of reporter genes to study molecular mechanisms in anaerobic microorganisms has been hampered by the lack of convenient reporting systems. We describe reporter gene whole cell-based biosensor systems based on luciferase genes and the associated oxygen requiring enzymes. By using two different oxygen-dependent reporters, insect and bacterial luciferases, and two bacterial hosts, Gram (+) Bifidobacterium longum and Gram (-) Escherichia coli, we show that the enzymes can be used in gene expression studies of anaerobic bacteria. E. coli, a facultative anaerobe, was grown both in aerobic and anaerobic conditions with an arabinose-inducible expression system. We show that a short treatment time of few minutes in ambient atmosphere is sufficient to detect light emission from living cells that is directly proportional to the number of cells and to the inducer concentration. The induction levels were the same in both the aerobically and anaerobically cultured cells. Similar results were obtained in the case of B. longum cultured in anaerobic conditions.

AB A simple, facile and sensitive photoelectrochemical (PEC) bioassay protocol for metronidazole (MNZ) detection in common oral medicine samples has been proposed under visible-light irradiation, where novel hierarchical coral-like g-C3N4 nanoarchitectures (cg-C3N4) have been first explored as PEC sensing platform. Featured with the unique nanostructures (e.g., interlaced porous network architecture, and open boundaries), the as-formed cgC(3)N(4) nanoarchitectures not only efficiently inhibit the recombination of photogenerated electron-hole but also enable the immobilization of capture antibodies as well as the antibody-antigen binding efficiency fluently, thus amplifying the photocurrent response. This newly constructed PEC immunoassay displays excellent performance for MNZ determination with high sensitivity and selectivity. Under the optimal condition, this bioassay protocol exhibits a linear range of 0.01-100 mu M with a detection limit of 0.005 mu M at signal to noise ratio of 3. The resulting PEC immunoassay has been proved to be applicable for sensing MNZ in common oral medicine samples.

AB This study describes a novel electrochemical aptasensor for detection of alpha-synuclein (alpha-syn) oligomer, an important biomarker related to Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases. The sensing platform is based on exonuclease I (Exo I), terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) and methylene blue. The aptasensor exploits the improved sensitivity because of applications of TdT and Exo I and also a label-free aptamer (Apt). Furthermore, direct immobilization of complementary strand of aptamer (CS) instead of Apt on the surface of electrode prohibits Apt self-assembled monolayer aggregation and keeps the function of the Apt. In the absence of alpha-syn oligomer, TdT enhances lengths of Apt and CS and so, increases accumulation of methylene blue as redox agent on the surface of electrode, leading to a strong current signal. While in the presence of alpha-syn oligomer, Exo I digests CS on the electrode surface, resulting in less accumulation of methylene blue on the electrode surface and a weak current signal. The relative electrochemical signal of the aptasensor increased linearly with the logarithm of alpha-syn oligomer concentration in the range from 60 pM to 150 nM. The detection limit was 10 pM. Furthermore, the sensor showed high precision and repeatability for detection of repeatability-syn oligomer in serum samples.

AB Gold nanoparticle (GNP)-labeled immunochromatography test strip (ICTS) has been widely used in different fields, but its sensitivity still require further improvement. In this work, a rapid and quantitative test strip detection method based on the photothermal effect of GNPs was established using a temperature sensor. A portable sensor device was fabricated based on the above method, and the main operating parameters were optimized. Three types of analyte models (cells, macromolecules, and small molecules) were chosen to evaluate the application of the sensor device using the commercial ICTS. The detection limit is at least 1 order of magnitude lower than that of the traditional visual detection ICTS. The other strip type of dot immunogold filtration test was adopted to further improve the sensitivity. The sensitivity of the sensor detection method was similar to that of the infrared camera method, and the proposed sensor device has obvious advantage of low-cost, as well as the usage of a small portable instrument, ease of use and rapid test. The portable sensor device based on the photothermal effect of GNPs can be used as a new and promising device for simple, quantitative, rapid, and on site screening of analyte by ICTS.

AB This work accounts the influence of facet effect of Co3O4 nanocrystals towards nonenzymatic electrocatalysis of glucose induced by different crystal planes modified on carbon cloth (CC) electrode. Tuning the molar ratio of precursor compounds during hydrothermal synthesis of Co3O4, followed by thermal decomposition protocols, different crystal structure including nanocubes, nanothorns, nanooctahedrons and nanosheets were obtained with respective {001}, {110}, {111} and {112} facets. The electrochemical results of these different Co3O4 crystals demonstrate that the nanooctahedron with crystal plane of {111} displays the best nonenzymatic electro-catalytic glucose activity with widest linear range (0.5-1000 mu M), highest sensitivity (246.8 mu A mM(-1)) and detection limit of 0.012 mu M (S/N = 3). Interestingly, the electrocatalytic activity for nonenzymatic electrocatalytic glucose is ranked in the order of {111) > {112} > {110} > {001}.

AB There has been a continuous strive to develop portable, stable, sensitive and low cost detection system for malaria to meet the demand of effective screening actions in developing countries where the disease is most endemic. Herein, we report an aptamer-based field effect transistor (aptaFET) biosensor, developed by using an extended gate field effect transistor with inter-digitated gold microelectrodes (ID mu E) for the detection of the malaria biomarker Plasmodiwn falciparum glutamate dehydrogenase (PfGDH) in serum samples. A 90 mer long ssDNA aptamer (NG3) selective to PfGDH was used in the aptaFET to capture the target protein. The intrinsic surface net charge of the captured protein led to change in gate potential of the aptaFET device, which could be correlated to the concentration of the protein. This biosensor exhibited a sensitive response in broad dynamic range of 100 fM - 10 nM with limits of detection of 16.7 pM and 48.6 pM in spiked buffer and serum samples, respectively. The high selectivity of the biosensor for PfGDH was verified by testing relevant analogous human and parasitic proteins on the device. Overall, the results validated the application potential of the developed aptaFET for diagnosis of both symptomatic and asymptomatic malaria.

AB Urea is the major end product of nitrogen metabolism in humans, which is eliminated from the body mainly by the kidneys through urine but is also secreted in body fluids such as blood and saliva. Its level in urine ranges from 7 to 20 mg/dL, which drastically rises under patho-physiological conditions thus providing key information of renal function and diagnosis of various kidney and liver disorders. Increase in urea levels in blood, also referred to as azotemia or uremia. The chronic kidney disease (CKD) or end stage renal disease (ESRD) is generally caused due to the progressive loss of kidney function. Hence, there is an urgent need of determination of urea in biological fluids to diagnose these diseases at their early stage. Among the various methods available for detection of urea, most are complicated and require time-consuming sample pre-treatment, expensive instrumental set-up and trained persons to operate, specifically for chromatographic methods. The biosensing methods overcome these drawbacks, as these are simple, fast, specific and highly sensitive and can also be applied for detection of urea in vivo. This review presents the principles of various analytical methods for determination of urea with special emphasis on biosensors. The use of various nanostructures and electrochemical microfluidic paper based analytical device (EiPAD) are suggested for further development of urea biosensors.

AB Fabricating novel bimetallic metal organic framework (MOF) architectures and exploiting them as aptasensor scaffolds for detecting diverse analytes, especially cancer markers, have aroused widespread research attention. Herein, we report a novel strategy for obtaining ZnZr bimetallic MOFs via the MOF-on-MOF method and exploit them as an aptasensor platform for detecting the cancer marker protein tyrosine kinase-7 (PTK7). Basic characterizations reveal that the chemical structure, crystalline properties, and surface functionality of bimetallic Zn-Zr-MOFs can be modulated by changing the order of addition of metal precursors and organic ligands. The Zn-MOF-on-Zr-MOF hybrid exhibits a hierarchically decussated foliace, whereas Zr-MOF-on-Zn-MOF demonstrates a multilayered nanosheet structure. The electrochemical results reveal that Zr-MOF facilitates aptamer strand immobilization, whereas the Zn-MOF stabilizes the G-quadruplex formed by aptamer strands and PTK7. The Zn-MOF-on-Zr-MOF-based aptasensor outperforms the Zr-MOF-on-Zn-MOF-based one, providing ultralow detection limits of 0.84 and 0.66 pg mL(-1), as obtained by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and differential pulse voltammetry, respectively, within the PTK7 concentration range of 1.0 pg mL(-1) to 1.0 ng mL(-1). The proposed Zn-MOF-on-Zr-MOF-based aptasensor exhibits high selectivity in the presence of various interferences, good stability, reproducibility, and acceptability in human serum. The proposed strategy provides a new approach for fabricating ultrasensitive and selective bimetallic MOFs-based aptasensors and contributes to efforts to broaden their applications in early cancer diagnosis.

AB Owning to the misuse of the antibiotics in animal husbandry and agriculture, it is highly urgent to determine the quantification of antibiotics in biological systems by the simple, sensitive, and fast method. In this work, a novel nanoarchitecture of Co-based metal-organic frameworks (Co-MOF) and terephthalonitrile-based covalent organic framework (TPN-COF) was synthesized (represented by Co-MOF@TPN-COF), followed by the exploitation as the bioplatform of non-label aptasensor for detecting the most frequently used beta-lactam antibiotics, ampicillin (AMP). The new porous hybrid material of Co-MOF@TPN-COF was synthesized by adding the as-prepared TPN-COF into the Co-MOF preparation system. The multilayered Co-MOF@TPN-COF nanosheets exhibit a high specific surface area (52.64 m(2) g(-1)), nitrogen-rich groups and excellent electrochemical activity. As a result, large amounts of aptamer strands can be bound over the Co-MOF@TPN-COF nanosheets owning to the strong n-ic stacking and hydrogen bonds. When detecting AMP by the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, the fabricated Co-MOF@TPN-COF-based aptasensor exhibits an ultra-low detection limit of 0.217 fg(-1) within the AMP concentration from 1.0 fg(-1) to 2.0 ng(-1), which was superior to those previously reported in literatures. In addition, this proposed aptasensor also shows high selectivity, good reproducibility and stability, acceptable regenerability, and favorable applicability in human serum, river water and milk. Therefore, the proposed Co-MOF@TPN-COF-based aptasensor has a great promise to be applied as a powerful tool in the fields of food safety.

AB We present a rapid and label-free method for hematologic screening for diseases and syndromes, utilizing quantitative phase imaging (QPI) and machine learning. We aim to establish an efficient blood examination framework that does not suffer from the drawbacks of conventional blood assays, which are incapable of profiling single cells or require labeling procedures. Our method involves the synergistic employment of QPI and machine learning. The high-dimensional refractive index information arising from the QPI-based profiling of single red blood cells is processed to screen for diseases and syndromes using machine learning, which can utilize high-dimensional data beyond the human level. Accurate screening for iron-deficiency anemia, reticulocytosis, hereditary spherocytosis, and diabetes mellitus is demonstrated (> 98% accuracy) using the proposed method. Furthermore, we highlight the synergy between QPI and machine learning in the proposed method by analyzing the performance of the method.

AB Nature is a great source of inspiration for the development of solutions for biomedical problems. We present a novel biosensor design utilizing two-photon polymerisation and graphene to fabricate an enhanced biosensing platform for the detection of motile bacteria. A cage comprising venous valve-inspired directional microstructure is fabricated around graphene-based sensing electronics. The asymmetric 3D micro-structure promotes motile cells to swim from outside the cage towards the inner-most chamber, resulting in concentrated bacteria surrounding the central sensing region, thus enhancing the sensing signal. The concentrating effect is proved across a range of cell cultures - from 10(1) CFU/ml to 10(9) CFU/ml. Fluorescence analysis shows a 3.38-3.5 times enhanced signal. pH sensor presents a 2.14-3.08 times enhancement via the detection of cellar metabolite. Electrical measurements demonstrate an 8.8-26.7 times enhanced current. The proposed platform provides a new way of leveraging bio-inspired 3D printing and 2D materials for the development of sensing devices for biomedical applications.

AB Measurement of glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) is a gold standard procedure for assessing long term glycemic control in individuals with diabetes mellitus as it gives the stable and reliable value of blood glucose levels for a period of 90-120 days. HbA1c is formed by the non-enzymatic glycation of terminal valine of hemoglobin. The analysis of HbA1c tends to be complicated because there are more than 300 different assay methods for measuring HbA1c which leads to variations in reported values from same samples. Therefore, standardization of detection methods is recommended. The review outlines the current research activities on developing assays including biosensors for the detection of HbA1c. The pros and cons of different techniques for measuring HbA1c are outlined. The performance of current point-of-care HbA1c analyzers available on the market are also compared and discussed. The future perspectives for HbA1c detection and diabetes management are proposed.

AB Here we present a new method to fabricate enzyme-mimic metal-free catalysts for electrochemical detection of superoxide anion (O-2(center dot-)) by introducing phosphate groups into graphene-based foam. Through a template-free hydrothermal process, graphene oxide (GO) was treated with different amount of phytic acid (PA) to obtain 3D porous graphene-based foam (PAGF). Characterizations demonstrate that phosphate groups were successfully modified on the surface and inter layer structure of PAGF materials and the defects and disorder degree of PAGF could be controlled by adjusting the addition of PA precursors. Meanwhile, the synthesized PAGF was successfully immobilized on screen printed carbon electrodes (SPCEs) and employed in O-2(center dot-) detection. With PA treated on graphene structure, the resulted PAGF/SPCEs exhibit distinct characteristic redox peaks, showing enzyme-mimic catalytic activity toward O-2(center dot-) dismutation. Also, the amount of modified phosphate groups has caused a considerable variety on the performance of PAGF-based electrodes. Apart from high sensitivity, wide liner range, low detection limit, good selectivity and long-term stability, our sensors also present satisfying performance in the real-time monitoring of drug-induced O-2(center dot-) released from Hela cells. The reliability of the biological measurement was further demonstrated via electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) to characterize the released O-2(center dot-) from stimulated cells by using 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl (TEMPOL) to trap the transient O-2(center dot-). The above results indicate that our established sensors hold potential application in the real-time detection of O-2(center dot-) in biological samples.

AB A totally organic and disposable electrochromic timer integrated with an enzymatic electrode and powered by biofuel cells is developed. The cathode of the self-powered electrochromic timer consists of a composite electrochromic film of poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) and polyurethane (PU), while the anode is made up of a fructose dehydrogenase (FDH) enzymatic electrode. The electrochromic changes over time (up to 100 min) can be displayed in the device, and the speed of color change can be controlled by changing the resistance between the anode and the cathode. Automatic activation of the timer after placement on a skin is achieved by integrating a porous microneedle array. The electrochromic timer would be used along with a skin patch as a time-lapse display of medical and cosmetic treatments.

AB Fungi-derived flavin adenine dinucleotide glucose dehydrogenases (FADGDHs) are currently the most popular and advanced enzymes for self-monitoring of blood glucose sensors; however, the achievement of direct electron transfer (DET) with FADGDHs is difficult. In this study, a designer FADGDH was constructed by fusing Aspergillus flavus derived FADGDH (AfGDH) and a Phanerochaete chrisosporium CDH (PcCDH)-derived heme b-binding cytochrome domain to develop a novel FADGDH that is capable of direct electron transfer with an electrode. A structural prediction suggested that the heme in the CDH may exist in proximity to the FAD of AfGDH if the heme b-binding cytochrome domain is fused to the AfGDH N-terminal region. Spectroscopic observations of recombinantly produced designer FADGDH confirmed the intramolecular electron transfer between FAD and the heme. A decrease in pH and the presence of a divalent cation improved the intramolecular electron transfer. An enzyme electrode with the immobilized designer FADGDH showed an increase in current immediately after the addition of glucose in a glucose concentration-dependent manner, whereas those with wild-type AfGDH did not show an increase in current. Therefore, the designer FADGDH was confirmed to be a novel GDH that possesses electrode DET ability. The difference in the surface electrostatic potentials of AfGDH and the catalytic domain of PcCDH might be why their intramolecular electron transfer ability is inferior to that of CDH. These relevant and consistent findings provide us with a novel strategic approach for the improvement of the DET properties of designer FADGDH. (241 words)

AB Hairpin DNA (hpDNA) loops were used for the first time as molecular binding elements in gas analysis. The hpDNA loops sequences of unpaired bases were studied in-silico to evaluate the binding versus four chemical classes (alcohols, aldehydes, esters and ketones) of volatile organic compounds (VOCs). The virtual binding score trend was correlated to the oligonucleotide size and increased of about 25% from tetramer to hexamer. Two tetramer and pentamer and three hexamer loops were selected to test the recognition ability of the DNA motif. The selection was carried out trying to maximize differences among chemical classes in order to evaluate the ability of the sensors to work as an array. All oligonucleotides showed similar trends with best binding scores for alcohols followed by esters, aldehydes and ketones. The seven ssDNA loops (CCAG, TTCT, CCCGA, TAAGT, ATAATC, CATGTC and CTGCAA) were then extended with the same double helix stem of four base pair DNA (GAAG to 5' end and CTTC to 3' end) and covalently bound to gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) using a thiol spacer attached to 5' end of the hpDNA. HpDNA-AuNPs were deposited onto 20 MHz quartz crystal microbalances (QCMs) to form the gas piezoelectric sensors. An estimation of relative binding affinities was obtained using different amounts of eight VOCs (ethanol, 3-methylbutan-1-ol, 1-pentanol, octanal, nonanal, ethyl acetate, ethyl octanoate, and butane-2,3-dione) representative of the four chemical classes. In agreement with the predicted simulation, hexamer DNA loops improved by two orders of magnitude the binding affinity highlighting the key role of the hpDNA loop size. Using the sensors as an array a clear discrimination of VOCs on the basis of molecular weight and functional groups was achieved, analyzing the experimental with principal components analysis (PCA) demonstrating that HpDNA is a promising molecular binding element for analysis of VOCs.

AB Physiological processes, such as respiration, circulation, digestion, and many pathologies alter oxygen concentration in the blood and tissue. When designing culture systems to recapitulate the in vivo oxygen environment, it is important to integrate systems for monitoring and controlling oxygen concentration. Herein, we report the design and engineering of a system to remotely monitor and control oxygen concentration inside a device for 3D cell culture. We integrate a photonic oxygen biosensor into the 3D tissue scaffold and regulate oxygen concentration via the control of purging gas flow. The integrated phosphorescence-based oxygen biosensor employs the quenching of palladium-benzoporphyrin by molecular oxygen to transduce the local oxygen concentration in the 3D tissue scaffold. The system is validated by testing the effects of normoxic and hypoxic culture conditions on healthy and tumorigenic breast epithelial cells, MCF-10A cells and BT474 cells, respectively. Under hypoxic conditions, both cell types exhibited upregulation of downstream target genes for the hypoxia marker gene, hypoxia-inducible factor la (HLF1A). Lastly, by monitoring the real-time fluctuation of oxygen concentration, we illustrated the formation of hypoxic culture conditions due to limited diffusion of oxygen through 3D tissue scaffolds.

AB Tuberculosis (TB) remains one of the leading causes of mortality worldwide. There is a great need for the development of diagnostic tests, which are reliable, sensitive, stable, and low cost to enable early diagnosis of TB in communities with scarce resources. This study reports the optimization and evaluation of a synthetic receptor, an aptamer, for the detection of the secreted protein MPT64, which is a highly immunogenic polypeptide of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, a causative agent of TB. The study investigates combinatorial effects of an aptamer linker and a co-adsorbent onto a gold electrode for optimal binding efficiency and reduced non-specific interactions for label-free detection of MPT64 using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. Two types of co-adsorbents and two types of aptamer linkers were studied and high specificity and sensitivity to MPT64 was observed for a surface prepared with a thiol PEGylated aptamer HS-(CH2)(6)-OP(O)(2)O-(CH2CH2O)(6)-TTTTT-aptamer and 6-mercaptohexanol in a ratio of 1:100. The developed aptamer-based sensor was successfully used with spiked human serum sample with a limit of detection of 81 pM This work demonstrates the use of the MPT64 aptamer as a lower cost, more sustainable and stable alternative of antibodies for the development of point-of-care TB biosensors decreasing the detection time from several days or hours to thirty minutes.

AB Here we report the first mediated microneedles-based biosensor for minimally invasive continuous sensing of lactate in the dermal interstitial fluid (ISF). To further demonstrate the capability of microneedle arrays as second generation biosensors we have functionalized gold microneedles with nanocarbons at which mediated electron transfer of lactate oxidase takes place. In particular the gold surface of the microneedles electrode has been modified in 3 subsequent steps: i) electrodeposition of Au-multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs); ii) electropolymerization of the mediator, methylene blue (MB); iii) immobilization of the enzyme lactate oxidase (LOX) by drop-casting procedure.
   The resulting microneedle-based LOX biosensor displays an interference-free lactate detection without compromising its sensitivity, stability, selectivity and response time.
   The performance of the microneedle array, second generation biosensor for lactate detection was assessed in artificial interstitial fluid and in human serum, both spiked with lactate. The results reveal that the new microneedles lactate sensor holds interesting promise for the development of a real-time monitoring device to be used in sport medicine and clinical care.

AB In this study, we report a cognate pair of the aptamer-based sandwich-type electrochemical biosensor for type 2 diabetes biomarker (Vaspin) using coccolith modified electrodeposited on the screen-printed gold electrode (CME-SPGE). The coccolith derived from E. huxleyi used in this study were known to be highly-structured microparticles with many nano-sized pores. The CME-SPGE was successfully fabricated by drop-casting coccoliths, followed by Au sputtering and electrodeposition of Au. On this CME-SPGE electrode, the sandwich-type electrochemical aptasensor was fabricated by using a cognate pair of aptamers. The morphological, electrochemical characteristics and the performances of both the CME-SPGE and the completely fabricated sandwich type aptasensor were investigated by SEM, EDAX, cyclic voltammetry, and chronoamperometry. Due to the synergic effect of a cognate pair of aptamers on CME-SPGE, this newly developed sandwich-type electrochemical biosensor for Vaspin showed high specificity, and good sensitivity with a limit of detection (LOD) of 298 pM, along with more widen the linear range. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report about the use of a coccolith modified electrode with a cognate pair aptamer resulting in sandwich-type binding in an electrochemical biosensor. With the advantages of using highly-structured biomineral microparticles and a cognate pair of aptamers, this new study may pave the innovative way to design a novel sandwich-type electrochemical aptasensor platform.

AB Recent years, an explosive growth of wearable technology has been witnessed. A highly stretchable and sensitive wearable strain sensor which can monitor motions is in great demand in various fields such as healthcare, robotic systems, prosthetics, visual realities, professional sports, entertainments, etc. An ideal strain sensor should be highly stretchable, sensitive, and robust enough for long-term use without degradation in performance. This review focuses on recent advances in polymer nanocomposite based wearable strain sensors. With the merits of highly stretchable polymeric matrix and excellent electrical conductivity of nanomaterials, polymer nanocomposite based strain sensors are successfully developed with superior performance. Unlike conventional strain gauge, new sensing mechanisms include disconnection, crack propagation, and tunneling effects leading to drastically resistance change play an important role. A rational choice of materials selection and structure design are required to achieve high sensitivity and stretchability. Lastly, prospects and challenges are discussed for future polymer nanocomposite based wearable strain sensor and their potential applications.

AB Flexible sensing devices have drawn tremendous attention in the past decades due to their potential applications in future hand-held, potable consumer, and wearable electronics. Here, we firstly developed an ultrasensitive wireless potentiometric aptasensor based on flexible freestanding graphene paper for kanamycin detection. Flexible graphene paper made from a simple vacuum filtration method was used as a biocompatible platform for effective immobilization of aptamer. A nuclease-assisted amplification strategy was introduced into this potentiometric biosensing system in order to significantly improve the detection sensitivity through a classic catalytic recycling reaction of target induced by the nuclease (DNase I). As expected, an ultra-low detection limit of 30.0 fg/mL for kanamycin was achieved. Furthermore, the developed potentiometric enzymatic aptasensor exhibits high selectivity, favorable flexibility, excellent stability and reproducibility, which holds great promising for its routine sensing application.

AB In today's development of anticancer drugs, there is an enormous demand for sensitive, non-invasive real-time screening technologies to identify pharmacodynamics/-kinetics of single and combined drugs with high precision. The combination of sophisticated drug sensitivity testing with advanced in vitro tumor models reflecting heterogeneous tumor behavior in vivo is needed to more reasonably predict therapeutic outcome in vivo.
   In this study, the benefits of our real-time, non-invasive multidimensional impedance platform over standard in vitro drug sensitivity assays were demonstrated quantitatively using an advanced melanoma model. Detailed pharmacological profiles of clinically established targeted therapeutics in single and combination treatment have been identified in patient tissue and isolated 2D/3D cell line cultures. Impedance spectroscopy revealed significant differences in tissue structure responsible for BRAF inhibitor pharmacokinetics in BRAF(V600E) tumor microfragments and cell lines. Remarkably, BRAF-/MEK inhibitor combination treatment of direct patient-derived tissue, but not melanoma cell lines, resulted in short-term antagonistic effects consistent with in vivo findings. In contrast, the clinically validated resistance delay and thus long-term synergy of targeted therapeutics in advanced melanoma models has been demonstrated using impedance technology.
   The results demonstrate limited clinical transferability of 2D/3D cancer cell line-based chemosensitivity data and underline the importance of in vivo-like direct patient-derived tissue for predictive drug studies. Our noninvasive and highly sensitive multidimensional impedance platform offers great potential for quantifying short and long-term drug kinetics and synergies to identify the most effective drug combinations in advanced cancer models, thereby improving personalized drug development and treatment planning and ultimately, overall patient outcomes.

AB The detection of life markers is a high priority task in the exploration of the Solar System. Biochips performing in-situ multiplex immunoassays are a very promising approach alternative to gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry. As part of the PLEIADES project, we present the development of a chemiluminescence-based, highly integrated analytical platform for the detection of biomarkers outside of the Earth. The PLEIADES device goes beyond the current lab-on-chip approaches that still require bulky external instrumentation for their operation. It exploits an autonomous capillary force-driven microfluidic network, an array of thin-film hydrogenated amorphous silicon photosensors, and chemiluminescence bioassays to provide highly sensitive analyte detection in a very simple and compact configuration. Adenosine triphosphate was selected as the target life marker. Three bioassay formats have been developed, namely (a) a bioluminescence assay exploiting a luciferase mutant with enhanced thermal and pH stability and (b and c) binding assays exploiting antibodies or functional nucleic acids (aptamers) as biospecific recognition elements and peroxidase or DNAzymes as chemiluminescence reporters. Preliminary results, showing limits of detection in the nanomolar range, confirm the validity of the proposed approach.

AB Tumor markers play an important role in the early diagnosis and therapeutic effect monitoring of tumors. Combined detection of multiple tumor markers is a realistic way of improving the sensitivity and specificity of cancer diagnosis. To achieve this, we studied and designed a giant magneto resistance (GMR) multi-biomarker immunoassay biosensor that can simultaneously detect twelve kinds of tumor markers by integrating a GMR sensor chip, a microfluidic device, a magnetic nano -beads label, and a double antibody sandwich immunoassay method. As a proof of concept, the proposed immunosensor was utilized to detect 12 tumor markers (AFP, CEA, CYFRA21-1, NSE, SCC, PG I, PG II, CA19-9, total PSA, free PSA, free-beta-hCG, Tg) and to screen patients with lung cancer, liver cancer, digestive tract cancer, prostatic cancer, etc. The immunosensor showed excellent sensitivity, accuracy, precision and stability. Designed as a POCT device, the immunosensor also allows for portability, able to perform rapid detection wherever necessary. As a multi-analyte assay, it provides significant advantages over single-analyte tests in terms of cost per test, labor and convenience. The system's ability to simultaneously measure the concentration of multiple markers in serum samples with excellent sensitivity and accuracy allows the immunosensor to be used for early tumor diagnosis.

AB Artificial chemosensory devices have a wide range of applications in industry, security, and medicine. The development of these devices has been inspired by the speed, sensitivity, and selectivity by which the olfactory system in animals can probe the chemical nature of the environment. In this review, we examine how molecular and cellular components of natural olfactory systems have been incorporated into artificial chemosensors, or bioelectronic sensors. We focus on the biological material that has been combined with signal transduction systems to develop artificial chemosensory devices. The strengths and limitations of different biological chemosensory material at the heart of these devices, as well as the reported overall effectiveness of the different bioelectronic sensor designs, is examined. This review also discusses future directions and challenges for continuing to advance development of bioelectronic sensors.

AB Human noroviruses cause acute foodbome gastroenteritis outbreaks worldwide. In this study, a highly sensitive and selective electrochemical biosensor was fabricated for the detection of human norovirus using novel peptides as recognition elements. The electrochemical biosensor was fabricated by assembling of eight novel peptides separately on the gold electrode and investigated their efficiencies for sensing human noroviruses. Among eight peptides, NoroBP peptide coated onto the gold electrode exhibited a high binding affinity towards human noroviruses, resulting a progressive decrease in current signals with increasing concentration of human norovirus (0-10(5) copies/mL). As a result, NoroBP-nonFoul(FlexL)(2)-coated gold electrode acts an efficient electrochemical biosensor for highly selective detection of human norovirus with a detection limit of 1.7 copies/mL, which is 3-fold lower than the reported methods. The developed electrochemical biosensor was successfully applied to detect human norovirus prepared by standard procedure from oyster, which suggests that the developed biosensor can be used as a very sensitive and selective point-of-care bioanalytical platform for the detection of human norovirus in various food samples.

AB Nowadays, monitoring of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) is very important in various domains. In this work, we aimed to develop sensitive olfactory biosensors using odorant binding proteins (OBPs) as sensing materials. Three rat OBP3 derivatives with customized binding properties were designed and immobilized on the same chip for the detection of VOCs in solution by surface plasmon resonance imaging (SPRi). We demonstrated that the proteins kept their binding properties after the immobilization under optimized conditions. The obtained olfactory biosensors exhibited very low limits of detection in both concentration (200 pM of beta-ionone) and in molecular weight of VOCs (100 g/mol for hexanal). Such a performance obtained with SPRi in solution is especially remarkable. We hypothesized that the binding of VOCs to the active sites of OBPs induced a local conformational change in the proteins. This change would give rise to a variation of refractive index, to which SPRi is extremely sensitive. In addition, the olfactory biosensors showed a high selectivity especially at relatively low VOC concentrations. With optimized regeneration procedures, they also showed very good repeatability not only from measurement to measurement but also from chip to chip with a lifespan up to almost two months. These olfactory biosensors are particularly interesting for trace detection of VOCs in solution.

AB Development of new targeted therapies is a challenge in the battle against cancer. Although a variety of treatments is currently available, there is no technique for rapidly evaluating the response of cancer patients to the drug. In this work, a microfluidic platform for the real-time simultaneous analysis of the success rate of different nanoparticle based chemotherapeutic drugs is presented. Based on a previous planar chamber and a reported sensitivity enhancing strategy, linear and cross shape microstructures were integrated into the chamber dome of the microfluidic polydimethylsiloxane and glass platform in order to provide a higher fluid mixing and treatment-cell interaction. Several methotrexate (MTX) based treatments (free MTX, MTX loaded Lecithin-PVA nanoparticles, MTX loaded Lecithin-Tween 80 nanoparticles) as well as their respective controls (cell media and both blank nanoparticles) were recirculated through the microchamber over an osteosarcoma cell monolayer. These nanovehicles reduced cell population to less than 20% (LEC-PVA nanoparticles) and 2.3% (LEC-Tween nanoparticles), demonstrating that nanoparticles are a promising target therapy for cancer treatment. Moreover, microstructured platforms demonstrated a higher efficacy in the drug-screening process: due to the liquid folding a higher amount of nanoparticles was internalized by the cells and, therefore, results were observed faster. In fact, the time required to reduce cell viability to the half was nearly a 75% faster. Furthermore, this microfluidic platform offers the capability to test up to five different drugs simultaneously, making it a powerful tool to evaluate the effect of multiple drugs and determine the most effective and personalized treatment.

AB We report the development of a Lab-on-PCB DNA diagnostic platform, exploiting peptide nucleic acid (PNA) sequences as probes. The study demonstrates the optimization and characterization of two commercial PCB manufacturing gold electroplating processes for biosensing applications. Using an optimized ratio of PNA with a spacer molecule (MCH), the lowest limit of detection (LoD) to date for PCB-based DNA biosensors of 57 fM is reported. The study also showcases a fully integrated Lab-on-PCB microsystem designed for rapid detection, which employs PCB-integrated sample delivery, achieving DNA quantification in the 0.1-100 pM range for 5 mu L samples analyzed within 5 min under continuous flow. The demonstrated biosensor proves the capability of PCB based DNA biosensors for high sensitivity and paves the way for their integration in Lab-on-PCB DNA diagnostic microsystems.

AB Continuous improvements of the fluorescence-based sensitivity and specificity, required for high throughput screening, diagnostics, and molecular biology studies, are usually addressed by better readout systems, or better reporting elements. However, while Fluorescence Interference Contrast (FLIC), which modulates the fluorescence by materials-based parameters, has been used for decades to measure biomolecular interactions at nanometer-precision, e.g., for the study of molecular motors and membrane processes, it has been seldom used for high throughput or diagnostic microdevices. Moreover, the amplification of both the fluorescence signal, modulated by vertically-nano-calibrated structures, and the signal/background, modulated by laterally-micro calibrated structures, has not been explored. To address this synergy, structures comprising optically transparent silicon oxide, tens of micrometers-wide and with thicknesses in the low hundreds of nanometers, which are able to promote the formation of standing waves if patterned on a reflective material, have been designed, fabricated and tested, for the use in DNA- and protein arrays. The light emitted by a fluorophore placed on top of the structures and reflected by a bottom mirror surface, e.g., silicon, platinum, is physically constrained to a region defined lithographically, both vertically and laterally, i.e., micro-pillars and -wells, resulting in an accurate identification and quantification of fluorescence. The signal/noise ratio on micro-/nano-structured substrates is comparable to that measured on planar substrates, but the physical confinement of the microarray spots results in a considerable increase of the intra-feature uniformity.

AB This research aims to engineer molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP)-based synthetic receptors for the molecular recognition of neuron specific enolase (NSE) biomarker. The synthetic peptide derived from the NSE was synthesized along with its cysteine and histidine modified versions. The modified peptides were utilized as templates for molecular imprinting, which was achieved by combination of epitope- and electrochemical surface imprinting strategy. The subsequently generated imprinted cavities were used for the detection of the NSE derived peptide and NSE. The imprints created with cysteine (CME) and histidine modified epitopes (HME) could detect the peptide in a concentration range of 2-128 mu M and 15.6 nM to 128 mu M, respectively. The recognition of NSE was achieved by the same imprints in a linear range of 1-64 ng mL(-1) (CME) and 0.25-64 ng mL(-1) (HME), respectively. The target molecules bound to the control polymer very weakly, confirming the high selectivity of the MIP cavities. Selectivity studies resulted in imprinting factors of 8.8 and 11 for the CME and HME imprints, respectively. The affinity analyses provided dissociation constants of 2.3 x 10(-10) M and 3 x 10(-11) M for NSE recognition using the corresponding epitope imprints. Cross-reactivity studies with non-specific molecules proved high specificity of the artificial receptors for the targets.

AB Whole-cell biosensors present many advantages, including being able to monitor the toxicity and bioavailability of chemicals; cells grown in traditional 2D cultures, however, do not reproduce the complexity of in vivo physiology. In the last years, 3D cell-culture models have garnered great attention due to their capability to better mimic in vivo cellular responses to external stimuli, providing excellent model living organisms. In order to obtain a predictive, sensitive, and robust yet low-cost 3D cell biosensor, we developed a smartphone-based bioluminescent 3D cell biosensor platform for effect-based analysis. We exploited the Nuclear Factor-kappa B (NF-kappa B) signal transduction pathway, which is induced by several types of stressors and is involved in the regulation of cell-cycle/growth, inflammation, apoptosis, and immunity. The smartphone-based biosensor relies on immobilized HEK293 spheroids genetically engineered with powerful red- and green-emitting luciferases utilized as inflammation and viability reporters. It provides a limit of detection for Tumor Necrosis Factor (INF alpha) of 0.15 +/- 0.05 ng/mL and could be a useful tool to initially screen environmental samples or other compounds on-site, especially for additional more accurate chemical analyses.

AB Molecular robot provides a promising way to receive response signals and make decisions with intelligent information processing at the molecule level. In this work, a molecular robot prototype based on a europium(III)-cyclen complex (EuL) was designed and assembled, consisting of multiplex sensing and information processing in a single system. By utilizing the Eu3+ ion as a central processing unit (CPU) and terpyridine (Terpy) group as an arm of the molecular robot, multiplex detection function of this molecular robot can be accomplished in three test channels: the detection of Fe2+ with UV-vis, Zn2+ using photoluminescence, and Mn2+ using magnetic resonance imaging. The optimized structures revealed that the transition metal ions bound by the arms of two EuL molecules formed a hexacoordination octahedral rigidity structure in the adducts. For the structure of L and EuL, three pyridine rings of Terpy unit were not in a plane, and they were fixed to form a plane when captured the transition metal ions during the formation of the adducts. In addition, three different modes of molecular logic devices (OR, INHIBIT, and YES) were established based on relevant signals in the multiplex detection channels. The sensing of metal ions in human urine using EuL was also carried out, and the result demonstrated the presence of good recoveries and high analytical precision. Such a molecular robot prototype is expected to be used in intelligent medical diagnostics and, in particular, information processing at molecular level.

AB An early on-time detection of breast cancer can effectively affect the outcome of the treatment. Here, we developed an ultrasensitive, simple and reliable immunosensor to detect the lowest alteration of CA 15-3, the standard biomarker of breast cancer patients. The proposed immunosensor was achieved by modification of gold electrode by streptavidin to immobilize the biotinylated anti-CA 15-3 monoclonal antibody (mAb). Bovine serum albumin was used to prevent nonspecific binding. To improve the sensitivity of modified immunosensor, the sandwich signal enhancer consisting of streptavidin-coated magnetic beads conjugated with biotinylated horseradish peroxidase (HRP) and anti-CA 15-3 biotinylated mAb was applied. The electrochemical measurements were obtained in the presence of hydroquinone as a redox agent and H2O2 as the activating agent of HRP. Under optimized condition and using square wave voltammetry, the lower limit of quantification was obtained as 15 x 10(-6) U/mL and the linear CA 15-3 concentration range was 50-15 x 10(-6) U/mL. While showing significant stability, the immunosensor displayed an excellent sensitivity and specificity for the detection of CA 15-3 even in the human serum as compared to the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) as a gold standard method. Based on our findings, the engineered immunosensor is proposed as a robust diagnostic tool for the clinical determination of CA 15-3 and other cancer biomarkers.

AB A new method of label free sensing approach with superior selectivity and sensitivity towards virlabel-freeon is presented here, employing the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) behavior of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) and fluorescent CdSeTeS quantum dots (QDs). Inorganic quaternary alloyed CdSeTeS QDs were capped with (L)-cysteine via a ligand exchange reaction. Alternatively, citrate stabilized AuNPs were functionalized with 11-mercaptoundecanoic acid to generate carboxylic group on the gold surface. The carboxylic group on the AuNPs was subjected to bind covalently with the amine group of (L)-cysteine capped CdSeTeS QDs to form CdSeTeS QDs/AuNPs nanocomposites. The fluorescence of CdSeTeS QDs/AuNPs nanocomposite shows quenched spectrum of CdSeTeS QDs at 640 nm due to the close interaction with AuNPs. However, after successive addition of norovirus-like particles (NoV-LPs), steric hindrance-induced LSPR signal from the adjacent AuNPs triggered the fluorescence enhancement of QDs in proportion to the concentration of the target NoV-LPs. A linear range of 10(-14) to 10(-9) g mL(-1) NoV-LPs with a detection limit of 12.1 x 10(-15) g mL(-1) was obtained. This method was further applied on clinically isolated norovirus detection, in the range of 10(2)-10(5) copies mL(-1) with a detection limit of 95.0 copies mL(-1), which is 100-fold higher than commercial ELISA kit. The superiority of the proposed sensor over other conventional sensors is found in its ultrasensitive detectability at low virus concentration even in clinically isolated samples. This proposed detection method can pave an avenue for the development of high performance and robust sensing probes for detection of virus in biomedical applications.

AB In this study, a sensitive aptasensor based on three-dimensional reduced graphene oxide-modified gold nano particles (3D-rGO/AuNPs) was fabricated for the determination of arsenite (As(III)). The 3D-rGO/AuNPs was fully characterized with various techniques. The 5'-thiolate aptamer was first self-assembled on a glassy carbon electrode (GCE) that its modified with 3D-rGO/AuNPs via Au-S covalent bonding. In the presence of As(III), the G-quadruplex interaction was formed between a single-stranded DNA and the target, which produced a hindrance for electron transfer. Consequently, the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy signals of a GCE modified with 3D-rGO/AuNPs was increased. In order to improve the response of the designing aptasensor, the effect of the various parameters was optimized. Under the optimal conditions, the aptasensor has an extraordinarily low detection limit of 1.4 x 10(-7) ng mL(-1) toward As(III) with a dynamic range of 3.8 x 10(-7) - 3.0 x 10(-4) ng mL(-1). The 3D-rGO/AuNPs aptasensor displayed superior selectivity and reproducibility with an acceptable recovery for determination of As(III) in real water samples.

AB It is of the significant importance to achieve facile and on-site detection of heavy metal ions due to the serious harm to environment and human health. Herein, a facile and portable strategy was developed for detection of Hg2+ via portable pressure meter. Biotinylated DNA1 was conjugated on the surface of streptavidin-coated magnetic beads (MBs) to form MBs-DNA1 complex. In the presence of Hg2+, MBs-DNA1 can hybridize with platinum nanoparticles (PtNPs)-functionalized DNA2 (DNA2-PtNPs) via T-Hg2+-T binding. Then, PtNPs effectively catalyzed the decomposition of H2O2 to generate oxygen, leading to an increase in pressure of sealed well of 96-well plate. The gas pressure was linearly related with the concentration of Hg2+ in the range between 10 pM and 100 nM with a detection limit of 2.79 pM, which is more sensitive than most of the previous reports. The specific T-Hg2+-T binding made it easy to selectively detect Hg2+ even when other metal ions co-existed with Hg2+. Therefore, it offers a cost-effective, rapid, facile and portable way to detect Hg2+ by combining gas generation reaction with T-Hg2+-T binding, which holds great potential for detecting Hg2+ in water sample.

AB A high sensitivity photoelectrochemical (PEC) immunosensor for amyloid beta (A beta) detection, which has great neurotoxic effect on the progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD), was presented based on the sensitization of Mn2+ doped CdSe (Mn:CdSe) to Bi2WO6/CdS electrode. Bi2WO6 was synthesized successfully with a unique flower-like amorphous structure, providing a merit to load functional CdS for obtaining an expected PEC response. Mn:CdSe was used to label A beta for acquiring Mn:CdSe-A beta bioconjugate and enhancing the detection sensitivity via the competitive immunoreaction of Mn:CdSe-A beta and A beta with antibody immobilized on Bi2WO6/CdS electrode. The doped of Mn2+ in CdSe nanoparticles could induce energy defect that impeded the recombination of photo-generated charges, and greatly enhanced PEC response for ultrasensitive detection of A beta. The proposed immunosensor for A beta showed a linear range of 0.2 pg mL(-1)-50 ng mL(-1) with a detection limit of 0.068 pg mL(-1), also with good stability, high selectivity, and acceptable reproducibility. The sensitization of Mn:CdSe provided a new way for preparation of highly sensitive protein biosensors.

AB Herein, we report a facile enzyme-free microRNA (miRNA) target-triggered strand displacement reaction (SDR) amplification strategy with ferrocene (Fc) as a signal molecule to fabricate a two-dimensional electroactive molybdenum carbide (Mo2C)-based biosensor. In the presence of miRNA-21, SDR was initiated and many hairpin DNA1 (HDNA1) and hairpin DNA2 (HDNA2) duplexes, which could be captured by probe DNA leading the Fc-modified HDNA2 close to the electrode surface, were produced continuously. MiRNA-21 could be detected by monitoring the redox signal of Fc. The prepared N-carboxymethyl chitosan/Mo2C nanocomposite featured excellent conductivity, great dispersion, and multiple functional groups (amine groups). When the nanocomposite was introduced to a miRNA biosensor electrode interface to ensure its strong connection to the DNA probe, the developed miRNA-21 biosensor demonstrated a reliable linear range of 1.0 fM to 1.0 nM with a detection limit of 0.34 fM and showed good selectivity, reproducibility, and stability. The biosensor was employed to detect miRNA-21 in human serum samples, and it showed great potential in the early clinical diagnosis of various genetic diseases.

AB Human telomerase is responsible for the maintenance of chromosome end structures and is a valuable biomarker for malignant growth. However, the accurate measurement of telomerase activity at the single-cell level has remained a great challenge. Here we develop a simple quantum dot (QD)-based electrochemical biosensor for stripping voltammetric detection of telomerase activity at the single-cell level. We designed a thiol-modified capture DNA which may be immobilized on the gold electrode by the gold-sulfur bond. The presence of telomerase enables the addition of the telomere repeats of (TTAGGG)(n) to the 3' end of the primer, accompanied by the incorporation of abundant biotins in the extension product with the assistance of the biotin-tagged dATP. The subsequent hybridization of extension product with the capture DNA and the addition of streptavidin-coated QDs induce the assembly of large amounts of QDs onto the electrode via specific biotin-streptavidin binding. After the acidic dissolution of QDs, the released Cd (II) can be simply quantified by anodic stripping voltammetry (ASV). Due to the introduction of large amounts of QDs by telomerase-induced primer extension reaction and the synergistic signal amplification induced by the release of Cd (II) from the QDs, this biosensor can detect telomerase activity at the single-cell level without the involvement of any thermal cycling and extra enzymes for signal amplification. Moreover, this assay exhibits a large dynamic range over four orders of magnitude and it is very simple without the involvement of specific hairpin probe design and complicated labelling, holding great potential in point-of-need testing.

AB Detection of the Hepatitis-B surface antigen at the attomolar level is demonstrated using antibody functionalized liquid gated ZnO nanorods field effect transistor (FET) biosensor with vertical electrode configuration. The sensor is operated in heterodyne mode at high frequency to overcome the problem of Debye screening effect in physiological analyte. Enhanced penetration of the electric field lines through the nanorods enables significant improvement in the limit of detection and sensitivity compared to that of the conventional lateral electrode configuration. The combined effect of the probable change in the threshold voltage and the carrier mobility for vertical electrode configuration lead to a sensitivity of around 75% at 1 fM (which is an enhancement by 200%) and a detection limit of 20 aM with a dynamic range from 20 aM to 1 pM. The detection limit which is achieved with the proposed label free sensor in physiological analyte using antibodies is lowered by more than three orders of magnitude compared to the existing reports.

AB In this work, a novel simple and sensitive electrochemical immunosensor was developed based on lactate oxidase as a single electrochemical probe for the detection of carcinoma antigen 125 (CA125). Chitosan-gold nanoparticle/multiwall carbon nanotube/graphene oxide (CS-AuNP/MWCNT/GO) was used as the electrode substrate to increase the electrode specific surface area and improve the protein immobilization and the electrochemical performance of the electrode in terms of oxidation of H2O2. Due to the peroxidase-like function of CS-AuNP, the oxidation peak of H2O2 was observed at a very low potential (0.034 V). The lactate oxidase is used, for the first time, as the single-enzyme label in a sandwich type immunosensor. In the optimum condition, the designed immunosensor exhibited two linear ranges (0.01-0.5 U/mL and 0.5-100 U/mL) by chronoamperometry (CHA). The limit of detection (LOD) was estimated to be 0.002 U/mL. The immunosensor displayed excellent reproducibility and stability with remarkable selectivity in terms of the detection of CA125 even in the human serum samples as compared to the ELISA. In conclusion, the engineered immunosensor is proposed as an ultra-sensitive tool for the detection and monitoring of CA125 in the human serum.

AB Theoretical and in vivo neuroscience research suggests that functional information transfer within neuronal networks is influenced by circuit architecture. Due to the dynamic complexities of the brain, it remains a challenge to test the correlation between structure and function of a defined network. Engineering controlled neuronal networks in vitro offers a way to test structural motifs; however, no method has achieved small, multi-node networks with stable, unidirectional connections. Here, we screened ten different microchannel architectures within polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) devices to test their potential for axonal guidance. The most successful design had a 92% probability of achieving strictly unidirectional connections between nodes. Networks built from this design were cultured on multielectrode arrays and recorded on days in vitro 9, 12, 15 and 18 to investigate spontaneous and evoked bursting activity. Transfer entropy between subsequent nodes showed up to 100 times more directional flow of information compared to the control. Additionally, directed networks produced a greater amount of information flow, reinforcing the importance of directional connections in the brain being critical for reliable communication. By controlling the parameters of network formation, we minimized response variability and achieved functional, directional networks. The technique provides us with a tool to probe the spatio-temporal effects of different network motifs.

AB The successful development of selective detection of cancer cells from normal cells is a highly demanded but challenging task. Herein, we have developed a rapid and label-free impedimetric biosensor for quantitative determination of cancer cells with high glycoprotein expression. Homogenously distributed 2-9 nm graphene quantum dots (GQDs) was anchored on the surface Fe3O4 through covalent bonding. Concovalin A (ConA) was then adhered onto GQDs by physical mixing to fabricate ConA-GQD@Fe3O4 nanosensing probe. A good dynamic range in the cell concentration of 5 x 10(2)-1 x 105 cells mL(-1) with LOD values of 246 and 367 cells mL(-1) for HeLa and MCF-7, respectively, is obtained. The impedimetric responses to the cancerous HeLa and MCF-7 cells are 16.7 and 13.1 times higher than those of their original sensor electrodes. However, the interaction between sensing probe and normal MCF-10 and bEnd.3 cells is negligible, confirming the specific selectivity toward cancer cells. Cellular uptake images as well as in-vitro cytotoxicity corroborates the electrochemical results. In addition, the successful detection of cancer cells in human serum and circulating tumor cells in blood sample envisions the feasibility of using ConA-GQD@Fe3O4 as the nanosensing probe for clinically early diagnosis of cancer cells with high glycoprotein expression.

AB As cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are responsible for millions of deaths annually, there is a need for rapid and sensitive diagnosis of CVD at earlier stages. Aptamers generated by systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (SELEX) processes have been shown to be superior to conventional antibody-based cardiac biomarker detection. However, SELEX is a complicated, lengthy procedure requiring multiple rounds of extraction/amplification and well-trained personnel. To circumvent such issue, we designed an automated, miniaturized SELEX platform for the screening of aptamers towards three protein biomarkers associated with CVDs: N-terminal pro-peptide of B-type natriuretic peptide, human cardiac troponin I, and fibrinogen. The developed microfluidic platform was equipped with microfluidic devices capable of sample transport and mixing along with an on-chip nucleic acid amplification module such that the entire screening process (5 rounds of selection in 8 h.) could be performed consecutively on a single chip while consuming only 35 mu L of reagents in each cycle. This system may therefore serve as a promising, sensitive, cost-effective platform for the selection of aptamers specific for CVD biomarkers.

AB A Fe-N-C catalyst is supposed to drive commercialization of microbial fuel cells (MFCs) because of its remarkable catalytic performance on oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). However, the catalyst suffers from unclear active site structure and unknown responses of the cathodic microbial community. Here, we prepared a mesoporous core-shell structure catalyst with a nitrogen doped matrix carbon shell, and a Fe3O4 core (Fe3O4@N-mC) as efficient cathode catalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). The resulting hybrid electrocatalyst (Fe3O4@N-mC) showed higher limiting current density (2.94 mA cm(-2)), lower H2O2 yield (7.2-12.7%), and a higher electron transfer number (3.74-3.85) for ORR activity than its intermediates, including Fe3O4, polyaniline (PANI), nitrogen doped carbon (N-C), and magnetic polyaniline composite (Fe3O4@PANI). In MFC tests, Fe3O4@N-mC produced a power density of 0.73 W m(-2), which was 2.14 times of N-C (0.34 W m(-2)), 3.84 times of Fe3O4@ PANI (0.19 W m(-2)), and more than four times of Fe3O4 (4.29, 0.17 W m(-2)) and PANI (4.87, 0.15 W m(-2)). Illumina sequencing of 16S rRNA gene amplicons and non-metric multi-dimensional scaling (NMDS) indicated distinct separation of the cathode biofilm bacterial communities between MFCs with different cathodic catalysts. MFCs with the Fe3O4@N-mC cathode facilitated the enrichment of putative exoelectrogenic Dietzia. Our findings suggest that enhancing ORR performance of Fe3O4@N-mC in MFCs can be attributed to the co-effects of Fe and N, the core-mesoporous shell structure, and various nitrogen functionalities.

AB We report a novel aptamer functionalized MoS2-rGO based electrochemical method for Vi polysaccharide antigen mediated detection of enteric fever. Herein, highly selective anti-Vi aptamers were screened from a pool of oligonucleotides using a microtitre based SELEX approach and characterized for its specificity and stability. The MoS2-rGO nanocomposite was synthesized using a liquid assisted exfoliation by taking optimum ratio of MoS2 and rGO. The nanocomposite presented synergistic effect owing to easy biomolecular functionalization and enhanced conductivity. The screened anti-Vi aptamers were embedded on the MoS2-rGO nanocomposite via thiol linkage to give a stable biointerface. The developed aptasensor was characterized and further evaluated for its performance with different concentrations of Vi antigen using ferrocene labeled boronic acid as an electroactive probe. The aptasensor responded linearly in the range between 0.1 ng mL I to 1000 ng mL(-1) with a detection limit of 100 pg mL(-1), and did not show any cross-reactivity with other bacterial polysaccharides indicating high specificity. The applicability of the developed aptasensor was further validated in urine and sera specimens spiked with Vi antigen.

AB The successful interfacing of electronics with biology is the next frontier for microelectronics and nano technology. Melanin, a naturally occurring conjugated polymer composed of different structural subunits, may be an ideal candidate for such interfacing. In the solid-state, the large broadband molar attenuation coefficient of melanin over the visible spectrum implicates potential applications as a semiconductor for light harvesting and light detection. Additionally, the conductance of melanin has been shown to increase with hydration, making this irregular polymer a hybrid electronic-protonic conductor. While the precise mechanism of charge transfer in melanin is not well understood, the hydration dependence of conductance has been tapped to utilize melanin based devices in a variety of roles, such as humidity sensors and pH detectors. The applications of melanin active layers in OLEDs, OPVs and OFETs have been explored. The viability of this polymer has also been validated inside biological systems, showing the potential for creating electronic devices that are biocompatible. This paper reviews the status of melanin towards achieving biocompatible electronics.

AB An improved amperometric sarcosine biosensor was constructed based on covalent immobilization of sarcosine oxidase nanoparticles (SOxNPs) onto gold electrode (AuE). The SOxNPs/AuE was characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) at different stages of its construction. The biosensor worked optimally within 2 s at a potential of 1.0 V, against Ag/AgCl, pH 6.5 and 35 degrees C. A linear relationship was observed between sarcosine concentration range, 0.1-100 mu M and the biosensor response i.e. current in mA under optimum conditions. The biosensor offered a low detection limit of 0.01 mu M and gratifying storage stability. The SOxNPs/AuE was unaffected by a number of serum substances at their physiological concentrations. The biosensor measured sarcosine level in sera collected from persons suffering from prostate cancer (mean13.5 mu M, n = 8), which was significantly higher (p < 0.01) than those in apparently healthy persons (mean 2.2 mu M, n = 8). The SOxNPs/Au electrode was reused 300-times during the span of 180 days, with only 10% loss in its initial activity while being stored dry at 4 degrees C.

AB Atomic layer deposition (ALD) is a thin film deposition technique currently used in various nanofabrication processes for microelectronic applications. The ability to coat high aspect ratio structures with a wide range of materials, the excellent conformality, and the exquisite thickness control have made ALD an essential tool for the fabrication of many devices, including biosensors. This mini-review aims to provide a summary of the different ways ALD has been used to prepare biosensor devices. The materials that have been deposited by ALD, the use of the ALD layers prepared and the different types of biosensors fabricated are presented. A selected list of studies will be used to illustrate how the ALD route can be implemented to improve the operational performance of biosensors. This work comprehensively shows the benefits of ALD and its application in various facets of biosensing and will help in exploiting the numerous prospects of this emerging and growing field.

AB A diclofenac (DCF)-imprinted polymer, composed of polyaniline, reduced graphene oxide (rGO) and triphenylamine, as cross linker, was synthetized. This composite was identified by using SEM and FT-IR techniques. The prepared DCF-imprinted polymer (MIP) was used for modification of carbon paste electrodes (CPEs) to fabricate a selective DCF electrochemical sensor. Electrochemical behavior of DCF on the investigated sensor and the optimization of the parameters affecting the DCF determination were screened by cyclic voltammetry (CV). The cyclic voltammogram of DCF showed an anodic peak current at about 0.5 V (vs. SCE). The calibration curve for DCF determination was obtained by applying the investigated sensor as working electrode in differential pulse voltammetry (DPV). A linear increase in the anodic peak current was observed in the range 5-80 mg L-1 of DCF. The corresponding limit of detection was calculated to be 1.1 mg L-1. The relative standard deviations of the inter- and infra-day analysis of DCF presented by the method were found to be as 2.43% and 2.47%, respectively. The selectivity of the investigated sensor was evaluated by its use for determination of DCF in the binary solutions containing DCF/glucose, DCF/urea and DCF/ascorbic acid. It was shown that the fabricated electrode can be successfully used for analysis of DCF in pharmaceutical and urine samples.

AB We develop for the first time a new electrochemical biosensor for signal-on detection of T4 polynucleotide kinase (PNK) based on the enhanced quasi-reversible redox signal of prussian blue generated by self-sacrificial label of iron metal-organic framework (FeMOF). The DNA hairpin probe modified with FeMOF@AuNPs at the 3'-thiol end acts as the substrate of PNK. The presence of PNK enables the 5'-phosphorylation of hairpin probe, which may subsequently function as the substrate of lambda exonuclease. Lambda exonuclease removes the 5' mononucleotides from the stem, unfolding the hairpin structure and releasing the single-stranded DNA (ssDNA). The resultant FeMOF@AuNP-modified ssDNA may specifically hybridize with the capture probe to form the double-strand DNA (dsDNA) duplex, enabling the immobilization of FeMOF on the electrode surface. The reaction of Fe3+ in the MOF with K4Fe(CN)(6) leads to the formation of prussian blue on the electrode surface and consequently the generation of a high electrochemical signal. This assay is very simple without the involvement of the pre-synthesized prussian blue which is unstable in neutral buffer, and the self-sacrificial label of FeMOF can achieve great signal amplification without the involvement of any extra functional materials. Due to the introduction of self-sacrificial label of FeMOF and the formation of prussian blue nanolayers with good quasi reversible cyclic voltammetric electrochemical activity, this biosensor exhibits high sensitivity and a large dynamic range. Moreover, this biosensor can be used to screen the PNK inhibitors, holding great potential in disease diagnosis and drug discovery.

AB The simple, rapid, sensitive, and specific detection of cancer cells plays a pivotal role in the diagnosis and prognosis of cancer. We developed a novel DNA-labeled sandwich electrochemical biosensor based on a glassy carbon electrode modified with 3D graphene and a hybrid of Au nanocages (Au NCs)/amino-functionalized multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT-NH2) for label-free and selective detection of MCF-7 breast cancer cells via differential pulse voltammetry. The layer-by-layer assembly and cell-detection performance of the Au NCs/MWCNTs-NH2-based biosensor were investigated using scanning electron microscopy and electrochemical methods including cyclic voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. Owing to the advantages of DNA-labeled antibodies and a nanomaterial-based signal amplification strategy, the fabricated cytosensor exhibited high specificity and sensitivity when detecting MCF-7 cells in the range of 1.0 x 10(2) to 1.0 x 10(6) cells mL(-1) with a low detection limit of 80 cells mL(-1) (3 sigma/slope). Furthermore, the biosensor exhibited high selectivity when detecting MCF-7 cells and showed considerable potential for practical applications. The proposed DNA-labeled sandwich electrochemical biosensor provides a stable, sensitive approach to detecting cancer cells and is promising in terms of potential applications to cancer diagnosis.

AB Colloidal metal nanoparticles (NPs) with remarkable localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) have found wide use as probes in sensing. The LSPR that employed as the sensing signal is strongly associated with the morphology of nanoprobes. In this work, morphological change of Au nanocage to Au@Ag nanobox and thus the LSPR evolution are well regulated by trace amount of antioxidant, where the mechanism of seed-mediated growth is used as a powerful means in this process. Based on the linear relationship between morphology induced LSPR evolution and the concentration of antioxidant, a simple, reliable and highly sensitive colorimetric method is developed for antioxidant detection. The detectable range of this method is 0.01-5 mu M and 2-20 mu M when a UV-vis spectrophotometer and a smartphone are employed as an analyzer, respectively. It has also been successfully applied in the detection of total antioxidants in green tea. This work provides new insights into developing sensitive LSPR-based sensors through precisely manipulating the morphology of nanoprobes.

AB A simple and sensitive turn-off electrogenerated chemiluminescence (ECL) biosensor was designed for the analysis of histone acetyltransferases (HATs) activity and inhibitor evaluation based on the anti-hydrolysis ability of acetylated peptide and mimetic superoxide dismutase (SOD) features of tannic acid (TA) assembled gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) nanoprobes. In this strategy, after the acetylated reaction in the presence of HATs, the acetylated peptide on electrode was resistance to the hydrolysis of trypsin, and can absorb AuNPs@TA-Fe probe onto the electrode by the hydrophobic interaction and hydrogen bonding interaction. Thus, the ECL signal of the modified electrode in luminol solution decreased significantly owing to the mimetic SOD features of the TA assembled nanoprobe that can eliminate the reactive oxygen species. The ECL intensity changes can be utilized for sensitive HATs activities detection and inhibitor screening. The detection limit of the as-prepared ECL biosensor was 0.074 nM (S/N = 3). Moreover, the as designed ECL biosensor was also applied in MCF-7 cell lysates for HATs activity analysis and drug inhibition, which is feasible to HATs activity analysis and inhibitor screening, and presents highly promise in HAT-related clinical diagnostics.

AB Exosomes as cell-derived vesicles have the potential to be novel biomarkers for noninvasive diagnosis of cancers. However, cost-effective detection of exosomes in routine clinical settings is still challenging. Herein, we present a ZnO nanowires coated three-dimensional (3D) scaffold chip device for effective immunocapture and classically visible and colorimetric detection of exosomes. The chip device is composed of 3D polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) scaffold skeleton covered by free-standing ZnO nanowire array. The interconnected micropores of 3D scaffold induces the fluid flow with chaotic or vortex feature, and ZnO nanowire array provides large surface area for immobilization of exosome specific antibody as well as size exclusion-like effect for retaining exosomes. These synergistically and significantly enhance the capture of exosomes at a high flow rate. The captured exosomes are detected by horseradish peroxidase (HRP) labeled antibody which can initiate 3,3',5,5'-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB)-based colorimetric sensing. The quantitative readout of exosomes is easily accomplished by UV-vis spectrometry or microplate reader with a linear range of 2.2 x 10(5) to 2.4 x 10(7) particles/mu L and a minimal detectable concentration of 2.2 x 10(4) particles/mu L. This chip device was applicable to clinical samples where cancer patients demonstrate statistically significant increase in exosomes compared with healthy individuals. Thus, our chip device is cost-effective and easy-to-use, facilitating visible and colorimetric assay with high sensitivity toward clinical applications.

AB Microbial fuel cells (MFCs) are a promising clean energy source to directly convert waste chemicals to available electric power. However, the practical application of MFCs needs the increased power density, enhanced energy conversion efficiency and reduced electrode material cost. In this study, three-dimensional (3D) macroporous N, P and S co-doped carbon foams (NPS-CFs) were prepared by direct pyrolysis of the commercial bread and employed as free-standing anodes in MFCs. As-obtained NPS-CFs have a large specific surface area (295.07 m(2) g(-1)), high N, P and S doping level, and excellent electrical conductivity. A maximum areal power density of 3134 mW m(-2) and current density of 7.56 A m(-2) are generated by the MFCs equipped with as-obtained NPS-CF anodes, which is 2.57- and 2.63-fold that of the plain carbon cloth anodes (areal power density of 1218 mW m(-2) and current density of 2.87 A m(-2)), respectively. Such improvement is explored to mainly originate from two respects: the good biocompatibility of NPS-CFs favors the bacterial adhesion and enrichment of electroactive Geobacter species on the electrode surface, while the high conductivity and improved bacteria-electrode interaction efficiently promote the extracellular electron transfer (EET) between the bacteria and the anode. This study provides a low-cost and sustainable way to fabricate high power MFCs for practical applications.

AB A versatile label-free electrochemical biosensor based on dual enzyme assisted multiple amplification strategy was developed for ultrasensitive detection of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA). The biosensor consists of a triple helix molecular switch (THMS) as molecular recognition and signal transduction probe, ribonuclease HII (RNase HII) and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) as dual enzyme assisted multiple amplification accelerator. The presence of target ctDNA could open THMS and trigger RNase HII-assisted homogenous target recycling amplification to produce substantial signal transduction probe (STP). The released STP hybridized with the capture probe immobilized on a gold electrode, then TdT and assistant probe were further employed to fulfill TdT-mediated cascade extension and generate stable DNA dendritic nanostructures. The electroactive methyl blue (MB) was finally used as the signal reporter to realize the multiple electrochemical amplification ctDNA detection as the amount of MB is positively correlated with the target ctDNA. Combined with the efficient recognition capacity of the designed THMS and the excellent multiple amplification ability of RNase HII and TdT, the constructed sensing platform could detect KRAS G12DM with a wide detection range from 0.01 fM to 1 pM, and the limit of detection as low as 2.4 aM. Besides, the platform is capable of detecting ctDNA in biological fluid such as plasma. More importantly, by substituting the loop of THMS with different sequences, this strategy could be conveniently expanded into the detection of other ctDNA, showing promising potential applications in clinical cancer screening and prognosis.

AB The quantitative detection of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) is significant to assess tumor status and therapeutic efficiency. In this study, a sandwich-type amperometric immunosensor for CEA detection sensitively was fabricated by novel signal amplification system. The signal amplification system was formed by gold nano particles loaded on amino functionalized graphene sheet (Au NPs/NH2-GS) and gold@palladium nanodendrites loaded on ferrous-chitosan functionalized polypyrrole nanotubes (Au@Pd NDs/Fe2+-CS/PPy NTs). Au NPs/NH2-GS as platform enhanced the electron transfer proven by apparent electron transfer rate constant. Au@Pd NDs/Fe2+-CS/PPy NTs nanocomposite as label appeared high catalytic activity to hydrogen peroxide reduction. Thus, the immunosensor showed wide linear concentration range (50 fg/mL to 50 ng/mL) and low detection limit of 17 fg/mL via amperometric i-t curve (i-t). Significantly, the nanocomposite can act as electroactive substance, which provided a good method to detect CEA without additional electroactive substance via square wave voltammetry (SWV). An overlapping linear concentration range (500 fg/mL to 5.0 ng/mL) was obtained compared i-t with SWV.
   The good reliability was verified mutually by i-t and SWV in actual sample analysis under overlapping linear concentration range. The detection method of without additional electroactive substance has vast potential for future development, due to simple testing condition.

AB Biosensing and detecting the rare circulating tumor cells (CTCs) in complex blood samples are a great challenge but necessary for cancer metastasis prevention. Here we show a novel highly-sensitive biosensing system for detecting CTCs in whole blood. The system is composed of Her2-coated immunomagnetic beads and an anti-EpCAM aptamer assembled pseudo-DNA nanocatenane (PDN) for dual targeting and separating CTCs, in conjunction with the rolling circle amplification (RCA) and molecular beacon (MB) system for CTCs signal amplification. The Her-2-coated beads separated CTCs from blood after their elution from a magnetic column. The unique PDN, which is a tailor-designed self-assembly of three circular DNAs that are inter-locked with independent and non-interfered templates for periodic RCA process, binds EpCAM-rich CTCs. In the presence of the RCA primer, phi29 DNA polymerase and MB, the system collaboratively generated the amplified fluorescent signals for highly-sensitive detection of CTCs. Through this system, we achieved the limit of detection less than 10 CTCs/mL blood, and quantified the number of CTCs in patient blood, which is proportional to the patient cancer status. Our technique is highly-sensitive, practicable and convenient enough for clinical detection of breast CTCs.

AB Detection of telomerase activity is crucial for the telomerase-related early diagnosis of cancer and drug screening. Herein, a multicolor visual telomerase detection method with high sensitivity was developed based on the etching of hexadecyl trimethyl ammonium bromide-stablized Au nanorods (Au NRs) by the oxidation state 3,3',5,5'-tetramethylbenzidine sulfate (TMB2+). In order to meet the demand of bare-eye inspection, an enzyme free signal amplification strategy of catalytic hairpin assembly (CHA) was incorporated. After the introduction of telomerase, telomerase extension products specifically triggered cyclic CHA and led to the successive formation of G-quadruplex/hemin DNAzyme, which catalyzed the H2O2-mediated oxidation of TMB. The Au NRs were gradually etched as the concentration of catalysate TMB2+ increased, resulting in the decrease of aspect ratio of the Au NRs. Correspondingly, the longitudinal localized surface plasmon resonance peak of Au NRs was blue shifted, with the concomitant generation of a series of color transition. Under optimal conditions, a highly sensitive detection toward telomerase was realized down to 15 HeLa cells. Compared to previous colorimetric method for telomerase determination, multiple colors corresponding to telomerase activity was the most attractive virtue of our approach. More strikingly, telomerase-induced cyclic CHA significantly enhanced the accumulation of G-quadruplex/hemin DNAzyme, thus the signal amplification was effectively realized. Our approach exhibited excellent sensitivity and convenient signal readout, which is expected to provide great potential application in cancer diagnosis and therapy.

AB An aptamer with the length of only 15 nucleotides specific for tobramycin was obtained through rationally designed truncation from a previously reported long sequence. The structural and binding properties of the aptamer were characterized. The dissociation constant (K-d) was determined to be 42.12 nM, indicating high affinity of the aptamer for tobramycin. Then an electrochemical sensor based on this aptamer was developed, which employed an enzymes-assisted dual signal amplification cycle through target recycling and strand-displacement DNA polymerization. A hairpin probe containing the aptamer sequence was designed and used to start the production cycle of a short ssDNA fragment in the presence of tobramycin, with the help of phi29 DNA polymerase and nicking endonuclease Nt.AlwI. The ssDNA fragment was captured by a signal transduction probe modified on gold electrode to form a triple-helix structure. With the help of [Ru(NH3)(6)](3+), a significant electrochemical signal was observed in differential pulse voltammetry (DPV). Under the optimal conditions, the current in DPV is linearly related with the concentration of tobramycin in the range of 10-200 nM, and the detection limit is 5.13 nM. The electrochemical sensor showed high specificity for tobramycin when it was challenged by other antibiotics. In addition, the constructed sensor was used to detect tobramycin in milk and water samples, and showed satisfactory performance. Therefore, the screened aptamer as well as the developed sensor has great application prospects in the fields of food safety control, medical test and environment monitoring.

AB Antibiotics are a type of antimicrobial drug with the ubiquitous presence in foodstuff that effectively applied to treat the diseases and promote the animal growth worldwide. Chloramphenicol as one of the antibiotics with the broad action spectrum against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria is widely applied for the effective treatment of infectious diseases in humans and animals. Unfortunately, the serious side effects of chloramphenicol, such as aplastic anemia, kidney damage, nausea, and diarrhea restrict its application in foodstuff and biomedical fields. Development of the sufficiently sensitive methods to detect chloramphenicol residues in food and clinical diagnosis seems to be an essential demand. Biosensors have been introduced as the promising tools to overcome the requirement. As one of the newest types of the biosensors, aptamer-based biosensors (aptasensors) are the efficient sensing platforms for the chloramphenicol monitoring. In the present review, we summarize the recent achievements of the accessible aptasensors for qualitative detection and quantitative determination of chloramphenicol as a candidate of the antibiotics. The present chloramphenicol aptasensors can be classified in two main optical and electrochemical categories. Also, the other formats of the aptasensing assays like the high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and microchip electrophoresis (MCE) have been reviewed. The enormous interest in utilizing the diverse nanomaterials is also highlighted in the fabrication of the chloramphenicol aptasensors. Finally, some results are presented based on the advantages and disadvantages of the studied aptasensors to achieve a promising perspective for designing the novel antibiotics test kits.

AB A glucose/oxygen biofuel cell (BFC) that can operate continuously under oxygen-free conditions is described. The oxygen-deficit limitations of metabolite/oxygen enzymatic BFCs have been addressed by using an oxygen rich cathode binder material, polychlorotrifluoroethylene (PCTFE), which provides an internal oxygen supply for the BFC reduction reaction. This oxygen-rich cathode component mitigates the potential power loss in oxygen free medium or during external oxygen fluctuations through internal supply of oxygen, while the bioanode employs glucose oxidase-mediated reactions. The internal oxygen supply leads to a prolonged energy-harvesting in oxygen-free solutions, e.g., maintaining over 90% and 70% of its initial power during 10- and 24-h operations, respectively, in the absence of oxygen. The new strategy holds considerable promise for energy-harvesting and self-powered biosensing applications in oxygen-deficient conditions.

AB Ideal monitoring devices should enjoy a combination of characteristics, e.g. high sensitivity, multiplexing, portability, short time-to-result (Tilt). Typically, no device meets all of these demands since some of them are contradictory, to some extent. Herein, we present a miniaturized platform based on fluorescent detection, which is sensitive, readily allows multiplexing, and allows real-time monitoring of the signal, thus allowing extraction of kinetic information as well as drastic reduction of TTR. This is achieved via miniaturization of active spots, integration with microfluidics, and algorithmic approaches. We validate its performance by comparing with evanescent field excitation, which obtains similar results, however without the addition of the necessary complex hardware.

AB Metabolites, the small molecules that underpin life, can act as indicators of the physiological state of the body when their abundance varies, offering routes to diagnosis of many diseases. The ability to assay for multiple metabolites simultaneously will underpin a new generation of precision diagnostic tools. Here, we report the development of a handheld device based on complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) technology with multiple isolated micro-well reaction zones and integrated optical sensing allowing simultaneous enzyme-based assays of multiple metabolites (choline, xanthine, sarcosine and cholesterol) associated with multiple diseases. These metabolites were measured in clinically relevant concentration range with minimum concentrations measured: 25 mu M for choline, 100 mu M for xanthine, 1.25 mu M for sarcosine and 50 mu M for cholesterol. Linking the device to an Android-based user interface allows for quantification of metabolites in serum and urine within 2 min of applying samples to the device. The quantitative performance of the device was validated by comparison to accredited tests for cholesterol and glucose.

AB We have developed a quantum dot aptasensor (QD-aptasensor) and its accompanying portable analyzer for the detection of di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP). This sensor is based on a newly screened aptamer (60-mer) via SELEX and shows a binding affinity of 213 nmol/L with DEHP. The 60-mer aptamer together with its three shorter truncated aptamers (45, 28, and 22-mer) as well as three different DNA probes (12, 9, and 13-mer) were further investigated to form the best combination for the QD-aptasensor. Using a 22-mer-truncated aptamer and a 12-mer DNA probe combination, the QD-aptasensor demonstrated excellent DEHP sensitivity with an LOQ = 0.5 pg/mL as well as good selectivity in the presence of other phthalate analogs. The binding between the truncated aptamers and DEHP was also characterized. Finally, a QD-aptasensor-based portable analyzer was also developed, and its equivalence to the laboratory protocol was established with a correlation coefficient r = 0.86 for DEHP concentrations ranging from 0.0005 to 100 ng/mL.

AB Enrichment and detection of rare cells are essential in many biological and medical applications. In this study, circulating tumor cells were detected by combining dielectrophoretic (DEP) manipulation and impedance measurement using circular microelectrodes within a single microfluidic device. A prototype of the device was fabricated through standard soft-lithography. With the proposed microchip, target cells (lung cancer cells, A549) were guided toward the center of the working region due to the action of positive DEP and hydrodynamic drag forces and were then trapped onto the desired sensing electrodes. Impedance was measured to identify the presence of cells. Impedance spectroscopy was conducted at different numbers of cells. Linear characteristics were found using differential analysis technique. Experimental results showed that the impedance sensor can detect A549 cell line with low cell number at the appropriate frequencies. Limit of detection (LOD) of approximately 3 cells was achieved at frequencies near 50 kHz. This simple, rapid, label-free, and low-cost approach may open up new opportunities for developing cell diagnosis systems for future applications.

AB This work reports a facile and sensitive self-powered cathodic photoelectrochemical (PEC) aptasensor for the detection of oxytetracycline (OTC) based on Au nanoparticles-decorated phosphorus-doped porous ultrathin g-C3N4 nanosheets (Au/PCN-S). The prepared PCN-S possesses large specific surface area with abundant in-plane pores on its surface, ideal biocompatibility, and excellent visible light response. The in situ photo-reduced Au nanoparticles further enhanced the PEC performance owing to its unique surface plasmon resonance (SPR) effect. Under visible light irradiation, the photocurrent of Au/PCN-S composites was significantly enhanced, which was about 22 times higher than that of pure g-C3N4. In the self-powered PEC biosensing of OTC, the device exhibited high sensitivity toward the presence of dissolved oxygen in the electrolyte and presented a wide detection range from 0.5 to 200 nM and a detection limit of 0.34 nM, as well as certain selectivity, reproducibility and stability.

AB A novel portable fiber optical chemiluminescent biosensor (FOCB) system was successfully constructed using fiber optic bio-probe as biorecognition element as well as transducer and a Si-based photodiode detector (PD-3000). The compact design of FOCB with free magnetic beads and photomultiplier allows it to be portable and suitable for on-site and automatic detection of targets, as well as to be cost-effective and small sample volume (only 40.0 mu L). The sensitivity of 5 fW could be obtained for the FOCB due to the high performance of PD-3000 and no background light signal. Next, the FOCB was applied for the CL-based detection of microcystin-LR (MC-LR) in water using hapten-carrier protein conjugates modified fiber optic bio-probe as biorecognition element. Based on indirect competitive sandwich-like CL immunoassay principle, the highly sensitive detection of MC-LR was achieved using FOCB system. Under optimal conditions, the limit of detection for MC-LR is 0.03 mu g/L, which is comparable with that of most reported MC-LR immunoassay methods. The robustness of the hapten carrier protein-modified biosensor surface allowed multiple MC-LR immunoassays without any significant loss of performance, which ensured accurate and cost-effective detection results. The proposed strategy demonstrated good recovery, precision, and accuracy through the evaluation of the spiked water samples. The FOCB system can be readily extended toward the on-site real-time sensitive detection of other targets in the field of environment, food, and medical diagnosis.

AB A force sensor concept is presented where fluorescence signal is converted into force information via single molecule Forster resonance energy transfer (smFRET). The basic design of the sensor is a similar to 100 base pair (bp) long double stranded DNA (dsDNA) that is restricted to a looped conformation by a nucleic acid secondary structure (NAS) that bridges its ends. The looped dsDNA generates a tension across the NAS and unfolds it when the tension is high enough. The FRET efficiency between donor and acceptor (D&A) fluorophores placed across the NAS reports on its folding state. Three dsDNA constructs with different lengths were bridged by a DNA hairpin and KCl was titrated to change the applied force. After these proof-of-principle measurements, one of the dsDNA constructs was used to maintain the G-quadruplex (GQ) construct formed by thrombin binding aptamer (TBA) under tension while it interacted with a destabilizing protein and stabilizing small molecule. The force required to unfold TBA-GQ was independently investigated with high-resolution optical tweezers (OT) measurements that established the relevant force to be a few pN, which is consistent with the force generated by the looped dsDNA. The proposed method is particularly promising as it enables studying NAS, protein, and small molecule interactions using a highly-parallel FRET-based assay while the NAS is kept under an approximately constant force.

AB Prostate specific antigen (PSA) is a widely used marker for the diagnosis of prostate cancer, and the increasing attention has been attracted on the development of rapid assay using biosensing technology. However, it remains challenging for the sensitive and selective detection of PSA in clinical samples. Here, we report a label-free microfluidic paper-based analytical device for highly sensitive electrochemical detection of PSA. The paper device was fabricated with wax printing to generate hydrophobic and hydrophilic layers for the construction of microfluidic channel, followed by screen-printing of three electrodes including working, counter and reference electrode. Gold nanoparticles (AuNPs)/reduced graphene oxide (rGO)/thionine (THI) nano composites were synthesized and characterized, which were coated onto working electrodes for the immobilization of DNA aptamer probe. THI servers as the electrochemical mediator to transduce the biological recognition between DNA aptamer and PSA, and the excellent conductivity of AuNPs and rGO also play a significant role of electron transfer, leading to a sensitive detection for PSA, able to detect PSA as low as 10 pg mL(-1), with a linear range from 0.05 to 200 ng mL(-1). We demonstrated that our electrochemical sensor for the detection of clinical serum samples, indicating that our sensor would provide a new platform for low cost, sensitive and point-of-care diagnosis of prostate cancer.

AB Sensitive and specific detection of DNA methylation in genomic DNA is imperative for rapid epigenetic evaluations. Here, a novel sensitive electrochemical strategy was developed for ultrasensitive detection of DNA methylation in genomic DNA via padlock probe primer generating rolling circle amplification (RCA). Typically, after bisulfite treatment of methylated DNA, the methylation-specific linear padlock is only circularized in the presence of methylated DNA and subsequently serves as a template containing a DNA tetrahedron for RCA. The DNA tetrahedron is utilized as a nanocarrier that can be immobilized on a gold electrode to generate RCA product to load hemin, an iron-containing porphyrin with chlorine, forming the G-quadruplex as a horseradish peroxidase like DNAzyme, which reduces methylene blue (MB) in the presence of H2O2 to yield a distinct current signal. Using the developed DNAzyme with the RCA signal amplification strategy, the DNA biosensor can achieve a detection limit as low as 0.1 fM for the ultrasensitive electrochemical detection of methylated DNA sequence with a detection range from 10(-15) M to 10(-9) M. At the same time, the satisfactory specificity, reproducibility, stability and recovery performances indicated its satisfied potentials for clinical diagnosis. Most importantly, this method can be further applied to analyse other genomic DNA also.

AB The detection of Hg2+ in biological systems and its imaging is of highly importance. In this work, a novel ratiometric fluorescence probe is developed based on through-bond energy transfer (TBET) with a 2-(2-hydroxyphenyl)benzoxazole (HBO) as donor and a Rhodamine derivative-Hg conjugate (RDM-Hg) as acceptor. Hg2+ weakens the fluorescence of HBO at 430 nm and meanwhile interacts with Rhodamine B derivative to form a fluorescent conjugate (RDM-Hg) giving rise to emission at 597 nm with a 167 nm red-shift. Further, the difference 282 nm between the donor absorption (315 nm) and the accepter emission (597 nm) for 1 + Hg2+ is comparable to the highest value of the Stokes shift (282 nm) reported earlier for other reported TBET-based cassette. Through-bond energy transfer from HBO to RDM-Hg is triggered by Hg2+ resulting in concentration dependent variation of fluorescence ratio I-597/I-430. A linear calibration of I-597/I-430 versus Hg2+ concentration is obtained within 0-5 mu M, along with the lowest detection limit being found to be as low as 1.31 x 10(-9) mol center dot l(-1) (similar to 0.26 ppb) for Hg2+. This feature is further demonstrated by colorimetric imaging of test strip and intracellular Hg2+. On the other hand, the HBO/RDM TBET sensing system is characterized by a combination of high sensitivity and selectivity. The present study provides an approach for further development of ratiometric probes dedicated to selective in vitro or in vivo sensing some species of biologically interest.

AB Electrically addressed covalent immobilization of biomolecules to the defined electrodes of an electrode array is described. It is based on Michael addition of the thiol group of biomolecules to alpha,beta-unsaturated carbonyl groups of benzoquinone. This "click" reaction was tested by immobilization of a number of thiolated compounds on the simplest array consisting of two gold electrodes coated by a self-assembled monolayer of benzoquinone-terminated hexanethiol. Electrically controlled binding of hexanethiol, ferrocenylhexanethiol, human serum albumin and thiol-terminated single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) was investigated. The binding was studied using cyclic voltammetry, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and surface plasmon resonance. The reaction requires the oxidized state of the benzoquinone moiety; this can be reached by applying of a moderate anodic potential to the electrode. Surface plasmon resonance measurements demonstrated that the thiol-modified ssDNA immobilized by this technique binds complementary synthetic oligonucleotides or PCR-amplified DNA fragments. The developed technology of electrical addressing of covalent immobilization can be applied for fabrication of sensor arrays.

AB In this study, we fabricated a label-free electrochemical immunosensor for sensitive and selective detection of tumor marker p53. This immunosensor was based on chitosan/carbon black composite (Chitosan-CB) layer coated ITO electrode. This composite was utilized for enhancement of the conductivity of the immunosensor. Anti-p53 antibodies were captured on the modified ITO electrode through the cross-linking of chitosan and glutaraldehyde. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and cyclic voltammetry (CV) techniques were utilized for electrochemical characterization of the proposed immunosensor. Moreover, the biosensor construction steps were monitored by using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM). The immobilization of anti-p53 antibodies on the electrode surface was investigated by using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and Raman spectroscopy. The change in impedance which formed during the specific interaction between anti-p53 antibody and p53 antigen was used to detect p53. Under optimized experimental conditions, the fabricated immunosensor had a wide linear range of 0.01-2 pg/mL and low detection limit of 3 fg/mL. The fabricated immunosensor had good sensitivity, stability and repeatability. Furthermore, it was successfully applied to analyze p53 in human serum.

AB This work reports the first demonstration of an oligonucleotide-modulated label-free homogeneous photoelectrochemical (PEC) biosensing platform based on the adsorption of tetracationic porphyrin (denoted as TMPyP here) onto 1-naphthalenesulfonate anion (NS-)-grafted indium tin oxide electrode (denoted as TMPyP-NS--ITO), which generates a stable and rapid photocurrent response. We found that when NS--ITO electrode was subjected to single-stranded oligonucleotide (ssON) before TMPyP adsorption, a remarkable enhancement of photocurrent intensity was observed from the resulted TMPyP-ssON-NS--ITO electrode with high specificity towards oligonucleotide. A series of investigations were carried out to understand the mechanism of this oligonucleotide-modulated photocurrent enhancement phenomenon. Moreover, the studies of this robust photo current enhancement mechanism was successfully extended to develop a signal-on homogeneous PEC biosensing platform for, as a proof-of-concept, label-free M.SssI methyltransferase activity analysis through a judiciously and compatibly engineered signal transduction strategy consisted of hairpin-shaped oligonucleotide probe, restriction endonuclease HpaII, and Exonuclease L The rationally designed homogeneous PEC biosensor exhibit sensitive PEC response toward M.SssI methyltransferase with a low detection limit of 3.5 mU/mL and a wide linear range from 0.01 to 120 U/mL. Additionally, we show that our homogeneous PEC biosensing platform can be also utilized to screen methyltransferase inhibitors. Therefore, this work will provide a distinctive paradigm for versatile homogeneous PEC biosensing platform that can be used as potential powerful tool toward innovative label-free bioanalytical purposes.

AB A novel and highly selective electrochemical sensing platform (ZnCl2-CF/GCE) based on combination of kiwi skin and zinc chloride nanoparticles was developed for the simultaneous detection of ascorbic acid (AA), dopamine (DA), and uric acid (UA). The constructed electrode shows a high surface area and micro-mesoporous structure. And the electrochemical behaviors of the electrode were further explored by cyclic voltammetry (CV), impedance analysis (EIS), and differential pulse voltammetry (DPV). Under the optimal conditions, the ZnCl2-CF provides a high sensitivity and selective signaling in the co-existence system of AA, DA, and UA with linear response ranges of 0.05-200 mu M, 2-2000 mu M, and 1-2500 mu M, respectively. The detection limits (S/N = 3) were calculated to be 0.02 mu M, 0.16 mu M, and 0.11 mu M, respectively. In addition, the method has been successfully applied to determine AA, DA, and UA in real samples, which provides potential applications in further sensing study.

AB In this work, a photoelectrochemical (PEC) sensor based on inorganic surface molecular imprinting Nb2O5 (MI-Nb2O5) for detection of bisphenol A (BPA) had been developed. In the PEC sensor, MI-Nb2O5 material was synthesized based on an in-situ surface molecular imprinting technique. The microstructure characteristics of the as-prepared photoactive materials were systematically investigated by XRD, SEM, TEM, XPS, Fria and UV-vis spectroscopy. The PEC detection results showed that the MI-Nb2O5 material had higher photocurrent responses and excellent selectivity for contaminant BPA under UV-light irradiation owing to the abundant special recognition sites on the surface of MI-Nb2O5. Besides, the PEC sensor exhibited a wide detection range from 0.01 nmol.L-1 to 30 nmol.L-1 with a low limit of detection (LOD) of 0.004 nmol.L-1. The interferences test showed that the sensor had a good selectivity to BPA molecules in the different interference solutions. This method combining molecular imprinting technique with photoelectrochemical detection measurement made a successful attempt to detect BPA and supplied a promising way to detect other environment pollutions rapidly and selectively in the future.

AB Herein, a straightforward and highly specific dot-blot immunoassay was successfully developed for the detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis antigen (10 kDa culture filtrate protein, CFP-10) via the formation of copper nanoshell on the gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) surface. The principle of dot-blot immunoassay was based on the reduction of Cu2+ ion on the GBP-CFP1OG2-AuNPs conjugates, which has gold binding and antigen binding affinities, simultaneously, favouring to appear red dot that can be observed with naked-eye. The dot intensity is proportional to the concentration of tuberculosis antigen CFP-10, which offers a detection limit of 7.6 pg/mL. The analytical performance of GBP-CFPIOG2-AuNPs-copper nanoshell dot-blot was superior than that of conventional silver nanoshell. This method was successfully applied to identify the CFP-10 antigen in the clinical urine sample with high sensitivity, specificity, and minimized sample preparation steps. This method exhibits great application potential in the field of nanomedical science for highly reliable point-of-care detection of CFP-10 antigen in real samples to early diagnosis of tuberculosis.

AB Monoamine neurotransmitters (MNTs) belong to one of the most important groups of neurotransmitters in the central nervous system. They play crucial role in functioning of cardiovascular, renal, and hormonal systems along with establishing human brain-body integration. Abnormal level of MNT is associated with numerous psychotic (schizophrenia, depression, dementia, etc.) and neurodegenerative diseases (Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, Huntington's disease, etc.), therefore their sensitive and robust detection is of great clinical significance. Electrochemical detection (ECD) techniques have been paving the path in this direction, for more than four decades now. Keeping the immense importance of MNTs in mind, this review has been formulated to describe fundamentals of MNTs followed by their clinical significance in neuroscience. Herein, we have emphasized on the ECD of MNTs, in various matrices reported till date. In order to provide information on ECD of MNTs in clinically comparable systems, we have included a comprehensive discussion on sensor design and its analytical performance towards analyzing MNTs in the in vitro, in vivo, and ex vivo models. An extensive table is also incorporated to provide better understanding of the role of MNTs in various clinical conditions. Furthermore, this review briefly discusses the challenges faced with EC sensing techniques and loopholes present in current research works. Apart from this, three extended tables are also included in this review, to provide an insight into the amount of work done in ECD of MNTs in last ten years (2008-2018). These tables comprehensively discuss sensor fabrication strategies for determining MNTs in various matrices and models along with their mode of detection and analytical performance.

AB This study developed a portable and sensitive biosensor for the detection of telomerase activity extracted from HeLa cells by monitoring urease regulated pH change. In the presence of telomerase, the telomerase substrate (TS) primer was elongated by adding telomeric repeats (TTAGGG)(n) firstly. The TS primer was then immobilized onto streptavidin magnesphere paramagnetic particles (PMPs). The elongated repeat unit can hybridize with biotinylated complementary DNA (cDNA) to specifically capture biotinylated urease onto PMPs. After magnetic separation, the PMPs complex was mixed with urea solution. As urease can catalyze the hydrolysis of urea into ammonia and induce pH increasing of the solution, the activity of telomerase can be detected by pH-sensitive dyes or by a portable pH meter easily. The changed pH has a linear relationship with the logarithm of the number of HeLa cells from 50 to 10,000 and with a detection limit of similar to 20 HeLa cells, which indicated the proposed method have potential application in telomerase-related cancer diagnosis.

AB We describe a 3-dimensional scaffold nanocomposite oxidase nanozyme (termed PtNPs@MnO2) formed from 2-dimensional MnO2 nanosheets grown on the surface of large platinum nanoparticles (PtNPs). The two components act synergistically in the catalytic oxidation of 3,3',5,5'-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB), due to the intimate contact between the two components and mutual electron transfer phenomena. The Wonton-like 3-dimensional structure of the nanocomposite is highly stable and was characterized by cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM). The PtNPs@MnO2 nanocomposite was employed in a sensing assay for the determination of glutathione (GSH) and dopamine (DA) with a linear range of 0.2 mu M-11 mu M for GSH and 0.1 mu M-1.1 mu M for DA. The limit of detection (LOD) and limit of quantification (LOQ) of GSH are 0.05 mu M (S/N = 3) and 0.17 mu M (S/N = 10), respectively. The LOD and LOQ for DA were estimated as 0.025 mu M and 0.083 mu M. The method was applied to analyze GSH in human serum samples and DA in pharmaceuticals.

AB Core-shell structured nanocomposites (named PtPd@NCS) with N-doped carbon shell and bimetal core (Pt and Pd) were fabricated through a facile strategy for the first time. The PtPd@NCS nanocomposites were obtained through reduction of K2PtCl4, H2PtCl6 and Na2PdCl4 species, self-polymerization of dopamine (DA) and co assembly of Pluronic F127 using a one-pot approach. DA serves as a reductant, as well as a carbon and nitrogen source. The core-shell structure of the PtPd@NCS nanocomposites was characterized and the result indicated that Pt-Pd nanoparticle core with a diameter of approximately 15 nm was encased in the N-doped carbon shells with a thickness of approximately 35 nm. The PtPd@NCS nanocomposites were used as an electrode material to prepare acetylcholinesterase (AChE) biosensors for detecting organophosphate pesticides. The obtained AChE biosensor exhibited a linear range of 1 x 10(-14) to 1 x 10(-10) M and 1 x 10(-9) to 1 x 10(-5) M within the detection limit of 7.9 x 10(-15) M for malathion, 1 x 10(-13) to 1 x 10(-6) within the detection limit of 7.1 x 10(-14) M for chlopyrifos, and 1 x 10(-14) to 1 x 10(-11) M and 1 x 10(-70) to 1 x 10(-5) M within the detection limit of 8.6 x 10(-15) M for parathion methyl. The proposed biosensor also exhibited high selectivity, reproducibility and stability. The AChE biosensor was also applied in real samples for detecting organophosphate pesticides and exhibited acceptable recovery. This work demonstrated that the PtPd@NCS had great potential in constructing biosensors to detect organophosphate pesticides and other analytes.

AB For over two decades, fast-scan cyclic voltammetry (FSCV) has served as a reliable analytical method for monitoring dopamine release in near real-time in vivo. However, contemporary FSCV techniques have been limited to measure only rapid (on the order of seconds, i.e. phasic) changes in dopamine release evoked by either electrical stimulation or elicited by presentation of behaviorally salient stimuli, and not slower changes in the tonic extracellular levels of dopamine (i.e. basal concentrations). This is because FSCV is inherently a differential method that requires subtraction of prestimulation tonic levels of dopamine to measure phasic changes relative to a zeroed baseline. Here, we describe the development and application of a novel voltammetric technique, multiple cyclic square wave voltammetry (M-CSWV), for analytical quantification of tonic dopamine concentrations in vivo with relatively high temporal resolution (10 s). M-CSWV enriches the electrochemical information by generating two dimensional voltammograms which enable high sensitivity (limit of detection, 0.17 nM) and selectivity against ascorbic acid, and 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC), including changes in pH. Using M-CSWV, a tonic dopamine concentration of 120 +/- 18 nM (n = 7 rats, +/- SEM) was determined in the striatum of urethane anethetized rats. Pharmacological treatments to elevate dopamine by selectively inhibiting dopamine reuptake and to reduce DOPAC by inhibition of monoamine oxidase supported the selective detection of dopamine in vivo. Overall, M-CSWV offers a novel voltammetric technique to quantify levels and monitor changes in tonic dopamine concentrations in the brain to further our understanding of the role of dopamine in normal behavior and neuropsychiatric disorders.

AB Anodic electroactive biofilms (EABs) need to overcome low current densities for applications such as microbial fuel cells or biosensors. EABs can store charge in self-produced redox proteins when temporarily left in open circuit, and discharge them once the electrode is appropriately repolarized, thus behaving as pseudocapacitors. Here we investigated the effect of such periodic polarization on the intrinsic nature of the EABs during their entire growth (i.e. starting from inoculation and for 10 days) on glassy carbon electrodes. An optimal periodic polarization (half-period of 10 s) greatly increased the maximum steady-state current density delivered by the Geobacter-dominated EABs (up to 1.10 +/- 0.02 mA cm(-2), n = 3 electrodes) when compared to continuously polarized EABs (0.41 +/- 0.04 inA cm(-2)); and increased the amount of electric charges produced per hour by 69 +/- 17% even taking into account the half-periods of open circuit. This enhancement was highly correlated with a substantial increase in charge carriers concentration (10.6 +/- 0.5 mM(e). vs. 2.9 +/- 0.6 mM(e).), allowing higher charge storage capacity and higher electron mobility across the EABs. Our results suggest that appropriate periodic polarizations may upregulate the expression of heme-containing redox proteins associated with the matrix, such as c-type cytochromes. The EABs grown under periodic polarization presented mushroom-like structures on their top layers, while EABs grown under continuous polarization were flat.

AB Nanomaterial-embedded sensors have been developed and applied to monitor various targets. Mycotoxins are fungal secondary metabolites that can exert carcinogenic, mutagenic, teratogenic, immunotoxic, and estrogenic effects on humans and animals. Consequently, the need for the proper regulation on foodstuff and feed materials has been recognized from times long past. This review provides an overview of recent developments in electrochemical sensors and biosensors employed for the detection of mycotoxins. Basic aspects of the toxicity of mycotoxins and the implications of their detection are comprehensively discussed. Furthermore, the development of different molecular recognition elements and nanomaterials required for the detection of mycotoxins (such as portable biosensing systems for point-of-care analysis) is described. The current capabilities, limitations, and future challenges in mycotoxin detection and analysis are also addressed.

AB Enzymes are highly specific and selective due to their precise, intricate three-dimensional catalytic- structure. Electron transfer in enzymes normally occurs through an active-metal centers or tunneling events that are highly insulated by the surrounding globular protein structure. In case of electrochemically active enzymes/proteins, the distance between the redox-active cofactor and the electrode surface plays key role during direct communication. Therefore, the long electron-tunneling distance can be overcome by introducing mobile redox mediators such as nanostructures specially nanowires which can diffuse into and out of the enzyme active site, ferrying reducing or oxidizing equivalents with them. Therefore, nanowire-conjugated enzymes have gained great interest in the development of biosensor devices and other electrocatalytic-biological applications. Herein we present a comprehensive review about the electrochemical enzyme-based sensor using nanowires. Over the past decade, nanowires were investigated as a versatile platform for various applications including sensors and biosensors because of their high aspect ratio and a high surface-to-volume ratio. This review aimed to summarize some of the recent developments in the enzyme based sensor research that have been achieved with various metallic and non-metallic one-dimensional nanostructure i.e. nanowires. Due to low or no toxicity and biocompatibility, enzymes conjugated with nanowires are still highly specific, sensitive and biologically active. This review demonstrates the potential usability of nanowired-enzymes for the bioanalytical applications. The review includes various types of nanowires, mode of the enzyme integration or immobilization methodologies, probe modification, biosensor fabrication and real or spiked sample testing. Biosensor parameters such as linear range and sensitivity, selectivity and detection limit of reported sensors were also considered herein. We also introduce some of the new nanowire materials which have not yet been used for biosensing or biosensor application. The limitations, challenges and prospects for the use of nanowired-enzymes in electrochemical and other real-time sensing systems as well as fabrication technologies are also discussed in this review.

AB In this work, we report a novel sensor for colorimetric and fluorometric H2O2 sensing which is based on silver nanoparticles decorated and tetraphenylethene probe doped silica nanoparticles (Ag@TPE-SiO2 NPs). A positively charged tetraphenylethene (TPE) probe is doped into silica nanoparticles, and the nanoparticles exhibit strong fluorescence emission due to aggregation-induced emission (AIE) of the TPE probe. Ag nanoparticles (AgNPs) are prepared in situ on the surface of the silica nanoparticles. AgNPs serve as a nanoquencher which can quench the AIE emission of the TPE-SiO2 NPs efficiently. However, AgNPs can be oxidized to As+ by H2O2, which leads to fluorescence recovery and color fading of the Ag@TPE-SiO2 NPs. The dual-readout strategy allows sensitive analysis of H2O2. The detection limit of the fluorometric and colorimetric assay is 0.28 and 2.1 mu M, respectively. And the nanosensor also shows good selectivity. In addition, analysis of H2O2 in human serum and intracellular imaging of H2O2 are both demonstrated. With the good analytical properties of merit, the proposed nanoprobe has a promising potential for H2O2 related bioanalysis and biomedical applications.

AB In this work, ultrathin Ti3C2-MXene nanosheets were synthesized by minimally intensive layer delamination methods, and uniformly functionalized with aminosilane (f-Ti3C2-MXene) to provide a covalent binding for the immobilized bio-receptor (anti-CEA) for label free, ultrasensitive detection of cancer biomarker (carcinoem-bryonic antigen, CEA). The effect of different redox probes on the electrochemical behavior of f-Ti3C2-MXene was investigated and found that hexaammineruthenium ([Ru(NH3)(6)](3+)) is the preferable redox probe for bio-sensing. The fabricated biofunctionalized Ti3C2-MXene exhibits a linear detection range of 0.0001-2000 ng mL(-1) with sensitivity of 37.9 mu A ng(-1) mL cm(-2) per decade. The wider linear detection range of our f-Ti3C2-MXene is not only higher than previously reported pristine 2D nanomaterials, but is even comparable to other hybrid 2D nanomaterials. We believe that this work opens a new window for development of MXene-based highly sensitive DNA, aptamer, enzyme, antibody, and cell based biosensors, and could be further used in drug delivery application.

AB Herein, N-(4-aminobutyl)-N-(ethylisoluminol) functionalized Fe-based metal-organic frameworks (ABEI/MIL-101(Fe)) with intrinsic mimic peroxidase activity was synthesized and utilized as highly efficient ECL indicator to construct sensitive immunosensor for mucin1 (MUC1) detection. Firstly, compared with the traditional method for ABEI immobilization, the proposed strategy could successfully achieve the highly efficient ABEI immobilization as ABEI coupled 2-aminoterephhalic acid was used as organic bridge ligand. Moreover, the ABEI/MIL-101(Fe) containing the same luminescent group as luminol could emit strong light when using hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) as a co-reactant. It is worth noting that the ECL signal of ABEI/MIL-101(Fe) could be greatly heightened due to the intrinsic mimic peroxidase activity of ABEI/MIL-101(Fe) that could accelerate the decomposition of H2O2 and produce considerable numbers of reactive oxygen radicals to participate in the ECL reaction of ABEI. The fabricated ECL immunosensor displayed a low detection limit of 1.6 fg mL(-1) for MUC1, indicating that the synthesized ABEI/MIL-101(Fe) with intrinsic mimic peroxidase activity may be applied to realize ultrasensitive detection of other biomarkers in early diagnosis.

AB In this work, carboxylated multi walled carbon nanotubes (CMWCNTs) were firstly prepared and functionalized with poly-L-histidine (PLH), which were then chelated with copper (II) ions to from the nanocomposites of Cu (II)-PLH-CMWCNTs. The nanocomposites could be exploited as an efficient mimic enzyme for sensitive electrochemical detection of salvianic acid A (SAA). Cu(II)-PLH-CMWCNTs owned good charge transfer property and excellent synergetic catalytic effect between the overoxidized imidazole groups and the copper redox-active units. Therefore, highly sensitive electrochemical response to SAA was achieved under optimum experimental conditions. A good linear relationship between differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) peak current and the SAA concentration was established in the range of 0.4-1000 mu M. A low detection limit of 0.037 mu M and a sensitivity of 0.27 mu A mu M-1 cm(-2) were achieved. The developed biosensor also had advantages of good repeatability, stability and high selectivity, thus, it was successfully applied to the determination of SAA in real samples with satisfactory results, which may have great potential for further exploitation of electroanalysis applications.

The biosensor features the layer-by-layer (LbL) self-assembly of negatively charged xanthine oxidase (XOD) and positively charged poly(diallyldimethyl ammonium chloride) (PDDA) wrapped oxidized multi-walled carbon nanotubes and graphene (CNTs-G) complexes (PDDA-CNTs-G) on screen printed carbon electrode (SPCE) surfaces. Catalytic responses of the XOD modified biosensor with the chosen optimum number of layers for LbL assembly on SPCE towards Hx in buffer solutions were first investigated using both cyclic and square wave voltammetries. The peak current at around 0.08 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) associated with the production of UA increased as a function of the Hx concentration due to the surface selective catalytic reaction of XOD and Hx. A linear dynamic range of 5-50 mu M Hx with a detection limit of 4.40 mu M was obtained and the sensor was further applied to the analysis of Hx in normal human serum solutions in addition to myocardial infarction (MI) patient serum sample solutions from a local hospital. Since untreated serum solutions contain a certain amount of UA, a XOD free SPCE biosensor consisted of only PDDA-CNTs-G was also employed to evaluate the native concentration of UA in the serum and further assist the determination of Fix concentration when using the developed LbL biosensor. Our sensing results for the real biological fluidic solutions were finally validated by comparing to those using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry(LC-MS).

AB Utilizing biosensors for multiplexed detection can greatly increase analysis throughput and thus, the amount of information obtained in a single assay. The microfluidic chip, a type of micro-total analysis system (mu TAS), has provided a necessary platform for portable and high-throughput biosensors. Biosensors and microfluidic chips are powerful individually, and their super combination is very meaningful for analytical especially for biological applications. In this paper, every kind of microfluidic-chip-integrated electronic biosensors including some emerging technologies for simultaneous detection of multiple analytes are reviewed. Different ways to reduce or avoid cross-talking and more efforts to achieve lab on chip multisensors were also introduced to help readers form a general idea of current developments in different angles.

AB Detection of the hybridisation events is of great importance in many different biotechnology applications such as diagnosis, computing, molecular bioelectronics, and among others. However, one important drawback is the low current of some redox reporters that limits their application. This paper demonstrates the powerful features of molecular wires, in particular the case of S-[442[4-(2-Phenylethynyl)phenyl]ethynyl]phenyl] thiol molecule and the key role that play the nanometric design of the capture probe linkers to achieve an efficient couple of the DNA complementary ferrocene label with the molecular wire for an effective electron transfer in co-immobilised self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) for DNA hybridisation detection. In this article, the length of the linker capture probe was studied for electron transfer enhancement from the ferrocene-motifs of immobilised molecules towards the electrode surface to obtain higher kinetics in the presence of thiolated molecular wires. The use of the right couple of capture probe linker and molecular wire has found to be beneficial as it helps to amplify eightfold the signal obtained.

AB y Cathodic oxygen reduction catalyzed by autotrophic bacteria instead of a precious metal is a promising method to make use of microbial fuel cells (MFCs) in wastewater treatment with electricity production. However, the ecology of electrotrophic microbial consortia in wastewater systems that function as the catalyst for cathodic oxygen reduction is complicated and the electron transfer mechanisms are still unknown, which prevents further improvements of the biocathode performance. Enriched by the repeated transfer of a mature electrotrophic microbial consortia to new cathodes over 10 generations in 230 days, the start-up time was shortened from 21.4 to 7.6 days and the maximum current densities over the potential range of 0.5 to - 0.3 V increased by up to 112%, from 75 +/- 5 A m(-3) to 159 +/- 3 A m(-3), which was further confirmed in half-cell biocathode systems. The electrotrophic microbial consortia approached a relatively stable state after 8 generations. Acinetobacter, which is a member of Proteobacteria, was selectively enriched after 10 generations, which was closely related to the current production. Nitrospiraceae and Nitrosomonas may jointly perform a nitrogen cycling metabolic process and promote cathodic bioelectron transfer. Our findings confirmed that the electrotrophic microbial consortia on the cathode was able to be specifically evolved, leading to higher electroactivity, and also revealed which bacteria in fresh water are closely related to cathodic electron transfer.

AB This review is an attempt to describe advancements in the electrochemistry of cytochrome P450 enzymes (EC 1.14.14.1) and to study molecular aspects and catalytic behavior of enzymatic electrocatalysis. Electroanalysis of cytochrome P450 demonstrates how to translate theoretical laws and equations of classical electrochemistry for the calculation of the kinetic parameters of enzymatic reactions and then translation of kinetic parameters to interpretation of drug-drug interactions. The functional significance of cytochrome P450s (CYPs) includes the metabolism of drugs, foreign chemicals, and endogenic compounds. The pharmaceutical industry needs sensitive and cost-effective systems for screening new drugs and investigation of drug-drug interactions. The development of different types of CYP-based biosensors is now in great demand. This review also highlights the characteristics of electrode processes and electrode properties for optimization of the cytochrome P450 electroanalysis. Electrochemical cytochrome P450-biosensors are the most studied. In this review, we analyzed electrode/cytochrome P450 systems in terms of the mechanisms underlying P450-catalyzed reactions. Screening of potential substrates or inhibitors of cytochromes P450 by means of electrodes were described.

AB MWCNT-COOH, TEMPO-modified linear poly(ethylenimine), and alcohol (ADH) and aldehyde (AldDH) dehydrogenase immobilization on electrode surfaces yields a hybrid, tri-catalytic architecture that can catalyze complete ethanol electro-oxidation. The chromatographic results obtained for the tri-catalytic hybrid electrode system show that ethanol is totally oxidized to CO2 after 12 h of electrolysis, confirming that organic oxidation catalysts combined with enzymatic catalysts enable collection of up to 12 electrons from ethanol. The Faradaic efficiency lies above 60% for all of the electrode systems investigated herein. Overall, this study illustrates that surface-immobilized, polymer hydrogel-based hybrid multi-catalytic systems exhibit high oxidation rates and constitute a simple methodology with useful application in the development of enzymatic biofuel cells.

AB An ultrasensitive label-free photoelectrochemical (PEC) immunosensor with high visible-light activity was developed for quantitative detection of amyloid beta-protein (A beta) by cross-linking anti-All antibody onto the Ag2S sensitized SnO2/SnS2 nanocomposites. Specifically, SnO2 with flower-like porous nanostructure was innovatively applied in PEC immunosensor as a basal material. It could form a heterostructure with SnS2, which brought about the sensitization of SnO2 and enhanced the separation of photogenerated electrons and holes. Moreover, Ag2S was in-situ growth on the surface of SnO2/SnS2, which further enhanced the photocurrent response significantly. Therefore, SnO2/SnS2/Ag2S could form stepwise band-edge structure, which benefited the light harvesting and provided a good foundation for sensor construction and detection. Under optimal conditions, the PEC immunosensor was used to detect the content of A beta and exhibited a wide linear concentration range from 0.5 pg mL(-1) to 100 ng mL(-1), with low limit of detection (0.17 pg mL(-1)) and limit of quantification (0.56 pg mL(-1)). Additionally, the designed PEC immunosensor exhibited good reproducibility, specificity, and stability which may find potential applications in the biosensor, biomedicine, clinical diagnosis, photocatalysis and other related fields.

AB In this work, a competitive and label-free electrochemical platform was performed for the ultrasensitive cytosensing of liver cancer cells based on DNA nanotetrahedron (NTH) structure and rolling circle amplification (RCA) directed DNAzyme strategy. The multifunctional nanoprobes were fabricated through a DNA primer probe, carboxyfluorescein (FAM) functionalized TLS11a aptamer and horseradish peroxidase (HRP) immobilized on the surfaces of the platinum nanoparticles (PtNPs). Then the NTH-based complementary DNA (cDNA) probe, complementary to the TLS11a aptamer, was attached on a disposable screen-printed gold electrode (SPGE) for increasing the reactivity and accessibility with the prepared nanoprobes. Due to the primer probe and the circular probe with G-quadruplex sequences for RCA, it can lead to the formation of numerous G-quadruplex/hemin DNAzyme, thus generating a remarkable electrochemical response. When the target cells were present, the nanoprobes were released from the SPGE due to the specific recognition of TLS11a aptamers for HepG2 cells, resulting in the electrochemical signal changes. The cytosensor was ultrasensitive for HepG2 tumor cell detection with a detection limit of 3 cell per mL. Furthermore, this strategy was also demonstrated to be applicable for cancer cell imaging. In summary, this electrochemical cytosensor holds great potential for circulating tumor cell detection in the early cancer diagnose.

AB In this protocol, a dual-channel homogeneous aptasenor was proposed for protein molecule determination, employing thrombin as target analyte. The colorimetric and electrochemical transducers were combined in a single analytical system for signal readout. In this dual-channel sensing strategy, the G-quadruplex sequence was released and incorporated with hemin to form DNAzyme for naked-eye colorimetric detection. Meanwhile, the hydroxyapatite nanoparticle as signal probe was combined with magnetic nanoparticles to construct sandwich type structure for generating the electrochemical current when thrombin was present in solution. By introducing two kinds of reporter probes and transducers, this dual-channel sensor produced two different kinds of signal to improve the analytical accuracy and diversity. The results revealed that the dual-channel sensor achieved the quantatitive determination of thrombin with low limit of detection (0.40 fM) and wide range (0.1 fM to 1 nM), which offer a promise for rapid and accurate detection of biomolecule.

AB The simultaneous measurement of the concentration of anticancer drugs with a fast, sensitive and accurate method in biological samples is a challenge for better monitoring of drug therapy and better determine the pharmacokinetics. An electrochemical sensor was developed for the simultaneous determination of anticancer drugs, Ifosfamide (IFO) and Etoposide (ETO) based on pencil graphite electrode modified with Au/Pd@rGO nanocomposite decorated with poly (L-Cysteine). Cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) were utilized to study the properties of the modified electrode. The electrochemical behavior of IFO and ETO on the Au/Pd@rGO@p(L-Cys) modified electrode was investigated by cyclic voltammetry and differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) techniques and the obtained results confirmed its efficiency for the individual and simultaneous sensing of IFO and ETO. After optimization of electrochemical parameters, the fabricated sensor presented excellent performance in simultaneous determination of IFO and ETO with a wide linear range from 0.10 to 90.0 mu M and 0.01 to 40.0 mu M and low detection limits (3 S-b/m) of 9.210 nM and 0.718 nM, respectively. In addition, this study proved that the constructed sensor could be useful to simultaneous analysis of IFO and ETO in biological samples and pharmaceutical compounds.

AB Microfluidic devices can discriminate particles based on their properties and map them into different locations on the device. For distributed detection of these particles, we have recently introduced a multiplexed sensing technique called Microfluidic CODES, which combines code division multiple access with Coulter sensing. Our technique relies on micromachined sensor geometries to produce distinct waveforms that can uniquely be linked to specific locations on the microfluidic device. In this work, we investigated the scaling of the code-multiplexed Coulter sensor network through theoretical and experimental analysis. As a model system, we designed and fabricated a microfluidic device integrated with a network of 10 code-multiplexed sensors, each of which was characterized and verified to produce a 31-bit orthogonal digital code. To predict the performance of the sensor network, we developed a mathematical model based on communications and coding theory, and calculated the error rate for our sensor network as a function of the network size and sample properties. We theoretically and experimentally demonstrated the effect of electrical impedance on the signal-to-noise ratio and developed an optimized device. We also introduced a computational approach that can process the sensor network data with minimal input from the user and demonstrated system-level operation by processing suspensions of cultured human cancer cells. Taken together, our results demonstrated the feasibility of deploying large-scale code-multiplexed electrode networks for distributed Coulter detection to realize integrated lab-on-a-chip devices.

AB A novel ratiometric electrochemiluminescent (ECL) biosensor was designed for the detection of concanavalin A (Con A) based on two ECL emitters competing for the dissolved oxygen (O-2). In this strategy, CdTe quantum dots (QDs) were used as the cathodic emitter and N-(aminobutyl)-N-(ethylisoluminol) (ABEI) was used as the anodic emitter. With the presence of dissolved 02 utilized as co-reactant, CdTe QDs showed an ECL emission at - 1.7 V, and ABEI showed an emission at + 0.6 V. Phenoxy-derivatized dextran (Dexp), as a recognition element, was immobilized by graphene oxide functionalized CdTe QDs (G-CdTe QDs) to recognize Con A, and further combine with Dexp, gold and platinum nanoparticles decorated ABEI (Dexp-Au-Pt-ABEI) to form a sandwich structure. With the increasing concentration of analyte Con A, the ECL signal of cathodic CdTe QDs decreased and the anodic response of ABEI increased, thus achieving a ratiometry detection of Con A with a wide linear range from 1.0 x 10(-4) ng/mL to 10 ng/mL. The detection limit was low to 3.0 x 10(-5) ng/mL. This proposed ratiometric ECL biosensor not only conquered the false errors caused by external interferences, but excluded the disability caused by exogenous co-reactant via the application of common dissolved O-2. It also exhibited an excellent stability, selectivity and reproducibility.

AB Cancer diagnosis continuously evolves due to the better understanding of tumorigenic processes. DNA-methylation is consolidated as an effective biomarker for cancer prognosis and diagnostic even in tumors of unknown origin. The reversibility of this epigenetic mechanism also places it as a high-profile tool for the development of more sophisticated and personalized therapies. Current methodologies, such as bisulfite conversion or PCR amplification, rely on complex procedures that make difficult the standardization of epigenetics analyses. Here we present an optical biosensor methodology based on Surface Plasmon Resonance that employs poly-purine reverse-Hoogsten hairpin probes capable of interacting directly with ds-DNA fragments by triple helix formation. The direct interaction with the material of interest can greatly enhance the reliability of the analysis providing a more accurate and precise diagnosis. We have demonstrated the capabilities of our methodology for the direct capture of ds-DNA fragments and specific methyl-cytosine quantification. Our poly-purine hairpin probe demonstrated the specific capture of ds-DNA fragments while the standard duplex-forming probes failed to do so. In addition, the biosensor methodology showed a strong correlation with the different DNA methylation status between the sequences with a low signal variation (<= 8%CV) along 35 hybridization/regeneration cycles. Through its straightforward procedure and versatility of detecting different DNA modifications related to the DNA methylation process, we anticipate that our strategy will enable a greater level of accuracy and precision in cancer diagnostics making a strong impact on the development of personalized therapies.

AB Three layer-by-layer (LBL) assembled gold nanoparticles (AuNPs)/lower-generation (Gn <= 3) polyamidoamine dendrimer (PD) with reduced graphene oxide (rGO) as the core/mercaptopropinoic acid (MPA)/Au were successfully fabricated and employed as electrochemical gene nanobiosensing platforms with three-dimensional (3D) fractal nanoarchitecture for fast, ultra-trace determination of label-free DNA hybridization. Three Gn <= 3PD were initially grafted to graphite oxide (GO) via the covalent functionalization between amino terminals of PD and carboxyl terminals of GO where a concomitant reduction of GO, which were covalently linked onto MPA that was self-assembled onto Au substrate, and finally AuNPs were encapsulated onto GG1PD by strong physicochemical interaction between AuNPs and-OH of rGO in GG1PD, Their morphologies, structures, electrochemical properties, and gene nanobiosensing performances were characterized and evaluated. AuNPs/GG2PD-based probe displayed the best excellent structural stability, lowest mobility on solid surface with the increasing charge resistance, widest linear range (1.1 x 10(-6) - 1 x 10(-18)), and the lowest limit of detection (1.87 x 10(-19) M) in comparison with both AuNPs/GG1PD-based and AuNPs/GG3PD-based probes. This work will provide a new candidate for the development of metal nanoparticles functionalized PD with inorganic nonmetallic nanomaterials as cores with 3D fractal nanoarchitecture and promising electrochemical gene nanobiosensing platforms based on dendrimer-nanoinorganic hybrids with 3D nanoarchitectures and LBL assembly for fast and ultra-trace detection of label-free DNA hybridization with potential application in bioanalysis and medical diagnosis of genetic diseases.

AB The construction of a photoelectrochemical (PEC) strategy for multi-component detection represents a great challenge in the field of sensing. To address these challenges, herein we presented a hollow-channel paper-based PEC analytical platform based on chemiluminescence (CL) addressable strategies excited PEC strategy for multiplexed sensing application. Sandwich-structured CdS quantum dots (QDs)/reduced graphene oxide (RGO)/ZnO nanorods arrays (NRAs) heterostructure where CdS serves as visible light sensitizers, RGO acts as an electron relay between ZnO NRAs and CdS QDs, were simply assembled on the gold nanoparticles modified paper working photoelectrode (Au-PWE). The PEC performance of the CdS/RGO/ZnO can be greatly improved benefiting from the formation of type II band alignment between CdS QDs and ZnO NR as well as the super charge collection and shuttling property of RGO. Multiplexed CL emission could be achieved through controlling the CL co-reagents transport. By the virtue of CL addressable technique and the excellent PEC activity of CdS/RGO/ZnO, a highly sensitive, and selective multiple microRNAs (miRNAs) quantification method was achieved. Such a tailored strategy would break the bottleneck of the current PEC detection techniques in multiplex tracing, as well as serve as a novel concept for designing multi-channel PEC sensing method.

AB Though preferable progresses have been achieved to improve the photoelectric performance of fullerene (C-60 NPs) by sensitized structure in photoelectrochemical (PEC) field, further application inevitably suffers from the inherent scarcities of heavy metal-involved quantum dots as sensitizers containing restricted sensitization effect, complex preparation and biological toxicity. In this work, a PEC biosensor based on [Ru(dcbpy)(2)dppz](2+)/Rose Bengal dyes co-sensitized C-60 NPs was constructed for ultrasensitive DNA (a fragment sequence of p53 gene) detection. With the merits of low toxicity and accessible operation, [Ru(dcbpy)(2)dppz](2+)/Rose Bengal dyes exhibited a further sensitization efficiency towards C-60 NPs. Through modifying wide band gap C-60 NPs with two narrower band gap dyes ([Ru(dcbpy)(2)dppz](2+) and Rose Bengal) to form a cascade-type energy band structure, the photoelectric conversion of C-60 NPs was significantly improved and the visible light absorption was markedly promoted, leading to an exceptional photocurrent signal. Additionally, Nt center dot BstNB I enzyme-assisted target recycling amplification was employed to convert a limited quantity of target to numerous SiO2 NPs-labeled DNA sequences (the signal quencher), resulting in a sharp decrement of photocurrent since a dramatic increment of steric hindrance on the modified electrode surface, which was performed to quantitatively estimate target. The proposed PEC biosensor for DNA detection possessed a wide linear range from 0.1 fM to 1 nM with a calculated detection limit of 37 aM. This work opened up an intriguing avenue for determination of various targets such as DNAs, microRNAs and proteins, and exhibited desirable application potential in the clinic researches, cancer therapies and other related subjects.

AB Conventional analytical techniques, which have been developed for high sensitivity and selectivity for the detection and quantification of relevant biomarkers, may not be as suitable for medical diagnosis in resource scarce environments as compared to point-of-care devices (POC). We have developed a new reactive sensing material which contains ionic gold entrapped within an agarose gel scaffold for POC quantification of ascorbic acid (AA) in tear fluid. Pathologically elevated concentration of AA in human tear fluid can serve as a biomarker for full thickness injuries to the ocular surface, which are a medical emergency. This reactive sensing material will undergo colorimetric changes, quantitatively dependent on endogenous bio-reductants that are applied, as the entrapped ionic gold is reduced to form plasmonic nanoparticles. The capacity for this reactive material to function as a plasmonically driven biosensor, called 'OjoGel' (ojo-eye), was demonstrated with the endogenous reducing agent, AA. Through applications of AA of varied concentrations to the OjoGel, we demonstrated a quantitative colorimetric relationship between red (R) hexadecimal values and concentrations of AA in said treatments. This colorimetric relationship is directly resultant of plasmonic gold nanoparticle formation within the OjoGel scaffold. Using a commercially available mobile phone-based Pixel Picker (R) application, the OjoGel plasmonic sensing platform opens a new avenue for easy-to-use, rapid, and quantitative biosensing with low cost and accurate results.

AB A three-dimensional graphene-based ratiometric signal amplification aptasensor for highly sensitive and selective detection of mucin1 (MUC1) by electrochemical method has been developed. Au-reduced graphene oxide (Au-RGO) composite, which was synthesized through hydrothermal reaction and freeze-drying treatment, was used as substrate for fabricating the sensor interface on glassy carbon electrode (GCE). The application of Au-RGO is beneficial for improving electrochemical performance and immobilizing aptamer. Ferrocene labeled aptamer (Fc-Apt), grafting on Au-RGO composite, worked for specific recognition of MUC1 and as internal reference to improve the detection accuracy. Au nanoparticle modified with methyl blue labeled aptamer (MB-Apt@Au) was adopted to combine with MUC1 that captured on the electrode surface to amplify the electrical signal. Under optimal experimental conditions, this sensor was applied to detect a series concentration of MUC1 solution by alternating current voltammetry method. The aptasensor shows satisfactory detection results with a wide linear range of 1 pM to 1 mu M, a low detection limit of 0.25 pM and good specificity. The good performance of the prepared electrochemical aptasensor implies that this method has potential for MUC1 detection, and it would be promising for early screening and diagnosis of cancer diseases. The proposed method also lays an important foundation for preparing ratiometric signal amplification aptasensor for other biomarkers detection.

AB The challenges of diagnosing infectious disease, especially in the developing world, and the shortcomings of available instrumentation have exposed the need for portable, easy-to-use diagnostic tools capable of detecting the wide range of causative microbes while operating in low resource settings. We present a centrifugal microfluidic platform that combines ultrasensitive immunoassay and isothermal amplification-based screening for the orthogonal detection of both protein and nucleic acid targets at the point-of-care. A disposable disc with automatic aliquoting inlets is paired with a non-contact heating system and precise rotary control system to yield an easy-to-use, field-deployable platform with versatile screening capabilities. The detection of three enterotoxins (cholera toxin, Staphylococcal enterotoxin B, and Shiga-like toxin 1) and three enteric bacteria (C. jejuni, E. coli, and S. typhimuriwn) were performed independently and shown to be highly sensitive (limit of detection = 1.35-5.50 ng/mL for immunoassays and 1-30 cells for isothermal amplification), highly exclusive in the presence of non-specific targets, and capable of handling a complex sample matrix like stool. The full panel of toxins and bacteria were reliably detected simultaneously on a single disc at clinically relevant sample concentrations in less than an hour. The ability of our technology to detect multiple analyte types in parallel at the point-of-care can serve a variety of needs, from routine patient care to outbreak triage, in a variety of settings to reduce disease impact and expedite effective treatment.

AB Graphene-embedded plant tissues show a high sensitivity to electrochemical signals, which enables a screen printed electrode to be used for electrochemical fingerprint recording. The electrochemical fingerprints obtained under different conditions can be transformed into multidimensional recognition modes for plant identification. These electrochemical fingerprints reflect the types and quantities of the electrochemically active substances in plant tissues such that the fingerprints can be used for chemotaxonomic investigations. In this paper, five species of Lycoris bulbs, including L. chinensis, L. radiate, L. aurea, L. sprengeri and L. straminea, were successfully recognized by electrochemical fingerprinting. The species's interspecific relationships were also investigated. L. chinensis and L. aurea show highly similar morphology but have a relatively distant relationship. Hybridized L. radiata shows a notably close relationship with L. straminea, suggesting that one of its parents may be L. radiata. In addition, L. chinensis also shows a close relationship with L. straminea, suggesting that the L. straminea may be produced by cross-breeding L. chinensis and L. radiate. The results mentioned above indicate that the proposed electro-chemotaxonomic methodology is an inexpensive and quick taxonomic method that can provide additional evidence for the existing taxonomy system.

AB Molecularly Imprinted Polymers (MIPs) are synthetic receptors capable of selective binding to their target (template) molecules and, hence, are used as recognition elements in assays and sensors as a replacement for relatively unstable enzymes and antibodies. Herein, we describe a manufacturing-friendly protocol for integration of MIP nanoparticles (nanoMlPs) with a (label-free) capacitive sensor. The nanoMlPs were produced by solid-phase synthesis for two templates with different sizes and properties, including a small molecule tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and a protein (trypsin). NanoMIPs were deposited on the surface of the sensor and the change in capacitance (Delta C) upon binding of the target was measured. The significant improvement in the selectivity and limit of detection (one order of magnitude compared to previously used MIP microparticles) can be attributed to their increased surface-to-volume ratio and higher specificity of the nanoMlPs produced by the solid-phase method. The methodology described is also compatible with common sensor fabrication approaches, as opposed to methods involving in situ MIP polymerisation. The proposed sensor shows high selectivity, fast sensor response (45 min including injection, regeneration and re-equilibration with running buffer), and straightforward data analysis, which makes it viable for label-free monitoring in real-dine. The set of targets assessed in this manuscript shows the general applicability of the biosensor platform.

AB Poly(ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) has attracted considerable attention as an advanced electrode material for electrochemical sensors and biosensors, due to its unique electrical and physicochemical properties. Here, we demonstrate the facile preparation of a positively-charged and hierarchical micro-structured PEDOT electrochemical interface with enhanced electrode kinetics for the electrooxidation of NADH. Processable PEDOT colloidal microparticles (PEDOT CMs) were synthesised by template-assisted polymerisation and were then utilised as building blocks for the fabrication of hierarchically-structured electrodes with a larger accessible electroactive surface (2.8 times larger than that of the benchmark PEDOT:PSS) and inter-particle space, thus improving electrode kinetics. The intrinsic positive charge of the PEDOT CMs further facilitated the detection of negatively-charged molecules by electrostatic accumulation. Due to the synergistic effect, these hierarchically structured PEDOT CMs electrodes exhibited improved NADH electrooxidation at lower potentials and enhanced electrocatalytic activity compared to the compact structure of conventional PEDOT:PSS electrodes. The PEDOT CMs electrodes detected NADH over the range of 20-240 mu M, with a sensitivity of 0.0156 mu A/mu M and a limit of detection of 5.3 mu M. Moreover, the PEDOT CMs electrode exhibited a larger peak separation from the interferent ascorbic acid, and improved stability. This enhanced analytical performance for NADH provides a sound basis for further work coupling to a range of NAD-dependent dehydrogenases for applications in biosensing, bio-fuel cells and biocatalysis.

AB The present study aimed to develop a highly sensitive label-free electrochemical aptasensor for the detection of Diazinon (DZN), as one of the most widespread organophosphorus compounds. The aptasensor was assembled using screen-printed gold electrode modified by thiolated aptamers which were immobilized on gold nano particles (Au NPs). Optimum deposition time, in which the highest electrochemical response occurred, was found in 150 s. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry were used to characterize electrochemical properties of the novel aptasensor. Electrochemical detection was carried out through differential pulse voltammetry in [Fe(CN)(6)](3-/4-) solution. Fluctuation of the current was examined in the DZN concentration range of 0.1-1000 nM. According to the results, the designed aptasensor provided an extremely lower limit of detection (0.0169 nM) compared with HPLC and other colorimetric techniques for DZN detection. The present highly specific designed aptasensor doesn't interact with other analytes in the real sample. Consequently, the present aptasensor is easy to use and relatively inexpensive with a good sensitivity, stability, and reproducibility for this application. We are now evaluating all approaches to make a portable device for fast and sensitive quantification of DZN and related OPs.

AB MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small, endogenous, noncoding RNAs, shown to be expressed abnormally in many tumors and identified as predictive biomarkers for early diagnosis of several cancers including the breast. Therefore, the label-free and highly sensitive detection of miRNAs is of critical significance. In this work, a highly sensitive and label-free nano-genosensor is developed for the detection of miRNA-21, a known breast cancer biomarker, based on a specific architecture of nitrogen-doped functionalized graphene (NFG), silver nanoparticles (AgNPs), and polyaniline (PANI) that resulted in a remarkable effect on signal amplification. Following the successful functionalization of the nanocomposite and immobilization of the specific sequence of the aminated complementary oligonucleotide of miRNA-21, the detection was performed using differential pulse voltammetry (DPV). The oxidation peak current of the redox probe under optimal conditions was determined to monitor the event hybridization of miRNA-21 biomarker. Applying this highly sensitive and optimized nano-biosensor enabled detection of a wide dynamic range of 10 fM-10 mu M with a sensitivity of 2.5 mu A cm(-2) and a low detection limit of 0.2 fM. This nano-biosensor also demonstrated highly reproducible results in the analysis of blood samples, with recoveries between 94% and 107%, and could be used for early detection of breast cancer by direct detection of the miRNA-21 in real clinical samples without any need to sample preparation, RNA extraction and/or amplification.

AB Cholesterol is an essential compound for maintaining cellular homeostasis and human healthy. Sensitive detection of cholesterol and efficient elimination of excess cholesterol have become the essential manipulations in clinical diagnosis and health management. To date, it is still quite challenging that cholesterol detection and elimination tasks are carried out simultaneously. In this study, bifunctional magnetic nanoparticles (Fe3O4@PDA-PBA-CD) are designed and fabricated to overcome this difficulty. Taking advantages of competitive host guest interaction and magnetic separation, highly efficient, reusable and simultaneous cholesterol detection and elimination can be achieved. The limit of detection is determined to be 4.3 nM, which is comparable or even lower than existing methods. The distinguished performance may attribute to the high loading efficiency and magnetic enrichment of nanoparticles. Besides, this efficient strategy is resistant to interfering substances, thus realizing sensitive cholesterol detection in real sample. Simultaneously, the bifunctional magnetic nanoparticles also have up to 95% cholesterol elimination efficiency, which is higher than previous reported methods. Furthermore, the nanoparticles are turned out to be reusable within 5 times without noticeable loss in cholesterol elimination efficiency. Therefore, the bifunctional magnetic nanoparticles fabricated here could hold great potential for simultaneous cholesterol detection and elimination in practical applications.

AB Digital polymerase chain reaction (dPCR) circumventing the external calibration and potentially providing absolute quantification of nucleic acids has become an increasingly popular manifestation of PCR in biological researches However, currently reported or commercial dPCR devices are not suitable for applications in laboratories or zones with limited infrastructures, due to low function integration, cost-inefficiency, or weak mobility. Herein, in order to enable accurate DNA quantitative analysis in such situations, we have developed a smartphone-based mobile dPCR device integrated with thermal cycling control, on-chip dPCR, data acquisition, and result analysis. All the function units are automatically controlled using a customized Android software. The device is approximately 90 mm x 90 mm x 100 mm in size and about 500 g in weight, only costing about 320 dollars except the smartphone. Coupled with the self-priming dPCR chip previously developed by our lab, the device is able to accurately quantify down to 10 copies of the human 18 S ribosomal DNA fragment inserted in a plasmid. Comparing to the commercial QuantStudio (TM) 3D dPCR platform, our device achieves a comparable analytical accuracy. Besides, our device is capable of detecting single molecule of cancer biomarker gene CD147 in a low number of HepG2 cells. Therefore, our dPCR device as a low-cost, potable, and robust tool for highly accurate DNA quantitative analysis has a great potential in Point-of-care (POC) applications.

AB Green, simple and quick melamine sensing assays for highly efficient detection of melamine down to nM level have been reported. Biopolyphenols (rutin & curcumin) were used as reducing and stabilizing agents for the synthesis of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs). The synthesis of AgNPs was confirmed by FTIR, UV-Visible, XRD and HRTEM-EDS analysis. The biopolyphenols reduced AgNPs were well dispersed and spherical in shape. However, the presence of melamine in the reaction medium disrupted their synthesis. This may be attributed to interaction of melamine with Ag+ ions and biopolyphenols. At low concentration of melamine, pale red colored solution was obtained owing to formation of aggregated mass of AgNPs, whereas, at high concentration of melamine, colorless solution was obtained indicating disruption in synthesis of AgNPs. The presented protocol was proposed in light of optical responses, UV Visible plots and HRTEM-EDS analysis. Using the sensor assays, good limit of detection, 0.01 ppm (79 nM) and 0.24 ppm (1900 nM) by Ag-Rutin and Ag-Curcumin respectively, were obtained. The detection limits offered by both sensing assays were quite lower than safety level recommended by regulatory bodies (20 mu M in the USA and EU, 8 mu M for infant formula in China). The sensing assays displayed good selectivity as well as sensitivity. The proposed sensor was successfully deployed for detection of melamine in raw milk samples.

AB Recently, highly stretchable and flexible electrodes essential for wearable electronic devices has been reported. However, their electrical resistances are high, the fabrication processes are complicated and involve a high cost, and deformations such as stretching can lead to the degradation on electrical performance. To address these issues, a novel fabrication process (both inexpensive and simple) for the highly stretchable and conductive electrodes using well patterned 3D porous laser-induced graphene silver nanocomposite was developed. The fabricated electrode exhibited a high, uniform electrical conductivity even under mechanical deformations. Addition of platinum and gold nanoparticles (PtAuNP) on the 3D porous LIG greatly improved the electro-chemical performance for wearable glucose sensor applications. The fabricated glucose sensor exhibited low detection limit (5 mu M), and acceptable detection range from 0 to 1.1 mM (covers the glucose range in sweat), and high linearity (0.99). In addition, the fabricated pH sensor also exhibited a linear response (66 mV/pH) at the range from 4 to 7. This work successfully demonstrates the potential of this novel fabrication technique and stretchable LIG metal nanocomposite for wearable electrochemical-physiological hybrid biosensors.

AB An electrochemical biosensor based on Cu2+ -dependent cleavage DNAzyme (cDNAzyme), Exponential Amplification Reaction (EXPAR), and single-strand triggered DNA hybridization chain reaction (HCR) was developed for detecting the copper (II) ions. This method capitalizes on the specific recognition of cDNAzyme, the single strand accumulated isothermal amplification of EXPAR, and the enzyme-free isothermal DNA assembly of HCR. In the presence of Cu2+, the catalytic chain of cDNAzyme split the substrate chain to produce single-stranded DNA (Oligo X). With the help of the EXPAR, the trace Oligo X was amplified and converted to the initiator DNA (Oligo Y). After adding the initiator DNA (Oligo Y) into nanochannel, massive DNA superstructures grew from the capture probe (CP) that were pre-immobilized on the nanochannel wall, resulting in a sharp decrease of the effective diameter of the nanochannel. As a result, the transmembrane ionic current significantly decreased due to the effective closing of the nanochannel. Finally, the copper (II) ion was detected by monitoring the changes of transmembrane ionic current. The developed electrochemical biosensor also displayed high selectivity for Cu2+, which could be useful for monitoring Cu2+ above ten picomole.

AB Organic-inorganic hybrid nanoflowers (HNFs) are a class of flower-like hybrid materials self-assembled from metal ions and organic components, such as enzymes, antibodies, DNA and amino acids et al. Based on their properties of enhanced enzyme activity, stability, facile synthesis and excellent biocompatibility, HNFs enable them to be a highly versatile platform for latent applications in many realms, such as biological sensing, biomimetic catalyst, dye decolorization and support nanomaterials, etc. Compared with free enzymes, HNFs are potentially advantageous for biological applications owing to their enhanced catalytic ability and powerful load capacity. Herein, an overview of recent developments achieved in HNFs biosensing, including electrochemical biosensors, colorimetric biosensors, and point-of-care diagnostic devices, is provided. We summarized the preparation of different HNFs based on the type of metal ions and biomolecules used. The signal tags involved in the all-in-one hybrid nanoflowers are particularly emphasized. The challenges, future trends, and prospects associated with HNFs and their related materials for biosensing are also discussed.

AB The human skin is not only the largest organ, but also the most important candidate for novel non-invasive methods of investigation. Here we describe a large-scale prototype for determining the real-time distribution of the electrical activity from the surface of the human skin. A collection of 200 sensors have been placed across the entire trunk surface. The output of each sensor was remotely inserted into a 20 x 10 LED matrix for a parallel capture of the signals. Continuous observations of the electrical activity pattern were made above the LED matrix by a digital camera in an obscure environment. A total of 5.2 million measurements (25,920 maps) have been recorded as light intensities from the LED matrix and converted into percentages for evaluation. A total of 36 individuals were divided equally into two groups and subjected to a short glucose tolerance test for 1 h; one group with established Type 2 Diabetes (T2D) and the other group without diabetes. The electrical activity pattern and the average signal intensity of normal individuals (37% +/- 8.1) and diabetic individuals (58% +/- 7.8), showed a significant difference of 21%. The average signal intensity on the ventral side (VS) and dorsal side (DS) of the torso exhibited different behaviors in diabetics and non-diabetics. On average, diabetic individuals have shown an electrical activity of higher intensity on DS (DS = 60%, VS = 55%), while the normal group has shown a higher intensity on VS (DS = 36%, VS = 39%).

AB Fabrication of Molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) nanostructures and surface functionalization with noble metal nano particles is an emerging field of research as it has potential applications in electronic devices and chemical sensing. Here we report application of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) decorated MoS2 nanoflowers (Au-MoS2 NFs) as an efficient bio-sensor. MoS2 NFs, synthesized using green synthesis process, are further functionalized with AuNPs to tune their physical properties and make them more appropriate for biological applications. The abundant 'hot-spots' created by AuNPs through localization of electromagnetic field endows the Au-MoS2 hybrid structure as an excellent substrate for biochemical sensing through surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS). The sensing efficiency of the SERS substrate is examined using Rh6G as probe molecule with concentration as low as 10(-12) M. Main emphasis is given in detecting free bilirubin, an important component of human blood, using SERS technique. Au-MoS2 NF SERS substrate exhibits high sensitivity, stability and excellent reproducibility in sensing bilirubin from high level (10(-3) M) to picomolar level. The concentration (C) dependent SERS intensity (I) is found to follow the general relationship I = C-a, with a ranging from 0.09 to 0.12. The substrate shows excellent selectivity and reliability while sensing of free bilirubin performed in human serum in the presence of crucial interferences such as dextrose, cholesterol and phosphate. In the present study, this Au-MoS2 hybrid offers a new potential biosensing technology for free bilirubin detection and is anticipated to be applied for clinic diagnosis.

AB Molecular imprinting is an efficient technology to create artificial receptors with antibody-like binding properties for a variety of applications such as separation and sensing. In this work, a new sensing method was introduced by combining a two-dimensional molecularly imprinted polymer (2D-MIP) film with copper oxide nanoparticles (CuO NPs) labeling for signal conversion and amplification. CuO labeling can effectively monitor the thickness of 2D-MIPs to achieve the best imprinting effect. Trypsin imprinted polymer based electrochemical sensor on 96-well microplates was constructed and a good dynamic response was observed in the range of 0.5-500 ng/mL. Furthermore, detections of trypsin in fetal bovine serum were demonstrated using the imprinted polymer thin films. Our electrochemical sensors possess an excellent specificity, fast kinetics, high sensitivity and low cost, which have great potential in biological analysis.

AB The Systematic Evolution Ligands by Exponential Enrichment (SELEX) is common used for selection of high affinity single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) aptamer with target protein. However, we do not know what the most stable configuration of the selected aptamer bound with target protein is. Therefore, a systematic search process using the stochastic tunneling-basin hopping (STUN-BH) method is proposed to find the most stable configuration of the ssDNA aptamer specific for vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) capture (Apt(VEGF); 5'-TGT GGGGGTGGACGGGCCGGGTAGA-3'). After the most stable configuration was obtained by the STUN-BH method, molecular dynamics (MD) simulation was carried out to investigate the thermal stability of Apt(VEGF)/VEGF at 300 K in both vacuum and water. All molecular simulations were conducted with the large-scale atomic/molecular massively parallel simulator (LAMMPS), and the AMBER99SB force field was used to describe the atomic interactions for the current Apt(VEGF)/VEGF system. The three most stable Apt(VEGF)/VEGF configurations obtained by the STUN-BH method indicated that AptvEGF residues exhibit greater affinity for VEGF surface loop fragments as compared with surface alpha helix and beta sheet fragments. Results indicated that after the first Apt(VEGF) (Apt(VEGF) I) occupies most of the VEGF loop fragment, the second Apt(VEGF) (Apt (VEGF) II) is adsorbed by the rest of the VEGF loop fragment and the VEGF Chain B beta sheet fragment, resulting in a 24.8% reduction in binding strength as compared to that of Apt(VEGF) I. Furthermore, when Apt(VEGF) I and Apt(VEGF) II chains were stably adsorbed by VEGF, the third Apt(VEGF) (Apt(VEGF) III) chain can only partially attach to VEGF, as confirmed by real Apt(VEGF)-VEGF binding experiments. Lastly, we demonstrated that the aptasensor constructed according to MD simulation is highly. sensitive for VEGF with a linear detection range of 10 pg/mL-10 ng/mL.

AB In this study, a photoelectrochemical (PEC) biosensor was constructed by depositing supercapacitor carbon nanotubes (CNT) and Co3O4 onto the anatase TiO2 coated ITO electrodes. Herein, supercapacitor Co3O4 was employed as a semiconductor with a band gap of similar to 2.07 eV, and the supercapacitor behavior of the PEC system was improved by introducing CNT into the electrode material. Furthermore, a self-empowering glucose biosensor operating at 0 V was constructed for the first time. Also, upon the formation of p-n junction, Co3O4 was rendered electron accepting material, unlike its usual use in photocatalytic systems. Co3O4-CNT-anatase TiO2 semiconductor hybrid was used to reduce recombination of exited electrons, and increasing the visible light absorption. Prior to enzyme immobilization, CNT containing electrode material was modified with 1-pyrene boronic acid via pi-pi interactions. The enzyme immobilization was carried out through covalent esterification between the boronic acid moiety and the carbohydrate part of GOx. Enzyme immobilization way enabled the close contact between FAD and electrode material, and the electron donor FADH(2) forming after the enzymatic reaction can give electrons to the photogenerated holes of Co3O4 through CNT along with H2O2 by enhancing the photocurrent. The obtained PEC biosensor demonstrated acceptable reproducibility and decent stability with a linear measurement range of 0-4 mM, a sensitivity of 0.3 mu A mM(-1) cm(-2), and lower detection limit of 0.16 mu M. Thus, a self-powered biosensor was constructed by combining the PEC, and supercapacitor behavior of Co3O4 for the first time, and the utilization of the present PEC material can be extended to the other analytes detection through photoelectrochemistry. The supercapacitor materials led to the high current at direct electron transfer potential range, and this phenomenon implies that the PEC electrode can also be used in biofuel cells to obtain high power.

AB Protein kinases play a critical role in regulation of intracellular signal transduction, whose aberrant expression is closely associated with various dangerous human diseases. In this paper, we propose a feasible electrochemical assay of intracellular kinase by incorporating peptide nanoprobe-assisted signal labeling and signal amplification. Protein kinase A (PKA)-specific peptide P1 is self-assembled on the surface of a gold electrode, serine of which could be phosphorylated with catalysis of PKA in the presence of adenosine-5'-triphosphate (ATP). Another artificial peptide P2 contains a short template for preparation of copper nanoparticles-based nanoprobe (P2-CuNPs) and provides arginine residues for specific recognition of phosphorylation site. After PICA-catalyzed phosphorylation, phosphorylated P1 specially binds with P2-CuNPs through ultra-stable phosphate-guanidine interaction, and thus results in amplified electrochemical response from surface-attached CuNPs. Our method demonstrates a satisfactory sensitivity toward PICA detection with a detection limit of 0.0019 U/mL, which is also successfully applied in intracellular PKA assay and inhibitory study with high specificity comparable to ELISA. Therefore, the facile method suggests a promising potential use in kinase-related biochemical fundamental research, disease diagnosis and drug discovery in the future.

AB Ascorbic acid, dopamine, and uric acid are important electroactive biomolecules for health monitoring and they coexist in serum or urine. Their quantitative determination by electrochemistry could provide the accurate reference for diseases diagnosis and treatment. However, the traditional electrochemical workstations are too large for on-field inspection. Hence, the design of handheld electrochemical system for the detection of biomolecules is significant for point-of-care testing (POCT). In this paper, a smartphone-based integrated voltammetry system using modified electrode was developed for simultaneous detection of biomolecules. The system contained a disposable sensor, a coin-size detector, and a smartphone equipped with application program. Screen-printed electrodes were used as sensors for the detection, on which reduced graphene oxide and gold nanoparticles were electrochemically deposited by the system. The detector was used with voltammetric methods, in which excitation voltage was applied on the sensors and subsequent current responses were detected. The smartphone is the core component to communicate with the detector, calculate data, and plot voltammograms in real-time. Then, the system was applied to detect standard solutions of the biomolecules and their mixtures as examples. The results showed that the peak currents of each substance increased with higher concentration and the method allowed the discrimination of the different potentials of the studied species. Finally, the practical applications of the system were tested through detections of the biomolecules in artificial urine. The results exhibited that the system could be used to detect electrochemical activity of biomolecules with linear, high sensitivity, and specific responses in point-of-care testing.

AB Novel cathodic photoelectrochemical (PEC) aptasensors for sensitive and selective determination of thrombin and Pb2+ were developed based on a new dual-signal amplification strategy. The presence of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) could quench the PEC signal of bismuth oxyiodide (BiOI). At the same time, the redox moiety G-quadruplex/hemin or ferrocene (Fc) was found to enhance the PEC signal of BiOI. So, in the presence of thrombin or Pb2+, the interaction between target and the aptamer resulted in the releasement of the AuNPs, as well as shorter distance between the redox moiety and the electrode surface. Hence dual-enhanced cathodic PEC biosensor strategy was realized. Under the optimized conditions, the detection limits of thrombin and Pb2+ were 17.3 fM and 3.16 pM, respectively with good selectivity. At the same time, the PEC performance of redox moiety G-quadruplex/hemin and Fc was compared.

AB It is of significant importance to simultaneously shorten the start-up time and enhance the electricity generation performance for practical application of microbial fuel cell (MFC). In this paper, the polydiallyldimethylammonium chloride (PDDA) modified carbon felt (PDDA-CF) electrode was prepared and used as the anode of PDDA-MFC. The anode significantly enhanced the start-up speed and electricity generation and dye wastewater degradation performances of the PDDA-MFC. The start-up time of PDDA-MFC is only 9 h, which is only 7.5% that of the unmodified carbon felt anode MFC (CF-MFC). The charge transfer resistance, the maximum output voltage and the maximum output power density of PDDA-MFC were 9.7 Omega, 741 mV and 537.8 mW(-2) respectively, which were 70.3% lower than, 1.7 times and 3.3 times greater than those of CF-MFC respectively. In addition, the color and chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal rates of Reactive Brilliant Red X-3B for PDDA-MFC reached 95.94% and 64.24% at 24 h respectively, which were 41.5% and 51.2% higher than those of CF-MFC respectively. Due to the electrostatic attraction of PDDA, the adhesion and metabolic mass transfer rate of exoelectrogens are accelerated, thus the PDDA-CF electrode has excellent electrochemical properties and bioaffinity. This paper provides a new idea to enhance the start-up speed and performance of MFC simultaneously.

AB As a direct, label-free method, Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) detection significantly reduces the needs for liquid handling and reagent storage compared to common enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs), thus enabling comprehensive multiplexing of bioassays on microfluidic sample-to-answer systems. This paper describes a highly integrated centrifugal Lab-on-a-Disc (LoaD) platform for automating the full process chain extending between plasma extraction and subsequent aliquoting to five parallelized reaction channels for quantitative SPR detection by an inexpensive smartphone camera. The entire, multi-step / multi-reagent operation completes within less than 1 h. While the emphasis of this work is on the fluidic automation and parallelization by previously introduced, very robust event-triggered valving and buoyancy-driven centripetal pumping schemes, we successfully implement an immunoglobulin G (IgG) assay; by specific functionalization of the detection surfaces, the same disc layout can readily be customised for immunoassays panels from whole blood.

AB Combined power generation and waste degradation through microbial fuel cell (MFC) technology is emerging as an attractive solution for controlling pollution in water bodies. Cyanobacteria as fuel cell catalysts for such shared energy activities are not well studied even though these possess robust metabolic systems supporting exoelectrogenicity, biodegradation of toxic compounds, and their survival under wide environmental conditions. Herein, a dual chambered (50 ml each) MFC assembled with Synechococcus sp. based bioanode and abiotic cathode for simultaneous power generation and Mordant orange dye degradation is reported. The anode was prepared by encrusting chemically synthesised magnetic nanoparticle (MNP) of size 8.4 +/- 0.2 nm with magnetization of 69 emu g(-1 )on Toray carbon paper (TCP). The MNPs were encapsulated with aniline and pyrrole composite polymers to facilitate biofilm formation and cellular electron flow to the anode as confirmed by advance microscopic and voltametric techniques, respectively. The MFC with the dye mixed acetate produced current of 14.04 +/- 5.5 A m(-3) with a maximum power density of 4.9 +/- 0.5 W m(-3) (at cell voltage of 0.494 +/- 0.05 V), which was 18% higher than the control (without dye). The MFC produced a high OCP of 0.949 +/- 0.07 V and offered to decolorize 68.5% and degrade 89% of the dye following 216 h of its operation as confirmed by photometry (lambda(385 nm)) and LC-MS/MS analyses, respectively. The efficient dye degradation is attributed to the bioanode for secreting high level of reactive oxygen species. The composite polymer coated MNPs anode with cyanobacterial biofilm is therefore, a highly efficient construct for enhanced azo dye degradation and associated power generation in a MFC system.

AB We have developed a non-invasive rapid and real-time red blood cell (RBC) hemolysis detection method which is a more accurate for point of care testing of hemolysis in various medical settings. An eight-parameter equivalent circuit is employed to quantify the release of hemoglobin (H-b) and the cytoplasm from RBC into the blood plasma. RBC hemolysis is induced by adding different volume fractions of distilled water into the blood. The cytoplasm released following RBC hemolysis is estimated from the experimental values. A strong relationship between RBC hemolysis and change in the electrical characteristics of blood has been demonstrated. The cytoplasm resistance (R-c) shows a linear relationship with the H-b. This relationship between R-c and H-b is described by the equation R-c = 0.2203H(b) + 2.4775, with a correlation coefficient of 0.9905.

AB Cyanobacteria produce toxins such as microcystin-LR (MC-LR), which are associated with potential hepatotoxicity in humans. The detection of cyanobacteria and their toxins in drinking water and sea food is therefore crucial. To date, methods such as high performance liquid chromatography (I-IPLC), protein phosphatase inhibition assay (PPIA), and Raman spectroscopy have been employed to monitor MC-LR levels. Although these techniques are precise and sensitive, they require expensive instrumentation, well-trained personnel and involve time-consuming processes meaning that their application is generally limited to well-resourced, centralised laboratory facilities. Among the emerging MC-LR detection methods, aptasensors have received great attention because of their remarkable sensitivity, selectivity, and simplicity. Aptamers, also known as "chemical" or "artificial antibodies", serve as the recognition moieties in aptasensors. This review explores the current state-of-the-art of MC-LR aptasensor platforms, evaluating the advantages and, limitations of typical transduction technologies to identify the most efficient detection system for the potentially harmful cyanobacteria associated toxin.

AB Antioxidant evaluation of bioactive compounds is limited, since many methods lack a real physiological environment that can be used conveniently and intuitively. In this study, a simple, label-free and effective electrochemical biosensor method has been developed to evaluate the antioxidant effect of phloretin (Ph) by 3D cell modification on a glassy carbon electrode (GCE). In response to this, A549 cells were immobilized onto a self-assembled L-cysteine/gold nanoparticle (AuNPs/L-Cys)-modified GCE surface by a simple drop casting after encapsulated in alginate. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) results showed that the impedance value (R-et) increased with the concentration of H2O2 in the range of 0-60 mu mol/L with the correlation of 0.990 which acted as an oxidative stress model inducer. However, the EIS value decreased with the co-incubation of Ph ranging from 10 to 100 mu mol/L, showing a dose-dependent manner and time effect, indicating that the variation of Ret, was responded to the antioxidant effect. The response impedance of the biosensor is linear to Ph concentrations from 20 mu mol/L to 100 mu mol/L with the detection limit (LOD) as 1.96 mu mol/L. A significant correlation was observed between reactive oxygen species (ROS) values and R-et values following the concentrations of Ph, thus demonstrating the good biological relevance of cell-based electrochemical method. The strategy has been used to evaluate Ph antioxidant capacity in real cells with satisfactory results, indicating the feasibility of biosensor analysis for antioxidant evaluation.

AB The simultaneous detection of multiple biomarkers plays an important role in the accurate diagnosis of cancer. In this study, we developed a novel, surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS)-based microfluidic device for the simultaneous detection of free prostate-specific antigen (f-PSA) and total PSA (t-PSA) markers. A fully automatic droplet-based microfluidic platform for the rapid and sensitive detection of f-PSA and t-PSA was designed. Magnetic immunocomplexes were aligned on one side of the channel using a permanent magnet embedded in the microfluidic device, and parent microdroplets containing magnetic immunocomplexes and supernatant solutions were split into two smaller daughter droplets at the Y-shaped junction of the channel. Then, Raman signals of sequential droplets including supernatant solutions were measured for the quantitative analysis of the PSA markers. Two parallel microfluidic channels were designed and fabricated for the simultaneous detection of f-PSA and t-PSA. Our results showed a good linear response for both PSA markers in the range from 0.05 to 100 ng mL(-1). The limits of detection were estimated to be below 0.1 ng mL(-1) for both the f-PSA and t-PSA. This SERS-based assay in a microfluidic channel was completed in 10 min without any manual incubation and washing steps.

AB A three-dimensional hierarchical nanohybrid based on Cu-Au bimetallic nanocrystals integrated carbon nanotube arrays vertically grown on carbon spheres was successfully developed as an active platform for sensing application. Such nanohybrid can provide abundant active sites and act as an exceptional platform for immobilizing highly dense and well-dispersed carcinoembryonic antibody (anti-CEA) to sensitively detect CEA, an emerging biomarker of various cancer diseases. Due to the unique nanoarchitecture with altered electronic structure of Cu-Au bimetallic catalyst and enhanced interactions between components, such nanohybrid based biosensor demonstrated excellent electrochemical performance towards CEA detection with great sensitivity, wide linear detection range (0.025-25 ng/mL), very low limit of detection (0.5 pg/mL), and good selectivity. The results imply that this sensor has great potential to offer essential information for cancer diagnosis and management with great clinical importance.

AB Selective and efficient detection and imaging of nitroreductase (NTR) overexpressed in hypoxic tissues is of great importance for better understanding its biological functions. The effective optical probes equipped for NTR detection in vivo is still lacking, so we developed an innovative near infrared (NIR) fluorescent on-off probe (CyNO2) composed of fluorescence reporting unit (an aminocyaine dye) and recognition unit (p-nitrobenzylcarbamate group). The response and mechanism of the NTR activated reduction of Cy-NO2 were evaluated in vitro through kinetic optical studies, mass spectra analysis and docking calculations. The results demonstrated that Cy-NO2 could rapidly recognize NTR with high selectivity and sensitivity. The efficient NTR detection ability of Cy7-NO2 was further validated by fluorescence imaging of hypoxic cells (A549, PC-12 and HUVEC cell). Furthermore, the in vivo hypoxia imaging by Cy-NO2 were evaluated on tumor-bearing mouse, cerebral ischemia (CIS) and deep vein thrombosis models. The results indicated a rapid and distinct enhancement of its NIR fluorescence highly appropriate for in vivomonitoring of NTR in all of the three animal models, which revealed aspiring clinical value of this NIR fluorescent hypoxia probe.

AB Acenocoumarol (Sintromo (R)) is an oral anticoagulant prescribed for the treatment of a variety of thromboembolic disorders such as atrial fibrillation and thrombosis or embolism. It inhibits fibrin production preventing clot formation. Acenocoumarol has a narrow therapeutic range, and its effects depend on several factors, such as body weight, age, metabolism, diet, certain medical conditions or the intake of additional drugs, among others. A higher dose may result in the risk of bleeding, while if it is too low, the risk of blood clot can increase. Complementary tools that allow the therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) of acenocoumarol plasmatic levels from the starting of the treatment would be of paramount importance to personalize the treatment. Point-of-care (POC) devices can offer an added value in facilitating on-site monitoring (i.e. hospitals, primary care doctor or even by the patient itself) and can aid in dosage management. With this aim, we have developed a compact and simple nanoplasmonic sensing device based on gold nanodisks for the rapid monitoring of acenocoumarol, using highly specific polyclonal antibodies produced against this drug. A specific and reproducible label free indirect competitive assay has been developed and the viability of performing the evaluation directly in plasma diluted 1:1 has been demonstrated. A limit of detection (LOD) of only 0.77 +/- 0.69 nM, an IC50 of 48.2 +/- 5.12 nM and a dynamic range between 3.38 +/- 1.33 nM and 1154 +/- 437 nM were achieved, which easily fit within the drug plasma levels of acenocoumarol, making this approach a highly attractive option for its decentralized monitoring in human plasma.

AB Early diagnosis of cancers is critical for prevention of metastasis and early treatment. The study reports an electrochemical sensor for detection of cancer cell based on folic acid (FA) and octadecylamine (OA)-functionalized graphene aerogel microspheres (FA-GAM-OA). Citric acid was mixed with FA and OA and heated at 180 degrees C for 4 h to form FA and OA-functionalized graphene oxide. The graphene oxide was employed as solid particle surfactant for stabilizing toluene-in-water emulsion. The graphene oxide sheets in the emulsion were self-assembled into graphene oxide gel microspheres on the water/toluene interfaces. Followed by free drying and reduction in H-2 at 400 degrees C for 5 h. The resulted FA-GAM-OA shows a sphere-like structure with an average diameter of 1.2 mu m, the rich of open-pores and folic acid groups. Small particle size and good hydrophilicity make FA-GAM-OA can be dispersed in water for sensor preparation. The small size of graphene sheets and their self-assembly avoid a serious agglomeration of graphene sheets. The FA-GAM-OA offers a large surface area (1723.6 m(2) g(-1)) and high electronic conductivity (2978.2 S m(-1)). The covalent linkage and ordered alignment of folic acid groups at FA-GAM-OA surface achieve to specific cancer cell capture with high capture efficiency. The electrochemical sensor based on FA-GAM-OA exhibits extremely good analytical performances in detection of liver cancer cells with a linear range of 5-10(5) cell mL(-1) giving a low detection limit of 5 cells mL(-1) (S/N = 3). The method was successfully applied to electrochemical detection of liver cancer cells in whole blood.

AB Identification and quantitation of mephedrone as one of the popular new psychoactive substances (NPSs) in biological fluids is important. In this study, a novel electrochemical imprinted sensor was designed for ultrasensitive and selective measurement of mephedrone, based on sol-gel molecular imprinted polymer, polytyramine and functionalized multi-walled carbon nanotube@ gold nanoparticles (f-MWCNT@AuNPs) nanocomposite. The developed electrochemical sensor inherits characteristics of the gold and MWCNTs such as high electrical conductivity, large specific surface area and good biocompatibility. Also, tyramine as an additional monomer was used for fabrication of a strongly adhering film on the surface of the electrode. In the proposed method, the concentration of mephedrone was determined indirectly. The change in the current response of [Fe (CN)(6)](3-/4-) redox probe in the presence and absence of mephedrone molecules was used for indirect measurement of mephedrone molecule in solution. Density functional theory (DFT) was applied to better understanding the interactions between the mephedrone, sol-gel polymer and tyramine from molecular viewpoint. Under the optimized experimental conditions, the calibration curve of the designed sensor was plotted and two dynamic linear ranges from 1 to 10 nM and 10-100 nM with a limit of detection (LOD) as low as 0.8 nM (142 pg ml(-1)) were obtained. Finally, the fabricated sensor was successfully used to detect the mephedrone in biological samples.

Firstly, target microRNA-21 hybridized with hairpin H-2 to form H-2-T duplex stranded DNA (dsDNA), which could further open the hairpin H-1 for the formation of H-1-H-2 dsDNA. Simultaneously, the Fe3O4/CeO2@Au-S-1 not only hybridized with single stranded fragment of H-1-H-2 dsDNA with producing long dsDNA to absorb a large amount of electroactive substances of methylene blue (MB), but also acted as nanocatalyst to directly catalyze the reduction of MB for amplifying the electrochemical signal. Herein, compared with pure Fe3O4 nanoparticles, Fe3O4/CeO2@Au MNPs exhibited excellent catalytic performance since the cerium oxide (CeO2) nanoparticles and Au nanoparticles can greatly improve the catalytic activity of Fe3O4 nanoparticles and effectively prevent the agglomeration of Fe3O4 nanoparticles. Owing to the signal amplification strategy, the proposed biosensor provided a wide linear range of 1 fM to 1 nM with a low detection limit of 0.33 fM (defined as S/N = 3) for microRNA-21 detection, and exhibited excellent specificity and sensitivity. This strategy provided a novel avenue for the detection of other biomarkers in electrochemical biosensors.

AB The accurate and rapid detection of cardiac troponin I (cTnI) at an early stage can prevent people from getting acute myocardial infarction to a great extent. Here, an ultrasensitive sandwich-type electrochemical immunosensor for the quantitative detection of cTnI is designed based on a novel signal amplification strategy. Gold nanoparticles (Au NPs) doped covalent organic frameworks (COFs) and electron mediator toluidine blue (TB-Au-COFs) behave as labels for achieving signal amplification. Note that polypyrrole modified titanium dioxide nanoparticles (TiO2-PPy) with a high electronic conductivity and a large specific surface area can promote the performance of the immunosensor. For the immobilization of primary antibodies, Au NPs decorated TiO2 PPy (TiO2 -PPy-Au) is used as the substrate material to improve electron transfer. The proposed method exhibits a linear range from 0.5 pg(-1) to 10.0 ng mL(-1) and a low detection limit of 0.17 pg mL(-1) (S/N = 3). The immunosensor exhibits good stability, acceptable reproducibility and accuracy, indicating potential applications in clinical diagnostics.

AB DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) is the blueprint of life as it encodes all genetic information. In genetic disorder such as gene fusion, copy number variation (CNV) and single nucleotide polymorphism, DNA sequencing is used as the gold standard for successful diagnosis. Researchers have been conducting rigorous studies to achieve genome sequence at low cost while maintaining high accuracy and high throughput, as such sequencer devices have been developed which led to the evolvement of this technology. These devices are categorized into first, second, and third DNA sequencing generations. One successful endeavor for DNA sequencing is nanopore sequencing. This specific method is considered desirable due to its ability to achieve DNA sequencing while maintaining the required standards such as low cost, high accuracy, long read length, and high throughput. On the other hand, non-nanopore sequencing techniques require extensive preparation as well as complex algorithms, and are restricted by high cost, small throughput, and small read lengths. In this review, the concepts, history, advances, challenges, applications, and potentials of nanopore sequencing are discussed including techniques and materials used for nanopore production and DNA translocation speed control. Additionally, in light of the importance of the nanopore material configuration and fabrication, graphene which is a common and effective material will be discussed in the context of nanopore fabrication techniques. Finally, this review will shed light on some nanopore-related investigations in the area of molecular biology.

AB In this study, a novel electrochemical sensing strategy was developed based on nontarget-induced bridge assembly and aptamer (Apt) extension reaction triggered by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT). Bisphenol A (BPA) was chosen as the target analyte to study the analytical performance of the designed aptasensor. This sensing system takes advantages of electrochemical sensing platforms and detection of an ultra-low level of BPA, due to the formation of bridge on the surface of electrode in the absence of BPA. In the presence of BPA, Apt/BPA complex is formed and inhibits the access of TdT to the 3'-end of Apt, resulting in the lack of bridge assembly and high access of [Fe(CN)(6)](3-/4-) as redox agent to the electrode surface. Thus, a strong redox peak is observed. This aptasensor enabled the selective detection of BPA with the wide linear range of 0.08-15 nM and detection limit as low as 15 pM. Furthermore, the presented sensing platform was successfully applied for the detection of BPA in tap water and grape juice samples.

AB Human neutrophil elastase (HNE) is a serine protease, produced by polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs), whose uncontrolled production has been associated with various inflammatory disease states as well as tumour proliferation and metastasis. Here we report the development and characterisation of an electrochemical peptide-based biosensor, which enables the detection of clinically relevant levels of HNE. The sensing platform was characterised in terms of its analytical performance, enzymatic cleavage kinetics and cross-reactivity and applied to the quantitative detection of protease activity from PMNs from human blood.

AB The authors described a universal amperometric DNA biosensor for rapid and ultrasensitive detection of the specific IS6110 DNA sequence of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB). Surprisingly, when tufted carbon nanotubes (CNTs) doped with polyaniline (PAN), a unique flower-like structure with large surface area, abundant active groups and efficient redox activity was obtained. Accordingly, CNTs-PAN nanohybrid was designed both as novel redox nanoprobe and nanocarrier to decorate signal probe, forming tracer label for the generation and amplification of electrochemical signal. In addition, functionalized fullerene (C-60) nanoparticles (FC60) were employed as sensor platform to accelerate electron transfer and increase the loading of capture probe (CP). Moreover, enzyme-assisted target recycling amplification including three-way DNA junction could resolve the restriction of target sequences and make this method universal for other analytes. In the presence of target DNA, the assistant probe (AP), together with target DNA, could hybridize with CP and open its hairpin structure to form the Y-shaped junction and recognition sequence for nicking endonuclease. Once the CP was cleaved, the released AP and target DNA could hybridize with another CP to trigger the next cycle of cleavage, resulting in a large number of cleaved CP. After hybridization between cleaved CP and tracer label, a significantly enhanced electrochemical signal of CNTs-PAN could be easily read out. Based on the multiple signal amplification strategy, a wide detection linear range from 1 fM to 10 nM was obtained for target DNA of MTB. More importantly, the universal DNA biosensor also showed high specificity and sensitivity for MTB detection in clinical samples, which may provide a pragmatic tool for MTB testing and hold a great potential for other analytes.

AB Access to affordable and field deployable diagnostics are key barriers to the control and eradication of many endemic and emerging infectious diseases. While cost, accuracy, and usability have all improved in recent years, there remains a pressing need for even less expensive and more scalable technologies. To that end, we explored new methods to inexpensively produce and couple protein-based biosensing molecules (affinity reagents) with scalable electrochemical sensors. Previous whole-cell constructs resulted in confounding measurements in clinical testing due to significant cross-reactivity when probing for host-immune (antibody) response to infection. To address this, we developed two complimentary strategies based on either the release of surface displayed or secretion of fusion proteins. These dual affinity biosensing elements couple antibody recognition (using antigen) and sensor surface adhesion (using gold-binding peptide-GBP) to allow single-step reagent production, purification, and biosensor assembly. As a proof-of-concept, we developed Hepatitis C virus (HCV)-core antigen-GBP fusion proteins. These constructs were first tested and optimized for consistent surface adhesion then the assembled immunosensors were tested for cross-reactivity and evaluated for performance in vitro. We observed loss of function of the released reagents while secreted constructs performed well in in vitro testing with 2 orders of dynamic range, and a limit of detection of 32 nM. Finally, we validated the secreted platform with clinical isolates (n = 3) with statistically significant differentiation of positive vs. non-infected serum (p < 0.0001) demonstrating the ability to clearly distinguish HCV positive and negative clinical samples.

AB Biomaterials have gained increasing attention in the fabrication of a variety of flexible electronics due to their tunable solubility, robust mechanical property, multi-active binding sites, and excellent biocompatible and biodegradable characterization as well. Here, we review the recent progress of bio-based materials in flexible sensors, mainly describe nature biomaterials (silk fibroin, cellulose and chitin) and chemical-synthesized biomaterials as well as their applications in health monitors, biosensor, human-machine interactions (HMIs) and more, and highlight the current opportunities and challenges that lay ahead in mounting numbers of academia and industry. Furthermore, we expect this review could contribute to unveiling the potentials of developing outstanding and eco-friendly sensors with biomaterials by utilization of printing techniques.

AB There is a great need to track the selectivity of anticancer drug activity and to understand the mechanisms of associated biological activity. Here we focus our studies on the specific NQO1 bioactivatable drug, beta-lapachone, which is in several Phase I clinical trials to treat human non-small cell lung, pancreatic and breast cancers. Multielectrode chips with electrochemically-active DNA monolayers are used to track anticancer drug activity in cellular lysates and correlate cell death activity with DNA damage. Cells were prepared from the triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cell line, MDA-MB-231 (231) to be proficient or deficient in expression of the NAD(P) H:quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1) enzyme, which is overexpressed in most solid cancers and lacking in control healthy cells. Cells were lysed and added to chips, and the impact of beta-lapachone (beta-lap), an NQO1-dependent DNA-damaging drug, was tracked with DNA electrochemical signal changes arising from drug-induced DNA damage. Electrochemical DNA devices showed a 3.7-fold difference in the electrochemical responses in NQO1 + over NQO1- cell lysates, as well as 10-20-fold selectivity to catalase and dicoumarol controls that deactivate DNA damaging pathways. Concentration-dependence studies revealed that 1.4 mu M beta-lap correlated with the onset of cell death from viability assays and the midpoint of DNA damage on the chip, and 2.5 mu M beta-lap correlated with the midpoint of cell death and the saturation of DNA damage on the chip. Results indicate that these devices could inform therapeutic decisions for cancer treatment.

AB A CMOS-compatible ISFET with a Ta2O5 sensitive surface was developed. The structure was optimized for achieving high sensitivity using a subthreshold operation mode and by reducing the influence of the capacitances on the value of subthreshold swing. The developed ISFET was used as a basis for a biosensor for L-carnitine detection. To this end, carnitine acetyltransferase was immobilized on the ISFET sensitive surface. The immobilized enzyme was active (0.082 U/g (model plate)). The complete microsystem, consisting of a packaged chip, an immobilized enzyme and a microfluidic channel, detected L-carnitine at a range of 0.2-100 mu M with a LOD of 0.2 mu M. The biosensor response was linear in the range of 0.2-50 mu M of L-carnitine with sensitivity 18.0 +/- 1.7 mV/mu M. An experiment with artificial urine containing 1.3 mu M L-carnitine showed that the proposed biosensor could be used on a real sample. Therefore, a new sensor specially optimized for biosensing CMOS-compatible ISFET structures and direct determination of L-carnitine with immobilized carnitine acetyltransferase was developed.

AB Rapid identification of emerging infectious pathogens is crucial for preventing public health threats. Various pathogen detection techniques have been introduced; however, most techniques are time-consuming and lack multiple-target detection specificity. Although multiple-target detection techniques can distinguish emerging infectious pathogens from related pathogens, direct amplification methods have not been widely examined. Here, we present a novel arch-shaped multiple-target sensor capable of rapid pathogen identification using direct amplification in clinical samples. In this study, an arch-shaped amplification containing primer sequences was designed to rapidly amplify multiple targets. Further, the sensing platform allowed for sensitive and specific detection of human coronavirus, Middle East respiratory syndrome, Zika virus, and Ebola virus down to several copies. This platform also simultaneously distinguished between Middle East respiratory syndrome and human coronavirus in clinical specimens within 20 min. This arch-shaped multiple-target sensing assay can provide rapid, sensitive, and accurate diagnoses of emerging infectious diseases in clinical applications.

AB Understanding the enzymatic reaction kinetics of cytochrome P450 (CYP) within confined spaces is essential for the development of efficient CYP bioreactors in vitro. Herein, a facile electrochemical enzymatic nanoreactor (CYP3A4/PNGFs) is constructed by immobilizing CYP3A4 inside polydopamine (PDA) modified nanoporous graphene foams (PNGFs) whose pore diameter is controllable by the template of silica spheres. Taking advantages of the unique 3-D structure of NGFs and the ideal crosslinking agent of PDA, CYP3A4 is easily absorbed into PNGFs with high stability and bioactivity. Meanwhile, the enzymatic activity of CYP3A4 can be effectively regulated by changing the pore diameter of PNGFs. At the pore diameter of about 65 nm, CYP3A4 shows the highest affinity to testosterone with the Michaelis-Menten constant (K-m(app)) of 110.70 +/- 18 mu M and the relatively higher reaction rate with the I-max value of 11.85 +/- 1.20 nA, which is due to the maintained native configuration and larger amount of immobilized enzyme. Furthermore, the constructed CYP3A4/PNGF-1 nanoreactor is successfully applied to the metabolism of three steroid hormones (testosterone, estrone and progesterone), and the order of the calculated K-m(app) values is consistent with literature. The proposed enzymatic reactor provides a new strategy for the efficient imitation of the natural P450 metabolic pathway at low cost, and has potential applications in fast steroid hormone metabolism assays, drug development and toxicity screening.

AB We have investigated amplification-free in situ double-stranded mutation detection in urine in the concentration range 10(-19) M -10(-16) M using piezoelectric plate sensors (PEPS). The detection was carried out in a close-loop flow with two temperature zones. The 95 degrees C high-temperature zone served as the reservoir where the sample was loaded and DNA de-hybridized. The heated urine was cooled flowing through a 1 m long tubing immersed in room-temperature water bath at a flow rate of 4 ml/min to reach the detection cell at the desired temperature for the detection to take place. With hepatitis B virus double mutation (HBVDM) and KRAS G12V point mutation as model double mutations, it is shown that PEPS was able to detect double-stranded HBVDM and KRAS with 70% detection efficiency or better at concentration as low as 10(-19) M against single-stranded mutation detection at the same concentrations, which was validated by the following in situ fluorescent reporter microspheres (FRMs) detection as well as microscopic visualization of the FRMs bound to the captured mutant on the PEPS surface. Furthermore, the same double-stranded mutation detection efficacy was demonstrated at 10(-19) M -10(-16) in a background of 250-fold wildtype for HBVDM and 1000-fold wildtype for KRAS. Also demonstrated was detection of KRAS mutation at 10(-19) M -10(-16)of SW480 DNA fragments in urine.

AB Abnormal levels of guanine closely associated with plenty of diseases are usually used as a biomarker for clinical diagnosis. In order to detect guanine and its derivatives accurately, in this paper, a defective G-quadruplex (DGQ) containing a G-vacancy at one of its G-quartet layers, and two kinds of G-quadruplex specific indicators including thioflavine T (ThT) and hemin were used for constructing a fluorescent and an electrochemical biosensor, respectively. In brief, a G-rich DNA probe is designed to form either hairpin or DGQ structure. In the absence of guanine, G-rich probes prefer to maintain hairpin structure and nearly have no interaction with ThT or heroin, leading to almost negligible signals. Upon addition of guanine, the G-rich probe fold into DGQ structure and then the G-vacancy in it is filled up immediately by guanine via Hoogsteen hydrogen bonds, resulting canonical G-quadruplex formation. Accordingly, ThT or hemin can selectively combine with G-quadruplex, giving rise to distinct fluorescent or current signal changes for label-free detection of guanine. Benefiting from the perfect discriminative ability of guanine towards DGQ and ThT/hemin against standard G-quadruplex, the fluorescent and electrochemical biosensors present better sensitivity and selectivity for guanine detection with the limit of detection (LOD) as low as 18.26 and 0.36 nM, respectively. Successful attempts were also made in applying the proposed electrochemical biosensor to detect guanine in drugs and urine, obtaining satisfactory recovery rates of 99 similar to 104% and 96 similar to 106%, respectively.

AB Simple, fast and effective detection methods of Escherichia coli (E. coli) are essential for human life and health. This article proposes a sensitive and rapid detection method of E. coli based on electrochemical biosensor using 16 S rDNA as target biomarker, and using oligonucleotide probes and nanogap network electrodes as transducer elements. The nanogap network electrodes are prepared by interconnecting of gold nanoparticles through thiolated peptide nucleic acid (PNA) probes on the substrate of Au interdigital electrode. In the presence of specific 16 S rDNA fragments, PNA capture probe hybridized to 5' terminal of the fragments, and detection probe modified with horseradish peroxidase (HRP) hybridized to its 3' terminal. HRP attached to the hybridized detection probe catalyzed the polymerization of aniline along target chain. Conductive connection was caused by polyaniline deposition between the interrupted gold nanoparticles and offered a conductimetric response of constructed sensor. Thus, E. coli could be successfully detected with the detection limit of 100 CFU/mL. The detection time was less than 3 h. It would be widely used for rapid detection of E. coli.

AB We fabricated a composite of multi-walled carbon nanotube and polydimethylsiloxane and utilized it as an electrode for DNA sensing using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. Without any surface modification or probe immobilization, often necessary for other electrodes, this electrode also acts as a recognition layer for DNA via pi-pi interactions between the multi-walled carbon nanotube and DNA. This electrode is easily reusable via a simple cleansing process, because there are no covalently bonded adsorbates on the electrode. Compared to previous DNA detection based on differential pulse voltammetry using a similar electrode, the measurement time was reduced from 1 h to less than 30 min, and the limit of detection (25 pM) was reduced by a factor of more than five. In addition, our system can detect the single-base mismatch between the target and probe. Our results indicate that electrochemical impedance spectroscopy is promising for utilizing the multi-walled carbon nanotube and polydimethylsiloxane electrode as a DNA sensor.

AB Unmodified and multi-walled carbon nanotube (MWCNT) modified tetrahedral amorphous carbon (ta-C) films of 15 and 50 nm were investigated as potential in vivo sensor materials for the detection of dopamine (DA) in the presence of the main interferents, ascorbic acid (AA) and uric acid (UA). The MWCNTs were grown directly on ta-C by chemical vapor deposition (designated as ta-C + CNT) and were characterized with X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, scanning and transmission electron microscopy. Electroanalytical sensitivity and selectivity were determined with cyclic voltammetry. Biocompatibility of the materials was assessed with cell cultures of mouse neural stem cells (mNSCs). The detection limits of DA for both ta-C and ta-C + CNT electrodes ranged from 40 to 85 nM, which are well within the required range for in vivo detection. The detection limits were lower for both ta-C and ta-C + CNT electrodes with 50 nm of ta-C compared to 15 nm. The ta-C electrodes showed a large dynamic linear range of 0.01-100 mu M but could not resolve between the oxidation peaks of DA, AA and UA. Modification with MWCNTs, however, resulted in excellent selectivity and all three analytes could be detected simultaneously at physiologically relevant concentrations using cyclic voltammetry. Based on cell culture of mNSCs, both ta-C and ta-C + CNT exhibited good biocompatibility, demonstrating their potential as in vivo sensor materials for the detection of DA.

AB An ingenious and viable method for preparing heterogeneous Co3O4 dodecahedrons that contain carbon and encapsulated Au nanoparticles (Au@C-Co3O4) was proposed via pyrolysis of Au nanoparticle-encapsulated zeolitic imidazolate framework-67 (Au@ZIF-67). The obtained Au@C-Co3O4 possessed hierarchically porous structure, abundant active sites, excellent conductivity, and durability, all of which can significantly improve the analysis performance of the biosensor. Meanwhile, the fabricated electrode based on the porous Au@C-Co3O4 showed remarkable electrocatalytic performance towards H2O2 with a limit of detection of 19 nM and ultra-high sensitivity of 7553 mu A mM(-1)cm(-2), even when the Au content in the composite was as low as 0.85 wt%. This novel biosensor was successfully used to monitor H2O2 concentration released from living cells, and the results can be used to identify cancer cells, thus advancing the use of transition metal oxides in the field of biosensing.

AB In this work, a biomolecular calculation system was developed based on electrochemiluminescence (ECL) and fluorescence emission (FL) of luminol and cyclic voltammetry (CV) of ferrocene methanol (FMA). When triethylamine (TEA) was added in luminol solution as a coreactant, a great ECL peak at 1.1 V was observed. While the further addition of enzymatic system, esterase/ethyl butyrate (EB), would significantly lower the ECL response. On the other hand, TEA could quench the FL signal of luminol at 430 nm, while the injection of esterase/EB in the luminol solution could enhance the FL signal. Furthermore, FMA exhibited a CV peak pair at 0.2 V and could decrease the ECL signal greatly in the luminol/TEA solution. Based on these interesting results, a 3-input and 5-output biomolecular logic gate was established with TEA, FMA and esterase/EB as inputs and the ECL, CV and FL signals as outputs. Moreover, some nonarithmetic logic devices, such as an encoder, a decoder, a 3-input keypad lock and two dual transfer gates were elaborately designed on the same platform. This work presented a new example of how the complexity of biocomputing system could be enhanced either by increasing the number of outputs of traditional logic gates or by fabricating some nonarithmetic logic devices based on the same simple electrochemical system.

AB Molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs) can selectively bind target molecules and can therefore be advantageously used as a low-cost and robust alternative to replace fragile and expensive natural receptors. Yet, one major challenge in using MIPs for sensor development is the lack of simple and cost-effective techniques that allow firm fixation as well as controllable and consistent receptor material distribution on the sensor substrate. In this work, a convenient method is presented wherein microfluidic systems in conjunction with in situ photo-polymerization on functionalized diamond substrates are used. This novel strategy is simple, efficient, low-cost and less time consuming. Moreover, the approach ensures a tunable and consistent MIP material amount and distribution between different sensor substrates and thus a controllable active sensing surface. The obtained patterned MIP structures are successfully tested as a selective sensor platform to detect physiological concentrations of the hormone disruptor testosterone in buffer, urine and saliva using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The highest added testosterone concentration (500 nM) in buffer resulted in an impedance signal of 10.03 +/- 0.19% and the lowest concentration (0.5 nM) led to a measurable signal of 1.8 +/- 0.15% for the MIPs. With a detection limit of 0.5 nM, the MIP signals exhibited good linearity between a 0.5 nM and 20 nM concentration range. Apart from the excellent and selective recognition offered by these MIP structures, they are also stable during and after the dynamic sensor measurements. Additionally, the MIPs can be easily regenerated by a simple washing procedure and are successfully tested for their reusability.

AB Water pollution and habitat degradation are the cause of increasing water scarcity and decline in aquatic biodiversity. While the freshwater availability has been declining through past decades, water demand has continued to increase particularly in areas with arid and semi-arid climate. Monitoring of pollutants in wastewater effluents are critical to identifying water pollution area for treatment. Conventional detection methods are not effective in tracing multiple harmful components in wastewater due to their variability along different times and sources. Currently, the development of biosensing instruments attracted significant attention because of their high sensitivity, selectivity, reliability, simplicity, low-cost and real-time response. This paper provides a general overview on reported biosensors, which have been applied for the recognition of important organic chemicals, heavy metals, and microorganisms in dark waters. The significance and successes of nanotechnology in the field of biomolecular detection are also reviewed. The commercially available biosensors and their main challenges in wastewater monitoring are finally discussed.

AB Understanding the role of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) in electrochemiluminescence (ECL) processes of the Ru(bpy)(3)(2+) (bpy = 2, 2'-bipyridine)/tripropylamine (TPA) system would be beneficial to develop novel ECL sensors for a variety of applications. In this work, we found that the AuNPs on the surface of indium tin oxide (ITO) electrode could catalyze the electrochemical oxidation of TPA, greatly enhancing the ECL signal of Ru(bpy)(3)(2+)/TPA, present in the solution. If physical separation of AuNPs away from electrode surface after hybridization with target ssDNA, ECL signal decreased dramatically due to the loss of electrochemical activity of AuNPs, based on which a sensitive and specific DNA sensor in a "switch-off" mode was constructed with a detection limit of 0.2 pM. In addition, a suppressing effect of the AuNPs on the ECL of Ru(bpy)(3)(2+) was experimentally confirmed by decreasing the electrocatalytic effect to overall ECL emission, including selection of oxalate as a coreactant instead of TPA, or introduction of gold electrode as substrate. Furthermore, when Ru(bpy)(3)(2+) and AuNPs were both immobilized on the ITO electrode at close proximity, the ECL quenching induced by energy/electron transfer was predominant. ECL emission of the Ru(bpy)(3)(2+)/TPA system resulted from a competition between electrocatalytic enhancement and quenching effect. However, the quenched ECL signal would return in case of the AuNPs moving far away from ECL emitters after a hybridization reaction as before, and a separation distance dependent surface enhancement was observed as well. Based on the role change for AuNPs from quenching to enhancing ECL intensity of Ru(bpy)(3)(2+)/TPA system, a novel ECL DNA sensing strategy in a "turn-on" mode was developed, enabling quantitative analysis of target ssDNA over the range of 0.05 pM to 0.5 nM with a detection limit of 12 fM. Overall, we demonstrated the existence of three effects of AuNPs on the ECL of Ru(bpy)(3)(2+)/TPA system, and which played the leading role was dependent on the placement of AuNPs, Ru(bpy)(3)(2+), and their separation distance. The ECL sensors based on the role change for AuNPs showed both high sensitivity and excellent selectivity.

AB Herein, a doped graphene-like membrane was designed, which was copolymerized to be a solid ionic biosensor by using titania nanotubes (TiNTs), polyaniline (PANI), EvimCl (1-ethyl-3-vinylimidazolium chloride, EVIMC) and chloroauric acid (HAuCl4). The structure of graphene-like arrangement and the copolymerization mechanism of the film were discussed in detail. Because of the high catalytic property, Lactate could be determined on the membrane catalyzed by lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) containing isocitrate dehydrogenase (NAD(+)), which was immobilized onto the film by electrostatic attraction. The electrochemical response on the LDH/Au-EVIMC-TiNTs-PANI/ITO was increased by twice than the LDH/TiNTs/PANI/ITO, and exhibited two linear responses within the concentration range from 5.5 x 10(-7) M to 5.55 x 10(-6) M, and 5.55 x 10(-6) M to 3.33 x 10(-3) M, with a detection limit of 1.65 x 10(-7) M (S / N = 3). The interference study for other common coexistence such as uric acid and hemoglobin revealed that there was no overlapping signal for the detection of Lactate on the biosensor. The developed method proved the most stability in the determination of real blood samples, and the recoveries ranged from 96.7% to 105.8% with a satisfactory result.

AB The potential adverse effects of the environmental presence of antibiotics on the ecosystem demands the development of new methods suitable for accurate detection of these micropollutants in various aquatic media. An analytical method exploiting the synergistic effect of a label-free sensing platform combined with a molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP) as robust recognition element could represent an efficient tool for the real-time monitoring of antibiotics. In this work, a hybrid organic-inorganic MIP film (AMO-MIP) selective towards amoxicillin (AMO) was synthesized and integrated with a surface plasmon resonance (SPR) sensor. The film was prepared by sol-gel using methacrylamide (MAAM) as organic functional monomer, tetraethoxysilane (TEOS) as inorganic precursor, and vinyltrimethoxysilane (VTMOS) as coupling agent. The AMO-MIP film characterized with the SPR system demonstrated about 16 times higher binding capacity to AMO than corresponding reference non-imprinted polymer (NIP). AMO-MIP-modified SPR sensors could detect AMO with LoD down to 73 pM and discriminate AMO among structurally similar molecules both in buffer and in tap water. Good reproducibility was achieved for several rebinding-regeneration cycles. The sensor could be stored at room temperature for up to 6 months without losing stability.

AB Surface-Enhanced Raman Scattering (SERS) is used to differentiate two colon cancer cell line HCT 116, that is, to distinguish a TP53 gene knockout cell line (p53 -/-) from a wild type (p53 +/+). A label-free graphene/gold nanopyramid based SERS platform, combined with the multivariate analysis: principal component analysis, is used to profile live, dead, and burst colon cancer cells suspended in simulated body fluid (SBF). The graphene sheet permits SERS hotspot identification and provides a chemical enhancement for the biological constituents. This study found that a unique fingerprint exists for three different states of the cell, burst, live, and dead, which were used to differentiate the p53 +/+ and p53 -/- cell lines. Perceptron with Pocket Algorithm was also coupled with PCA to demonstrate an average of 81% sensitivity and 97% specificity in separating the two cell lines. The demonstration of single gene differentiation shows the great applicable potential of this SERS graphene hybrid platform for cancer diagnosis.

AB In this work, we designed a new strategy for ultrasensitive detection of CEA based on efficient electrochemiluminescence (ECL) quenching of Ru(bpy)(3)(2+)-doped SiO2 nanocomposite by ferrocene using target recycling amplification technique. A large number of Ru@SiO2 ECL signal probe were firstly assembled on the novel magnetic core - shell Fe3O4@Au nanoparticles (NPs), then the ferrocene-labeled ECL quenching probe (Fcprobe) was linked to the magnetic NPs. Finally, numerous DNA1 sequences were produced by target CEA-triggered multiple recycling amplification and displaced the Fc-probe on the magnetic NPs, leading to significantly enhanced ECL signal for CEA detection. Because of the designed cascade signal amplification strategy, the newly developed method achieved a wide linear range of 10 fg/mL to 10 ng/mL with a low detection limit of 3.5 fg/mL. Furthermore, taking advantages of the magnetic Fe3O4@Au NPs for caning abundant signal probes, sensing target and ECL detection, the developed ECL strategy is convenient, rapid and displayed high sensitivity for CEA detection, which has great potential for analyzing the clinical samples in practical disease diagnosis applications.

AB A highly sensitive and selective molecular imprinting polymer (MIP) sensor was fabricated based on polypyrrole (PPy)/ZIF-67/Nafion hybrid modified glassy carbon electrode (GCE) for the determination of dopamine (DA). The ZIF-67 material was facilely prepared by using hydrothermal synthesis method; subsequently, the PPy/ZIF-67/Nafion hybrid was obtained through a one-pot synthesis method. The physical properties of the materials and the modified sensors were investigated by using X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), Nitrogen adsorption-desorption isothermal (BET), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), Scanning electron microscope (SEM) and Atomic force microspectroscopy (AFM) apparatus. Cyclic voltammetry (CV), differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscope (EIS) were used to evaluate the electrochemical performance of the sensors. The influence factors controlling the performance of the MIP sensor were studied and included scan rate, pH value and scan cycles. Under optimal conditions, DPV peak was linearly related to DA concentration over two concentration intervals (0.08-100 mu M and 100-500 mu M). The detection limit of PPy/ZIF-67-MIPs/Nafion/GCE sensor for DA was 0.0308 mu M (S/N = 3) and sensitivity was equal to 1.656 mu A mu M cm(-2). Furthermore, good reproducibility, long-term stability and favorable selectivity were obtained in the experiment. Moreover, the fabricated MIP sensor was successfully applied in the determination of DA concentrations in injection and human serum samples with satisfactory recoveries.

AB Various methods have been introduced to detect amphenicols in biological samples. However, because of some problems involved in conventional methods, such as time-consuming processes, expensive equipment, and high consumption of reagents, novel strategies for the detection and quantitative determination of amphenicols are required. Aptamer-based biosensors with unique recognition features have gained much attention because of their rapid response, high specificity, and simple fabrication. In this study, we summarized the optical and electrochemical amphenicol aptasensors with a focus on the recent advancements and modern approaches in amphenicol aptasensors to provide readers with an inclusive understanding of their improvement.

AB Signal-amplified ratiometric electrochemiluminescence (Sa-RECL) provides an attractive approach to maximize signal-to-noise ratio through enhancing signals and eliminate interferences. In this work, we prepared a novel metal-organic framework (MOF)/Au/G-quadruplex as both quenchers and enhancers to fabricate a target-triggered ratiometric ECL sensor for high sensitive and accurate detection of prostatic specific antigen (PSA). The ratiometric ECL sensor using the dual-potential-dependent ECL emitters (quantum dots (QDs) and luminol) and MOF/Au/G-quadruplex not only achieved signal self-calibration but also realized cooperative amplification. After the sequential hybridization among of complementary DNA-QDs, PSA aptamer and pDNA-Au-Hemin-MIL-DNAzyme and the further competition of PSA, the pDNA-Au-Hemin-MIL-DNAzyme probe would keep away from the electrode surface, causing a switchover of their ECL signals from "off-on" state to "on-off" state. The ratiometric ECL aptasensor exhibits high-sensitive and accurate analytical performance toward PSA with a linear detection range from 0.5 to 500 ng mL(-1) and a detection limit of 0.058 ng mL(-1) (S/N = 3). The novel ratiometric ECL biosensor has been successfully applied to determine different serum samples of PSA, indicating its potential application in the clinical diagnosis.

AB A novel pH-responsive sandwich-type electrochemiluminescence immunosensor was successfully developed for the detection of avian leukosis virus subgroup J (ALV-J). The immunosensor consisted of graphene oxide functionalized with tannic acid (rGO-TA) and primary antibodies (Ab(1)) as the main ALV-J sensing platform. For signal amplification, pH-responsive hollow MnO2 (hMnO(2)) nanospheres encapsulating Ru(bpy)(3)Cl-2 and carrying secondary antibodies (Ab(2)) were employed. Under optimal conditions, the immunosensor exhibited a wide ALV-J detection range of 10(1.80) to 10(4.30 )TCID(50)/mL (TCID50: 50% tissue culture infective dose) and a low detection limit of 10(1.71) TCID50/mL (S/N = 3). Importantly, the immunosensor showed high sensitivity, good reproducibility and excellent operational stability. Finally, the immunosensor was evaluated using a real avian serum sample containing ALV-J, with excellent results being achieved.

AB In the paper, a triple-amplified biosensor was built for the purpose of ultrasensitive methyltransferase (Dam MTase) activity detection and inhibitor screening based on in-situ synthesized silver nanoclusters (AgNCs) as signal probes to provide amplified current signal coupling with gold nanoparticles/electrochemical reduced graphene oxide (AuNPs/ERGO) hybrids and hybridization chain reactions (HCR) amplification strategy. For biosensor preparation, the AuNPs/ERGO hybrids were firstly generated on the electrode surface by electrochemical co-reduction method, then the ds-DNA structures which comprised the specific recognition sequences (5'-G-A-T-C-3') of the Dam MTase and the restrictive endonuclease DpnI were formed on the electrode by the hybridization of the assistant DNA with the capture DNA. The presence of Dam MTase methylated partial ds-DNA structures on the electrode which could be digested by DpnI and could not undergo HCR process. The unmethylated ds-DNA structures underwent HCR process to further hybridize with DNA1 and DNA2 to form dsDNA superstructures as effective template for AgNCs in-situ synthesis. Oxidation peak current of silver was obtained as signal output for Dam MTase detection. Integrated synthesis and detection in one as well as combined metal nanocluster with DNA superstructures, this biosensor showed a good performance for Dam MTase activity detection with a detection limit of 0.0073 U/mL. Compared with reported biosensor, the designed biosensor showed high sensitivity and had potential in clinical diagnosis as well as inhibitor screening.

AB The electrochemical detection of methyl parathion in fish was performed by preconcentrating the pesticide on magnetic molecularly imprinted polymer and further readout on magneto-actuated electrode by square wave voltammetry. The magnetic molecularly imprinted polymer was synthesized by a magnetic core-shell strategy, using methacrylic acid as a functional monomer, and selected by theoretical calculation using the density functional theory (DFT). The characterization of this material was performed by SEM, TEM and XRD. Moreover, the binding capacity and selectivity towards methyl parathion was studied and compared with the corresponding magnetic non-imprinted polymer. The magneto-actuated electrochemical sensor showed outstanding analytical performance for the detection of methyl parathion in fish, with a limit of detection of as low as 1.22 x 10(-6) mg L-1 and recovery values ranging from 89.4% to 94.7%. The magnetic molecularly imprinted polymer successfully preconcentrated the analyte from the complex samples and paves the way to incorporate this material in other platforms for the detection of this pesticide in the field of environmental control and food safety.

AB Neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) is an enzyme responsible for catalyzing the production of the crucial cellular signalling molecule, nitric oxide (NO), through its interaction with the PDZ domain of alpha-syntrophin protein. In this study, a novel light-driven photoswitchable peptide-based biosensor, modelled on the nNOS beta-finger, is used to detect and control its interaction with alpha-syntrophin. An azobenzene photoswitch incorporated into the peptide backbone allows reversible switching between a trans photostationary state devoid of secondary structure, and a cis photostationary state possessing a well-defined antiparallel beta-strand geometry, as revealed by molecular modelling. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) is used to successfully detect the interaction between the gold electrode bound peptide in its cis photostationary state and a wide range of concentrations of alpha-syntrophin protein, highlighting both the qualitative and quantitative properties of the sensor. Furthermore, EIS demonstrates that the probe in its random trans photostationary state does not bind to the target protein. The effectiveness of the biosensor is further endorsed by the high thermal stability of the photostationary state of the cis-isomer, and the ability to actively control biomolecular interactions using light. This approach allows detection and control of binding to yield a regenerable on-off biosensor.

AB In nature, different types of bacteria including pathogenic and beneficial ones exist in different habitats including environment, plants, animals, and humans. Among these, the pathogenic bacteria should be detected at earlier stages of infection; however, the conventional bacterial detection procedures are complex and timeconsuming. In contrast, the advanced molecular approaches such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) have significantly reduced the detection time; nevertheless, such approaches are not acceptable to a large extent and are mostly laborious and expensive. Therefore, the development of fast, inexpensive, sensitive, and specific approaches for pathogen detection is essential for different applications in food industry, clinical diagnosis, biological defense and counter-terrorism. To this end, the novel sensing approaches involving bacteriophages as recognition elements are receiving immense consideration owing to their high degree of specificity, accuracy, and reduced assay times. Besides, the phages are easily produced and are tolerant to extreme pH, temperature, and organic solvents as compared to antibodies. To date, several phage-based assays and sensors have been developed involving different systems such as quartz crystal microbalance, magnetoelastic platform, surface plasmon resonance, and electrochemical methods. This review highlights different taxonomic species and genera of phages infecting eight common disease-causing bacterial genera. It further overviews the most recent advancements in phage-based sensing assays and sensors. Likewise, it elaborates various whole-phage and phage components-based assays. Overall, this review emphasizes the importance of electrochemical biosensors as simple, reliable, cost-effective, and accurate tools for bacterial detection.

AB In the present manuscript, a closed bipolar electrode system integrated with electrochemiluminescence (ECL) detection has been introduced for sensitive diagnosis of human breast cancer cells (MCF-7). For sensitive and selective detection, the anodic pole of the bipolar electrode was modified with the AS1411 aptamer, a specific aptamer for the nucleolin, and treated by the secondary aptamer modified gold nanoparticles. The electrochemiluminescence of luminol was followed in the presence of hydrogen peroxide on the anode pole of bipolar electrode (BPE) as an analytical signal. Moreover, 3D printed microchannels were used for the fabrication of BPE systems to minimize the required amounts of sample. The present aptasensor offers low cost, sensitive and selective cancer cell detection with two acceptable linear ranges. The first linear section appears within 10-100 cells and the latter is found to be within 100-700 cells. The limit of detection was about 10 cells.

AB From a fundamental standpoint, microbial electrochemistry is unravelling a thrilling link between life and materials. Technically, it may be the source of a large number of new processes such as microbial fuel cells for powering remote sensors, autonomous sensors, microbial electrolysers and equipment for effluent treatment. Microbial electron transfers are also involved in many natural processes such as biocorrosion. In these contexts, a huge number of studies have dealt with the impact of electrode materials, coatings and surface functionalizations but very few have focused on the effect of the surface topography, although it has often been pointed out as a key parameter impacting the performance of electroactive biofflms.
   The first part of the review gives an overview of the influence of electrode topography on abiotic electrochemical reactions. The second part recalls some basics of the effect of surface topography on bacterial adhesion and biofilm formation, in a broad domain reaching beyond the context of electroactivity. On these well-established bases, the effect of surface topography is reviewed and analysed in the field of electroactive biofilms. General trends are extracted and fundamental questions are pointed out, which should be addressed to boost future research endeavours. The objective is to provide basic guidelines useful to the widest possible range of research communities so that they can exploit surface topography as a powerful lever to improve, or to mitigate in the case of biocorrosion for instance, the performance of electrode/biofilm interfaces.

AB Here, a novel Faraday cage-type electrochemiluminescence (ECL) biosensor was presented for simultaneous determination of miRNA-141 and miRNA-21 based on the potential-resolved strategy. In this work, capture units were prepared by immobilizing hairpin DNA1 (HP1) and hairpin DNA2 (HP2) on Fe3O4 @Au nanocomposites, while g-C3N4 @AuNPs nanocomposites labelled by signal DNA1 (sDNA1) and ruthenium-based metal organic framework (Ru-MOF) nanosheets labelled by signal DNA2 (sDNA2) were used as signal units. In this proposed biosensor, signal units g-C3N4 @AuNPs-sDNA1 and Ru-MOF-sDNA2 could exhibit two strong and stable ECL emissions at - 1.4 V and + 1.5 V respectively, which could be used as effective potential-resolved signal tags. Moreover, taking advantage of the proposed Faraday cage-type model, all electrochemiluminophores in the signal units could take part in electrode reactions, the signal units became part of the electrode surface and extended the outer Helmholtz plane (OHP) of the proposed electrode, and then the detection sensitivity was improved greatly. Accordingly, dual targets miRNA-141 and miRNA-21 could be detected within the linear range of 1 fM to 10 pM, with the detection limit of 0.3 fM. Meanwhile, the proposed miRNA assay exhibited high selectivity and sensitivity, even for practical analysis in human serum. So, this potential-resolved ECL biosensor is proved to be a feasible tool for dual targets detection of miRNAs in clinical diagnosis.

AB Serum total bile acids (TBA) level is used as a sensitive and reliable index for hepatobiliary diseases in clinics. Herein, a novel electrochemical biosensor was fabricated using enzymatic reaction coupling with the double oxidation circular amplification strategy for the detection of human serum TBA. With the catalysis of 3 alpha-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3 alpha-HSD), 3 alpha-bile acids reacted specifically with nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD(+)). And then, the reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) was produced. After that, the NADH reacted with the electron mediator of tris(2,2'-bipyridine) ruthenium(III) (Ru(bpy)(3)(3+)), which was then transformed to Ru(bpy)(3)(2+). Ultimately, Ru(bpy)(3)(2+) was further oxidized to Ru(bpy)(3)(3+) under a certain voltage, which was detected by the chronoamperometry assay. The detection was performed using a disposable unmodified screen-printed carbon electrode (SPCE) without sample preparation. The proposed biosensor showed high sensitivity and accuracy with the linear range from 5.0 to 150.0 pmol/L in 10(6)-fold dilution serum. The established method had a good correlation with the enzymatic cycling method (r = 0.9372, P < 0.001, n = 72) commonly used in clinic. The electrochemical biosensor is simple, ultrasensitive and without sample pretreatment, showing great potential for point-of-care testing (POCT) of serum TBA in clinical samples. In addition, the biosensor is cost-effective with a small volume of samples, especially suitable for those who have difficulties in blood collection, such as infants, children and some small animals.

AB Determining the migratory and invasive capacity of cancer cells as well as clarifying the underlying mechanisms are most relevant for developing biosensors in cancer diagnosis, prognosis, drug development and treatment. Intravasation of metastatic cells into blood stream initiated by their invasion to vascular layer would be a significant characteristic of metastasis. Many types of biochemical and bioelectrical sensors were developed for early detection of metastasis. The simplicity of the setup, the ease of the readout, detection of the trace of rare metastatic cells and the feasibility to perform the assay with standard laboratory equipment are some of the challenges limiting the usability of the sensors in tracing the metastasis. Here we describe a biosensor based on recently reported metastatic diagnosis assay; Metas-Chip, with the assistance of nanoroughened Poly-methyl methacrylate (PMMA) layer to diagnose populated metastatic breast cells from primary cancerous ones. Retraction and detachment of Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells (HUVECs) invaded by metastatic cells as a recently found phenomena is the mechanism of the action. A population of HUVECs would be detached from the gold microelectrodes, patterned on nanoroughened surface, which would lead to large changes in impedance. Here, applying biocompatible and patternable nanoroughened surface instead of using adhesive layers which might produce electrical noises resulted in great sensitivity and detectivity of the sensor. Apart from the tight interaction between endothelial cells and nanocontacts of the electrodes, using low concentration (10%) of tumor cells in this invasion assay, might enhance its application in clinical trials.

AB This paper presents an innovative approach in the portable Point-of-Care diagnostics field, the Plug-and-Power concept. In this new disposable sensor and plug-and-play reader paradigm, the energy required to perform a measurement is always available within the disposable test component. The reader unit contains all the required electronic modules to run the test, process data and display the result, but does not include any battery or power source. Instead, the disposable part acts as both the sensor and the power source. Additionally, this approach provides environmental benefits related to battery usage and disposal, as the paper-based power source has nontoxic redox chemistry that makes it eco-friendly and safe to follow the same waste stream as disposable test strips. The feasibility of this Plug-and-Power approach is demonstrated in this work with the development of a self-powered portable glucometer consisting of two parts: a test strip including a paper-based power source and a paper-based biofuel cell as a glucose sensor; and an application-specific battery-less electronic reader designed to extract the energy from the test strip, process the signal provided and show the glucose concentration on a display. The device was tested with human serum samples with glucose concentrations between 5 and 30 mM, providing quantitative results in good agreement with commercial measuring instruments. The advantages of the present approach can be extended to any kind of biosensors measuring different analytes and biological matrices, and in this way, strengthen the goals of Point-of-Care diagnostics towards laboratory decentralization, personalized medicine and improving patient compliance.

AB The performance characteristics of a new selective and sensitive modified screen printed electrode (MSPE; electrode I) and carbon paste electrode (MCPE; electrode II) based on 2-N, N-dimethylcarbamimidoyl (metformin) as modifier for the potentiometric determination of copper (II) in water sample, serum and urine samples of Wilson disease patients have been optimized. The chemical reaction which happens between Cu (II) and the modifier on the surface of the sensors was investigated with scanning electron microscope (SEM), energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDX), IR spectra measurement and computational calculations at DFT/B3LYP. The sensors showed perfect potentiometric response for Cu (II) over concentration range of 1.0 x 10(-6) - 1.0 x 10(-2) and 1.0 x 10(-6) - 5.0 x 10(-2) mol L-1 with a detection limit of 1.0 x 10(-6) mol L-l with divalent slope value 30.2 and 31.8 mV decade(-1) over the pH range of 2-6 for MCPE and MSPE, respectively. MSPE was stable with repeatable potential over period of 37 days and exhibits fast response time of 6 and 10 s for MSPE and MCPE, respectively. Also, these sensors exhibited good selectivity towards Cu(II) with respect to other metal ions and have higher antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus as Gram-positive bacteria and Escherichia coli as Gram-negative bacteria. The obtained results using the sensors were in agreement with those obtained using the reported method.

AB The rapid and sensitive detection of pathogen DNA (Deoxyribonucleic acid) would be essential for diagnosis and appropriate antibiotic treatment time. Herein, we report a novel direct DNA detectable impedimetric sensor. Direct assay of the amplified target DNA (mecA gene from methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA)) was performed using the PCR (polymerase chain reaction) product without any purification. Even though there are lots of PCR reagents and excess salts in sample PCR product, the nanogap electrode-based impedimetric sensor was able to detect DNA amplification fast in 5th PCR cycle which had 260 fM mecA gene in sample originally. The 70 nm gap electrode sensor yielded over 20% signal increase at the 5th PCR cycle and the impedance change grew up to about 60% at 25th in case of sample with 260 fM mecA gene template originally. The increased concentration of target DNA template led to the rise in impedance change such as 60% up at 5th and 120% up at 25th cycle with 260 pM, respectively. It is very outstanding result as compared with the traditional PCR agarose gel. Besides, it is 7-fold superior sensitivity to the microgap electrode. Furthermore, genomic DNA sample extracted from MRSA was detected rapidly. The nanogap electrode-based impedimetric sensor could be a good candidate for a rapid, sensitive, and low-cost electrical biosensor for DNA characterization in diagnostics and disease monitoring.

AB Circulating leukocytes comprise of approximately 1% of all blood cells and efficient enrichment of these cells from whole blood is critical for understanding cellular heterogeneity and biological significance in health and diseases. In this work, we report a novel microfluidic strategy for rapid (< 1 h) label-free leukocyte sorting and impedance-based profiling to determine cell activation in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) using whole blood. Leukocytes were first size-fractionated into different subtypes (neutrophils, monocytes, lymphocytes) using an inertial spiral sorter prior to single-cell impedance measurement in a microfluidic device with coplanar electrode design. Significant changes in membrane dielectric properties (size and opacity) were detected between healthy and activated leukocytes (TNF-alpha/LPS stimulated), during monocyte differentiation and among different monocyte subsets (classical, intermediate, non-classical). As proof-of-concept for diabetes testing, neutrophil/monocyte dielectric properties in T2DM subjects (n = 8) were quantified which were associated with cardiovascular risk factors including lipid levels, C-reactive protein (CRP) and vascular functions (LnRHI) (P < 0.05) were observed. Overall, these results clearly showed that T2DM subjects have pro-inflammatory leukocyte phenotypes and suggest leukocyte impedance signature as a novel surrogate biomarker for inflammation.

AB In this study, a uniformly mixed sensing layer of typically immiscible compounds, such as tetrathiafulvalene (TTF) mediator and glucose oxidase (GOx) enzyme, was developed using a simultaneous spray deposition technique ideal for mass production of glucose sensors at low cost while exhibiting enhanced amperometric response. For comparison, the sensors were fabricated via three different methods: conventional drop-cast of TTF and GOx compounds in subsequent layers (DL), spray deposition of the compounds in subsequent layers (SL), and spray mixing of the compounds as one uniform layer (SM). Uniformity of the sensing layers was investigated via Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and Energy Dispersive X-Ray Spectroscopy (EDX) techniques demonstrating an even distribution of the TTF and GOx throughout the sensing layer for the SM sensors. The amperometric studies showed a significantly larger maximum current response, I-max and sensitivity for the SM sensors as compared to the SL and DL sensors. The significantly better performance of the SM sensors correlated well with the even distribution of TTF and GOx throughout the sensing layer, resulting in enhanced electron transfer and redox reaction between GOx and TTF. The SM spray technique was then applied to deposit a uniformly mixed sensing layer on to 3D microneedle arrays to provide minimally invasive continuous glucose monitoring (CGM). In-vivo studies showed amperometric response from the microneedle CGM device was compatible to changes in blood glucose levels measured via the standard finger prick tests. Importantly, the deposition technique is suitable for mass production of the microneedle CGM at very low cost.

AB Siderophores are small organic compounds secreted by microorganisms under iron-depleted conditions which enhance the uptake of iron. Siderophores can play vital roles in ecology, agriculture, bioremediation, biosensor, and medicine. In recent years, the concept of siderophore-based biosensing devices has opened new horizons in high precision detection of various metal ions especially the iron, microorganisms, phosphopeptides, antibiotics as well pesticides. Once combined with nanomaterials, nano-scale siderophore systems provide powerful analytical platforms for detection of low concentration of metal ions and numerous pathogens. In this article, a brief overview of general aspects of siderophore is firstly discussed. In addition, a clear and concise review of recent advances of siderophore-based biosensors (siderosensor) and nanosensors are mainly discussed herein. Subsequently, future perspectives and challenges of siderophore-based sensors are discussed briefly.

AB Localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) induced charge separation were concentrated on the metal nano particles surface, which made it sensitive to the surface refractive index changes during optical sensing. Similarly, electrochemical detection was based on the electron transformation on the electrode surface. Herein, we fabricated a nanochip by decorating a nanocone-array substrate with gold nanoparticles and silver nano particles for dynamic electro-optical spectroscopy. Mercaptophenyl boronic acid (MPBA) was immobilized firmly on the nanochip by the metal-S bond for sensitive sialic acid sensing. Owing to the high stability of gold nanoparticles and the high sensitivity of silver nanoparticles, the nanochip showed good performance in LSPR detection with rich and high responses. Besides, the nanochip also showed sensitive electrical signals during electrochemical detection due to the excitation of the energetic charges from the nanoparticles surface to the reaction system. The dynamic electro-optical spectroscopy was based on a unique combination of LSPR and linear sweep voltammetry (LSV). On the one hand, electrochemical signals activated the electrons on the nanochip to promote the propagation and resonance of surface plasmon. On the other hand, LSPR concentrated the electrons on the nanochip surface, which made the electrons easily driven to enhance the current in electrochemical detection. Results showed that mutual promotion of electrochemical-LSPR on nanochip covered a linear dynamic range from 0.05 mM to 5 mM on selective sialic acid detection with a low detection limit of 17 mu M. The synchronous amplification of the electro-optical response during electrochemical-LSPR, opened up a new perspective for efficient and sensitive biochemical detection.

AB An organic aptamer functionalized electrochemical transistor has been developed to detect the presence of epinephrine molecule which acts as an excitatory neurotransmitter. The abnormalities in the level of epinephrine are the direct symptoms of some diseases such as Takotsubo cardiomyopathy, myocardial infarction, arrhythmias and other heart related diseases. The present approach is based on immobilization of aptamers on the gate electrode which selectively binds to epinephrine with high affinity. The introduction of epinephrine in the system causes screening of negative charge of aptamers as well as the production of Faradaic current due to oxidation of epinephrine. The synergistic effect of these two events decreases the overall channel current which was seen in both transfer characteristics and current-time curve. Additional experiments against common interfering agents (dopamine, ascorbic acid, DOPAC etc) showed no decrease in the current which indicates high specificity of the sensor. Overall, the incorporation of aptamers in the transistor has allowed us to obtain a sensor exhibiting the lowest limit of detection for epinephrine (90 pM) till date which is comparable to normal physiological level. This approach provides a real-time detection of a large range of biomolecules and viral proteins in a time and cost-effective manner and has applications in point-of-care testing tool for several diagnostic applications.

AB In this work, a novel and facile electrochemical sensor is reported for the highly selective and sensitive detection of dissolved hydrogen sulfide (H2S), attributing to the redox reaction between Au@Ag core-shell nanoparticles (Au@Ag NPs) and H2S. Electroactive Au@Ag NPs not only possess excellent conductivity, but exhibit great electrochemical reactivity at 0.26 V due to the electrochemical oxidation from Ag degrees to Ag+. In the presence of H2S, the Ag shell of Au@Ag NPs can be oxidized to Ag2S, resulting in the decrease of differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) peak at 0.26 V. The electrochemical sensor exhibits a wide linear response range from 0.1 nM to 500 nM. The limit of detection (LOD) for H2S is as low as 0.04 nM. The developed sensor shows significant prospects in the study of pathological processes related to the mechanism of H2S production.

AB A simple-prepare, single-use and cost-effective, in vitro biosensor for the detection of TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43), a biomarker of neuro-degenerative disorders, was designed, manufactured and tested. This study reports the first biosensor application for the detection of TDP-43 using a novel biosensor fabrication methodology. Bioconjugation mechanism was applied by conjugating anti-TDP 43 with N-succinimidyl S-acetylthioacetate (SATA) producing a thiol-linked anti-TDP 43, which was used to directly link with gold electrode surface, minimizing the preparation steps for biosensor fabrication and simplifying the biosensor surface. The effectiveness of this bioconjugation mechanism was evaluated and confirmed by FqRRM12 protein, using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). The surface coverage of the electrode was analyzed by Time-of-Flight Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry (TOF-SIMS). Differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) was acted as the detection transduction mechanism with the use of [Fe(CN)(6)](3-/4-) redox probe. Human TDP-43 peptide of 0.0005 mu g/mL to 2 mu g/mL in undiluted human serum was analyzed using this TDP-43 biosensor. Interference study of the TDP-43 biosensor using beta-amyloid 42 protein and T-tau protein confirmed the specificity of this TDP-43 biosensor. This bioconjugation chemistry based approach for biosensor fabrication circumvents tedious gold surface modification and functionalization while enabling specific detection of TDP-43 in less than 1 h with a low fabrication cost of a single biosensor less than $3.

AB Vertically aligned carbon nanotube array (VANTA) coatings have recently garnered significant attention due in part to their unique material properties including light absorption, chemical inertness, and electrical conductivity. Herein we report the first use of VANTAs grown via chemical vapor deposition in a 2D interdigitated electrode (IDE) footprint with a high height-to-width aspect ratio (3:1 or 75:25 mu m). The VANTA-IDEs were functionalized with an antibody (Ab) specific to the human cancerous inhibitor PP2A (CIP2A)-an oncoprotein that is associated with a variety of malignancies such as oral, breast, and multiple myeloma cancers. The resultant label-free immunosensor was capable of detecting CIP2A across a wide linear sensing range (1 - 100 pg/mL) with a detection limit of 0.24 pg/mL within saliva supernatant-a range that is more sensitive than the corresponding CIP2A enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). These results help pave the way for rapid cancer screening tests at the point-of-care (POC) such as for the early-stage diagnosis of oral cancer at a dentist's office.

AB Current techniques for the detection of multi-pesticides are limited by technical complexity, sensitivity and cost. There is an urgent demand of developing new specific recognition elements and sensitive signal readouts for on site monitoring. In this work, we developed a fluorescent aptamer-based lateral flow biosensor (apta-LFB) integrated with fluorophore-quencher nano-pairs and a smartphone spectrum reader to accomplish triple-target detection of chlorpyrifos, diazinon, and malathion. Aptamers serve as alternative recognition elements instead of antibodies in LFB, offering better specificity and stability. A novel fluorophore-quencher nano-pair (quantum dots nanobeads and gold nanostars) was implemented to perform "signal-on" instead of "signal-off". After optimization, detection limit of chlorpyrifos, diazinon, and malathion were determined to be 0.73 ng/mL, 6.7 ng/mL, and 0.74 ng/mL, respectively. Greatly increased sensitivity may come from the combination of improved signal and zero background. This innovative cascade strategy allowed to lower the detection limit of pesticides residue level in food, which is largely considered satisfactory. The accuracy and practicality of this design for effective on-site quantification of multi-pesticides were further confirmed using 12 vegetable and fruit samples. The estimated recoveries were between 82.4% and 112.8% in spiked vegetable samples, which indicated that the developed method is capable for detecting multi-pesticides in food samples. This sensitive handheld-system is promising to become a powerful tool for practical on-site application of multi-pesticide quantification procedures.

AB A novel cascade photoelectrochemical (PEC) signal amplification biosensing tactics was developed for DNA detection based on a target-driven DNA association to induce cyclic hairpin assembly. In the circulatory system there are two ssDNA (A and B) and two hairpins (C and D). The hybridization of these ssDNA led to the formation of an A target B structure. The close proximity of their toehold and branch-migration regions was able to induce the cyclic hairpin assembly. Afterwards, the assembly result further causes the separation of a double-stranded probe DNA (Q:F) to switch the PEC signal via toehold-mediated strand replacement. As such, the signal stranded DNA-CdS QDs (F) as the signal tag was released in the presence of the target DNA. The signal DNA-CdS QDs was then coated to F-doped tin oxide (FTO) electrode leading to the "signal-on" PEC signal. The designed biosensing strategy showed a low detection limit of 21.3 pM for target DNA and a broad linear range from 50 pM to 100 nM. This signal amplification PEC sensing method exhibited a potential application to detect protein molecules, RNA or metal ions via changing the sequence of A and B recognition.

AB Nanocomposite materials have provided a wide range of conductivity, sensitivity, selectivity and linear response for electrochemical biosensors. However, the detection of rare cells at single cell level requires a new class of nanocomposite-coated electrodes with exceptional sensitivity and specificity. We recently developed a construct of gold nanoparticle-grafted functionalized graphene and nanostructured polyaniline (PANI) for high-performance biosensing within a very wide linear response and selective performance. Further, replacing the expensive gold nanoparticles with low-cost silver nanoparticles as well as optimizing the nanocomposite synthesis and ftmctionalization protocols on the electrode surface in this work enabled us to develop ultrasensitive nano-composites for label-free detection of breast cancer cells. The sensor presented a fast response time of 30 min within a dynamic range of 10 - 5 x 10(6) cells mL(-1) and with a detection limit of 2 cells mL(-1) for the detection of SK-BR3 breast cancer cell. The nano-biosensor, for the first time, demonstrated a high efficiency of > 90% for the label-free detection of cancer cells in whole blood sample without any need for sample preparation and cell staining. The results demonstrated that the optimized nanocomposite developed in this work is a promising nanomaterial for electrochemical biosensing and with the potential applications in electro-catalysis and super capacitances.

AB The rapid diagnosis of pathogens is crucial in the early stages of treatment of diseases where the choice of the correct drug can be critical. Although conventional cell culture-based techniques have been widely utilized in clinical applications, newly introduced optical-based, microfluidic chips are becoming attractive. The advantages of the novel methods compared to the conventional techniques comprise more rapid diagnosis, lower consumption of patient sample and valuable reagents, easy application, and high reproducibility in the detection of pathogens. The miniaturized channels used in microfluidic systems simulate interactions between cells and reagents in microchannel structures, and evaluate the interactions between biological moieties to enable diagnosis of microorganisms. The overarching goal of this review is to provide a summary of the development of microfluidic biochips and to comprehensively discuss different applications of microfluidic biochips in the detection of pathogens. New types of microfluidic systems and novel techniques for viral pathogen detection (e.g. HIV, HVB, ZIKV) are covered. Next generation techniques relying on high sensitivity, specificity, lower consumption of precious reagents, suggest that rapid generation of results can be achieved via optical based detection of bacterial cells. The introduction of smartphones to replace microscope based observation has substantially improved cell detection, and allows facile data processing and transfer for presentation purposes.

AB Pico sized Stannous oxide particles (SnO PPs) were synthesized in an ethanol-water solvent system on the surface of nitrogen doped graphene oxide (GO). The highly conductive support was a combination of dual interactions between 4-aminomethylbenzylamine (AMBA) and GO. The oppositely positioned -NH2 linkers of the AMBA were covalently incorporated into the GO matrix through condensation reaction followed by the strong pi-pi stacking interactions between aromatic rings of AMBA and GO. The change in the local chemical environment of GO via dual interactions provided a suitable atmosphere for the growth and dispersion of SnO PPs on GO-AMBA surface. The possible mechanism for the formation of SnO in an ethanol-water solvent system was evaluated. Furthermore, a light was shed on the factors responsible for the pico size of SnO particles synthesis along with its phenomenal distribution on the GO-AMBA surface. The catalyst containing SnO PPs was deployed as a biosensor for the detection of ascorbic acid (AA) for the very first time. A very wide linear range of 5.0 x 10(-5)-7.0 x 10(-3) M, limit of detection (LOD) of 1.19 x 10(-5) M along with excellent practical feasibility, storage stability, repeatability and selectivity towards AA electrooxidation showed the excellent synergy between nitrogen-rich GO surface and SnO PPs. The sensitivity (885.54 mu AmM(-1)cm(-2)) of the catalyst was the most attractive feature, as it was obtained in the presence of 5 and 2-fold higher concentration of UA and DA interfering species respectively.

AB It is a novel competitive challenge for electrochemical biosensor to directly, rapidly and ultrasensitively detect the disease markers in the whole serum due to biofouling caused by the complexity of actual samples. In this paper, poly (ethylene glycol) (PEG) and hyaluronic acid (HA) were utilized to modify Fe3O4 @Au nanoparticles (NPs). Based on the successfully preparation and characterization of Fe3O4 @Au@PEG@HA NPs with TEM, SEM, XRD, FTIR and EDS, respectively, a novel immunosensor of brucellosis with high selectivity, sensitivity and almost perfect protein-resistant properties in various external environments, especially, in complex biological systems was fabricated. More importantly, this immunosensor is capable of assaying brucellosis antibody in 100% serum without suffering from any significant biological interference. In addition, a wide linear response range from 10(-15) g mL(-1) to 10(-11) g mL(-1) towards antibody in 100% serum and a low limit of detection (LOD) of 0.36 fg mL(-1) (3 sigma, n = 13) are demonstrated, which indicates that this immunosensor has a promising potential in clinical diagnosis.

AB In this work, quaternary CdZnTeS quantum dots (QDs) with a particularly strong electrochemiluminescence (ECL) were synthesized as ECL signal labels. The strong ECL signals can be obtained at both cathode and anode with the ECL efficiencies of 19.78% and 1.62%, respectively. The sandwich-structured ECL immunosensors for the detection of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) and cancer antigen 125 (CA125) were accomplished with direct ECL image analysis. Under optimal conditions, the QDs-based ECL image immunoanalysis possessed good linearity from 0.5 ng/mL to 20 ng/mL for AFP and from 20 U/mL to 500 U/mL for CA125 with the detection limit of 0.1 ng/mL and 6 U/mL, respectively (S/N = 3), and the lower detection limit obtained by photomultiplier tube were 0.1 fg/mL for AFP and 0.03 mU/mL for CA125 with the wide dynamic range from 0.5 fg/mL to 20 ng/mL and from 0.1 mU/mL to 500 U/mL, respectively (S/N = 3). Furthermore, the ECL immunoanalysis was evaluated with commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in human serum samples. The good results indicated that CdZnTeS QDs-based ECL biosensor has great potential for fast biomedical screening and multi assays in clinical diagnosis.

AB An effective method of combating infectious diseases is the deployment of hand-held devices at the point-of-care (POC) for screening or self-monitoring applications. There is a need for very sensitive, low-cost and quantitative diagnostic devices. In this study, we present a low-cost, multiplexed fluorescence detection platform that has a high sensitivity and wide dynamic range. Our system features inexpensive 3 x 3 mm interference filters with a high stopband rejection, sharp transition edges, and greater than 90% transmission in the passband. In addition to the filters, we improve signal-to-noise ratio by leveraging time for accuracy using a charge-integration-based readout. The fluorescence sensing platform provides a sensitivity to photon flux of similar to 1 x 10(4) photons/mm(2) sec and has the potential for 2-3 orders of magnitude improvement in sensitivity over standard colorimetric detection that uses colored latex microspheres. We also detail the design, development, and characterization of our low-cost fluorescence detection platform and demonstrate 100% and 97.96% reduction in crosstalk probability and filter cost, respectively. This is achieved by reducing filter dimensions and ensuring appropriate channel isolation in a 2 x 2 array configuration. Practical considerations with low-cost interference filter system design, analysis, and system performance are also discussed. The performance of our platform is compared to that of a standard laboratory array scanner. We also demonstrate the detection of antibodies to human papillomavirus (HPV16) E7 protein, as a potential biomarker for early cervical cancer detection in human plasma.

AB The emission intensity of GaInAsP semiconductors that show an ion sensitivity is altered by the surface charge. In this study, we propose a biosensing technique using GaInAsP photonic crystal nanolasers based on this principle. Here, simple and rapid detection of collapsin response mediator protein 2 (CRMP2) is demonstrated, which is a promising biomarker candidate for neuropsychiatric diseases existing in peripheral white blood cells. We prepared CRMP2 as a standard protein and introduced sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) as an anionic surfactant to enhance the net negative charge of the protein. The nanolaser was modified in advance with an anti-CRMP2 antibody and then photopumped at a constant power. The laser emission intensity was monitored during the antibody antigen reaction. Consequently, CRMP2 was detected as a decrease in the emission intensity. We achieved a lower limit for detection of 3.8 mu g/mL that satisfies the requirement for clinical biomarker testing. Without the requirements of any kind of labels and spectral analyses, this technique allows for simple, rapid, and low-cost biomarker detection.

AB The loading capacity of thionin (Thi) on shortened multi-walled carbon nanotubes (S-MWCNTs) and acidified multi-walled carbon nanotubes (A-MWCNTs) was compared. Two DNA probe fragments were designed for hybridization with microRNA-21 (miR-21), the microRNAs (miRNAs) model analyte. DNA probe 1 (P1) was assembled on Au nanoparticles (AuNPs) modified electrode. MiR-21 was captured by the pre-immobilized P1. A signal nanoprobe was synthesized by loading large amount of Thi on S-MWCNTs with covalently bonded probe 2 (P2). Owing to the large effective surface area of MWCNTs, fast electron shuttle of MWCNTs, high-loaded Thi on S-MWCNTs, and the increased conductivity from AuNPs, after signal probe hybridized with miR-21, it gave rise to a magnified current response on electrode. The increased electrochemical current enabled us to quantitatively detect miR-21. Expensive bioreagents and labeled target/detection DNA or miRNAs were avoided in this strategy. The operation complexity and assay cost were also reduced.

AB Interferon-gamma is a proinflammatory cytokine, and its production is related with effective host defense against intracellular pathogens. Therefore, the level of interferon-gamma is considered a good biomarker for intracellular infections. It is also useful for the assessment, treatment progression and follow-up of non-communicable diseases, including cancer and autoimmune disorders, among others. This work addresses the development of a novel interferon-gamma release assay (IGRA) to evaluate the expression of interferon-gamma transcripts as biomarker produced by isolated T cells, as a main advantage. The method sequentially combined three different types of magnetic separation, including the immunomagnetic separation of the T cells performed on antiCD3 modified magnetic particles, the retrotranscription and multiplex double-tagging PCR on polydT-modified magnetic particles and, finally, the electrochemical genosensing on streptavidin magnetic particles as a support. This approach is able to quantify the levels of cellular interferon-gamma produced by as low as 150 T cells with outstanding analytical features. The detection of interferon-gamma transcripts is performed from only 100 mu L of whole blood which can be potentially obtained by fingerpricic, demonstrating a further clear advantage to be considered as a promising strategy for the quantification of this important biomarker in several clinical applications.

AB Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) donor-specific antibodies are key serum biomarkers for assessing the outcome of transplanted patients. Measuring their active concentration, ie. the fraction that really interacts with donor HLA, and their affinity could help deciphering their pathogenicity. Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) is recognized as the gold-standard for measuring binding kinetics but also active concentrations, without calibration curves. SPR-based biosensors often suffer from non-specific binding (NSB) occurring with the sensor chip surface and the immobilized targets, especially for complex media such as human serum. In this work we show that several serum treatments such as dialysis or IgG purification reduce NSB but insufficiently for SPR applications. We then demonstrate that the NSB contribution to the SPR signal can be eliminated to determine precisely and reliably the active concentration and the affinity of anti-HLA antibodies from patients' sera. This was achieved even at concentrations close to the limit of quantification of the method, in the 0.5-1 nM range. The robustness of the assay was demonstrated by using a wide range of artificially generated NSB and by varying the density of the targets captured onto the surface. The assay is of general interest and can be used with molecules generating strong NSB, as far as a non-cognate target structurally close to the target can be captured on the same flow cell, in a different binding cycle. Compared with current fluorescence-based methods that are semi-quantitative, we expect this SPR-based assay to help better understanding anti-HLA antibodies pathogenicity and improving organ recipients' management.

AB Polyoxymetalates (POMs) ([SiW11O39{Sn(CH2)(2)CO)}(4-) and [P2W17O61{Sn(CF12)(2)CO)}(6-)) were used to modify dideoxynucleotides (ddNTPs) through amide bond formation, and applied to the multiplexed detection of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in an electrochemical primer extension reaction. Each gold electrode of an array was functionalised with a short single stranded thiolated DNA probe, specifically designed to extend with the POM-ddNTP at the SNP site to be interrogated. The system was applied to the simultaneous detection of 4 SNPs within a single stranded 103-mer model target generated using asymmetric PCR, highlighting the potential of POM-ddNTPs for targeted, multiplexed SNP detection. The four DNA bases were successfully labelled with both ([SiW11O39{Sn(CH2)(2)CO)}(4-) and [P2W17O61{Sn(CF12)(2)CO)}(6-)), and [SiW11O39{Sn(CF12)(2)CO)}(6-) demonstrated to be the more suitable due to its single oxidation peak, which provides an unequivocal signal. The POMddNTP enzymatically incorporated to the DNA anchored to the surface was visualised by AFM using gold coated mica. The developed assay has been demonstrated to be highly reproducible, simple to carry out and with very low non-specific background signals. Future work will focus on applying the developed platform to the detection of SNPs associated with rifampicin resistance in real samples from patients suffering from tuberculosis.

AB To date, DNA cleavage, caused by cleavage agents, has been monitored mainly by gel and capillary electrophoresis. However, these techniques are time-consuming, non-quantitative and require gel stains. In this work, a novel, simple and, importantly, a quantitative method for monitoring the DNA nuclease activity of potential anticancer drugs, at a DNA electrochemical sensor, is presented. The DNA sensors were prepared using thiol-modified oligonucleotides that self-assembled to create a DNA monolayer at gold electrode surfaces. The quantification of DNA double-strand breaks is based on calculating the DNA surface coverage, before and after exposure to a DNA cleavage agent. The nuclease properties of a model DNA cleavage agent, copper bis-phenanthroline ([Cu-II(phen)(2)](2+)), that can cleave DNA in a Fenton-type reaction, were quantified electrochemically. The DNA surface coverage decreased on average by 21% after subjecting the DNA sensor to a nuclease assay containing [Cu-II(phen)(2)](2+), a reductant and an oxidant. This percentage indicates that 6 base pairs were cleaved in the nuclease assay from the immobilised 30 base pair strands. The DNA cleavage can be also induced electrochemically in the absence of a chemical reductant. [Cu-II(phen)(2)](2+) intercalates between DNA base pairs and, on application of a suitable potential, can be reduced to [Cu-I(phen)(2)](+), with dissolved oxygen acting as the required oxidant. This reduction process is facilitated through DNA strands via long-range electron transfer, resulting in DNA cleavage of 23%. The control measurements for both chemically and electrochemically induced cleavage revealed that DNA strand breaks did not occur under experimental conditions in the absence of [Ct(II)(Phen)(2)](2+).

AB In this work, a CuS-TiO2 heterojunction composite was prepared by dispersedly depositing CuS nanoparticles on TiO2 nanospheres surface with a hydrothermal method, and was then used to construct a photoelectrochemical (PEC) aptasensor for sensitive detection of microcystin-LR (MC-LR) in aquatic environment. The energy bands of CuS nanoparticles and spherical anatase TiO2 were well matched, which enhanced the photo-to-current conversion efficiency. The composite exhibited the enhanced visible light absorption, the improved separation of photo-generated charges, and the reduced self-aggregation of CuS nanoparticles, leading to the enhanced photocurrent response. The PEC aptasensor was constructed by immobilizing CuS-TiO2 composite on ITO electrode with chitosan film that further covalently bound aminated aptamer. After the target, microcystin-LR (MC-LR) as an analyte model, was captured by the aptamer on the aptasensor, it could be oxidized by the photo generated hole to impede the electron-hole recombination and further amplify the photocurrent. The PEC aptasensor showed superior analytical performance for MC-LR with a linear range of 5.0 x 10(-5) nM to 250 nM and a detection limit of 2.0 x 10(-5) nM. The detection results with the aptasensor for practical water samples indicated its promising application in environmental monitoring.

AB Simple, selective and sensitive analytical devices are of a great importance for medical application. Herein, we developed highly selective immunosensor for electrochemical detection of C-reactive protein (CRP) in blood sample. Branched polyethylenimine functionalized with ferrocene residues (PEI-Fc) was the main element of the recognition layer, which allowed: (i) covalent binding of an antibody in its most favorable orientation and (ii) voltammetric detection of the C-reactive protein. Anchoring of PEI-Fc to the electrode surface through the electrodeposition process leads to the formation of thin, stable and reproducible layers, which is extremely important in the case of electrochemical immunosensing. The proposed analytical device is characterized by high selectivity and sensitivity and can be successfully used in the concentration range of CRP from 1 to 5.10(4) ng mL(-1). The determined limit of detection was circa 0.5 and 2.5 ng(-1) for voltammetric and impedance analysis, respectively. The developed analytical device has also been successfully applied for the analysis of CRP level in rat blood samples.

AB In this work, a novel surface plasmon resonance (SPR) enhanced electrochemiluminescence (ECL) biosensing model was first designed based on Au NPs@polydopamine (PDA)@CuInZnS QDs nanocomposite. Au NPs were coated with the PDA layer via the electrostatic force. CuInZnS QDs were bound on the surface of Au NPs@PDA nanocomposite. CuInZnS QDs worked as ECL luminophore in the sensing application. PDA shell not only controlled the separation length between Au NPs and QDs to induce SPR enhanced ECL response, but also limited the potential charge transfer and ECL quenching effect. As a result, the nanocomposite ECL intensity was twice that of QDs with K2S2O8. The tumor suppressor p53 gene was detected in the amplified ECL sensing system. The sensing method has a linear response in the range of 0.1 nmol/L to 15 nmol/L with a detection limit of 0.03 nmol/L. The DNA biosensor based on the nanocomposite showed excellent sensitivity, selectivity, reproducibility and stability and was applied in spiked human serum samples with satisfactory results.

AB A capacitive aptasensor for detecting the malaria biomarker, Plasmodium falciparum glutamate dehydrogenase (PfGDH), directly in human serum samples developed. A thiolated ssDNA aptamer (NG3) that binds specifically to PfGDH antigen with high affinity (K-d = 79 nM) was used to develop the aptasensor. The aptasensor produced capacitance response at an optimized frequency of 2 Hz in a non-Faradaic electrochemical impedance based signal transduction platform. The aptasensor exhibited a wide dynamic range of 100 fM - 100 nM with a limits of detection of 0.77 pM in serum samples. The interference from other predominant malarial biomarkers, namely, Plasmodium falciparum -lactate dehydrogenase and -histidine rich protein-II on the aptasensor was negligible. This PfGDH aptasensor with highly sensitive and label free detection capability has great application potential for diagnosis of asymptotic malaria and monitoring the regression of malaria during treatment regime with antimalarial drugs.

AB On-line and real-time analysis of micro-organ activity permits to use the endogenous analytical power of cellular signal transduction algorithms as biosensors. We have developed here such a sensor using only a few pancreatic endocrine islets and the avoidance of transgenes or chemical probes reduces bias and procures general usage. Nutrient and hormone-induced changes in islet ion fluxes through channels provide the first integrative read-out of micro-organ activity. Using extracellular electrodes we captured this read-out non-invasively as slow potentials which reflect glucose concentration-dependent (3-15 mM) micro-organ activation and coupling. Custom-made PDMS-based microfluidics with platinum black micro-electrode arrays required only some tens of islets and functioned at flow rates of 1-10 mu l/min which are compatible with microdialysis. We developed hardware solutions for on-line real-time analysis on a reconfigurable Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) that offered resource-efficient architecture and storage of intermediary processing stages. Moreover, real-time adaptive and reconfigurable algorithms accounted for signal disparities and noise distribution. Based on islet slow potentials, this integrated set-up allowed within less than 40 ps the discrimination and precise automatic ranking of small increases (2 mM steps) of glucose concentrations in real time and within the physiological glucose range. This approach shall permit further development in continuous monitoring of the demand for insulin in type 1 diabetes as well as monitoring of organs-on-chip or maturation of stem-cell derived islets.

AB The accurate therapeutic evaluation for chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) drug is of great importance to minimize side effects and enhance efficacy. Herein, a facile and precise surface-enhanced scattering (SERS) approach based on coupled plasmonic field has been introduced to evaluate the therapeutic outcomes of antileukemia drug through ultrasensitive assay of caspase-3 activity in apoptotic cells. Caspase-3 as an apoptosis indicator could specifically cleave the N-terminus of biotinylated DEVD-peptide (biotin-Gly-Asp-Gly-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-Gly-Cys) immobilized on the Au nanoparticle-decorated TiO2 nanotube arrays (TiO2/Au NTAs) substrate. After the enzyme cleavage with caspase-3, Raman-labelled Au nanostar (AuNS) probes captured the residual DEVD-peptides via the recognition between streptavidin and biotin, thus resulting in an enhanced Raman response on the SERS platform. The variation of Raman intensity revealed caspase-3 activity that reflected the chemotherapeutic effect. On this platform, AuNS nanoprobes offered a large number of binding sites and intrinsic "hot spots" for Raman reporters, while TiO2/Au NTAs rendered a homogenously coupled electromagnetic field between the adjacent repeated units over the large area. In particular, a spatially expanding plasmonic field formed by coupling AuNSs with TiO2/Au NTAs would further heighten Raman enhancement. Taking these advantages, the strong and uniform Raman signals were achieved. Furthermore, the practicability investigation witnessed that the proposed SERS strategy was available to evaluate the therapeutic effect of dasatinib on CML K562 cells. The developed method possesses fascinating advantages of cost-effectiveness, excellent reproducibility and high sensitivity, which endows it with promising potential in apoptosis monitoring and anticancer drug development.

AB Electroplating of nanoporous Pt (nPt) induces an extremely strong tensile stress, which results in the exfoliation of nPt on flexible polymer substrate despite plasma treatment to improve adhesion. Here, we overcame this challenge by modifying flexible stainless-steel, and developed wearable, robust, flexible, and non-enzymatic continuous glucose monitoring system. The flexible stainless-steel was highly effective in improving the adhesion between the metal layer and substrate. The developed wireless system included electrochemical analysis circuits, a microcontroller unit, and a wireless communication module. Finally, we evaluated the continuous glucose monitoring system through two animal testing, by implanting into subcutaneous tissue and measuring interstitial fluid (ISF) glucose values at 5-15-min intervals. Comparison of the measured ISF glucose with blood glucose determined by the Clarke error grid analysis showed that 82.76% of the measured glucose was within zone A. Furthermore, the wearable glucose sensor exhibited bio-compatible to implant through various bio-compatibility tests.

AB We report on direct label-free protein detection in high ionic strength solution and human plasma by a dual-gate nanoribbon-based ion-sensitive field-effect transistor (NR-ISFET) biosensor system with excellent sensitivity and specificity in both solution-gate (SG) and dual-gate (DG) modes. Compared with previously reported results, the NR-ISFET biosensor enables selective prostate specific antigen (PSA) detection based on antibody-antigen binding in broader detection range with lower LOD. For the first time, real-time specific detection of PSA of 10 pM to 1 mu M in 100 mM phosphate buffer (PB) was demonstrated by conductance measurements using the polyethylene glycol (PEG)-modified NR-ISFET biosensors in DG mode with the back-gate bias (V-BG) of 20 V. Due to larger maximum transconductance value resulting from the modulation of NR-ISFET channel by the back gate in DG mode, the detection range can be broadened with larger linear detection region (100 pM to 100 nM) and lower limit of detection (LOD, 10 pM) as compared to those in SG mode. Moreover, the influence of different back-gate bias from V-BG = 5 V to V-BG = 25 V on the biosensor performance has been investigated. Furthermore, direct PSA detection of 100 pM to 1 mu M in human plasma was demonstrated by using the PEG-modified NR-ISFET in DG mode, enabling direct detection of protein in human blood for clinical applications since the LOD of 100 pM PSA can meet the clinical requirements.

AB Technological advances in engineering and cell biology stimulate novel approaches for medical treatment, in particular cell-based therapy. The first cell-based gene therapy against cancer was recently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration. Progress in cancer diagnosis includes a blood test detecting five cancer types. Numerous stem cell phase I/II clinical trials showing safety and efficacy will soon pursue qualifying criteria for advanced therapy medicinal products (ATMP), aspiring to join the first stem-cell therapy approved by the European Medicines Agency. Cell based therapy requires extensive preclinical characterisation of biomarkers indicating mechanisms of action crucial to the desired therapeutic effect. Quantitative analyses monitoring critical functions for the manufacture of optimal cell and tissue-based clinical products include successful potency assays for implementation. The challenge to achieve high quality measurement is increasingly met by progress in biosensor design. We adopt a cell therapy perspective to highlight recent examples of graphene-enhanced biointerfaces for measurement of biomarkers relevant to cancer treatment, diagnosis and tissue regeneration. Graphene based biosensor design problems can thwart their use for health care transformative point of care testing and real-time applications. We discuss concerns to be addressed and emerging solutions for establishing clinical grade biosensors to accelerate human cell therapy.

AB Enlightened by the emerging cell-ion detection based on ion-selective-electrode (ISE), an aptamer capturing and ISE transducing (AC&IT) strategy is proposed on the porous graphene oxide (PGO) decorated ISE (PGO-ISE), its performances in both cell and ion detections are examined by use of AS1411 targeted A549 cell detection and iodide-ISE as proof-of-concept. Firstly, GO flakes, exfoliated from graphite by modified Hummers method, are cross-linked by thiourea mediated hydrothermal process, to 3-dimension networked PGO which is identified by scanning-electron-microscope, UV-visible absorbance and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy; its enhancing effect for cell capturing is evaluated by microscopy. Then, PGO-ISE is constructed by drop-coating PGO film on the surface of ISE and followed by covalently anchoring AS1411. Electrochemistry measurements for different state ISE (blank, PGO coated, AS1411 anchored and A549 captured) are performed by our home-made ISE-measuring system. It is demonstrated that the best cell-sensitivity in buffer is - 25.21 mV/log(10)C(A549) (R-2 = 0.91), resolution in blood is 10 cells/ml. Interestingly, due to PGO's scaffold protection to the ionophore, I-sensitivity is preserved as - 42.98 mV/pI (R-2 = 0.95, pI = -log(10)(C-I)). Theoretical explanations are provided for the double-sensing phenomenon according to basic ISE principle. It is believed the PGO-ISE based aptamer cell sensor will be a promising experimental means for biomedical researches.

AB We presented a novel dual-DNAzyme feedback amplification (DDFA) strategy for Pb2+ detection based on a micropipette tip-based miniaturized homogeneous electrochemical device. The DDFA system involves two rolling circle amplification (RCA) processes in which two circular DNA templates (C1 and C2) have been designed with a Pb2+-DNAzyme sequence (8-17 DNAzyme, anti-GR-5 DNAzyme) and an antisense sequence of G-quadruplex. And a linear DNA (L-DNA), which consists of a primer sequence and a Pb2+-DNAzyme substrate sequence, could hybridize with C1 and C2 to form two DNA complexes. In presence of Pb2+, the Pb2+-DNAzyme exhibited excellent cleavage specificity toward the substrate sequence in L-DNA, leaving primer sequence to trigger two paths of RCA process and finally resulting in massive long nanosolo DNA strands with reduplicated G-quadruplex sequences. And then, methylene blue (MB) could selectively intercalate into G-quadruplex to reduce the free MB concentration in the solution. Thereafter, a carbon fiber microelectrode-based miniaturized electrochemical device was constructed to record the decrease of electrochemical signal due to the much lower diffusion rate of MB/G-quadruplex complex than that of free MB. Therefore, the concentration of Pb2+ could be correctively and sensitively determined in a homogeneous solution by combining DDFA with miniaturized electrochemical device. This protocol not only exhibited high selectivity and sensitivity toward Pb2+ with a detection limit of 0.048 pM, but also reduced sample volume to 10 mu L. In addition, this sensing system has been successfully applied to Pb2+ detection in Yangtze River with desirable quantitative manners, which matched well with the atomic absorption spectrometry (AAS).

AB Development of simple, sensitive and specific method for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) assays are urgently demand. In this study, we developed a novel molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP) electrochemiluminescence (MIP-ECL) sensor for the highly sensitive and selective HIV-1 gene detection using Europium sulfide nanocrystals (EsNCs) as signal producing compound. Here, the HIV aptamer as the template and o-phenylenediamine as the functional monomer, were electropolymerized directly on the surface of ITO electrode. With the hybridization reaction between the assemblies of EuS NCs functionalized 5-amino-labeled oligonucleotides as capture probes and oligonucleotides as detection target (HIV gene), the ECL signal significantly increased using K2S2O8 as coreactant. Taking advantage of both MIP-ECL assays and the strong electrochemiluminescence emission of EuS NCs, the sensitive and selective HIV gene detection has been achieved in a linear range 3.0 fM to 0.3 nM with a detection limit of 0.3 fM. The present MIP-ECL biosensor showed good specificity for HIV DNA detection compared to non-complementary and two bases mismatched sequences. The proposed ECL biosensor was applied to detect of HIV DNA in real human serum samples and satisfactory results were obtained. Due to high sensitivity and selectivity, excellent reproducibility and stability of the proposed assay, EuS NCs can be used as novel luminophore for development of MIP-ECL sensors for detection of other DNA biomarkers.

AB Rapidity and high sensitivity are the critical factors for the diagnoses of heart attacks and cardiac troponin I (cTnI) is used as a gold standard marker for its diagnosis. To realize the accurate detection of cTnI, a novel ultrasensitive photoelectrochemical (PEC) immunosensor for cTnI determination was developed upon dual inhibition effect of Ag@Cu2O core-shell submicron-particles(SPs) toward CdS sensitized the (001) facets of anatase titanium dioxide nanosheets (TiO2/CdS). In this study, the TiO2/CdS composite not only indicated stable and excellent photoelectric signal but also provided abundant functional group to immobilized cTnI antibodies (Ab(1)). To obtain the high sensitivity, Ag@Cu2O core-shell SPs were used as labels of the secondary antibodies (Ab(2)), owning to competitive absorption of light and consumption of electron donor, less light energy and electron donors arrived at the TiO2/CdS sensitization structure. Besides, the remarkable steric hindrance effect of Ag@Cu2O core-shell SPs labeled secondary antibodies (Ab(2)) conjugates obstructed the transfer of electrons and diffusion of the electron donors to the photoelectrode surface, leading to further decrease of photocurrent. Therefore, the constructed immunosensor has an ultrasensitive response to cTnI in a liner range of 0.02 pg/mL to 50 ng/mL with a low detection limit of 6.7 fg/mL, and exhibits good sensitivity and admirable stability. Moreover, the strategy provided an efficient and novel approach for dual inhibition effect in PEC immunoassay development.

AB A fiber optic surface plasmon resonance (FOSPR) sensor was developed for detection of Escherichia coli O157:H7 (E. coli O157:H7) in water and juice, based on antimicrobial peptides (AMP), Magainin I, as recognition elements and silver nanoparticles-reduced graphene oxide (AgNPs-rGO) nanocomposites assisted signal amplification. The uniform AgNPs-rGO was fixed on the surface of optical fiber and covered with gold film. Not only was the SPR response greatly enhanced, but also the AgNPs was prevented from being oxidized. The FOSPR showed a sensitivity of about 1.5 times higher than that fabricated only with gold film. In the assay, Magainin I, immobilized on the surface of gold film, could specifically capture E. coli O157:H7, resulting in the wavelength shift of the SPR absorption peak. Under the optimized conditions, the SPR resonance wavelength exhibited a good linear relationship with natural logarithm of the target bacteria concentration in the range of 1.0 x 10(3) to 5.0 x 10(7) cfu/mL with the detection limit of 5.0 x 10(2) cfu/mL (S/N = 3). The FOSPR sensor showed good specificity for E. coli O157:H7 detection compared to other bacteria similar to the target bacterial species. Furthermore, the FOSPR sensor was successfully applied to the detection of E. coli O157:H7 in water, fruit and vegetable juice with the satisfactory recoveries of 88-110%. This assay for E. coli O157:H7 detection possesses high sensitivity, good selectivity, reproducibility and stability. In addition, the AMP based SPR biosensing methodology could be extended to detect a wide variety of foodborne pathogens. Therefore, the versatile method might become a potential alternative tool in food analysis and early clinical diagnosis.

AB Cardiac issues are always one of major health problems that attract wide attention by the public. It is urgent to explore a preclinical strategy to efficiently prevent the life-threatening arrhythmias by precisely assessing the cardiac excitation-contraction behavior. Conventional label-free asynchronous strategies are difficult to synchronously record and precisely match the excitation and contraction signals in vitro, while label-based strategies generally present pharmacological adverse effects and phototoxicity that significantly interfere the natural excitation and contraction signals. Both types of strategies preclude to exactly understand how cardiac excitation -contraction coupling changes in quantitative and coherent detail when dysfunctions occur. Here, we show a label-free synchronized electromechanical integration detection strategy that can synchronously monitor electrical and mechanical signals of cardiomyocytes over a long period of time by an integrated microelectrodeinter-digitated electrode (ME-IDE). ME-IDE can detect subtle changes in electromechanical integration signals induced by drugs that target excitation-contraction coupling. Moreover, electromechanical integration delay is explored to specifically recognize the sodium channel inhibition. Furthermore, biomimetic electronic pacemaker function provides an alternative way to efficiently assess the drug-induced arrhythmia using refractory period of cardiomyocytes.

AB Amino acids (AAs) of nutritional importance exist as L-isomers, while D-isomeric form of AAs is common constituent of bacterial cell wall. The presence of D-amino acids in foods is promoted by harsh technological processes (e.g., high temperature, extreme pH, adulteration or microbial contamination). The detection of free AAs in different brain disorders is also very important. Among the various methods available for detection of AAs, most are complicated and require time-consuming sample pre-treatment, expensive instrumental set-up and trained persons to operate, specifically for chromatographic methods. The biosensing methods overcome these drawbacks, as these are simple, fast, specific and highly sensitive and can also be applied for detection of AAs in vivo. This review presents the principles, merits and demerits of various analytical methods for AA determination with special emphasis on D-amino acids (DAA) and L-amino acids (LAA) biosensors. The electrochemical AA biosensors work optimally within 2-900 s, pH range, 5.3-9.5; temperature range, 25-45 degrees C; AA concentration range, 0.0008-8000 mM, limit of detection(LOD) between 0.02 and 1250 mu M and working potential from -0.05 to 0.45 V. These biosensors measured AA level in fruit juices, beverages, urine, sera and were reused 200 times over a period of 7-120 days. The use of various nanostructures and electrochemical microfluidic paper based analytical device (E mu PAD) are suggested for further development of AA biosensors.

AB Paper-based lateral-flow assay (LFA) is a simple and inexpensive point-of-care device that has become commonplace in medicine, environmental monitoring, and over-the-counter personal use. Some LFAs have demonstrated comparable analytical performance with laboratory-based methods, but the detection limit or sensitivity of most LFAs is significantly inferior to other molecular techniques by 10-100 x. Consequently, LFAs are not viable for the early detection of disease-relevant biomarkers that are present in extremely small amounts in clinical specimens. Herein, we present a simple, cost-effective, and highly sensitive LFA sensor based on photothermal laser speckle imaging (PT-LSI). Under the illumination of a photothermal excitation light, gold nanoparticles (AuNPs), a common signal transduction medium in LFAs, absorb the light energy to produce heat, which subsequently induces modulation of the optical property and thermal deformation of the membrane. We measured these fluctuations through laser speckle imaging to quantify the concentration of AuNP-biomarker complexes. We experimentally demonstrate that the detection limit of our technique is superior to that of colorimetric detector by 68-125 x. The capability of our sensor for highly sensitive detection of disease biomarkers is validated by using U.S. FDA-approved LFA kits for cryptococcal antigens (CrAg).

AB In this work, we aimed to propose a newly synthesized composite material with enhanced electrocatalytic properties as a novel screen-printed sensor for the quantification of NADH. Additionally, the surface was modified with alcohol dehydrogenase for the preparation of an amperometric biosensor for analysis of ethanol. Synthesized material was characterized using several microstructural (FE-SEM, HR-TEM, XRD) and electrochemical (CV, EIS) techniques. The electrochemical response of the tested analytes was investigated as a function of important parameters. Under optimal conditions, the working linear range and limit of detection for ethanol sensing was 1-1800 mu M and 0.19 mu M, respectively. For NADH, the linear range was from 1 to 1300 mu M with limit of detection of 0.52 mu M. Moreover, effects of some possible interfering compounds were investigated and the developed procedure was applied to commercial alcoholic beverages. The results obtained showed satisfactory precision and accuracy of the developed method and confirm the proposed approach could be a possible replacement for the currently used techniques for ethanol and NADH quantification.

AB Sensitive detection of cancer cells is beneficial to the early diagnosis of cancer and individual treatment. In the present study, a DNA nanostructured aptasensor was used for the sensitive electrochemical detection of human liver hepatocellular carcinoma cells (HepG2) based on multibranched hybridization chain reaction amplification strategy. We established a well-designed platform by immobilizing DNA tetrahedron, a three-dimensional DNA nanostructure, on the gold electrode to capture HepG2 cells more specifically and efficiently. Meanwhile, functional hybrid nanoprobes consisted of MIL-101@AuNPs (Au nanoparticles), numerous hemin/G-quadruplex DNAzyme from multibranched hybridization chain reaction, and natural horseradish peroxidase (HRP) was designed. The hybrid nanoprobes possessed the functions of specific discernment and enzymatic signal amplification simultaneously. With the help of nanoprobes, HepG2 cells were recognized and captured to form a DNA tetrahedron-cell-nanoprobe sandwich-like structure on the electrode surface. The lower detection limit of this established cytosensor is 5 cells per ml. Moreover, it delivered a broad detection range from 10(2) to 10(7) cells per ml. The results revealed that the as-proposed cytosensor may be utilized as a powerful tool for early diagnosis of cancer in the future.

AB Procalcitonin (PCT) is an important indicator for bacterial inflammatory diseases, and its sensitive, accurate and rapid detection has important clinical value. On the basis of sandwich immunoassay, glucose oxidase-catalyzed gold deposition and in-situ microliter-droplet anodic stripping voltammetry (ASV) of the enzyme-generated gold directly on the immunoelectrode, the ultrasensitive electrochemical detection of PCT is achieved. A new method of the chemical dissolution of gold by an appropriately diluted aqua regia and the simultaneous cathodic pre-concentration of gold on the immunoelectrode is suggested, which gives the better performance for the ASV analysis of gold than the reported one. Under optimized conditions, the ASV peak current is linear with the common logarithm of PCT concentration from 0.05 fg mL(-1) to 500 ng mL(-1), with a limit of detection (LOD, S/N = 3) as low as 0.04 fg mL(-1). Our method has also been used for detection of PCT in serum samples with satisfactory results.
