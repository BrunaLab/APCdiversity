AB To substantially simplify the fabrication of analytical devices for rapid screening tests, in this study we employed multi-material fused deposition modeling-type three-dimensional printing (3DP) and two functionalized thermoplastic filaments-acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) incorporating peroxidase-mimicking iron oxide (Fe3O4) nanoparticles and polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) infiltrated with the chromogenic substrate o-phenylenediamine (OPD)-for the one-step manufacture of enzyme/substrate-incorporated multi-well plates. Upon contact with samples, these fabricated devices (i) released the chromogenic substrate OPD into the solution, (ii) efficiently catalyzed the oxidation of OPD mediated by the peroxidase substrate H2O2, (iii) enabled assays of those substances availably oxidized by their specific oxidases to generate H2O2, and (iv) facilitated colorimetric observation by the naked eye or through absorbance measurements after loading into a microplate reader. With glucose oxidase immobilized in each well, samples appropriately diluted could be directly loaded for derivatizing and analyzing glucose without adding any other reagents. After assay optimization, the limits of detection reached as low as 2.8 mu M for H2O2 and 5.0 mu(M) for glucose; the method's applicability was illustrated in terms of determining glucose concentrations in urine, serum, and plasma samples. These 3D-printed peroxidase mimic/chromogenic substrate-incorporated multi-well plates appear to be highly suitable for rapid and high-throughput screening of glucose in clinical samples. We demonstrate that adequate functionalization of raw materials for 3DP can contribute to the development of novel multifunctional devices with many potential practical applications.

AB New dual electrochemical and fluorescence sensitive curcumin-graphene quantum dots sensing platform coated on the transparent Indium-Tin-Oxide electrode was developed to sense APOe4 DNA, responsible of Alzheimer's disease. Curcumin molecule with its dual fluorescence and electrochemical properties was electropolymerized on GQDs-ITO surface. EDC/NHS chemistry was used to covalently immobilize an amino-substituted DNA probe via a malonic acid spacer. Quenching of curcumin signals following hybridized DNA complex was employed to quantify APOe4 DNA. Amperometric studies revealed an ul-trasensitive behavior toward the formation of DNA complex with a sensitivity of 4.74 nA.mL.pg (-1) and a limit of detection as low as 0.48 pg mL (-1). The platform exhibits very good performances such as repeatability, reproducibility, selectivity and long storage stability. Fluorescence results were established for the support and the complementarity of electrochemical results. Founded results confirmed the ultrasensitivity of platform with comparable performances. Recorded results in human blood plasma demonstrated the high efficacy of curcumin system sensing even in the clinical matrix. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this study, we proposed a novel anti-aggregation of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) strategy for colorimetric sensing of iodide ions (I-) regulated by the redox reaction between the target ions and the ion cross-linking agent. Cu2+ as interlinking ion can induce aggregation of arginine capped AuNPs (Arg-AuNPs) due to the formation of Arg-Cu2+-Arg analogous structure resulting from the chelation between Cu2+ and arginine, with a clear color change of solution from red to blue. In the presence of I-, however, Cu2+ would be readily reduced owing to the formation of CuI, AuNPs underwent a transformation from an aggregation to a dispersion state depending on the concentration of I-, leading color changes from blue to red. The corresponding color variation in the process of anti-aggregation of AuNPs can be monitored through UV-vis spectrophotometer or by the naked-eye, making quantitative analysis of I- feasible in a convenient colorimetric or visual way. The assay only took 5 min, showing high sensitivity with a lowest detectable concentration of 10 nM and excellent selectivity for I- over other anions tested, which was successfully applied for the detection of I- in drinking water and table salt samples.

AB Phytophthora infestans, the causal agent of late blight in potatoes and tomatoes, is the most important and ongoing pathogenic threat to agricultural production worldwide. Rapid and early identification of P. infestans is an essential prerequisite for countering the further spread of infection. In this study, a novel method for visual detection of P. infestans has been developed by integrating universal primer mediated asymmetric PCR with gold nanoparticle (AuNP)-based lateral flow biosensor. We employed asymmetric PCR to generate large amounts of single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) by amplifying a region of P. infestans-specific repetitive DNA sequence. The ssDNA products were then applied to the lateral flow biosensor to perform a visual detection using sandwich-type hybridization assays. In the presence of target DNA, sandwich-type hybridization reactions among the AuNP-probe, target DNA and capture probe were performed on the test line of the biosensor, and then a characteristic red band was produced for the accumulation of AuNPs. Quantitative analysis obtained by recording the optical intensity of the red band demonstrated that this biosensor could detect as little as 0.1 pg mu L-1 genomic DNA. Furthermore, the specificity of the biosensor was confirmed by detecting three other Phytophthora species and two pathogenic fungi. We believe this method has potential application in early prediction of potato late blight disease and instigation of management actions to reduce the risk of epidemic development.

AB Aromatic stationary phases showing complementary selectivity to their alkyl counterparts are extremely useful for certain challenging separation tasks. Herein, a series of polar-embedded aryl stationary phases were synthesized from reactive derivatives of large polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), including anthracene (three-ring, catacondensed), pyrene (four-ring, pericondensed) and triphenylene (four-ring, fully-benzenoid). These PAHs were functionalized with hydroxymethyl group (PAH-CH2OH), then catalytically converted to carbamates (PAH-CH2OC(=O) NH-R) using isocyanate, and finally covalently grafted onto silica to produce corresponding carbamate-embedded PAH stationary phases. To gain insight into the connection and difference among the attached species, the chromatographic behaviors of these new adsorbents were systematically evaluated in terms of surface coverage, hydrophobic and aromatic features, shape selectivity and charge-transfer property, using different classes of analytes, such as alkyl-benzenes, PAH congeners and isomeric multi-substituted benzenes, and the results were further compared with conventional octadecyl ones (C18). The relationships between the shape selectivity and the surface chemistry revealed unique behavioral patterns of theses immobilized conjugated ligands, as well as marked differences amongst them, which formed sharp contrast to the case of C18. The effects of temperature and mobile phase compositions on the shape selectivity were further studied. The charge-transfer characteristics demonstrated the great potential of such polar-embedded PAH materials for highly selective separation of electron-deficient compounds through electron donor-acceptor complexation.

AB The chiral analysis of enantiomers is important because bioactivity can depend strongly on stereochemistry as ligand-protein binding motifs are typically chiral. Ion mobility mass spectrometry-based methods are emerging for the rapid and sensitive chiral analysis of molecules. However, such methods are typically limited by the use of metal-bound trimers, which can be challenging to form owing to ion suppression and the need for extensive pre-screening experiments to identify suitable metal ions. Moreover, the chiral separation of very small molecules, such as cysteine and proline, using ion mobility has remained challenging. Here, using electrospray ionisation high-resolution differential ion mobility mass spectrometry (ESI-DMS-MS), we demonstrate that the enantiomers of benchmark amino acids as small as proline can be rapidly distinguished without the use of metal ions for the first time. ESI-DMS-MS of proton-bound diastereomeric dimer complexes, containing enantiomers of amino acids and a 'chiral selector' (N-tert-butoxycarbonyl-O-benzyl-L-serine; BBS) corresponding to [L/D-X(BBS) +H](+) (X = cysteine and proline) resulted in the separation of L and D-enantiomers. By use of DMS-MS and standard solutions of chiral mixtures, these data indicate that the enantiomeric excess of proline can be accurately quantified by differential ion mobility mass spectrometry. Overall, these results provide further evidence that DMS-MS can be used for the rapid and accurate 'metal-ion free' chiral analysis of many other biologically important molecules.

AB A new maltose modified polymer-silica composite was fabricated and applied as high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) stationary phase. The cross-linked poly glycidyl methacrylate (pGMA) layer was chemically bonded to the outer surface as well as pore inner surface of silica beads via in-situ polymerization, and then maltose was modified onto the polymer layer via a [3 + 2] "click" reaction. The porous spherical silica (4 mu m diameter) with 300 A pore size was selected as the matrix so that the 3.25 nm-thick polymer layer fabricated on the pore inner surface would not affect its permeability. The typical 'U-shape' retention curves indicated a mixed-mode retention mechanism of the as-synthesized stationary phase. Both polar and non-polar analytes could be well separated on the stationary phase with column efficiency reaching 123809 plates/m for guanosine in hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC) mode and 46808 plates/m for fluorene in reversed-phase liquid chromatography (RPLC) mode, respectively. Nucleotides and their bases were baseline separated with good peak shape without any buffer salt in mobile phase, suggesting the effective shielding of the silanol groups. The packing material also showed excellent chromatographic repeatability with intraday RSDs of the retention time of five nucleosides less than 0.048% (n = 3) and interday RSDs less than 0.33% (n = 7) and great pH stability (from 1.5 to 10.2). Finally, the stationary phase was applied to the separation of ginseng extract. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

We measure functionalization uniformity along the column by (a) separately measuring capacities of two halves of a column, (b) measuring retention factors for several ions in successive 10 cm segments of a column in multiple injections and (c) measuring retention variance of a single ion in different segments of a column from a single injection. Data were collected in both flow directions. Errors in CEX capacity determination arises primarily from uncertainties in titration end point location. AEX capacities are typically 10x higher, reducing the relative measurement error. In the AEX case, both titration end point location error and variations in column internal diameter contribute to the overall uncertainty. Although sulfonation of COP results in nonuniform CEX functionalization, AEX latex coating of this surface results in uniform AEX coverage. Frontal displacement chromatography (using both admittance and optical detection) and acid-base titrimetry were compared for capacity measurement. In a pooled standard deviation based t-test for the data on 8 columns, at the 95% confidence level, CEX capacity differed significantly between two halves of a column. But AEX capacity of AEX columns prepared by coating the same CEX columns with AEX latex did not. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Metabolite profiling can be used as a diagnostic measure for both short and long term co-exposure by individuals to benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and xylenes (BTEX). A novel one pot derivatization in situ kit (OPDISK) was developed and optimized using a multivariate approach based on central composite design. The OPDISK was designed to simultaneously derivatize, in a urine sample matrix, a series of fourteen carboxylic acid and phenol-bearing urinary metabolites of BTEX to enhance their chromatographic analysis and sensitivity for detection by liquid chromatography - electrospray ionization - tandem mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-MS/MS). Using the reagent kit, the less responsive functional units on the molecules were converted to permanently positively-charged functional units. The kit was composed of three components, 2-fluoro-1-methylpyridinium p-toluenesulfonate (FMP), 3-carbinol-1-methylpyridinium iodide (CMP) and triethylamine (TEA) as a basic catalyst and, only after diluting a urine sample 20 fold with acetonitrile, was applied under mild conditions of room temperature and short reaction time of 20 min. The derivatized biomarkers were then directly analyzed using isotope dilution LC-ESI-MS/MS. The method was sensitive (limit of detection on column ranged from 1.4 pg to 3.1 ng), accurate (mean accuracy from 85% to 114%), and precise (mean coefficient of variation from 1% to 14%). The method results indicated a good linearity (R-2 >= 0.990) for all metabolites. ClinChek (R) urine control samples were used successfully to demonstrate the accuracy of the method.

AB Proanthocyanidins as well as other secondary metabolites present in green cocoa beans were studied thanks to a new method involving the use of on-line comprehensive two-dimensional liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (LC x LC-MS/MS). In order to enhance the performance of previously developed methodologies, the use of different modulation strategies were explored. Focusing modulation clearly allowed the attainment of higher resolving power and peak capacity compared to non-focusing modulation set-ups. Moreover, the use of active modulation by the addition of a make-up flow efficiently helped to compensate for the solvent strength mismatch produced between dimensions. The optimized method was useful to successfully describe the secondary metabolite composition of green cocoa that was characterized by the presence of 30 main compounds, including 3 xanthines, 2 flavan-3-ols and 24 oligomeric procyanidins with a degree of polymerization up to 12. The obtained results showed that the proanthocyanidins found in the cocoa beans were exclusively B-type procyanidins. The existence of (epi) catechin subunits linked to sugar or galloyl moieties was not observed. The developed method produced a good separation of secondary metabolites allowing an improvement with respect to the available methodologies for the analysis of a complex food sample such as cocoa metabolites in terms of speed of analysis, resolution and peak capacity.

AB This tutorial review is a critical commentary on the combined use of two instrumental analytical techniques, namely GC-MS and PTR-MS. The first mention of such an analytical approach likely appeared after the year 2000 and despite many advantages, it has not been applied very often. Therefore, the aim of this article is to elaborate on the concept of their combined use and to provide a curse tutorial for those considering taking such an approach. The issue of complementarity was raised in a broad sense of this term. Special emphasis was placed on indicating the possibilities of complementary utilization of GC-MS and PTR-MS and presenting the advantages and disadvantages as well as the current application of these techniques when used together.

AB This work presents the highly-sensitive detection of 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT) on reduced graphene oxide/multi-walled carbon nanotube (rGO/MWCNT) nanocomposite sensor. The formation of a thin film of this nanocomposite occurred at the cyclohexane/water immiscible interface of a mixture of MWCNT and rGO in the biphasic solution. The film was transferred to a boron-doped diamond (BDD) electrode for the square-wave voltammetric detection of TNT, which presented improved analytical characteristics in comparison with bare BDD and after modification with precursors. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy also revealed the faster electron transfer for a redox probe on the nanocomposite modified surface. The synergistic properties of both carbon nanomaterials in the thin film modified surface resulted in a TNT sensor with a detection limit of 0.019 mu mol L-1 within a wide linear range (0.5-1100 mu mol L-1), with superior performance in comparison with other electrochemical sensors produced with carbon nanomaterials. This new material provides great promises for the highly-sensitive detection of other nitroaromatic explosives as well as other analytes. Moreover, the interfacial method enables the production of homogeneous and stable films on large coated areas as well as the large-scale production of electrochemical sensors. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB New insight into the preparation of sensitive carbon-based electrochemical electrode is provided by examining the properties of thermally reduced graphene oxide (TRGO). In this paper, TRGO was prepared by thermal reduction of graphene oxide (GO) in argon atmosphere, and characterized by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), selected area electron diffraction (SAED), and atomic force microscopy (AFM). Results showed that thermal reduction in argon was effective to remove oxygen-containing functional groups in GO, and graphene sheets were obtained. Furthermore, TRGO was used to prepare thermally reduced graphene oxide paste electrode (TRGOPE) which showed excellent conductivity and fast electron transfer kinetics confirmed by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and cyclic voltammetry (CV). The electrode was applied to determination of the pesticide naptalam (Nap) in square-wave voltammetric (SWV) mode. The corresponding current at approx. +1.0 V increased linearly with the Nap concentration within two linear dynamic ranges (LDR) of 0.1-1.0 mu mol L-1 (LDR1) and 1.0-10.0 mu mol L-1 (LDR2). The limits of detection (LOD) and quantification (LOQ) for Nap were calculated as 0.015 mu mol L-1 and 0.051 mu mol L-1, respectively. In comparison to the carbon paste electrode (CPE) the results showed that the TRGOPE possesses advantages in terms of linearity, sensitivity and detectability. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB Four analytical techniques are compared: AGNES (Absence of Gradients and Nernstian Equilibrium Stripping), LASV (Anodic Stripping Voltammetry with Linear stripping), DGT (Diffusive Gradients in Thin films) and PIM (Polymer Inclusion Membranes). These techniques have been designed to provide the free ion concentration or a labile fraction, complementarily contributing to an integrated description of speciation and availability. Their simultaneous application to the determination of free Zn concentrations or labile fluxes in seven solutions of a hydroponic medium reveals characteristics of each technique and correlations between their results. All dynamic results can be interpreted in terms of a general theoretical framework on fluxes. Indeed, in techniques under diffusion-limited conditions in the sample, the flux can be split into the free contribution (linearly proportional to the free fraction), plus the contribution of the complexes (where mobility, lability and abundance of complexation are intertwined). A methodology to compute lability degrees is developed. Measurements with PIM devices confirm that diffusion in the sample solution is not rate limiting, so its flux is proportional to the free metal in the donor solution. A proportionality between the responses of any given two techniques is observed, which suggests that, for the low ligand-to-metal concentration ratios used in the present work, any of these techniques would correlate similarly with uptake, toxic or nutritional measurements.

AB In this study two methods including coating carbon nanotubes (CNTs) layers on the electrode surface and adding CNTs-suspension during electrochemically active biofilms (EABs) growth were used, respectively, to develop CNTs hybrid EABs for enhancing electricity generation capability of EABs. EABs growth on the CNTs with functional groups of hydroxyl (CNTs-OH) or carboxyl (CNTs-COOH) and pristine CNTs without functionalization (P-CNTs) modified electrode was investigated. The maximum current densities of EABs growth on the P-CNTs, CNTs-OH and CNTs-COOH coated electrode were respective 1300 +/- 117, 1082 +/- 54 and 1124 +/- 78 mu A cm(-2), which were much higher than unmodified electrode (663 mu A cm(-2)). Meanwhile, EABs growth in doping CNTs-COOH or CNTs-OH suspensions system also produced twice higher current density than that on unmodified electrode. These results indicated that the current production of EABs can be significantly enhanced by coating P-CNTs, CNTs-OH, CNTs-COOH layers on the electrode surface or doping CNTs-OH and CNTs-COOH suspension into EABs. Furthermore, morphology analysis of as-obtained EABs had also been studied. It was found that there was no significant difference of the morphological characteristic for EABs growth on different types CNTs coated electrode surface. By comparison, a nano-hybrid porous structure of CNTs and EABs was observed when CNTs-COOH or CNTs-OH suspension was added into the medium during EABs growth, which will be responsible for high current generation.

AB This work describes the development of a new selective photocontrollable molecularly imprinted-based sorbent for the selective enrichment/pre-concentration of dimethoate from spiked olive oil samples. To achieve this goal an improved molecularly imprinted strategy relying on the embedding of a functional monomer containing an azobenzene chromophore as light-responsive element, on the crosslinked tridimensional molecular imprinted network, has been assessed. To address the mechanisms underlying template recognition and uptake/release of the analyte from the functional imprinted material, computational studies using a quantum chemical approach, have been explored. This new functional sorbent provides a straightforward controllable uptake/release of the target template using light as the stimuli tool, which is highly advantageous due to light manipulation characteristics, such as superior clean, precision and remote controllable properties. In general, this work will contribute to the implementation of a photoswitchable analytical methodology that proves to be suitable for the selective isolation and further quantification of dimethoate from olive oil matrices at levels similar to the maximum residues limits imposed by the legislation. The limits of detection, calculated based on 3 sigma, was 1.6 mgL(-1) and the limit of quantification, based on 10 sigma, was 5.2 mgL(-1). The implemented sample preparation shows high reproducibility and recoveries (93.3 +/- 0.4%). (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB An artificial receptor approach for proteins capture and release was designed based on ionic-sensitive and thermo-sensitive functionalized polymers, which were modified onto the surface of magnetic nanoparticles. The dual-functional poly(styrene-sulfonate-N-isopropylacrylamide) (P(SS-NIPAm)) was synthesized via the free radical polymerization method and used as the artificial receptor with electrostatic, hydrophilic and hydrophobic properties. The affinity between the artificial receptor and lysozyme was investigated using high performance liquid chromatography. Arising from the strong and specific interactions between the negatively charged sulfonic acid groups of P(SS-NIPAm) and positively charged amino groups of the protein, the prepared artificial receptor exhibited outstanding affinity for lysozyme. Interestingly, due to the thermo-responsive and ionic strength-responsive features of the prepared P(SS-NIPAm), the capture and release process for lysozyme could be modulated by varying the environmental temperature and ionic strength. Further, the proposed artificial receptor based on P(SS-NIPAm) modification of magnetic nanoparticles surface was used for affinity capture of lysozyme in human serum with a recovery ranging from 89.9% to 100.4%, paving a new way for synthesis of artificial receptors and showing great potential for recognition of target protein in real bio-samples.

AB A novel fully automated liquid-phase microextraction (LPME) procedure making use of a conical polypropylene membrane bag to hold the solvent, coupled with ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS) with positive electrospray ionisation was developed to determine glucocorticoids (including cortisol, cortisone, dexamethasone, prednisone and prednisolone) in water. The solvent was a synergistic mixture of 10% v/v of ionic liquid, 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium methylsulfate in n-octanol. The use of ionic liquid as an additive enhanced the extraction performance due to the favourable ionic and hydrogen bonding interactions with the analytes. Different experimental parameters such as the types of organic solvent as supported liquid membrane and ionic liquid, various composition of ionic liquid, volume of extractant phase, agitation time and speed, temperature of extraction were investigated. Under the most favourable extraction conditions, enrichment factors of 49.4-83.1 were obtained for the target compounds with relative standard deviations of <10%. The intra-day repeatability of the method ranged from 4.23 to 6.42% and the inter-day reproducibility ranged from 6.87 to 9.20%. Good linearity 0.05-50 ng mL(-1) (prednisolone) and 0.1 -50 ng mL(-1) (all other analytes) with coefficients of determination of 0.991 or better, was obtained. The membrane bag-assisted-LPME UHPLC-MS/MS approach exhibited high sensitivity, linearity and repeatability for the extraction of the glucocorticoids and also offered an automated streamlined process, from the point where analytes were extracted, to the final analysis of the water samples. The method was employed to determine the concentration of these contaminants in the influent and effluent of a wastewater treatment plant. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Carotenoid cleavage products (apocarotenoids; APOs) exert important biological functions in light perception and as vitamin A source, signaling molecules, hormone precursors, pigments and volatiles. However, an analytical method that allows simultaneous profiling of these diverse compounds is still missing. We developed an efficient method to analyze APOs present in plant tissues, which is based on ultra-high performance liquid chromatographic separation and high-resolution hybrid quadrupole-Orbitrap (Q-Orbitrap) mass spectrometry (MS). Our approach allowed unambiguous identification and quantification of volatile and non-volatile APOs in a single run. Modified sample preparation and optimized ultra-high performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC)-MS parameters permitted the measurement of APOs in Oryza sativa seedlings and Spinacia oleracea leaves, unraveling 20 endogenous APOs with chain lengths ranging from C-10 to C-30, confirmed by high-resolution MS, MS/MS data and using synthetic standards. Our experimentation demonstrates that the usage of methanol with 0.1% butylated hydroxytoluene facilitates the extraction of both short-chain and long-chain APOs from plant materials. In addition, our validated analytical method allows the quantitative analysis of APOs with a wide content range from 2.5 pg/mg to 10 ng/mg dried weight. The adoption of the analytical protocol, as described in this study, realizes the measurement of volatile APOs by using a LC-MS method, hence, allowing informative and reliable profiling of APOs, which is important for determining the content of these compounds in food and crucial for understanding their function and metabolism in plants.

AB Untargeted metabolomics studies aim to extract a broad coverage of metabolites from biological samples, which largely depends on the sample preparation protocols used for metabolite extraction. The aim of this study was to evaluate a comprehensive sample pretreatment strategy using two-step liquid-liquid extraction to achieve broader metabolome coverage by ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with electrospray ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-Q-TOF-MS). We compared four protocols: (A) methanol protein precipitation, (B) Ostro 96-well plates, (C) two-step extraction protocol of CHCL3-MeOH followed by MeOH-H2O, and (D) two-step extraction protocol of CH2CL2-MeOH followed by MeOH-H2O. The number of extracted features, reproducibility and recovery were the major criteria for evaluation. Our results demonstrated that Protocols B, C and D, with approximately similar number of features, extracted more features than Protocol A. Protocols C and D appeared to have similar extraction reproducibility (low coefficient of variation < 30%) and Protocol D enabled an acceptable recovery of serum metabolites. The two-step extraction Protocol D (CH2CL2-MeOH followed by MeOH-H2O) resulted in the greatest improvement in metabolite coverage, satisfactory extraction reproducibility, acceptable recovery and environmental safety. The selected protocol was applied to an obesity metabolomics study to obtain different metabolites between participants with obesity and the controls, and to investigate complex metabolic alterations in obesity during a 2-h oral glucose-tolerance test. Our results suggested that this protocol was useful for analyzing serum metabolome changes in obese individuals in the fasting and postprandial state. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Knowledge of blood triacylglycerol (TAG) species is essential to clarify the physiological functions of individual TAG molecules and also to develop potential biomarkers for related diseases. Commonly, lipid samples prepared by organic liquid-liquid extraction contain complex components, thus cannot be directly characterized by mass spectrometry (MS) and often require an additional purification step. Here, we described a laser desorption ionization - mass spectrometry (LDI-MS) method that utilized aggregated graphene oxide (AGO) as both lipid extractant and MS matrix (AGOLDI-MS), to characterize and quantify plasma TAG species without the use of harmful solvent or complex separation step. We first designed and synthesized the AGO material with a multi-layered sheet structure, which could efficiently break up the structure of lipoproteins, and extract plasma TAGs as solid-phase extraction material. Furthermore, in AGOLDI-MS procedure, the AGO could directly act as matrix and selectively produce the MS signals of TAGs without the interferences of phospholipids, which was hardly achieved by using the routine LDI-MS method based on liquid-liquid extraction and small molecular matrix. We confirmed the suitability of AGOLDI-MS as characterization and quantitative tool for TAG species through studying the analysis performances in TAG standards and real plasma samples. To establish potential utility of our method, we characterized 42 human plasmas from healthy and hyperlipemic donators, indicating that the AGOLDI-MS could not only generate comparable quantitative results of total TAGs to current clinical technology, but also monitor the changes of TAG species between different sample groups. This approach could further characterize the compositions of the fatty acid moieties in even low abundant TAGs by the assistance of tandem MS-MS. This concise, specific, and high-throughput approach will facilitate the rapid and precise characterizations of plasma TAGs, and make the MS approach for TAGs more adaptable for clinical uses.

AB Taste and odor (T&O) compounds are widespread in water environments and have attracted considerable public attention. Nowadays, the standard detections of these chemicals rely mainly on off-line methods such as GC-MS or evaluation by trained analysts' senses. In this study, we report a method for the rapid detection of T&O compounds in water by exploiting a newly invented chemi-ionization source, in combination with headspace vapor measurement at room temperature. The calibrated limits of detection (LODs) of 2-methylbutyraldehyde, methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE), methyl methacrylate (MMA), 2-isobutyl-3-methyoxypyrazine (IBMP), and 2-isopropyl-3-methoxypyrazine (IPMP) are in the range of 3.5-50.2 ng L-1, and the estimated LODs of 2-methylisoborneol (2-MIB) and geosmin (GSM) are 0.25 and 0.77 ng L-1, respectively. The calibration results reveal that the instrumental LODs for 2-methylbutyraldehyde, MTBE, MMA, beta-cyclocitral, 2-MIB, and GSM are 1-2 orders of magnitude better than the odor thresholds of humans. The accuracy, precision, recovery, and linearity (R-2) of the method are tested. Water samples from city tap water and three rivers in Beijing are assessed using this technique, and the typical T&O compositions are observed with concentrations ranging from 0.2 to 297 ng L-1. The new ultra-sensitive rapid detection method shows comparable sensitivities to the existing off-line technique and displays great potential for real-time detection of T&O pollution in water environments.

AB A sensitive full-automated micromagnetic particles (MMPs) based competitive chemiluminescent immunoassay (CLIA) was developed to detect cortisol in milk. Polyclonal antibody (pAb) with good specificity against cortisol was produced. The antigen (cortisol-OVA) was labeled with acridinium ester (cortisol-OVA-AE) as signal tracer. During the detection, the free cortisol in sample will compete with cortisol-OVA-AE for binding to pAb. To capture pAb, MMPs conjugated with goat anti-rabbit IgG was added. The whole immunoassay process (exclude sample pretreatment) was performed by automatic chemiluminescence immunoassay instrument, which could consume less test time (within 40 min) and avoid error from manual operation. The method showed a good detection limit of 0.12 ng/mL, a broad linear range from 0.42 to 72.27 ng/mL for cortisol detection, negligible cross-reactivity with related analogues and satisfied recovery (84.3%-102.3%) for spiked milk samples test. Simultaneously, since the results of proposed method had no significant difference with those of LC-MS/MS, the proposed method was confirmed to have a potential applicability for rapidly monitoring cortisol in the food.

AB ZnAgInS quaternary quantum dots were prepared using glutathione as the capped reagent. Gold nanoparticles (GNPs) were integrated with ZnAgInS QDs to provide a GNPs/ZnAgInS QDs nanocomposite. The morphological image, component and crystal structure of GNPs/ZnAgInS QDs were characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). A glassy carbon electrode surface was coated with GNPs/ZnAgInS QDs nanocomposites to construct an interface for immobilizing the antibody of hepatitis B virus surface antigen (anti-HBsAg). By employing GNPs/ZnAgInS QDs as a photoactive element, a photoelectrochemical immunosensor for hepatitis B virus surface antigen (HBsAg) was developed. The results indicate that gold nanoparticles can dramatically enhance the photocurrent response of ZnAgInS QDs and thus improving the sensing performances of the immunosensor. The experimental conditions including incubation time, incubation temperature, and ascorbic acid concentration were optimized. The relative photocurrent decline [R-i = Delta I/I-0 = (I-0 - I)/I-0] shows a linear relationship to the logarithm of HBsAg concentration [lg(c, ng mL(-1))] in the range from 0.005 to 30 ng mL(-1). A detection limit of 0.5 pg mL(-1) was obtained. The immunosensor shows excellent sensitivity, selectivity, stability and reproducibility. The HBsAg concentrations in clinical serum samples were also accurately determined with this new photoelectrochemical immunosensor. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Over the past few years, nanomaterials-based enzymatic mimics have attracted tremendous attention due to their excellent catalytic activity and environmental stability. In this work, ternary MoS2-polypyrrole (PPy)-Pd nanotubes have been prepared through a hydrothermal reaction and in situ redox polymerization process between pyrrole monomer and Na2PdCl4. The prepared MoS2-PPy-Pd nanotubes exhibited a higher peroxidase-like catalytic activity than individual MoS2, MoS2-PPy, PPy-Pd and MoS2-Pd nanocomposites due to the synergistic catalytic effect between the three components. The catalytic kinetic of MoS2-PPy-Pd nanotubes follows Michaelis-Menten behaviors, exhibiting a good affinity to both 3,3',5,5'-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) and H2O2 substrates. On the basis of high peroxidase-like catalytic efficiency of the MoS2-PPy-Pd nanotubes, a simple and convenient colorimetric strategy for the rapid and sensitive detection of L-cysteine with a detection limit of 0.08 mM has been developed. In addition, a high selectivity towards the detection of L-cysteine is achieved. This work present an opportunity of the prepared ternary MoS2-PPy-Pd nanotubes for promising potential applications in biosensing, environmental monitoring, and medical diagnostics.

AB We report herein a new dual-color fluorescent aptasensor for detection of tumor marker mucin 1 (MUC1) and targeted imaging of MCF-7 cancer cells based on the specific interaction between MUC1 and its aptamer S2.2. The aptasensor was prepared by covalent attachment of the cyanine (Cy5)-tagged aptamer S2.2 to fluorescent silicon nanodot (SiND). The fluorescence of S2.2-Cy5 could be quenched by the SiND carrier in the absence of MUC1, and its fluorescence was restored in the presence of MUC1 due to structure switching of S2.2. This aptasensor exhibits specificity for MUC1-possitive MCF-7 cells rather than MUC1-negative MCF-10A cells and Vero cells. The SiND plays multiple roles in this fluorescence assay, making the method easier compared with other approaches. The limit of detection and precision of this method for MUC1 was 1.52 nM and 3.6% (10 nM, n = 7), respectively. The linear range was 3.33-250 nM, and the recoveries in spiked human serum were in the range of 87-108%. This is a simple, selective, sensitive and reliable method, which can well achieve not only quantitative analysis of tumor marker but also dual-color visualization of single cancer cells.

AB A novel one-and two-photon fluorescent probe based on a photoreaction was developed for the detection of cysteine (Cys). After it was reacted with Cys and illuminated by light, a strong turn-on fluorescence was observed at the excitation of 390 nm. The probe IC-2 was well tolerated at physiological pH conditions and exhibited a fast response rate to Cys within 10 min. Moreover, the probe IC-2 displayed high selectivity towards Cys among other amino acids and metal ions. Fluorescence response studies suggested that the limit of detection of IC-2 was calculated as 2.6 x 10(-8) M. An MTT assay demonstrated that IC-2 had good cell permeability and low cytotoxicity to HepG2 cells. Notably, IC-2 was successfully applied in one-and two-photon fluorescence imaging for Cys in living cells and tissues. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A novel chemiluminescence immunoassay based on luminol-modified gold nanoclusters (AuNCs@Peps@luminol) was developed for simultaneous detection of tetrabromobisphenol A bis(2-hydroxyethyl) ether (TBBPA-DHEE) and tetrabromobisphenol A mono(hydroxyethyl) ether (TBBPA-MHEE), an important derivative and byproduct of tetrabromobisphenol A (TBBPA), respectively. In the system, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) was labeled on the second antibody (Ab(2)) for signal amplification. When ALP-Ab(2) was captured by antigen-primary antibody (Ab(1)) complex, disodium phenyl phosphate (PPNa) generated massive phenol under the catalysis of ALP, markedly inhibiting the chemiluminescence intensity of AuNCs@Peps@luminol. Under the optimized conditions, the calculated detection of limit (LOD, 90% inhibition) was 0.078 mg/L for TBBPA-DHEE with a linear range of 0.23-9.32 mg/L, which was lower 9 times than that of conventional ELISA with the same antibody. In addition, our method showed satisfactory accuracy and precision (recoveries, 88.00-113.4%; CV, 2.75-8.14%), it can be applied to systematically investigate the concentration of the trace TBBPA-DHEE and TBBPA-MHEE in environmental and food samples.

AB Here, a simple electrochemical biosensor was proposed based on the specific recognition between trypsin and peptide. Initially, NiCo2O4-PAMAM nanocomposite was casted on the bare electrode to achieve the electrochemical signal amplification in 0.1 mM [Ru(NH3)(6)](3+) solution owing to the great electronic conductivity and high electrochemical activity induced by the special structure of NiCo2O4 nanosheets (Ni3+ cations in octachedral sites of the Co3O4). Subsequently, a declined electrochemical signal was obtained when g-C3N4 labeled peptide composites were anchored on the electrode. However, after trypsin was added into solution and incubated with the biosensor, the electrochemical signal was re-promoted. Therefore, the as-synthesized biosensor could realize the sensitive detection of trypsin by virtue of the specific recognition between trypsin and peptide. As a result, the developed peptide-based exhibited a linear range from 10(-10) to 10(-4) mg mL(-1) with an ultralow detection limit of 10(-10) mg mL(-1), providing sensitive analytical performance and acceptable application potential in clinical test and disease diagnosis due to its high stability, excellent selectivity, acceptable reproducibility and accurate signal output.

AB A fluorescence aptasensor was constructed for protein kinase (PKA) activity detection by utilizing copper nanoclusters (CuNCs) and polydopamine nanospheres (PDANS). Through the p-p stacking interactions between adenosine triphosphate (ATP) aptamer and PDANS, the ATP aptamer modified CuNCs (apt-CuNCs) were absorbed onto PDANS surface, thus the fluorescence of apt-CuNCs were quenched through fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) from apt-CuNCs to PDANS. In the presence of ATP, ATP specifically bound to aptamer, causing the dissociation of apt-CuNCs from PDANS surface and restoring the fluorescence of apt-CuNCs. However, PKA translated ATP into adenosine diphosphate (ADP), and ADP had no competence to combine with ATP aptamer, thus, apt-CuNCs were released and absorbed onto the PDANS surface to cause the fluorescence quenching of apt-CuNCs again. Therefore, PKA activity was conveniently detected via the fluorescence signal change. Under the optimal conditions, PKA activity was detected in the range of 0.05-4.5 UmL(-1) with a detection limit of 0.021 U mL(-1). Furthermore, the feasibility of the aptasensor for kinase inhibitor screening was explored via assessment of kinase inhibitor H-89 as one model. This aptasensor was also performed for PKA activity determination in HepG2 cell lysates with satisfactory results. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Herein, a simple and efficient fluorescent assay for Ag+ ions and L-cysteine (L-Cys) in complex biological fluids and living cells was first developed based on the fluorescent "on-off-on" mode of red emission nitrogen, boron, sulfur co-doped carbon dots (NBS-CDs). Red emission NBS-CDs were prepared via one-step hydrothermal synthesis by using 3-aminobenzeneboronic acid and 2,5-diaminobenzenesulfonic acid as precursors. Such NBS-CDs exhibited excellent optical properties and relatively high absolute fluorescent quantum yield compared with some reported NBS-CDs. Due to the strong quenching ability of Ag+ ions on the fluorescence of NBS-CDs, red emission NBS-CDs were used for the determination of Ag+ ions with high sensitivity and excellent selectivity. The fluorescence of NBS-CDs was recovered after the interaction between Ag+ ions and L-Cys, which realized the specific determination of L-Cys in human urine samples and human plasma samples. The established NBS-CDs-based fluorescent "on-off-on" sensor offered a relatively low detection limits of 0.35 mu M for Ag+ ions and 0.045 mu M for L-Cys based on three times signal-to-noise criteria. Notably, this strategy was applied for the visual detections of Ag+ ions and L-Cys in living human cancer cells (HeLa cells and MCF-7 cells). This method is simple, high sensitive, and excellent selectivity, which provided a new insight on the potential applications of NBS-CDs to develop the biosensor in clinical diagnosis and other biologically related areas.

AB Mercury ions (Hg2+) are one of the compulsory items in the quality control of herbal medicines for its serious toxicity to human health. Highly selective and sensitive Hg2+ detection, especially in complex real samples, is still challenging. In this work, Fluorescent (FL) carbon dots (CDs) with a core-shell structures composed of the crystalline core of stacked sp2-hybridized carbon layers and the shell of functional groups on the periphery of carbon layers are facilely prepared through a one-step hydrothermal synthetic route. They can specifically interact with Hg2+ in aqueous medium to form aggregates, during which coordination of carboxyl functional groups on the surface of CDs with Hg2+ occurred, which facilitated electron transfer from the CDs to Hg2+. As a result, fluorescence of the CDs was quenched with a high efficiency, making the detection of Hg2+ highly sensitive with the limit of determination (LOD) of 2.2 nM (3s). With that, detection of Hg2+ in the complex compound herbal medicines samples with highly reproducible results has been successfully realized by using the as-prepared CDs, showing that fluorescent CDs-based probe may have great potential in the quality controls of heavy metals for pharmaceutical analysis.

AB A new type of nanoelectrode, nanoporous platinum (NPt) electrode was prepared on aluminum oxide membrane by thermal evaporation deposition. The morphology, conductivity and electrocatalytic activity of NPt electrode were characterized and compared with those of nanofilm-Pt electrode through scanning electron microscopy (SEM), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and cyclic voltammetry (CV) techniques, respectively. SEM images showed that "nanocavities" observed in NPt electrode were actually 2-dimensional enclosures by linked nanoparticles. It was different from the conventional arrays of "nanocavities" formed on homogeneous metal films. EIS data indicated that NPt electrode possesses higher conductivity. Compared with that on nanofilm-Pt electrode (14.05 Omega.cm(2)), the impedance spectrum on NPt electrode exhibits a semicircle portion with much smaller diameters (1.24 Omega.cm(2) for NPt-100, 1.48 Omega.cm(2) for NPt-200). Meanwhile, the response sensitivity of NPt electrode to O-2 is 0.85 mA cm(-2), which is larger than that of nanofilm-Pt electrode (0.54 mA cm(-2)). The largest catalytic current for nitric oxide (NO) was obtained in buffer with pH value of 9.4 while for Angeli's salt (AS) was obtained in buffer with pH value of 5.4. Additionally, electrocatalytic mechanisms of NPt electrode toward NO and AS were proposed, which indicating it depended on pH value of buffer solution. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This current review article focuses on recent contributions to on-site forensic investigations. Portable and potentially portable methods are presented and critically discussed about (bio)chemical trace analysis and studies performed outside the controlled laboratory environment to rapidly help in crime scene inquiries or forensic intelligence purposes. A wide range of approaches including electrochemical sensors, microchip electrophoresis, ambient ionization on portable mass spectrometers, handheld Raman and NIR instruments as well as and point-of-need devices, like paper-based platforms, for in-field analysis of latent evidences, controlled substances, drug screening, hazards, and others to assist in law enforcements and solving crime more efficiently are highlighted. The covered examples have successfully demonstrated the huge potential of portable devices for on-site applications. Future investigations should consider analytical validation to compete equality and even replace current gold standard methods. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB UV filters are a group of cosmetic ingredients commonly used in a wide variety of cosmetic products to protect users from UV solar radiation. They belong to different chemical families, such as benzophenones, p-aminobenzoates, salicylates, cinnamates, benzotriazoles, benzimidazoles, camphor derivatives, triazines, etc. These cosmetic ingredients are considered as emerging contaminants since they easily reach the aquatic environment, where they are accumulated causing harmful effects in the flora and fauna despite being present at the ng L-1 level. Therefore, the development of sensitive and selective analytical methods for their environmental surveillance monitoring is of high interest. In this sense, the so-called microextraction techniques play an important role in the sample preparation of environmental water samples.
   The aim of this review is to compile and discuss the published papers concerning analytical methods for the determination of organic UV filters in environmental water samples based on the use of both sorbent-based and solvent-based microextraction techniques. A special emphasis has been placed on the current trends, i.e., the use of novel (nano)materials and solvents, and the application of the most advanced approaches. The increase in the number of published articles related to the use of these miniaturized techniques reflects their high potential in the determination of organic UV filters in environmental water samples.

AB A conductometric sensor for potassium ions in solution is presented. Interdigitated, planar gold electrodes were coated with a potassium-selective polymer membrane composed of a poly(vinyl chloride) matrix with about 65 wt% of plasticiser and 2-5 wt% of a potassium-selective ionophore. The impedance of the membrane was measured, using the electrodes as a transducer, and related to the concentration of potassium in a sample solution in contact with the membrane. Sensitivity was optimised by varying the sensor components, and selectivity for potassium over sodium was also shown. The resulting devices are compact, miniature, robust sensors which, by means of impedance measurements, eliminate the need for a reference electrode. The sensor was tested for potassium concentration changes of 2 mM across the clinically relevant range of 2.7-18.7 mM. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this work, a new label-free biosensor based on highly effective decomposition of a branched DNA polymer and target-transition recycling amplification was designed for ultrasensitive electrochemical determination of lead ion (Pb2+). The branched DNA polymer formed by hybridization chain reaction (HCR) was first immobilized on electrode and served as the carrier for loading abundant silver nano-particle (AgNPs) to generate an extremely high initial current signal output. Then, the molecular triggers T-1 and T-2, which were produced through a target-transition recycling amplification, could respectively disassemble the backbone and side chain of the branched DNA polymer with remarkably decreased current for sensitive detection of Pb2+. Compared with traditional one-trigger induced disassembly strategy, the proposed approach exhibited higher decomposition efficiency. The experimental data showed that this developed biosensor had a superior performance for Pb2+ detection with a low detection limit down to 0.24 pM. Furthermore, the established strategy set up a new way to achieve the ultrasensitive detection of other metal ions. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A novel non-enzymatic glucose sensor was constructed based on the nanolayered Co(OH)(2) deposited on polymeric graphitic carbon nitride (Co(OH)(2)-g-C3N4) via chemical bath deposition. The two-dimensional nanocomposite was used to modify a carbon paste electrode and its electrochemical performance of electrode was carefully evaluated. The electrochemical oxidation of glucose at modified electrode was studied by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) in 0.2 M KOH. It revealed a remarkable electrocatalytic behavior and noticeably synergistic effect as a result of decent exfoliation of graphitic carbon nitride in the presence of Co(OH)(2). The amperometric response achieved by the modified electrode showed two calibration ranges with an excellent selectivity. A single-frequency impedance method was applied for glucose determination as an alternative to conventional EIS methods. The developed sensor represents a high sensitivity, wide concentration range (25 mu M - 420.0 mM by impedimetry and 6.6-9800 mu M by amperometry), and high reproducibility. The modified electrode showed a good selectivity for glucose over potentially interfering materials such as dopamine, ascorbic acid, urea, and uric acid. Finally, the Co(OH)(2)-g-C3N4-CPE was utilized for quantification of glucose in blood serum samples. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The comprehensive analysis of aqueous film forming foam (AFFF) formulations has led in recent years to the discovery of novel classes of perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs). Whether the pre-existing analytical methods for historically monitored PFASs, including perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), could be transferable to a large breadth of newly identified PFASs remains, however, an open question. Data from various lines of evidence indicate that current extraction procedures previously validated with anionic and neutral PFASs may seriously underperform for many cationic and zwitterionic PFASs. The extraction efficiency and instrumental response could be strongly matrix-dependent, which may preclude a robust analysis. The present study sought to investigate a suitable sample preparation procedure for the analysis of anionic, cationic, and zwitterionic PFASs in soil samples. In total, 86 PFASs, representing 24 chemical classes previously discovered in AFFF formulations or at AFFF-impacted sites, were evaluated. The merits and limitations of various extraction media were examined using an AFFF-impacted field-weathered loam soil, as well as a background loam soil amended with AFFFs in-house. Methanol with hydrochloric acid provided excellent recoveries for most cationic and zwitterionic PFASs, including fluorotelomer sulfonamidoalkyl betaines (e.g., 6:2 FTAB) and fluorotelomer betaines (e.g., 9:1:2 FTB), yet performed less satisfactorily for certain anionic PFASs, and may also cause conversion of some PFASs. Sequential extractions using methanol with ammonium acetate exhibited limited matrix effects and suitable recoveries of PFASs from soils of diverse textural classes and organic matter content. The newly-developed extraction method presented the best option for future in-depth characterization of PFASs at AFFF-impacted sites. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Kinetic optimization of continuous liquid-liquid extraction (CLLE) can shorten sample preparation times and reduce losses of labile or volatile analytes. Here, we coupled a downscaled CLLE apparatus with atmospheric pressure chemical ionization interface of triple quadrupole mass spectrometer. Real-time sampling was guided by an Arduino-based programmable logic controller. The recorded datasets were processed to compute the extraction rate constants for the target analytes. The extraction time in subsequent on-line experiments was set to 180 min as a compromise between the reduction of the analysis time and maximizing its yield. Interestingly, off-line analysis of the extract produced different results than on-line analysis pointing to the immanent degradation of the collected extract aliquots. Next, we implemented this hyphenated system in the analysis of red wine samples, which were stored during different periods of time after opening the bottle. The results reveal differences in the depletion of the volatile wine components during storage. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Volatile fatty acids (VFAs) are among the most important parameters in process monitoring of anaerobic digestion plants for biogas production. The concentration of single VFA species is typically determined by direct injection of the acidified aqueous phase of digestate samples into GC-FID. Analysis of dimethyl carbonate extracts was investigated as an alternative method consisting of a simple and rapid in-vial procedure of acidification and solvent extraction of the sample, followed by centrifugation and GC-MS analysis. The principal figures of merit resulting from internal standard calibration were comparable to those proposed for the direct analysis of aqueous digestate, while the analysis of real samples did not provide statistically significant differences between the two methods according to parametric and non-parametric tests. Procedural aspects including sample amount and solid removal improved with dimethyl carbonate, while GC contamination was reduced. The method was applied to seventeen samples from fully operating anaerobic digesters fed with various feedstocks and enabled the individuation of high probability of system stress through the values of total VFA, propanoic acid, longer chained VFA concentrations and the ratio between acetic and propanoic acid concentrations. The use of dimethyl carbonate allowed the detection of alicyclic and aromatic acids that could represent new molecular markers in assessing the origin of feed and process conditions.

AB Infrared laser ablation microsampling was used with data-dependent acquisition (DDA) and ion mobility-enhanced data-independent acquisition (HDMSE) for mass spectrometry based bottom-up proteomics analysis of rat brain tissue. Results from HDMSE and DDA analyses of the 12 laser ablation sampled tissue sections showed that HDMSE consistently identified approximately seven times more peptides and four times more proteins than DDA. To evaluate the impact of ultra-performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) peak congestion on HDMSE and DDA analysis, whole tissue digests from rat brain were analyzed at six different UPLC separation times. Analogous to results from laser ablated samples, HDMSE analyses of whole tissue digests yielded about four times more proteins identified than DDA for all six UPLC separation times.

AB 5-Methyl-2'-deoxycytidine (5-mdC), 5-hydroxymethyl-2'-deoxycytidine (5-hmdC), 5-methylcytidine (5-mrC) and 5-hydroxymethylcytidine (5-hmrC) are epigenetic marks of DNA and RNA, and aberrant levels of these modified nucleosides were found to be associated with various cancers. Urine is a preferred source of biological fluid for biomarker discovery because the sample collection process is not invasive to patients. Herein, we developed a novel malic acid-enhanced hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (HILIC-MS/MS) method for sensitive and simultaneous quantification of the modified cytosine nucleosides in human urine. Malic acid markedly increased the detection sensitivities of all four cytosine nucleosides, with the limits of detection (LODs) for 5-mdC, 5-hmdC, 5-mrC and 5-hmrC being 0.025, 0.025, 0.025 and 0.050 fmol, respectively. By using this method, we demonstrated, for the first time, the presence of 5-hmrC in human urine, and we successfully quantified 5-mdC, 5-hmdC, 5-mrC and 5-hmrC in urine samples collected from 90 patients with colorectal cancer (CRC) and 90 healthy controls. We found that the levels of 5-mdC, 5-hmdC, 5-mrC and 5-hmrC in urine were all substantially decreased in CRC patients, suggesting that these modified nucleosides might have great potential to be noninvasive biomarkers for early detection and prognosis of CRC. Together, we established a novel and sensitive method for detecting 5-methylated and 5-hydroxymethylated cytosine nucleosides in human urine and the results from this study may stimulate future investigations about the regulatory roles of these cytosine derivatives in the initiation and development of CRC.

AB The detection of pyrophosphate (PPi) in living systems has attracted considerable attention in recent years due to its biological significance. While many fluorescent PPi sensors were developed with emission changes in the visible region, near-infrared (NIR) fluorescent sensors for PPi are rather scarce. In this paper, a dicyanomethylene-benzopyran (DCMB) based phenol-bridged dinuclear Zn(II)-DPA (DPA: dipicolylamine) complex was prepared, which was found to be a promising NIR fluorescent sensor for PPi. This sensor features a remarkable large Stokes shift (>150 nm) and shows colorimetric and NIR fluorescence changes for PPi with high selectivity and sensitivity in 100% aqueous solution. The detection limit of this sensor for PPi was determined to be as low as 42 nM. In addition, this sensor exhibits low cytotoxicity and can be conveniently employed for bioimaging PPi in living cells and animals, indicating it has great potential for in vitro and in vivo detection of PPi.

AB In this work, a paper-based optoelectronic sensor (paper-nose) is presented for sensing volatile gases in air. The proposed optoelectronic sensor is a combination of both colorimetric (optical) and chemiresistive (electronic) sensor arrays in order to improve the selectivity of the paper-nose in the complex air background. The optical sensors are based on chemoresponsive dyes, namely Reichardt's dye (2,6-diphenyl-4-(2,4,6-triphenyl-1-pyridinio)phenolate), bromocresol purple, methyl red, bromothymol blue, brilliant yellow and manganese tetraphenylporphyrin (Mn-TPP). The chemiresistive sensors are based on nanomaterials, such as carbon nanotubes (CNT), PEDOT:PSS, graphite, and an ionic liquid, 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide (EMI TESL). Sensor is fabricated through direct handwriting of sensing materials using a pen on paper without the need of expensive cleanroom facilities. The optoelectronic sensor is tested in ambient air with different volatile gases such as methanol, ammonia, toluene, acetone and ethanol and their mixtures of varying concentrations. The detected electrical and optical responses together form a unique signature for each volatile gas and its mixture. Support-vector machine (SVM) is applied for target classification and detection. From the SVM result, it is found that better discriminative power is achieved by combining optical and electrical responses. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The envisaged ubiquitous sensing and biosensing for varied applications has motivated materials development toward low cost, biocompatible platforms. In this paper, we demonstrate that carbon nanodiamonds (NDs) can be combined with potato starch (PS) and be deposited on a glassy carbon electrode (GCE) in the form of a homogeneous, rough film, with electroanalytical performance tuned by varying the relative ND-PS concentration. As a proof of concept, the ND/PS film served as matrix to immobilize tyrosinase (Tyr) and the resulting Tyr-ND-PS/GCE biosensor was suitable to detect catechol using differential pulse voltammetry with detection limit of 3.9 x 10(-7) mol L-1 in the range between 5.0 x 10(-6) and 7.4 x 10(-4) mol L-1. Catechol could also be detected in river and tap water samples. This high sensitivity, competitive with biosensors made with more sophisticated procedures and materials in the literature, is attributed to the large surface area and conductivity imparted by the small NDs (<5 nm). In addition, the ND-PS matrix may have its use extended to immobilize other enzymes and biomolecules, thus representing a potential biocompatible platform for ubiquitous biosensing.

AB In our study, the carbon nanodots (CDs) were synthesized by one-step solvothermal method using resorcinol as the only presusor. The obtained CDs contained abundant unsaturated oxygen-containing groups resulting from the surface oxidation. A novel, simple, and real-time fluorescent assay for the detection of water in various organic solvents was thus established by reducing the surface oxidation states. Excellent reversibility can be readily achieved by the external stimulus water and N,N'-dicyclo-hexylcarbodiimide (DCC).

AB Aminoglycoside antibiotics (AAs) abused in animal husbandry can cause antibiotic residues in animal derived foods, which do harm to human beings' health. Therefore the detection of AAs residues in the animal-origin foods, such as milk, eggs and meat is necessary. We used two single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) oligonucleotides as nonspecific receptors to develop a simple colorimetric sensor array based on gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) for identification and quantification the AAs. Different AA addition triggered the DNA detaching from AuNPs then resulted in different degree salt induced aggregation of AuNPs. The aggregation induced spectral changes of AuNPs with five AA addition were analyzed based on pattern recognition techniques, fisher linear discriminant analysis (FLD) and hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA). The results indicated that colorimetric sensor array has successfully identified five AAs at a concentration range of 120-280 nM. Five AAs in aqueous solution and complex milk matrix can be identified with an accuracy of 100%. More importantly, our developed sensor array is sufficiently sensitive for the discrimination of pure streptomycin (STR), binary mixtures of STR and gentamicin (GEN) at a total concentration of 120 nM.

AB An ultrasensitive lateral-flow assay is developed for rapid quantitative detection of small molecules on site. The conceptual novelty, which transfers lateral-flow assays to the category of highly sensitive quantitative systems, is due to employment of a bifunctional ligand combined with volumetric registration of magnetic nanolabels. The ligand provides extremely high affinity for trapping the nanolabels and, simultaneously, efficiently competes with the analyzed molecules for the limited quantity of antigen-binding sites on the nanolabels. The developed assay has been demonstrated as the first express method for measuring in human serum of free thyroxine (fT4). The limit of detection is 20 fM or 16 fg/ml at the assay time <30 min with the dynamic range of 3 orders. Besides, we present the results of first characterization of kinetic parameters of interaction between free thyroxine and monoclonal antibody, as well as of competitive relationship between fT4 and fT4-biotin. The proposed universal platform can be used for ultrasensitive detection of small molecules in human in vitro diagnostics, veterinary, biosafety and counter-terrorism, food quality control, environmental monitoring, etc., as well as for search of new, previously undetectable, diagnostic markers in medicine.

AB Using trimethyl lock as a useful mean, a selective and sensitive fluorescent probe was developed for the detection of biothiols with an emission in near infrared spectral region (694 nm) and a large Stokes shift (129 nm). The inserted trimethyl lock between the fluorophore and the sensing group, 2, 4-dinitrobenzensulfonate, highly improved the response rate of this probe toward GSH because the unfavorable steric interactions between three methyl groups resulted in an extremely rapid intramolecular lactonization reaction to form a hydrocoumarin. This probe displayed an instantaneous response (within seconds) to GSH at a very low concentration in aqueous medium and the detection limit was as low as 2.5 nM based on S/N = 3. The fluorescence intensity of the solution of probe 1 at 694 nm displayed a good linearity (R = 0.9917) with the concentration of GSH in a range of 0.0-5.0 mu M. Importantly, this probe exhibited a good performance in detecting biothiols in serum samples, living cells and organism. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Caffeine is a common pharmaceutical and personal care product pollutant in wastewater. This work offers rapid and single-step detection of caffeine in an aquatic matrix based on high performance surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS). Novel chemical SERS nanosensors were developed employing molecularly-imprinted polymer (MIP) particles loaded with Ag nanoparticles (AgNPs) using precipitation polymerization to form AgNPs@MIP nanocomposites. Theophylline was applied as a dummy template molecule in the synthesis process due to its high structural similarity with caffeine and greater availability. The nanocomposite was characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy(FTIR), X-ray diffraction(XRD), and ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) spectroscopy. Static and kinetic adsorption testing demonstrated the specific affinity of AgNPs@MIP nanocomposites for caffeine and a rapid adsorption equilibration rate. Moreover, a simple solid phase extraction cartridge comprising AgNPs@MIP nanocomposites as adsorbents (AgNPs@MISPE), a syringe, and a removable microporous membrane were employed to detect the SERS signal of caffeine. The AgNPs@MISPE was used to detect caffeine with excellent uniformity (relative standard deviation, RSD = 4.8%) and good repeatability (RSD = 8.7%). The separation and detection processes were integrated into a single step, and the overall analysis time was 23 min. The detection limit was 100 ng L-1, which is less than the caffeine content reported in many rivers. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed chemical nanosensors are a low-cost and reliable tool for the rapid screening of caffeine in wastewater or other aquatic matrices.

AB A fast and simple utra-high performance supercritical fluid chromatography (UHPSFC) method has been developed for the determination of nine sunscreens (UV filters), namely 2-ethylhexyl-2-hydroxybenzoate (ES), ethylhexyl-methoxycinnamate (EMC), benzophenone-3 (BZ3), octocrylene (OCR), bis-ethylhexyloxyphenol-methoxyphenyl triazine (EMT), butyl-methoxydibenzoyl-methane (BDM), diethylamino-hydroxybenzoyl-hexyl-benzoate (DHB), ethylhexyl-triazone (ET), and diethylhexyl-butamido-triazone (DBT) in cosmetic samples. The separation was achieved with Acquity UPC2 Torus 2-PIC (100 x 3.0 mm, 1.7 mu m) column. The influence of key chromatographic parameters on resolution was evaluated. The optimal mobile phase was a gradient mixture of carbon dioxide and methanol containing ammonium acetate, at flow rate 1.2 mL min(-1). The back-pressure of the system was set to 150 bar and the temperature to 40 degrees C. The compounds were determined with diode-array detection at 280 nm, 305 nm and 340 nm depending on absorbance maxima. The proposed UHPSFC method provided separation of the nine target sunscreens within 2.5 min without labor-consuming sample pretreatment procedure. The method was validated according to the concept of the total error and the accuracy profile. The inter-laboratory reproducibility was evaluated between two independent laboratories (in France and Czech Republic). The reliability of the developed method was shown by application to commercial sunscreen-containing cosmetic sample obtained from French market. The measured limits of quantification showed the suitability of the proposed method for determination of UV filters considering the European Union requirements. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB In this study, a new miniaturized and integrated analytical system was developed based on the in-line coupling of boronate affinity solid phase extraction with capillary isoelectric focusing separation and UV detection. This original coupling takes advantage of the selective enrichment of cis-diol-containing compounds using a boronate affinity sorbent and the exceptional focusing features of isoelectric focusing process. Such coupling has been used for preconcentration/purification and separation of urinary cate-cholamines (dopamine, adrenaline and noradrenaline) as proof of concept. Poly(glycidyl methacrylate-co-ethylene dimethacrylate) monolithic capillary column (8 cm) was chosen as solid phase extraction support due to its good chemical stability and its easy and versatile surface functionalization. Characterization of the miniaturized boronate affinity monolith column (mu BAMC) was done by frontal affinity chromatography. An active-site amount of about 0.16 nmol cm(-1) (75 mu m i. d.) of phenyl boronic acid groups and K-d values ranging from 224 to 106 mu M were obtained for catechol and catecholamines. A high loading volume (up to 15 times the affinity column volume) can be introduced with quantitative recovery yields. Optimization of the in-line coupling concerned the adaptation of (i) the mu BAMC volume, (i.e. length and inner diameter of the monolithic column) for loading of large sample volumes and (ii) the CIEF experimental conditions. The ampholyte mixture was adapted (i.e. nature and concentration of carrier ampholytes, volume of sacrificial electrolytes) in order to ensure elution and separation of catecholamines and to decrease limit of detection down to 10-20 ng ml(-1). The optimized method was applied to analyze urine samples. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this study, magnetic framework composites (MFCs) (Fe3O4@TMU-10) microspheres were successfully fabricated and applied as an effective sorbent for preconcentration of the two model tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) amitriptyline and imipramine from biological samples. MFCs were fabricated by a step-by-step assembly, novel, simple and efficient strategy. The shell thickness of the Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) could also be easily controlled by tuning the number of assembly cycles. By coupling magnetic solid-phase extraction (MSPE) with high-performance liquid chromatography with UV detector (HPLC-UV), a simple, reliable, fast, sensitive and cost-effective method for simultaneous determination of TCAs was developed. Under optimal conditions, the preconcentration factors and relative recoveries of the studied compounds were obtained in the range of 43-50 and 90.5-99.0% respectively. The calibration curves were obtained in the range of 5-800 mu g L-1 with reasonable linearity (R-2 > 0.9904) and the limits of detection (LODs) ranged between 2 and 4 mu g L-1 (based on S/N = 3). The relative standard deviations of intra- and inter-day tests ranged from 3.1 to 4.6% and from 4.3 to 5.2%, respectively. The results demonstrate that Fe3O4@TMU-10 core-shell magnetic microspheres combine advantages of MOFs and magnetic nanoparticles, and are the promising sorbents for rapid and efficient extraction of target analytes from urine and plasma complex biological samples.

AB Only few reports describe the use of capillary electrophoresis in the context of Fragment Based Drug Discovery (FBDD). In this paper, we will present a generic, fully automated, microscale electrophoretic mobility shift displacement assay that can be used in FBDD for primary screening of weak biomolecular interactions between fragments and target protein. The accuracy and reliability of the present method was demonstrated by measuring the IC50 value of two known fragments inhibiting thrombin, namely benzamidine and p-aminobenzamidine and a relatively weak inhibitor, nafamostat. Furthermore, we built a small chemical library to evaluate the performance and the advantage of our newly developed screening-bioassay compared to the direct affinity capillary electrophoresis-binding assay. The results demonstrate the high discriminatory power of the method and above all its ability to screen neutral, negatively or positively charged molecules, as well as molecules that have no or low UV-VIS absorbance, greatly expanding the scope of the assay. Finally, we proved that this approach is able to discriminate between reversible and irreversible binders. Altogether, this work demonstrates that capillary electrophoresis could constitute an important added value in the arsenal used to screen fragments in drug discovery. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB This review encompasses the mechanisms of electrochemical glucose detection and recent advances in non-enzymatic glucose sensors based on a variety of materials ranging from platinum, gold, metal alloys/adatom, non-precious transition metal/metal oxides to glucose-specific organic materials. It shows that the discovery of new materials based on unique nanostructures have not only provided the detailed insight into non-enzymatic glucose oxidation, but also demonstrated the possibility of direct detection in whole blood or interstitial fluids. We critically evaluate various aspects of non-enzymatic electrochemical glucose sensors in terms of significance as well as performance. Beyond laboratory tests, the prospect of commercialization of non-enzymatic glucose sensors is discussed. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Capillary tubes are widely used in micro-devices because of their tubular structure, high efficiency, small dead volume and good flexibility. In micro-devices, such as miniaturized chromatography and solid phase microextraction, capillary tubes play a crucial role as stationary phases, carriers or adsorbents for complex sample analysis. Many strategies have been proposed to improve their performance and extend their application by surface engineering. One of the most promising strategies is mussel-inspired chemistry, polydopamine surface modification, which has become a powerful tool in capillary fabrication and modification, as it provides a versatile platform for the construction of diverse hybrid materials with specific functionalities. This review focuses on recent advances in the fabrication of polydopamine-coated capillary tubes for microextraction and miniaturized chromatography systems. In the first part, the preparation strategies of polydopamine coatings are discussed in detail. Next, the application of polydopamine as a novel capillary coating are described. Finally, a conclusion and the key issues that exist in this emerging field are given. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This work presents potential applications of low-cost fused deposition modeling 3D-printers to fabricate multiuse 3D-printed electrochemical cells for flow or batch measurements as well as the 3D-printing of electrochemical sensing platforms. Electrochemical cells and sensors were printed with acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) and conductive graphene-doped polylactic acid (G-PLA) filaments, respectively. The overall printing operation time and estimated cost per cell were 6 h and $ 6.00, respectively, while the sensors were printed within minutes (16 sensor strips of 1 x 2 cm in 10 min at a cost of $ 1.00 each sensor). The cell performance is demonstrated for the amperometric detection of tert-butylhydroquinone, dipyrone, dopamine and diclofenac by flow-injection analysis (FIA) and batch-injection analysis (BIA) using different working electrodes, including the proposed 3D-printed sensor, which presented comparable electroanalytical performance with other carbon-based electrodes (LOD of 0.1 mu mol L-1 for dopamine). Raman spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy of the 3D-printed sensor indicated the presence of graphene nanoribbons within the polymeric matrix. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and heterogeneous electron transfer constants (k(0)) for the redox probe Ru(NH3)(6)(+3) revealed that a glassy-carbon electrode presented faster electron transfer rates than the 3D-printed sensor; however, the latter presented lower LOD values for dopamine and catechol probably due to oxygenated functional groups at the G-PLA surface.

AB Electrochemical enantiorecognition has attracted much interest due to its advantages of low cost and simple equipment. In this work, a new chiral ionic liquid is prepared and applied as an electrolyte for the one-step synthesis of functional graphene sheets (GO-(S,S)-CIL). More importantly, an electrode is modified by the material for the construction of an electrochemical sensor (GO-(S,S)-CIL-GCE). Enantiomers including L/D-tryptophan, (R)-/(S)-mandelic acid, (R)-/(S)-malic acid, and L/D-tyrosine are successfully distinguished by GO-(S, S)-CIL-GCE in the response of peak currents to different forms. In addition, the peak potential of the L form is located negatively compared to the D form for tryptophan, and the value of the peak-to-peak potential separation approaches 72 mV. The recognition mechanism is assessed by the density functional theory calculation in detail. In brief, the present method offers great promise for the preparation of functional graphene sheets and their further application in chiral recognition. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The concentration of free chlorine used for sterilizing drinking water, recreational water, and food processing water is critical for monitoring potential environmental and human health risks, and should be strictly controlled. Here, we report a highly efficient solution-gated graphene transistor (SGGT) device, for the detection of free chlorine in a real-time and convenient manner with excellent selectivity and high sensitivity. The detection mechanism of the SGGT with Au gate electrode is attributed to two combined effects: the reduction of the free chlorine on Au gate electrode; and the direct oxidization of graphene by the free chlorine in solution. The SGGT device shows a linear response range of free chlorine from 1 mu M to 100 mu M, with detection limit as low as 100 nM, far beyond the sensitivity required for practical applications. Finally, we also demonstrate the performance of the SGGT for determination of free chlorine in local tap water samples. The results presented herein have important implications in the development of portable and disposable devices based on SGGT sensing platform for the simple, real-time, and selective determination of free chlorine.

AB A novel UV light emitting diode induced fluorescence detector (LED-IF) with HPLC flow cell was designed and evaluated for determination of aflatoxins. Ray tracing method was employed to optimize the design of the optical components (such as reshaping thin lens for light source and fluorescence collection), and optical structure, and the geometry of flow cell. An ordinary UV LED with wavelength of 370 nm and radiant power of 5 mW was used as excitation light source. A photoelectric amplifier AccuOpt2000 with light sensitivity of 10(-5) similar to 10(-4) lx was utilized for fluorescence detection, instead of a photo multiplier tube (PMT). The lowest detection limit (LOD) of the LED-IF was 0.077 ppb for aflatoxin B-1 by HPLC method without derivatization. The LED-IF was then coupled with a homemade iodine derivatization device, which was connected to the HPLC column outlet for determination of aflatoxins in edible oil and peanut samples. It was found that the edible oil sample contained aflatoxin B-1 and B-2 at average level of 7.14 (n = 3) and 0.30 ng/g (n = 3), respectively; while the peanut sample contained aflatoxin B-1 and B-2 at average level of 9.22 (n = 3) and 1.36 ng/g (n = 3), respectively. The overall power consumption of the LED-IF was 1 W/12 V. The sensitivity of the LED-IF was similar to commercial fluorescence detectors, which utilized a pulse Xe lamp as excitation light source and a PMT for detection, with power consumption of 150 W.

AB Rapid structural identification of natural compounds in the crude extract of traditional Chinese medicine by conventional liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry is complex and challenging. In particular, it is difficult to distinguish and identify structural isomers. In this work, we proposed a novel strategy that combines a typical ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography-multidimensional mass spectrometry approach and the post-processing UNIFI scientific information system to rapidly identify lanostane analogs and isomers in Poria cocos. First, this strategy requires setting up a high-resolution key MS database and an in-house compound library. Then, ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography coupled with high-resolution tandem data-independent mass spectrometry and ion mobility mass spectrometry was used to acquire untargeted multidimensional mass spectral data. Finally, a new and reliable multidimensional MS analytical workflow was developed to targeted filter the acquired data based on an in-house compound library via the UNIFI (TM) software. As result, a total of 121 lanostane-type triterpene acids were identified by high-resolution molecular mass, fragment ions, and collision cross-section values. Eight triterpene acids were unambiguously identified by comparing the retention time and MS/MS data with those of reference compounds. Three compounds were detected and reported for the first time based on their neutral losses, characteristic ions, and fragmentation pathways compared with those of known compounds. We anticipate that such an analytical approach can be extended to rapidly screen and characterize other herbal medicine compounds with multiple isomers. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In recent years, metabolomics has surfaced as an innovative research strategy in human metabolism, whereby selection of the biological matrix and its inherent metabolome is of crucial importance. However, focusing on a single matrix may imply that relevant molecules of complementary physiological pathways, covered by other matrices, are missed. To address this problem, this study presents a unique multi-matrix platform for polar metabolic fingerprinting of feces, plasma and urine, applying ultra-high performance liquid-chromatography coupled to hybrid quadrupole-Orbitrap high-resolution mass spectrometry, that is able to achieve a significantly higher coverage of the system's metabolome and reveal more significant results and interesting correlations in comparison with single-matrix analyses. All three fingerprinting approaches were proven 'fit-for-purpose' through extensive validation in which a number of endogenous metabolites were measured in representative quality control samples. For targeted and untargeted validation of all three matrices, excellent linearity (coefficients of determination R-2>0.99 or 0.90 respectively), recovery and precision (coefficients of variance <15% or 30% respectively) were observed. The potential of the platform was demonstrated by subjecting fecal, urine and plasma samples (collected within one day) from ten healthy volunteers to metabolic fingerprinting, yielding respectively 9 672, 9 647, and 6122 components. Orthogonal partial least-squares discriminant analysis provided similar results for feces and plasma to discriminate according to gender (p-value, R-2(X), R-2(Y) and Q(2)(Y)), suggesting feces as an excellent alternative biofluid to plasma. Moreover, combining the different matrices improved the model's predictivity, indicating the superiority of multi-matrix platforms for research purposes in biomarker detection or pathway elucidation and in the selection of the most optimal matrix for future clinical purposes.

AB Carbon dots (CDs) are promising nanomaterials for biosensing, bioimaging, and drug delivery due to their large surface area, excellent optical properties, and thermal and chemical stability. However, biosafety of CDs is still understudied, and there is not a generally accepted standard to evaluate the toxicity of CDs. We present a gradient network generator microfluidic device for dose-dependent testing of toxicity of CDs to a unicellular eukaryotic model organism, yeast Pichia pastoris. We fully characterized the microfluidic model and compare its performance with a conventional method. The gradient generator increased the contact area between the mixing species and enabled a high-throughput testing of CDs in a wide range of concentrations in cell chambers. Real time monitoring of yeast cell proliferation in the presence of CDs showed dose-dependent growth inhibition and various budding cell shape profiles. Comparing the result of microfluidic platform and conventional method revealed statistically significant differences in the proliferation rate of the cells between the two platforms. To understand the toxicity mechanism, we studied binding of CDs to P. pastoris and found increasing interactions of CDs with the cell surface at CDs larger concentrations. This study demonstrated the utility of the gradient generator microfluidic device as a convenient tool for toxicity assessment of nanomaterials at a cellular level. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB Distillation is widely used in industrial processes and laboratories for sample pre-treatment. The conventional apparatus of flash distillation is composed of heating source, distilling flask, condenser, and receiving flask. As disadvantages, this method shows manual and laborious analyses with high consumption of chemicals. In this paper, all these limitations were addressed by developing a fully integrated microscale distiller in agreement with the apparatus of conventional flash distillation. The main challenge facing the distillation miniaturization is the phase separation since surface forces take over from the gravity in microscale channels. Otherwise, our chip had ability to perform gravity-assisted distillations because of the somewhat large dimensions of the distillation chamber (roughly 900 mu L) that was obtained by 3D-printing. The functional distillation units were integrated into a single device composed of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS). Its fabrication was cost-effective and simple by avoiding the use of cleanroom and bonding step. In addition to user-friendly analysis and low consumption of chemicals, the method requires cost-effective instrumentation, namely, voltage supply and analytical balance. Furthermore, the so called distillation-on-a-chip (DOC) eliminates the use of membranes and electrodes (usually employed in microfluidic desalinations reported in the literature), thus avoiding drawbacks such as liquid leakage, membrane fouling, and electrode passivation. The DOC promoted desalinations at harsh salinity (NaCl 600.0 mmol L-1) with high throughput and salt removal efficiency (roughly 99%). Besides, the method was used for determination of ethanol in alcoholic beverages to show the potential of the approach toward quantitative purposes. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A sensing platform based on the attenuated total reflection surface enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy (ATR-SEIRAS) technique and immobilized aptamer has been proposed herein for the selective detection of mercury ions (Hg2+). In the proposed platform, 5'-thiolated 32-mer DNA probes with methylene blue at the 3 end were immobilized on a thin gold (Au) surface layer. Following Hg2+ ions interacting with T bases of the aptamer, T-Hg-T bonds are formed; resulting in a hairpin-shaped formation of the DNA and a detectable change in the IR absorbance of the sensing interface. Notably, the background noise produced by external molecules (e.g., water, non-specific binding molecules and bulk solution) is reduced to a negligible level by means of the ATR detection mode. It is shown that the proposed sensor has a linear response (R-2 = 0.986) with high sensitivity and good selectivity over the Hg2+ range of 0.01 mu M-50 mu M. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB Identification of specific and reliable biomarkers or unique characteristics is significant for cancer molecular diagnosis and cancer therapeutic assessment. As a biomarker, sialic acid expression in human biofluid or on cell surface is one of interest to determine the tumor malignancy and metastasis since it involves in many crucial metabolic processes. In this work, we aimed to develop a molecular diagnosis method to make it possible to distinguish human breast cancer and normal tissues by capturing rich spectral features of phenyboronic acid-based nanoprobe (MPBA@AgNP) when it binds to sialic acid on cell surface. We analyzed and found that the marker bands at 1074 and 1570 cm(-1) recorded by Surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) displayed discernible spectral differences in vitro cell lines. Density functional theory (DFT) was further used to explore and support the detailed changes of vibrational modes affected by sialic acid. This method is generally applicable by testing three types of in vitro cell lines (HepG2, Hela, BNL.CL2) and one pair of the tissue sections (cancer tissue and normal tissue) from the human breast regions. Besides, the area under receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves for 1074 and 1572 cm(-1) are 0.9419 and 0.9023, confirming determination of the specific molecular expression by the spectral features holds potential promise for improving cancer detection accuracy. Furthermore, sialic acid expression and distribution acquired of breast tissues by confocal SERS mapping further indicated our method is possible for cancer early diagnosis and toward to real-time in vivo study.

AB Contamination of mycotoxins has been a general problem of food safety and afflicts people all around the world. Ochratoxin A (OTA), an abundant and representative food-contaminating mycotoxin, has a detrimental effect on our health. Herein, an ultrasensitive surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) aptasensor was fabricated for OTA detection. Au-(core)@ Au-Ag-(shell) nanogapped nanostructures (Au@ Au-Ag NNSs) were coupled with Fe3O4 magnetic nanoparticles (Fe3O4 MNPs) by OTA aptamer and its complementary DNA sequence. The distance between two nanoparticles become far away in presence of the OTA due to the affinity of aptamer. This effect can obviously bring about the change of Raman intensity which can be used for the detection of OTA. Compared with pure metal nanoparticles, Au@ Au-Ag NNSs can effectively enhance the Raman intensity of Raman signal molecule (4-MBA) via the ultrasmall nanogap, which contribute to the sensitivity of the sensor system. Additionally, the utilization of Fe3O4 MNPs offers a green, economical and facile technology to capture targets from solution. The specially modified aptamer and its complementary strand establish a bridge connecting between Au@ Au-Ag NNSs and Fe3O4 MNPs. In this study, OTA concentration with a linear range of 0.01-50 ng mL(-1) and the limit of detection (LOD) was as low as 0.004 ng mL(-1). The proposed SERS aptasensor can combine both of these above type of materials and provide a rapid, sensitive, and low-cost methodology for numerous future applications of point-of-care diagnostics.

When B1 was added to FA in CH3CH2OH/HEPES (10 mM, pH = 7.4, 1:99, v/v) solution, the solution system strongly enhanced the fluorescence. Over various small molecular species, probe B1 showed high sensitivity and selectivity for detecting FA, with a low limit of detection (0.107 mu M). Furthermore, probe B1 was successfully applied for visualizing FA in human embryonic kidney (HEK293T) cells, demonstrating its value of application in living biomedical samples.

AB An ultrasensitive electrochemical aptasensor for kanamycin (KAN) detection was constructed with a dual-signal amplification strategy. The aptasensor achieved greatly amplified sensitivity due to the excellent electrical conductivity of the ordered mesoporous carbon-chitosan (OMC-CS)/gold nanoparticles-streptavidin (AuNPs-SA) and DNA2 labelled with ferrocene (Fc-DNA2). The AuNPs-SA was used to immobilize the DNA strand (biotin labelled) with the biotin-streptavidin system. The DNA2 strand containing the KAN aptamer was labelled with ferrocene to increase the current signal on the electrode surface when bound to KAN. Some factors that affect the performance of the aptasensor were optimized, and the proposed aptasensor provided a wide linear range from 1 x 10 M-10 to 4 x 10 (6) M, with a detection limit as low as 35.69 pM for KAN under the optimized conditions. This aptasensor had satisfactory electrochemical performance with good stability, sensitivity and reproducibility. Additionally, it also displayed a good specificity for KAN without interference from competitive analogues. Furthermore, the constructed aptasensor was successfully used to detect KAN in a real milk sample. The proposed method for KAN detection has great potential for the detection of other antibiotics.

AB Ratiometric fluorescent probes with a self-immolative spacer for beta-galactosidase (beta-gal) were developed. They function by beta-gal-cleaving the beta-galactoside bond of fluorescent substrates, followed by self-immolation to liberate the amino group of fluorophore. Thus, a remarkable variation in the photo-physical properties was observed and the corresponding ratiometric detection of beta-gal was realized. Our studies demonstrated that the GNPN exhibited high sensitivity for recognition of beta-gal, with a detection limit as low as 0.17 U L-1. GNPN can rapidly quantify beta-gal enzyme activity; the emission ratio F-545/F-475 for the GNPN reached maxima after approximately 4 min, which was one of the shortest response time ever reported. Furthermore, we demonstrated that these probes possess excellent biocompatibility and can be used to visualize the endogenous beta-gal in ovarian cancer cells. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB The hybridization of two complementary RNAs in single cells depends on their complementary sequences and secondary structures, and is usual inefficient at the low concentrations. The bacterial RNA chaperone Hfq increases the rate of base pairing hybridization of mRNA, and stabilizes sRNA-mRNA duplexes. However, The RNA chaperone Hfq accelerates the RNA annealing between two complementary pair RNAs with a still unknown mechanism. So the sensitivity assay of Hfq induced RNA annealing is very important. By using a 2-OMe-RNA modified molecular beacon as a reporter, which can be specificity cleavage by DSN, we observed the amplification reaction kinetics (k(rea)) is 0.16 s(-1). Our results showed that the Hfq hexamer directly induced the RNA annealing, and DSN aided the ultra-sensitivity assay reaction with 0.18 fM Hfq/RNA1/MB1. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The synthesis of biomacromolecule imprinted materials is a challenge with the bulkiness and instability of macromolecule, such as protein. A green strategy to prepare hydrophilic protein-imprinted resin (HPIR) was firstly developed using resorcinol and melamine as double functional monomers, hexamethylenetetramine instead of formaldehyde as crosslinker, water as solvent, and bovine serum albumin (BSA) as a dual-function template. BSA as dual-function template could not only act as template but also porogen in the preparation of HPIR. According to the adsorption experiments, the adsorption kinetics of BSA on HPIR obeyed pseudo-second-order adsorption kinetics and the equilibrium data were best described by Langmuir isotherm model. The adsorption capability was 44.3459 mg g(-1) (25 degrees C), and the imprinted factor for binding BSA is 5.78. HPIR showed high adsorption capacity, fast mass transfer rate, and specific selectivity towards BSA in aqueous solvent. More importantly, HPIR can be applied to selectively adsorb target protein BSA in urine without the matrix interference of biological matrix, therefore, it is promising for HPIR to be applied to proteomics, diagnostics, and pharmaceutics.

AB A novel pressure-assisted dual-headspace lab-in-syringe microextraction technique is presented as an alternative approach for automatic on-line membraneless gas separation of volatile compounds. The developed gas-liquid microextraction procedure is based on the lab-in-syringe (LIS) concept by using two independent micro-syringe pumps which are connected to each other for the application of negative and positive pressure inside the common headspace area of the syringe barrels. The adoption of reduced and increased pressure conditions is facilitated by the programmable LIS strategy resulting in increased extraction rates. The analytical process includes the in-situ ammonia vapor generation in the headspace of the first microsyringe, under reduced pressure environment, and its subsequent transportation into the headspace of the second microsyringe. Then, positive pressure is applied inside the second microsyringe enabling the ammonia vapor dissolution into the extraction solution to produce a fluorescent product (isoindol-1-sulfonat). The reaction is time and temperature affected, thus after an optimized time of delay inside the thermostated syringe barrel at 60 degrees C, it is delivered into the flow-cell of the miniSIA system where it is quantified at 425 nm (excitation wavelength, 365 nm). The proposed preconcentration system has been fully tested and optimized regarding the relevant parameters affecting the generation of gaseous ammonia, its effective transportation into the headspace of the second syringe barrel and its quantitative dissolution and reaction with the extraction solution. For a sample volume of 3000 mu L, the sample frequency is 8 h(-1), the precision expressed as relative standard deviation (RSD) is 3.6 (at 5.0 mg L-1) and a detection limit (3s) of 0.05 mu g L-1 for ammonium is obtained. The detection is linear in the concentration range of 0.15 and 10.0 mu g L-1 with a correlation coefficient of 0.9987. The accuracy of the proposed method has been evaluated by analyzing a standard reference material (relative error: 3.8%) as well as using the Certified Method (relative error < 5.5%) for ammonium determination. The potential of this novel schema has been demonstrated for ammonia determination in natural water samples. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A method was developed to detect and quantify organophosphate nerve agent (OPNA) metabolites in dried blood samples. Dried blood spots (DBS) and microsampling devices are alternatives to traditional blood draws, allowing for safe handling, extended stability, reduced shipping costs, and potential self-sampling. DBS and microsamplers were evaluated for precision, accuracy, sensitivity, matrix effects, and extraction recovery following collection of whole blood containing five OPNA metabolites. The metabolites of VX, Sarin (GB), Soman (GD), Cyclosarin (GF), and Russian VX (VR) were quantitated from 5.0 to 500 ngmL(-1) with precision of <= 16% and accuracy between 93 and 108% for QC samples with controlled volumes. For unknown spot volumes, OPNA metabolite concentrations were normalized to total blood protein to improve interpretation of nerve agent exposures. This study provides data to support the use of DBS and microsamplers to collect critical exposure samples quickly, safely, and efficiently following large-scale chemical exposure events.

AB Infrared (IR) imaging is an emerging and powerful approach for studying the molecular composition of cells and tissues. It is a non-destructive and phenotypic technique which combines label-free molecular specific information from cells and tissues provided by IR with spatial resolution, offering great potential in biochemical and biomedical research and routine applications. The application of multivariate discriminant analysis using bilinear models such as Partial Least Squares-Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA) to IR images requires to unfold the spatial directions in a two-way matrix, resulting in a loss of spatial information and structure. In this article, first we evidence that internal validation methods such as repeated k-fold cross-validation (CV) can be overly optimistic when the pixel size of the image is lower than the lateral spatial resolution. Secondly, we propose a new approach for the unbiased internal evaluation of the model performance named COnstrained Repeated Random SubsamplingeCross Validation (CORRS-CV). This method is based on the generation of q training and test sub-sets using a constrained random sampling of n training pixels without replacement and it circumvents overly optimistic effects due to oversampling, providing more accurate and robust images. The approach can be applied in IR microscopy for the development of discriminant models to analyse underlying biochemical differences associated to anatomical and histopathological features in cells and tissues.

AB Herein we present a diffractometric immunosensor to quantify low molecular weight organic compounds in a label-free, simple, and sensitive fashion. The approach is based on patterning analyte analogues (haptens) on solid surfaces according to a diffractive structure, and then loading specific antibodies on them to be subsequently displaced by free analytes in solution. This displacement generates a measurable change in the diffractive response that enables to quantify the analyte concentration. In this study we address the fabrication, optimization, and assessment of these diffractive structures of biological probes and their application to the analysis of atrazine, an organic compound extensively used as pesticide. This immunosensor displays well-correlated dose-response curves that reach a detection limit of 1.1 ngmL(-1) of atrazine in label-free conditions. From a general viewpoint, this study also aims to provide insights into exploiting this approach towards prospective in-field analysis and screening strategies to sense multiple low molecular weight compounds in label-free conditions.

AB Core-shell particle is a new generation high performance packing material for liquid chromatography. Through comparison with a classical totally porous silica phase of the same particle size, we studied Ascentis Express 5 mm core-shell particle's electrochromatographic behavior, in terms of voltage-current property, electroosmotic flow (EOF) and van Deemter curve. It was found, due to the nonpermeable solid core, the core-shell particle presented a diminished EOF and efficiency than the totally porous paricle. This on the other hand proved that the intra-particle pore flow extensively exists and plays an important role in electrochromatography on totally porous material. The core-shell particle's high retentivity led to an enhanced resolution for weakly retained hydrophilic peptides, which were poorly retained and co-eluted on totally porous particles. Further exploration has shown the core-shell material can achieve efficient electrochromatography of protein digests, excellent performance in terms of resolution, reproducibility and long term stability have been observed. The results indicate that the core-shell structure may suggest a reasonable design of stationary phase for bioelectrochromatography of peptides and proteins. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB Early diagnosis of diseases (before they become advanced and incurable) is essential to reduce morbidity and mortality rates. With the advent of novel technologies in clinical laboratory diagnosis, microbead-based arrays have come to be recognized as an efficient approach, that demonstrates useful advantages over traditional assay methods for multiple disease-related biomarkers. Multiplexed microbead assays provide a robust, rapid, specific, and cost-effective approach for high-throughput and simultaneous screening of many different targets. Biomolecular binding interactions occur after applying a biological sample (such as blood plasma, saliva, cerebrospinal fluid etc.) containing the target analyte(s) to a set of microbeads with different ligand-specificities that have been coded in planar or suspension arrays. The ligand-receptor binding activity is tracked by optical signals generated by means of flow cytometry analysis in the case of suspension arrays, or by image processing devices in the case of planar arrays. In this review paper, we discuss diagnosis of cancer, neurological and infectious diseases by using optically-encoded microbead-based arrays (both multiplexed and single-analyte assays) as a reliable tool for detection and quantification of various analytes.

AB Urinary analyte data has to be corrected for the sample specific dilution as the dilution varies intra-and interpersonally dramatically, leading to non-comparable concentration measures. Most methods of dilution correction utilized nowadays like probabilistic quotient normalization or total spectra normalization result in a division of the raw data by a dilution correction factor. Here, however, we show that the implicit assumption behind the application of division, log-linearity between the urinary flow rate and the raw urinary concentration, does not hold for analytes which are not in steady state in blood. We explicate the physiological reason for this short-coming in mathematical terms and demonstrate the empirical consequences via simulations and on multiple time-point metabolomic data, showing the insufficiency of division-based normalization procedures to account for the complex non-linear analyte specific dependencies on the urinary flow rate. By reformulating normalization as a regression problem, we propose an analyte specific way to remove the dilution variance via a flexible non-linear regression methodology which then was shown to be more effective in comparison to division-based normalization procedures. In the progress, we developed several, easily applicable methods of normalization diagnostics to decide on the method of dilution correction in a given sample. On the way, we identified furthermore the time-span since last urination as an important variance factor in urinary metabolome data which is until now completely neglected. In conclusion, we present strong theoretical and empirical evidence that normalization has to be analyte specific in dynamically influenced data. Accordingly, we developed a normalization methodology for removing the dilution variance in urinary data respecting the single analyte kinetics. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In the present work, a simultaneous derivatization and air-assisted liquid-liquid microextraction method based on the solidification of deep eutectic solvent coupled with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry has been developed for the determination of some aromatic amines in various aqueous samples. In this work, choline chloride and n-butyric acid are mixed at a suitable molar ratio and after heating, a deep eutectic solvent of low density compared to water is formed. The prepared extraction solvent is mixed with ethyl chloroformate as a derivatization agent and injected into an alkaline aqueous solution containing the target analytes adjusted at elevated temperature. The resulting mixture is drawn into a syringe via a needle and pushed out into a test tube several times. As a result, a cloudy solution consisting of the fine droplets of the extraction solvent containing the derivatized aromatic amines is obtained. Then, the solution is placed into an ice bath and the extraction solvent is solidified and collects on the top of the solution after centrifugation. Then the solidified extraction solvent is removed by a spatula and transferred to a microtube and dissolved in 10 mu L acetonitrile. A portion of the obtained mixture is injected into the gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Under optimum conditions, limits of detection and quantification were obtained in the ranges of 1.8-6.0, and 6.0-23 ng L-1, respectively. The extraction recoveries, enhancement factors, and enrichment factors of the selected aromatic amines ranged from 79-94%, 2498-3422 and 790-940, respectively. The relative standard deviations were similar to 5.3% for intrae (n = 6) and intereday (n = 4) precisions at a concentration of 100 ng L-1 of each analyte. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The importance of metabolites is assessed based on their abundance. Most of the metabolites are at present identified based on ESI/MS measurements and the relative abundance is assessed from the relative peak areas of these metabolites. Unfortunately, relative intensities can be highly misleading as different compounds ionise with vastly different efficiency in the ESI source and matrix components may cause severe ionisation suppression. In order to reduce this inaccuracy, we propose predicting the ionisation efficiencies of the analytes in seven biological matrices (neat solvent, blood, plasma, urine, cerebrospinal fluid, brain and liver tissue homogenates). We demonstrate, that this approach may lead to an order of magnitude increase in accuracy even in complicated matrices. For the analyses of 10 compounds, mostly drugs, in negative electrospray ionisation mode we reduce the predicted abundance mismatch compared to the actual abundance on average from 660 to 8 times. The ionisation efficiencies were predicted based on i) the charge delocalisation parameterWAPS and ii) the degree of ionisation a, and the prediction model was subsequently validated based on the cross-validation method 'leave-one-out'.

AB In this study, a slug-flow microextraction (SFME) coupled with paper spray mass spectrometry (PS-MS) method was developed for rapid and on-site analysis of trace amphetamine-type illicit drugs including amphetamine (AM), methamphetamine (MA) and 3,4-methylenedioxy-N-methylamphetamine (MDMA) in complex biological samples such as whole blood and raw urine. The method involved the application of SFME for rapid extraction of trace amphetamine-type illicit drugs from whole blood and raw urine samples, followed by PS for direct MS analysis under ambient and open-air conditions. The experimental parameters including extraction solvent, extraction cycle, high voltage, and spray solvent, etc., were all investigated, and the optimized conditions showed an enhanced sensitivity of 1-2 order of magnitudes compared with PS-MS. The method showed good linearity, with correlation coefficient values (r) of no less than 0.9979 for analysis of AM, MA, and MDMA in human whole blood and raw urine without additional sample pretreatments. The limits of detection and quantification were 0.01-0.05 ng/mL and 0.05-0.2 ng/mL, respectively. Satisfactory recoveries were also obtained, with 74.2-94.9% for whole blood and 80.2-103.6% for raw urine, respectively. All of our experimental results demonstrated that SFME-PS-MS showed great potential for rapid, on-site, in situ, and high-throughput screening of amphetamine-type illicit drugs in various biological samples.

AB Online monitoring of end-tidal propofol provides important information of anesthesia deepness for anesthetists as propofol concentrations in plasma and breath are well correlated. In this work, a dopant-assisted photoionization positive ion mobility spectrometry (DAPI-PIMS) coupled with time-resolved purge introduction was developed for online quantitative monitoring end-tidal propofol. With optimized dopant, toluene, the selectivity and sensitivity of propofol was improved as interference from sevoflurane was eliminated. Using the time-resolved purge introduction, the response of propofol and moisture was separated due to their absorption differences on the inwall of the fluorinated ethylene propylene (FEP) sample loop, ensuring sensitive measurement of end-tidal propofol with a short response time of 4 s. The quantitative equation derived from the second order reaction kinetics model extended the quantitative range of propofol from 0.2 ppbv to 45 ppbv. Finally, the method was used to monitor the intraoperative end-tidal propofol of six patients, and the results nicely demonstrated its feasibility in practical clinical environment.

Combining the features between MOFs and 2-D nanomaterials, the NTU-9 nanosheets matrix also demonstrated suitable band gap energy and superior photoabsorption properties, much better than other representative MOFs. A wide range of small molecules that involving low mass region were also analyzed with NTU-9 nanosheets as the matrices in both positive-ion and negative-ion reflector modes.

AB We propose a position-sensitive measurement method for tracking resonant signals of surface plasmon resonance (SPR) in periodic metallic nanostructures. Compared with conventional measurement methods, such as wavelength interrogation, intensity interrogation and spectral integration, this approach provides superior noise reduction and simple calculation process. Experimental results show that the limit of detection reaches to 5.88 x 10(-6) RIU by using a portable spectrometer with a spectral resolution of 0.4 nm. The relationship between shot noise and signal noise was theoretically compared. The superior noise reduction of the resonant position tracking method is useful for the smartphone-based SPR measurement. The protein-antibody interactions using the smartphone and gold nanoslit arrays as the SPR sensor are demonstrated. It verifies that a smartphone can be used for sensitive measurement of binding-kinetics of the proteins. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A fluorescence polarization (FP) assay based on estrogen receptor was developed for the determination of bisphenol compounds (BPs). The human estrogen receptor a ligand binding domain (hER alpha-LBD) and coumestrol were employed as recognition element and fluorescent probe, respectively. Competitive displacement of tracer from receptor suggested that BPs exhibited dose-dependent binding to hER alpha-LBD. In order to elucidate the structural basis for the interaction between BPs and hER alpha-LBD, molecular dynamics simulations were performed to explore their complexation mechanism. The docked bisphenol compounds adopted agonist/antagonist conformations with varying positions and orientations in the hydrophobic binding pocket, depending on their structural characteristics of bridging moieties. Interestingly, the calculated binding energies were generally correlated with the experimentally measured affinities, indicating a potential advantage of the molecular modeling approach in predicting the binding potencies of putative ligands. Considering that the real samples may contain more than one BP, the established FP assay can potentially be used as a pre-screening method to determine the total amounts of bisphenol compounds.

AB The accurate and rapid fungaltoxin detection at early stage can prevent people from getting cancer to a great extent. Here, an ultrasensitive electrochemical immunosensor for the detection of ochratoxin A was reported. Octahedral gold nanoparticles (Oct Au NPs) with edge and sharp corners as substrate materials can connect more primary antibodies and Au octahedron plasmonic colloidosomes (Au Oct PCs) were formed by the natural settlement of the Oct Au NPs in the inverse emulsion system. Au Oct PCs with high specific surface area and good electron transfer ability can hybridize with electron mediator toluidine blue to act as labels to amplify the output signal and ameliorate the stability of the immunosensor. The immunoassay was performed via the square wave voltammetry and showed a strong current response. The proposed immunosensor obtained a wide linear range from 0.1 pg mL(-1) to 10 ng mL(-1) and a low detection limit of 39 fg mL(-1). This new strategy achieved favorable stability, reproducibility and selectivity, which had potential application in real sample analysis. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A glucose biosensor was developed based on a 4-cyano-4'-pentylbiphenyl (5CB)-filled transmission electron microscopy (TEM) grid cell by coating poly (styrene-b-acrylic acid) (PS-b-PAA) at the 5CB/aqueous interface and immobilising 3-aminophenyl boronic acid (APBA) on the PAA block chains by N-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-N-ethylcarbodiimide coupling. Binding events between APBA and glucose were translated into homeotropic-to-planar configurational changes of 5CB, which were observed by polarised optical microscopy (POM) under crossed polarisers. This liquid-crystal-based glucose biosensor exhibited high sensitivity (limit of detection: 0.1 mM), even in complex serum and urine samples, high selectivity (against cholesterol, haemoglobin, and urea), and good stability for 40 d. This new and sensitive glucose biosensor has the advantages of low production cost, a simple immobilisation technique, and easy detection with POM, and may be useful for pre-screening glucose levels in human samples (serum and urine).

AB A multiplexed chemiluminescence (CL) imaging assay was designed for sensitive screen detection of a panel of protein biomarkers by integrating DNA microarray with proximity binding-induced hybridization chain reaction (HCR) amplification. The DNA microarray was manufactured by printing hairpin DNAs for different analytes detection in an array format onto the sensing cells arranged on an aldehydefunctionalized glass chip. The existence of target proteins induced the formation of sandwich immunocomplexes along with the hybridization of DNA strands labeled on the pair of antibodies via proximity effect, which subsequently unfolded their corresponding spotting hairpin DNAs to expose prelocked primer and trigger HCR assembly. Through the streptavidin-biotin conjugation, numerous horseradish peroxidase (HRP) was coupled on the HCR assemblies to catalyze H2O2-luminol reaction and produce amplified CL signals for sensitive CL imaging assay of protein targets. As a proof of concept, the DNA microarray was used to CL imaging assay of carcinoembryonic antigen, alpha-fetoprotein and carcinoma antigen 125 in ranges of 0.05-500 ng mL(-1), 0.06-600 ng mL(-1) and 0.02-200 U mL(-1), respectively. The CL microarray imaging assay could also be extended to screen detect other biomarker groups by printing different hairpin DNAs on the microarray and using corresponding antibody-DNA pairs. The proposed CL microarray imaging assay showed advantages of small sample consumption, good cost effectiveness, and multiplex detection performance, exhibiting good applicability in clinical diagnosis.

AB Tyrosine phosphorylation, as a hallmark in cellular signal transduction, is important for a diverse array of cellular processes, such as proliferation, metabolism, motility, and survival. Aberrant tyrosine phosphorylation plays a causal role in many diseases, especially the cancer. Detecting protein phosphorylation status in the cancer cells or tissues is vital for assessing the pathological phase, discovering the cancer biomarkers, and identifying the drug targets. However, the common biochemical detection methods remain through anti-pTyr antibodies, which are known to have limited sensitivity, poor reproducibility and high cost. Recent studies have proved that superbinder SH2 domain is a good replacement of anti-pTyr antibodies for the specific enrichment of pTyr peptides in phosphoproteomics analysis. In this work, we exploited a series of affinity reagents based on superbinder SH2 derived from Src protein for detecting the pTyr-containing proteins to replace anti-pY antibodies in immunoblotting and immunofluorescence techniques. The excellent performance of HRP-sSH2 and EGFP-sSH2 was verified by the analysis of several different tumor cell samples and was compared with most commonly used commercial antibodies. EGFP-sSH2-(Arg)(9) might be applied as the probe for direct fluorescence imaging in live cells via efficiently penetrating cell membranes and specifically binding with pTyr proteins. In summary, we have developed three novel, convenient, sensitive, and cost-effective affinity reagents that would have wide applications in protein tyrosine phosphorylation analysis for the tumor research and clinical diagnosis.

AB Zwitterion-modification, as a bioinspired strategy, provides greatly promising platforms for biological detection and sensor applications. A green, low-cost and straight-forward method for synthesis of highly fluorescent biomimetic carbon quantum dots (BCQDs) has been developed via pyrolysis of cytidine diphosphate choline (CDPC) and ethylenediamine. The BCQDs with a strong emission at wavelength of 450 nm shows ultrasensitive sensing capability for vitamin B12 with high selectivity. Using the fluorometric assay, the detection limit (DL) for vitamin B12 was found to be as low as 81 nM. Meanwhile, the results of 3-(4,5)-dimethylthiahiazo(-z-y1)-3,5-di-phenytetrazoliumromide (MTT), hemolysis measuring and morphological characterization of Red blood cells (RBCs) confirms the excellent biocompatibility of BCQDs. The imaging experiments of human cervical cancer cells (HeLa) certify that BCQDs could be served as an effective fluorescent sensing probe for label-free sensitive and selective detection of vitamin B12 in biological samples on account of their low toxicity and good biocompatibility. The BCQDs, further, were successfully applied to probe vitamin B12 in living cells, which broaden its potential application in vivo system. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Oligo(acrylic acid), oligoAA are important species currently used industrially in the stabilization of paints and also for the production of self-assembled polymer structures which have been shown to have useful applications in analytical separation methods and potentially in drug delivery systems. To properly tailor the synthesis of oligoAA, and its block co-oligomers synthesized by Reversible-Addition Fragmentation chain Transfer (RAFT) polymerization to applications, detailed knowledge about the chemical structure is needed. Commonly used techniques such as Size Exclusion Chromatography (SEC) and Electrospray Ionization-Mass Spectrometry (ESI-MS) suffer from poor resolution and non-quantitative distributions, respectively. In this work free solution Capillary Electrophoresis (CE) has been thoroughly investigated as an alternative, allowing for the separation of oligoAA by molar mass and the RAFT agent end group. The method was then extended to block co-oligomers of acrylic acid and styrene. Peak capacities up to 426 were observed for these 1D CE separations, 10 times greater than what has been achieved for Liquid Chromatography (LC) of oligostyrenes. To provide a comprehensive insight into the chemical structure of these materials H-1 and C-13 Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy was used to provide an accurate average chain length and reveal the presence of branching. The chain length at which branching is detected was investigated with the results showing a degree of branching of 1% of the monomer units in oligoAA with an average chain length of 9 monomer units, which was the shortest chain length at which branching could be detected. This branching is suspected to be a result of both intermolecular and intramolecular transfer reactions. The combination of free solution CE and NMR spectroscopy is shown to provide a near complete elucidation of the chemical structure of oligoAA including the average chain length and branching as well as the chain length and RAFT agent end group distribution. Furthermore, the purity in terms of the dead chains and unreacted RAFT agent was quantified. The use of free solution CE and H-1 NMR spectroscopy demonstrated in this work can be routinely applied to oligoelectrolytes and their block co-oligomers to provide an accurate characterization which allows for better design of the materials produced from these oligomers.

AB After the serious nuclear accident at the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant caused by the Great East Japan Earthquake in 2011, the development of feasible, safe, and highly sensitive analytical methods (in terms of low levels of radiation exposure and radioactive waste generation) for radioactive samples, especially actinide (An) ions, represents an important challenge. Here we propose a methodology for selecting appropriate emissive probes for An ions with very low consumption and emission of radioactivity by capillary electrophoresis-laser-induced fluorescence detection (CE-LIF), using a small chemical library of probes with eight different chelating moieties. It was found that the emissive probe L1, which possesses the tetradentate chelating moiety 1,10-phenanthroline-2,9-dicarboxylic acid (PDA), was suitable for detecting uranyl ions. The detection limit for the uranyl-L1 complex using CE-LIF combined with dynamic ternary complexation and on-capillary concentration techniques was determined to be 2.9 x 10(-12) M (0.7 ppt). No interference from the large excess of matrix metal ions was observed. This method was successfully applied to real radioactive liquid samples collected from nuclear facilities, including the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant. This strategy not only permitted the development of a safe and rapid analytical method but also provided insight into the coordination chemistry of An ion complexes. Specifically, the PDA structure provided substantial kinetic inertness to its uranyl complex; the formation of a ternary complex between uranyl-L1 and carbonate was revealed; and unusual interactions were observed between the pi-electron systems of uranyl and the phenanthroline ring, which stabilized the uranyl-PDA interaction.

AB A new high sensitivity deep-UV LED photometric detector with a z-type flow cell (45 nL or 180 nL) for miniaturised and portable capillary liquid chromatography (LC) was designed and fabricated to overcome sensitivity limitations due to short pathlength in on-capillary detectors. The new detector has a 10 mm geometric pathlength and uses high intensity light-emitting diodes (LED) as light sources in the deep-UV range (254 nm and 280 nm). No optical reference was necessary due to the low drift in the signal. Stray light was minimized by the use of an adjustable slit with a 0.5mm pinhole. The direct relationship between absorbance and concentration was obtained using dichromate to evaluate the sensitivity and the linearity range of the detector. Performance of the miniaturised version was compared with that obtained from a commercial benchtop detector for capillary LC under the same conditions using the same optical z-cell. The miniaturised version exhibited a superior performance across all parameters, including 3 times higher effective pathlength, 4 times higher upper limit of detector linearity, and 2-5 times lower stray light levels. An application of the new detector was shown with the detection of L-dopa, L-tyrosine, norfenefrine, phenylephrine and tyramine, separated using capillary LC. The baseline noise level recorded was as low as 3.9 mu AU. Further, the detector was applied in a miniaturised capillary LC for the indirect detection of common inorganic anions. In comparison to an on-capillary LED detector applied under similar chromatographic conditions, there was a 50 times higher signal to noise (S/N) ratio. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this work, a direct in-flow methodology for the acquisition of excitation-emission fluorescence matrices is presented. The system is particularly suited for measurements in the order of tens of milliseconds. A light source operated in continuous mode is dispersed through a grating and focused onto a square-section capillary. Under the spatially resolved excitation, the emission is collected, dispersed through a second grating and further focused onto a CCD array sensor. To allow the wavelength accuracy, a spectral calibration was performed registering the scattering signal of a dispersive element using interference filters ranging from 340 nm to 740 nm. The theoretical performance of the method was analyzed and second-order data obtained for different analyte mixtures are presented and discussed. PARAFAC was applied to evaluate the trilinearity of the obtained data. Mathematical evaluation by means of the criterion of similarity corroborates the agreement between experimental pure spectra and spectral profiles retrieved from PARAFAC. Moreover, the feasibility of the spectrometer to obtain second-order data for analyses with quantitative aims was demonstrated. Finally, fast data acquisition was proved by monitoring a chromatographic analysis of dye mixtures for the generation of third-order LC-EEM data. Here, an improvement in the resolution of the different instrumental modes was demonstrated. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A direct on-line method based on the coupling of supercritical fluid extraction and supercritical fluid chromatography with triple quadrupole mass spectrometry detection (SFE-SFC-QqQ/MS) for selected carotenoids determination and apocarotenoids detection in intact human blood was developed for the first time. Carotenoids and apocarotenoids were identified by using the available standard together with full scan, selected ion monitoring (SIM), and multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) experiments. Moreover, beta-Cryptoxanthin, Zeaxanthin, beta-Carotene and Capsanthin were directly quantified by the developed methodology, using a multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) approach; the determined average content of beta-carotene was 123.8 nmol L-1 (range 18.7-485.1 nmol L-1), of beta-cryptoxanthin was 385.3 nmol L-1 (range 72.5-1920.3 nmol L-1), of zeaxanthin was 396.9 nmol L-1 (range < LoD - 1795.8 nmol L-1) and of capsanthin was 38.9 nmol L-1 (range < LoD - 188.4 nmol L-1). Analyses were carried out on 10 mu L aliquots of intact blood samples without any preliminary treatment; the online extraction and chromatographic separation time was just over 20 min. The method was validated in terms of linearity, precision, limits of detection and quantification, and accuracy. Interestingly, beta-apo-120-carotenal, apo100- zeaxanthinal, apo-120-zeaxanthinal, apo-140-zeaxanthinal, epsilon-apo-8-luteinal, epsilon-apo-12-luteinal and epsilon-apo-14-luteinal were detected in human blood, together with two zeaxanthin fatty acid esters, for the first time.

AB A multiclass screening method to detect fifty-three forbidden substances by liquid-chromatography coupled to hybrid high-resolution mass spectrometry (LC-Q-Orbitrap) was developed and validated in bovine bile and urine. Eight classes of compounds were included in the method's scope (beta-agonists, corticosteroids, nitroimidazoles, progestins, resorcylic acid lactones (RALs), sedatives, steroids and stilbenes) plus chloramphenicol and dapsone. After hydrolysis, the sample was divided in two aliquots, which followed two parallel purification steps. The reunified extracts were injected and two chromatographic runs performed in positive and negative ionization mode, respectively. The validation data (60 different samples per matrix) proved that the method was fit for purpose with detection capabilities lower than 1 mg L-1 in both matrices. The combined application of accurate mass acquisition and two-stage mass spectrometry (parallel reaction monitoring) was crucial to achieve suitable selectivity, which is the most critical parameter mainly for urines. Finally, the long-standing problem of the high rate of false positive results for RALs, due to the natural ingestion of mycotoxin, zearalenone, was taken on including all their labelled standards. That allowed a very satisfactory management of this screening test. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB We demonstrate that gallium indium (GaIn) eutectic can be used to create interesting crystalline Si/porous silicon (cSi/pSi) platforms that exhibit unique analyte- and spatially-dependent photoluminescence (PL) responses. Here we characterize these cSi/pSi regions by using profilometry, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), wide-field PL microscopy, and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) microscopy. As we move along a vector from the cSi/pSi interface out into "bulk" pSi, the: (i) analyte-dependent, PL-based response initially increases and then decreases; (ii) total PL emission intensity, in the absence of analyte, increases; (iii) pSi thickness increases; and (iv) relative O2Si-H to Si-H band amplitude ratio decreases. Thus, the analyte- dependent PL response magnitude is correlated to the extent of pSi oxidation; which can be easily controlled by using GaIn eutectic as a mask during the pSi fabrication process.

AB Capillary electrophoresis (CE) presents many advantageous features as an analytical technique in metabolomics, such as very low consumption of a sample or the possibility to easily detect very polar and ionizable compounds. However, CE remains an approach only used by a few research groups due to a relatively lower sensitivity and, higher analysis time compared to liquid chromatography. To circumvent these drawbacks, herein we propose a generic CE-mass spectrometry (MS) approach using positive electrospray ionization mode and performing normal- and reverse-polarity CE separations to analyze anionic and acidic compounds. Preliminary experiments showed better sensitivity using the ESI positive mode compared to the ESI negative mode on a set of representative anionic compounds from different biochemical families. This approach was applied to the investigation of an available library of metabolites. More than 450 compounds out of the 596 in the library were detected, with the possibility to monitor negatively ionizable compounds through their ammonium adducts. Migration time of each data point was converted to an effective mobility (mu(eff)) scale and used for peak alignment in data preprocessing; mu(eff) features were used as a robust migration index for peak annotation and identification criterion. For the first time, a large database based on experimental mu(eff) was built, allowing for the straightforward annotation of detected features in biological samples and demonstrating how CE-MS can complement other analytical techniques commonly used in metabolomics.

AB Recent advances in nanotechnology have opened a lot of new possibilities for nanomaterials application in wide variety of industrial, pharmaceutical, medicinal and environmental applications. This review aims to description of various Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR)-based spectroscopic techniques suitable to characterize (i) different types of nanomaterials and (ii) various macroscopic samples at their nanoscale. In the introductory section, nanomaterials are classified according to their crucial properties, i.e. chemical composition, size and surface morphology. Application of traditional FTIR techniques, such as Attenuated Total Reflection (ATR), Diffuse Reflection (DRIFT) and infrared micro (spectro) scopy, for characterization of nanomaterials and nanostructures is compared with novel optical nanoscopic techniques derived from scanning probe microscopy which enable to overcome the diffraction limit and to characterize nanomaterials at molecular scale.

AB This article reviews the synthesis and uses of nanoparticle-based hybrid monoliths in microextraction techniques. Synthesizing monolithic solids containing nanoparticles allows the advantages of the two sorbent phases to be synergistically combined. The resulting hybrid material exhibits outstanding capabilities for isolating the target compounds from the samples. In addition to conventional in-cartridge solid-phase extraction, the monoliths can be easily adapted for use in most of the usual formats of micro-solid phase extraction including capillaries, pipette tips, spin columns, microfluidic chips and stirred units. The most salient uses devised so far are described and critically discussed in this article, which deals with both silica and organic monolithic solids modified with nanostructured materials including carbonaceous and metal or metal oxide nanoparticles.

AB The sol-gel synthesized NiO nanoparticles were characterized and used for the modification of a carbon paste electrode (CPE) in electrocatalytic voltammetric determination of sulfasalazine. Calcination temperature of NiO had an important role on the peak current of the modified NiO-CPE and calcined NiO at 200 degrees C had the best and maximum peak current for the corresponding electrode. Jahn-Teller and a Z-out effects for the singlet electrons in their 3d(z)(2) orbital for calcined NiO at 200 degrees C relatively instable such electrons and hence they can easily participate in the electro-oxidation process. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) results confirmed that the modified CPE by calcined NiO at 200 degrees C has lower charge transfer resistance. In interaction effects study between the experimental variables by using the response surface methodology (RSM) approach, the optimized run included the 17.5% of NiO modifier, 0.5 M NaOH, amplitude of 295 mV, step potential of 7 mV and frequency of 15 Hz. A calibration plot in the range of 0.009-1.6 mu M with limits of detection (LOD) and quantification (LOQ) of 0.002 and 0.006 mu M was obtained, respectively. The modified electrode showed good selectivity and applicability for SSZ determination in complex matrixes. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB To clarify the morphology effect of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) on their electrochemistry as well as to explore their electrochemical applications, three MOFs with metal centers of nickel, cobalt, and zinc are synthesized. The used organic ligand is only 1,3,5-benzenetricarboxylic acid. Characterizations using Fourier Transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, and electrochemical techniques reveal that these MOFs possess similar bonding properties, crystalline structures and phase purity, but various morphology and electrochemical activities, including their own redox behavior, electrochemical response toward redox probes and analytes in solutions. As a case study of analytes, voltammetry of Ponceau 4R is investigated on three MOFs. Its sensitive and selective monitoring is further achieved on nickel MOFs with a linear range from 0.5 to 150 nM and a detection limit of 80 pM. Therefore, the morphology of MOFs determines electrochemistry of MOFs and their electrochemical sensing applications. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Calcium is closely related to the oceanic biosphere and carbonate system. Potentiometry based on a calcium-selective electrode (Ca-ISE) represents a promising tool for detection of calcium ion activities in seawater. This technique, however, generally is limited by the low sensitivity for the inherent Nernstian response (i.e. ca 30 mV/dec). A current pulse based ion-selective electrode with enhanced sensitivity for chronopotentiometric measurements of calcium in seawater is proposed. The Ca2+-selective membrane containing lipophilic salt ETH 500 instead of traditional ion-exchanger is galvanostatically controlled. An applied constant cathodic current pulse can leads to the extraction of the calcium ions into the membrane to produce a chronopotential response, which shows a stable and reproducible super-Nernstian response in a narrow calcium activity range. The super-Nernstian region of the electrode depends on not only the the magnitude and duration of the applied current pulse but also the interfering ions. Under optimal conditions, the proposed Ca-ISE exhibits a super-Nernstian response between the calcium concentrations of 10(-)(2.5)-10(-)(1.5)M with a slope of ca 80 mV/dec. The current pulse based Ca-ISE has been applied to determination of calcium in seawater with satisfactory results. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB A novel poly(glycine) (p-GLY)/graphene oxide (GO) composite based sensor (p-GLY/GO) was successfully prepared on glassy carbon electrode by simple electropolymerization. Electrochemical responses of analytes on p-GLY/GO modified electrode were studied by cyclic voltammetry and differential pulse voltammetry. The results demonstrated that p-GLY/GO modified electrode showed a favorable application for the simultaneous determination of dopamine (DA), uric acid (UA), guanine (GU) and adenine (AD). Owing to the synergistic effect of p-GLY and GO, the oxidation peaks of four analytes separated well from each other, and the potential separations of oxidation peaks of DA-UA, UA-GU and GU-AD were large up to 170, 350 and 300 mV, respectively. As-prepared p-GLY/GO modified electrode offered wide linear responses for DA, UA, GU and AD over the ranges of 0.20-62, 0.10-105, 0.15-48 and 0.090 -103 mu M with detection limits of 0.011, 0.061, 0.026 and 0.030 mu M (S/N = 3), respectively. Moreover, p-GLY/GO modified electrode presented favorable selectivity, stability and reproducibility, which was a promising candidate as an electrochemical sensor for the simultaneous determination of DA, UA, GU and AD.

AB The present work aimed at the development of a simple and accurate direct immersion-solidphase microextraction-gas-chromatography-mass spectrometry (DI-SPME-GC-MS) method for simultaneous determination of PAHs, PCBs, and pesticide residues in edible seaweeds. As the target contaminants possess a wide range of physical-chemical properties, multivariate experimental design was used for method optimization. In particular, two different methods were optimized and validated: one that allows for simultaneous determination of all targets, and an ad hoc method for determination of hydrophobic analytes, a class that often poses a challenge for extraction from food matrices. Optimum conditions suitable for simultaneous quantitation of all targeted compounds, namely buffer at pH = 7.0, 20% acetone (v/v), 10% NaCl (w/w), 0.02% NaN3, 60 min DI extraction at 55 degrees C, and 20 min desorption at 270 degrees C, afforded limits of quantitation (LOQs) in the range of 1-30 mu g kg(-1), a wide linear range of 5 -2000 mu g kg(-1), the attainment of satisfactory determination coefficients (R(2>)0.99) with no significant lack of fit (p > 0.05) at the 5% level, and satisfactory accuracy and precision values. By modifying the extraction conditions to favor extraction of the most hydrophobic analytes (e.g. higher amount of organic modifier and pH, and lower salt content) lower LOQs were obtained for these compounds ranging from 0.2 to 13.3 lig kg -1. The established methods were then used for screening of commercial, edible dry seaweeds, with PCBs (<= 16.0 ng g(-1) ) and PAHs (<= 15.5 ng g(-1)) detected in some samples. This method overcomes most challenges commonly encountered in dry sample analysis applications, and represents the first report of a DI-SPME method employing the matrix-compatible fiber for simultaneous multiclass and multiresidue analysis of seaweeds.

AB A new method for simultaneous measurement of fifteen rare earth elements (REEs) [La (III), Ce (III), Pr (III), Nd (III), Sm (III), Eu (III), Gd (III), Tb (III), Dy (III), Ho (III), Er (III), Tm (III), Yb (III), Lu (III), and Y (III)] was established in this study using the diffusive gradients in thin films (DGT) technique with Chelex (R) 100 binding gel. Five different types of ion exchange resins (Chelex (R) 100, D418, D001-cc, 001 x 7, and HSTY (R)-SS) were selected for the initial investigation of their adsorption performance for REEs. The Chelex (R) 100 binding gel had the greatest uptake efficiencies of >95% for the fifteen REE ions, which was used for all subsequent experiments. The binding gel exhibited rapid binding dynamics to REEs in mixed solution of the fifteen REE ions. Elution efficiencies ranging from 86.5% to 93.8% for these REEs were obtained based on extraction using 2.0 M HCl. The Chelex (R) 100 DGT uptake of the fifteen REE ions increased linearly with the deployment time and found to be independent of pH (3-9) and ionic strength (3 mM-100 mM). The capacities of Chelex (R) 100 DGT for measurement of the mixed elements were determined at a range of 5.39-6.75 mu g cm(-2). Application of the DGT for soil analysis showed that Chelex (R) 100 DGT was a useful tool in simultaneous measurement of the fifteen REE ions, even in a soil with high concentrations of REEs. This study demonstrated the advantage of Chelex (R) 100 DGT in simultaneous measurement of the fifteen REE ions due to high uptake efficiencies and a wide tolerance to environmental interference.

AB Natural medicinal substances (NMS) have great inconsistency due to chemical variability, seriously limiting their development as therapeutics. Here, we chose toad venom with anti-tumor activities as a model and developed a pipeline of metabolomics-based screening and quality consistency control (MSQCC) as one potential solution to this long-standing problem. Our study firstly exemplified the power of the co-correlation screen of metabolomic and biological profiles of 180 fractions prepared from natural heterogeneous venom samples, to identify a series of bufadinolides as quality control markers for cancer cell inhibition. The next quantitative monitoring of these markers revealed great batch-to-batch variation of toad venoms. Finally, we developed a marker-based blending program (Markers-NMBT) to normalize heterogeneity of NMS. It created the blends for the conversion of the unqualified venoms with high variation in the contents of bufadienolides, into qualified products consistent with the reference. Thus, this work provides a strategy for rapid, large-scale discovery, quantification and application of quality control markers to ensure batch-to-batch consistency, and can be a crucial technology in the development of modern NMS preparations.

AB Abscisic acid (ABA), indoleacetic acid (IAA) and jasmonic acid (JA) are plant hormones that were reported to play indispensable roles during seed germination. However, the interactions between these plant hormones during rice seed germination have still not been explored clearly. A sensitive method for determination of these plant hormones would be beneficial for the exploration of such interactions. Herein, we present a liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (LC-MS) method for the quantification of ABA, IAA and JA in a single tissue of rice seed to investigate the spatio-temporal distribution of these plant hormones during rice seed germination. To this end, an in silico strategy was developed in order to select a derivatization reagent with an ideal sensitivity of MS detection. This strategy was confirmed with experimental studies on three reagents N-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-N'-ethylcarbodiimide (EDC), N,N-dimethylethylenediamine (DMED), and N-(acridin-9-yl)-2-bromoacetamide (AYBA) and their formic acid derivatives. Our results from the in silico and LC-MS experiments show that AYBA is a good derivatization reagent for ABA, IAA and JA due to its reasonable ionization efficiency in electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) and excellent hydrophobicity. Finally, a sensitive LC-MS method upon AYBA was established for the determination of ABA, IAA and JA in germinated seeds. Good linearities for ABA, IAA, and JA were obtained with correlation coefficients greater than 0.99. The limits of detection (LODs) were in the range of 0.14-0.16 pg mL(-1). The method exhibits good precisions with RSD 1.5%-13.8% (intra-day) and 1.2%-7.3% (inter-day) and acceptable recoveries (88.6%-102.9%, n= 6). Finally, the method was successfully employed in the spatio-temporal profiling of ABA, IAA and JA in a single tissue of rice seed during rice seed germination. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB A forced dried droplet method (FDD) is developed to overcome the drawbacks of the conventional dried droplet (DD) method for matrix assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) sample preparation. The crystals produced by the DD method are heterogeneous and irregularly distributed, and thus many methods have tried to solve the problems. However, most of them spend more time or need additional instruments to generate homogeneous microcrystals. The FDD sample preparation method can produce uniform microcrystals with homogeneous size distribution in few minutes without additional instruments. Stirring the sample spot solution (an agitation process) with a pipette tip can change the crystal size distribution which is observed by the microscope. Mass spectrometric analysis shows that the smaller the crystal size is, the better the ion signal intensity is. The formation of microcrystals can be explained with the effective rate of secondary nucleation. The relative standard deviation (RSD) of the FDD method is similar to 16% which is comparable to the two-layer (TL) method and is better than the DD method. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB Herein, a novel class-specific artificial receptor-based on molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP)-coated quantum dots (QDs@MIP) was synthesized, characterized, and used for the detection and quantification of the bacterial quorum signaling molecules N-acyl-homoserine lactones (AHLs), a class of autoinducers from Gram-negative bacteria. The QDs@MIP was prepared by surface imprinting technique under controlled conditions using CdSe/ZnS QDs as the signal transducing material. The synthesis of the QDs@MIP was characterized by transmission electron microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction analysis, and fluorescence spectroscopy. After template elution, the obtained cavities sensitively and selectively recognized the target AHLs of interest. The fluorescence intensity of the QDs@MIP was significantly quenched compared to the control non-imprinted polymer (QDs@NIP) upon exposure to different AHL concentrations. It also had a good linearity in the range from 2 to 18 nM along with a detection limit of 0.66, 0.54, 0.88, 0.72 and 0.68 nM for DMHF, C4-HSL, C6-HSL, C8-HSL and N-3oxo-C6-HSL, respectively. Most interestingly, the proposed sensor exhibited high sensitivity, good stability and fast response (30 s) towards the target molecules due to successful formation of surface imprints. The practicability of the developed sensor in real samples was further confirmed through the analysis of bacterial supernatant samples with satisfactory recoveries ranging from 89 to 103%. According to these results, the as-prepared QDs@MIP can be used as a new potential supporting technique for the rapid and real-time detection of bacterial pathogens in food safety and healthcare facilities.

AB The distance-dependent based sensing mechanism, such as fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) and surface plasmon resonance (SPR) absorption of gold nanoparticles, has been used widely in visual detection. In this work, we report another distance-dependent detection method for nucleoside triphosphates (NTPs) based on carbon dots (CDs) (O-1(2) donor) and 9, 10-diphenylanthracene-2-boronic acid (DABA, O-1(2) acceptor). The CDs can generate singlet oxygen (O-1(2)) which allows diffusion within 200 nm. Thus, the distance between CDs and DABA decreased through binding of NTPs (<200 nm), leading to absorption changes of DABA under light irradiation due to O-1(2) trapping. This sensing system (CDs@DABA) has high selectivity for the detection of NTPs due to the double molecular recognition and a linear response in the 0-80 mu M concentration range was accomplished with the detection limit as low as 4.35 mu M.

AB Hyperbilirubinemia is the condition when bilirubin exceeds normal concentration in body (19.80 mg/mL in newborns and 1.19 x 10(-2) mg/mL in adults). Bilirubin encephalopathy in newborns may cause irreversible neurological disorders. Current methods for detection of bilirubin suffer from compromising accuracy. In the present work, bovine serum albumin stabilized copper nanocluster (BSA-CuNCs) was synthesized via a one pot microwave assisted method as a turn on detector for bilirubin. The synthesized BSA-CuNCs having size less than 4 nm, exhibited bright blue emission at 405 nm. Interestingly, no observable change in fluorescence emission was noticed over a wide pH range (1-11) or at high ionic conditions. However, the interaction of Fe3+ with BSA-CuNCs induces quenching of fluorescence. Moreover, the fluorescence can be regained by the addition of bilirubin over other possible coexisting biomolecules. A good linearity was observed for BSA-CuNCs based turn on probe with a Limit of Detection (LoD) 6.62 nM. Furthermore, real sample analyses were carried out with human serum and urine which showed good recovery percentage. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Abnormally-expressed leucine aminopeptidase (LAP) is associated with diverse physiological and pathological disorders; hence developing a highly selective and sensitive detection system for LAP is of great significance. Herein, a fluorescent light-up system with aggregation-induced emission (ALE) characteristic, (DPA-TPE-Leu) has been developed for detecting LAP, in which the recognition unit L-leucine amide group also acts as the hydrophilic moiety. Upon LAP-triggered enzymatic reaction, L-leucine amide moiety is cleaved from the probe molecule, resulting in the formation and aggregation of the hydrophobic reaction product (DPE-TPE-OH) with AIE effect and thus giving out the turn-on green fluorescence. The system features excellent photostability, large Stokes shift (194 nm), good water solubility, high sensitivity with the detection limit of 0.16 U L-1, favorable specificity and low cytotoxicity. It has been effectively utilized in fluorescent imaging of endogenous LAP in living cells, and also successfully applied for fluorescent imaging of HepG2 xenograft tumor. Such a fluorescent assay could provide a convenient and sensitive method for detecting LAP activity and might aid in the auxiliary diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma and related pathological analysis in biopsy.

AB A non-destructive methodology based on Fourier Transformed Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) is proposed in this research to estimate the age of documents of different ages. Due the variability in the samples caused by their different chemical compositions, chemometric approaches were proposed to build one unique regression model able to determine the age of the paper regardless of its composition. PLS models were built employing Generalized Least Squares Weighting (GLSW) and Orthogonal Least Squares (OLS) filters to reduce the variability of samples from the same year. Afterwards, sparse PLS, which is an extension of the PLS model including a variable selection step, was applied to compare its performance with the preprocessing filters. All techniques proposed were compared to the initial PLS models, showing the potential of the chemometric approaches applied to FTIR data to estimate the age of unknown documents.

AB The resolution and quantitation of pure spectra of minority components in measurements of chemical mixtures without prior knowledge of the mixture is a challenging problem. In this work, a combination of band target entropy minimization (BTEM) and target partial least squares (T-PLS) was used to obtain estimates for single pure component spectra and to calibrate those estimates in a true, one-at-a-time fashion. This approach allows for minor components to be targeted and their relative amounts estimated in the presence of other varying components in spectral data. The use of T-PLS estimation is an improvement to the BTEM method because it overcomes the need to identify all of the pure components prior to estimation. Estimated amounts from this combination were found to be similar to those obtained from a standard method, multivariate curve resolution-alternating least squares (MCR-ALS), on a simple, three component mixture dataset. Studies from two experimental datasets demonstrate where the combination of BTEM and T-PLS was used to model the pure component spectra and to obtain concentration profiles of minor components, but MCR-ALS could not.

AB A simple and sensitive quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) immunosensing platform was designed for the high-efficient detection of aflatoxin B-1 (AFB(1)) in foodstuff. Initially, phenoxy-derived dextran molecule was immobilized on the surface of QCM gold substrate by using thiolated beta-cyclodextrin based on the supramolecular host-guest chemistry between phenoxy group and cyclodextrin. Then, AFB(1)-bovine serum albumin (AFB(1)-BSA)-conjugated concanavalin A (Con A) was assembled onto the QCM probe through the dextran-Con A interaction. Glucose-loaded nanoliposome, labeled with monocolonal anti-AFB(1) antibody, was used for the amplification of QCM signal. Upon target AFB(1) introduction, the analyte competed with the immobilized AFB(1)-BSA on the probe for the labeled anti-AFB(1) antibody on the nanoliposome. Based on specific antigen-antibody reaction, the amount of the conjugated nanoliposomes on the QCM probe gradually decreased with the increment of target AFB(1) in the sample. Upon injection of Triton X-100 in the detection cell, the carried nanoliposome was lysed to release the encapsulated glucose molecules. Thanks to the stronger affinity of Con A toward glucose than that of dextran, AFB(1)-BSA-labeled Con A was displaced from the QCM probe, resulting in the change of the local frequency. Under the optimum conditions, the shift of the functionalized QCM immunosensing interface in the frequency shift was proportional to the concentration of target AFB(1) within a dynamic range from 1.0 ng kg(-1) to 10 mu g kg(-1) at a low detection limit of 0.83 ng kg(-1). In addition, the acceptable assayed results on precision, reproducibility, specificity and method accuracy for the analysis of real samples were also acquired. Importantly, our strategy can provide a signal-on competitive immunoassay for the detection of small molecules, e.g., mycotoxins and biotoxins, thereby representing a versatile sensing schemes by controlling the corresponding antibody or hapten in the analysis of food safety.

AB Ra-226 is a natural radioelement emitting alpha and gamma radiations. It can be highly concentrated in TENORM materials from the petroleum or fertilizer industries. In Switzerland, Ra-226 is currently a radioactive inheritance problem from the watch industry. Furthermore, Ra-223 is a radium isotope used in nuclear medicine to treat bone metastasis. There exist several methods to measure radium using alpha or gamma spectrometry or using Rn-222 emanation technique. The limitations of these methods are due to the required detection limits and the nature of the samples. When using alpha spectrometry to reach very low detection limits, critical technical hitches often arise because of the difficulties in separating radium from barium, in removing organics eluted from the separating chromatography column, and in plating radium. Moreover, overall chemical recovery of radium is often not reproducible, depending on the studies.
   Here we propose a method that separates radium from other alkaline-earth cations using cation exchange chromatography and selective complex formation by EDTA and DCTA. Radium is completely free of the( 229)Th tracer and its daughter products, particularly Ac-225. Organics from the column are removed in a further purification step so that radium can be plated with acceptable yields in a HCl/HNO3/ethanol solution. We successfully applied the method to soil, water, urine and human bone samples and further extended it to the determination of Ra-223 in a bone biopsy, using Ra-226 as an internal tracer.

AB Lipid mediators play an important role as biological messengers involved in inflammatory processes. Deriving from different polyunsaturated fatty acids, endogenously built mediators featuring both pro- and anti-inflammatory properties as well as pro-resolving lipid mediators and their biological precursors have been investigated. A newly developed method using chiral chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry on human plasma has demonstrated its suitability for the simultaneous determination of prostaglandins, lipoxins, D-series derived resolvins as well as protectins, maresin 1, leukotriene B4 and several precursors of them in order to yield information about metabolic pathways. Due to the matrix complexity, a solid phase extraction method using an octadecyl-modified silica gel cartridge was carried out. The developed method allows the determination of 34 analytes in 25 min showing enough selectivity as well as precision and accuracy (<= 15% relative standard deviation, <= 15% relative error) in the calibration range of 0.1-10 ng mL(-1) or 0.2-20 ng mL(-1) depending on the analytes. Stability of the analytes in plasma has been demonstrated for at least 3 hat room temperature, 72 h in the autosampler and 60 days in the freezer at -80 degrees C. This method has been validated and shown its suitability for the determination of all studied analytes in human plasma samples. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Metabolomic analysis of human biospecimens had progressed quickly over the past decade. Technological and methodological advances have led to the comprehensive characterization of human serum, urine, cerebrospinal fluid and saliva metabolomes, and the creation of freely available metabolome reference databases. Unfortunately, the characterization of the human fecal metabolome still lags behind these other metabolomes in terms of the availability of standardized methods and freely available resources. The purpose of this review is to bring the knowledge of the human fecal metabolome, and the methods to characterize it, to the same level as most other human biofluid metabolomes. More specifically, this review is intended to critically assess the field of fecal metabolomics and to provide a comprehensive review of the current state of knowledge with regard to the protocols, technologies and remaining challenges in fecal metabolite analysis. In addition to providing an overview of fecal metabolomics and some consensus recommendations, we also present the human fecal metabolome database (HFMDB - http://www.fecalmetabolome.ca), a freely available, manually curated resource that currently contains over 6000 identified human fecal metabolites. Each entry in the HFMDB includes extensive chemical information, metabolite descriptions and reference data in the same format as the Human Metabolome Database (HMDB).

AB Laser induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) is a versatile spectroscopic technique that requires little or no sample preparation and capable of simultaneous elemental sample analysis. Quantitative analysis of its spectra has been a major challenge due to self-absorption of the emitted radiation during plasma cooling and inadequate description of non-linear complex interactions taking place in the laser induced plasma. This work presents a novel chemo-metric tool, extreme learning machine (ELM) and its hybrid HHELM (homogenously hybridized ELM), for the first time in modeling the complex interactions of laser induced plasma and quantification of LIBS spectra. Internal reference preprocessing (IRP) method is also proposed as a novel method of enhancing the performance of ELM based chemo-metrics. Since the proposed chemo-metrics (ELM and HHELM) determine their input weights as well as their hidden biases in a random manner, ELM and HHELM are respectively hybridized with gravitational search algorithm (GSA) for optimization of the number of hidden neurons. Effect of IRP, obtained by normalizing the emission spectra intensities with the emission intensity that has highest upper level excitation energy and lowest transition probability, on the performance of the proposed GSA-ELM and GSA-HHELM chemo-metrics is investigated. The proposed models are implemented using spectra of seven bronze standard samples. Chemo-metrics with IRP (GSA-ELM-IRP and GSA-HHELM-IRP) show better generalization performance than those without IRP (GSA-ELM-WIRP and GSA-HHELM-WIRP) while GSA-HHELM based chemo-metrics perform better than their counterparts. The outstanding performance demonstrated by the proposed chemo-metrics and their self-absorption correction ability would definitely widen the applicability of LIBS and improve its precision for the quantitative analysis.

AB We have reported an effective electrochemical sensor for assorted pesticide (i.e., Fenitrothion). Exact tracking of these pesticides has become more important for protecting the environment and food resources owing to their high toxicity. Hence, the development of compatible sensors for the real-time detection of pesticides is imperative to overcome practical limitations encountered in conventional methodologies. In this regard, the role of the novel, advanced functional materials such as niobium carbide (NbC) supported on molybdenum nanoparticles (NbC@Mo) has drawn great consideration in conventional sensory systems because of their numerous advantages over other nanomaterials. The nanocomposite was characterized by XRD, XPS, HR-TEM, and EIS. Under optimized working conditions, the modified electrode NbC@Mo/SPCE responds linearly as 0.01-1889 mM concentration range and the detection limit is 0.15 nM. Most importantly, the method was successfully demonstrated in fruit samples. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The main aim of this work was to conduct the preliminary/ basic research concerning the preparation process of a new dummy molecularly imprinted polymer (DMIP) materials. Developed DMIPs were proposed as a sorption material in solid-phase extraction (SPE) technique for recognition of selected low mass polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) - PBDE-47 and PBDE-99. Four new DMIPs were synthesized employing bulky polymerization technique by application of structural analogue of low mass PBDEs - 4,4'-Dihydroxydiphenyl ether, as a dummy template. The DMIPs and corresponding non-imprinted polymers were prepared using different functional monomers: methacrylic acid; methyl methacrylate and different porogen agents: acetonitrile and tetrahydrofuran. The polymerization reaction was thermally initiated with 1,1'-azobis (cyclohexanecarbonitryle). Ethylene glycol dimethacrylate was applied as a cross-linker. To optimize geometries and to calculate energies of the respective template-monomer complexes, the computational molecular modeling method was employed. The particles morphology and physicochemical characteristics of developed DMIPs and their equivalent NIPs were performed using nitrogen sorption porosimetry, scanning electron microscopy, and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. The sorption capacities of prepared DMIPs and corresponding NIPs were studied using standard binding test. The adsorption capability studies give a possibility to assess the imprinting factor (IF) values, which were in the range from 1.1 to 4.0, depending on the DMIP type. The recovery values of PBDE-47 and PBDE-99 from prepared organic solutions were in the range from 43 to 92%, depending on the studied DMIP. Performed basic laboratory studies give a possibility to select the optimal DMIP material which might be applied in the environmental samples preparation process as a potential sorbent for the recognition of low mass PBDEs.

AB A macroporous adsorption resin (MAR) with similar to 10 mu m diameter was synthesized by seed-swelling polymerization and further modified with a layer of microporous organic polymers (MOP) by "one-pot" solvothermal reaction. The resulting MAR@MOP exhibited high specific surface area of 131.3 m(2)/g, which was higher than that of pristine MAR (57.8 m(2)/g). The contact angle also decreased from 58.8 degrees (MAR) to 24 degrees (MAR@MOP), indicating that the MOP was successfully grafted onto the surface of MAR. The chemical composition of MAR@MOP was confirmed by Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, C-13 NMR and element analysis. The enrichment efficiency of MAR@MOP to glycopeptides was demonstrated by trapping N-linked glycopeptides from tryptic digests of human immunoglobulin G (IgG), horseradish peroxidase (HRP) and bovine fetuin. Furthermore, 879 unique N-glycosylation sites in 811 unique glycopeptides sequence mapped to 516 N-glycosylated proteins were identified in three replicate analyses of proteins extracted from mouse liver. Therefore, this hydrophilic MOP-coated adsorbent would be applied in the enrichment and identification of low-abundance N-linked glycopeptides in complicated biological samples.

AB The misuse of the steroid hormone testosterone for performance enhancement has been frequently reported in the past, and its administration is prohibited in sports according to the regulations of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA). Testosterone is produced endogenously in human. Endogenous and exogenous testosterone together with their metabolites can be unambiguously distinguished by means of their carbon isotope ratios if compared to endogenous reference compounds. Established isotope ratio mass spectrometry methods for analyzing urinary steroids for doping control purposes consist of up to two time-consuming HPLC purification steps to achieve the required purity of all analytes. In order to accelerate the sample preparation, multidimensional gas chromatography was applied. This technique is known to be suitable for the separation of complex matrices. Multidimensional gas chromatography consists of two gas chromatographs connected by a pressure-controlled heart-cutting device. In the first dimension, a less polar capillary column was installed for peak purification. In the second dimension, separation was achieved employing a column of medium polarity. Retention time stability and transfer windows were monitored by a flame ionization detector. Detection was performed simultaneously by isotope ratio mass spectrometry and a single quadrupole mass spectrometer for analyte identity confirmation and assessment of peak purity.
   Instead of two working days required for the HPLC-based routine method, the sample preparation is shortened by the herein presented approach to one working day. For glucuronic acid-conjugated steroids, sample pretreatment is based on solid-phase extraction, liquid-liquid extraction, enzymatic hydrolysis, and derivatization of the target analytes to their corresponding acetates. These steroid acetates are divided according to their polarity into two fractions by solid phase extraction. Further, sulfoconjugated steroids are processed by Pseudomonas aeruginosa arylsulfatase and extracted following a recently established procedure.
   Following WADA guidelines, the method was validated by determining the parameters linear range, limit of quantification, intra-and interday precision, accuracy and specificity utilizing linear mixing models. Additionally, a reference population (n = 74) was investigated and the obtained data were compared to the established method. An excretion study was also conducted with 4-androstenedione to prove the fit for purpose of the methodology. The results demonstrate that the method is suitable for an application in routine doping control analysis. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Water scarcity is a problem worldwide, affecting specially countries with desert/semi-desert areas and low/irregular rainfall. In this context, reuse of reclaimed wastewater (RWW) for agricultural irrigation is undoubtedly a key strategy to reduce fresh water consumption. It is well-known that current wastewater treatments do not effectively remove organic microcontaminants (OMCs), and research in water analysis of OMCs is extensive. However, the focus on agricultural soils irrigated with RWWas potential recipients of OMCs and potential sources of OMCs to crops is still in their beginnings. This study aims to apply a target and a suspect approach for the multi-residue monitoring of OMCs in agricultural soils and a soilless subtract, both irrigated with RWW for more than ten years. The study involved, firstly, the development and validation of an extraction method for target analysis of 73 OMCs using a QuEChERSbased method and liquid chromatography coupled to quadrupole-linear ion trap mass spectrometry (LCQqLIT-MS/MS); and secondly, the application of a suspect workflow for the screening of a list of 1300 potential contaminants using LC coupled to quadrupole-time-of-flight MS (LC-QTOF-MS). The results demonstrated the occurrence of 11 OMCs in the agricultural soil samples and 26 in the soilless subtract (0.1-100 ng g(-1), dry weight, d.w.). The suspect analysis leaded to the confirmation of 28 OMCs analytes from the list of candidates. The subsequent combination of both strategies (suspect and target) revealed the presence of 11 new OMCs which were not previously reported. Furthermore, this study presents the first application of a OMCs suspect screening to agricultural soils irrigated with RWW for a long period. These results highlight the importance of monitoring soils with RWW-based irrigation and the application of wide-scope approaches for environmental analysis. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB Ambient mass spectrometry enables fast and direct analysis, requiring minimal or no sample preparation; these attributes have established it as the preferred technique for applications in numerous fields (e.g., biomedical, forensic, and environmental). Here we coupled an active capillary plasma ionization source based on a dielectric barrier discharge directly to solid-phase microextraction, achieving a quick (<10 min per sample), green (virtually no samples preparation and thus no solvents involved), sensitive (LODs up to 3 pg mL(-1)), robust (RSD of <20%), and quantitative (LDR >= 2 orders of magnitude) screening method. This study, moreover, shows that intrinsically poorer ionization efficiencies for low-polarity compounds (such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, PAHs), which precluded their ultra-trace detection, can be partially overcome by adding dopants and lowering the LODs into the pg mL(-1) range. Results also show that the presence of these dopants greatly affects the ionization mechanism, resulting in the preferential formation of radical cations versus protonated PAHs. As a proof of concept, this method was applied to the detection of organic microcontaminants in different water matrices (such as tap, ground, and treated wastewater). Common contaminants (e.g., DEET, benzotriazole, beta-estradiol) were tentatively detected and, if above the LOQ, quantified (i.e., DEET at 30 pg mL(-1)). These promising results evidence that this approach is interesting for quick (field) screening methods, and the newly increased efficiency for a larger polarity range additionally expands the range of possible applications.

AB Kanamycin is an aminoglycoside antibiotic that can be useful against both gram negative and positive bacteria. However, if its serum levels are not controlled properly, it can cause serious side effects like ototoxicity and nephrotoxicity. The aim of this study was to design a simple and rapid fluorescent aptasensor for detection of kanamycin, based on Aptamer/Complementary strand (dsDNA)-capped mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs) and Rhodamine B as a fluorescent probe. The MSNs pores were filled with Rhodamine B and then gated with dsDNA. In the presence of kanamycin, the aptamer sequence was separated from its complementary strand (CS), so that, uncovered the pores and leading to leakage of Rhodamine B. Thus, a significant increase in the fluorescence intensity was observed. The relative fluorescence intensity showed a linearity range from 24.75 nM to 137.15 nM of kanamycin with a detection limit of 7.5 nM. The aptasensor also showed to be useful for detection of kanamycin in serum samples and was able to distinguish kanamycin from other antibiotics, resulting in a sensitive, rapid and inexpensive method for kanamycin detection.

AB Detecting bacterial cells at low levels is critical in public health, the food industry and first response. Current processes typically involve laborious cell lysis and genomic DNA extraction to achieve 100-1000 CFUmL(-1) levels for detecting gram-positive bacteria. As an alternative to DNA-based methods, cell wall binding domains (CBDs) derived from lysins having a modular structure with an N-terminal catalytic domain and a C-terminal CBD, can be used to detect bacterial pathogens as a result of their exceptionally specific binding to target bacteria with great avidity. We have developed a highly sensitive method for multiplex detection of whole bacterial cells using self-assembled CBD complexes. Selfassembled CBD-SA-reporter complexes were generated using streptavidin (SA), biotin-CBDs, and biotinylated reporters, such as glucose oxidase (GOx) and specific DNA sequences. The simultaneous detection of three test bacteria, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus anthracis-Sterne, and Listeria innocua cells in PBS could be accomplished with a 96-well plate-based sandwich method using CBD-SA-GOx complexcoupled spectrophotometric assay to achieve a detection limit of > 100 CFUmL(-1). To achieve greater detection sensitivity, we used CBD-SA-DNA complexes and qPCR of specific DNA barcodes selectively bound to the surface of target bacterial cells, which resulted in a detection sensitivity as low as 1-10 CFU mL(-1) without cross-reactivity. This sensitive multiplex detection of bacterial pathogens using both CBD-SA-GOx and CBD-SA-DNA complexes has the potential to be quickly combined with point-of-care compatible diagnostics for the rapid detection of pathogens in test samples.

AB Cellular electrical properties are modulated by various physical and/or chemical stresses and detection of these changes is a challenging issue. Optical tweezers (OT) and dielectrophoresis (DEP) are frequently integrated to devices dedicated to the investigation of cells properties. Here we provide a technique to detect changes in cytosol conductivity of cells by using a combination of DEP and OT. The method was exemplified for the case of cells electroporation and is based on balancing the DEP force by a controlled OT force. We observed a decrease of the DEP force in the case of electroporated cells which was correlated to a decrease of cytosol conductivity by means of Clausius- Mossotti factor modeling. For highly stressing electroporation pulses, the cytosol conductivity drops to values close to those of the cells suspending medium. These results are consistent with those reported in the literature proving the robustness of our proposed sensing method. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A highly selective fluorescent probe (SiROPS) based on Si-rhodamine (SiR) towards F- was investigated. SiROPS can realize the NIR detection of F- because of the long fluorescent wavelength (lambda(ex) = 650 nm, lambda(em) = 669 nm). The near-IR optical and the ratiometric fluorescence type signaling were realized by employing fluoride-selective cleavage of the latent thiophosphinated probe in mixed aqueous media. The cleavage of F- to the ortho positions of dimethylphosphinothionyl group in the meso aryl involves the suppression of internal rotation upon phosphorylation of a reactive phenolate and the activating rotation of o-OH, which resulting in a large fluorescence "Turn-Off" response. The detection limit of the probe to F- was 48 nM in the dynamic range of 0.5 mu M-20 mu M. In addition, the proposed probe has been used to detect F- in water samples and toothpaste samples with satisfying results. (C) 2018 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

AB A new label-free, sensitive and selective off and on signaling fluorescence platform for assay of trace levels of Zoledronic acid (ZA) drug in human biological samples based on nitrogen doped carbon dots (NCDs)-ferric ions (Fe3+) was designed. The fluorescence probe, N-CDs, was synthesized for the first time through a facile, eco-friendly and one-step hydrothermal treatment using date kernel as the precursor without any need to use chemical reagents. These CDs exhibited excellent water solubility, ionic and photo stability in various circumstances and a highly relative quantum yield of 12.5%. In the presence of Fe3+, the fluorescence intensity (FL) for N-CDs was strongly quenched due to the interaction between ferric ions and the functional groups at the N-CDs (switch off). Afterwards, by the addition of ZA, the fluorescence sensor status turned to "ON" (switch on) due to the dominance of ZA in the competition between functional groups on the surface of N-CDs and phosphate groups in ZA in the interaction with Fe3+ results in removing Fe3+ from the surface of N-CDs. Under the optimized conditions, the proposed fluorescence probe (N-CDs-Fe3+) exhibited good sensing performance for ZA assay with a linearity from 0.1 mM to 10.0 mM, a detection limit of 0.04 mM and the precision of 2.70%. The developed N-CDs-Fe3+ sensor was successfully used for the assay of ZA contents with good recoveries and selectivity in human serum samples. Meanwhile, the in vitro cytotoxic activity and cellular uptake of N-CDs were investigated on human osteosarcoma (MG-63) cell line. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Mono-dispersed polystyrene-based microspheres with diameters about 1 mm encapsulating rhodamine moieties as oxygen insensitive internal reference probes and platinum octaethylporphyrin units as oxygen sensitive probes were synthesized as new ratiometric oxygen sensors (Rhod-PtOEP-PS). The dual luminophors of rhodamines and platinum porphyrin moieties exhibited emissions maxima at 585 nm and 644 nm, respectively. The microspheres showed good oxygen sensing properties in different oxygen partial pressures (pO(2)) and dissolved oxygen (DO) concentrations. It was found the oxygen probes and reference probes in microspheres showed higher photo-stability than their corresponding free fluorophores in solution. The microspheres also showed good sensitivity for air-pressure and cellular oxygen in cell culture medium. These microspheres were used to detect DOs in a few kinds of liquids including some daily drinks and it was found the measured errors were within positive/negative 11% as compared with the measured results using traditional oxygen electrodes.

AB A new laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry imaging (LA-ICP-MSI) method has been developed to visualize latent fingerprint of suspect persons possibly related to a criminal offence committed with a gun. Metallic impurities and metallic gunshot residues (GSRs) adhered on a latent fingerprint can link biometric information and shooting. The identification and spatial distribution of characteristic gunshot-related metals (Cu, Zn, Sb, Ba, Hg, Pb) was studied in detail. Observed limits of detection for the corresponding metals were below 0.3 ng cm(-2). The distributions of the selected metals were simply transferred to images of fingerprints that can reveal a person somehow manipulating with a gun while the presence of characteristic and consistent GSR particles provided the evidence of the shooting. LA-ICP-MSI has been proved to be a unique tool in dactyloscopic identification of a suspect person from latent and commonly visualized fingerprints. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Multivariate curve resolution (MCR) methods are powerful chemometric approaches that have been significantly involved to study the complex chemical systems. The accuracy of MCR results is directly related to the applied constraints which determine the properties of the resolved profiles. Constraints have been, and still are, an active field of research in MCR studies. Different constraints have different impacts on the range of feasible solutions, so it is important to study the effect of each constraint, to examine its compliance with physico-chemical principles, and to find sufficient conditions to ensure unique solutions.
   In this study, we focus on known-value constraint and the requirements for reducing the range of feasible solutions under this constraint. In addition, several theoretical rules are presented to determine the minimum number of required known-values in order to get a unique solution. The theory of known-values was accessed using several simulated and experimental datasets. As shown previously, known-value information can be applied in quantitative analysis of first-order data. The prediction performance of MCR-ALS method under known-value constraint was compared to the results of the well stablished partial least squares (PLS) method in the presence of minimum number of required calibration samples. The comparison shows the advantage of using MCR-ALS method under known-value constraint over the PLS results in such experiments. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In the present work, bare ultra trace graphite electrode (UTGE), UTGE modified with multi-walled carbon nanotubes (UTGE-MWCNTs), and UTGE modified with graphene nanoplatelets (UTGE-GNPs) were considered as working electrodes. For the first time, the UTGEs were modified with MWCNTs and GNPs by simple and fast drop-casting approach (the whole procedures take no more times than ca. 30 min). The comprehensive microscopic and electrochemical characterization of the unmodified and the modified UTGEs was conducted by means of atomic force microscopy (AFM), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), and cyclic voltammetry (CV) techniques. The prepared electrodes were further applied for the analytical purposes, and the procedures for the square-wave voltammetric (SWV) determination of pesticide metobromuron (Mbn) using the bare UTGE, the UTGE-MWCNTs, and the UTGEe-NPs were developed. For the first time, this compound was electrochemically investigated. The SWV measurements were performed in Britton-Robinson buffer (B-R) solution at pH 2.0 as a supporting electrolyte. SWV parameters, i.e. amplitude, frequency, and step potential, were optimized. The linear relationships between peak current vs. increasing concentrations of Mbn were defined using the bare UTGE, the UTGE-MWCNTs, and the UTGE-GNPs, and the limits of detection were calculated (0.13, 0.11, 0.048 mmol L-1, respectively). The analytical parameters determined from calibration curves indicate similar sensitivity on all tested electrodes, however, the widest linearity range as well as the lowest LOD and LOQ values were achieved on the UTGE modified with GNPs. The utility of the proposed method with the UTGE-GNPs was verified by the quantitative analysis of Mbn in soil samples with satisfactory results (recovery of 99.1%). Furthermore, the impact of possible interferences was tested and evaluated, and obtained results proved good selectivity of the proposed method. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB It is known that tryptophan (Trp) tends to be electropolymerized over a potential window that is mostly applied for voltammetric determination of Trp. Furthermore, over the applied potential range, most of Trp-sensors suffer from some possible interferences. Knowing these challenges motivated us to establish a novel sensing device able to monitor Trp before approaching the mentioned potential range, decreasing memory-effects and some sources of non-linearity during electrochemical measurements. However, considering its molecular structure, it is unrealistic to expect tryptophan oxidation in negative potentials. This work reports the application of a surface-confined chromium-salen complex that delivered a redox couple attributed to Cr(II)/Cr(III) at a low positive potentials. The recorded cyclic voltammograms (CVs) clarified that Trp has a high inhibitory activity toward the chromium oxidation peak in the alkaline medium at a low potential of -0.18 V vs. Ag/AgCl. The positive shift of the anodic peak potential of redox reaction disclosed that Trp drastically influenced the capability of the interfacial charge transfer of the modified electrode, the features that was exploited in establishing a sensitive Trp detection method using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The proposed sensor was successfully employed to determine Trp over a concentration range of 4.0-60.0 nM with the calculated detection limit of 0.78 nM. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Target selectivity is one of the main challenges in the search for small molecules able to act as effective and non-toxic anticancer and/or antiviral drugs. To achieve this goal, handy, rapid and reliable High Throughput Screening methodologies are needed. We here describe a novel functionalization for the solid phase synthesis of oligonucleotides on Controlled Pore Glass, including a flexible hexaethylene glycol spacer linking the first nucleoside through the nucleobase via a covalent bond stable to the final deprotection step. This allowed us preparing fully deprotected oligonucleotides still covalently attached to their supports. In detail, on this support we performed both the on-line synthesis of different secondary structure-forming oligonucleotides and the affinity chromatography-based screenings of conformation-selective G-quadruplex ligands. By using a fluorescent core-extended naphthalene diimide with different emitting response upon binding to sequences folding into G-quadruplexes of different topologies, we have been able to discriminate not only G-quadruplex vs. duplex DNA structures, but also different G-quadruplex conformations on the glass beads by confocal microscopy.

This emphasises the need to develop methods of detecting nucleic acids, particularly in a multiplex format, that yield a decisive conclusion for clinical interpretation. Herein, we introduce a polymerase-assisted fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) assay to simultaneously analyse binary viral genes that are characteristic of hemagglutinin and neuraminidase in influenza A virus. The approach takes advantage of the formation of an X-shaped four-way DNA junction (4WJ), thus enabling a selective response to the binary targets of specific sequences. Polymerase drives the cycling of the target complex and incorporates 2'-deoxyuridine-5-triphosphate (dUTP) labelled with Texas Red (TRdUTP) into the double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) that is produced, which induces FRET to produce a sensing output. Crucially, the mechanism relies on a DNA hairpin instead of a molecular beacon, which substantially increases the simplicity of the assay and reduces its cost. The results revealed that the lowest detectable concentration was approximately 2 pM. The donor acceptor distance was approximately 7 A and independent of the ratio of TR-dUTP to 2'-deoxythymidine-5-triphosphate (dTTP). An 'offeon' assay operating in AND gate mode was demonstrated and is potentially useful for the fast diagnosis and subtyping of influenza viruses. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB 3D NiO/polyaniline p-p junction foam was prepared and applied for electrochemical detection of Cr6+. The electrochemical detection using interfacial potential barrier was illustrated and a mature theoretical model was built to demonstrate the mechanism. Electrochemical sensing signals of targets can be revealed by changing the height of potential barrier after specific adsorption. The extra high sensitivity (0.78 mu A nM(-1)) and low detection limit (3.96 x 10(-4) nM) of Cr6+ were achieved by applying the p-p junction interfacial potential barrier as driven factors. This work proposes a model to apply the potential barrier for electrochemical detection of metal ions, which can be further developed for a wide range of specific substance detection.

AB In this work, the three-dimensional nitrogen-doped nanostructured carbons with hierarchical architectures (3D-NNCsHAs) with high density of defective sites, high surface area and pluralities of pore size distributions was prepared through the pyrolysis of sea-tangle (Laminaria japonica), an inexpensive, eco-friendly and abundant precursor. Benefitting from their structural uniqueness, a selective and sensitive ascorbic acid (AA) sensor based on 3D-NNCsHAs was developed. Compared to the glassy carbon electrode (GCE) and the carbon nanotubes modified GCE (CNTs/GCE), the 3D-NNCsHAs modified GCE (3D-NNCsHAs/GCE) presents higher performance towards the electrocatalysis and detection of AA, such as lower detection limit (1 mu M), wider linear range (10-4410 mu M) and lower electrooxidation peak potential ( 0.02V vs. Ag/AgCl). In addition, 3D-NNCsHAs/GCE also exhibits high anti-interference and anti-fouling abilities for AA detection. Particularly, the fabricated 3D-NNCsHAs/GCE is able to determine AA in real samples and the results acquired are satisfactory. Therefore, the 3D-NNCsHAs can be considered as a kind of novel electrode nanomaterial for the fabrication of selective and sensitive AA sensor for the extensive practical applications ranging from food analysis, to pharmaceutical industry and clinical test.

AB Sensitive and specific detection of protein is of great significance for early diagnosis and prognosis of many diseases. However, great challenges remain unsolved including relative low sensitivity, high cost, long testing time, complicated instrument and laborious operation. To improve the performance of protein detection methods, development of fine reaction interface for recognition and signal amplification is of great importance. In this work, we construct a novel mode of DNA assembly at electrode interface based on a tripodal surface anchor and an electrochemical aptasensor for protein assay is developed. The orientation of the immobilized DNA is optimized, which promises the efficiency of protein recognition. In addition, hybridization chain reaction is employed for further signal amplification. Therefore, this detection method shows high sensitivity with excellent specificity. The strategy can be universally applicable by simply modifying the sequences of used DNA probes.

AB A cost-effective microporous polymer was synthesized using cheap monomer and catalyst via one-step Scholl-coupling reaction, and its chemical, morphological characteristics and pore structure were investigated. The as-synthesized polymer with large surface area and narrow pore distribution (centered in 1.2 nm) was prepared as a fiber coating for solid-phase microextraction (SPME). Headspace SPME was used for the extraction of the light aromatic compounds, e.g. benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, m-xylene, naphthalene and acenaphthene. The parameters influencing the extraction and desorption efficiencies, such as extraction temperature and time, salt concentration, desorption temperature and time were investigated and optimized. The results showed that the home-made fiber had superior extraction efficiencies compared with the commercial PDMS fiber. Under the optimized conditions, low detection limits (0.01-1.3 ng/L), wide linear ranges (from 50 to 20000 ng/L to 1-20000 ng/L), good repeatability (4.2-9.3%, n = 6) and reproducibility (0.30-11%, n = 3) were achieved. Moreover, the practical applicability of the coating and proposed method was evaluated by determining the target light aromatic compounds in environmental water samples with satisfied recoveries (83.2%-116%).

AB Potassium ion concentration can be successfully determined volumetrically by moving the titration from a homogeneous phase to a two phase solvent system. This is because potassium can be readily complexed in a selective and thermodynamically stable manner by ionophores such as valinomycin. Previous work demonstrated the successful titration of potassium by ion-exchange into an organic phase containing valinomycin, but the sample itself served as titrant, which is not sufficiently practical for routine applications. This problem is overcome here by a co-extraction based approach, with the sodium salt of the water soluble lipophilic anion tetraphenylborate as titrant. The extraction of potassium tetraphenylborate must be preferred over that of the hydrogen ion-tetraphenylborate pair, which is used to indicate the endpoint by the presence of a lipophilic indicator in the organic phase. This is controlled by the sample pH, which for the conditions chosen here is around 7 for optimal sharpness and accuracy of the endpoint. The approach is demonstrated in a colorimetric detection approach, by use of a tethered digital camera and subsequent automated analysis of the resulting image files. The potassium analysis in a variety of samples is successfully demonstrated, including blood serum. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In order to suppress or eliminate the spurious peaks and improve signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of Hadamard transform ion mobility spectrometry (HT-IMS), a normal-inverse bimodule operation Hadamard transform - ion mobility spectrometry (NIBOHT-IMS) technique was developed. In this novel technique, a normal and inverse pseudo random binary sequence (PRBS) was produced in sequential order by an ion gate controller and utilized to control the ion gate of IMS, and then the normal HT-IMS mobility spectrum and the inverse HT-IMS mobility spectrum were obtained. A NIBOHT-IMS mobility spectrum was gained by subtracting the inverse HT-IMS mobility spectrum from normal HT-IMS mobility spectrum. Experimental results demonstrate that the NIBOHT-IMS technique can significantly suppress or eliminate the spurious peaks, and enhance the SNR by measuring the reactant ions. Furthermore, the gas CHCl3 and CH2Br2 were measured for evaluating the capability of detecting real sample. The results show that the NIBOHT-IMS technique is able to eliminate the spurious peaks and improve the SNR notably not only for the detection of larger ion signals but also for the detection of small ion signals.

AB Data analysis represents a key challenge for untargeted metabolomics studies and it commonly requires extensive processing of more than thousands of metabolite peaks included in raw high-resolution MS data. Although a number of software packages have been developed to facilitate untargeted data processing, they have not been comprehensively scrutinized in the capability of feature detection, quantification and marker selection using a well-defined benchmark sample set. In this study, we acquired a benchmark dataset from standard mixtures consisting of 1100 compounds with specified concentration ratios including 130 compounds with significant variation of concentrations. Five software evaluated here (MS-Dial, MZmine 2, XCMS, MarkerView, and Compound Discoverer) showed similar performance in detection of true features derived from compounds in the mixtures. However, significant differences between untargeted metabolomics software were observed in relative quantification of true features in the benchmark dataset. MZmine 2 outperformed the other software in terms of quantification accuracy and it reported the most true discriminating markers together with the fewest false markers. Furthermore, we assessed selection of discriminating markers by different software using both the benchmark dataset and a real-case metabolomics dataset to propose combined usage of two software for increasing confidence of biomarker identification. Our findings from comprehensive evaluation of untargeted metabolomics software would help guide future improvements of these widely used bioinformatics tools and enable users to properly interpret their metabolomics results.

AB The presence of cancer cells in body fluids confirms the occurrence of metastasis and guides treatment. A simple, fast, and homogeneous fluorescent method was developed to detect cancer cells based on catalytic hairpin assembly (CHA) and bifunctional aptamers. The bifunctional aptamer had a recognition domain for binding to target cancer cells and an initiator domain for triggering the CHA reaction. In the presence of target cells, the bifunctional aptamer was released from the inhibitor and initiated a cascade reaction of assembly and disassembly of the hairpins. Separation of the fluorophores from the quenchers produced fluorescence signals. The proposed strategy showed high specificity for discriminating normal cells and leukocytes, and the detection limit was 10 cells/mL, which was lower than that of previous aptasensors. This assay was further tested using four kinds of clinical samples spiked with target cells to confirm its applicability. We developed a simple, rapid, and cost-effective method for the detection of cancer cells that did not require purification, and the approach holds great potential for bioanalysis and early diagnosis.

AB Background: CD38 is a surface membrane antigen highly expressed in malignant blood cells, such as multiple myeloma (MM). A soluble form of CD38 (sCD38) is also present in the plasma, deriving likely from the shedding from the cells. The plasma levels of sCD38 should thus correlate closely with the proliferation of the MM cells, allowing the development of a simple diagnostic blood test for monitoring the progress of the disease. However, the plasma sCD38 levels are extremely low, requiring the design of a highly sensitive and specific assay.
   Results: In this study, we developed an ultra-sensitive assay, based on two nanobodies (Nbs) targeting two distinct epitopes of sCD38. One Nb acts as a capturer, and the other is fused with the firefly luciferase serving as a reporter to ensure sensitivity. We showed that this Dual epitopes protein IDentification (DepID) assay has sensitivity reaching 10 pg/mL, which is 10 times higher than that of a commercial ELISA kit. By this method, we were able to precisely quantify the levels of sCD38 in the plasma of MM patients, which were significantly higher than those from healthy donors. We further showed that the increase plasma levels of sCD38 correlated with the progress of MM.
   Conclusion: We have developed a Nb-based luminescence sandwich assay, named as DepID, for quantification of the soluble CD38 in MM patients' plasma and showed the potency of this method as a tool for general diagnosis of MM or companion diagnosis of the CD38-targeted therapies.

AB Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are responsible for maintaining tumor growth, metastasis and recurrence. The high expression of cancer stem cell transcription factors (Oct4, Sox2 and Nanog) is a valuable prognostic factor, suggesting a higher risk of tumor recurrence and metastasis. So, the development of a convenient and cost-effective method for multiplex assay of these transcription factors (TFs) is highly required. In this work, we have proposed a universal homogeneous assay for multicolor detection of these TFs based on anti-dsDNA antibody-decorated Fe3O4 magnetite nanoparticles (aadMNPs). In the presence of analytes, the dye-labeled dsDNAs are bound by specific TFs, which will inhibit the interactions between the dsDNAs and aadMNPs, generating higher fluorescence that may provide signal readout for the immunosensing process. By using the proposed method, Oct4 can be determined in a linear range from 3 to 1200 ng/mL with a detection limit of 0.035 ng/mL. Furthermore, we have presented assays for the sensitive, selective and rapid detection of Oct4, Sox2 and Nanog in cell extract, as well as the analysis of binding affinity of the mutated binding sequences. This work may provide potential applications in clinical CSCs detections, and may open new opportunity for the study of nucleotide polymorphisms in TF binding sites. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB Campylobacter is the most common cause of infectious intestinal disease, with nearly all cases caused by two species: C. jejuni and C. coli. We recently reported a gold nanoparticle-based two-stage aptasensing platform, which was improved in the present study for the rapid and on-site detection of both C. jejuni and C. coli in food samples. Compared to the previous platform, the improved platform yielded a more obvious colour change from red to purple due to the aggregation of gold nanoparticles, and does not require additional time or a pH optimization step for the aptamers to be adsorbed onto the gold nanoparticles. Using a highly specific aptamer that binds to live C. jejuni and C. coli, the improved aptasensor was highly effective for testing pure culture samples. The accuracy of the newly developed platform was comparable (p = 0.688) to that of the gold-standard detection method of tazobactam-supplemented culture, whereas it was superior to the official agar-based detection method (p = 0.016) in a validation study with 50 naturally contaminated chicken carcass samples. This is the first study on a colorimetric sensor that targets both live C. coli and C. jejuni in naturally contaminated samples. In addition, we provide the first evidence that both morphological status and the amount of Campylobacter present play key roles in the effectiveness of colorimetric detection. Thus, suitable selection of an antibody or aptamer with consideration of the morphological status of pathogens in samples is essential for direct detection without enrichment. Our data suggest that the sensor developed in this study can provide an excellent screening method, with a reduction in the detection time from 48 h to 30 min after enrichment, thus saving time, labour, and cost.

AB p53 is a powerful transcription factor playing a pivotal role in the prevention of cancer development and in maintaining genome integrity. This oncosuppressor is found to be functionally inactivated by mutations in many human tumors. Accordingly, wild type p53 and its oncogenic mutants represent valuable cancer biomarkers for diagnostic and prognostic purposes. We developed a highly sensitive biosensor, based on Surface Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy, for detection of wild type p53 and of p53(R175H), which is one of the most frequent tumor-associated mutants of p53. Our approach combines the huge Raman signal enhancement, mainly arising from the plasmonic resonance effect on molecules close to gold nanoparticles, with the antigen-antibody biorecognition specificity. By following the enhanced signal of a specific Raman marker, intrinsic to the nanoparticle-antibody bioconjugation, we were able to push the antigen detection level down to the attomolar range in buffer and to the femtomolar range in spiked human serum. The method demonstrated a high reproducibility and a remarkable selectivity in discriminating between wild type p53 and p53R175H mutant, in both buffer and serum. A calibration plot was built and validated by ELISA for a reliable quantification of p53. These findings entitle our SERS-based immunosensor as a powerful and reliable tool for a non-invasive screening in human serum targeting p53 network. The approach could be easily extended to ultrasensitive detection of other markers of general interest, with feasible implementations into multiplex assays, functioning as lab-on-chip devices for several applications.

AB In this paper, a new colorimetric and ratiometric fluorescent probe for the rapid detection of phosgene is reported. This probe is based on a readily prepared and highly fluorescent iminocoumarin, which reacts rapidly with phosgene to form a cyclic carbamate product to produce, distinctive colorimetric and ratiometric fluorescent signal changes. The detection of phosgene with this probe is fast (complete within 2 min), highly selective and sensitive with a detection limit of 27 nM in solution. Moreover, this probe can be used to prepare easy-to-use paper test strips for convenient visual and fluorescent detection of phosgene gas even at a concentration of 0.1 mg/L. Overall, this work provides a very promising dual colorimetric and ratiometric fluorescent probe for rapid and sensitive detection of phosgene both in solution and in the gas phase.

AB The high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) coupled to electrospray ionization (ESI) octopole orthogonal acceleration time-of-flight (TOF) mass spectrometry (MS) was developed to separate secondary metabolites belonging to different groups of compounds with a wide range of polarity, i.e. phenolic acids, flavonoids, sesquiterpenes and others present in minute amounts, in a single run.
   Moreover, application of ESI-TOF-MS with a simple in source type of fragmentation and high mass accuracy measurements (around 2 ppm) in both positive and negative ionization modes with different and optimized fragmentor voltages, enabled the identification of each single compound based on proposed fragmentation patterns. In this way a total number of 14 compounds in methanolic and water-methanolic (1: 1, v/v) extract from fruits of Eryngium amethystinum and 6 compounds in extract from fruits of E. planum have been identified for the first time.
   Additionally, two dimensional thin layer chromatography/high performance liquid chromatography/ electrospray-ionization-time-of-flight mass spectrometry (TLC/HPLC/ESI-TOF-MS) system was developed for identification of compounds with the highest anti-radical activity revealed in TLC-DPPH bioauthographic test. This on-line procedure enables significant improvement in terms of efficiency and faster structural analysis of the potential antioxidant natural compounds directly in the plant extracts screened for bioactivity tests. This effect directed analysis (EDA) method enables separation, identification and preliminary screening of plant extracts for anti-radical properties and can be easily adopted for other bioactivities.

AB The development of portable and user-friendly sensing platforms is a hot topic in the field of analytical chemistry. Among others, electroanalytical approaches exhibit a high amenability for reaching this purpose, i.e. the commercial strips for diabetes care are an obvious success. However, providing fully-integrated and user-friendly methods is the leitmotiv. In this work we evaluate the use of a disposable pipette tip, opportunely configured, to realize the first example of lab-on-a-tip. The combination of a pipette tip, wire electrodes, and cotton wool filter, highlights the suitability of producing a novel one-shot electroanalytical platform that does not require expertise-required tasks. To demonstrate the feasibility of this novel method, copper (Cu2+) is detected in water samples by means of anodic stripping voltammetry. The quantification is performed directly into the tip that contains a cotton wool filter: the filter has the double function of purifying the matrices from gross impurities and releasing all the pre-loaded reagents necessary for the assay. After optimizing the experimental parameters, the lab-on-a-tip was capable of detecting Cu2+ linearly up to 300 mu g/L with a detection limit of 6.3 mu g/L. The effectiveness of the platform was confirmed by testing 50, 100, and 150 ppb Cu-spiked river water sample with recovery value comprised between 92 and 103%. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB Biomass fast pyrolysis oils contain molecules having a large variety of chemical functions and a wide range of molecular weights (from several tens to several thousand grams per mole). The good knowledge of their complex composition is essential for optimizing the conversion of bio-oils to biofuels, thereby requiring powerful separation techniques. In this work, we investigate the interest of centrifugal partition chromatography (CPC) as a first dimension for the analysis of a bio-oil. A CPC method is proposed to separate oxygen containing compounds according to their partition coefficients in the solvent system. This approach is a powerful and easy-to-use technique that enables fractionation of a bio-oil at a semi-preparative scale, without any sample loss related to adsorption on the stationary phase. Collected fractions are then injected in liquid chromatography as a second dimension of separation. Contour plot representations of the CPC x LC separation are established to discuss the potential of this approach. These representations can be used as a veritable fingerprint in the comparison of different samples or samples at different steps of a conversion process but also as a powerful tool to identify new compounds and describe the entire composition of the bio-oil.

AB Efficient and reliable analysis of chemical analytical data is a great challenge due to the increase in data size, variety and velocity. New methodologies, approaches and methods are being proposed not only by chemometrics but also by other data scientific communities to extract relevant information from big datasets and provide their value to different applications. Besides common goal of big data analysis, different perspectives and terms on big data are being discussed in scientific literature and public media. The aim of this comprehensive review is to present common trends in the analysis of chemical analytical data across different data scientific fields together with their data type-specific and generic challenges. Firstly, common data science terms used in different data scientific fields are summarized and discussed. Secondly, systematic methodologies to plan and run big data analysis projects are presented together with their steps. Moreover, different analysis aspects like assessing data quality, selecting data preprocessing strategies, data visualization and model validation are considered in more detail. Finally, an overview of standard and new data analysis methods is provided and their suitability for big analytical chemical datasets shortly discussed. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Atomization of SeH2 in an externally heated multiple microflame quartz tube atomizer (MMQTA) as well as planar dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) atomizer was investigated using a variety of probes. Deposits of Se on inner surfaces of the atomizers were quantified and their distribution visualized by autoradiography with Se-75 radiotracer. The gas phase fraction of Se transported beyond the confines of the atomizers was also determined. In the MMQTA, a 15% mass fraction of Se was deposited in a narrow zone at both colder ends of the optical arm (100-400 degrees C). By contrast, a 25-40% mass fraction of Se was deposited homogeneously along the entire length of the optical arm of the DBD, depending on detection technique employed. The fraction of Se transported outside the MMQTA approached 90%, whereas it was 50-70% in the DBD. The presence of H-2 was essential for atomization of selenium hydride in both atomizers. The gaseous effluent arising from the hydride generator as well as the atomizers was investigated by direct analysis in real time (DART) coupled to an Orbitrap-mass spectrometer, enabling identification of major gas phase species of Se.

AB Unsaturated lipids exhibit different physiological significances due to the different locations of the carbonecarbon double bond (C = C). Identifying lipid isomers with mass-based methods remains challenging. Xia's group has been successfully employed Paterno-Buchi (PB) reaction, a photochemical reaction with UV irradiation, coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) to identify and quantify unsaturated lipids in complex mixtures. However, the existing PB reagents possess certain demerits. In this regard, a new PB reagent that is compatible with various lipidomic analysis platforms must be screened. In this study, we comprehensively evaluated the conditions of the PB reaction and screened benzophenone as a new PB reagent. Benzophenone possesses unique advantages, such as a relative high PB yield; the PB products could be readily distinguished from the reacted lipids based on the added high molecular weight (182 Da); and the benzophenone does not affect the lipids appearance interval for reversed-phase column separation. Furthermore, we optimized the reaction conditions by using benzophenone as a PB reagent and summarized the molecular formulas of the diagnostic ions according to the fragment rules. The proposed PB method has been implemented in shotgun and LCeMS lip-idomics. To our best knowledge, this work is the first to report the integrated PB reaction with LCeMS lipidomics for identification of lipid isomers. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Water soluble CdS quantum dots (QDs) were synthesized by a simple aqueous chemical route using mercaptopropionic acid (MPA) as a stabilizer. These QDs had a fluorescence emission band maximum at 540 nm with a FWHM similar to 130 nm and a quantum yield of similar to 12%. Transmission electronic microscopy images were used to determine the QD diameter of 8.9 +/- 0.4 nm. From this value we calculated the molecular mass M-(QD) = 1.17 x 10(6) g mol(-1) and the extinction coefficient at the band edge (450 nm) epsilon(450) = 4.7 x 10(6) cm(-1) M-1, which allowed to determine the true molar concentration of 17 nM for spectroscopic measurements in solution. The fluorescence intensity of MPA-CdS QDs was quenched only in the presence of Co2+ ions, but not in the presence of thirteen other metal cations. The fluorescence quenching of MPA-CdS QDs appeared proportional to the Co2+ concentration in the range 0.04-2 mM. Based on a fluorescence peak position and a lifetime both independent from Co2+ concentration, the quenching mechanism of MPA-CdS QDs appeared static. Because the strong electronic absorption of Co2+ overlaps the emission of QDs, our results can be explained by Forster energy transfer from QD to the bound Co2+ cations. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

In this work, the DNA1 with rich G bases was firstly conjugated on the surfaces of Au NPs fixed on the hexadecyl trimethylammonium bromide (CTAB)-coated glass slide, and thrombin was captured by the DNA1. Then, the other DNA2 with rich G bases interacted with the former DNA1-thrombin complex and formed a DNA1-thrombin-DNA2 sandwich complex. The subsequently added Au NPs can be bound to the Au NP-DNA1-thrombin-DNA2 via Au-S bond to trigger the formation of Au NP oligomers, an apparent color change of the single Au NPs from green to yellow and red was observed under dark field microscopy. By measuring the intensity change of the yellow and red Au NPs, the concentration of target thrombin could be accurately quantified. As a proof of concept experiment, the formation of Au NP oligomers resulted in significantly improved sensitivity (10 fM of limit of detection and 20 fM of limit of quantity) and wider linear dynamic range of thrombin detection (20 fM-20 nM), the relative standard deviation (RSD) was less than 5.73% (n = 5). In addition, in order to validate the potential application in clinical diagnosis, the content of thrombin in a human serum samples was also quantified. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The biosynthesis of creatine (Cr) is closely related to the bioavailability of guanidinoacetate (GAA). The lack of one or the other may compromise their role in the energy transport and cell signaling. A reliable estimate of their levels in biological samples is imperative since they are important markers of many metabolic disorders. Therefore, a new LC-MS/MS method for simultaneous determination and quantification of GAA and Cr by multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode was developed based on the hydrophilic interaction chromatography (HILIC) and response surface methodology (RSM) for the optimization of chromatographic parameters. The optimized parameters ensured good separation of these similar, very polar molecules (chromatographic resolution >1.5) without prior derivatization step in a short analysis run (6 min). The developed method was validated to ensure accurate (R, 75.1-101.6%), precise (RSD <20%) and low quantification (LOQ of 0.025 mu g mL(-1) for GAA and 0.006 mu g mL(-1) for Cr) of the tested analytes and the use of matrix-matched calibration eliminated variable effects of complex matrices such as human plasma and urine. Therefore, this method can be implemented in medical laboratories as a tool for the diagnostics of creatine deficiencies and monitoring of guanidinoacetate and creatine supplementation regimes in biological samples.

AB A careful separation, identification and characterization of polymer-coated quantum dots (P-QDs) in complex media such as soil solution is the key point to understand their behaviour and to accurately predict their fate in the environment. In the present study, a synthesized CdSe/ZnS core/shell P-QDs suspension, proved to be stable for at least six months, was investigated with respect to P-QDs dimension, structure and elemental composition. Separation of P-QDs and size distribution determination were carried out by Asymmetric Flow Field-Flow Fractionation (AF4) - Multi Angle Light Scattering (MALS). AF4 and MALS were coupled to Inductively Coupled Plasma-Mass Spectrometry (ICPMS) as a selective and sensitive technique for the detection and the characterization of metallic and metalloid analytes. The exploration of element-specific data obtained by ICPMS after AF4 separation enabled the signal to be deconvoluted reliably. Thus, 3 classes of size populations were identified from the whole population of P-QDs. Additionally, a soil solution and a mix of P-QDs suspension with soil solution were characterized by the same method. This strategy enabled the P-QD population, which interacted with the soil solution, to be determined, this interaction leading either to an aggregation or dissolution of the P-QDs. Reproducibility and recovery of the size distributions and element concentrations were examined for each sample. Complementarily, Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS) and Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy (STEM) were used jointly with AF4-MALS-ICPMS in order to demonstrate all potentialities of this coupling technique.

AB Covalent organic frameworks (COFs), featuring low densities, high surface areas, and good thermal and chemical stabilities, are gradually attracting interest in the field of analytical chemistry. A type of microporous polymer network material named Schiff base network-1 (SNW-1) was introduced into a capillary column through covalent bonding. The obtained SNW-1-coated capillary column was characterized by thermogravimetric analysis, scanning electron microscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and X-ray diffraction. Then, the SNW-1-coated capillary column was successfully utilized for the open-tubular capillary electrochromatography (OT-CEC) separation of sulfonamides, cephalosporins, amino acids and parabens. The fabricated capillary column showed good separation efficiency (R-s > 1.4), stability and reproducibility (relative standard deviation (RSD) < 5.88%). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of a covalent bonding strategy to bond an SNW material to a capillary column for OT-CEC. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Rapid, sensitive, and selective detection and identification of pathogenic bacteria is required in terms of food security. In this study, exogenous VOCs liberated by Salmonella strains have been identified and quantified via head space-solid phase microextraction gas chromatography mass spectrometry (HS-SPME-GC-MS) in milk samples. The specific enzymes targeted for detection and/or differentiation of Salmonella were C8 esterase, alpha-galactosidase and pyrrolidonyl peptidase using the following enzyme substrates: 2-chlorophenyl octanoate, phenyl alpha-D-galactopyranoside and L-pyrrollidonyl fluoroanilide, respectively. Detection of the exogenous VOCs, 2-chlorophenol, phenol and 3-fluoraniline was possible with typical limits of detection of 0.014, 0.045 and 0.005 mu g/mL, respectively and correlation coefficients >0.99. The developed methodology was able to detect and identify Salmonella species within a 5 h incubation at 37 degrees C by the detection of the liberated VOCs. It was found that the milk samples tested were Salmonella free. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A highly sensitive sandwich-type magnetic immunoassay based on inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry detection in single particle mode, with ZnSe Quantum dots (QDs) serving as model tags, was proposed. The transient signals induced by the flash of ions (Zn-64(+)) in the plasma torch from the ionization of nanoparticles tagged on antibody were recorded in a single particle mode. The frequency of transient signals is directly related to the concentration of nanoparticle tags, and the concentration of nanoparticle tagged antibodies can be quantified by the frequency of transient signals. Amino-modified magnetic nanoparticles (AMNPs) were synthesized and conjugated with primary carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) antibody to extract the target biomarker. ZnSe QDs were synthesized as a probe to determine CEA by ICP-MS. A detection limit of 0.006 ng mL(-1) was obtained for CEA after immuno-reactions, and a wide linear range of 0.02-100 ng mL(-1) with the relative standard deviation (RSD) was 4.4%. The method was successfully applied to human serum samples. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this work, we presented a novel label-free biosensor for rapid detection of bleomycinsulphate (BLM). The biosensor was based on the fluorescent "turn off-on" of nitrogen-doped graphene quantum dots (N-GQDs), which was prepared in a green way from citric acid and ammonia. The richness of carboxyl groups on the N-GQDs enabled strong adsorption of ssDNA to the surface of N-GQDs through p-p stacking interactions, resulting in the effective fluorescence quenching of N-GQDs system. The ssDNA underwent an irreversible cleavage event via the oxidative effect of BLM with Fe(II) as a cofactor, thus a turn-on fluorescence signal was observed. Thereby, the concentration of BLM can be quantitatively determined in a broad range from 0.34 nmol/L to 1300 nmol/L with a detection limit of 0.34 nmol/L. The presented method was applied to the determination of BLM in human serum samples with satisfactory results. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The development of high-throughput immunochemical assays to assist on precision medicine for patients treated with coumarin oral anticoagulants (OA) is reported. The assays are able to quantitate Warfarin (W) and/or Acenocoumarol (ACL) directly in plasma samples without any previous sample pretreatment. The detectabilities (W, 3.52 +/- 2.25 nM and ACL, 1.56 +/- 0.64 nM) and the working ranges achieved (W, 1.19 +/- 0.73 to 12.05 +/- 2.99 nM and ACL 0.63 +/- 0.20 to 10.19 +/- 6.69 nM) are within the therapeutic levels usually found in patients treated with these drugs. The assays are specific with only cross-recognition of 40-NH2-ACL on the ACL ELISA, which is one of the main metabolites of this drug. Moreover, accuracy studies performed with blind spiked samples show very good correlation between the spiked and the measured concentrations. Finally, a small clinical pilot study has been performed analyzing 96 plasma samples from treated and untreated patients, showing that the assay is able to quantitate ACL.

AB We have developed a novel method to develop epoxy silica nanoparticles (EfSiNP) in a single pot. High surface coverage of epoxy functional groups between 150 and 57000 molecules per particles (similar to 10(13)-10(16) molecules/mL of 200 nm EfSiNPs) was achieved for different preparation conditions. We then created a red colored probe by conjugating Fuchsin dye to the epoxy functionalities of EfSINPs. Anti-mouse IgG was co-immobilized with Fuchsin and their ratios were optimized for achieving optimum ratios by testing those in functional assays. Dye to antibody ratios were in good negative correlation with a coefficient of -1.00 measured at a confidence level of over 99%. We employed the developed non-enzymatic colorimetric immunonanoprobe for detecting mouse IgG in a direct immunoassay format. We achieved a sensitivity of 427 pg/mL with the assay.

AB This paper describes a novel technique to quantify and identify bacterial cultures of Bacillus Subtilis (2.10 -1.30 x 10(9) CFU mL(-1)) and Escherichia Coli (1.60-1.00 x 10(9) CFU mL(-1)), in corn oil using dielectric spectroscopy at elevated frequencies of 0.0100-20.0 GHz. This technique is using the electrophysiological/biophysical differences (e.g. gram positive and gram negative) between various bacteria types, as a basis to distinguish between bacteria concentrations and bacteria types. A close-ended, coaxial probe of 20.0 mm long sample-holder was developed and used to calculate the dielectric constant from the measured S parameters of the bacterial cultures, using the Nicolson-Ross-Weir method. This technique shows a linear relationship (r(2) >= 0.999) between the dielectric constant and the cell concentration, at 16.0 GHz. The sensitivity of the technique is 0.177 x 10(9) (CFU mL(-1))(-1) for B. Subtilis (with a size of 10.0 x 1.00 mu m), 0.322 x 10(9) (CFU mL(-1))(-1) for E. Coli (with a size of 2.00 x 0.500 mu m) and 0.913 x 10(9) (CFU mL(-1))(-1) for their 1:1 mixture, while the response time is 60.0s. The dependency of dielectric constant on the bacterial cell concentration at a given frequency can be potentially exploited for measuring bacterial concentrations and biophysical differences.

AB Peptides exert essential role in physiological processes. It is yet a big challenge to finish the mapping of global peptides in complex biological systems due to the interference from the matrices. Recently, the metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have been applied in proteomics/peptidomics since the unique pore structures and versatile surface properties of MOFs. By constructing MOFs with amino acids/peptides, MOFs were endowed characteristics of these biomolecules. Based on some specific interactions, MOFs could be employed as solid adsorbents to capture peptides (such as endogenous peptides, glycopeptides, and phosphopeptides) and to selectively detect peptides, and also could be applied as matrix for peptide ionization in mass spectrometry. In addition, MOFs were developed as stationary phases (including particulate and monolith) for peptide analysis. At last, the challenges and opportunities for MOFs in proteomics/peptidomics have been proposed for the sensitive, selective, high-throughput, and in situ analysis requirements.

AB Nowadays the development of stable and highly efficient Solid-Contact Ion-Selective Electrodes (SC-ISEs) attracts much attention in the research community because of the great expansion of portable analytical devices. In this work, we present highly stable Li+ all-solid-state ISEs exploiting noble metals nanostructures as ion-to-electron transducers. The detection of lithium is essential for therapeutic drug monitoring of bipolar patients. In addition, greater environmental exposure to this ion is occurring due to the large diffusion of lithium-ion batteries. However, only a limited number of SC Li+ ISEs already exists in literature based on Conductive Polymers (CPs) and carbon nanotubes. The use of noble metals for ionto- electron transduction offers considerable advantages over CPs and carbon materials, including fast and conformal one-step deposition by electrochemical means, non-toxicity and high stability. We investigate for the first time the use of gold nanocorals obtained by means of a one-step electrodeposition process to improve sensor performance and we compare it to all-solid-state ISEs based on electrodeposited platinum nanoflowers. In addition, the effect of substrate electrode material, membrane thickness and conditioning concentration on the potentiometric response is carefully analysed. Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and Current Reversal Chronopotentiometry (CRC) techniques are used to characterize the morphology and the electrochemical behaviour of the different ISEs. The use of nanostructured gold and platinum contacts allows the increase of the SC capacitance by one or two orders of magnitude, respectively, with respect to the flat metal, while the SC resistance is significantly reduced. We show that the microfabricated sensors offer Nernstian behaviour (58.7 +/- 0.8 mV/decade) in the activity range from 10(-5) to 0.1M, with short response time (similar to 15 s) and small potential drift during CRC measurements (dE/dt = 3 x 10(-5)+/- 2 x 10(-5) V/s). The exceptional response stability is verified also when no potential is applied. The sensor shows high selectivity towards all clinically important ions, with values very similar to conventional ISEs. Furthermore, to our knowledge, the selectivity towards Ca+2 is the best ever reported for SC-ISEs. In conclusion, the present study opens up new interesting perspectives towards the development of simple and reproducible fabrication protocols to obtain high-quality and high-stability all-solid-state ISEs.

AB Cathode photoelectrochemical immunoassay usually shows better anti-interference capacity toward real samples than anode photoelectrochemical immunoassay. However, its poor photocurrent response has greatly restricted the detection sensitivity. Herein, a promising ultrasensitive cathode photoelectrochemical immunoassay was developed based on TiO2 photoanode-enhanced 3D Cu2O nanowire array (NWA) photocathode, and coupled with signal amplification by horseradish peroxidase (HRP)induced biocatalytic precipitation (BCP). Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA, Ag) was used as a detection model, TiO2 nanoparticle-modified indium tin oxide (ITO) electrode served as the photoanode, and Cu2O NWAs grown in situ on Cu mesh was both the photocathode and photoelectrochemical matrix to immobilize the capture CEA antibodies (Ab(1)). The signal CEA antibodies (Ab(2)) were labeled with HRP to form Ab(2)-HRP bioconjugates, and employed as signal amplifiers when the specific immunoreaction occurred. The developed photoanode-enhanced cathode photoelectrochemical immunoassay has good anti-interference capability, outstanding photocurrent response, and high sensitivity for target Ag detection, which was attributed to the synergistic effects of the 3D nanostructure of Cu2O NWA photocathode, the introduction of TiO2 photoanode as counter electrode, and the signal amplification of Ab(2)-HRP bioconjugate-induced BCP. The developed cathode photoelectrochemical immunoassay showed a low limit of detection (0.037 pgmL(-1)) with a wide linear range ( from 0.1 pgmL(-1) to 50 ng mL(-1)) for CEA detection.

AB Given the increased interest in public hygiene due to outbreaks of food poisoning, increased emphasis has been placed on developing novel monitoring systems for point-of-care testing (POCT) to evaluate pathogens causing foodborne illnesses. Here, we demonstrate a pathogen evaluation system utilizing simple film-based microfluidics, featuring simultaneous gene amplification, solution mixing, and electrochemical detection. To minimize and integrate the various functionalities into a single chip, patterned polyimide and polyester films were mainly used on a polycarbonate housing chip, allowing simple fabrication and alignment, in contrast to conventional polymerase chain reaction, which requires a complex biosensing system at a bench-top scale. The individual integrated sensing chip could be manually fabricated in 10 min. Using the developed film-based integrated biosensing chip, the genes from the pathogens causing foodborne illnesses were simultaneously amplified based on multiple designed microfluidic chambers and Hoechst 33258, which intercalates into double-stranded DNA, to generate the electrochemical signal. The target pathogen gene was accurately analyzed by square wave voltammetry (SWV) within the 25 s, while the gel electrophoresis required about 30 min. Based on the developed integrated biosensing chip, the 1.0 x 10(1) and 1.0 x 10(2) colony-forming unit (CFU) of Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli were sensitively detected with high reproducibility in the 25 s. On the basis of the significant features of the film-based molecular analysis platform, we expect that the developed sensor could be applied to the screening of various pathogens as a POCT device.

AB The electrokinetic behavior of molecules in nanochannels (< 100 nm in length) have generated interest due to the unique transport properties observed that are not seen in microscale channels. These nanoscale dependent transport properties include transverse electromigration arising from partial electrical double layer overlap, enhanced solute/wall interactions due to the small channel diameter, and field-dependent intermittent motion produced by surface roughness. In this study, the electrokinetic transport properties of deoxynucleotide monophosphates (dNMPs) were investigated, including the effects of electric field strength, surface effects, and composition of the carrier electrolyte (ionic concentration and pH). The dNMPs were labeled with a fluorescent reporter (ATTO 532) to allow tracking of the electrokinetic transport of the dNMPs through a thermoplastic nanochannel fabricated via nanoimprinting (110 nm x 110 nm, width x depth, and 100 mm in length). We discovered that the transport properties in plastic nanochannels of the dye-labeled dNMPs produced differences in their apparent mobilities that were not seen using microscale columns. We built histograms for each dNMP from their apparent mobilities under different operating conditions and fit the histograms to Gaussian functions from which the separation resolution could be deduced as a metric to gage the ability to identify the molecule based on their apparent mobility. We found that the resolution ranged from 0.73 to 2.13 at pH = 8.3. Changing the carrier electrolyte pH > 10 significantly improved separation resolution (0.80 -4.84) and reduced the standard deviation in the Gaussian fit to the apparent mobilities. At low buffer concentrations, decreases in separation resolution and increased standard deviations in Gaussian fits to the apparent mobilities of dNMPs were observed due to the increased thickness of the electric double layer leading to a partial parabolic flow profile. The results secured for the dNMPs in thermoplastic nanochannels revealed a high identification efficiency (> 99%) in most cases for the dNMPs due to differences in their apparent mobilities when using nanochannels, which could not be achieved using microscale columns.

AB Herein, a chemiluminescence assay with dual signal amplification has been developed based on multi-DNAzymes-functionalized gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) using in situ rolling circle amplification (RCA) for ultrasensitive detection of thrombin on microchip. In this assay, AuNPs was functionalized by aptamer and multi-RCA primer for amplification, and thrombin was sandwiched between the aptamer modified on the microchannel and the aptamer linked AuNP. The further amplification was realized by in situ RCA to expand specific oligonucleotides chains on the AuNPs and produce particular multi-DNAzymes. Enhanced chemiluminescence signal was achieved by the catalytic effect of DNAzymes in the luminol-H2O2 system. The sensitivity of detection was greatly improved by the dual amplification of multi-RCA primer modified AuNPs, and RCA. The whole strategy was applied for ultrasensitive and specific detection of thrombin. The chemiluminesce assay of thrombin performed a good linear range of 1 -25 pM and the limit of detection was as low as 0.55 pM. The successful determination of thrombin in real human serum sample indicated a great potential in clinical study. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Malachite Green (MG) is a banned pesticide for aquaculture products. As a required inspection item, its fast and accurate determination before the products' accessing market is very important. Surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) is a promising tool for MG sensing, but it requires the overcoming of several problems such as fairly poor sensitivity and reproducibility, especially laser induced chemical conversion and photo-bleaching during SERS observation. By using a graphene wrapped Ag array based flexible membrane sensor, a modified SERS strategy was proposed for the sensitive and accurate detection of MG. The graphene layer functioned as an inert protector for impeding chemical transferring of the bioproduct Leucomalachite Green (LMG) to MG during the SERS detection, and as a heat transmitter for preventing laser induced photo-bleaching, which enables the separate detection of MG and LMG in fish extracts. The combination of the Ag array and the graphene cover also produced plentiful densely and uniformly distributed hot spots, leading to analytical enhancement factor up to 3.9 x 10(8) and excellent reproducibility (relative standard deviation low to 5.8% for 70 runs). The proposed method was easily used for MG detection with limit of detection (LOD) as low as 2.7 x 10(-11) mol L-1. The flexibility of the sensor enable it have a merit for in-field fast detection of MG residues on the scale of a living fish through a surface extraction and paste transferring manner. The developed strategy was successfully applied in the analysis of real samples, showing good prospects for both the fast inspection and quantitative detection of MG. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB A hierarchical three-dimensional network of carbon nanotubes on Si pillar substrate (3DN-CNTs) was developed for the accurate detection of oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) in clinical saliva samples. The 3DN-CNTs were uniformly coated with a layer of aluminum oxides to enhance structural stability during biomarker detection. Cytokeratin-19 antigen (Cyfra 21-1) was utilized as a model biomarker of OSCC for fluorescence-based immunosensor using 3DN-CNTs (3DN-CNTs sensor). The 3DN-CNTs sensor enhances the sensitivity of Cyfra 21-1 detection by increasing the density of immobilized antibody through high surface area of 3DN-CNTs and enhancing the accessibility of biomolecules through the ordered pathway of hierarchical structure. The reliable detection limit for sensing of Cyfra 21-1 was estimated as in the level of 0.5 ng/mL and the quantitative estimation of Cyfra 21-1 was analyzed by 4parameter logistic (4-PL) model for curve-fitting analysis. Clinical applicability of 3DN-CNTs sensor was evaluated through correlation with the commercially available electrochemiluminescence (ECL) detection system in the hospital. The assay results of the two systems for clinical saliva samples showed a good linear correlation. The 3DN-CNTs sensor offers great potential for accurate diagnosis of OSCC using Cyfra 21-1 biomarker in clinical fluids. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Multifunctional nanocomposites containing intrinsic property for serving as the sensing elements as well as targeted nanoconjugates are highly preferred in various therapeutic applications. In this work, nanocomposites of graphene quantum dots (GQDs) and Fe3O4 with conjugation of lectin protein, concanavalin A, to form GQD-ConA@ Fe3O4 nanocomposites are developed for both detection of cancer cell and release of drugs to HeLa cells. The GQD-ConA@ Fe3O4 nanocomposites deposited on Pt electrode can detect cancerous HeLa cells over normal endothelial cells with a dynamic linear range of 5 x 10(2) to 1 x 10(5) cells mL(-1) with a detection limit of 273 cell mL(-1). The GQD-ConA@ Fe3O4 also can serve as nanocarriers for loading and delivering doxorubicin (Dox). The in vitro cell images show that the Dox concentration in HeLa cells is enhanced more than double in the presence of external magnetic field due to the incorporation of Fe3O4 in the nanocarrier. The cytotoxicity assay indicates that the susceptibility of cancerous HeLa cells to Dox is 13% higher than that of normal cells, confirming the selective role of ConA in nanocarriers. Results clearly indicate the GQD-ConA@ Fe3O4 nanocomposites as a promising material for cancer cell detection and targeted Dox release toward HeLa cells which can serve as the multifunctional platform for novel cancer cell diagnostic and therapeutic applications.

AB Although great advances have been achieved in synthesis of fluorescent graphitic carbon nitride quantum dots (g-C3N4-dots), it is still challenging to develop g-C3N4-dots with high fluorescence quantum yield (FLQY) and multiple sensing functionalities. Herein, the oxygen and sulfur co-doped graphitic carbon nitride quantum dots (OS-g-C3N4-dots) with high FLQY of 33.9% were firstly synthesized by a simple electrochemical "tailoring" process. It was found that OS-g-C3N4-dots could specifically bind copper ions (Cu2+) and silver ions (Ag+), accompanied with a dramatic "turn-off" fluorescence response. With the help of different masking agents, OS-g-C3N4-dots are able to selectively detect Cu2+ and Ag+. Furthermore, the generated OS-g-C3N4-dots/Ag+ displayed a "turn-on" fluorescent response specific to biothiols (HCy, Cys and GSH). Therefore, the multiple functional sensing platforms based on "ON-OFF-ON" fluorescence response of OS-g-C3N4-dots for the detection of Cu2+, Ag+ and biothiols were constructed. Under the optimal conditions, the detection limits of Cu2+, Ag+, HCy, Cys and GSH were as low as 7.0 X 10(-10) M, 2.0 X 10(-9) M, 1.0 X 10(-8) M, 1.0 X 10(-8) M and 8.4 X 10(-9) M, respectively.

AB Colorimetric biosensors for the on-site visual detection of veterinary drug residues are required for food control in developing countries and other resource-constrained areas, where sophisticated instruments may not be available. In this study, we developed a highly sensitive immunoassay for amantadine residues in poultry. By introducing a novel signal generation strategy into an indirect competitive immunoassay, a highly sensitive assay for amantadine residues in chicken was achieved for naked eye readout at the part per billion (ppb) level. Signal amplification was achieved in the designed immunoassay by combining conventional indirect competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, Fenton reactionregulated oxidation of cysteine, and gold nanoparticle aggregation. Therefore, the cascade reaction remarkably enhanced the assay sensitivity and led to a pronounced color change from red to dark purple in the solution, which could be easily distinguished with the naked eye even at approximately 1 mu g kg(-1) in poultry muscle. Moreover, the color change can be quantitatively assayed with a classic highthroughput plate reader for contaminated poultry samples. The limit of detection (LOD) was 0.51 nM (0.095 ng mL(-1)). The recovery rates for spiked chicken samples ranged from 78% to 84% with relative standard deviations <15%. Therefore, we propose that this immunoassay could be generally applicable for on-site detection in the field of food control. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Oxidized waxes possess far superior properties as compared to the alkanes they are derived from. The separation of alkane oligomers via gas chromatography (GC) becomes a challenge when polar oxygencontaining functional groups are introduced or when higher molar masses are targeted. In the present study, the separation and analysis of oligomers in oxidized and non-oxidized waxes using different liquid chromatographic techniques are investigated. Oligomers in two oxidized waxes and a non-oxidized wax from which they are derived, are separated using high-temperature solvent gradient interaction chromatography (HT-SGIC) and high-temperature two-dimensional liquid chromatography (HT-2D-LC). Evaporative light scattering detector conditions are tailored to provide the best detection with the solvent system at use. It is shown that oligomers in oxidized and non-oxidized waxes can be separated and identified using the mentioned techniques. It has been found that the ELSD detector response systematically decreases as the oxidation levels of the waxes increase. Coupling of HT-HPLC and hightemperature size exclusion chromatography (HT-SEC) in a comprehensive 2D-LC setup shows a broadening of the molar mass distributions of the lower oligomer fractions as a consequence of the modification indicating changes in the oligomer chain microstructures. A preparative fractionation technique is utilized to collect specific oligomer fractions from the bulk waxes followed by hyphenation to HT-HPLC and other techniques. HPLC is shown to provide more detailed information on the oligomer composition of waxes when coupled to a pre-fractionation technique. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Surface oxidation improves the dispersion of carbon nanotubes in aqueous solutions and plays a key role in the development of biosensors, electrochemical detectors and polymer composites. Accurate characterization of the carbon nanotube surface is important because the development of these nano-based applications depends on the degree of functionalization, in particular the amount of carboxylation. Affinity capillary electrophoresis is used to characterize the oxidation of multi-walled carbon nanotubes. A polytryptophan peptide that contains a single arginine residue (WRWWWW) serves as a receptor in affinity capillary electrophoresis to assess the degree of carboxylation. The formation of peptidenanotube receptor-ligand complex was detected with a UV absorbance detector. Apparent dissociation constants (KD) are obtained by observing the migration shift of the WRWWWW peptide through background electrolyte at increasing concentrations of multi-walled carbon nanotubes. A 20% relative standard deviation in method reproducibility and repeatability is determined with triplicate analysis within a single sample preparation and across multiple sample preparations for a commercially available carbon nanotube. Affinity capillary electrophoresis is applied to assess differences in degree of carboxylation across two manufacturers and to analyze acid treated carbon nanotubes. The results of these studies are compared to X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and zeta potential. Affinity capillary electrophoresis comparisons of carbon nanotube samples prepared by varying acid treatment time from 30 min to 3 h yielded significant differences in degree of carboxylation. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis was inconclusive due to potential acid contamination, while zeta potential showed no change based on surface charge. This work is significant to research involving carbon nanotube-based applications because it provides a new metric to rapidly characterize carbon nanotubes obtained from different vendors, or synthesized in laboratories using different procedures.

   DIAGNOSIS
AB Untargeted metabolomics study of volatile organic compounds produced by different cell cultures is a field that has gained increasing attention over the years. Solid-phase microextraction has been the sampling technique of choice for most of the applications mainly due to its simplicity to implement. However, a careful optimization of the analytical conditions is necessary to obtain the best performances, which are highly matrix-dependent. In this work, five different solid-phase microextraction fibers were compared for the analysis of the volatiles produced by cell culture infected with the human respiratory syncytial virus. A central composite design was applied to determine the best time-temperature combination to maximize the extraction efficiency and the salting-out effect was evaluated as well. The linearity of the optimized method, along with limits of detection and quantification and repeatability was assessed. Finally, the effect of i) different normalization techniques (i.e. z-score and probabilistic quotient normalization), ii) data transformation (i.e. in logarithmic scale), and iii) different feature selection algorithms (i.e. Fisher ratio and random forest) on the capability of discriminating between infected and not-infected cell culture was evaluated.

AB Monitoring pH within microbial reactors has become an important requirement across a host of applications ranging from the production of functional foods (probiotics) to biofuel cell systems. An inexpensive and scalable composite sensor capable of monitoring the pH within the demanding environments posed by microbial reactors has been developed. A custom designed flavin derivative bearing an electropolymerisable phenol monomer was used to create a redox film sensitive to pH but free from the interferences that can impede conventional pH systems. The film was integrated within a composite carbon-fibre-polymer laminate and was shown to exhibit Nernstian behaviour (55 mV/pH) with minimal drift and robust enough to operate within batch reactors.

AB Infrared (IR) laser ablation at 3 mm wavelength was used to extract enzymes from tissue and quantitatively determine their activity. Experiments were conducted with trypsin, which was ablated, captured and then used to digest bovine serum albumin (BSA). BSA digests were evaluated using matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI) mass spectrometry (MS) and sequence coverage of 59% was achieved. Quantification was performed using trypsin and catalase standards and rat brain tissue by fluorescence spectroscopy. Both enzymes were reproducibly transferred with an efficiency of 75 +/- 8% at laser fluences between 10 and 30 kJ/m(2). Trypsin retained 37 +/- 2% of its activity and catalase retained 50 +/- 7%. The activity of catalase from tissue was tested using three consecutive 50 mm thick rat brain sections. Two 4mm(2) regions were ablated and captured from the cortex and cerebellum regions. The absolute catalase concentration in the two regions was consistent with previously published data, demonstrating transfer of intact enzymes from tissue. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Halogen bonding (XB), a highly energetic and directional interaction, is here proposed as a new mechanism to increase solute solubilisation in solvent extractions. The approach is illustrated by the extraction of hexabromocyclododecane (HBCD) enantiomers in soils and sediments using supramolecular solvents (SUPRAS) containing XB donors in their structure. SUPRAS consisting of inverted hexagonal aggregates of decanoic acid, synthesized by water-induced coacervation of the amphiphile in tetrahydrofuran (THF), were explored for this purpose. Sample treatment involved the extraction of 400mg of soil or sediment with 250 mL of SUPRAS for 5 min and then centrifugation for 10 min. SUPRAS extracts were directly analyzed by chiral liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) and quantification was carried out using isotopically labelled internal standards. Quantitative recoveries (93-102%) were obtained for the six HBCD enantiomers in both fresh and aged spiked samples. The mild experimental conditions required for extraction (room temperature and atmospheric pressure), the low SUPRAS volume/sample amount ratio needed (0.6 mL g(-1)), the short time required for sample treatment (15 min), and the simplicity of the procedure (use of conventional equipment and the possibility of treating several samples simultaneously), makes this method clearly superior to those previously reported. Method quantitation limits were in the intervals 0.58-2.23 ng g(-1), and the relative standard deviations (n = 18, HBCD stereoisomer concentration = 50 ng g(-1)) obtained under repeatability and reproducibility conditions varied within the ranges 1.0-4% and 2.5-5%, respectively. The approach here described could be easily extended to the extraction of brominated flame retardants in different types of matrices. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Transglutaminase 2 (TGase2), a multifunctional enzyme exhibiting both transamidase and kinase activity, is involved in a variety of cellular processes and diseases. However, details of the regulation of TGase2 have not been reported due to the lack of a suitable assay to examine both activities on the same platform under near-physiologic conditions. Thus, we developed an on-chip dual enzyme activity assay for TGase2 to simultaneously monitor the transamidase and kinase activities. Reaction mixtures specific for each enzyme activity were applied onto osteopontin arrays, and enzyme activity was monitored by sequential probing with Cy5-strepavidin and Pro-Q Diamond stain. This approach was used to determine the optimal concentrations of ATP, Mg2+, and Ca2+ for dual-activity assays. The optimized assay was then used to investigate regulation of TGase2 transamidase and kinase activities by various cofactors that could potentially affect its conformation. Monothiol-and disulfide-containing compounds differentially regulated TGase2 transamidase and kinase activities. Acetylation of TGase2 activated the kinase activity but had no effect on the transamidase activity. Phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of TGase2 reciprocally regulated the transamidase and kinase activities. The new approach described here is thus useful for screening potential regulators of TGase2 transamidase and kinase and investigating the pathogenesis of TGase2-associated diseases.

AB The present study represents fabrication of nonstructural antibody (NS1) based immunosensor coupled with bovine serum albumin (BSA) modified screen printed carbon electrodes (SPCE) as transducing substrate for the early diagnosis of dengue virus. The anti-NS1 monoclonal antibody was immobilized on electro grafted BSA surface of working electrode. The electrons transfer resistance before and after NS1 attachment was monitored as a function of its concentration to perform the qualitative and quantitative analysis. The as prepared impedimetric immunosensor successfully detected the dengue virus protein with enhanced limit of detection (0.3 ng/mL) and linear range (1-200 ng/mL). The selectivity of the designed device was further elaborated with several interfering analytes and was finally demonstrated with human serum samples. The extravagant selectivity, sensitivity and easier fabrication protocol corroborate the potential applications of such immunosensor for practical diagnosis of dengue virus. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB Ion mobility spectrometry (IMS) is a rapid and high sensitive technique widely used in security and forensic areas. However, a lack of selectivity is usually observed in the analysis of complex samples due to the scarce resolution of the technique. The literature concerning the use of conventional and novel smart materials in the pretreatment and preconcentration of samples previous to IMS determinations has been critically reviewed. The most relevant strategies to enhance selectivity and sensitivity of IMS determinations have been widely discussed, based in the use of smart materials, as immunosorbents, aptamers, molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs), ionic liquids (ILs) and nanomaterial. The observed trend is focused on the development of IMS analytical methods in combination of selective sample treatments in order to achieve quick, reliable, sensitive, and selective methods for the analysis of complex samples such as biological fluids, food, or environmental samples.

AB Ultra performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS) is increasingly being used for untargeted metabolomics in biomedical research. Complex matrices and a large number of samples per analytical batch lead to gradual changes in the instrumental response (i.e. within-batch effects) that reduce the repeatability and reproducibility and limit the power to detect biological responses. A strategy for within-batch effect correction based on the use of quality control (QC) samples and Support Vector Regression (QC-SVRC) with a radial basis function kernel was recently proposed. QC-SVRC requires the optimization of three hyperparameters that determine the accuracy of the within-batch effects elimination: the tolerance threshold (epsilon), the penalty term (C) and the kernel width (gamma). This work compares three widely used strategies for QC-SVRC hyperparameter optimization (grid search, random search and particle swarm optimization) using a UPLC-MS data set containing 193 urine injections as model example. Results show that QC-SVRC is robust to hyperparameter selection and that a pre-selection of C and e, followed by optimization of g is competitive in terms of accuracy, precision and number of function evaluations with full grid analysis, random search and particle swarm optimization. The QC-SVRC optimization procedure can be regarded as a useful non-parametric tool for efficiently complementing alternative approaches such as QC-robust splines correction (RSC).

AB Artificial neural network (ANN) is one of the most widely used methods to develop accurate predictive models based on artificial intelligence and machine learning. In the present study, the important practical aspects of developing a reliable ANN model e.g. appropriate assignment of the number of neurons, number of hidden layers, transfer function, training algorithm, dataset division and initialization of the network are discussed. As a case study, predictability of the flash point for a dataset of 740 organic compounds using ANNs was investigated via a total number of 484220ANNs to allow covering a wide range of parameters affecting the performance of an ANN. Among all studied parameters, the number of neurons or layers was found to be the most important parameters to develop a reliable ANN with low overfitting risk. To evaluate appropriate number of neurons and layers, a value of equal or greater than 10 for the ratio of the training samples to the ANN constants was suggested as a rule of thumb. More ever, a strategy for evaluation of the authentic performance of ANNs and deciding about the reliability of an ANN model was proposed which is applicable to other models developed by supervised learning.
   Based on the introduced considerations, an ANN model was proposed for predicting the flash point of pure organic compounds. According to the results, the new model was found to produce the lowest error compared to other available models. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Although several methods have realized the analysis of low molecular weight (LMW) compounds using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) by overcoming the problem of interference with MS signals in the low mass region derived from conventional organic matrices, this emerging field still requires strategies to address the issue of analyzing complex samples containing LMW components in addition to the LMW compounds of interest, and solve the problem of lack of universality. The present study proposes an integrated strategy that combines chemical labeling with the supramolecular chemistry of cucurbit [n] uril ( CB [n]) for the MALDI MS analysis of LMW compounds in complex samples. In this strategy, the target LMW compounds are first labeled by introducing a series of bifunctional reagents that selectively react with the target analytes and also form stable inclusion complexes with CB [n]. Then, the labeled products act as guest molecules that readily and selectively form stable inclusion complexes with CB [n]. This strategy relocates the MS signals of the LMW compounds of interest from the low mass region suffering high interference to the high mass region where interference with low mass components is absent. Experimental results demonstrate that a wide range of LMW compounds, including carboxylic acids, aldehydes, amines, thiol, and cis-diols, can be successfully detected using the proposed strategy, and the limits of detection were in the range of 0.01 e1.76 nmol/mL. In addition, the high selectivity of the labeling reagents for the target analytes in conjunction with the high selectivity of the binding between the labeled products and CB [n] ensures an absence of signal interference with the non-targeted LMW components of complex samples. Finally, the feasibility of the proposed strategy for complex sample analysis is demonstrated by the accurate and rapid quantitative analysis of aldehydes in saliva and herbal medicines. As such, this work not only provides an alternative method for the detection of various LMW compounds using MALDI MS, but also can be applied to the selective and high-throughput analysis of LMW analytes in complex samples.

AB Here, we developed a robust lipidomics workflow merging both targeted and untargeted approaches on a single liquid chromatography coupled to quadrupole-time of flight (LC-QqTOF) mass spectrometry platform with parallel reaction monitoring (PRM). PRM assays integrate both untargeted profiling from MS1 scans and targeted profiling obtained from MS/MS data. This workflow enabled the discovery of more than 2300 unidentified features and identification of more than 600 lipid species from 23 lipid classes at the level of fatty acid/long chain base/sterol composition in a barley root extracts. We detected the presence of 142 glycosyl inositol phosphorylceramides (GIPC) with HN(Ac)-HA as the core structure of the polar head, 12 cardiolipins and 17 glucuronosyl diacylglycerols (GlcADG) which have been rarely reported previously for cereal crops. Using a scheduled algorithm with up to 100 precursors multiplexed per duty cycle, the PRM assay was able to achieve a rapid profiling of 291 species based on MS/MS data by a single injection. We used this novel approach to demonstrate the applicability and efficiency of the workflow to study salt stress induced changes in the barley root lipidome. Results show that 221 targeted lipids and 888 unknown features were found to have changed significantly in response to salt stress. This combined targeted and untargeted single workflow approach provides novel applications of lipidomics addressing biological questions. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Macrophages, the important cells of immune system, have exhibited distinct gene phenotypes with diverse functions in different microenvironments. In the present study, macrophages RAW264.7 (M0 macrophages) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) plus interferon gamma (INF-g)-treatedM0 macrophages (M1 macrophages) were cultured in different lung cell-derived culture supernatants (CSs) as imitative tumor microenvironments. The lipids (mainly from cell membrane) of intact macrophages were in situ detected by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry. Approximately 300 of small molecules were observed in negative ion mode. Partial least square-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) suggested that two types of the macrophages have different membrane lipid phenotypes. Changes in the levels of phosphatidylethanolamine PE(16: 1/18: 0), PE(18: 1/ 18: 0), PE(36: 2), PE-Cer(d36:1), and PE(P-16: 0/18: 1) were closely associated with membrane phenotypes of macrophages. The heatmap also revealed that directional induction to classically activated macrophages (M1 macrophages) in vitro had greater impact on the membrane lipid phenotypes of macrophages than different lung cell-derived CSs. The results are consistent with the data obtained by biological technologies. (c) 2018 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

AB A simple and green fluorescence detection system on the basis of the quenching effect of Cu(II) ions on the graphitic carbon nitride nanosheets (g-C3N4 NS) fluorescence and recording the changes of restored fluorescence intensity upon the addition of metformin (MET) was developed for the first time. The g-C3N4 NS were produced using high-temperature polymerization of melamine followed by ultrasonication-assisted liquid exfoliation. The method exhibited excellent sensitivity and accuracy toward MET with the detection as low as 3 nM and linear calibration curve in the range of 0.01-20 mu M. In addition, this assay was successfully applied to the determination of MET concentration in human serum samples. It is robust and is suitable for fast, sensitive and cost effective measurement of MET in biological materials. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Nanofibers of alpha-Fe2O3 and gamma-Fe2O3 have been obtained after the controlled calcination of precursor nanofibers synthesized by electrospinning. alpha-Fe2O3 nanofibers showed an irregular toruloid structure due to the decomposition of poly (4-vinyl) pyridine in air while gamma-Fe2O3 nanoparticles decorated nanofibers were observed after the calcination under N-2 atmosphere. Electrochemical measurements showed that different electrochemical behaviors were observed on the glassy carbon electrodes modified by alpha-Fe2O3 and gamma-Fe2O3 nanofibers. The electrode modified by gamma-Fe2O3 nanofibers exhibited high electrocatalytic activities toward oxidation of dopamine, uric acid and ascorbic acid while alpha-Fe2O3 nanofibers cannot. Furthermore, the gamma-Fe2O3 modified electrode can realize the selective detection of biomolecules in ternary electrolyte solutions. The synthesis of nanofibers of alpha-Fe2O3 and gamma-Fe2O3 and their electrochemical sensing properties relationship have been discussed and analyzed based on the experimental results.

AB Papain-stabilized gold nanoclusters (papain@AuNCs) with a red fluorescence emission at 639 nm have been generated successfully in aqueous solution. The fluorescence of papain@AuNCs could be quenched in the addition of Cu2+. Subsequently, a unique fluorescent probe based on papain@AuNCs-Cu2+ complex has been constructed for sensitive, selective and "turn-on" detection of D-penicillamine (D-pen). The sensing probe has exhibited a remarkable fluorescence enhancement in the presence of D-pen, which can be measured ranging from 30.0 mu M to 2.0 mM (r(2) = 0.991) with the detection limit of 5.0 mu M. Furthermore, the developed assay has been utilized to explore the metabolic process of D-pen in rats after intraperitoneal injection. As far as we concerned, the present study has reported the first analytical method for sensing serum D-pen in real time by using the fluorescent papain@AuNCs-Cu2+ complex. Our strategy paves a way for digging up the biological and clinical application of the fluorescent AuNCs. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A reusable biosensor has been fabricated in this work for the assay of a alpha glucosidase activity and the inhibitor screening. In this design, the aptamer of ATP is split as split aptamer 1 (Apt 1) and split aptamer 2 (Apt 2), and Apt 2 can link gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) modified with Apt 1 and 4-aminophenyl-alpha-D-glucopyranoside (pAPG). Consequently, the functional AuNPs can be immobilized onto the surface of gold electrode, allowing for salt-induced regeneration. In the presence of alpha-glucosidase, the glycosyl of pAPG is cut off, and the electroactive phenolic hydroxyls appear to give a strong current signal. Furthermore, the biosensor can be recovered very easily by incubating it in water to dissociate the AuNPs modified with Apt 1 and pAPG. So, a new biosensor for alpha-glucosidase activity detection and inhibitor screening is developed based on enzyme-activated signal generation and recovery. The biosensor may also exhibit good sensitivity for alpha-glucosidase determination with the detection limit 0.005 U/mL and can be reused by water-washing regeneration with good repeatability. Meanwhile this biosensor can also be utilized for inhibitor screening, which may have potential for clinical applications. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Halobenzoquinones (HBQs) were reported as disinfection byproducts (DBPs) which had potential risk of bladder cancer. In this paper, a highly selective analytical method for HBQs was developed by HBQs-mediated assembly of amino acid modified Mn-doped ZnS/Quantum Dots (Mn: ZnS QDs). In the presence HBQs, a charge-transfer complex (CTC) was formed between aromatic rings of HBQs and the primary amino groups on the surface of the QDs. The formation of CTC led to the aggregation of QDs, as a result fluorescence decreasing occurred. The decrease was correlated with the concentration of HBQs. Then a fluorescence sensor array for discrimination of three kinds of HBQs including 2,6-Dichloro-1,4-benzoquinone (DCBQ), 2,6-Dibromo-1,4-benzoquinone (DBBQ) and 2,3,6-trichloro-1,4-benzoquinone (TCBQ) was developed. Four kinds of amino acids including cysteine, threonine, tyrosine and tryptophan were embellished on the Mn: ZnS QDs. The different extents of aggregation led to different fluorescence decreasing effect, thus distinct fluorescence patterns were created. It showed that three kinds of HBQs could be discriminated successfully by fluorescence sensor array at a range of concentrations through principal component analysis (PCA). The unknown samples were predicted by with a stepwise linear discriminant analysis (SLDA) using Mahalanobis distance as a selection criterion with accuracy of 100%. Remarkably, the practicability of the proposed sensor array was further validated by identification of three kinds of HBQs at different concentrations in real drinking water samples. Compared to LC/MS/MS, this fluorescent sensor array-based method was proved to be more convenient since the nanoparticles can be prepared flexibly according to the property of the target.

AB An automatic flow-through dynamic extraction method is proposed for the first time for in vitro exploration, with high temporal resolution, of the transit of the chyme from the gastric to the duodenal compartment using the Versantvoort's fed-state physiologically relevant extraction test. The flow manifold was coupled on-line to an inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer (ICP OES) for real- time elucidation of the bioaccessible elemental fraction of micronutrients (viz., Cu, Fe and Mn) in food commodities across the gastrointestinal tract. The simulated intestinal and bile biofluid (added to the gastric phase) was successively pumped at 1.0mLmin(-1) through a large-bore column (maintained at 37.0 +/- 2.0 degrees C) initially loaded with a weighed amount of linseed (250 mg) using a PVDF filter membrane (5.0 mm pore size) for retaining of the solid sample and in-line filtration of the extracts. The lack of bias (trueness) of the on-line gastrointestinal extraction method coupled to ICP OES was confirmed using mass balance validation following microwave assisted digestion of the residual (non-bioaccessible) elemental fraction. Mass balance validation yielded absolute recoveries spanning from 79 to 121% for the overall analytes and samples. On-line dynamic extraction was critically appraised against batch counterparts for both gastric and gastrointestinal compartments. Due to the lack of consensus in the literature regarding the agitation method for batch oral bioaccessibility testing, several extraction approaches (viz., magnetic stirring, end-over-end rotation and orbital shaking) were evaluated. Improved gastric extractability of Fe along with bioaccessible data comparable to the dynamic counterpart based on the continuous displacement of the extraction equilibrium was obtained with batchwise magnetic stirring, which is deemed most appropriate for ascertaining worst-case/maximum bioaccessibility scenarios.

AB Dengue virus type 2 NS1 (DENV2 NS1) is a specific and sensitive protein biomarker for dengue fever diagnosis. In this study we used polyvalent phage display to identify unique affinity peptides that can bind NS1 protein. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) were used to investigate the binding interactions. The potential affinity peptide-displayed phage from these methods was selected; its sequence was EHDRMHAYYLTR (R3#10). Amino acid sequence analysis showed that the peptide was rich in basic residues (two His and Arg). Among all the peptides tested, R3#10 showed the greatest decrease in current in CV and increase in impedance in EIS upon binding to NS1 proteins. EIS revealed that R3#10 phage clones were more specific towards NS1 proteins, as compared to bovine serum albumin or the M13 wild type used as control. Detection of NS1 proteins is in accordance with the electron-transfer resistance (Rct) value of the sensor layer, which is confirmed by EIS, and the Kd value of the R3# 10 peptide while binding to the phage particles was measured. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first example of identification and characterization of NS1 binding affinity peptides using phage display technology and electrochemical methods. We concluded that these new peptide-displayed phages or free peptides from phages may have potential applications in dengue diagnosis. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Gas chromatography ( GC) methods for the determination of inorganic anions and structurally related compounds are reviewed. In their native form, such analytes are polar and non-volatile, therefore they require derivatization before GC analysis. Several chemistries have been employed to convert anions to volatile molecules with applications to a wide set of analytes: nitrite, nitrate, halides, azide, bromate, iodate, borate, carbonate, thiocyanate, cyanide, sulfide, silicates, phosphates, phosphonates, selenite, selenate, arsenite, arsenate, monomethylarsonic acid, and dimethylarsinic acid have been measured following GC separation.
   In this review, most derivatization chemistries employed for anions are discussed with attention to molecular aspects of the conversion, experimental conditions, applications to complex sample matrices, and figure of merits.

AB The wide spread of infectious diseases have provoked the scientists to develop new types of vaccines. Among the different types of vaccines, the recently discovered plasmid DNA vaccines, have gained tremendous attentions in the last few decades as a modern approach of vaccination. The scientific interest in plasmid DNA vaccines is attributed to their prominent efficacy as they trigger not only the cellular immune response but also the humoral immune responses. Moreover, pDNA vaccines are easily to be stored, shipped and produced. However, the purification of the pDNA vaccines is a crucial step in their production and administration, which is usually conducted by different chromatographic techniques. This review summarizes the most recent chromatographic purification methods provided in the literature during the last five years following our last review in 2013, including affinity chromatography, hydrophobic interaction chromatography, ion exchange chromatography, multimodal chromatography, sample displacement chromatography and miscellaneous chromatographic methods.

AB A gold particle deposited glassy carbon electrode (Au/GCE) was first used in electrochemical vapor generation (ECVG) technology and demonstrated to have excellent catalytic property for the electrochemical conversion process of aqueous mercury, especially for methylmercury (CH3Hg+), to gaseous mercury. Systematical research has shown that the highly consistent or distinct difference between the atomic fluorescence spectroscopy signals of CH3Hg+ and Hg2+ can be achieved by controlling the electrolytic parameters of ECVG. Hereby, a new green and accurate method for mercury speciation analysis based on the distinguishing electrochemical reaction behavior of Hg2+ and CH3Hg+ on the modified electrode was firstly established. Furthermore, electrochemical impedance spectra and the square wave voltammetry displayed that the ECVG reaction of CH3Hg+ may belong to the electrocatalytic mechanism. Under the selected conditions, the limits of detection of Hg2+ and CH3Hg+ are 5.3 ng L-1 and 4.4 ng L-1 for liquid samples and 0.53 pg mg(-1) and 0.44 pg mg(-1) for solid samples, respectively. The precision of the 5 measurements is less than 6% within the concentration of Hg2+ and CH3Hg+ ranging from 0.2 to 15.0 mg L-1. The accuracy and practicability of the proposed method was verified by analyzing the mercury content in the certified reference material and several fish as well as water samples.

AB Untargeted liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (LC-MS) analysis generates massive amounts of information-rich mass data which presents storage and processing challenges. In this work, the validation of a recently proposed procedure for LC-MS data compression and processing is presented, using as example the analysis of lipid mixtures. This method consists of a preliminary selection of the Regions of Interest of the LC-MS data (MSROI) coupled to their throughout chemometric analysis by the Multivariate Curve Resolution Alternating Least Squares method (MCR-ALS). The proposed data selection procedure is based on the search of the most significant mass traces regions with high mass densities. This allows for a drastic reduction of the MS data size and of the computer storage requirements, without any significant loss neither of spectral resolution nor of accuracy on m/z measures. The combination of the MSROI data compression and MCR-ALS data analysis procedures in the new ROIMCR procedure has the main advantage of not requiring neither the chromatographic peak alignment nor the chromatographic peak shape modelling used in many other procedures as a pre-treatment step of the data analysis. The proposed ROIMCR procedure is tested in the analysis of the LC-MS experimental data coming from different lipid mixtures and of a melanoma cell line culture sample with satisfactory results. The proposed strategy is shown to be a general, fast, reliable and easy to use method for general untargeted LC-MS metabolic and lipidomic data analysis type of studies.

AB Herein, we established a novel ultrasensitive photoelectrochemical biosensor for detecting urokinase-type plasminogen activator (u-PA), based on a g-C3N4/CdS nanocomposite. The prepared nanocomposite was characterized by transmission electron microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, ultravioletevisible absorption spectroscopy, and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, thus indicating that the nanocomposite was prepared successfully. In the typical process, the prepared nanocomposite was deposited on the surface of a bare FTO electrode. After being air-dried, the g-C3N4/CdS nanocomposite modified electrode was successively incubated with antibody against urokinase-type plasminogen activator and the blocking agent BSA to produce a photoelectrochemical biosensor for u-PA. In the presence of target u-PA antigen, the photocurrent response of the prepared biosensor electrode decreased significantly. The proposed novel photoelectrochemical biosensor exhibited good sensitivity, specificity, and reproducibility for u-PA detection, and a low detection limit of 33 fg mL(-1), ranging from 1 mu g mL(-1)-0.1 pg mL(-1).

AB Drug susceptibility testing (DST) for Mycobacterium tuberculosis currently faces multiple challenges, including lengthy ineffective standard methods, the expensive cost of molecular tests, and large bulky diagnostic machines. In this work, a disposable MPT64 sensor was developed to rapidly determine drug susceptibility (DS-TB) and multidrug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) using an electrochemical sandwich-immunosensor for the detection of MPT64 as an indicator of Mycobacterium tuberculosis growth. Anti-MPT64 (as capture antibody; cAb) was immobilised on screen printed carbon electrodes to specifically bind with MPT64 target protein. A reporter probe of anti-MPT64 conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (HRP labeled rAb) then completed the sandwich immunocomplex. The current signals were received from the catalytic reaction between 3,30-5,50-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB), H2O2 and HRP labeled rAb using the chronoamperometric mode on a portable potentiostat. Increasing MPT64 concentration was taken as an indicator of growth, which was measured by the disposable MPT64 sensor. This sensor shows the possibility of determining DST by comparing the signals of DS-TB and MDR-TB growth in drug-free and drug-containing liquid medium. The time required to identify DS-TB and MDR-TB in pure culture MTB and leftover sputum sediments from patients are 3 days and 4-6 days, respectively. Therefore, using this sensor is significantly rapid and inexpensive and has the potential to be used for drug susceptibility testing of tuberculosis in middle to low income countries.

AB Preparation of stir bar extraction (SBSE) device with high physical and chemical stability is important and challenging by date. A novel poly (ether ether ketone) (PEEK) tube with excellent mechanical property and chemical stability was firstly used as jacket of metal bar for preparation of stir bar. By employing covalent modification method, the inherent chemical resistant problem of PEEK which restricts the modification of sorbents was well solved. After functionalization, plenty of benzoic acid groups were formed onto the PEEK jacket. Metal organic frameworks of aluminium-based Materials of Institute Lavoisier-68 (MIL-68) was in situ immobilized onto the PEEK surface (MIL-68@PEEK) by the bonding with benzoic acid groups. Afterwards, a facile dumbbell-shaped structure was designed for reducing the friction between sorbents and bottom of container. Due to superior property of the PEEK jacket and the covalent modification method, the MIL-68 modified PEEK jacket SBSE device showed good robustness. After coupling with HPLC-MS/MS, the MIL-68@PEEK-based SBSE device was used to analyse of three parabens including methyl paraben, ethyl paraben and propyl paraben. The method had low limit detection up to 1 pgmL(-1) with good linearity (R-2 >= 0.9978) and good reproducibility (relative standard deviation <= 9.74%). The method has been applied to the detection of parabens in cosmetics and rabbit plasma after painted with cosmetics with recoveries between 73.25% and 104.23%. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB Metabolome, the ultimate functional product of the genome, can be studied through identification and quantification of small molecules. The global metabolome influences the individual phenotype through clinical and environmental interventions. Metabolomics has become an integral part of clinical research and allowed for another dimension of better understanding of disease pathophysiology and mechanism. More than 95% of the clinical biochemistry laboratory routine workload is based on small molecular identification, which can potentially be analyzed through metabolomics. However, multiple challenges in clinical metabolomics impact the entire workflow and data quality, thus the biological interpretation needs to be standardized for a reproducible outcome. Herein, we introduce the establishment of a comprehensive targeted metabolomics method for a panel of 220 clinically relevant metabolites using Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) standardized for clinical research. The sensitivity, reproducibility and molecular stability of each targeted metabolite (amino acids, organic acids, acylcarnitines, sugars, bile acids, neurotransmitters, polyamines, and hormones) were assessed under multiple experimental conditions. The metabolic tissue distribution was determined in various rat organs. Furthermore, the method was validated in dry blood spot (DBS) samples collected from patients known to have various inborn errors of metabolism (IEMs). Using this approach, our panel appears to be sensitive and robust as it demonstrated differential and unique metabolic profiles in various rat tissues. Also, as a prospective screening method, this panel of diverse metabolites has the ability to identify patients with a wide range of IEMs who otherwise may need multiple, time-consuming and expensive biochemical assays causing a delay in clinical management.

AB In this work, glassy carbon electrode (GCE) surface was modified by drop-coating graphene oxide (GO) and nile blue (NB) to form GO/NB/GCE. By using a one-step coreduction treatment under cyclic voltammetry (CV) scanning, gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) were electrodeposited onto GO/NB/GCE surface, simultaneously generating reduced GO (rGO). AuNPs from the prepared rGO/NB/AuNPs/GCE was combined with 5'-SH-terminated aptamer of dopamine (DA) via Au-S coupling to fabricate aptamer-rGO/NB/ AuNPs/GCE system. DA specifically combined with its aptamer modified on rGO/NB/AuNPs/GCE surface. CV, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, square wave voltammetry responses of this system as the working electrode were measured. With the addition of DA, the peak current intensities located at -0.45 V (I-NB) and 0.15 V (I-DA) showed gradually decreased and increased changes, respectively. There was a good linear (R-2 = 0.9922) relationship between lg(I-DA/I-NB) and the logarithm of DA concentration (lgC(DA)) in the C-DA range from 10 nM to 0.2 mM, showing a low detection limit of 1 nM. This system as a novel, sensitive and label-free aptasensor was used for ratiometric electrochemical sensing of DA. Experimental results verified that this aptasensor possessed high stability, selectivity and sensitivity towards DA detection, over potential interferents. This aptasensor efficiently determined DA in real biological samples, together with high detection recoveries of 97.0-104.0%. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Immunochromatographic assay (ICA) is a promising technology for on-site detection. Nonetheless, the wide-scale application of ICA is hindered by several disadvantages, such as poor reproducibility, low sensitivity, and single-target detection. Thus, a novel quantum dot nanobead (QB)-based multiplexed ICA (QB-ICA) with multiple test lines was developed in this study for the simultaneous quantitative detection of aflatoxin B-1 (AFB(1)) and zearalenone (ZEN), where QBs with high luminescence were used as labels to enhance the analytical sensitivity of the ICA. Moreover, a streptavidin (SA)-biotin system, which was undisturbed by the target mycotoxins, was introduced as the signal output for the control line. Consequently, stable and reliable T/C values (ratios of signals on the test line to that of the control line) were obtained as quantitative signals. The proposed QB-ICA demonstrated high sensitivity for the simultaneous detection of AFB1 and ZEN, of which the half-maximal inhibitory concentrations reached as low as 38.98 pg mL(-1) and 1.23 ng mL(-1), respectively. At 10% competitive inhibition concentration, the limit detections (LOD) were 1.65 and 59.15 pg mL(-1) for AFB1 and ZEN, respectively. The average recoveries of the intra-and inter-assays ranged from 81.77% to 119.70% and from 94.18% to 111.4% for AFB(1) and ZEN quantification, respectively, and the variation coefficients were less than 12%, thereby indicating that the proposed method is highly accurate and robust. These findings suggest that QB-ICA using SA-biotin system as the signal output of control line is an excellent point-of-care platform for the rapid screening of mycotoxins. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB Microbiota composition and its metabolic capacity are very important for host health. Evidence suggests that gut microbiome is involved in the metabolites production by host-microbiome interaction. These metabolites can be absorbed in blood and excreted in exhaled air. Although, profiles of gut microbiota and exhaled metabolites were associated with gastrointestinal diseases, a direct link between them has not yet been investigated. The aim of the study was to investigate the relation between volatiles in breath and gut microbiome in active and quiescent Crohn's disease (CD) via a multivariate statistical approach. Canonical correlation analysis (CCA) was used to assess the relation between exhaled metabolites and faecal bacterial species.
   From 68 CD patients, 184 repeated faecal and breath samples were collected (92 active and 92 quiescent disease). The microbiota composition was assessed by the pyrosequencing of the 16 S rRNA V1-V3 gene region and breath metabolites by gas chromatography mass spectrometry.
   In active disease, CCA analysis identified 18 metabolites significantly correlated with 19 faecal bacterial taxa (R = 0.91 p-value 3.5*10-4). In quiescent disease 17 volatile metabolites were correlated with 17 bacterial taxa (R = 0.96 p-value 2.8*10-4). Nine metabolites and three bacteria taxa overlapped in active and inactive CD. This is the first study that shows a significant relation between gut microbiome and exhaled metabolites, and was found to differ between active and quiescent CD, indicating various underlying mechanisms. Unravelling this link is essential to increase our understanding on the functional effects of the microbiome and may provide new leads for microbiome-targeted intervention. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB The capabilities of Cu isotope ratio measurements are often restricted by the small volumes of sample available and/or their low Cu concentration. In this work, an analytical approach was developed for performing Cu isotopic analysis via multi-collector ICP-mass spectrometry (MC-ICP-MS) at ultra-trace level using Ga as an internal standard for mass bias correction. The minimum concentration of Cu required for accurate and precise isotope ratio measurements was established to be 20 mu g L-1 with wet plasma conditions and 5 mu g L-1 with dry plasma conditions. The use of Ga as an internal standard for mass bias correction provided several advantages compared to Ni, i.e. improved internal precision on delta Cu-65 values and lower blank levels. Ga can also be used at a 4- fold lower concentration level than Ni. However, in wet plasma conditions, the signals of (ArO2H+)-Ar-36-O-16-H-1 and (ArNO+)-Ar-40-N-15-O-16 interfered with the signals of Ga-69(+) and Ga-71(+), respectively, while in dry plasma conditions, realized by the use of a desolvation unit, Ga-69(+) suffered from spectral interference from (ArN2H+)-Ar-40-N-14-H-1. These interferences were resolved by using medium mass resolution. For validation purposes, the approach was applied to commercially available blood and serum samples. The delta Cu-65 values for the samples measured at a concentration level of 5 mu g L-1 Cu and 5 mu g L-1 Ga using dry plasma conditions were in good agreement with those obtained for isotope ratio measurements at the "standard" concentration level of 200 mu g L-1 Cu and 200 mu g L-1 Ni using wet plasma conditions. In addition, the delta Cu-65 values obtained for micro-samples of serum/blood (volume of 100 mu L) were in good agreement with the corresponding ones obtained using the "standard" volume for isotopic analysis (500 mu L).

AB The comprehensive extraction recovery assessment of organic analytes from complex samples such as oil field produced water (PW) is a challenging task. A targeted approach is usually used for recovery and determination of compounds in these types of analysis. Here we suggest a more comprehensive and less biased approach for the extraction recovery assessment of complex samples. This method combines conventional targeted analysis with a non- targeted approach to evaluate the extraction recovery of complex mixtures. Three generic extraction methods: liquid-liquid extraction (Lq), and solid phase extraction using HLB cartridges (HLB), and the combination of ENV+ and C8 (ENV) cartridges, were selected for evaluation. PW was divided into three parts: non-spiked, spiked level 1, and spiked level 2 for analysis. The spiked samples were used for targeted evaluation of extraction recoveries of 65 added target analytes comprising alkanes, phenols, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, producing absolute recoveries. The non-spiked samples were used for the non-targeted approach, which used a combination of the F-ratio method and apex detection algorithm. Targeted analysis showed that the use of ENV cartridges and the Lq method performed better than use of HLB cartridges, producing absolute recoveries of 53.1 +/- 15.2 for ENV and 46.8 +/- 13.2 for Lq versus 19.7 +/- 6.7 for HLB. These two methods appeared to produce statistically similar results for recoveries of analytes, whereas they were both different from the produced recoveries via the HLB method. The non- targeted approach captured unique features that were specific to each extraction method. This approach generated 26 unique features (mass spectral ions), which were significantly different between samples and were relevant in differentiating each extract from each method. Using a combination of these targeted and non-targeted methods we evaluated the extraction recoveries of the three extraction methods for analysis of PW. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Ultrasensitive measurements of intracellular ATP (intATP) based on the firefly luciferase reactions are frequently used to enumerate bacterial or mammalian cells. During clinical applications, extracellular ATP (extATP) should be depleted in biological samples since it interferes with intATP and affects the quantification of bacteria. The extATP can be eliminated by ATP-degrading enzymes but complete hydrolysis of extATP remains a challenge for today's commercial enzymes. The catalytic efficiency of ATP-degrading enzymes depends on enzyme characteristics, sample composition and the ability to deplete diphosphates, triphosphates and their complexes generated during the reaction. This phenomenon restricts the usage of bioluminescence-based ATP methods in clinical diagnostics. In light of this, we have developed a recombinant Shigella flexneri apyrase (RSFA) enzyme and analysed its ATP depletion potential with five commercial biochemical sources including potato apyrase, acid phosphatase, alkaline phosphatase, hexokinase and glycerol kinase. The RSFA revealed superior activity by completely eliminating the extracellular ATP and ATP-complexes, even in biological samples like urine and serum. Therefore, our results can potentially unwrap the chemical and bio-analytical applications of ATP-based bioluminescence tests to develop highly sensitive point-of-care diagnostics.

AB In this study, a novel method for the simultaneous determination and accurate quantification of abused drugs in human urine was developed. Antibody conjugated boronic acid modified magnetite nanoparticles (Fe3O4, MNPs) were prepared for the selectively purification of illicit drugs in combination with high resolution matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometer (MALDITOF MS) analysis. Illicit drugs, amphetamine (AM) and methamphetamine (MA), were used as model analytes to demonstrate the feasibility of our strategy. Boronic acid functionalized MNPs were first prepared via one-pot synthesis to simplify and improve the efficiency of a chemical reaction. Antiamphetamine antibody (anti-AM antibody) and anti-methamphetamine antibody (anti-MA antibody) was conjugated onto boronic acid modified MNPs, respectively, through the formation of boronate ester bond that could maintain the correct orientation to maximally capture their antigens. The capacity of antibody conjugation to boronic acid modified MNPs was at least 24 mu g antibody/mg MNPs. Antibodyconjugated MNPs were designed to specifically capture AM and MA in human urine samples, both of which can be directly eluted to MALDI target plate by adding MALDI CHCA matrix solution for the following MALDI-MS analysis. The linear range of detection of the proposed method were 25-400 ng/mL and 25-1000 ng/mL with coefficients of determination between 0.9923 and 0.9997 for AM and MA, respectively. The lowest detectable concentrations of AM and MA were 1.87 and 3.75 ng/mL, respectively. More importantly, the proposed method allows rapid and accurate quantification of AM and MA from three suspects' urine samples. The obtained results are consistent with traditional GC/MS analysis.

The utility of the probe lies in facilitating sensing in 80% aqueous medium with an emission close to 600 nm via an intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) mechanism. The biocompatible and cell permeable probe could readily sense Al3+ in live HeLa cells as well. The affinity of the probe for Al3+ be leveraged to specifically study DNA- Al3+ interaction in solution. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Human breath, along with urine and blood, has long been one of the three major biological media for assessing human health and environmental exposure. In fact, the detection of odor on human breath, as described by Hippocrates in 400 BC, is considered the first analytical health assessment tool. Although less common in comparison to contemporary bio-fluids analyses, breath has become an attractive diagnostic medium as sampling is non-invasive, unlimited in timing and volume, and does not require clinical personnel. Exhaled breath, exhaled breath condensate (EBC), and exhaled breath aerosol (EBA) are different types of breath matrices used to assess human health and disease state. Over the past 20 years, breath research has made many advances in assessing health state, overcoming many of its initial challenges related to sampling and analysis. The wide variety of sampling techniques and collection devices that have been developed for these media are discussed herein. The different types of sensors and mass spectrometry instruments currently available for breath analysis are evaluated as well as emerging breath research topics, such as cytokines, security and airport surveillance, cellular respiration, and canine olfaction.

AB The problem of endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs) in the environment has become a worldwide concern in recent decades. Besides their toxicological effects at low concentrations and their widespread use in industrial and household applications, these pollutants pose a risk for non-target organisms and also for public safety. Analytical methods to determine these compounds at trace levels in different matrices are urgently needed. This review critically discusses trends in analytical methods for well-known EDCs like alkylphenols and bisphenol A in solid environmental matrices, including sediment and aquatic biological samples (from 2006 to 2018). Information about extraction, clean-up and determination is covered in detail, including analytical quality parameters (QA/QC). Conventional and novel analytical techniques are compared, with their advantages and drawbacks. Ultrasound assisted extraction followed by solid phase extraction clean-up is the most widely used procedure for sediment and aquatic biological samples, although softer extraction conditions have been employed for the latter. The use of liquid chromatography followed by tandem mass spectrometry has greatly increased in the last five years. The majority of these methods have been employed for the analysis of river sediments and bivalve molluscs because of their usefulness in aquatic ecosystem (bio) monitoring programs. Green, simple, fast analytical methods are now needed to determine these compounds in complex matrices. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this tutorial, we want to demonstrate the significant potential of ion mobility spectrometry (IMS), an analytical technique for identification and quantification of gas-phase compounds, in particular combined to other useful analytical tools. Coupled to gas-chromatographic pre-separation (GC-IMS), selectivity can be improved significantly, thus enabling the analysis of complex, humid mixtures. In-line preconcentration can improve sensitivity down to the ppq(V) range. Furthermore, the use of non-radioactive ionisation sources in the near future could gain acceptance and will avoid legal restrictions. Hence, with suitable and controlled sampling, implementation of appropriate substance and pattern databases and data evaluation software, GC-IMS as rapid, selective and sensitive analytical tool has shown its high potential for many applications in process and quality control, medicine (diagnostics, medication and therapy control), biology, safety and security. In the present tutorial, we want to demonstrate this capacity on behalf of examples from the application fields mentioned above, with particular focus on controlled sampling, pre-concentration and pre-separation as well as on data treatment and interpretation.

AB In this study we designed an ultrasensitive electrochemical immunosensor for RACK 1 detection using 11-cyanoundecyltrimethoxysilane (11-CUTMS) as a immobilization matrix to immobilize biorecognition element. The used silane agent (11-CUTMS) provides a favorable platform for efficient loading of anti-RACK 1 antibody. The effective loading of the biorecognition element on the 11-CUTMS matrix was monitored by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), atomic force microscopy (AFM) images and fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) spectra. The electrochemical characterization of the immunosensor was performed by using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and cyclic voltammetry (CV) techniques. Moreover, biorecognition interaction between anti-RACK1 antibodies and RACK1 antigens was monitored by using single frequency technique (SFI). The operating conditions, calibration curves obtained during optimization of experiments and reproducibility of the proposed impedimetric RACK1 biosensor are also investigated and discussed. The electrochemical immunosensor illustrated a sensitive response to RACK 1 antigen with detection limit of 10.8 fg/mL and in the linear range of 0.036 -2.278 pg/mL (R-2 = 0.999). Owing to high specificity, good reproducibility, long stability and reusability, the fabricated immunosensor will provide a sensitive, selective approach to RACK 1 detection. Furthermore, the practical applicability in human serum samples were investigated with a satisfactory result. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this paper, H2N-Fe-MIL-88B@OMC composites were fabricated by the simple hydrothermal method through in-situ growth iron-based metal-organic frameworks (H2N-Fe-MIL-88B) on ordered mesoporous carbon (OMC). Compared with pure H2N-Fe-MIL-88B crystals, the introduction of OMC can shrink the size of H2N-Fe-MIL-88B, increase the specific surface area, decrease the electron transfer resistance and drastically improve the electrochemical performance of H2N-Fe-MIL-88B@OMC. The composite exhibits remarkable electrocatalytic activity for p-nitrotoluene (p-NT) reduction and hydrazine (N2H4) oxidation. Therefore, a novel electrochemical sensor based on H2N-Fe-MIL-88B@OMC was constructed for the efficient detection of these two environmental pollutants, respectively. Under the optimal experimental conditions, the proposed sensor displays a wide linearity range for p-NT that is composed by two line segments (20-225 mu M and 225-2600 mu M) and the limit of detection (LOD) is 8 mu M (S/N = 3). Meanwhile, the sensor also shows a linear response to N2H4 in the range of 0.006-0.061 tiM and 0.061-611.111 mu M with a high sensitivity of 20.1 mu A/mu M center dot cm(2) in low concentration range as well as a very low LOD as 5.3 nM (S/N = 3). And the response time of the sensor for N2H4 detection is about 1 s. In addition, the proposed sensor shows satisfactory electrochemical stability, reproducibility, selectivity and practicability. H2N-Fe-MIL-88B@OMC may be a splendid candidate for developing electrochemical sensors to detect environmental pollutants. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB As one of the most important post-translational modifications (PTMs) of peptidome, glycopeptidome is closely related to serious disease, especially to cancer. In order to specifically discover and analyze glycopeptidome biomarkers for clinical diagnosis of cancer on early-stage, it is crucial to develop efficient technique to analyze low-abundance of endogenous glycopeptides in biological samples. In this report, a hydrophilic probe in mesoporous pore (denoted as Fe3O4@mSiO(2)@G6P) was designed and prepared. By taking advantage of the excellent hydrophilicity and size-exclusion ability, we applied Fe3O4@mSiO(2)@G6P to capture glycopeptides from both horseradish peroxidase (HRP) and immunoglobulin (IgG) digests successfully. Moreover, a total of 39 and 25 endogenous glycopeptides were identified from healthy saliva and gastric saliva, respectively, indicating the great potential of this probe for the exploration of glycopeptidome biomarkers.

AB New chemical vapor reaction (CVR) and atomic layer deposition (ALD)-conversion methods were utilized for preparation of metal organic frameworks (MOFs) coatings of solid phase microextraction (SPME) Arrow for the first time. With simple, easy and convenient one-step reaction or conversion, four MOF coatings were made by suspend ALD iron oxide (Fe2O3) film or aluminum oxide (Al2O3) film above terephthalic acid (H2BDC) or trimesic acid (H3BTC) vapor. UIO-66 coating was made by zirconium (Zr)-BDC film in acetic acid vapor. As the first documented instance of all-gas phase synthesis of SPME Arrow coatings, preparation parameters including CVR/conversion time and temperature, acetic acid volume, and metal oxide film/metal-ligand films thickness were investigated. The optimal coatings exhibited crystalline structures, excellent uniformity, satisfactory thickness (2-7.5 mu m), and high robustness (>80 times usage). To study the practical usefulness of the coatings for the extraction, several analytes with different chemical properties were tested. The Fe-BDC coating was found to be the most selective and sensitive for the determination of benzene ring contained compounds due to its highly hydrophobic surface and unsaturated metal site. UIO-66 coating was best for small polar, aromatic, and long chain polar compounds owing to its high porosity. The usefulness of new coatings were evaluated for gas chromatography-mass spectrometer (GC-MS) determination of several analytes, present in wastewater samples at three levels of concentration, and satisfactory results were achieved.

AB In this study, we developed a novel strategy using solid-phase extraction (SPE) coupled with shotgun mass spectrometry (MS) based on trimethylsilyldiazomethane (TMSCHN2) stable-isotope derivatization for rapid profiling and accurate quantification of phospholipids (PLs) in human plasma. HybridSPE-Phospholipid (HybridSPE-PL, zirconia coated silica stationary phase) was used for sample pretreatment via the Lewis acid-base interaction between zirconia and phosphate moiety of PLs. This step allows rapid enrichment and recovery of PLs from human plasma. Afterward, PLs were derivatized with TMSCHN2, which leads to methylation of hydroxyl and amino groups in PLs and allows highly sensitive PL analysis by shotgun MS in positive ionization mode (limit of detection decreased up to 116.67 fold compared to underived PLs). We developed an accuracy quantification method for determination of PL molecular species in biological samples. Two or more PL standards were selected for each PL class and derivatized with TMSCHN2 without stable-isotope coding. They were then used as the internal standards. PLs in biological samples were isotopic derivatized via acid-catalyzed H/D exchange and methanolysis of TMSCHN2. For accurate quantification, a calibration curve for each class of PLs was typically constructed by using the internal standards to normalize the non-uniformity response caused by the differential fragmentation kinetics resulting from the distinct chemical constitution of individual PL species in the biological samples. This newly developed method was used to comprehensively analyze PL molecular species in human plasma samples. It is a promising methodology for rapid profiling and accurate quantification of complex lipid molecules in biological samples. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are a promising therapeutic option for cell-based therapy due to their immunomodulatory and regenerative properties. They can be isolated from various adult tissues, including bone marrow, fat, dental tissue, and glandular tissue. Although they share common characteristics, little is known about the biological differences between MSC populations derived from different tissues. In this study, we used MS to compare the endogenous metabolite level in the human MSCs originating from the bone marrow, adipose tissue, periodontal ligaments, and salivary glands. Using an optimized metabolomics technique, we verified that human MSCs exhibit differences in the endogenous metabolite level depending on their source material, while the multivariate analysis showed that 5 lysophosphatidylcholines and 3 lysophosphatidylethanolamines can serve as markers for the discrimination between MSC sources and may be related to differences in their differentiation capacity. These results may significantly contribute to further mechanistic studies on the MSCs and provide novel in- Salivary gland-derived stem cell sights into the properties and optimal usage of MSCs from different tissues.

AB Contrary to organic solvent-induced aggregation of Au nanoclusters (AuNCs), herein, we reported aggregation induced emission enhancement (AIEE) of AuNCs in an aqueous media through confinement of AuNCs by in situ formed Zn-MOF for detecting Zn2+, Glutathione capped AuNCs (GSH-AuNCs) was synthesized through reduction of Au3+ by glutathione. Zn2+ could significantly enhance the fluorescence of GSH-AuNCs upon addition of 2-methylimidazole, which was attributed to the formation of Zn-MOF. XRD and TEM were used to characterize the in situ formed Zn-MOF. Zn2+ induced aggregation was demonstrated by dynamic light scattering and TEM. The quantum yields (QYs) of AuNCs after aggregation induced by in situ formed Zn-MOF attained to 36.6%, which was nearly 9 times that of the sole AuNCs. On this basis, a fluorogenic sensor was reported for Zn2+ detection with a linear range from 12.3 nM to 24.6 mu M and a detection limit of 6 nM (S/N = 3). The proposed sensor was successfully applied to assay the content of zinc in human serum, milk, water, and zinc sulfate syrup oral solution samples. The novel strategy proposed in this work may open a new window of interest in an unconventional application of gold nanoclusters/MOF nanoscale platform for metal ion detection and nutritional assessment of food.

AB To achieve the dual-channel (analog and digital) encoding, microbeads assembled with quantum dots (QDs) and element coding nanoparticles (ECNPs) have been prepared. Dual-spectra, including fluorescence generated from quantum dots (QDs) and laser induced breakdown spectrum obtained from the plasma of ECNPs, including Ago, MgO and ZnO nanoparticles, has been adopted to provide more encoding amounts and more accurate dual recognition for encoded microbeads in multiplexed utilization. The experimental results demonstrate that the single microbead can be decoded in two optical channels. Multiplexed analysis and contrast adsorption experiment of anti-IgG verified the availability and specificity of dual-channel-coded microbeads in bioanalysis. In gradient detection of anti-IgG, we obtained the linear concentration response to target biomolecules from 3.125 x 10(-10) M to 1 x 10(-8) M, and the limit of detection was calculated to be 2.91 x 10(-11) M.

AB Much attention has been paid to develop optical probes for noninvasive, quantitative, in vivo monitoring of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) due to its important roles in the initiation and development of numerous diseases. Motivated to meet this need, we herein report the synthesis of a near-infrared (NIR) fluorescent probe (AB1) for (H2O2) by modulating intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) process of the dye 9H-1,3-Dichloro-7-hydroxy-9,9-dimethylacridine-2-one (DDAO). The probe AB1 exhibits both a large NIR fluorescence turn-on and a ratiometric response to (H2O2)with high sensitivity and specificity. The fluorescence response of AB1 has a good linear relationship with H2O2) over a wide concentration range from 1 mu M to 100 mu M, thus affording a detection limit of 0.42 mu M. Confocal microscopic experiments demonstrated that AB1 could ratiometrically detect exogenous and endogenous H2O2 in living cells. Moreover, owing to the NIR emission of DDAO, the probe was also utilized to image endogenous (H2O2) from the peritoneal cavity in a mouse model of lipopolysaccharide-induced acute inflammation, based on the fluorescence turn-on mode. This new probe shows great potential as a reliable chemical tool to study the development and progression of (H2O2)-associated diseases in living animals. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Hypoxia plays a crucial role in cancer progression, and it has great significance for monitoring hypoxic level in biosystems. Cancer stem cells (CSCs) represent a small population of tumour cells that regard as the key to seed tumours. The survival of CSCs depend on the tumour microenvironment, which is distinct region has the hypoxic property. Therefore, the detection of the hypoxic CSC niche plays a pivotal role in the destructing the 'soil' of CSCs, and eliminating CSCs population. Numerous one-photon excited fluorescent probes have been developed to indicate the hypoxic status in tumours through the detection of nitroreductase (NTR) level. However, the biomedical application of one-photon fluorescent probes is limited due to the poor tissue penetration. In the present work, we reported a two-photon fluorescent probe to detect the NTR in CSCs and monitor the hypoxic microenvironment in vivo. The two-photon fluorescent molecular probe with a hypoxic specific response group can be reduced by NTR under hypoxic conditions. We used the two-photon probe to detect the hypoxia status of 3D cultured-CSCs in vitro and in vivo CSCs' microenvironment in tumour. The two-photon absorption cross section extends fluorescent excitation spectra to the near infrared region, which dramatically promotes the tissue penetration for hypoxic microenvironment detection of CSC in vivo.

AB A quantitative targeted screening method for the determination of residues of a broad group of more than 250 pesticides in surface water samples was developed and validated. Substances were isolated from the sample matrix by solid-phase extraction (SPE), using hydrophilic-lipophilic balanced polymeric sorbents (HLB), and analysed by reversed-phase liquid chromatography (LC) - Orbitrap high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS). Compounds were quantified in full scan acquisition mode, while accurate data dependant MS2 analysis was simultaneously triggered for the unambiguous identification of the targeted substances.
   This analytical protocol combines simplicity and robustness, with quantitative recoveries for 215 of the pesticides, negligible matrix effects during electrospray ionisation (ESI) and limits of quantification (LOQs) below 5 ng L-1 for 204 of the analysed compounds. Method capabilities were checked at qualitative and quantitative levels, analysing a set of four river water samples from rural areas in the Southwest of England. A total of 33 different pesticides were found in these samples with MCPA present at the highest concentration, in excess of 130 ng L-1.
   Retrospective examination of the LC-HRMS chromatograms permitted the identification of an additional pesticide and a group of nine antimicrobials and veterinary drugs that were also present in the processed samples. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

We sought to develop an easy-to-use assay for the rapid detection of CALR type 1 (CALR-1) and type 2 (CALR-2) mutations in Philadelphia chromosome-negative MPN patients. Peptide nucleic acid-locked nucleic acid (PNA-LNA) clamping loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assays were established, which were integrated into a centrifugal compact disc (CD) microfluidic platform. A total of 158 clinical blood samples were tested simultaneously by this microfluidic platform and an in-house real time PCR assay. The detection performance of the LAMP arrays was validated and conflicting results were identified by Sanger sequencing. The results suggested that the LAMP methods we developed exhibited good sensitivity, specificity, and precision. By real time fluorescence assay the detection limit for CALR-1 and CALR-2 mutations could reach as low as 1% and 0.5% respectively, and 10% and 5% respectively by visual method. There were no nonspecific background amplifications among different detection systems. For the CALR-1 and CALR-2 LAMP detection systems, intra-batch CV values of 1% mutated plasmid were 10.56% and 10.51% respectively, and the inter-batch CV values were 19.55% and 18.39%, respectively. The products were all analyzed by melting curve analysis and electrophoresis followed by Sanger sequencing analysis, which were consistent with the database sequences. The microfluidic platform could complete rapid detection of CALR-1/2 mutations within 60 min. The results of clinical samples detected by our CD-like microfluidic chipLAMP assay and rtPCR assay suggested that 133 samples were CALR wild type, 15 were CALR-1 mutation type, and 9 were CALR-2 mutation type. The correlation coefficient value (Kendall's tau_b) of the two assays was 0.99. Interestingly, by the newly established detection platform, we were surprised to find that one patient of Chinese origin harbored both CALR-1 and CALR-2 mutations. This result was verified by Sanger sequencing analysis. The LAMP detection systems developed herein displayed good sensitivity, specificity, and stability. Additionally, the detection results could be directly judged by color changes of the reaction systems without any auxiliary equipment. Thus, the platform we developed has the potential of being widely used in remote and economically undeveloped areas in the future. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Near infrared emission spectroscopy (NIRES) has been investigated to yield a new analytical method for determination of CaO, SiO2, Al2O3, Fe2O3, MgO, and SO3 in Portland cement samples. The analyses were accomplished by correlation of the second derivative NIRES spectra with reference elemental analyses made by X-ray Fluorescence (XRF), using Partial Least Square (PLS) regression models. Four different types of cements (type II, III, IV and V) were included in the models. The results show RMSEP from 0.18 to 1.67% (m/m) (which represents 8.6 to 2.8% of the mean value parameters, respectively) and precision (repeatability) from 0.12 to 1.49% (m/m). The worse performance of prediction [RMSEP = 0.18% (m/m), r(2) = 0.63] was found for Fe2O3 determination due its low variability in the samples employed in the calibration and validation set, usual low content in cements, and high correlation with the weak emitting C(4)AF phase. However, the paired t-test at 95% confidence level demonstrated that the analytical results obtained by NIRES multivariate models are equivalent to measurements performed by XRF for all oxides analyzed. The cost, speed and safety aspects are improved in comparison with the XRF method. The method based on NIRES requires no sample preparation and speed up the cement analysis (6 min) about 5 times when compared with the method based on XRF presently employed by cement industries.

AB Creatine kinase, a key biomarker associated with many debilitating physiological conditions has seldom been detected in biological fluids using functionalized gold nanoparticles (GNPs). We have developed a method based on the aggregation of cysteamine (Cys) functionalized GNPs in presence of ATP for effective detection of creatine kinase (CK-MM). Positively charged Cys-GNPs (brick red color) aggregate in presence of negatively charged ATP (blue color) but the process is prevented when CK-MM is added to the solution. The analytical response to the concentration of CK-MM is linear (R-2 = 0.9850). The proposed method is selective in sensing the CK-MM for a range of 5.617 x 10(3) ng/ml, 0.5617 ng/ml. The limit of detection was found to be 0.569 ng/ml in solution and 0.553 ng/ml in human serum with high selectivity. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Migration of potentially toxic xenobiotics and their transformation products from packaging materials needs continuous monitoring efforts. This task requires utilizing both instrumental and biological methods as more and more novel materials reach market every year to serve consumers and reduce production costs. Unfortunately, these materials very often sneak past our legal regulations on their composition and emission of contaminants due to contact with the materials or products stored. For these reasons, more and more novel, holistic and multi-tier approaches must be elaborated to uncompromisingly assure safety of these materials to living creatures. In the work presented, a review of methods enabling performing studies on extraction, leaching, qualitative and quantitative determination of xenobiotics and their combined effect on certain biological endpoints is given. Additionally, a basic approach guiding end-users and scientists to elaborate such studies is presented in the form of a basic scheme, and advantages and disadvantages of these methods are summarized.

AB Histidine bound bis-cyclometalated iridium (III) complexes were found to be luminescent in previous studies. This work demonstrates that the luminophores could be excited electrochemically and the electrogenerated chemiluminescence was observed in both homogeneous solutions and on the surface of magnetic beads. The findings laid a foundation for novel ECL immunoassay methodology featuring site-specific labeling of antibodies and on-site formation of signal-generating units. Taking use of the findings and the unique advantages of the site-specific labeling approach, a sandwich immunoassay for a clinically important biomarker was conceptually proved. The limit of detection of <1 ng/mL procalcitonin in human plasma could be achieved from the unoptimized assay. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A vortex-assisted membrane extraction (VA-ME) method based on several metal-organic framework mixed-matrix membranes (MOF-MMMs) was firstly developed and applied for the analysis of four estrogens in human urine. The MOF-MMMs, with high MOF loading (similar to 67 wt%), were prepared using a facile approach by embedding the MOFs in a polyvinylidene difluoride matrix. The method was suitable for a wide variety of MOF materials, and the incorporated MOFs retained their unique properties. Being model analytes, the estrogens became adsorbed on the MOFs in the vortex-stirred sample solutions and were subsequently desorbed in methanol and analyzed using high-performance liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection. The performance and durability of MIL-53(A1)-MMM was particularly noteworthy and was therefore selected to extract estrone, 17 beta-estradiol, estriol, and ethinylestradiol from the urine of children and postmenopausal women. Various extraction conditions were optimized, and the analytical method showed good linearity in the range of 0.02-200 ng mL(-1), recoveries ranging from 80.4% to 102.7% (RSD <= 11.4%), and low limits of detection (0.005-1 ng mL(-1)). VA-ME is a simple, accurate, and cost-effective pretreatment method, and its advantages such as good adsorption performance, simple operation, and straightforward removal and separation from solution highlight its broad utility for aqueous sample pretreatment.

AB Three different approaches has been used to obtain nano/micro fibers and their diversity and extraction properties were examined. The effect of their structure on stability in an ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC) system during on-line SPE procedure was monitored. Five types of various nano/micro fiber polymers were used as sorbents: polyamide 6 nanofibers, polyvinylidene difluoride nanofibers, polyethylene microfibers, and two new polycaprolactone microfiber/nanofiber and polycaprolactone microfibers/polyvinylidene difluoride nanofibers composite polymers. The fiber polymers were filled in a cartridge directly connected to the UHPLC system and tested. For each polymer, the optimal conditions of the on-line extraction were found and potential applicability on real samples was tested. The determination of ochratoxin A (OTA) in beer matrix was chosen as a case study. Relevant factors such as the mechanical and chemical stability of the nano/microfibers, filling the cartridges, fiber reusability and the possibility and the repeatability of all processes were involved in the proposed study. A new nano/micro composite sorbent consisting of polycaprolactone microfibers/polyvinylidene difluoride nanofibers was chosen as the most suitable sorbent for the on-line extraction of OTA from a beer matrix. The tested validation parameters had the value of intra-day precision lower than 1.48%, linearity in the range from 0.5 to 100 mu g L-1 with r(2) >= 0.9999 for standard and matrix calibration curve, and recovery in the range 99.1-103.9% at five concentration levels. Long-term precision evaluated for 31 analyses over the period of three months did not exceed 2.9% RSD. It confirmed the column reusability and perfect stability of nano/micro composite sorbent in the presence of organic solvents and after repeated injection of a complex beer matrix.

AB Thread spray ambient ionization uses single threads as a medium for sampling and ionization. This approach was demonstrated through the detection of various capsaicinoids from the interior of pepper fruits without destruction of the sample. Pepper residues present on the thread were analyzed by the application of DC voltage and solvent to cause field-induced charged droplet generation. Capsaicinoids extracted from the sample are contained in the electrosprayed droplets and transported to the mass spectrometer for characterization. The thread spray mass spectrometry method was optimized using commercially available materials like 100% cotton, cotto:polyester (35/65), 100% polyester, and nylon fabrics and subsequently applied for in-situ analysis of six different pepper fruits and pepper spray residues on fabrics. The results indicated that the special physico-chemical characteristics of threads allowed a rapid and convenient sampling and ionization of pepper products for analysis by mass spectrometry. The total capsaicinoid ion yields for the various pepper products correlated very well with that reported in Scoville Heat Units, suggesting that quantitative assessment of pungency levels may be achieved via the direct sample analysis without prior separation.

AB Guanosine 3'-diphosphate-5'-di(tri)phosphate (ppGpp) plays a crucial role in the gene expression, metabolism, growth, and other significant processes of microorganisms. In this work, a facile sensitive and visual strategy for the detection of ppGpp has been established by developing a colorimetric probe of copper ions (Cu2+)-mediated 4-mercaptobenzoic acid (4-MBA) modified gold nanoparticles (AuNPs). The sensing process was characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), zeta potential, dynamic light scattering (DLS) and UV-vis spectroscopy. The strategy not only achieves desirable performance over a wide concentration range (0.05-10 mu M), but also exhibits excellent selectivity over other nucleotides and biomolecules. In addition, the results could be visualized by the naked eye. We have demonstrated the determination of ppGpp in Bacillus subtilis lysate samples. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB New glutamic acid (Glu) and polyethylenimine (PE) functionalized ultra-stable gold nanoparticles (PE-Glu-AuNPs) were developed via a simple NaBH4 reduction method. The low toxicity and biocompatibility of PE-Glu-AuNPs were confirmed via an MTT assay in Raw 264.7 cells. Excitingly, PE-Glu-AuNPs were found to be extremely stable at room temperature up to six months and were utilized in an effective colorimetric naked eye assay of clenbuterol (CLB) and ractopamine (RCT) at pH 5. It was found that the selective assay of CLB and RCT is not affected by any other interferences (such as alanine, phenylalanine, NaCl, CaCl2, threonine, cysteine, glycine, glucose, urea and salbutamol). Furthermore, the detection of these beta-agonists can be visually accomplished through change color from wine red to purple blue. Notably, the aggregation induced detection of CLB and RCT was well confirmed through transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and dynamic light scattering (DLS) studies. DLS investigations, clearly showed, that in the presence of CLB and RCT, the initial size of PE-Glu-AuNPs (12.8 +/- 8.6 nm) was changed to 84.8 +/- 52.3 and 79.5 +/- 47.8 nm, respectively, via aggregation. Furthermore, the colorimetric assays of CLB and RCT with PE-Glu-AuNPs were effective starting from CLB and RCT concentrations of 200 nM and 400 nM, respectively, and could be visualized using the naked eyes. Remarkably, UV-vis titrations of PE-Glu-AuNPs with CLB and RCT could be used to well estimate their sub nanomolar detection limits (LODs) via standard deviation and linear fittings. The contribution of surface functional groups that support the analyte recognition was confirmed by fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) analysis. Moreover, the CLB and RCT assays with PE-Glu-AuNPs were supported by examination of human urine samples. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A new simple and efficient oligothiophene-based colorimetric and ratiometric fluorescent probe has been developed for highly sensitive and fast detection of Hg2+ in water, soil and seafood. The probe 5-(1,3-dithiolan-2-yl)-2,2':5',2''-terthiophene 3 TS can selectively detect Hg2+ via the Hg2+-promoted deprotection reaction of thioacetals, which caused a remarkable color change from colorless to yellow and a strong fluorescence enhancement with emission color varying from blue to yellow, enabling naked-eye detection of Hg2+. The probe shows high sensitivity with the detection limit down to 1.03 x 10(-8)M. Visual color changes of 3 TS were observed on filter paper and TLC testing strips when they were impregnated on testing strips and immersed in Hg2+ solution. Moreover, the probe 3 TS has been successfully used to rapidly detect trace amounts of hazardous Hg2+ ions in tap, distilled, river and lake water, cropland soil, fish, shrimp and kelp samples with acceptable results and good recoveries.

AB Carbon quantum dots (CQDs) with quantum yield of 14% were successfully synthesized via a simple, low-cost, and green hydrothermal treatment using cigarette filters as carbon source for the first time. The obtained CQDs showed a strong emission at the wavelength of 465 nm, with an optimum excitation of 365 nm.Sudan I with maximum absorption wavelength at 477 nm could selectively quench the fluorescence of CQDs. Based on this principle, a fluorescence probe was developed for Sudan I determination. Furthermore, the quenching mechanism of the CQDs was elucidated. A linear relationship was found in the range of 2.40-104.0 mu mol/L Sudan I with the detection limit (3 sigma/k) of 0.95 mu mol/L. Satisfactory results were achieved when the method was submitted to the determination of Sudan I in food samples. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this work, a highly sensitive impedimetric biosensor was developed for mercuric ion (Hg2+) detection. The biosensor design was based on Hg2+-triggered exonuclease III (Exo III) cleavage for target recycling and DNAzyme-mediated catalytic for precipitation polymerization. Hg2+ induced thymine-thymine (T-T) mismatches were used to trigger the Exo III-catalyzed target recycling and produce free single-stranded DNA (defined as M). The outputted M then assisted the in formation of a DNA network on electrode surface to efficiently immobilize the porphyrin manganese (MnTmPyP). The formed MnTMPyP-double-stranded DNA (MnTmPyP-dsDNA) complex exhibited peroxidase-like activity capable of catalyzing a 3,3-diaminobenzidine (DAB) oxidation reaction, which produced an insoluble precipitate on the electrode surface. This reaction significantly enhanced the resistance signal for the quantitative determination of Hg2+. Under optimal conditions, the impedimetric biosensor exhibited a wide dynamic working range of 0.005 nM-100 nM with a detection limit of 1.47 pM. This platform also demonstrated good reproducibility and selectivity, offering a promising avenue for the detection of other molecules. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In this study, we evaluated the efficiency of an innovative methodology, Needle Trap Microextraction (NTME), combined with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), for the establishment of the urinary volatomic biosignature from breast (BC), and colon (CC) cancer patients as well as healthy individuals (CTL). To achieve this, 40 mL of the headspace of acidified urine (4 mL, 20% NaCI, pH = 2), equilibrated at 50 degrees C during 40 min, were loaded through the DVB/Car1OOO/CarX sorbent inside the NTD, and subjected to a GC-MS analysis. This allowed the identification of 130 VOMs from different chemical families that were further processed using discriminant analysis through the partial least squares method (PLS-DA). Several pathways are over activated in cancer patients, being phenylalanine pathway in BC and limonene and pinene degradation pathway in CC the most relevant. Butanoate metabolism is also highly activated in both cancers, as well as tyrosine metabolism in a lesser extension. In BC the xenobiotics metabolism by cytochrome P450 and fatty acid biosynthesis are also differentially activated. Different clusters corresponding to the groups recruited allowed to define sets of volatile organic metabolites (VOMs fingerprints) that exhibit high classification rates, sensitivity and specificity in the discrimination of the selected cancers. As far as we are aware, this is the first time that NTME is used for isolation urinary volatile metabolites, being the obtained results very promising. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB During the last few years multiplex real-time or quantitative polymerase chain reaction PCR (qPCR) has become the method of choice for multiplex gene expression changes and gene copy number variations (CNVs) analysis. However, such determinations require the use of different fluorescent labels for the different amplified sequences, which increases significantly the costs of the analysis and limits the applicability of the technique for simultaneous amplification of many targets of interest in a single reaction. In this regard, the use of the coupling between gel electrophoresis (GE) separation with inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) detection allows the label-free determination of multiplex PCR-amplified sequences (amplicons) by monitoring the P present in the DNA backbone. The quantitative dimension is obtained since under optimal and controlled multiplex PCR conditions the peak areas of the separated amplicons are directly proportional to the amount of DNA template in the original sample. Moreover, the calibration of the GE-ICP-MS system with a DNA ladder permits direct estimation of the size (bp) of the PCR products. The suitability of the proposed multiplex strategy has been evaluated addressing two different situations: determination of CNVs and gene expression changes in human ovarian cancer cells. In the first case, the results obtained for the simultaneous quantitation of CNVs of four genes (HER2, CCNE1, GSTM1, ACTB) on DNA obtained from OVCAR-3 cells were in accordance with the literature data, and also with the results obtained by conventional simplex qPCR. In the second case, multiplex gene expression changes of BAX, ERCC1 and CTR1 genes, using ACTB as constitutive gene, on A2780cis respect to A2780 cells, resistant and sensitive to cisplatin, respectively, provided the same information as single reaction reverse transcription (RT)-qPCR.

AB A novel ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry method was developed to enable the analysis of ultra-low levels of lignin phenols (<100 fmol) in environmental samples. The method included a sample clean-up with a polymer sorbent based solid-phase extraction and reversed-phase chromatography that allowed separation of all lignin phenols with minimal interference from co-eluting matrix components. The application of C-13-labeled surrogate standards effectively compensated for variability associated with sample preparation and ion suppression. The method was fully validated and compared to gas chromatography-electron impact ionizationtandem mass spectrometry for Suwannee River humic acid standard reference material and extracted riverine dissolved organic matter. The comparison demonstrated the robustness and suitability of the method for ultra-low lignin phenol concentrations and high matrix interference. The simple and fast sample preparation coupled to analysis without derivatization makes it feasible for routine and high-volume analyses. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB As a significant and promising conducting polymer, poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) has attracted considerable attention in the last decade. This review aims at giving a comprehensive illustration about current progress on the synthesis and electrochemical sensing applications of PEDOT-based materials in environmental monitoring, food and drug analysis and health care. PEDOT-based materials, such as PEDOT, functionalized PEDOT and PEDOT composites were fabricated mainly by chemical polymerization and electrochemical polymerization. Various nanostructures with large surface area, high conductivity, fast electron transfer rate, hydrophobic interaction and good biocompatibility were displayed by the PEDOT-based materials. Synergetic effects were enhanced dramatically in electrochemical (bio) sensors by PEDOT composites, especially by those incorporated with versatile nanomaterials. Through this paper, we hope to attract attention from a wider community and inspire researchers to take advantage of PEDOT in approaching scientific challenges and developments.

AB The number of chemical species is crucial in analyzing pulsed field gradient nuclear magnetic resonance spectral data. Any method to determine the number must handle the obstacles of collinearity and noise. Collinearity in pulsed field gradient NMR data poses a serious challenge to and fails many existing methods. A novel method is proposed by taking advantage of the two obstacles instead of eliminating them. In the proposed method, the determination is based on discriminating decay-profile-dominant eigenvectors from noise-dominant ones, and the discrimination is implemented with a novel low- and high-frequency energy ratio (LHFER). Its performance is validated with both simulated and experimental data. The method is mathematically rigorous, computationally efficient, and readily automated. It also has the potential to be applied to other types of data in which collinearity is fairly severe. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In order to further improve the electroanalytical performance toward heavy metal ions, core-ring structured NiCo2O4 nanoplatelets were used to modify glass carbon electrode (GCE) for the determination of heavy metal ions in water. Owing to the high surface area of NiCo2O4 nanoplatelets, the Pb(II) sensitivity increased by a factor of 1.70, and the detection limit decreased by a factor of 2.64 as compared to solid NiCo2O4 nanoparticles modified GCE. Interestingly, NiCo2O4 nanoplatelets showed different sensitivities toward heavy metal ions with the same valence states, following the order Pb(II) > Cd(II) > Hg(II)> Cu(II). To better and scientifically understand the difference in sensitivity, adsorption and desorption abilities were integrated into account. Density functional theory calculations verified that the adsorption capability of NiCo2O4 toward Pb(II) was strongest among all heavy metal ions, thereby resulting in the largest sensitivity. Further desorption current measurements indicated the large desorption barrier of Cu(II) was another important factor leading to its lowest sensitivity. Finally, the applicability of the proposed method was demonstrated by the detection of heavy metal ions in real seawater. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A series of novel MOFs/PVA composite cryogel (MIL-101(Cr)/PVA, MIL-100(Fe)/PVA, ZIF-8(Zn)/PVA, MOF-199(Cu)/PVA and MIL-53(Al)/PVA) were fabricated by using a facile and green freeze-thaw approach for the first time. MIL-101(Cr)/PVA cryogel was selected as a VA-SPE sorbent for extraction of four NSAIDs in environmental water samples. The procedures of condition investigation (synthesis and extraction optimization) and characterization were also performed. And a satisfactory result of methodology validation was obtained by making use of HPLC-MS/MS. Under the optimum conditions, good sensitivity levels were achieved with the limits of detection between 0.007 and 0.037 mu g L-1, a linearity of 0.10-10 mu g L-1 for phenylbutazone, indomethacin, nimesulide and 0.020-2.0 mu g L-1 for benorilate (r(2) >= 0.9934). The relative recoveries of the target analytes were in the range from 78.44% to 105.7% with relative standard deviation (RSD) from 1.33% to 9.85%. In the extraction process, MIL-101(Cr)/PVA cryogel as a whole sheet outperformed the pristine dispersive MIL-101(Cr) in separation from solvent, and the application of cryogel also simplified the operation procedure. Additionally, the combination of PVA with MOFs might strengthen the interaction ability between the sorbent and analytes. This novel pretreatment method had a variety of merits, such as easy operation, high enrichment efficiency and low matrix effect. It looks forward to further optimization or functionalization and application of these MOFs/PVA cryogel in various disciplines. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A simple, robust and effective extraction procedure for the determination of 74 pharmaceuticals in different fish tissues by ultrasensitive high performance liquid chromatography with electrospray high resolution product scan (HPLC-ESI-HRPS) was developed and validated. Different extraction solvent mixtures were tested to achieve the highest recoveries of the selected analytes, to minimize the influence of a complex matrix and to reduce the total analysis time as well as cost of analysis.
   A mixture of acetonitrile + isopropanol (3:1 v/v) acidified with 0.1% formic acid was the best extraction solvent among the five solvents tested for most of the tissues with the exception of plasma samples, where only acidified acetonitrile exhibited the best performance. The developed method was validated at three concentration levels (5, 20 and 50 ng g-1) in five different fish tissues (liver, kidney, brain, muscle and plasma). Most of the target analytes were extracted with a recovery between 60 and 130%. Very low limits of quantification (LOQs) were obtained for the majority of the pharmaceuticals in all of the studied matrices. The developed analytical method was successfully applied for the analysis of common carp (Cyprinus carpio) originating from the waste water effluent-dominated pond Cezarka (Czech Republic). The results confirmed the importance of multi-tissue analysis to obtain complex information on the distribution of pharmaceuticals in fish. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) is a technique that can map analyte spatial distribution directly onto a tissue section. This enables the spatial correlation of molecular entities with a tissue morphology to be investigated. Analyte annotation in MSI is intrinsically linked to the mass accuracy of the data. Mass accuracy and analyte identification are determined by such factors as the experimental set up and the data processing workflow. We present an MSI data processing workflow that uses a label-free approach to compensate for mass shifts. The algorithms developed were designed to perform efficiently even for datasets much larger than computer's memory. Herein, we present the application of the developed processing workflow to a dataset with more than 13.000 pixels and similar to 50.000 mass channels. We assessed the overall mass accuracy in the range m/z 400 to 1200 using silver and gold sputtered nanolayers. With our novel processing workflow we were able to obtain mass errors as low as 5 ppm using a TOF instrument. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Amyloid-beta (A beta is generated by proteolytic processing of amyloid precursor protein (APP) by beta-secretase (BACE-1) and gamma-secretase. Amyloid-beta is responsible for the formation of senile plaques in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Consequently, inhibition of beta-secretase (BACE-1), a rate-limiting enzyme in the production of A, constitutes an attractive therapeutic approach to the treatment of AD. This paper reports an inkjet printing-based fluorescence assay for high throughput screening of beta-secretase inhibitors achieved by employing a BACE-1 FRET substrate (Rh-Glu-Val-Asn-Leu-Asp-Ala-Glu-Phe-Lys-Quencher). This peptide substrate is known to be a readily available and suitable substrate for proteolytic activity, and it has high affinity to BACE-1. The BACE-1 peptide substrate printed on parchment paper was effectively cleaved by BACE-1, which was printed on the same spot. The amount of enzyme and substrate required for this inkjet printing-based BACE-1 assay can be less than 1.4x10(3), permitting the evaluation of inhibitor activity with femtomolar potency. The inkjet-printing-based BACE-1 inhibitory assay revealed inhibitory effects of inhibitor IV and STA on BACE-1 with an IM50 of 1.00 x 10(-15) mol and 1.01 x 10(-14) mol, respectively. These data confirm that both BACE-1 inhibitors (inhibitor IV and STA) actively inhibited the BACE-1 proteolysis of BACE-1 substrate on parchment paper. It important to note that the number of mole of BACE-1-substrate and enzyme utilized in the printing-based enzymatic assay are 1.4x10(3) smaller than the amount used in the conventional well-plate assay. The inkjet printing-based inhibitory assay constitutes a versatile high throughput technique and the IM50 values of the inhibitors were obtained with satisfactory reproducibility, suggesting that this inkjet-printing BACE-1 inhibitory assay could be quite suitable for the screening of new potential BACE-1 inhibitors for AD.

AB An excess of the excitatory neurotransmitter, glutamate, in the synaptic cleft during hypoxia/ischemia provokes development of neurotoxicity and originates from the reversal of Na+-dependent glutamate transporters located in the plasma membrane of presynaptic brain nerve terminals. Here, we have optimized an electrochemical glutamate biosensor using glutamate oxidase and developed a biosensor-based methodological approach for analysis of rates of tonic, exocytotic and transporter-mediated glutamate release from isolated rat brain nerve terminals (synaptosomes). Changes in the extracellular glutamate concentrations from 11.5 +/- 0.9 to 11.7 +/- 0.9 mu M for 6 min reflected a low tonic release of endogenous glutamate from nerve terminals. Depolarization-induced exocytotic release of endogenous glutamate was equal to 7.5 +/- 1.0 mu M and transporter reversal was 8.0 +/- 1.0 mu M for 6 min. The biosensor data correlated well with the results obtained using radiolabelled L-[C-14]glutamate, spectrofluorimetric glutamate dehydrogenase and amino acid analyzer assays. The blood plasma glutamate concentration was also tested, and reliability of the biosensor measurements was confirmed by glutamate dehydrogenase assay. Therefore, the biosensor-based approach for accurate monitoring rates of tonic, exocytotic and transporter-mediated release of glutamate in nerve terminals was developed and its adequacy was confirmed by independent analytical methods. The biosensor measurements provided precise data on changes in the concentrations of endogenous glutamate in nerve terminals in response to stimulation. We consider that the glutamate biosensor-based approach can be applied in clinics for neuromonitoring glutamate-related parameters in brain samples, liquids and blood plasma in stroke, brain trauma, therapeutic hypothermia treatment, etc., and also in laboratory work to record glutamate release and uptake kinetics in nerve terminals.

AB Alzheimer's disease (AD) considered as the third health "killer" has seriously threatened the health of the elderly. However, the modern diagnostic strategies of AD present several disadvantages: the low accuracy and specificity resulting in some false-negative diagnoses, and the poor sensitivity leading to a delayed treatment. In view of this situation, a enzyme-free and target-triggered signal amplification strategy, based on graphene oxide (GO) and entropy-driven strand displacement reaction (ESDR) principle, was proposed. In this strategy, when the hairpin structure probes (H)specially binds with betaamyloid-(1-42) oligomers (A beta 42 oligomers), it's structure will be opened, causing the bases complementary to FAM-labeled replacement probes R (R1 and R2) exposed. At this time, R1 and R2 will hybridize with H, resulting in the bound A beta 42 oligomers released. The released A beta 42 oligomers would participate in the next cycle reaction, making the signal amplified. As a quencher, GO could absorb the free single-stranded DNA R1 and R2 and quench their fluorescence; however, the DNA duplex still exists free and keeps its signal-on. Through the detection of A beta 42 oligomers in exosomes, this ultrasensitive detection method with the advantages of low limit of detection (LOD, 20 pM), great accuracy, excellent precision and convenience provides an excellent prospect for AD's early diagnosis.

AB In this study, a system was established for the detection of tetracyclines (TCs) by simply mixing graphene quantum dots (GQDs) and Eu3+. The GQDs-Eu3+ system exhibits both strong emission of GQDs and weak characteristic emission of Eu3+ upon 360 nm excitation. In the presence of TCs, the luminescence of GQDs was quenched, while the luminescence of Eu3+ was significantly enhanced. It is worth to mention that the GQDs we prepared possess a lot of carboxyl groups on the surface and edge. This carboxyl groups play an important role in fluorescent enhancement of Eu3+. On the basis of this effect, a novel label free ratiometric sensor was developed for the detection of TCs. Under the optimized conditions, linear concentration ranges from 0 to 20 mu M for tetracycline was found, and the detection limits was 8.2 nM. This system also exhibited excellent selectivity toward TCs over other antibiotics. In addition, it was successfully applied to the determination of tetracycline in river water and milk samples. The proposed system was simple in design, fast in operation, rapid in response and cost-effective. In view of the advantages, the developed system demonstrates great potential for the detection of TCs in environmental and biological samples. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Afterwards, the morphology and structure were characterized by scanning electron microscope (SEM), transmission electron microscope (TEM), X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Based on the three-dimensional porous chestnut-like NiCo2O4, an electrochemical sensor for hydrazine (N2H4) detection is fabricated. This electrochemical platform can realize good selectivity, excellent stability, high sensitivity (similar to 2154.4 mu A mM(-1) cm(-2)), and low detection limit (0.3 mu M), as well as a wide linear range from 1 mu M to 1096 mu M. The synergistic effect of nickel-cobalt in such mixed transition metal oxides which Co in Co3O4 is partially replaced by Ni are beneficial for enhancing sensing properties. This study proves that three-dimensional porous chestnut-like NiCo2O4 is electrochemically active for catalytic performance which is particular and promising material for good application in the practical detection of N2H4.

AB In spite of demonstrated lack of accuracy and consistency, quantification of steroid hormones is still most commonly executed via immunoassays. Mass spectrometric methods with triple quadrupole instruments are well established and, because of their proven robustness and sensitivity, best suited for targeted analysis. However, recent studies have shown that high-resolution mass spectrometers, like quadrupole time-of-flight instruments (QTOF), show comparable performance in terms of quantification and can generate additional sample information via untargeted profiling workflows. We demonstrate that adequate accuracy and selectivity for estradiol and testosterone can be achieved with a QTOF by data-independent acquisition with sequential window acquisition of all theoretical fragment-ion mass spectra (SWATH). Besides potential combination of targeted quantification and untargeted profiling, SWATH offers advantages with respect to sensitivity because the reduced total number of MS/MS experiments could be used to increase accumulation time without increasing cycle time. By applying a surrogate calibrant method leading to successful validation, a reliable method for absolute steroid quantification and high potential for steroid profiling has been developed. Linear calibration was achieved in the range from 10 to 1,000 pg mL(-1) for C-13(3)-estradiol and from 20 to 15,000 pg mL(-1) for C-13(3) testosterone. Results for inter-day precision (C-13(3)-estradiol: 4.5-10.2%; C-13(3)-testosterone: 5.1-7.8%) and inter-day accuracy (C-13(3)-estradiol: 94.6-112.8%; C-13(3)-testosterone: 98.2-107.7%) were found to be well acceptable. Eventually, the method has been utilized to measure clinical samples of a study in which male volunteers obtained transdermal estradiol patches and sex hormone levels were quantified in plasma.

AB Food contact materials (FCMs), especially plastics, are known to be a potential source of contaminants in food. In fact, various groups of additives are used to protect the integrity of the material during processing and life time. However, these intentionally added substances (IAS) could also lead to degradation products called non-intentionally added substances (NIAS), due to reactions occurring in the polymeric material. Complex mixtures of components may therefore be generated within the material, creating a source of potential migrating substances towards food in contact. In this context, an innovative analytical approach is proposed in order to assess IAS and NIAS in plastic FCMs for a fast screening of their composition. For this purpose, solvent extracts of polyethylene (PE) pellets, containers and films were analyzed by flow injection analysis-mass spectrometry (FIA-MS). This direct approach offers the ability to perform a large number of analyses in a short time. Mass spectral fingerprints were then treated by a multivariate data analysis technique called independent components analysis (ICA) in order to overcome the complexity of such data and to highlight hidden information related to IAS and NIAS molecules. ICA applied on mass spectral fingerprints of PE extracts highlighted group discriminations related to different m/z values which were putatively assigned to IAS and also to NIAS. In order to confirm these putative annotations, a hybrid LTQ-Orbitrap was used for high resolution mass spectrometry analysis. Moreover, MS/MS experiments were performed on some discriminant ions to improve their putative identification. The proposed methodology combining FIA-MS fingerprints and ICA proved its efficiency in identifying IAS and NIAS in plastic FCMs and its capability to discriminate different PE samples, in a relatively fast approach compared to classical analytical techniques. This approach may help the FCMs classification for compounders in the selection of the starting substances in plastic formulation and for plastic converters in the control of manufacturing processes as well as for the monitoring of final products.

AB Recent advances in the field of microfabrication have made the application of high-throughput microfluidics feasible. Mixing which is an essential part of any miniaturized standalone system remains the key challenge. This paper proposes a geometrically simple micromixer for efficient mixing for high-throughput microfluidic devices. The proposed micromixer utilizes a curved microchannel (spiral microchannel) to induce chaotic advection and enhance the mixing process. It is shown that the spiral microchannel is more efficient in comparison to a straight microchannel, mixing wise. The pressure drop in the spiral microchannel is only slightly higher than that in the straight microchannel. It is found that the mixing process in the spiral microchannel enhances with increasing the inlet velocity, unlike what happens in the straight microchannel. It is also realized that the initial radius of the spiral microchannel plays a prominent role in enhancing the mixing process. Studying different cross sections, it is gathered that the square cross section yields a higher mixing quality. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This paper presents a dual functional extracellular recording biosensor based on a light-addressable potentiometric sensor (LAPS). The design and fabrication of this biosensor make it possible to record both extracellular membrane potential changes and ATP release from a single taste bud cell for the first time. For detecting ATP release, LAPS chip was functionalized with ATP-sensitive DNA aptamer by covalent immobilization. Taste bud cells isolated from rat were cultured on LAPS surface. When the desired single taste bud cell was illuminated by modulated light, ATP release from single taste bud cells can be measured by recording the shifts of bias voltage-photocurrent curves (I-V curves) when the LAPS chip is working in discrete mode. On the other hand, extracellular membrane potential changes can be monitored by recording the fluctuation of LAPS photocurrent when the LAPS chip is working in continuous mode. The results show this biosensor can effectively record the enhancive effect of the bitter substance and inhibitory effect of the carbenoxolone (CBX) on the extracellular membrane potential changes and ATP release of single taste bud cells. In addition, the inhibitory effect of CBX also confirms LAPS extracellular recordings are originated from bitter signal transduction. It is proved this biosensor is suitable for extracellular recording of ATP release and membrane potential changes of single taste bud cells. It is suggested this biosensor could be applied to investigating taste signal transduction at the single-cell level as well as applied to other types of cells which have similar functions to taste bud cells.

AB The research and applications of liquid chromatographic (LC) chips receive more and more attention due to the numerous advantages over the traditional and larger analytical systems, e.g. requirement for small sample and reagent volumes, fast and inexpensive analysis, dead-volume free connections and the ability to multiplex measurements. Since LC is one of the most powerful separation techniques, its miniaturization seems an obvious target of lab-on-a-chip developments. However, the common procedures used in the preparation of chromatographic columns are not well applicable at the microscopic level. Additionally, implementing sample injection of (sub) nanoliter volumes (with sensitive detection) is still a challenge.
   This review deals with microchips incorporating particle-based stationary phases and focuses on the lab-made and commercialized chromatographic separations discussing the particle retention methods, the designs/constructions of LC chips, the separation performances and possible applications. A survey about microfluidic chips - capable of efficient separations and high-throughput sample pretreatment hyphenated with electrospray mass spectrometric devices to achieve sensitive detection has also been made. The merits and limitations of different commercial LC chips were compared with other published approaches, as well. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Concerns about the environmental impact of shale energy exploration (i.e., hydraulic fracturing and other well stimulation techniques) have risen due to its rapid expansion in the United States and other countries. Soils in shale basins engaged in unconventional oil and gas development can become contaminated by volatile organic compounds (VOCs), such as benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylenes (BTEX) through mishandling of chemical additives, products, and/or waste fluids. In this study, room temperature ionic liquids (RTILs) were evaluated as solvents in an effort to increase sensitivity and to reduce and normalize matrix effects associated with varying soil compositions during analysis. Headspace gas chromatography mass spectrometry (HS-GC-MS) experiments demonstrated that hydrophilic RTILs 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium ethyl sulfate [EMIM][ESO4], 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium diethyl phosphate [EMIM][DEP], and tris(2-hydroxyethyl) methylammonium methylsulfate [MTEOA] [MeOSO3] normalized the response for BTEX compounds between 2 different soils, sandy loam and sandy clay loam. Furthermore, the optimization of the HS equilibration time to 30min resulted in the reduction of matrix effects in certified reference soils of sand, clay, and loam textures. Limits of detection and limits of quantification were in the sub-to mid-pg g(-1) level in soil. For determination at 1 g of certified BTEX reference soil, the relative standard deviation was within 10% and percent recoveries were above 80% for toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylenes. This method reduces the need to characterize and matrix-match soil texture for calibration purposes. It also reduces the analysis time and increases precision and accuracy for the quantification of BTEX in variable soil matrices relative to standard methods. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB Mass spectral data sets often contain experimental artefacts, and data filtering prior to statistical analysis is crucial to extract reliable information. This is particularly true in untargeted metabolomics analyses, where the analyte(s) of interest are not known a priori. It is often assumed that chemical interferents (i.e. solvent contaminants such as plasticizers) are consistent across samples, and can be removed by background subtraction from blank injections. On the contrary, it is shown here that chemical contaminants may vary in abundance across each injection, potentially leading to their misidentification as relevant sample components. With this metabolomics study, we demonstrate the effectiveness of hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) of replicate injections (technical replicates) as a methodology to identify chemical interferents and reduce their contaminating contribution to metabolomics models. Pools of metabolites with varying complexity were prepared from the botanical Angelica keiskei Koidzumi and spiked with known metabolites. Each set of pools was analyzed in triplicate and at multiple concentrations using ultraperformance liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS). Before filtering, HCA failed to cluster replicates in the data sets. To identify contaminant peaks, we developed a filtering process that evaluated the relative peak area variance of each variable within triplicate injections. These interferent peaks were found across all samples, but did not show consistent peak area from injection to injection, even when evaluating the same chemical sample. This filtering process identified 128 ions that appear to originate from the UPLC-MS system. Data sets collected for a high number of pools with comparatively simple chemical composition were highly influenced by these chemical interferents, as were samples that were analyzed at a low concentration. When chemical interferent masses were removed, technical replicates clustered in all data sets. This work highlights the importance of technical replication in mass spectrometry-based studies, and presents a new application of HCA as a tool for evaluating the effectiveness of data filtering prior to statistical analysis.

AB High-pressure nanoelectrospray ionization (nanoESI) source is a recently developed technique in which the electrospray ionization is generated inside an enclosed chamber with gas pressure higher than the atmospheric pressure. In this paper, the performance of nanoESI under different gas pressures, emitter position, ion inlet temperature, additive for desalination are presented. Under a pressure of 2 bars, the nanoESI is almost eased from the electrical discharge problem, and that offers a wider tuning window for the emitter potential to produces a higher and more stable ion signal. With optimized ion inlet temperature, the high-pressure operation facilitates the generation of ion species of higher charge-state from the highly aqueous solution, and produced less sodium adducts. A preparation method for the high-throughput analysis of raw biological samples using disposable plastic nanoESI emitter is also described. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Coupling infrared (IR) spectroscopy to microfluidic devices provides a powerful tool for characterizing complex chemical and biochemical reactions. Examples of microfluidic devices coupled with infrared spectroscopy have been limited, however, largely due to the difficulties associated with fabricating systems in common infrared transparent materials like CaF2. Recent reports have shown that polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) can be used as an IR transparent substrate when fabricated with thin layers. The use of soft lithography with PDMS expands the library of possible designs that can be achieved for IR measurements in microfluidics. In initial reports with thin PDMS, the target analytes were small molecules; however, IR spectroscopy offers a powerful tool to study protein structure and reactions. Here, a PDMS microfluidic device compatible with IR spectroscopy was fabricated by means of spin-coating of PDMS pre-polymer to obtain thin PDMS microfluidic features. The device was comprised of only PDMS and IR absorption of PDMS was significantly minimized due to the thickness (similar to 40 mu m) of the PDMS layer. The use of thin PDMS allowed for measuring the amide I and II vibrational bands of proteins that have been difficult to measure in other microfluidic devices. To demonstrate the power of the system, the microfluidic device was successfully used to measure the enzyme kinetics as one class of important biochemical reactions with broad use in a variety of fields from medicine to biotechnology. As a model, the reaction of glucose oxidase with glucose was tracked by following the formation of gluconic acid. Michaelis-Menten kinetics from the device were compared with bulk solution measurements and found to be in good agreement. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In clinical diagnosis, monitoring of uric acid (UA) is generally realized by combining uricase with natural peroxidase. The use of bio-enzymes, however, shadows some highlights of these methods due to their vulnerable activities against environments. Herein, we report a novel biosensor for the natural enzyme-free colorimetric detection of UA by using CoP nanosheet arrays grown on Ni foam (NF) as a monolithic peroxidase mimic. The integrated nanozyme can be put into and taken out from reaction systems conveniently with only tweezers, making it possible for on-demand analysis. As demonstrated, the obtained CoP/NF exhibits outstanding peroxidase-like activity to trigger the oxidation reaction of colorless 3,305,50-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) to a blue product (TMBox) mediated by H2O2. It is found that the blue TMBox can be reduced to colorless TMB again by UA selectively, thus the presence of UA in solutions will suppress the color reaction of TMB. Based on this principle, an uricase-free biosensor is developed for the photometric determination of UA, providing a wide detection range of 1-200 mu M and a limit of detection down to 1.0 mu M. In addition, the fabricated biosensor can be applied for measuring UA in clinical samples with merits of simple operation and good reliability, exhibiting its great promise in clinical diagnosis.

AB A high-sensitive detection of sequence-specific DNA was established based on the formation of G-quadruplex-hemin complex through continuous hybridization chain reaction (HCR). Taking HIV DNA sequence as an example, a capture probe complementary to part of HIV DNA was firstly self-assembled onto the surface of Au electrode. Then a specially designed assistant probe with both terminals complementary to the target DNA and a G-quadruplex-forming sequence in the center was introduced into the detection solution. In the presence of both the target DNA and the assistant probe, the target DNA can be captured on the electrode surface and then a continuous HCR can be conducted due to the mutual recognition of the target DNA and the assistant probe, leading to the formation of a large number of G-quadruplex on the electrode surface. With the help of hemin, a pronounced electrochemical signal can be observed in differential pulse voltammetry (DPV), due to the formation of G-quadruplex-hemin complex. The peak current is linearly related with the logarithm of the concentration of the target DNA in the range from 10 fM to 10 pM. The electrochemical sensor has high selectivity to clearly discriminate single-base mismatched and three-base mismatched sequences from the original HIV DNA sequence. Moreover, the established DNA sensor was challenged by detection of HIV DNA in human serum samples, which showed the low detection limit of 6.3 fM. Thus it has great application prospect in the field of clinical diagnosis and environmental monitoring. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This study strategically fabricates a nucleic acid functionalized gold nanoparticle and graphene oxide composite probe (AuNP/GO probe) to achieve both the recognition and in situ monitoring of cytoplasmic target precursor microRNAs (pre-miRNAs) and mature microRNAs (miRNAs) in living cells. The pre-miRNA-21 detection with AuNP probes has a good linear range of 0-300 nM and a limit of detection (LOD) of 4.5 nM, whereas the GO probe has a linear relationship with mature miRNA-21 from 0.1 to 10 nM with a LOD of 1.74 nM. This assay was utilized to directly visualize the relative expression levels of pre-and mature forms of miRNA-21 and let-7a. The results suggested that the expression levels of precursor miRNAs remain constant in cancer cells and normal cells. However, the expression levels of mature miRNAs vary widely, demonstrating the "up-regulation" of miRNA-21 and "down-regulation" of let-7a in cancer cells in contrast to that in normal cells. The practicality of this strategy was verified by in situ monitoring changes in cytoplasmic pre-miRNA-21 and mature miRNA-21 in response to small-molecule inhibitors of miRNA-21.

AB Interval based chemometric algorithms have proven to be very powerful for spectral alignments, spectral regressions and spectral classifications. The interval-based methods may not only improve the performance, but also reduce model complexity and enhance the spectral interpretation. Extended Canonical Variate Analysis (ECVA) is a powerful method for multiple group classifications of multivariate data and can easily be extended to an interval approach, iECVA. This study outlines the iECVA method and compares its performance to interval Partial Least Squares Discriminant Analysis (iPLS-DA) on three spectroscopic datasets from Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR), Near Infrared (NIR) and Infrared (IR) spectroscopy, respectively. The results invariantly show that the interval-based classification methods greatly enhance the interpretability of the models by identifying important spectral regions, which facilitate interpretation and biomarker discovery. Although the results for the two methods are similar regarding the number of misclassifications and identified important regions, the model complexity of the PLS-DA proved to consistently lower than the ECVA. The Matlab source codes for both iECVA and iPLS-DA are made freely available at www.models.life.ku.dk. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This paper proposes a flexible and novel strategy that alternating trilinear decomposition (ATLD) method combines with two-dimensional linear discriminant analysis (2D-LDA). The developed strategy was applied to three-way chemical data for the characterization and classification of samples. In order to confirm the methodology performances of characterization and classification, a series of simulated three-way data arrays and a real-life EEMs data set involving the characterization and classification of tea samples according to the tea varieties were subjected to ATLD-2DLDA analysis. Further, the obtained results were compared with those obtained by using LDA based on relative concentrations of ATLD (ATLD-LDA), discriminant analysis by N-way partial least square (N-PLS-DA) and 2D-LDA method. For the simulated data sets with respect to different levels of noise and class overlap as well as number of groups, the ATLD-2DLDA always obtains superior classification performances than the ATLD-LDA, 2D-LDA and N-PLS-DA methods. Regarding the real EEMs data set of tea samples, the proposed methodology not only could provide a chemically meaningful model of the data for characterizing the different tea varieties, but also achieved the best correct classification rate (100%) for the test samples, compared with the results of ATLD-LDA (83.9%), 2D-LDA (90.3%) and N-PLS-DA (90.3%). These results demonstrated that the proposed methodology was indeed a feasible and reliable tool for characterization and classification of three-way chemical data arrays in a flexible and accurate manner.

AB A literature criticism is given on methods currently using gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS) to determine plant cannabinoids (p-CBDs). In this study, trialkylsilylation of seven p-CBDs (including their transformation products formed in the drug user's body) was compared applying various alkylsilyl reagents1 and the mass fragmentation properties of the corresponding derivatives were characterized. Derivatization, mass fragmentation and quantitation related model investigations were optimized as a function of the reaction times and conditions. Special emphasis was put (i) on the maximum responses of species, (ii) on the proportions of formed stable products, suitable for selective quantitation of all seven p-CBDs simultaneously. Results, as novel to the field confirmed that HMDS + TFA, for p-CBDs never applied reagent before, serves as their derivatization reagent of choice. These species were characterized by their retention, mass fragmentation and analytical performance characteristics. In model solutions with injected amounts in the range of 20 pg-2000 pg, repeatability (average 4.98% RSD, varying between 2.98 and 6.2% RSD), linearity (R-2, 0.9956-0.9995), LOQ (20-80 pg/mu L injected species) and recovery (95.2-104%) values were defined. The practical utility of this proposal, along with method development validation, was shown in a particularly unique manner and supported by the novel, extraction free, direct sample preparation working strategy. For this purpose, two Cannabis-type ruderalis (C-trd) plant tissues (C-trd1, C-trd2) were directly derivatized in the presence of the matrix. This process, which approaches green chemistry, performed without the use of organic solvents, was associated with the quantitation of self p-CBD contents of C-trd plant tissues. Applying 0.5-2.0 mg dried tissues, adding standards, the following self p-CBDs contents were confirmed: in C-trd1 6.6 mu g/mg CBD, 4.4 mu g/mg CBN and 1.3 mu g/mg CBC, while in C-trd2 0.46 mu g/mg CBD, 0.27 mu g/mg CBC and 0.19 mu g/mg CBG were found. The latter results were characterized by repeatability (2.52-4.99% RSD), linearity (R-2, 0.9640-0.9997) and recovery (87.9-109%) data. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Labor-and time-intensive sample preparation and liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS) analysis are required for traditional pharmacokinetics (PK) studies. In order to simplify and accelerate the analytical process of the PK study, solid phase microextraction (SPME) combined with thermal desorption-electrospray ionization/mass spectrometry (TD-ESI/MS) was developed for rapid characterization of trace drug in biological fluids. Methylphenidate in plasma was extracted and concentrated by direct immersion SPME using fused-silica fibers coated with polydimethylsiloxane. The analytes on the SPME fiber were then characterized by TD-ESI/MS. Matrix-matched calibration with multiple reaction monitoring analysis was conducted to quantify methylphenidate. A linear calibration curve was constructed over a concentration range of 0.2-25 ng mL(-1) (r = 0.997). The quantitative results obtained by SPME-TD-ESI/MS were validated by LC-MS/MS. The average relative error for both methods was found to be -5.3%. As a viable alternative to LC-MS, SPME-TD-ESI/MS enables simple, rapid, and high-throughput analysis of drugs in plasma. The developed approach is particularly beneficial to PK studies for a very small sample volume (10 mu L) is needed, the extraction time is as short as 3min, and the detection time is less than 30 s.

AB A novel microvalve using the electrokinetic motion of electrically induced Janus droplet (EIJD) is presented in this paper. The device is fabricated by injecting an EIJD with the diameter of approximately 80 mm into a microchamber connecting several microchannel branches. The EIJD is developed from an oil droplet covered by Al2O3-nanoparticles under electric field. The microvalve is controllable by electric field. Under an electric field, the Janus droplet undergoes electrokinetic motion in the microchamber, moves to one branch channel and blocks its entrance. By switching the electric field direction, the Janus droplet detaches from this entrance and moves to block another branch channel. In this way, the flow direction in the microvalve changes. In this research, the electrokinetic motion of the EIJD in a circular microchamber under the switching electric field was studied first. The result indicates that the Janus droplet always rotates to get aligned with the electric field. Then, the performance of the microvalve was investigated systematically. The results confirm the capability of such a microvalve in sealing, switching time and flow rate control. Furthermore, by comparing with the case of using a plain oil droplet in such a microvalve, it is proven that the EIJD is essential in realization of a non-leakage microvalve. The EIJD-based microvalve shown in this paper offers great potential in fabricating integrated microfluidic devices. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This paper presents a cost-effective and reliable diffusion-based humidity removal membrane for microfluidic-based gas analyzers. The developed humidity control device reduces the relative humidity of a gas chamber and also stabilizes the humidity using inexpensive inorganic salts. A 3D-printed microfluidic gas sensor is used to test four different volatile organic compounds (VOCs) including three alcohols and one ketone in different relative humidity levels ranging from 15% to 80%. To study the effects of humidity on different features of the transient response of the sensor, two different feature extraction methods are used. These methods are (i) normalization method, removing the effect of any changes in the response level for identifying the nature of the gas, and (ii) integration method, which differentiates between different response levels due to different concentrations or humidity levels. The results show that the sensor fails to differentiate between different VOCs or even between different concentrations of the same gas when there is a slight change (as small as 5%) in humidity. In essence, the device is vulnerable to the errors occur due to the presence of humidity even after the post processing analysis (feature extraction). Thus, a humidity control and removal membrane is developed in order to minimize the effect of humidity. The selectivity of the sensor with and without the use of the humidity removal membrane is compared and shown to be 36% more in the case of utilizing the humidity removal membrane. The proposed humidity control system successfully removes the effect of humidity on the response pattern of the sensor and can be used for different applications such as breath analyzers for which lowering the level of humidity of the exhaled breath is crucial before analyzing the VOCs of interest.

AB Quantum dots (QDs) have been widely used to develop analytical methods due to their unique fluorescent and photoelectrochemical characteristics. However, analytical strategies based on their catalytic property are rarely reported. Here, we demonstrate that the photoreductive ability of QDs can be utilized to develop a sensitive and selective colorimetric sensor for Cu(II). By using UV irradiation, 3,3',5,5'-tet-ramethylbenzidine (TMB) is oxidized to its oxidation product, which can be reduced back to TMB by QDs. The presence of Cu(II) decreases the reductive activity of QDs and results in a color change in a signal-on format. The proposed sensor can be activated using a portable UV lamp or direct sunlight. Under optimized conditions, the detection limit (S/N = 3) is 10 nM via spectrophotometry and 0.1 mM by visible color change. This sensing system was applied to quantify Cu(II) in real samples, such as river water and tap water. Results were in agreement with those obtained using inductively coupled plasma spectrometry (ICP). This study may provide new ideas for the development of QD-based sensors. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB In the study, a novel two dimensional metal-organic framework (Cu-TCPP nanosheets) based fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) aptasensing platform was developed for detecting antibiotics. Cu-TCPP nanosheets were employed for quenching the background fluorescence and circular strand-replacement DNA polymerization (CSRP) for signal amplification. To fulfill the purpose, we designed an aptamer hairpin probe (HP) whose stem can be opened while specifically binding to target. Then the opened HP would bind with the primer. Under the action of polymerase, extension reaction was induced to generate double-stranded DNA (dsDNA), and then the target was released for the next cycle. Finally, SYBR Green I (SG) can bind with dsDNA to produce strong fluorescence response for quantification of target. It's worth mentioning that the fluorescence of HP/SG complex and free SG could be completely quenched by Cu-TCPP nanosheets while that of dsDNA/SG complex wouldn't be affected. Thus, the sensor produced negligible background signals. It can produce 7.5-fold improved S/N compared to a graphene oxide (GO)-based FRET aptasensor. Chloramphenicol (CAP) was chosen as the model analyte to demonstrate the feasibility of the sensor system. The detection range is broad from 0.001 to 10 ng mL(-1) with a detection limit down to 0.3 pg mL(-1). The proposed assay was label free and can be used in homogenous detection which greatly simplifies the complexity of operations. The strategy opens a new way to develop sensitive, in-situ and simple assay for antibiotics in foods. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Sample preparation from complex matrixes with minute DNA content could highly benefit from the miniaturization of solid phase extraction (SPE) based devices due to an increased surface area-to-volume ratio. However, the adaptation of "bench-top" based protocols for DNA purification to miniaturized devices is not as straightforward as it might seem, and several issues need to be considered. A careful evaluation of DNA extraction and purification protocols needs to be performed, taking into account the complexity of such samples, and in order to facilitate the integration with the subsequent step, normally DNA amplification. In this work a washable and reusable miniaturized device for DNA purification based on microscale solid phase extraction (mu SPE), containing a commercial disposable silica membrane as the solid phase for DNA capture, was developed. The DNA purification protocol was firstly optimized by testing a set of different conditions, including buffer composition in all three steps of analysis and incubation during the elution step, with the objective of increasing the DNA yield and facilitating the integration in a miniaturized setting. This protocol was then tested with olive oil samples, including a pretreatment step also developed and optimized in this work. DNA analysis of olive oil samples is of high interest for the detection of fraudulent adulteration with oil from other seeds and for cultivar identification. The results were compared with the commercial NucleoSpin (R) Food kit regarding efficiency and purity of the DNA extract, by estimating the DNA yield and evaluating the absorbance ratios A260/280 and A260/230.

AB An enhanced cleanup efficiency hydroxy functionalized-magnetic graphene oxide (EH-Mag-GO) fully covered porous nano-titania as coating has been designed and synthesized. It has been evaluated in PRiME (process, robustness, improvements, matrix effects, ease of use) pass-through cleanup procedure for human plasma prior to analysis of strychnine and brucine by liquid chromatography-tandem quadrupole mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Comparing with the magnetic carboxyl-graphene (Mag-CG), EH-Mag-GO is much more effective for the removal of matrix effect resulted from blood phospholipids. Under optimal conditions, the results show higher cleanup efficiency of EH-Mag-GO with recoveries in the range of 89.4%-118%. The limits of quantification (LOQs) for strychnine and brucine are 0.088 mu g/L and 0.092 mu g/L, respectively. Especially, the EH-Mag-GO is also evaluated for reuse (20 times) without much sacrifice of the cleanup efficiency. Validation results on linearity, specificity, accuracy and precision, as well as on the application to analysis of strychnine and brucine in six cases of suspected semen strychni poisoning demonstrate the applicability to clinical studies.

AB A solvent-free method based on solid-phase microextraction (SPME) followed by gas chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (GC-MS/MS) has been developed for the simultaneous determination of eleven fungicides at trace levels in different types of waters. Several experimental SPME parameters such as temperature, fibre coating, and SPME mode, were optimized in order to obtain the highest extraction efficiency. Under the optimal conditions, 100 degrees C, polyacrilate fibre (PA) and direct-immersion mode, the method was validated showing good linearity, repeatability and reproducibility. Recovery studies were carried out in four different real water matrices and at three concentration levels (20, 200 and 2000 ng L-1), with overall recovery values between 92 and 104% and relative standard deviations (RSD) about 10%. Limits of detection (LODs) at the low ng L-1 were obtained. The method demonstrated its suitability for the determination of fungicides in real water samples using external calibration for quantification purposes as well as for photodegradation studies at low concentration levels.

AB Although electrospray ionization (ESI) remains the gold standard ionization source for LC-MS, it exhibits two main limitations: the occurrence of matrix effects and the limited ionization coverage towards nonpolar compounds. Dielectric barrier discharge ionization (DBDI) has gained attraction in recent years as a versatile ionization method in different applications and formats. Here, we report a thorough evaluation of DBDI as ionization interface for LC-MS, which reveals attractive advantages over ESI and atmospheric pressure chemical ionization (APCI) provided its singular ionization mechanism versatility. A suite of 80 pesticides across a wide range of physicochemical properties were selected and the results were compared with both ESI and APCI sources. Using a helium plasma operated in homogeneous regime with square-wave AC waveform and relatively low voltages (2.5 kV), not only DBDI was able to ionize compounds only amenable so far by GC-MS (eg. organochlorine species), but also offered a competitive performance in terms of sensitivity when contrasted with the commercial electrospray ionization source under equivalent conditions. Unlike ESI, DBDI mechanism occurs in the gas-phase, so the method is less affected by liquid-phase surface phenomena that yield ion suppression in ESI. Data collected in the positive ion mode revealed negligible matrix effect values (< 10% suppression) for most of the studied compounds in different complex matrix extracts such as wastewater, orange or olive oil. This is also consistent with the absence of adduct formation whereas with ESI source, Na adduct formation is quite common with these species. In general, both sensitivity and average limits of quantitation for DBDI were similar to those obtained by ESI and better than APCI. Results showed that analyte coverage with DBDI is enhanced with respect to ESI and APCI sources being able to effectively analyze organochlorine compounds. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The study of physical and chemical properties of a microscopic object, such as a single particle, is made possible using optical trapping (OT) technology combined with other measuring techniques. Here we show a universal optical trap combined with Raman spectroscopy (RS) and microscopy imaging for single-particle studies. The universal optical trap is constructed using two counter-propagating hollow beams and is able to stably levitate single particles of a wide range of properties, such as transparent or absorbing materials, organic (polymers, bioaerosols, etc.) or inorganic constituents (carbon, silica, glass, etc.), and spherical or irregularly shaped morphologies. Both physical and chemical properties and their temporal evolution of the trapped particle can be characterized simultaneously using the integrated OT-RS and imaging system. We created three sample cases to demonstrate the analytical merits of the system: (I) a single particle with no change, (II) partially degraded over the measuring period, and (III) one part from the fragmentized single particle. The particles' chemical compositions, crystalline states, etc. are inferred from their Raman spectra, while their physical properties (sizes, shapes, morphologies, etc.) are revealed by images. This integrated OT-RS system provides a new approach to concurrently characterize and monitor physical and chemical properties of single micrometer-sized objects optically trapped in air.

AB Herein, a novel colorimetric aptasensor was introduced for detection of cocaine based on the formation of three-way junction pockets on the surfaces of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) and the catalytic activity of the surfaces of AuNPs. Simplicity and detection of cocaine in a short time (only 35 min) are some of the unique features of the proposed sensing strategy. In the presence of cocaine, triple-fragment aptamer (TFA) forms on the surfaces of AuNPs, leading to a significant decrease of the catalytic activity of AuNPs and the color of samples remains yellow. In the absence of target, TFA does not form on the surfaces of AuNPs and 4-Nitrophenol, as a colorimetric agent, has more access to the surfaces of AuNPs, resulting in the reduction of 4-Nitrophenol and the color of sample changes from yellow to colorless. The sensing strategy showed good specificity, a limit of detection (LOD) of 440 pM and a dynamic range over 2-100 nM. The sensing method was also successfully applied to detect cocaine in spiked human serum samples with recovery of 94.71-98.63%. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Profenofos, a highly poisonous organophosphorus pesticide, has been widely used in agricultural production. These pesticide residues have seriously influenced food security and threatened human health, and new methods with high sensitivity are greatly needed to detect profenofos. Here, we developed an aptamer-based microcantilever-array sensor operated in stress mode to detect profenofos, with advantages of being a label-free, highly sensitive, one-step immobilization method capable of quantitative and real-time detection. The microcantilevers were functionalized with a profenofos-specific aptamer (SS2-55), and then the specific binding of profenofos to aptamer induced a deflection of the microcantilever, which was monitored using an optical method in a real-time manner. The microcantilever deflection showed a positive relationship with profenofos concentration, and the detection limit was low to 1.3 ng mL(-1) (3.5 nM) for profenofos, which was much lower than other aptamer-based detection methods. The selectivity of the sensor was verified with another organophosphorus pesticide. Additionally, we successfully detected profenofos dissolved in vegetable-soak solution. Our results showed that this aptamer-based microcantilever-array sensor is a convenient and label-free method for detecting profenofos in small amounts and has great potential for food-security applications.

AB There have been many efforts to search for affordable and efficient cosmetic ingredients from natural sources and to evaluate their bioactivities using eco-responsible tools. Hyaluronidase, elastase and collagenase are responsible for the degradation of the main components of the extracellular matrix, namely the hyaluronic acid, elastin and collagen, respectively. The aim of this work was to develop a single capillary electrophoresis method to monitor simultaneously the activities of these three enzymes, without reactant immobilization or radioactivity use. The developed approach was used to evaluate the bioactivity of the red alga Jania rubens after microwave- or electrochemical-assisted extraction. For this purpose, the incubation time, the reactant concentrations, the separation buffer and the detection system were carefully chosen. CE with double detection system, LIF and HRMS connected in series, was used to ensure the simultaneous analysis of the substrates and products of the three enzymatic reactions. The optimized enzymatic conditions allowed the use of the same protocol to assess the 3 enzyme activities. These conditions consisted of 10 min pre-incubation of the enzyme (with alga extract) at 37 degrees C; 10 min incubation with the substrate at 37 degrees C and 10 min stop-time at 90 degrees C. 1.4 nL of each reaction mixture were co-injected into a 85 cm total length capillary using short-end injection. Ammonium acetate (50mM, pH 9.0) was used for electrophoretic separation. All substrates and products were simultaneously detected in less than 10 min with good peak symmetry and efficiency, sufficient intra-day and inter-day repeatabilities (RSD < 4.5%; n = 3) and excellent LOQ (< 5 nM). The results obtained using this multiple CE-based enzymatic assay showed the significant effect of Jania rubens ethanolic extracts on elastase, hyaluronidase and the metalloproteinase MMP-1.

AB Many biological studies seek to confirm the effect of a treatment on the levels of chemical markers in biological tissues. This requires choosing the analytical method best able to detect the difference between basal levels and those found after treatment. We propose a new approach to calculate a criterion we call the 'discrimination threshold' (DT), and we applied it to an analytical method that we developed to determine cortisol in cattle plasma to detect stress. DT is derived from the measurement uncertainty (MU), and combines the variabilities of both the analytical method and the marker. The uncertainty of the analytical method comes from the method validation study. The marker variability (here cortisol) is modeled from a literature review. The graphical representation of DT allows estimating the applicability of the method. Our analytical method is shown to perform well when the difference in blood cortisol exceeds 18 ng.mL(-1).

AB Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is widely used in analytical chemistry, to reduce the dimensionality of a multivariate data set in a few Principal Components (PCs) that summarize the predominant patterns in the data. An accurate estimate of the number of PCs is indispensable to provide meaningful interpretations and extract useful information. We show how existing estimates for the number of PCs may fall short for datasets with considerable coherence, noise or outlier presence. We present here how Angle Distribution of the Loading Subspaces (ADLS) can be used to estimate the number of PCs based on the variability of loading subspace across bootstrap resamples. Based on comprehensive comparisons with other well-known methods applied on simulated dataset, we show that ADLS (1) may quantify the stability of a PCA model with several numbers of PCs simultaneously; (2) better estimate the appropriate number of PCs when compared with the cross-validation and scree plot methods, specifically for coherent data, and (3) facilitate integrated outlier detection, which we introduce in this manuscript. We, in addition, demonstrate how the analysis of different types of real-life spectroscopic datasets may benefit from these advantages of ADLS. (C) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Background: High-throughput simultaneous quantitative and qualitative (Quan/Qual) analysis is attractive to combine targeted with non-targeted analysis, e.g. in pharmacometabolomics and drug metabolism studies. This study aimed to investigate the possibilities and limitations of high-throughput Quan/Qual analysis by ultra-high performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC) coupled with high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS), to develop a widely applicable Quan/Qual UHPLC-HRMS method and to provide recommendations for Quan/Qual method development.
   Methods: A widely applicable 4.25-min UHPLC method for small-molecules was used to investigate and optimize mass spectrometric parameters of a Synapt G2S for Quan/Qual analysis. The method was applied on a rat metabolomics study investigating the effect of the fasting state and administration of a dosing vehicle on the rat plasma metabolic profile.
   Results: Highly important parameters for high-throughput Quan/Qual analysis were the scan mode and scan rate. A negative correlation was found between the amount of qualitative information that a method can provide and its quantitative performance (accuracy, precision, sensitivity, linear dynamic range). The optimal balance was obtained using the MSE scan mode with a short scan time of 30 ms. This 4.25-min Quan/Qual analysis method enabled quantification with accuracy and precision values <= 20% at the lowest quality control (QC) level and <= 15% at higher QC levels for 16 out of 19 tested analytes. It provided both parent m/z values and fragmentation spectra for compound identification with limited loss of chromatographic resolution and it revealed biologically relevant metabolites in its application to the metabolomics study.
   Conclusion: Quan/Qual method development requires balancing between the amount of qualitative data, the quality of the quantitative data and the analysis time. Recommendations are provided for MS resolution, scan mode, scan rate, smoothing and peak integration in Quan/Qual method development and analysis. (C) 2018 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB A simple protocol was developed to measure seawater calcium carbonate saturation states (Omega(spec)) spectrophotometrically. Saturation states are typically derived from the separate measurement of two other carbon system parameters, with each requiring unique instrumentation and often complex measurement protocols. Using the new protocol, the only required equipment is a thermostatted laboratory spectrophotometer. For each seawater sample, spectrophotometric measurements of pH (visible absorbance) are made in paired optical cells, one with and one without added nitric acid. Ultraviolet absorbance is measured to determine the amount of added acid based on the direct proportionality between nitrate concentration and UV absorbance. Coupled measurements of pH and the alkalinity change that accompanies the nitric acid addition allow calculation of a seawater sample's original carbonate ion concentration and saturation state. These paired absorbance measurements yield Omega(spec) (and other carbonate system parameters), with each sample requiring about 12 min processing time. Initially, an instrument-specific nitrate molar absorptivity coefficient must be determined (due to small but significant discrepancies in instrumental wavelength calibrations), but thereafter no further calibration is needed. In this work, the 1 sigma precision of replicate measurements of aragonite saturation state was found to be 0.020, and the average difference between Omega(spec) and Omega calculated conventionally from measured total alkalinity and pH (Omega(calc)) was -0.11%+/- 0.96% (a level of accuracy comparable to that obtained from spectrophotometric measurements of carbonate ion concentration). Over the entire range of experimental conditions, 0.97 < Omega < 3.17 (n = 125), all measurements attained the Global Ocean Acidification Observing Network's "weather level" goal for accuracy and 90% attained the more stringent "climate level" goal. When Omega(spec) was calculated from averages of duplicate samples (n = 56), the precision improved to 0.014 and the average difference between Omega(spec) and Omega(calc) improved to -0.11%+/- 0.73%. Additionally, 97% of the duplicate-based Omega(spec) measurements attained the "climate level" accuracy goal. These results indicate that the simple measurement protocol developed in this work should be widely applicable for monitoring fundamental seawater changes associated with ocean acidification.

AB An ultra-sensitive strategy for bisphenol A (BPA) detection based on dual enzyme-free strategies: hybridization chain reaction (HCR) and enzyme-strand recycling reaction has been developed. The BPA aptamer can form hairpins structure by the partly self-complementary sequence. In the presence of BPA, the released BPA aptamer sequence can trigger the HCR between two hairpins to from a long nicked double-helix DNA. The tails of hairpins on the duplex DNA were closely enough to hybridize with molecular beacon (MB) on the gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) to circularly cleave the loop of MB, leading to a "turn-on" fluorescent signal. This method exhibited high sensitivity for BPA detection in a linear rang from 0.2 to 1000 pM with 0.05 pM of limit of detection. Moreover, it was successfully used for BPA detection in real water samples. Importantly, this method was simple without complex enzymatic procedure and high cost, showing a promising future for on-site detection of BPA in practical application. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB A new aerosol sampler based on the original version of Aerosol Counterflow Two-Jets Unit (ACTJU) is described. The ACTJU collector, connected with a water-based Condensation Growth Unit (CGU) placed upstream of the ACTJU, accomplished the quantitative collection of fine and ultrafine aerosol particles down to a few nanometers in diameter. Condensation of water vapor in the CGU enlarges nanometer sized particles to larger sizes in the supermicrometer range and the formed droplets are then collected into water in the ACTJU collector.
   The continuous collection of aerosols with the CGU-ACTJU sampler allows for the time-resolved measurement of changes in the concentration of particulate constituents. Coupling of the CGU-ACTJU sampler with on-line detection devices allows in-situ automated analysis of water-soluble aerosol components with high time resolution of 1 s (e.g., FIA detection for nitrite or nitrate) or 1 h (e.g., IC detection with preconcentration step for inorganic anions). Under the optimum conditions (the air flow rate of 10 L min(-1) and water flow rate of 1.5 mL min(-1)), the limit of detection (IC including the preconcentration) for particulate fluoride, chloride, nitrite, nitrate, sulphate and phosphate is 2.53, 6.64, 24.2, 16.8, 0.12 and 5.03 ng m(-3), respectively. The apparatus is sufficiently robust for its application at routine monitoring of aerosol composition in real-time. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In the analysis of biological samples, control over experimental design and data acquisition procedures alone cannot ensure well-conditioned H-1 NMR spectra with maximal information recovery for data analysis. A third major element affects the accuracy and robustness of results: the data pre-processing/pre-treatment for which not enough attention is usually devoted, in particular in metabolomic studies. The usual approach is to use proprietary software provided by the analytical instruments' manufacturers to conduct the entire pre-processing strategy. This widespread practice has a number of advantages such as a user-friendly interface with graphical facilities, but it involves non-negligible drawbacks: a lack of methodological information and automation, a dependency of subjective human choices, only standard processing possibilities and an absence of objective quality criteria to evaluate pre-processing quality. This paper introduces PepsNMR to meet these needs, an R package dedicated to the whole processing chain prior to multivariate data analysis, including, among other tools, solvent signal suppression, internal calibration, phase, baseline and misalignment corrections, bucketing and normalisation. Methodological aspects are discussed and the package is compared to the gold standard procedure with two metabolomic case studies. The use of PepsNMR on these data shows better information recovery and predictive power based on objective and quantitative quality criteria. Other key assets of the package are workflow processing speed, reproducibility, reporting and flexibility, graphical outputs and documented routines. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Systematic variation of the instrument's response both within- and between-batches is frequently observed in untarget LC-MS metabolomics involving the analysis of a large number of samples. The so-called batch effect decreases the statistical power and has a negative impact on repeatability and reproducibility of the results. As there is no standard way of assessing or correcting LC-MS batch effects and there is no single method providing optimal results in all situations, the selection of the optimal approach is not trivial.
   This work explores the effectiveness of a set of tools for batch effect assessment. Qualitative tools include the monitoring of spiked internal standards, principal component analysis and hierarchical cluster analysis. Quantitative tools comprise the distribution of RSDQC values, the median Pearson correlation coefficient in QCs, the ratio of random features in QCs using the runs test, as well as multivariate tools such as the d-statistic, Silhouette plots, Principal Variance Component Analysis and the expected technical variation in the prediction. Results show that qualitative and quantitative approaches are complementary and that by limiting the analysis to QCs the power to detect and evaluate both within and between batch effects is increased. Besides, the graphical integration of outputs from multiple quantitative tools facilitates the evaluation of batch effects and it is proposed as a straightforward way for comparing and tailoring batch effect elimination approaches.

AB Amadori compounds are an important family of chemical species with high values in the quality control and research of food and tobacco products as well as disease diagnosis. Since they are present in a large population with close structure and nature, recognition of specific Amadori compounds from complex sample matrices presents a challenging task. Particularly, few reagents or materials that can recognize specific Amadori compounds have been reported. In this study, we synthesized molecularly imprinted mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MIMSNs) that can highly specifically recognize and efficiently extract an Amadori compound of interest from complex samples. N-(1-deoxy-D-glucose-1-yl) tryptophan (Glc-Trp), a typical Amadori compound, was used as the template and target compound. The prepared MIMSNs exhibited excellent binding properties. The cross-reactivity was only 2.9-4.8% towards interfering analogs. The binding constant and binding capacity towards the target were 66 mu M and 45 mmol/g, respectively. The imprinting approach showed outstanding imprinting effect, giving an imprinting factor of 119.4. Through combining MIMSNs-based extraction with electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) and capillary electrography (CE), a targeted analysis approach was established and demonstrated to be an efficient platform for identification and determination of Glc-Trp from cigarette sample.

AB An automated bundled hollow fiber array (BHF)-liquid-phase microextraction (LPME) methodology in combination with ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS) has been developed for the determination of perfluorinated compounds (PFCs) in environmental aqueous matrices. Eight PFCs were considered, including perfluoroheptanoic acid, perfluorooctanoic acid, perfluorononanoic acid, perfluorodecanoic acid, perfluoroundecanoic acid, perfluorododecanoic acid, perfluorotridecanoic acid, perfluorotetradecanoic acid. Experimental parameters influencing extraction efficiency, such as number of hollow fibers in the BHF extraction device, type of extraction and desorption solvent, extraction conditions (stirring rate, temperature and duration), elution conditions and the salting out effect were examined. Under the most favourable conditions, enrichment factors of between 9 and 40 were achieved for the target compounds when extracting from 10 mL of sample. Good intra and inter-day precision were obtained with relative standard deviations of less than 12%. The linearity range investigated was between 5 and 10,000 ng L-1, with coefficients of determination (r(2)) >= 0.991. The developed method was applied for the UHPLC-MS/MS determination of environmental PFCs in industrial water discharge samples. The automation of BHF-LPME together with UHPLC-MS/MS rendered the method efficient, rapid and sensitive to determine PFCs, with the possibility of on-site real-time monitoring of contaminants in environmental waters.

AB There is a critical need to better understand the patterns, levels and combinatory effects of exposures we are facing through our diet and environment. Mycotoxin mixtures are of particular concern due to chronic low dose exposures caused by naturally contaminated food. To facilitate new insights into their role in chronic disease, mycotoxins and their metabolites are quantified in bio-fluids as biomarkers of exposure. Here, we describe a highly sensitive urinary assay based on ultra-high performance liquid chromatography -tandem mass spectrometer (UHPLC-MS/MS) and C-13-labelled or deuterated internal standards covering the most relevant regulated and emerging mycotoxins. Utilizing enzymatic pretreatment, solid phase extraction and UHPLC separation, the sensitivity of the method was significantly higher (10-160x lower LODs) than in a previously described method used for comparison purpose, and stable isotopes provided compensation for challenging matrix effects. This method was in-house validated and applied to re-assess mycotoxin exposure in urine samples obtained from Nigerian children, adolescent and adults, naturally exposed through their regular diet. Owing to the methods high sensitivity, biomarkers were detected in all samples. The mycoestrogen zearalenone was the most frequently detected contaminant (82%) but also ochratoxin A (76%), aflatoxin M-1 (73%) and fumonisin B-1 (71%) were quantified in a large share of urines. Overall, 57% of 120 urines were contaminated with both, aflatoxin M-1 and fumonisin B-1, and other co-exposures were frequent. These results clearly demonstrate the advanced performance of the method to assess lowest background exposures (pg mL(-1) range) using a single, highly robust assay that will allow for the systematic investigation of low dose effects on human health.

AB As a new class of L-cysteine electrocatalyst explored in this study, Au/CeO2 composite nanofibers (CNFs) were employed to modify the screen printed carbon electrode (SPCE) to fabricate a novel L-cysteine (CySH) electrochemical sensor with high performance. Its electrochemical behavior and the roles of Au and CeO2 in the composite toward electro-oxidation of CySH were elucidated and demonstrated using cyclic voltammetry and amperometry techniques for the first time through the comparison with pure CeO2 NFs. More specifically, the Au/CeO2 CNFs modified SPCE possessed greatly enhanced electrocatalytic activity toward CySH oxidation. An ultra high sensitivity of 321 mu A mM(-1) cm(-2) was obtained, which is almost 2.7 times higher than that of pure CeO2 NFs, revealing that the presence of Au imposed an important influence on the electrocatalytic activity toward CySH. The detailed reasons on such high performance were also discussed. In addition, the as-prepared sensor showed a low detection limit of 10 nM (signal to noise ratio of 3), a wide linear range up to 200 mu M for the determination of CySH, an outstanding reproducibility and good long-term stability, as well as an excellent selectivity against common interferents such as tryptophan, tyrosine, methionine, ascorbic acid and uric acid. All these features indicate that the Au/CeO2 composite nanofiber is a promising candidate as a new class of L-cysteine electrocatalyst in the development of highly sensitive and selective CySH electrochemical sensor.

AB Development of an efficient method for the simultaneous detection of two highly concerning mycotoxins, ochratoxin A (OTA) and aflatoxin B1 (AFB1), is of great significance on food safety monitoring. Herein, a magnetically controlled fluorescence aptasensor for simultaneous determination of OTA and AFB1 has been successfully developed. The working principle of the aptasensor is based on the specific aptamer-mycotoxin recognition and further leads to the partial release of two distinguishable fluorescence labels from the magnetic carriers. Through the magnetic separation, the reporter probes in the supernatant solution can be collected and converted into a sensitive fluorescence signal with dual emission peaks. This aptasensor provided a wide detection range of 2 pg mL(-1) - 5 ng mL(-1) for OTA and 5 pg mL(-1) - 10 ng mL(-1) for AFB1. The new easy-to-wash and simple-to-use approach offers a simultaneous and high selective detection with high sensitivity (limits of detection of 0.67 and 1.70 pg mL(-1) for OTA and AFB1, respectively). Remarkable accuracy (relative standard deviation <5.6%) during the mycotoxins determination as well as excellent quantitative recoveries (95-108%) during the analysis of the spiked corn samples were also achieved. This simple aptasensing scheme provides a new avenue for high throughput screen of dual mycotoxins due to its simple manipulation, short assay times, high selectivity and sensitivity.

AB Atomic fluorescence spectrometry (AFS), as one of the common atomic spectrometric techniques with high sensitivity, simple instrumentation, and low acquisition and running cost, has been widely used in various fields for trace elemental analysis, notably the determination of hydride-forming elements by hydride generation atomic fluorescence spectrometry (HG-AFS). In recent years, the soaring demand of field analysis has significantly promoted the miniaturization of analytical atomic spectrometers or at least instrumental components. Various techniques have also been developed to approach the goal of portable/ miniaturized AFS instrumentation for field analysis. In this review, potentially portable/ miniaturized AFS techniques, primarily involving advanced instrumental components and whole instrumentation with references since 2000, are summarized and discussed. The discussion mainly includes five aspects: radiation source, atomizer, detector, sample introduction, and miniaturized atomic fluorescence spectrometer/system. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB Metal oxide semiconductor (MOX) sensors are usually temperature-modulated and calibrated with multivariate models such as partial least squares (PLS) to increase the inherent low selectivity of this technology. The multivariate sensor response patterns exhibit heteroscedastic and correlated noise, which suggests that maximum likelihood methods should outperform PLS. One contribution of this paper is the comparison between PLS and maximum likelihood principal components regression (MLPCR) in MOX sensors. PLS is often criticized by the lack of interpretability when the model complexity increases beyond the chemical rank of the problem. This happens in MOX sensors due to cross-sensitivities to interferences, such as temperature or humidity and non-linearity. Additionally, the estimation of fundamental figures of merit, such as the limit of detection (LOD), is still not standardized in multivariate models. Orthogonalization methods, such as orthogonal projection to latent structures (O-PLS), have been successfully applied in other fields to reduce the complexity of PLS models. In this work, we propose a LOD estimation method based on applying the well-accepted univariate LOD formulas to the scores of the first component of an orthogonal PLS model. The resulting LOD is compared to the multivariate LOD range derived from error-propagation. The methodology is applied to data extracted from temperature-modulated MOX sensors (FIS SB-500-12 and Figaro TGS 3870-A04), aiming at the detection of low concentrations of carbon monoxide in the presence of uncontrolled humidity (chemical noise). We found that PLS models were simpler and more accurate than MLPCR models. Average LOD values of 0.79 ppm (FIS) and 1.06 ppm (Figaro) were found using the approach described in this paper. These values were contained within the LOD ranges obtained with the error-propagation approach. The mean LOD increased to 1.13 ppm (FIS) and 1.59 ppm (Figaro) when considering validation samples collected two weeks after calibration, which represents a 43% and 46% degradation, respectively. The orthogonal score-plot was a very convenient tool to visualize MOX sensor data and to validate the LOD estimates. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Monoclonal antibody (mAb) drugs have generated much interest in recent years for treating various diseases. Immunoglobulin G (IgG) represents a high percentage of mAb drugs that have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). To facilitate therapeutic drug monitoring and pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic studies, we developed a general liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method to quantify the concentration of IgG-based mAbs in human plasma. Three IgG-based drugs (bevacizumab, nivolumab and pembrolizumab) were selected to demonstrate our method. Protein G beads were used for sample pretreatment due to their universal ability to trap IgG-based drugs. Surrogate peptides that were obtained after trypsin digestion were quantified by using LC-MS/MS. To calibrate sample preparation errors and matrix effects that occur during LC-MS/MS analysis, we used two internal standards (IS) method that include the IgG-based drug-IS tocilizumab and post-column infused IS. Using two internal standards was found to effectively improve quantification accuracy, which was within 15% for all mAb drugs that were tested at three different concentrations. This general method was validated in term of its precision, accuracy, linearity and sensitivity for 3 demonstration mAb drugs. The successful application of the method to clinical samples demonstrated its' applicability in clinical analysis. It is anticipated that this general method could be applied to other mAb-based drugs for use in precision medicine and clinical studies. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Genome editing techniques have been implemented in human daily lives, which has created a high demand for the development of new gene-edited product analysis methods. Conventional assays are time-consuming, labor-intensive, and costly. This paper proposes a rapid and low-cost strategy for detecting genome-editing induced deletion which works by integrating rapid-multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) with a dual-lateral flow nucleic acid biosensor (LFNAB) cascade in a single-copy case. A rapid-MLPA was first introduced to the LFNAB system as a replacement for the conventional PCR for enhanced specificity and accuracy. A dual-LFNAB was applied for the detection of genome-editing induced deletion without any additional instrumentation or complex operation. After optimization, we achieved the specific detection of wildtype alleles and deletion alleles in spiked samples with a detection limit of 0.4 fM, which is comparable to that of electrophoresis-based detection assays and fluorescent biosensors. To confirm the validity and feasibility of our strategy, we assayed two pork samples from two WUZHISHAN pigs successfully. By comparing the detection results from next-generation sequencing analysis, we found that the proposed cascade demonstrates at least 20-fold shorter assay time and at least 100-fold less assay cost. To this effect, the proposed method is a rapid and low-cost solution to sample-to-answer detection of genome-editing induced deletion and shows remarkable potential in regards to international trade, transparency, and freedom of choice.

AB A novel kind of hybrid monolith with well-defined mesopore structure was prepared based on sol-gel condensation of 1, 2-bis(trimethoxysilyl) ethane (BTME) and tetramethoxysilane. Compared with terminal organosiloxanes used for preparation of conventional hybrid monoliths, BTME, as an ethanebridged alkoxysilane precursor, could not only maintain the uniformity of pore size distribution, but also improve the chemical stability of the monolith via Si-C bonds in the framework. Owing to the controllable mesoporous structure and good stability, the monolithic column was used for the separation of peptides with half peak width less than 6 s and the run-to-run and column-to-column relative standard deviations (RSD) for the retention time of five standard peptides less than 2.5%, showing narrow peak width and good reproducibility. Moreover, the separation performance could be well maintained even after washed by the mobile phase with pH 11.0 at 50 degrees C. Furthermore, 100 cm-length monolithic column was prepared and successfully used for nanoRPLC-ESI-MS/MS analysis of HeLa cell lysate digests, and 5670 proteins corresponding to 37574 peptides were identified from 750 ng of the sample, showing great promising of "single-shot" large-scale in-depth proteomic research.

AB Argentation chromatography is widely used nowadays as a powerful tool to separate complex mixtures of analytes containing unsaturated and/or aromatic fragments. Here we present the results of chromatographic and computational studies on a silver-thiolate stationary phase, in which the silver metal is covalently bonded to mercaptopropyl silica particles. The exceptionally high selectivity displayed by this organometallic moiety prompted us to deeply investigate its molecular recognition properties. The interactions of the silver atom with a series of benzene derivatives was investigated to gain information on the mechanism by which the different ring substituents modulate retention factors and selectivity. The experimental trend was fully rationalized by means of quantum-mechanical Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations, which allowed us to elucidate the chromatographic results in the light of unusual and unexpected substituent effects.

AB Applicability of single-particle inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (sp-ICP-MS) using dwell times equal to or shorter than 100 mu s has been tested for assessing titanium dioxide nanoparticles (TiO2 NPs) in bivalve mollusks. TiO2 NPs isolation from fresh mollusk tissues was achieved by ultrasound assisted enzymatic hydrolysis procedure using a pancreatin/lipase mixture. Optimum extraction conditions imply ultrasonication (60% amplitude) for 10 min, and 7.5 mL of a solution containing 3.0 g L-1 of pancreatin and lipase (pH 7.4). The developed method was found to be repeatable (repeatability of 17% for the over-all procedure, TiO2 NPs concentration of 5.33 x 10(7) +/- 8.89 x 10(6), n = 11), showing a limit of detection of 5.28 x 10(6) NPs g(-1), and a limit of detection in size of 24.4-30.4 nm, based on the 3 sigma criteria, and on the 3 sigma/5 sigma criteria, respectively. The analytical recovery within the 90-99% range (use of TiO2 NPs standards of 50 nm at 7 and 14 mu g L-1 as Ti). Several bivalve mollusks (clams, cockles, mussels, razor clams, oysters and variegated scallops) were analyzed for total titanium (ICP-MS after microwave assisted acid digestion), and for TiO2 NPs by the proposed method. TiO2 NPs concentrations were within the 2.36 x 10(7)-1.25 x 10(8) NPs g(-1) range, and the most frequent sizes were from 50 to 70 nm. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A novel application of nanofiber polymers in the wide area of a sample preparation techniques known as solid phase extraction has been studied. We demonstrated application of nanofibers as sorbents for use in a system including on-line extraction coupled with column-switching high performance liquid chromatography. Four types of nanofibers including polyamide 6 with two different surface densities, poly(epsilon-caprolactone), and polystyrene were tested. We found that three of them were very efficient extraction sorbents sufficiently stable for application in the on-line system. Our results confirmed that the extraction efficiency of the nanofibers depended on the type and chemistry of the spun polymer as well as on the fabrication process of the nanofibrous mats that affected their density, structure, surface density, and mechanical functionality. We also compared performance of all four nanofibers with a conventional monolithic reversed-phase C18 sorbent in terms of extraction efficiency using on-line solid-phase extraction-HPLC system. Polyamide 6 was found to be the best sorbent for lipophilic analytes with a retention and extraction efficiency for the target analytes comparable with that of the C18 monolith.

AB The aim of this work was to prepare and evaluate molecularly imprinted polymers obtained by a sol-gel approach for the selective solid-phase extraction (SPE) of organophosphorus pesticides (OPs) from almond oil. The performances of molecularly imprinted silicas (MISs), prepared using different conditions of synthesis, were studied by applying different extraction procedures in order to determine the ability of the MISs to selectively extract ten target OPs. For this, the retention of OPs on MISs in pure media was compared with the retention on a non-imprinted silicas (NISs), used as control sorbent, to prove the presence of specific cavities. The most promising MIS allowed the selective extraction of the 3 most polar OPs among the 10 studied. The capacity was studied and the repeatability of the extraction recovery yield was demonstrated both in pure and real media. This MIS was able to selectively extract fenthion sulfoxide and dimethoate contained in almond oil extract after applying the optimized extraction procedure with recovery yields between 100 and 114%. The estimated limit of quantification (LOQ, S/N = 10), thanks to LC/MS analysis in MRM mode, between 1.2 and 4.6 mu g/kg for those OPs in the almond fruits, was more than 10 times lower than the Maximum Residue Levels (MRLs) established by the European Commission. This MIS therefore shows a high potential for the analysis of those two polar OPs at trace levels from almond oils. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Recent literature has demonstrated the utility of the organic-diffusive gradients in thin films (o-DGT) device as an effective passive sampler for polar organics in aquatic environments. Here, a new configuration comprising a polyacrylamide diffusive gel and Sepra (TM) ZT sorbent was developed and calibrated under multiple pH conditions. Linear uptake (r(2) > 0.9) was observed at pH approximate to 5 for a suite of 31 pharmaceuticals and pesticides over 25 days, suitable for typical passive sampler deployments. At pH approximate to 8.5, linear uptake (r(2) > 0.9) was observed for many of the same compounds. Comparisons of the uptake rates between the two pH experiments generally agreed (14% average relative error), with only 6 compounds exhibiting marked reduction with pH (e.g. sulfonamide antibiotics). These discrepancies may be explained by changes in analyte-sorbent interaction (H-bonding) due to speciation changes at varying pH. Samplers performed well in field evaluations conducted in an impacted river system, showing close agreement with the previously validated agarose/HLB o-DGT configuration deployed simultaneously. This work illustrates that polyacrylamide diffusive gels are a more robust and resistant outer-membrane material compared to agarose used in earlier o-DGT configurations. Sepra (TM) ZT binding gels served as an effective binding resin, offering a cost effective and commercially available sorbent. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This work presents a high-sensitivity approach to quantify ultra-trace concentrations of rare earth elements (REEs) in speleothem carbonates using open-cell laser ablation-sector field-inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (open-cell LA-SF-ICPMS). Specifically, open-cell LA in combination with a gas exchange device enabled sampling of large-scale carbonate specimens in an ambient environment. The use of a "jet" vacuum interface and the addition of small amounts of N-2 gas allowed for a 20-40 fold sensitivity enhancement compared to the conventional interface configuration. Mass load effects, quantification capabilities and detection power were investigated in analyses of reference materials using various combinations of spot sizes and laser repetition rates. From a 160 mm diameter circular laser spot and 10 Hz ablation frequency, limits of detection were in the low or sub-ng g(-1) range for REEs. Little dependence of Ca normalized sensitivity factors on the amount of material introduced into the plasma was observed. Relative deviations of quantified concentrations from USGS MACS-3 preferred values were smaller than 12%. The analytical approach enabled the determination of REE concentration profiles at the single digit ng g(-1) level. Application to a 15-cm piece stalagmite collected from East Timor revealed at least two abrupt elevations in light rare earth elements (LREEs) within a scanning distance of 8 mm. These anomaly regions extended over a distance of approximate to 200 mu m and showed LREE abundances elevated by at least one order of magnitude. This high-resolution open-cell LA-SF-ICPMS method has the potential to be applied in micro-domain analyses of other natural carbonates, such as travertine, tufa, and flowstones. This is promising for a better understanding of earth and environmental sciences. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Experimental human exposure studies are an effective tool to study adverse health effects from acute inhalation of particulate matter and other constituents of air pollution. In this randomized and double-blinded crossover study, we investigated the systemic effect on bioactive lipid metabolite levels after controlled biodiesel exhaust exposure of healthy humans and compared it to filtered air at a separate exposure occasion. Eicosanoids and other oxylipins, as well as endocannabinoids and related lipids, were quantified in plasma from 14 healthy volunteers at baseline and at three subsequent time points (2, 6, and 24 h) after 1 h exposure sessions. Protocols based on liquid chromatography (LC) coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) methods were developed to detect temporal changes in circulating levels after biodiesel exhaust exposure. The exhaust was generated by a diesel engine fed with an undiluted rapeseed methyl ester fuel. Among the 51 analyzed lipid metabolites, PGF(2 alpha), 9,10-DiHOME, 9-HODE, 5-HETE, 11-HETE, 12-HETE, and DEA displayed significant responsiveness to the biodiesel exhaust exposure as opposed to filtered air. Of these, 9-HODE and 5-HETE at 24 h survived the 10% false discovery rate cutoff (p < 0.003). Hence, the majority of the responsive lipid metabolites were monohydroxy fatty acids. We conclude that it is possible to detect alterations in circulating bioactive lipid metabolites in response to biodiesel exhaust exposure using LC-MS/MS, with emphasis on metabolites with inflammation related properties and implications on cardiovascular health and disease. These observations aid future investigations on air pollution effects, especially with regard to cardiovascular outcomes. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The use of paper-based methods for clinical diagnostics is a rapidly expanding research topic attracting a great deal of interest. Some groups have attempted to realize an integrated nucleic acid test on a single microfluidic paper chip, including extraction, amplification, and readout functions. However, these studies were not able to overcome complex modification and fabrication requirements, long turn-around times, or the need for sophisticated equipment like pumps, thermal cyclers, or centrifuges. Here, we report an extremely simple paper-based test for the point-of-care diagnosis of rotavirus A, one of the most common pathogens that causes pediatric gastroenteritis. This paper-based test could perform nucleic acid extraction within 5 min, then took 25 min to amplify the target sequence, and the result was visible to the naked eye immediately afterward or quantitative by the UV-Vis absorbance. This low-cost method does not require extra equipment and is easy to use either in a lab or at the point-of-care. The detection limit for rotavirus A was found to be 1 x 10(3) copies/mL. In addition, 100% sensitivity and specificity were achieved when testing 48 clinical stool samples. In conclusion, the present paper-based test fulfills the main requirements for a point-of-care diagnostic tool, and has the potential to be applied to disease prevention, control, and precision diagnosis.

AB In this study, a novel colorimetric aptasensor was prepared by coupling trivalent peroxidase-mimic DNAzyme and magnetic nanoparticles for highly sensitive and selective detection of target proteins. A three G-quadruplex (G4) DNA-hemin complex was employed as the trivalent peroxidase-mimic DNAzyme, in which hemin assisted the G4-DNA to fold into a catalytic conformation and act as an enzyme. The design of the aptasensor includes magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs), complementary DNA (cDNA) modified with biotin, and a label-free single strand DNA (ssDNA) including the aptamer and trivalent peroxidase-mimic DNAzyme. The trivalent DNAzyme, which has the highest catalytic activity among multivalent DNAzymes, catalyzed the H2O2-mediated oxidation of ABTS. The colorless ABTS was oxidized to produce a blue-green product that can be clearly distinguished by the naked eye. The aptamer and trivalent peroxidase-mimic DNAzyme promote the specificity and sensitivity of this detection method, which can be generalized for other targets by simply replacing the corresponding aptamers. To demonstrate the feasible use of the aptasensor for target detection, a well-known tumor biomarker MUC1 was evaluated as the model target. The limits of detection were determined to be 5.08 and 5.60 nM in a linear range of 50-1000 nM in a buffer solution and 10% serum system, respectively. This colorimetric and label-free aptasensor with excellent sensitivity and strong anti-interference ability has potential application in disease diagnoses, prognosis tracking, and therapeutic evaluation.

AB Mercury ion (Hg2+) is a highly hazardous and widespread pollutant with bio-accumulative properties. Although the existing Hg2+ detection methods have high sensitivity and reliability, whereas there have few reports concerning bimodal detection for Hg2+ with one sensor. Toward this goal, a novel sensor based on rhodamine derivatives (RhD) grafted AuNS@Ag core-shell nanocubes (CSN) has been synthesized and shown the bimodal detection capabilities with metal enhanced fluorescence (MEF) and surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) for Hg2+. Herein, resultant CSN acts as the signal enhancing material; RhD was modified on the outside of the shell to ensure the signal sensitive of the CSN-RhD hybrids. In this work, we investigate the size- and shape-dependent SERS activity of plasmonic CSN comprised of AuNS as cores and Ag cuboids as shells. The SERS activity of CSN with spherical core was found to increase with the increasing thickness of the Ag cubic shell. Sequel, under an optimized condition, a display of strong MEF and SERS signals of the resulting mixtures with increasing of Hg2+ concentrations was observed. The proposed bimodal sensor showed excellent performances for Hg2+ along with wide linear range of 0.001-1000 ppm and 0.01-1000 ppm as well as the relatively low detection limit of 0.94 and 5.16 ppb for MEF and SERS assays, respectively. Furthermore, the ability of the sensor to detect Hg2+ was also confirmed in adulterated milk samples. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Hypochlorous acid (HOCl), as an important reactive oxygen species (ROS), is involved with many pathological and physiological pathways, whereas many aspects of its roles remain unclear due to the lack of robust analytical methods. In this work, we report a novel kind of special reaction-based nanosensors, gold nanoparticles modified with newly synthesized 2-mercapto-4-methoxy-phenol molecules (AuNPs/MMP), to detect the endogenous HOCl in living cells according to the changes in the SERS spectrum of AuNPs/MMP resulting from the reaction of HOCl with MMP on AuNPs. These nanosensors can rapidly respond to HOCl within 1 min with the detection limit at 10(-7) M level. Furthermore, the nanosensors exhibit high selectivity for HOCl because of the specificity of the reaction combined with the fingerprinting capability of SERS. Consequently, the proposed SERS nanosensors are capable of monitoring and imaging the endogenous HOCl generated in a living macrophage under stimulation, showing great promise to be used for in-situ studies of the pathophysiological processes that involve HOCl.

AB Polymer monolithic column based on a green deep eutectic solvent (DES) was prepared for in-tube solid phase microextraction of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in aqueous samples. DES composed of choline chloride and itaconic acid was adopted as functional monomer to synthesize a polymeric monolith inside polydopamine-functionalized poly(ether ether ketone) (PEEK) tube. The obtained monolithic column was characterized with fourier transform infrared spectrometry, X-ray photoelectron spectrometer and field emission scanning electron microscope. An online SPME-HPLC method was developed by connecting the PEEK tube to the HPLC system. Parameters including sampling rate, desorption time, sample pH value and sample volume that can affect the performance of this method were investigated. Under the optimized conditions, the proposed SPME-HPLC method showed high extraction efficiency (enrichment factors about 100), good linearity (R >= 0.9997) and good reproducibility (relative standard deviation < 4.32%) for determination of three NSAIDs in aqueous solution. The limits of quantification were found to be in a range of 0.05-0.25 ng mL(-1). The SPME-HPLC method was also successfully applied to detect NSAIDs in lake water and human plasma samples.

AB Size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) with wide application in peptide analysis presents challenges in determination of molecular weight distribution due to the relatively low resolution. In this study, a stop-flow reversed phase liquid chromatography (RPLC) x SEC system was constructed, aiming at improving the peptide separation in SEC. As the chromatographic dispersion during stop-flow operation might contribute to the band broadening in the first dimension (1st D) RPLC, the effects of different stop-flow operational parameters on the additional band broadening were quantitatively evaluated. Unlike analytes of large molecular size or long retention time with low effective diffusion coefficient (D-eff), additional band broadening was evidently observed for analytes of small molecular size and short retention time (high D-eff). Therefore, optimal flow rate, low column temperature and short stop-flow time were suggested for analyzing small molecules of short retention time. The established stop-flow two-dimensional liquid chromatography (2D-LC) was further tested on protein hydrolysates. The resolution was evidently improved for both heart-cutting and comprehensive 2D-LC analysis (despite additional band broadening in RPLC). Compared with heart-cutting analysis with higher 1st D resolution for selective fractions, comprehensive analysis could provide more complete information about the molecular weight distribution of the eluting solutes along RPLC.

AB Column temperature control is a fundamental component of liquid chromatography experiments. However, it is typically monitored indirectly by tracking the temperature of an adjacent heating element that exchanges heat with the column in a controlled environment. The practice of not directly measuring the column temperature means that uncontrolled contributions of heat, such as frictional heating inside the column, can be overlooked. The present work describes the use of a high-resolution infrared thermal imaging camera to directly measure the column heat map during mobile phase flow. The approach was used to measure the longitudinal temperature gradient formed with three common mobile phases: water, methanol, and acetonitrile, in two 50 mm reversed-phase columns, a 1.7 mu m particle-packed column and a polystyrene divinylbenzene monolith. In a close approximation to an adiabatic environment, the temperature gradients (Delta T) observed with the 1.7 mu m particle column at a linear velocity of 5.8 mm/s were up to +16.6 and + 12.8 degrees C above an ambient temperature of 23 degrees C for water and acetonitrile, respectively. In the case of water, the measured temperature gradient values (Delta T) were within 1% difference of theoretically-calculated values and on average within 10% for acetonitrile. By contrast, the Delta T observed in the monolith was negligible. The elevated temperatures that are generated through friction in sub-2 mu m particle columns may be particularly important to consider for the design of experiments that measure structural features of temperature-sensitive analytes, such as biomolecules. While frictional heating is one important application of the thermal imaging approach described, the technique can be used to provide a data-rich profile of heat exchange in numerous experimental configurations, chromatographic or otherwise.

AB Lanthanide polymer-labelled antibodies were investigated to improve the analytical figures of merit of homogeneous immunoassays with inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) detection for multiplexed biomarker analysis in human serum samples. Specific monoclonal antibodies against four cancer biomarkers (CEA, sErbB2, CA 15.3 and CA 125) were labelled with different polymer-based lanthanide group to increase the number of metal labels per binding site. After the immunoreaction of the biomarkers with the specific antibodies, antigen-antibody complexes were separated by size-exclusion chromatography followed by ICP-MS detection. The polymer label could be loaded with 30-times more atoms of the lanthanide that the lanthanide-DOTA complex traditionally used for this purpose elsewhere [1] which resulted in a 10-fold improvement in both sensitivity and detection limits. Analytical figures of merit obtained with the lanthanide polymer labelling strategy make the detection of the biomarkers feasible below the threshold reference values used in clinical analysis. This labelling method was successfully validated by analyzing a control human serum spiked with the four biomarkers at three different concentration levels. For all the biomarkers studied, the recovery values ranged from 95% to 110% whereas interassay and intra-assay precision were lower than 8%. Results obtained with this approach were equivalent to those obtained by heterogenous-based immunoassays based on the detection by electro-chemiluminescence or ELISA. However, the method developed offers better analytical figures of merit using a smaller amount of sample. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Phosphorylated peptides are important for understanding the processes of biological regulation. However, the detection of phosphopeptides remains a challenge because of their low abundance and the suppression by non-phosphopeptides. Here, we report a strategy for the facile and rapid fabrication of TiO2-nanoparticle-packed microchannel-array glass microchips (TMA-microchips) for in-tube solid-phase microextraction (IT-SPME) using a plasma-assisted method for the precise alignment of the microstructure. This proposed strategy was applied to the selective enrichment of phosphopeptides from a protein digestion mixture, demonstrating the high capacity and selectivity of the SPME microchips. An important feature of this array design is that it fully exploits the advantage of nanoparticles for improving extraction capacity and simultaneously provides an effective way to reduce the pressure for driving solutions; thus, it paves the way for future methods that simultaneously take advantage of nanomaterials and microchips.

AB Microplastics can be present in the environment as manufactured microplastics (known as primary microplastics) or resulting from the continuous weathering of plastic litter, which yields progressively smaller plastic fragments (known as secondary microplastics). Herein, we discuss the numerous issues associated with the analysis of microplastics, and to a less extent of nanoplastics, in environmental samples (water, sediments, and biological tissues), from their sampling and sample handling to their identification and quantification. The analytical quality control and quality assurance associated with the validation of analytical methods and use of reference materials for the quantification of microplastics are also discussed, as well as the current challenges within this field of research and possible routes to overcome such limitations.

AB The field of microfluidic paper-based analytical devices (mu PADs) is most notably characterized by portable and low-cost analysis; however, struggles to achieve the high sensitivity and low detection limits needs required for many environmental applications hinder widespread adoption of this technology. Loss of analyte to the device material represents an important problem impacting sensitivity. Critically, we found that at least 50% of a Ni(II) sample is lost when being transported down a 30 mm paper channel that is representative of structures commonly found in mu PADs. In this work, we report simple strategies such as adding a waste zone, enlarging the detection zone, and using an elution step to increase device performance. A mu PAD combining the best performing functionalities led to a 78% increase in maximum signal and a 28% increase in sensitivity when transporting Ni(II) samples. Using the optimized mu PAD also led to a 94% increase in maximum signal for Mn(II) samples showing these modifications can be applied more generally. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The development of powerful techniques to detect cancer cells at early stages plays a notable role in diagnosing and prognosing cancer patients and reducing mortality. This paper reports on a novel functional DNA nanoassembly capable of detecting cancer cells based on structural DNA nanotechnology. DNA nanoassemblies were constructed by the self-assembly of a DNA concatemer to a plenty of sticky-ended three-way junctions. While an aptamer moiety guided the nanoassembly to the target cancer cell, the peroxidase-mimicking DNAzymes embedded in the nanoassemblies were used as the sensing element to produce colorimetric signals. As proof-of-concept, as low as 175 cancer cells were detected by the assay, and color change was clearly distinguished by the naked eyes. The proposed system enjoys potential applications for point-of-care cancer diagnosis, with its excellent sensitivity and selectivity. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A capillary electrophoretic (CE) method using a short-sweep approach and laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) detection (ShortSweepCE-LIF) was developed for determination of Zn2+ and Cd2+ as complexes with highly selective and sensitive fluorescent probe FluoZin-3. The ShortSweepCE-LIF method, established in this work, can be used for examining competitive Zn2+ and Cd2+ binding properties of metalloproteins or peptides. The parameters including background electrolyte composition, injection pressure and time as well as separation voltage were investigated. Under the optimized conditions, 80 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, with 1.5 mu M FluoZin-3 was used as an electrolyte, hydrodynamic injection was performed at 50 mbar for 5 s, and separation voltage of 25 kV. Limits of detection for Zn2+ and Cd2+ were 4 and 125 nM, respectively. The developed method was demonstrated in a study of interactions between metalothionein-2a isoform and metal ions Zn2+, Co2+ and Cd2+. It was found that FluoZin-3 was able to extract a single Zn2+ ion, while added Co2+ (in surplus) extracted only 2.4 Zn2+ ions, and Cd2+ extracted all 7 Zn2+ ions present in the metalothionein molecule.

AB Infectious diseases caused by Listeria monocytogenes pose a great threat to public health worldwide. Therefore, a rapid and efficient method for L. monocytogenes detection is needed. In this study, a biotin-exposure-based immunomagnetic separation (IMS) method was developed. That is, biotinylated antibody was first targeted to L. monocytogenes. Then, streptavidin-functionalized magnetic nanoparticles were added and anchored onto L. monocytogenes cells indirectly through the strong noncovalent interaction between streptavidin and biotin. Biotin-exposure-based IMS exhibited an excellent capability to enrich L. monocytogenes. Specifically, more than 90% of L. monocytogenes was captured when the bacterial concentration was lower than 10(4) colony-forming units (CFU)/mL. Importantly, the antibody dosage was reduced by 10 times of that in our previous study, which used antibody direct-conjugated magnetic nanoparticles. Propidium monoazide (PMA) treatment prior to PCR amplification could eliminate the false-positive results from dead bacteria and detected viable L. monocytogenes sensitively and specifically. For viable L. monocytogenes detection, enriched L. monocytogenes was treated with PMA prior to asymmetric PCR amplification. The detection limits of the combined IMS with nucleic acid lateral flow (NALF) biosensor for viable L. monocytogenes detection were 3.5 x 10(3) CFU/mL in phosphate buffer solution and 3.5 x 10(4) CFU/g in lettuce samples. The whole assay process of recognizing viable L. monocytogenes was completed within 6 h. The proposed biotin-exposure-mediated IMS combined with a disposable NALF biosensor platform posed no health risk to the end user, and possessed potential applications in the rapid screening and identification of foodborne pathogens.

AB Reactive pyrolysis is a technique that provides mechanistic information by performing pyrolysis of the substrate in a sealed glass capsule at elevated temperature and pressure for relatively long time. This technique has already shown great potential for the analysis of biomass, favouring the formation of only the most thermostable compounds. In this work, both fast and reactive pyrolysis with on-line gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis (Py-GC/MS) are used to study fructose, inulin and Jerusalem artichoke tubers (Heliantus tuberosus). Interesting differences were found between the two systems, and became even more evident as the reaction time was increased. The most striking result was the formation of di-fructose dianhydrides (DFAs), a class of compounds with interesting biological activities. DFAs were obtained in high yields from reactive pyrolysis, but not from fast pyrolysis. Hypotheses on the pyrolysis mechanisms were made based upon the composition of the pyrolysates. This work describes for the first time the behaviour of fructans under reactive pyrolysis. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Proper management of an HIV infection requires that a patient be at least 80-95% adherent to a prescribed drug regimen to avoid poor health outcomes and the development of drug-resistant HIV strains. Clinicians generally monitor adherence habits indirectly through patient self-reporting, pill counting, and electronic drug monitoring. While direct measurement of patient samples like urine for monitoring drug levels is possible, it requires specialized equipment and training that is not readily available in resource-limited settings where the need is greatest. In this work we report the development of an antibody that binds to tenofovir (TFV), a key small molecule drug for both the treatment and prevention of HIV, and a competitive lateral flow assay that uses that antibody to monitor urine samples for the presence of the drug. TFV was conjugated to an immunogenic protein and injected into rabbits to raise polyclonal antibodies sensitive to the drug. The antibodies were verified for TFV-sensitivity by immunoprecipitation and HPLC. A gold nanoparticle-based competitive assay was developed to detect the presence of TFV in urine samples with a sensitivity of 1 mu g mL(-1). This TFV assay could be deployed as a point-of-care device for adherence monitoring in resource-limited settings as a low-cost, accurate, and speedy alternative to current methods to better inform changes in treatment.

AB The rapid development of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) in therapeutic and diagnostic applications has necessitated the advancement of mAbs purification technologies. In this study, a biomimetic small peptide ligand 3,5-di-tert-butyl-4-hydroxybenzoic acid-Arg-Arg-Gly (DAAG) functionalized monolith was fabricated through a metal ion chelation-based multi-step approach. The resulting monolith showed good chromatographic performance. Compared with the Ni2+ based IMAC monolith, the DAAG functionalized monolith exhibited not only excellent specificity but also higher dynamic binding capacity (DBC). The 10% DBC and 50% DBC for hIgG reached as high values as 26.0 and 34.6 mg/mL, respectively, at a ligand density of 8.8 mmol/mL, due to the high porosity and accessibility of the monolithic matrix. Moreover, the stability of the DAAG functionalized monolith in successive breakthrough experiments indicates that it has a promising potential for long-term use in mAbs purification. Finally, the DAAG functionalized monolith was successfully applied to the purification of trastuzumab or human immunoglobulin G (hIgG) from biological samples. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB Solvent-terminated dispersive liquid-liquid microextraction (ST-DLLME) is a special mode of DLLME in which a demulsifying solvent is injected into the cloudy mixture of sample/extractant to break the emulsion and induce phase separation. The demulsification process starts by flocculation of the dispersed microdroplets by Ostwald ripening or coalescence to form larger droplets. Then, the extractant either floats or sinks depending on its density as compared with that for the aqueous sample. The demulsifier should have high surface activity and low surface tension in order to be capable of inducing phase separation. The extraction efficiency in ST-DLLME is controlled by the same experimental variables of normal DLLME (n-DLLME) such as the type and volume of the extractant as well as the disperser. Other parameters such as pH and the temperature of the sample, the stirring rate, the time of extraction and the addition of salt are also important to consider. Along with these factors, the demulsifier type and volume and the demulsification time have to be optimized. By using solvents to terminate the dispersion step in DLLME, the centrifugation process is not necessary. This in turn improves precision, increases throughput, decreases the risk of contamination through human intervention and minimizes the overall analysis time. ST-DLLME has been successfully applied for determination of both inorganic and organic analytes including pesticides and pharmaceuticals in water and biological fluids. Demulsification via solvent injection rather than centrifugation saves energy and makes ST-DLLME easier to automate. These characteristics in addition to the low solvent consumption, the reduced organic waste and the possibility of using water in demulsification bestow green features on ST-DLLME. This tutorial discusses the principle, the practical aspects and the different applications of ST-DLLME. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Herein we report a propeller-like hexaphenylbenzene-based hydrocarbon material (denoted as BT) as the stationary phase for capillary gas chromatography (GC). The statically-coated BT capillary column showed a high column efficiency of 4340 plates m(-1) and weak polarity. Owing to its unique conformation, p-electron toroidal delocalization and intrinsic microporosity, the BT stationary phase exhibited interesting selectivity for aromatic compounds over alkanes. Compared with the graphene (G) column, the BT column showed much prolonged retention and high selectivity for aromatic isomers, especially methylnaphthalenes, dimethylnaphthalenes and phenanthrene/anthracene, mainly because of its propeller-like conformation with rich intercalation effects. Moreover, it exhibited good column repeatability (intra-day, inter-day) and reproducibility (between-column) with RSD values on the retention times less than 0.08% for intra-day, 0.32% for inter-day and 3.8% for between-column, respectively. Also, it showed good potential for determination of minor isomer impurities in real samples. To the best of our knowledge, this work presents the first example of employing an neat aromatic hydrocarbon material as the GC stationary phase with high selectivity for analytes of a wide ranging polarity.

AB Oxidative stress derived biomarkers have been extensively studied for assessing pathological situations in the neonatal period and their usefulness for an early outcome prediction of oxidative stress related diseases in non-invasive biofluids could be demonstrated. This is the first report on a method for the simultaneous detection of a panel of oxidative stress related biomarkers for quantifying damage to proteins and DNA in human breast milk samples. A straightforward sample clean-up procedure using 1.5mL of milk was developed and extracts were analyzed by ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry. The analytical method was validated and applied to human milk samples from a cohort of mothers of preterm infants, as well as donor human milk samples before and after pasteurization at a human milk bank. The results demonstrate the feasibility of this method for the analysis of a panel of oxidative stress related biomarkers, reporting ranges found in human milk. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB In this work, a newly developed surface plasma resonance (SPR) system for the sensitive detection of M.SssI activity has been designed based on double signal amplification with DNA chain cyclic reactions and AuNPs. In the absence of M.SssI, hairpin DNA 1 (HP1) can be cleaved into s1 fragments catalyzed by HpaII. The s1 fragments can then trigger a recycling process of hairpin DNA 2 (HP2) hybridization and subsequently release massive s2 and s3 in the solution of Nt.AlwI and HPII. AuNPs-DNA can be captured on gold film by the released s2 and s3 to produce a strong SPR signal. Whereas in the presence of M.SssI, methylated HP1 cannot be cleaved by HpaII, thus produce a weak SPR signal. The SPR signals are dependent on the M.SssI concentration in the range from 0.5 to 50 U/mL. The successful detection of M.SssI activity in clinical serum samples and inhibition of M.SssI using 5-Aza and 5-Aza-dC indicate a great potential of this strategy for building new monitoring platform in bioanalysis and clinical biomedicine.

AB A method for simultaneous measure of nine neonicotinoid insecticide residues in soil was developed by using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) coupled with a quick pretreatment procedure. The soil was extracted with a mixture of acetonitrile and dichloromethane (1:2, v:v) and cleaned up with Primary Secondary Amine (PSA). Matrix-matched standards were prepared to eliminate the interference of the matrix. The LCeMS/MS conditions were optimized to separate the nine neonicotinoids within 6.7 min, and the obtained limits of detection (LODs) and limits of quantification (LOQs) ranged from 0.01 to 0.84 ng g(-1) and 0.05-2.79 ng g(-1), respectively. Recoveries of the studied neonicotinoids (except for nitenpyram) ranged from 79.41 to 100.20% with relative standard deviations (RSDs) less than 10% at spiked levels of 5 ng mL(-1), 100 ng mL(-1) and 500 ng mL(-1), and RSDs for the interday and intraday method repeatability were less than 9%. The method was applied to measure neonicotinoid residues in soil samples collected from parks (n = 35) and residential areas (n = 33) in Tianjin, China. Seven neonicotinoids were detected, with imidacloprid being the most frequently detected one, followed by acetamiprid and thiamethoxam. The total concentrations of neonicotinoids in soil ranged from 0.27 to 230.76 ng g(-1) in parks and 0.23-132.66 ng g(-1) in residential areas. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB We have investigated the role of kosmotropic anionic moieties and chaotropic cationic moieties of room temperature hydrophilic ionic liquids in enhancing the biosensing performance of affinity based immunochemical biosensors in human sweat. Two ionic liquids, 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium tetra-fluoroborate (BMIM[BF4]) and choline dihydrogen phosphate (Choline[DHP]) were investigated in this study with Choline[DHP] being more kosmotropic in nature having a more protein stabilizing effect based on the hofmeister series. Non-faradaic interfacial charge transfer has been employed as the mechanism for evaluating the formation and the biosensing of capture probe antibodies in room temperature ionic liquids (RTILs)/aqueous human sweat interface. The charge of the ionic moieties were utilized to form compact electrical double layers around the antibodies for enhancing the stability of the antibody capture probes, which was evaluated through zeta potential measurements. The zeta potential measurements indicated stability of antibodies due to electrostatic repulsion of the RTIL charged moieties encompassing the antibodies, thus preventing any aggregation. Here, we report for the first time of non-faradaic electrochemical impedance spectroscopy equivalent circuit model analysis for analyzing and interpreting affinity based biosensing at hybrid electrode/ionic liquid-aqueous sweat buffer interface guided by the choice of the ionic liquid. Interleukin-6 (IL-6) and cortisol two commonly occurring biomarkers in human sweat were evaluated using this method. The limit of detection (LOD) obtained using both ionic liquids for IL-6 was 0.2 pg mL(-1) with cross-reactivity studies indicating better performance of IL-6 detection using Choline[DHP] and no response to cross-reactive molecule. The LOD of 0.1 ng/mL was achieved for cortisol and the cross-reactivity studies indicated that cortisol antibody in BMIM[BF4] did not show any signal response to cross-reactive molecules. Furthermore, improved sensitivity and LOD was achieved using ionic liquids as compared to capture probes in aqueous buffer. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Silver nanoparticles (Ag NPs) enhanced perylene probe excimer emission is reported for the first time. It was observed that strong interactions between the perylene probe and the Ag NPs induced co-aggregation. As a result, a new in situ generated plasmonic absportion band of the Ag NPs at longer wavelength emerged. The monomer emission of the perylene probe was efficiently quenched, and dramatically enhanced probe excimer emission was observed. A remarkable emission enhancement of over 1000 fold was obtained compared to anionic polymers and other nanoparticles. The excimer emission intensity could be finely modulated by the size of the Ag NPs and the functionalities of the perylene probe. The observed Ag NPs enhanced perylene probe excimer emission shows good potential for the development of novel sensing techniques for various bioanalytical applications. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB Cyclobutane pyrimidine dimmers (CPDs) and 6-4-[pyrimidine-2'-one] pyrimidine (6-4 PP) are major UV induced DNA damage lesions formed from solar radiation and other sources. CPD lesions are presumably mutagenic and carcinogenic that inhibit polymerases and interfere in DNA replication. An easy and cost effective way for visual detection of these lesions by using fluorescence based method is shown here. Artificial UVA and UVB lights were used for the generation of CPD and 6-4 PPs in selected DNA samples. Binding of Hg2+ ions with DNA before and after induction of CPD and 6-4 PP lesions was evaluated in the presence of highly fluorescent blue emitting carbon dots (CDs). Induction of CPD and 6-4 PPs in DNA causes distortion of DNA structure which hinders the binding of Hg2+ ions to DNA nucleobases. Quenching of fluorescence intensity of CDs by unbound Hg2+ ions was found to be proportional to the amount of CPD and 6-4 PP lesions induced by UV irradiation of DNA samples that offer a biosensing platform for the sensitive detection of CPD lesions in DNA. The fluorescent quenching was visually detectable using hand held UV light without the intervention of any equipment. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Countercurrent chromatography (CCC) has gradually become a widely used method for preparative separation of bioactive natural molecules. These molecules generally contain distinct scaffolds and characteristics that cannot be readily isolated from plants. While one-dimensional CCC is typically used for the initial purification with insufficiently resolved peaks after locating bioactive components, two-dimensional (2D) or multi-dimensional CCC strategies are employed to improve the resolution of peaks. However, these methods usually present certain disadvantages, such as complicated procedures and increased time consumption, experimental costs, and equipment requirements. Here, a bioactivity-guided cut CCC strategy was established to isolate lysine-specific demethylase 1 (LSD1) inhibitors from Scutellaria baicalensis Georgi. Gradient-elution CCC coupled with real-time detection of LSD1 inhibition by the collected fractions was developed. Next, an online-storage recycling CCC mode was designed to enable the active fractions to be stored in coils, and these active fractions were further separated to obtain pure compounds by using sequential recycling elution. In this strategy, active fractions are first identified, and then pure LSD1 inhibitors are isolated in the 2D CCC mode through continuous separation on a single instrument. By using our bioactivity-guided cut CCC strategy, we successfully isolated six natural LSD1 inhibitors from S. baicalensis Georgi, five of which were identified for the first time as natural LSD1 inhibitors.

AB Sample preparation is a key issue in the analysis of many real samples using ion chromatography (IC). One of the many means of sample preparation that has received considerable attention in recent years is the stopped-flow in-line dialysis approach hyphenated to IC. Using appropriate dialysis membranes undesirable high-molecular weight compounds, colloids and dispersed particulate matter are retained whereas the analyte ions pass through the membrane and are separated and quantified by IC.
   However, in the many papers about analytical use of in-line dialysis (not only in connection with IC) the retention of undesirable compounds has never been quantified. This study is a first attempt to fil this gap. The breakthrough (BT) of humic acids (HA) and lignin as model compounds often contained in natural water samples was investigated in the stopped-flow dialysis procedure using different dialysis membranes. BT was measured and quantified by UV-absorption in the receiver solution leaving the dialysis cell. The most important factor for retention of undesired compounds is the pore size or the molecular weight cut-off (MWCO) of the dialysis membrane. In addition, the recovery of analytes in acceptable time needs to be considered. The optimized system addresses these two aspects and permits using the proper membrane almost quantitative recovery of several inorganic ions and at the same time almost complete retention of the model interferents. Artificial natural water samples were prepared and analyzed containing a mixture of HA, lignin and a surfactant and a number of anions. In long-term operation no alterations of the dialysis process occurred and no adverse effects in IC separations were observed. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Aiming to overcome the obstacles of power supply requirement and chip usefulness in practice, a low-cost and convenient portable electrochemical sensing device is introduced for the first time, featuring bipolar electrode system, LED read-out, laminated paper-based devices, and low-voltage button cells. The electric circuits of this practical device are constructed on laminating films with copper and conductive carbon tapes, and the reservoirs facilitating chemical reactions are made with chromatography paper. The device is sensitive to electrochemical responses, validated by the demonstrative hydrogen peroxide and enzyme-assisted glucose detection. The business-card-size chip achieves sensitive analyte detection by naked eyes as well as further image processing in both laboratory samples and human serum samples testing, featuring detection limit as low as 1.79 mu M and a dynamic range from 10 mu M to 10 mM. This new practical design of point-of-care sensing chip entails the properties of facile fabrication, simple usage, high robustness, low power consumption, and accurate sensing showing the attainability of fabricating a useful and portable analytical device.

AB In the present work, two approaches for the voltammetric fingerprinting of oils and their combination with chemometrics were investigated in order to detect the adulteration of extra virgin olive oil with olive pomace oil as well as the most common seed oils, namely sunflower, soybean and corn oil. In particular, cyclic voltammograms of diluted extra virgin olive oils, regular (pure) olive oils (blends of refined olive oils with virgin olive oils), olive pomace oils and seed oils in presence of dichloromethane and 0.1 M of LiClO4 in EtOH as electrolyte were recorded at a glassy carbon working electrode. Cyclic voltammetry was also employed in methanolic extracts of olive and seed oils. Datapoints of cyclic voltammograms were exported and submitted to Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Partial Least Square-Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA) and soft independent modeling of class analogy (SIMCA). In diluted oils, PLS-DA provided a clear discrimination between olive oils (extra virgin and regular) and olive pomace/seed oils, while SIMCA showed a clear discrimination of extra virgin olive oil in regard to all other samples. Using methanolic extracts and considering datapoints recorded between 0.6 and 1.3 V, PLS-DA provided more information, resulting in three clusters-extra virgin olive oils, regular olive oils and seed/olive pomace oils-while SIMCA showed inferior performance. For the quantification of extra virgin olive oil adulteration with olive pomace oil or seed oils, a model based on Partial Least Square (PLS) analysis was developed. Detection limit of adulteration in olive oil was found to be 2% (v/v) and the linearity range up to 33% (v/v). Validation and applicability of all models was proved using a suitable test set. In the case of PLS, synthetic oil mixtures with 4 known adulteration levels in the range of 4-26% were also employed as a blind test set. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Sensitivity and selectivity of the solid phase microextraction (SPME) in analysis are mostly determined by the coating material of the fiber used. Graphene oxide (GO) has attracted great attention because of its large specific surface area, rich oxygen functional groups, good dispersibility in aqueous solution and high reactivity. However, the low thermal stability of the functional groups limits the wide application of GO in SPME coating design. Highly cross-linked polyoxyethylene (POE) is a substrate widely used for composite material construction, which could significantly improve the thermal stability, water resistance as well as biocompatibility of the functional materials. In this study, we incorporated GO with highly crosslinked POE as a novel fiber coating material for SPME through the gluing approach. The obtained fiber possessed a wrinkled shape surface, which could increase the accessible surface area. In addition, the thermal and chemical stability of the fiber coating were also improved, rendering the fiber rigid enough for more than 100 repetitive extraction cycles. The performance of this developed SPME method for phenols was evaluated by headspace extraction of phenols in aqueous samples. Compared with three commercial fibers, the home-made fiber showed excellent extraction efficiencies towards phenols. Under the optimized conditions, it showed low detection limits (0.12-1.36 ng.L-1), good precision (<8.4%), good fiber-to-fiber repeatability (3.1%-8.1%), wide linear range (almost 5-1000 ng.L-1 and correlation coefficients (R-2) >99%), as well as good enrichment efficiencies (enrichment factors (EFs), 172-1752). Furthermore, the method was successfully applied in simultaneous analyses of five phenols for real water samples with satisfactory recoveries (81-113% for the Pearl River samples).

AB The high performance separation and pre-concentration of polar phenols from aqueous matrices is difficult because of the strong interactions between phenols and water molecules. Conjugated micro-porous polymers (CMPs) are a kind of novel porous organic materials. Polyphenylene core-conjugated microporous polymers (PPc-CMPs) were used as a novel coating material in the solid-phase micro-extraction of polar phenols in water samples for the first time. The novel PPc-CMPs fibers exhibited good thermal stability (>450 degrees C), high enrichment factors (519-2372), low limits of detection (0.02-0.05 ng L-1), wide linearity (0.1-1000 ng L-1), and good repeatability (2.5%-8.1%) for polar phenols. The new coating was successfully used in the analysis of phenols in real environmental water samples. PPc-CMPs as a polar solid-phase microextraction coating material was excellent for the rapid and sensitive analysis of phenols at trace levels in the environment. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB We report a rapid and facile method for detection of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) in biological fluids using sub-stoichiometric two-dimensional (2D) molybdenum trioxide (alpha-MoO3-x) nanoflakes. The two-dimensional nanoflakes, initially blue in color, is oxidized after interaction with hydrogen peroxide thereby changing its oxidation state to form alpha-MoO3. The change in oxidation state of nanoflakes transforms from blue to a visually distinct hazy blue color with change in absorption spectrum. The phenomenal property is explored here in sensing up to 34 nM as limit of detection. The efficacy of the detection system was analyzed by "zone of inhibition" based agar diffusion assay with different concentrations of H2O2. The current approach is highly accurate, effective and reproducible for quantification of physiological concentration of H2O2 in biological fluid such as human urine. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB A multifunctional material based on co-electrospinning has been developed as a basic material for the development of biosensors with optical oxygen transduction. It is based on coaxial nanofibres: inner fibres containing an oxygen sensitive dye and outer fibres containing aldehyde groups to allow the formation of Schiff bases with the amino groups of the enzyme. The resulting material preserves the oxygen sensing properties of the inner optical transducer as well as exhibits a high capacity for immobilizing molecules on its surface.
   Uricase has been selected as model enzyme and several parameters (temperature, pH, reaction time, buffer, and enzyme concentration) have been optimised to demonstrate the versatility of this novel multifunctional material in the development of biosensors with optical oxygen transduction for determining uric acid in serum samples. It suggests that the proposed multifunctional material can provide a promising multifunctional platform for biosensing applications. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Digital ELISA for the quantification of attomolar concentrations of
   Alzheimer's disease biomarker protein Tau in biological samples
SO ANALYTICA CHIMICA ACTA

AB The close correlation between Tau pathology and Alzheimer's disease (AD) progression makes this protein a suitable biomarker for diagnosis and monitoring of the disorder evolution. However, the use of Tau in diagnostics has been hampered, as it currently requires collection of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), which is an invasive clinical procedure. Although measuring Tau-levels in blood plasma would be favorable, the concentrations are below the detection limit of a conventional ELISA. In this work, we developed a digital ELISA for the quantification of attomolar protein Tau concentrations in both buffer and biological samples. Individual Tau molecules were first captured on the surface of magnetic particles using in-house developed antibodies and subsequently isolated into the femtoliter-sized wells of a 2 x 2 mm(2) microwell array. Combination of high-affinity antibodies, optimal assay conditions and a digital quantification approach resulted in a 24 +/- 7 aM limit of detection (LOD) in buffer samples. Additionally, a dynamic range of 6 orders of magnitude was achieved by combining the digital readout with an analogue approach, allowing quantification from attomolar to picomolar levels of Tau using the same platform. This proves the compatibility of the presented assay with the wide range of Tau concentrations encountered in different biological samples. Next, the developed digital assay was applied to detect total Tau levels in spiked blood plasma. A similar LOD (55 +/- 29 aM) was obtained compared to the buffer samples, which was 5000-fold more sensitive than commercially available ELISAs and even outperformed previously reported digital assays with 10-fold increase in sensitivity. Finally, the performance of the developed digital ELISA was assessed by quantifying protein Tau in three clinical CSF samples. Here, a high correlation (i.e. Pearson coefficient of 0.99) was found between the measured percentage of active particles and the reference protein Tau values. The presented digital ELISA technology has great capacity in unlocking the potential of Tau as biomarker for early AD diagnosis. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Fabry disease is an X-linked lysosomal storage disorder with marked variability in the phenotype and genotype. Glycosphingolipids such as globotriaosylceramide (Gb(3)) isoforms/analogs, globotriaosyl-sphingosine (lyso-Gb(3)) and analogs, and galabiosylceramide (Ga-2) isoforms/analogs may accumulate in biological fluids and different organs. The aims of this study were to: 1) develop/validate a novel UHPLC-MS/MS method for relative quantitation of Gb(3) in leukocytes (unfractionated white blood cells), B lymphocytes and monocytes; 2) evaluate these biomarkers in a cohort of Fabry patients and healthy controls; and 3) assess correlations between these biomarkers, treatment and genotype. Whole blood, plasma and urine samples from 21 Fabry patients and 20 healthy controls were analyzed. Samples were purified by liquid-liquid extraction and analyzed by UHPLC-MS/MS in positive electrospray ionization. Methylated Gb(3) isoforms were detected, showing that a methylation process occurs at the cellular level. Our results show that there were no significant differences in the distribution of the different Gb(3) isoforms/analogs in blood cells between Fabry patients and healthy controls. In leukocyte, Gb(3)[(d18:1)(C14:0)], Gb(3)[(d18:1)(C16:0)], Gb(3) [(d18:1)(C16:0)] Me, Gb(3) [(d18:1)(C16:1)], Gb(3) [(d18:1)(C18:0)], Gb(3) [(d18:1)(C18:1)], Gb(3) [(d18:1)(C20:1)], Gb(3) [(d18:1)(C24:2)], Gb(3) [(d18:1)(C26:1)] and total Gb(3) allowed good discrimination between male Fabry patients and male controls, patients having higher biomarker levels than controls. Regarding B lymphocytes and monocytes, the same tendency was observed without reaching statistical significance. A positive concordance between mutation types and biomarker levels in white blood cells was established. Our results might provide a deeper mechanistic comprehension of the underlying biochemical processes of Gb(3) biomarkers in white blood cells of Fabry patients. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB Mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) has become a powerful tool to probe molecule events in biological tissue. However, it is a widely held viewpoint that one of the biggest challenges is an easy-to-use data processing software for discovering the underlying biological information from complicated and huge MSI dataset. Here, a user-friendly and full-featured MSI software including three subsystems, Solution, Visualization and Intelligence, named MassImager, is developed focusing on interactive visualization, in-situ biomarker discovery and artificial intelligent pathological diagnosis. Simplified data preprocessing and high-throughput MSI data exchange, serialization jointly guarantee the quick reconstruction of ion image and rapid analysis of dozens of gigabytes datasets. It also offers diverse self-defined operations for visual processing, including multiple ion visualization, multiple channel superposition, image normalization, visual resolution enhancement and image filter. Regions-of-interest analysis can be performed precisely through the interactive visualization between the ion images and mass spectra, also the overlaid optical image guide, to directly find out the region-specific biomarkers. Moreover, automatic pattern recognition can be achieved immediately upon the supervised or unsupervised multivariate statistical modeling. Clear discrimination between cancer tissue and adjacent tissue within a MSI dataset can be seen in the generated pattern image, which shows great potential in visually in-situ biomarker discovery and artificial intelligent pathological diagnosis of cancer. All the features are integrated together in MassImager to provide a deep MSI processing solution at the in-situ metabolomics level for biomarker discovery and future clinical pathological diagnosis.

AB Parabens are used as antimicrobial preservatives in food, cosmetic products and pharmaceuticals regardless of their endocrine disrupting effect. In this study, highly selective molecular imprinted polymers (MIPs) were synthesized in submicron-sizes and converted to an SPME fiber coating through electrospinning process in order to determine parabens in water samples. Conversion of MIP to a fiber is achieved via creation of spacial knitting around MIP by polystyrene. The selectivity and extraction ability of the fibers were compared with the commercial fibers and the corresponding non-imprinted polymer (NIP) coated fiber. The coated fiber showed better extraction ability among them. Also, the results revealed that the fiber has better selectivity for benzyl paraben and the other structurally-related compounds, such as methyl and propyl paraben. Extraction efficiency of prepared fibers for three parabens has been tested by spiking bottled, tap and sea water samples. The recoveries changed between 92.2 +/- 0.8 and 99.8 +/- 0.1 for three different water types. This method could be used for selective and sensitive determination of parabens in aqueous samples.

AB This paper described a novel, facile and nonenzymatic electrochemical biosensor to detect hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). The sensor was fabricated based on Pd-Pt nanocages and SnO2/graphene nanosheets modified electrode (PdPt NCs@SGN/GCE). The electrochemical behavior of PdPt NCs@SGN/GCE exhibited excellent catalytic activity toward H2O2 with fast response, high selectivity, superior sensitivity, low detection limit of 0.3 mu M and large linear range from 1 mM to 300 mu M. Under these obvious advantages, the constructed biosensor provided to be reliable for determination of H2O2 secreted from human cervical cancer cells (Hela cells). Hence, the proposed biosensor is a promising candidate for detection of H2O2 in situ released from living cells in clinical diagnostics. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A novel and general strategy of split-type immunoassay is developed based on redox chemical reaction modulated photoelectrochemistry of carbon dots (CDs). Specifically, the photocurrent of the CDs sensitized titanium dioxide nanoparticles (TiO2 NPs) modified fluorine doped indium tin oxide (FTO) (that is the FTO/TiO2/CDs) electrode was inhibited obviously by KMnO4 due to the oxidation of surface hydroxyl groups of CDs to electron accepting carbonyls. While the inhibited photocurrent of the KMnO4 treated FTO/TiO2/CDs electrode can be restored by ascorbic acid (AA) because of the regeneration of electron donating hydroxyls to promote electron-hole separation. Take carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) as a model analyte and alkaline phosphate (ALP) as a catalytic label tracer to hydrolyze ascorbic acid 2-phosphate (AAP) for producing AA, which greatly stimulated the photocurrent of the transducer of KMnO4 treated FTO/TiO2/CDs photoelectrode for signal output. This redox chemical reaction modulated PEC strategy enabled the separation of the immunoreaction from the photoelectrode (that is, a split-type PEC detection), eliminating potential damage of biomolecules during the PEC detection processes and leading to enhanced throughput detection as compared to conventional PEC configurations. A low detection limit of 7.0 fg/mL was achieved for CEA. This convenient, split-type PEC immunoassay with high throughput may be easily extended to other bioaffinity assays for versatile targets.

AB Covalent organic framework (COF) was explored as a novel matrix with a high desorption/ionization efficiency for direct detection of small molecules by laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (LDI-TOF MS). By using COF as an LDI MS matrix, we could detect not only biological micro molecules such as amino acids and fatty acids, but also emerging environmental pollutants like bisphenol S (BPS) and pyrene. With COF as the matrix, higher desorption/ionization efficiency, and less background interference were achieved than the conventional organic matrices. Good salt tolerance (as high as 500mM NaCl) and repeatability allowed the detection limit of amino acids was 90 fmol. In addition, COF matrix performed well for amino acids analysis in the honey sample. The ionization mechanism was also discussed. These results demonstrate that COF is a powerful matrix for small molecules analysis in real samples by MS. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A simple structured reaction-based probe for peroxynitrite (ONOO-) was developed by using benzothiazole hydrazone base of the excited-state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT) dye. It was constructed from 2-hydrazinylpyridine and 3-(benzo[d] thiazol-2-yl)-2-hydroxy-5-methylbenzaldehyde which possesses itself weak fluorescence and displayed prominent fluorescence response towards ONOO- by oxidizes the C=N bond to an aldehyde in aqueous solution. The probe exhibited excellent selectivity and high sensivity towards ONOO- with a low dectection limit of 5.8 x 10(-8)M in physiological condition. Moreover, the probe could realize fast recognition to ONOO- in as short as 60 s. In addition, the probe was also successfully used for living cell imaging. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Hybrid nanomaterials with synergistic effect are highly potential for developing advanced nanozymes. Herein, we designed a nanozyme assembled by polyethylenimine (PEI)-protected reduced graphene oxide anchoring iron oxide (PRGI) and Pt nanoparticle using electrostatic interaction, PRGI/Pt nanohybrid. The different ratio of PRGI nanocomposite and Pt nanoparticle could control PRGI/Pt nanohybrid's surface charge and stability, which determined PRGI/Pt nanohybrid's catalytic activity. At the mass ratio of 0.8, the as-obtained PRGI/Pt nanohybrid showed the highest catalytic ability, and was better than Pt nanoparticle at different pH and temperature, although the PRGI/Pt nanohybrid showed lower affinity for TMB than Pt nanoparticle, which maybe attributed to the fact that PRGI/Pt nanohybrid possessed better product desorption ability or larger contact area. Furthermore, PRGI/Pt nanohybrid showed much higher catalytic activity than the sum of PRGI nanocomposite and Pt nanoparticle, indicating the strong cooperation between PRGI nanocomposite and Pt nanoparticle. Our study also provided a new way to conveniently construct nanozyme based on hybrid nanomaterials. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A novel phenyl modified PDMS (PhPDMS) sol-gel adsorption phase was developed for use with the capillary microextraction of volatiles (CMV) device, and determined to provide significant enhancement in BTEX recoveries when sampling trace (ng) amounts of these volatiles at ambient conditions.
   The previously reported reusable PDMS-CMV device has been demonstrated to rapidly and efficiently extract target compound's vapors in forensic and environmental applications. An improved recovery for VOCs was achieved with a cryofocusing system while extracting at -10 degrees C, but it was found to be impractical for field sampling. This report details a modification to the CMV's chemistry, by the successful introduction of phenyl groups to the PDMS sol-gel adsorption phase, allowing enhanced performance at ambient extraction conditions. Higher average recoveries, determined through a broad concentration range, were demonstrated for PhPDMS-CMV over its original PDMS-CMV, from cans simulating a closed space set-up. Within 7.8 (+/- 10%) and 3.5 (+/- 6%) folds higher for benzene and toluene, respectively and 2 (+/- 2%) folds for ethylbenzene and xylenes. Significant higher retaining capabilities were demonstrated also at the more challenging set-up, simulating an open space environment. Whereas, benzene had completely breakthrough the PDMS-CMV, its reliable detection was still confirmed with PhPDMS-CMV pumping at 2 L or 6 L air, concentration dependent. At least 50 folds (+/- 26%) more toluene was retained with PhPDMS-CMV at 6 L air than with PDMS-CMV. The enhanced overall performance lead to determination of trace LODs with the new CMV of 0.002, 0.00035 and 0.00015 ppm for benzene, toluene, ethyl benzene and xylenes, respectively. As proof of concept, for the first time solvent extraction is presented for the new CMV as an alternative to thermal desorption extraction. Extraction efficiencies of 60% for TEX, and lower concentration dependent for benzene, were demonstrated with the ease and rapid application of 100 mL acetone through the device.
   The improvements described in this study continues to build on the potential for the use of the reusable new CMV device by expanding its possible potential applications for fast and sensitive air sampling of VOCs. The solvent extraction step may offer compatibility with LC-based systems. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The influence of six common substrates on the Raman imaging of micron-sized inorganic aerosol particles was examined. Laboratory-generated single-component particles of calcite (CaCO3) and mixed particles of calcite (CaCO3), nitratine (NaNO3), hematite (Fe2O3) and anglesite (PbSO4) were deposited by cascade impaction on Ag, In, Si, SiO2, microscope slide and TEM-grid substrates. The spectral contribution of substrates to Raman images of the deposited particles was evaluated by Multivariate Curve Resolution. The shape and intensity of the substrate spectra affect the effectiveness capability of the spectral deconvolution. The substrates were characterized and compared with respect to their effect on the reconstruction of Raman images of aerosol particles. The TEM-grid substrate yielded spatially stable sample measurements with a homogeneous spectral contribution, satisfactory Raman map reconstruction and the potential for application in other techniques (e.g., SEM-EDX).

AB The recent hyphenation of ion mobility spectrometry (IMS) with high resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) has risen as a powerful technique for both targeted and non-targeted screening, reducing background noise and allowing separation of isomeric and isobaric compounds. Nevertheless, such an approach remains largely unexplored in food safety applications, such as mycotoxin analysis. To implement ion mobility in routinely MS-based mycotoxin workflows, searchable databases with collusion cross section (CCS) values and accurate mass-values are required. This paper provides for the first time a traveling-wave IMS (TWIMS)-derived CCS database for mycotoxins, including more than 100 CCS values. The measurements showed high reproducibility (RSD < 2%) across different instrumental conditions as well as several complex cereal matrices, showing a mean inter- matrix precision of RSD < 0.9%. As a proof of concept, the database was applied to the analysis of several spiked as well as naturally incurred cereal-based samples. In addition, the effect of adducts on the drift time was studied in a series of mycotoxins in order to understand potential deviations from expected drift time behaviors.
   Overall, our study confirmed that CCS values represent a physicochemical property that can be used alongside the traditional molecular identifiers of precursor ion accurate mass, fragment ions, isotopic pattern, and retention time. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Antipsychotics are the drugs most often involved in drug poisoning cases, and therefore, therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) is necessary for safe and effective medication administration of these drugs. In this study, a coffee ring effect-based surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (CRE-SERS) method was developed and successfully used to monitor antipsychotic poisoning by using urine samples for the first time. The established method exhibited excellent SERS performance since more hot spots were obtained in the "coffee ring". Using the optimized CRE-SERS method, the sensitivity was improved one order more than that of the conventional method with reasonable reproducibility. The antipsychotic drug clozapine (CLO) spiked into urine samples at 0.5-50 mu g mL(-1) was quantitatively detected, at concentrations above the thresholds for toxicity. The CRE-SERS method allowed CLO and its metabolites to be ultimately distinguished from real poisoning urine samples. The coffee-ring effect would provide more opportunities for practical applications of the SERS-based method. The frequent occurrence of drug poisoning may have created a new area for the application of the CRE-SERS method. It is anticipated that the developed method will also have great potential for other drug poisoning monitoring. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This work focused on the development of a novel ratiometric fluorescence sensor for detection of Hg2+ by using dye-doped lanthanide infinite coordination polymer (Ln-ICP) particles. The dye-doped Ln-ICP used herein was prepared by self-assemble of adenosine monophosphate (AMP) with Ce3+ and Tb3+ (Ce/Tb-AMP) through self-adaptive chemistry, in which the fluorescent dye coumarin was encapsulated during the assembly process as a guest molecule. Under 310 nm irradiation, the obtained coumarin@Ce/Tb-AMP itself emitted characteristic green luminescence of Tb3+, accompanied with a weak fluorescence at 445 nm originated from coumarin encapsulated in the Ce/Tb-AMP networks. The fluorescence emission of coumarin became strong when it was released to the solution. In the presence of Hg2+, the coumarin@Ce/Tb-AMP was destroyed due to the specific coordination interaction between AMP and Hg2+, which leaded to the release of coumarin to the solution meanwhile. Consequently, the fluorescence of Ce/Tb-AMP was quenched, while that of coumarin enhanced. On the basis of this strategy, we developed a novel ratiometric fluorescent sensor for the detection of Hg2+ by measuring the ratio of fluorescent intensity of the coumarin@Ce/Tb-AMP suspension, which showed a wide linear range from 0.08 to 1000 nM and detection limit of 0.03 nM with high selectivity and sensitivity. Furthermore, the constructed ratiometric fluorescent sensor was successfully applied in detecting Hg2+ in drinking water and human blood serum (HBS) with satisfactory results. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB A two-photon fluorescent probe for Cu-2- and S2- has been strategically prepared with naphthalimide derivative platform (NPE) covalently grafted onto the surface of magnetic core-shell Fe3O4@SiO2 nanoparticles. The probe (NPE-Fe3O4@SiO2) exhibits selective response to Cu2+ with enhanced fluorescence and efficient separation of Cu2+ with external magnetic field. The consequent product NPE-Fe3O4@SiO2-Cu of NPE-Fe3O4@SiO2 and Cu2+ can work as an excellent sensor for S2- by removing Cu2+ from the complex with fluorescence decreased, recovering the fluorescence of the probe. Therefore, the constituted Off-On-Off type fluorescence monitoring system means the probe is resumable. Moreover, the probe has been used to quantitatively detect Cu2+ and S2- with low detection limits, which are 0.28 mu M and 0.12 mu M, respectively. Furthermore, the probe shows low cytotoxicity and excellent membrane permeability, which has been successfully applied for monitoring Cu2+ and S2- in living cells and imaging Cu2+ in deep-tissue with two-photon excited fluorescence.

AB Poly(5-hydroxytryptamine) (poly(5-HT)) is exploited as a new and efficient enzyme-immobilization matrix for amperometric and biofuel cell (BFC)-based biosensing. A GOx-poly(5-HT)-Pd nanoparticles (PdNPs) bionanocomposite is prepared by Na2PdCl4-initiated oxidized polymerization of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) in a neutral aqueous solution containing glucose oxidase (GOx), and this bionanocomposite and then chitosan (CS) are cast-coated on a Pd-plated Au electrode to yield a CS/GOx-poly(5-HT)-PdNPs/Pd-plate/Au enzyme electrode. Scanning/transmission electron microscopy, UV-vis spectrophotometry and electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance are employed for material characterization and/or process monitoring. Under optimized conditions, the amperometric response of the enzyme electrode is linear with glucose concentration from 2.0 mu M to 6.66 mM with a sensitivity of 110 mu A mM(-1) cm(-2), a limit of detection of 0.2 mM, and excellent operation/storage stability in the first-generation biosensing mode. The sensitivity is larger than those of some conventional electrodes under identical conditions. The enzyme electrode also works well in the second-generation biosensing mode. By using the enzyme electrode as the anode for glucose oxidation and a Pd-plate/Au electrode as the cathode for KMnO4 reduction, a monopolar BFC is constructed as a self-powered biosensor, the current response of which is linear with glucose concentration from 50 mu M to 34.5 mM. Experiments also show that poly(5-HT) is a physical and chemical dual-immobilization matrix of enzyme, since the abundant amino groups in poly(5-HT) can be used for chemical bonding of GOx.

AB A simple method by coupling a spray capillary with pressurized photoreactor for on-line monitoring of photolysis reactions was reported. In this method, only an inert gas is used to transfer the reaction solution, which avoids potential sample loss and contamination. The photolysis reaction is online quenched, and therefore, it has advantages of on-line detection and characterization of photolysis reaction intermediates. The assembly is easy to achieve, low-cost, and robust. Different from off-line methods, the photolysis reaction solution is directly transferred to a capillary tip for ionization, avoiding the delay in the detection of reactive intermediates. With this setup, this technique has been applied for on-line monitoring of degradation of cyclophosphamide (CP) in H2O2/UV for which two new intermediates were intercepted and structurally characterized for the first time by tandem mass spectrometry. In H2O2/UV, the degradation of CP occurred via hydroxylation, dehydrogenation, chlorine substitution reaction, and cleavage of the chloroethyl group. These results indicate that the coupling of electrospray ionization mass spectrometry with pressurized photoreactor can detect and characterize the key photolysis reaction intermediates, which render it a potential tool for elucidating the mechanism of water remediation.

AB UltraViolet (UV) spectroscopy was evaluated as an innovative Process Analytical Technology (PAT) - tool for the in-line and real-time quantitative determination of low-dosed active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) in a semi-solid (gel) and a liquid (suspension) pharmaceutical formulation during their batch production process. The performance of this new PAT-tool (i.e., UV spectroscopy) was compared with an already more established PAT-method based on Raman spectroscopy. In-line UV measurements were carried out with an immersion probe while for the Raman measurements a non-contact PhAT probe was used. For both studied formulations, an in-line API quantification model was developed and validated per spectroscopic technique. The known API concentrations (Y) were correlated with the corresponding in-line collected preprocessed spectra (X) through a Partial Least Squares (PLS) regression. Each developed quantification method was validated by calculating the accuracy profile on the basis of the validation experiments. Furthermore, the measurement uncertainty was determined based on the data generated for the determination of the accuracy profiles. From the accuracy profile of the UV- and Raman-based quantification method for the gel, it was concluded that at the target API concentration of 2% (w/w), 95 out of 100 future routine measurements given by the Raman method will not deviate more than 10% (relative error) from the true API concentration, whereas for the UV method the acceptance limits of 10% were exceeded. For the liquid formulation, the Raman method was not able to quantify the API in the low-dosed suspension (0.09% (w/w) API). In contrast, the in-line UV method was able to adequately quantify the API in the suspension. This study demonstrated that UV spectroscopy can be adopted as a novel in-line PAT-technique for low-dose quantification purposes in pharmaceutical processes. Important is that none of the two spectroscopic techniques was superior to the other for both formulations: the Raman method was more accurate in quantifying the API in the gel (2% (w/w) API), while the UV method performed better for API quantification in the suspension (0.09% (w/w) API).

AB Protein kinase (PKA) can regulate many cellular biological processes by phosphorylation substrate peptide or protein. A new fluorescent biosensing method for the detection of PKA activity was developed by using 11-mercaptoundecanoic acid-capped gold nanoclusters (MUA-Au NCs) and graphene oxide (GO) with low background noise. In this strategy, the special designed peptide could be anchored on the surface of MUA-Au NCs by the Au-S bond and also adsorbed on the surface of GO owing to the electrostatic interaction. As a result, the fluorescence of MUA-Au NCs was quenched leading to low background fluorescence due to the forster resonance energy transfer (FRET) between MUA-Au NCs and GO via peptide as a bridge. However, when the substrate peptide was phosphorylated by PKA, the FRET between GO and MUA-Au NCs was disrupted because of the weakened interaction between the phosphorylated peptide and the GO, resulting in recovery of the fluorescence intensity. The developed label-free fluorescence "turn-off-on" method can detect protein kinase activity in the range of 0.6-2.0 U mL(-1) with a detection limit of 0.17 U mL(-1) (3 sigma). The feasibility of this present method for kinase inhibitor screening was also studied by assessment of H-89 kinase inhibition with an IC50 value of 0.049 mu mol L-1.

AB A novel dual-sensing fluorescence probe L was designed and synthesized for highly selective and sensitive detection of Zn2+ and DNA. The probe L achieved a detection limit of 3.8 nM for Zn2+, which is lower than the acceptable level of Zn2+ in living cells. The probe L displayed high selectivity toward Zn2+ over other interference metal ions and amino acids. Moreover, the probe L displayed low cytotoxicity and good cell permeability, indicating its potential for detecting and bio-imaging of Zn2+. In addition, the probe L-Zn2+ exhibited enhanced fluorescence signal for DNA detection through the metal-coordination interaction between Zn2+ and DNA. The enhanced signal is higher than that of the classical ethidium bromide probe. The experiments in aqueous media verified the feasibility of applying probe L in real samples. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB We propose a new analytical method using reverse phase High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) coupled through an electrospray source with a tandem quadrupole-time-of-flight (ESI-Q-ToF) mass spectrometric detector for the full characterization and quantitation of the different classes of fatty acids and acylglycerols in lipid samples in a single chromatographic run. In this work, we optimized the derivatization reaction for free fatty acids with 2-hydrazinoquinoline, which is a low-cost approach, using a full factorial design. This reaction does not involve transesterification, thus enabling the free fatty acids to be separated and successfully quantified in the presence of mono-, di- and triacylglycerols without altering the whole glyceride profile. This new analytical method provides a full profile of fatty acids, mono-, di-and triglycerides within a relatively short chromatographic run (less than 40 min), with low operating back-pressure (less than 110 bar). The derivatization of the free fatty acids allows their detection in positive mode, with limits of detection in the range of 0.2-1.9 ng/g, and a dynamic range of two orders of magnitude. The figures of merit of the procedure are competitive with respect to the literature.
   The method was validated by characterizing two different types of olive oils. Free fatty acid content was quantified, and the results are consistent with literature data. The method was applied to the characterization of cow milk and an infant formula, after the precipitation of proteins and phospholipids, and proved suitable for the detection of short chain fatty acids, free fatty acids and glycerides highlighting differences in the composition of the two milks.
   The proposed procedure improves the current methods for the analysis of acylglyceride based materials, such as olive oil, and proved promising for the characterization of lipids in complex matrices, such as milk. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The physico-chemical properties of Melamine Formaldehyde (MF) based thermosets are largely influenced by the degree of polymerization (DP) in the underlying resin. On-line supervision of the turbidity point by means of vibrational spectroscopy has recently emerged as a promising technique to monitor the DP of MF resins. However, spectroscopic determination of the DP relies on chemometric models, which are usually sensitive to drifts caused by instrumental and/or sample-associated changes occurring over time. In order to detect the time point when drifts start causing prediction bias, we here explore a universal drift detector based on a faded version of the Page-Hinkley (PH) statistic, which we test in three data streams from an industrial MF resin production process. We employ committee disagreement (CD), computed as the variance of model predictions from an ensemble of partial least squares (PLS) models, as a measure for sample-wise prediction uncertainty and use the PH statistic to detect changes in this quantity. We further explore supervised and unsupervised strategies for (semi-) automatic model adaptation upon detection of a drift. For the former, manual reference measurements are requested whenever statistical thresholds on Hotelling's T-2 and/or Q-Residuals are violated. Models are subsequently re-calibrated using weighted partial least squares in order to increase the influence of newer samples, which increases the flexibility when adapting to new (drifted) states. Unsupervised model adaptation is carried out exploiting the dual antecedent-consequent structure of a recently developed fuzzy systems variant of PLS termed FLEXFIS-PLS. In particular, antecedent parts are updated while maintaining the internal structure of the local linear predictors (i.e. the consequents). We found improved drift detection capability of the CD compared to Hotelling's T-2 and Q-Residuals when used in combination with the proposed PH test. Furthermore, we found that active selection of samples by active learning (AL) used for subsequent model adaptation is advantageous compared to passive (random) selection in case that a drift leads to persistent prediction bias allowing more rapid adaptation at lower reference measurement rates. Fully unsupervised adaptation using FLEXFIS-PLS could improve predictive accuracy significantly for light drifts but was not able to fully compensate for prediction bias in case of significant lack of fit w.r.t. the latent variable space.

ID QUANTIFICATION; QUALITY
AB The limit of detection (LOD) is a key figure of merit in chemical sensing. However, the estimation of this figure of merit is hindered by the non-linear calibration curve characteristic of semiconductor gas sensor technologies such as, metal oxide (MOX), gasFETs or thermoelectric sensors. Additionally, chemical sensors suffer from cross-sensitivities and temporal stability problems. The application of the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) recommendations for univariate LOD estimation in non-linear semiconductor gas sensors is not straightforward due to the strong statistical requirements of the IUPAC methodology (linearity, homoscedasticity, normality). Here, we propose a methodological approach to LOD estimation through linearized calibration models. As an example, the methodology is applied to the detection of low concentrations of carbon monoxide using MOX gas sensors in a scenario where the main source of error is the presence of uncontrolled levels of humidity.

AB New liquid atmospheric pressure (AP) matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) matrices that produce predominantly multiply charged ions have been developed and evaluated with respect to their performance for peptide and protein analysis by mass spectrometry (MS). Both the chromophore and the viscous support liquid in these matrices were optimized for highest MS signal intensity, S/N values and maximum charge state. The best performance in both protein and peptide analysis was achieved employing light diols as matrix support liquids (e.g. ethylene glycol and propylene glycol). Investigating the influence of the chromophore, it was found that 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid resulted in a higher analyte ion signal intensity for the analysis of small peptides; however, larger molecules (>17 kDa) were undetectable. For larger molecules, a sample preparation based on alpha-cyano-4-hydroxycinnammic acid as the chromophore was developed and multiply protonated analytes with charge states of more than 50 were detected. Thus, for the first time it was possible to detect with MALDI MS proteins as large as similar to 80 kDa with a high number of charge states, i.e. m/z values below 2000. Systematic investigations of various matrix support liquids have revealed a linear dependency between laser threshold energy and surface tension of the liquid MALDI sample. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB The various synthetic routes of carbon dots (C-dots) feature a considerable step toward their potential use in chemical sensors and biotechnology. Herein, by coupling phosphorus and nitrogen element introduction, the adenosine-derived N/P co-doped C-dots with fluorescence enhancement were achieved. By separately employing adenosine, adenosine monophosphate, adenosine diphosphate, and adenosine-5'-triphosphate as precursors, the effect of N/P co-doping on the fluorescence emission is discussed in detail. The formed C-dots with adenosine monophosphate exhibited strong blue fluorescence with a high quantum yield of 33.81%. Then the C-dots were employed as a fluorescent probe and utilized to develop a fast, sensitive, and selective picric acid sensor. The fluorescence of C-dots can be quenched by picric acid immediately, giving rise to a picric acid determination down to 30 nM. The possible mechanism of fluorescence quenching was discussed, which was proved to be inner filter effect and static quenching. Moreover, this method has the potential to detect picric acid in environmental water samples. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this study we describe an approach to enhance the sensitivity of an online comprehensive two-dimensional liquid chromatography (LC x LC) high-resolution mass spectrometry method for the separation and detection of trace levels of anabolic-steroid residues in complex urine matrices.
   Compared to one-dimensional liquid chromatography (1D-LC), LC x LC methods offer higher separation power, thanks to the combined effect of two different selectivities and a higher peak capacity. However, when using state-of-the-art LC x LC instrumentation, the price paid for the increase in separation power is a decrease in sensitivity and detectability of trace-level analytes. This can be ascribed to the sample dilution that takes place during each of the two chromatographic steps. The way in which fractions are collected and transferred from the first to the second column is also of paramount importance, especially the volume and the solvent composition of the fractions injected in the second column.
   To overcome the detection limitation, we present an active-modulation strategy, based on concentrating the fractions of the first-dimension effluent using a modulation interface that employs trap columns. We obtained a signal enhancement for anabolic-steroid compounds in a bovine-urine sample by a factor of 2.4-7.6 and an increase in the signal-to-noise ratio up to a factor of 7 in comparison with a standard loop-based modulation interface. In addition, thanks to the increased sensitivity of our method, a substantially larger number of peaks were detected (76 vs. 36). Moreover, we could reduce the solvent consumption by a factor of three (160 mL vs. 500 mL per run). (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Two-dimensional (2D) liquid chromatography (LC)-tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) are typically employed for deep bottom-up proteomics, and the state-of-the-art 2D-LC-MS/MS has approached over 8000 protein identifications (IDs) from mammalian cell lines or tissues in 1-3 days of mass spectrometer time. Capillary zone electrophoresis (CZE)-MS/MS has been suggested as an alternative to LC-MS/MS for bottom-up proteomics. CZE-MS/MS and LC-MS/MS are complementary in protein/peptide ID from complex proteome digests because CZE and LC are orthogonal for peptide separation. In addition, the migration time of peptides from CZE-MS can be predicted accurately, which is invaluable for evaluating the confidence of peptide ID from the database search and even guiding the database search. However, the number of protein IDs from complex proteomes using CZE-MS/MS is still much lower than the state of the art using 2D-LC-MS/MS. In this work, for the first time, we established a strong cation exchange (SCX)-reversed phase LC (RPLC)-CZE-MS/MS platform for deep bottom-up proteomics. The platform identified around 8200 protein groups and 65,000 unique peptides from a mouse brain proteome digest in 70 h. The data represents the largest bottom-up proteomics dataset using CZE-MS/MS and provides a valuable resource for further improving the tool for prediction of peptide migration time in CZE. The peak capacity of the orthogonal SCX-RPLC-CZE platform was estimated to be around 7000. SCX-RPLC-CZE-MS/ MS produced comparable numbers of protein and peptide IDs with 2D-LC-MS/MS (8200 vs. 8900 protein groups, 65,000 vs. 70,000 unique peptides) from the mouse brain proteome digest using comparable instrument time. This is the first time that CZE-MS/MS showed its capability to approach comparable performance to the state-of-the-art 2D-LC-MS/MS for deep proteomic sequencing. SCX-RPLC-CZE-MS/MS and 2D-LC-MS/MS showed good complementarity in protein and peptide IDs and combining those two methods improved the number of protein group and unique peptide IDs by nearly 10% and over 40%, respectively, compared with 2D-LC-MS/MS alone.

AB Blood-based liquid biopsies provide a minimally invasive alternative to identify cellular and molecular signatures that can be used as biomarkers to detect early-stage cancer, predict disease progression, longitudinally monitor response to chemotherapeutic drugs, and provide personalized treatment options. Specific targets in blood that can be used for detailed molecular analysis to develop highly specific and sensitive biomarkers include circulating tumor cells (CTCs), exosomes shed from tumor cells, cell-free circulating tumor DNA (cfDNA), and circulating RNA. Given the low abundance of CTCs and other tumor-derived products in blood, clinical evaluation of liquid biopsies is extremely challenging. Microfluidics technologies for cellular and molecular separations have great potential to either outperform conventional methods or enable completely new approaches for efficient separation of targets from complex samples like blood. In this article, we provide a comprehensive overview of blood-based targets that can be used for analysis of cancer, review microfluidic technologies that are currently used for isolation of CTCs, tumor derived exosomes, cfDNA, and circulating RNA, and provide a detailed discussion regarding potential opportunities for microfluidics-based approaches in cancer diagnostics.

AB DNA-based switches are structure-switching biomolecules widely employed in different bioanalytical applications. Of particular interest are DNA-based switches whose activity is regulated through the use of allostery. Allostery is a naturally occurring mechanism in which ligand binding induces the modulation and fine control of a connected biomolecule function as a consequence of changes in concentration of the effector. Through this general mechanism, many different allosteric DNA-based switches able to respond in a highly controlled way at the presence of a specific molecular effector have been engineered. Here, we discuss how to design allosterically regulated DNA-based switches and their applications in the field of molecular sensing, diagnostic and drug release. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB This work reports a simple voltammetric method for the determination of chloride, bromide, and iodide ions using screen-printed carbon electrodes modified with silver nanoparticles electrochemically deposited on the working electrode surface. UV/Vis absorption spectroelectrochemistry was used to study the electrodeposition of silver nanoparticles on the working carbon electrode on PET or Gore-Tex (R) supports, and their subsequent oxidation in the presence of halide ions. The main figures of merit of the developed sensors, such as reproducibility and detection limit, have been calculated. Reproducibility values of 2.22%, 2.83% and 3.23% were obtained for chloride, bromide and iodide determinations, respectively. Additionally, the lowest detected amount of chloride, bromide and iodide ions were 3.0.10(-6) M, 5.0.10(-6) M and 5.0.10(-6) M, respectively. Taking into account the relevance of the determination of chloride ion concentration in sweat, the voltammetric method for the determination of halides has been successfully transferred to a Gore-Tex (R) support to build a first approach to a wearable sensor that facilitates the quantification of this ion in sweat samples. The Gore-Tex (R) sensor provides a good reproducibility (RSD = 1.61%). (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB In this study, we report the photo-induced electron transfer (PET) on parchment paper using riboflavin as a photo inducer and ultraviolet lamp (362 nm) as the light source. To this end, a conventional inkjet printer equipped with 4 cartridges was used. Parchment paper was found to be a favorable substrate due to its insignificant self-absorption while assisting efficient sample interaction. Upon UV-irradiation, riboflavin generated superoxide anion radical (O-2(-center dot)) and it was available to interact with superoxide dismutase present on the same spot. A decrease in NBT formazan in the reaction spot indicates increased O-2(-center dot) scavenging activity of molecule. It was estimated that the well-plate based-colorimetric method used 12.5 mu M (1.25 x 10(-8) mole) of riboflavin and 0.25 mM (2.50 x 10(-8) mole) of NBT to react with different superoxide dismutase or drug concentrations, while the printing technique consumed 3.19 x 10(-13) mole of NBT and 2.98 x 10(-13) mole of riboflavin to react with gradient superoxide dismutase or drug concentration. In contrast to the conventional well plate method, inkjet printing-based molecular assay provides automatic delivery in the nanoliter range with precise time, which ensures four-to five-order lower reagent consumption. The inkjet printing-based quantitative measurement specifies the amount of a particular drug/enzyme printed on a surface. Therefore, applicability of inkjet printing technique conjoined radical scavenging assay will be more competent to determine the radical scavenging potential of natural plant products. In addition, this inkjet printing approach offers easy, fast, cost-effective, and less time-consuming method to determine PET reaction on paper. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This work describes a simple and sensitive fluorescent method for detection of hydroquinone utilizing conjugated polymer nanoparticles (CPNs). The CPNs serve both as a catalyst to accelerate the conversion of hydroquinone to benzoquinone and a fluorescent probe. In the presence of hydroquinone, the fluorescence of CPNs can be effectively quenched by benzoquinone. The detection limit of hydroquinone was down to 5 nM and excellent selectivity toward possible interferences was obtained. This method was successfully applied for hydroquinone detection in lake water and satisfactory results were achieved. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A novel fluorescent biosensor for protein kinase activity (PKA) detection was designed by applying double-strands DNA-hosted copper nanoclusters (dsDNA-CuNCs) and graphene oxide (GO). One DNA strand of the dsDNA consisted of two domains, one domain can hybridize with another complementary DNA strand to stabilize the fluorescent CuNCs and another domain was adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP) aptamer. ATP aptamer of the dsDNA-CuNCs would be spontaneously absorbed onto the GO surface through pi-pi stacking interactions. Thus GO can efficiently quench the fluorescence (FL) of dsDNA-CuNCs through fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET). In the present of ATP, ATP specifically combined with ATP aptamer to form ATP-ATP aptamer binding complexes, which had much less affinity to GO, resulting in the fluorescence recovery of the system. Nevertheless, in the presence of PKA, ATP could be translated into ADP and ADP could not combine with ATP aptamer resulting in the fluorescence quenching of dsDNA-CuNCs again. According to the change of the fluorescence signal, PKA activity could be successfully monitored in the range of 0.1-5.0 U mL(-1) with a detection limit (LOD) of 0.039 U mL(-1). Besides, the inhibitory effect of H-89 on PKA activity was studied. The sensor was performed for PKA activity detection in cell lysates with satisfactory results. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB A novel type of stimuli-responsive fluorescent polymers has been developed via the self-assembly of riboflavin-5'-phosphate (Rif)) as ligand and europium (III) (Eu3+) as central metal ion coordinated with the ligand. The as-prepared RiP/Eu3+ coordination polymers (RiP/Eu3+ CPs) are smart and multifunctional for respectively responding to chemical and physical stimuli, in which RiP acts as the stimuli-responsive fluorescent signal indicator. For sensing chemical stimuli, 2,6-pyridinedicarboxylic acid (DPA, an anthrax biomarker) having higher bonding force towards Eu3+ can grab it from smart RiP/Eu3+ CPs through competition reaction, resulting in the release of RiP for highly sensitive and selective DPA monitoring in a mix-and-read fluorescent enhancement format, and the detection limit is as low as 41.5 nM. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations has been also performed to verify the DPA sensing principle. For sensing physical stimuli, the smart RiP/Eu3+ CPs can be acting as a novel sensory probe for the determination of temperature from 10 degrees C to 40 degrees C based on the thermal-induced disruption of the binding between Eu3+ and RiP and the disassembly of the smart RiP/Eu3+ CPs accompanying with the recovery of the fluorescence of RiP. This work establishes an effective platform for multifunctional sensing of chemical and physical stimuli utilizing both smart lanthanide nanoscale coordination polymers (LNCPs) and novel sensing strategies.

AB Phenylamine has been recognized as one of the most important industrially relevant ingredient and a crucial intermediate in chemical products. Yet, its internal exposure detection in human remains largely elusive due to the lack of potent monitoring method. Hereby this issue is addressed with a probe based on lanthanide functionalized organic-inorganic hybrid material Al(OH)(bpydc) (1) through post-synthetically modified metal-organic framework. The as-synthesized Tb3+@1 exhibits the strong luminescence of Tb3+ originated from efficient energy transfer from the ligand, which can sense the biological metabolite p-aminophenol (PAP) of the phenylamine in the human urine. Linear correlation between the integrated fluorescence intensity and the concentration of PAP was investigated, enabling quantitative analysis of PAP in physiologically ranges (0.005-5 mg mL(-1)) with low detection limit (5 mu g mL(-1)). This probe demonstrates excellent sensitivity, high selectivity, good reusability and quick response to PAP. Furthermore, a simple and rapid smartphone-based medical portable test paper was developed, whose quantitative color change can be easily distinguished visually. Hence, the PAP sensing platform can serve as a potential diagnostic tool for home monitoring of PAP. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In the present study, molecular modeling and principle component analysis (PCA) were used to select appropriate haptens for group detection of triazine herbicides. Four new structures together with three reported triazine derivatives were chosen for the screening of immunizing and coating haptens. A total of 31 triazines coupled with a 3D-QSAR methodology were employed to investigate the relationship between antigen-antibody recognition and molecular structures, the results of which revealed that the antibodies may recognize triazines from the side of molecules with the distinguishing atom and a steric volume matching with the spatial structure of antibodies. Finally, a broad-specificity heterologous immunoassay was developed for determining 10 triazine herbicides in ginger, where the detection limits were 2.5-15. mu g kg(-1) and recoveries were 67.9-102.6%. This study may broaden insight into triazine-antibody interactions and benefit designing novel performance-enhanced antibodies. The developed immunoassay can be further used for triazine detection in other complicated matrices. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A new label-free electrochemical immunosensor is constructed for the selective and sensitive determination of the clinically relevant biomarker receptor tyrosine kinase (AXL) in human serum. The disposable immunosensing platform is prepared by immobilization of the specific anti-AXL antibody onto amine functionalized graphene quantum dots (fGQDs)-modified screen-printed carbon electrodes (SPCEs). The affinity reactions were monitored by measuring the decrease in the differential pulse voltammetric (DPV) response of the redox probe Fe(CNI)(6)(3-/4-). All the experimental variables involved in the preparation of the modified electrodes and in the immunosensor performance were optimized. The as prepared immunosensor exhibits an improved analytical performance with respect to other electrochemical immunosensors reported so far, with a wider range of linearity and a lower detection limit, 0.5 pg mL(-1), which is more than one hundred thousand times lower than the established cut-off value for heart failure (HF) diagnosis in serum (71 ng mL(-1)). The developed immunosensor was successfully applied to the determination of the endogenous content of AXL in serum of HF patients without any matrix effect observed after just a sample dilution.

AB A novel analytical method based on magnetic solid-phase extraction (MSPE) coupled with high performance liquid chromatography-diode array detection (HPLC-DAD) was established for three herbicides simultaneous determination. The key of the method was the explored extractant, which was a composite of hollow carbon nanospheres (HCSs) enhanced magnetic carboxylic MWCNTs- (HCSs@Fe3O4-MWCNTs-COOH). MWCNTs-COOH was inserted in the pores of HCSs by oscillation and sonication with the capillary forces, making the carboxylic groups and structure intervals of the composite increase as compared to MWCNTs-COOH, therefore the extractant exhibited enhanced hydrophilicity, dispersibility, adsorptivity and selectivity. The extractant was sensitive to analytes with the structure of multi-aromatic ring, more hydrogen bond acceptor and large molecular polar surface area, which can be attributed to hydrogen bonding and pi-pi electron-donor-acceptor (EDA) interactions. The morphology, structure and magnetic property of the extractant were characterized. Then the explored extractant based MSPE-HPLC-DAD method was applied for bifenox (BFO), dichlobenil (DCB) and diclofop methyl (DCM) determination from wheat flour samples. Prior to real sample analysis, critical extraction parameters such as solution pH, extraction time, salt addition and temperature were investigated and optimized, and the analytical method was evaluated. It was indicated that the method had satisfactory linearities with the linear coefficients above 0.99, good precision with the RSD less than 3.5%, desirable recoveries ranged from 88.8% to 96.6%, and low limits of detection (LOD) that were 0.39, 0.24, and 0.68 ng/g for DCB, BFO and DCM, respectively. The established MSPE-HPLC-DAD method has great potentials for trace polar herbicides selective determination from complex matrix samples. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Efficient extraction of perfluorocarboxylic acids (PFCAs) is a key step for the accurate and sensitive determination of PFCAs due to their low concentration and the complexity of sample matrices. Herein, according to the chemical characteristics of PFCAs, a new adsorbent based on poly (2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,6,6,7,7-dodecafluoroheptyl acrylate/(vinylbenzyl)trimethylammonium chloride-co-divinylbenzene/ethylenedimethacrylate) monolith was fabricated and utilized as the extraction medium of multiple monolithic fiber solid-phase microextraction (MMF-SPME). Results well indicted that the prepared monolithic adsorbent (MA) could efficient extract PFCAs through fluorophilic and anion-exchange interactions. Under the optimal conditions, the MA/MMF-SPME was combined with HPLC-MS/MS for the sensitive monitoring of ultra-trace PFCAs in water and milks samples. The limits of detection (S/N = 3) of the target PFCAs in water and milk samples were 0.40-4.40 ng/L and 0.9-12.1 ng/L, respectively. Furthermore, the proposed method also exhibited some merits including wide linear dynamic ranges, satisfactory sensitivity, good method precision and low consumption of sample and organic solvent. Isotope internal standard calibration curve method was used to quantify the concentration of PFCAs in real samples, and trace levels of PFCAs in tap water and milk samples had been successfully detected.

AB Electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) is one of the most prevalent techniques used to monitor protein/peptide oxidation induced by reactive oxygen species (ROSs). However, both corona discharge (CD) and electrochemistry (EC) can also lead to protein/peptide oxidation during ESI. Because the two types of oxidation occur almost simultaneously, determining the extent to which the two pathways contribute to protein/peptide oxidation is difficult. Herein, a time-resolved method was introduced to identify and differentiate CD- and EC-induced oxidation. Using this approach, we separated the instantaneous CD-induced oxidation from the hysteretic EC-induced oxidation, and the effects of the spray voltage and flow rate of the ESI source on both oxidation types were investigated with a home-made ESI source. For angiotensin II analogue (b-DRVYVHPF-y), the dehydrogenation and oxygenation species were the detected EC-induced oxidation products, while the oxygenation species were the major CD-induced oxidation products. This time-resolved approach was also applicable to a commercial HESI source, in which both CD and EC were responsible for hemoglobin and cytochrome c oxidation with upstream grounding while CD dominated the oxidation without upstream grounding.

AB Coenzyme Q (CoQ) is a redox active molecule that plays a fundamental role in mitochondrial energy generation and functions as a potent endogenous antioxidant. Redox ratio of CoQ has been suggested as a good marker of mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress. Nevertheless, simultaneous measurement of redox states of CoQ is challenging owing to its hydrophobicity and instability of the reduced form. In order to improve the analytical methodology, paying special attention to this instability, we developed a highly sensitive and selective high-resolution/accurate-mass (HR/AM) UHPLC-MS/MS method for the rapid determination of redox states of CoQ(9) and CoQ(10) by ultra-performance liquid chromatography-hybrid quadrupole-Orbitrap mass spectrometry. CoQs were extracted using hexane with the addition of butylated hydroxytoluene to limit oxidation during sample preparation. Chromatographic separation of the analytes was achieved on a Kinetex C-18 column with the isocratic elution of 5 mM ammonium formate in 2-propanol/methanol (60:40) within 4 min. A full MS/all ion fragmentation (AIF) acquisition mode with mass accuracy < 5 ppm was used for detection and determination of redox states of CoQ(9) and CoQ(10) in healthy mice tissues using reduced and oxidized CoQ(4) as internal standards. The validated method showed good linearity (r(2) >= 0.9991), intraday, inter-day precision (CVs <= 11.9%) and accuracy (RE <=+/- 15.2%). In contrast to existing methods, the current method offers enhanced sensitivity (up to 52 fold) with LOD and LOQ ranged from 0.01 to 0.49 ng mL(-1) and 0.04 -1.48 ng mL(-l), respectively. Moreover, we evaluated various diluents to investigate bench top stability (at 4 degrees C) of targeted analytes in tissue samples during LC-MS assay up to 24 h. Ethanol was determined to be an optimum diluent without any significant oxidation of reduced CoQ up to 24 h.

AB The sensitive detection of cancer-related genes is of great significance for early diagnosis and treatment of human cancers, and previous isothermal amplification sensing systems were often based on the reuse of target DNA, the amplification of enzymatic products and the accumulation of reporting probes. However, no reporting probes are able to be transformed into target species and in turn initiate the signal of other probes. Herein we reported a simple, isothermal and highly sensitive homogeneous assay system for tumor suppressor p53 gene detection based on a new autonomous DNA machine, where the signaling probe, molecular beacon (MB), was able to execute the function similar to target DNA besides providing the common signal. In the presence of target p53 gene, the operation of DNA machine can be initiated, and cyclical nucleic acid strand-displacement polymerization (CNDP) and nicking/polymerization cyclical amplification (NPCA) occur, during which the MB was opened by target species and cleaved by restriction endonuclease. In turn, the cleaved fragments could activate the next signaling process as target DNA did. According to the functional similarity, the cleaved fragment was called twin target, and the corresponding fashion to amplify the signal was named twin target self-amplification. Utilizing this newly-proposed DNA machine, the target DNA could be detected down to 0.1 pM with a wide dynamic range (6 orders of magnitude) and single-base mismatched targets were discriminated, indicating a very high assay sensitivity and good specificity. In addition, the DNA machine was not only used to screen the p53 gene in complex biological matrix but also was capable of practically detecting genomic DNA p53 extracted from A549 cell line. This indicates that the proposed DNA machine holds the potential application in biomedical research and early clinical diagnosis. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A rapid, simple and affordable method for arsenic speciation analysis is described in this work. The proposed methodology involves in situ arsine generation, transfer of the volatile to the headspace and its reaction with silver nitrate at the detection zone of a paper-based analytical device (PAD). Thus, silver nitrate acts as a recognition element for arsine in the paper-based sensor. The chemical reaction between the recognition element and the analyte derivative results in the formation of a colored product which can be detected by scanning the detection zone and data treatment with an image processing and analysis program. Detection and injection zones were defined in the paper substrate by formation of hydrophobic barriers, thus enabling the formation of the volatile derivative without affecting the chemical stability of the recognition element present in the PAD. Experimental parameters influencing the analytical performance of the methodology, namely color mode detection, composition of the paper-based sensor and hydride generation and mass transfer conditions, were evaluated. Under optimal conditions, the proposed method showed limits of detection and quantification of 1.1 and 3.6 ng mL(-1), respectively. Remarkably, the limit of detection of the method reported herein was much lower than the maximum contaminant levels set by both the World Health Organization and the US Environmental Protection Agency for arsenic in drinking water, unlike several commercially available arsenic test kits. The repeatability, expressed as relative standard deviation, was found to be 7.1% (n = 8). The method was validated against the European Reference Material ERM (R)-CA615 groundwater and successfully applied to the determination of As(III), As(V) and total inorganic As in different water samples. Furthermore, the method can be used for the screening analysis of total arsenic in waters when a cut-off level of 7 ng mL(-1) is used. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Glutathione peroxidase 1 (Gpx1), one of the most responsive selenoproteins to the variation of selenium concentration, is often used to evaluate "selenium status" at a cellular or organismal level. The four major types of analytical methodologies to quantify Gpx1 were revisited. They include (i) an enzymatic assay, (ii, iii) polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) with (ii) western blot detection of protein or (iii) inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP MS) detection of selenium, and (iv) size-exclusion chromatography with ICP MS detection. Each of the four methods was optimized for the quantification of Gpx1 with maximum sensitivity. The methods based on the enzymatic and immunodetection offer a much higher sensitivity but their accuracy is compromised by the limited selectivity and limited dynamic range. The advantages, drawbacks and sources of error of each technique are critically discussed and the need for the cross-validation of the results using the different techniques to assure the quality assurance of quantitative analysis is emphasized.

AB A new multivariate regression model, named Error Covariance Penalized Regression (ECPR) is presented. Following a penalized regression strategy, the proposed model incorporates information about the measurement error structure of the system, using the error covariance matrix (ECM) as a penalization term. Results are reported from both simulations and experimental data based on replicate mid and near infrared (MIR and NIR) spectral measurements. The results for ECPR are better under non-iid conditions when compared with traditional first-order multivariate methods such as ridge regression (RR), principal component regression (PCR) and partial least-squares regression (PLS).

AB A novel conjugated microporous polymer based on perylene tetraanhydride bisimide (DP(2)A(2)) has been synthesized through Sonogashira-Hagihara cross-coupling polymerization of tetrabromo-substituted perylene tetraanhydride bisimide derivative (DPBr(2)ABr(2)) with 1,4-diethynylbenzene, whose Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) specific surface area is about 378 m(2) g(-1). The fluorescence quenching behaviors of the DP(2)A(2) were investigated. It is found that the DP(2)A(2) shows high sensitivity and selectivity to tracing o-nitrophenol (o-NP) in THE with Ks(v) constant of 2.00 x 10(4) L mol(-1). The detection limit (LOD) is 1.50 x 10(-9) mol L--(1). The possible sensing mechanism for the luminescent quenching of DP(2)A(2) towards o-NP exciting at 365 nm was considered the donor-acceptor electron transfer mechanism, which is a combined result from both dynamic (collisional) and static quenching. Moreover, the static quenching process is dominant for DP(2)A(2). (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Atomization conditions for antimony hydride in the plasma atomizer based on a dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) with atomic absorption spectrometric detection were optimized. Argon was found as the best discharge gas under a flow rate of 50 mL min(-1) while the DBD power was optimum at 30 W. Analytical figures of merit including interference study of As, Se and Bi have been subsequently investigated and the results compared to those found in an externally heated quartz tube atomizer (QTA). The limit of detection (LOD) reached in DBD (0.15 ng mL(-1) Sb) is comparable to that observed in QTA (0.14 ng mL(-1) Sb). Finally, possibility of Sb preconcentration by stibane in situ trapping in a DBD atomizer was studied. For trapping time of 300 s, the preconcentration efficiency and LOD, respectively, were 103 +/- 2% and 0.02 ng mL(-1). (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A simple and automated system based on combustion followed by a pyrohydrolysis reaction was proposed for further halogens determination. This system was applied for digestion of soils containing high (90%) and also low (10%) organic matter content for further halogens determination. The following parameters were evaluated: sample mass, use of microcrystalline cellulose and heating time. For analytes absorption, a diluted alkaline solution (6 mL of 25 mmol L-1 NH4OH) was used in all experiments. Up to 400 mg of soil with high organic matter content and 100 mg of soil with low organic matter content (mixed with 400mg of cellulose) could be completely digested using the proposed system. Quantitative results for all halogens were obtained using less than 12 min of sample preparation step (about 1.8 min for sample combustion and 10 min for pyrohydrolysis). The accuracy was evaluated using a certified reference material of coal and spiked samples. No statistical difference was observed between the certified values and results obtained by the proposed method. Additionally, the recoveries obtained using spiked samples were in the range of 98-103% with relative standard deviation values lower than 5%. The limits of quantification obtained for F, Cl, Br and I for soil with high (400 mg of soil) and low (100 mg of soil) organic matter were in the range of 0.01-2 mg g(-1) and 0.07-59 mg g(-1), respectively. The proposed system was considered as a simple and suitable alternative for soils digestion for further halogens determination by ion chromatography and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry techniques.

AB Glucose enzyme biosensors have been used for a variety of applications such as medical diagnosis, bioprocess engineering, beverage industry and environmental scanning etc. and there is still a growing interest in glucose sensors. For this purpose, addressed herein, as a novel glucose sensor, highly sensitive activated carbon (AC) decorated monodisperse nickel and palladium alloy nanocomposites modified glassy carbon electrode (Ni-Pd@AC/GCE NCs) have been synthesized by in-situ reduction technique. Raman Spectroscopy (RS), X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS), X-ray Diffraction (XRD), Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM), cyclic voltammetry (CV) and chronoamperometry (CA) were used for the characterization of the prepared non-enzymatic glucose sensor. The characteristic sensor properties of the Ni-Pd@AC/GCE electrode were compared with Ni-Pd NCs/GCE, Ni@AC/GCE and Pd@AC/GCE and the results demonstrate that the AC is very effective in the enhancement of the electrocatalytic properties of sensor. In addition, the Ni-Pd@AC/GCE nanocomposites showed a very low detection limit of 0.014 mM, a wide linear range of 0.01 mM(-1) mM and a very high sensitivity of 90 mA mM(-1) cm(-2). Furthermore, the recommended sensor offer the various advantageous such as facile preparation, fast response time, high selectivity and sensitivity. Lastly, monodisperse Ni-Pd@AC/GCE was utilized to detect glucose in real sample species. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Thermal desorption electrospray ionization/mass spectrometry (TD-ESI-MS) employing a quickly interchangeable ionization source is a relatively new ambient ionization mass spectrometric technique that has had, to date, only a limited number of applications related to food safety control. With reallocation of resources, this direct-analysis technique has had wider use in food analysis when operated in dual-working mode (pretreatment-free qualitative screening and conventional quantitative confirmation) after switching to an ambient ionization source from a traditional atmospheric pressure ionization source. Herein, we describe the benefits and challenges associated with the use of a TD-ESI source to detect adulterants in processed vegetables (PVs), as a proof-of-concept for the detection of basic colorants. While TD-ESI can offer direct qualitative screening analyses for PVs with detection capabilities lower than those provided with liquid chromatography/UV detection within 30 s, the use of TD-ESI for semi-quantification is applicable only for homogeneous food matrices.

AB Single strand DNA (ssDNA) chimeras consisting of a silver nanoclusters-nucleating sequence (NC) and an aptamer are widely employed to synthesize functional silver nanoclusters (AgNCs) for sensing purpose. Despite its simplicity, this chimeric-templated AgNCs often leads to undesirable turn-off effect, which may suffer from false positive signals caused by interference. In our effort to elucidate how the relative position of NC and aptamer affects the fluorescence behavior and sensing performance, we systematically formulated these NC and aptamer regions at different position in a DNA chimera. Using adenosine aptamer as a model, we tested the adenosine-induced optical response of each design. We also investigated the effect of linker region connecting NC and aptamer, as well as different NC sequence on the sensing performance. We concluded that locating NC sequence at 5'-end exhibited the best response, with immediate fluorescence enhancement observed over a wide linear range (1-2500 mu M). Our experimental findings help to explain the emission behavior and sensing performance of chimeric conjugates of AgNCs, providing an important means to formulate a better aptasensor.

AB Bilayer pseudo-stationary phase micellar liquid chromatography (MLC) was developed for simultaneous isocratic isolation of hydrochlorothiazide, as a basic-polar (hydrophilic) cardiovascular drug, as well as triamterene and losartan potassium, as acidic-nonpolar (hydrophobic) cardiovascular drugs. Utilizing a deep eutectic solvent (DES), as a novel green mobile phase additive in combination with acetonitrile (ACN) and acetic acid (ACA), drastically improved the chromatographic behavior of the drugs. Concentration of sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS), as well as volume percentages of ACN, DES, and ACA were optimized by using a central composite design. The optimal composition of the mobile phase (0.12 mol L-1 SDS, 5% ACN, 4% DES, and 2% ACA) was chosen through the desirability function. The chromatographic peaks of both hydrophilic and hydrophobic drugs, respectively, emerged at high and low retention time values in the shortest total analysis time of 20 min (at a flow rate of 2 mL min(-1)). Analytical characterization of the developed approach was investigated through Food and Drug Administration (FDA) guidelines. Applicability of the method was evaluated by analysing of human plasma samples which were directly injected into the system. (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The detection and discrimination of volatile carboxylic acid components, which are the main contributors to human body odor, have a wide range of potential applications. Here, a quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) sensor array based on molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP) nanobeads is developed for highly sensitive and selective sensing of typical carboxylic acid vapors, namely: propionic acid (PA), hexanoic acid (HA) and octanoic acid (OA). The MIP nanobeads were prepared by precipitation polymerization with methacrylic acid (MAA) as a functional monomer, trimethylolproane trimethacrylate (TRIM) as a crosslinker, and carboxylic acids (PA, HA and OA) as the template molecules. The precipitation polymerization resulted in nano-sized (150-200 nm) polymer beads with a regular shape. The polymerization conditions were optimized to give a functional monomer, crosslinker, and template ratio of 1:1:2. We investigated the imprinting effect using both QCM and GC/MS measurements comparing vapor absorption characteristics between the imprinted and non-imprinted (NIP) nanobeads. A four-channel QCM sensory array based on the NIP and the three types of MIP nanobeads was fabricated for sensing the three types of carboxylic acid vapor at concentrations on the ppm level. The output of the sensor array was analyzed by both a non-supervised method (principle component analysis: PCA) and supervised method (linear discrimination analysis: LDA). LDA showed a better discrimination ability than PCA. A 96%-classification rate was achieved by applying leave-one-out cross-validation to the LDA model. The high sensitivity and selectivity of the sensor array was attributed to the imprinting effect of the nanosized polymer beads. The developed MIP nanobeads, together with other types of MIPs, show promise as materials for artificial receptors in vapor and odorant sensing. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A modified algorithm for training a restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM) has been devised and demonstrated for improving the results for partial least squares (PLS) calibration of wheat and meat by near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy. In all cases, the PLS calibrations improved by using the abstract features generated from the RBM so long as the nonlinear mapping increased the dimensionality. The evaluations were validated using bootstrapped Latin partitions (BLPs) with 5 bootstraps and 3-Latin partitions which proved useful because of the statistical learning and random initial conditions of the RBM networks. By using a noise decay parameter, initial large amounts of noise could be used and the benefits of simulated annealing achieved as the noise level is slowly decreased. This paper demonstrates for the first time that using abstract features and enlarging the spectral data can improve the calibration results and exemplifies the Copiosity Principle. Two NIR reference datasets were evaluated. The first set of wheat spectra was calibrated for protein concentration and the second set of meat spectra was calibrated for moisture, fat, and protein concentration. The RBM feature extraction improved the linearity of the models and reduced embedded noise. The RBM also can help eliminate some difficult spectral preprocessing stages such as variable alignment and feature selection. RBMs benefit from derivative preprocessing of the NIR spectra or other preprocessing that enhances the differences among the spectra. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Poly(thymine)-hosted copper nanoparticles (poly T-CuNPs) have emerged as a promising label-free fluorophore for bioanalysis, but its application in RNA-related studies is still rarely explored. Herein, by utilizing duplex-specific nuclease (DSN) as a convertor to integrate target recycling mechanism into terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT)-mediated superlong poly T-CuNPs platform, a specific and sensitive method for microRNA detection has been developed. In this strategy, a 30-phosphorylated DNA probe can hybridize with target RNA and then be cut by DSN to produce 30-hydroxylated fragments, which can be further tailed by TdT with superlong poly T for fluorescent CuNPs synthesis. As proof of concept, an analysis of let-7d was achieved with a good linear correlation between 20 and 1000 pM (R-2 = 0.9965) and a detection limit of 20 pM. Moreover, both homologous and heterologous microRNAs were also effectively discriminated. This strategy might pave a brand-new way for designing label-free and sensitive microRNA assays.

AB A novel "turn-on" fluorescence probe (HHC)(2)-Cu2+ for sulfide (S2-) was synthesized and characterized based on dihydroxyhemicyanine-Cu2+ complex. The probe displayed high sensitivity and selectivity for S2- over other analytes, including biothiols, NaCN, reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS) in aqueous solution, which was attributed to the large association constant and the fast kinetics of precipitation of CuS. The probe (HHC)(2)-Cu2+ can be regenerated and reversibly detected with S2- with a remarkable red-fluorescent change by alternating the addition of S2- and Cu2+. Fluorescent spectra of (HHC)(2)-Cu2+ toward S2- showed a high selectivity, a good linearity, a low limit of detection at 0.12 mu M, a rapid response time (less than 30 s), and a wide pH range of 7-10. Importantly, the probe was successfully applied to detect the low level of S2- in waste water samples, corrupt blood samples, and living cells.

AB A method for the determination of non-lactose oligosaccharides (NLO) in milk using liquid chromatography has been developed. Oligosaccharides were labelled with a fluorescent tag, 2-aminobenzamide (2AB), and were identified by comparison of their retention times to those of oligosaccharide standards, their mass (as measured by mass spectrometry) and their fragmentation patterns in the mass spectrometer. The concentrations of the NLO in milk have been determined using 2 different approaches: (1) by preparing a calibration curve using genuine standards of each oligosaccharide. (2) by preparing a calibration curve using maltotriose as a universal standard for all NLO, and assuming all 2AB labelled oligosaccharides give an equimolar response in the detector. The accuracy of the method was assessed by spike-recovery experiments. Using genuine NLO standards for calibration, recoveries were in the range 96-114%. Using maltotriose as a universal calibrant, recoveries were in the range 86-120%. Method precision was assessed by determining the relative standard deviation of the results under repeatability (RSD(r)) and intermediate reproducibility (RSD(iR)) conditions. In most cases RSD(r) and RSD(iR) were below 5% irrespective of calibration method, but increased when NLO levels were close to LoQ. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Carbon Quantum Dots (CDs) owing to its unique photophysical properties have attracted immense consideration of the researchers in last decade to explore its applications in the fields of bio-imaging and sensing. In the present work, we have developed a novel CDs functionalized with Calix[4]arene derivative by hydrothermal route to detect biologically pertinent Zn2+ ions. Surface modification of CDs enhances fluorescence efficiency apart from introducing active surface sites broadening its sensor capabilities. The obtained surface-functionalized CDs exhibits a strong blue fluorescence under UV light (365 nm) with a quantum yield (Phi) of 56% which is appreciably good. Zn2+ ions get apprehended in the cavity formed due to passivation by Calix[4]arene moeity on the exterior of CDs having profuse -NH2 groups. Addition of Zn2+ ions into the solution of CDs results in remarkable enhancement in the fluorescence intensity attributed to Photo-induced Electron Transfer (PET) "OFF" phenomenon. The CDs based nanosensor exhibited a wide linear response with a detection limit of 7.34 nM. Significantly, CDs were shown to display insignificant cytotoxicity, decent biocompatibility, and virtuous resistance to photo-bleaching, good stability over a wide range of pH, insignificant variation in the emission intensity in the presence of high concentration of salt and excellent bio-labeling ability when tested on E. coli cell lines. Additionally, the detection results of Zn2+ ions obtained in real samples were in complete agreement with that obtained by Atomic Absorption Spectroscopy (AAS), signifying the prospective application of the proposed probe as a selective and sensitive sensor for Zn2+ ions. The proposed sensor was also applied for fluorescence imaging of intracellular Zn2+ ions. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Reports have indicated that warfarin is the most widely prescribed anticoagulant. However, traditionally prescribed doses for each patient may be too low or too high. The therapeutic effect is often hindered by a lack of evidence-based medical information. Herein, our aim is to provide this information. To accomplish this challenge, we report the development of a novel assay based on biotinylated tetrahedral DNA as a capture probe and fullerene (C-60)-based nanomaterial as a redox probe using an ultrasensitivity assay with the Vitamin K epoxide reductase complex, subunit 1 (VKORC1). Platinum porous nanoparticles (PtPNPs) were modified on amino-terminated polyamidoamine (PAMAM)-functionalized C-60 nanoparticles (C(60)NPs). The resultant C(60)NPs-PAMAM-PtPNPs were used as a redox probe. In this design, C-60 exhibited excellent redox activity that was triggered by tetraoctylammonium bromide (TOAB). To improve the immobilization of the tetrahedral DNA capture probe, avidin was introduced during the fabrication of the biosensor because it can provide more active sites for the immobilization capture probe. The free-standing probe on top of the tetrahedral DNA served as a receptor to hybridize with target DNA directly. Different pulse voltammetry (DPV) was applied to record the electrochemical signals, which increased linearly with the target DNA. Under optimal conditions, the prepared biosensor showed a wide linear relationship, from 1 pM to 10 nM, with detection limits of 0.33 pM. This strategy demonstrates a new avenue for the determination of tumour-related mutated nucleotides in biosamples. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB On-site sampling is an analytical approach that can ensure the accuracy of monitoring data and enhance the effectiveness of environmental protection measures. In the present work, an in-syringe solid-phase extraction (SPE) device was designed for on-site sampling of trace contaminants in environmental water samples followed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis. Template assisted freeze casting followed by hydrazine vapor reduction approach was used to synthesize a hierarchical porous graphene aerogel (HPGA), which was used as the sorbent in the in-syringe SPE device. Environmental degradable pyrethroids were selected as the model analytes. Owing to the large specific surface area and hydrophobicity of HPGA, the target molecules could be completely extracted during one aspirating/ dispensing cycle. The analytes were stable on the sorbent for at least 72 h when the device was stored under airtight and light-free conditions, and were not affected by the pH value of sample solution. All results demonstrated that the device could meet the requirements of on-site sampling. For practical application, the limits of detection were found to be in the range of 0.012-0.11 ng mL(-1) under the optimized conditions, and satisfactory recoveries in the range of 65.7-105.9% were obtained for the analysis of real samples. The results of this study demonstrate the immense potential of HPGA for the enrichment of trace environmental pollutants, and meanwhile promote the application of the in-syringe SPE technique as a promising candidate for on-site sampling.

AB In this paper, parallel artificial liquid membrane extraction (PALME) was used for the first time to cleanup dried blood spots (DBS) prior to ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS). Fundamental studies exploring amongst others desorption from the DBS in alkaline or acidic aqueous conditions, total extraction time and absolute recoveries were executed. Desorption and PALME were performed using a set of two 96-well plates, one of them housing the sample and the other comprising the supported liquid membrane (SLM) and the acceptor solution. In one procedure, amitriptyline and quetiapine (basic model analytes) were desorbed from the DBS using 250 mu L of 10 mM sodium hydroxide solution (aqueous), and subsequently extracted through the SLM consisting of 4 mu L of 1% trioctylamine in dodecyl acetate, and further into an acceptor solution consisting of 50 mu L of 20 mM formic acid. In a second procedure, ketoprofen, fenoprofen, flurbiprofen, and ibuprofen (acidic model analytes) were desorbed from the DBS into 20 mM formic acid, extracted through an SLM with dihexyl ether, and further into an acceptor solution of 25 mM ammonia. Within 60 min of PALME, both basic and acidic model analytes were effectively desorbed from the DBS and extracted into the acceptor solution, which was injected directly into the analytical instrument. Recoveries between 63 and 85% for the six model analytes were obtained. PALME provided excellent clean-up from the DBS samples, and acceptor solutions were free from phospholipids. Linearity was obtained with r(2) > 0.99 for five of the six analytes. Accuracy, precision and UHPLC-MS/MS matrix effects were in accordance with the European Medicines Agency (EMA) guideline. Based on these experiments, PALME shows great potential for future processing of DBS in a short and simple way, and with the presented setup, up to 96 DBS can be processed within a total extraction time of 60 min.

AB In this study, we report an electrochemical microbial biosensor that was made by immobilizing a bacterial laccase on the surface of Escherichia coli cells followed by adsorption of modified live cells onto a glassy-carbon electrode. Expression and surface localization of laccase on target cells were confirmed by Western blotting, flow cytometry assays and immunofluorescence microscopy observation. Increased tandem-aligned anchors with three repeats of the N-terminal domain of an ice nucleation protein were used to construct a highly active E. coli whole cell laccase-based catalytic system. When the proposed biosensor was used to detect catechol, the electrochemical response under optimized pH conditions was linear within a concentration range of 0.5 mu M-300.0 mu M catechol. Metal ions (Mn2+, Fe3+, Cu2+, Mg2+, Al3+ and Zn2+) at concentrations from 1 to 10 mg L-1, bovine serum albumin and glucose at concentrations from 0.1 to 10 g L-1, and ascorbic acid at concentrations from 0.01 to 0.1 g L-1 did not cause a noticeable interference effect. The detection limit of 0.1 mu M catechol was comparable to those of other biosensors based on purified chemically modified laccases. When used to detect catechol in real red wine and tea samples, the biosensor offered a considerable level of accuracy comparable to the HPLC method as well as high recovery rates (98.2%-103.8%) towards all of the tested samples. Moreover, the developed system also exhibited high stability and reproducibility. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In our work, a novel DNA electrochemiluminescence (ECL) sensor based on CuZnInS quantum dots (QDs) and gold-nanoparticles (Au NPs) is developed for highly sensitive detection of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) Gene, which has a close relation with the lung cancer. The CuZnInS QDs work as a novel kind of ECL luminophore, whose defect state emission is suitable for ECL sensing. To enhance the sensitivity of the sensing system, Au NPs are utilized creatively to strengthen the ECL intensity of CuZ-nInS QD(S) according to the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) effect. An ultrasensitive and universal detecting platform is built based on the SPR effect between Au NPs and CuZnInS QD(S). The effect of the capped stabilizer on the ECL signal of QDs is firstly investigated. Three different stabilizers are used to cap the CuZnInS QDs, including mercaptopropionic acid (MPA), L-glutathione (GSH) and cysteamine (CA). MPA capped CuZnInS QDs possess the strongest ECL intensity among the three kinds of the CuZnInS QDs. Under the optimum conditions, a good linear relationship between ECL intensity and the concentration of target DNA is obtained in the range from 0.05 nmol L-1 to 1 nmol L-1. The detection limit is 0.0043 nmol L-1. The proposed DNA sensor has been employed for the determination of target DNA EGFR in human serum samples with satisfactory results. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB Point-of-care biosensors are important tools developed to aid medical diagnosis and testing, food safety and environmental monitoring. Paper-based biosensors, especially nucleic acid-based lateral flow assays (LFA), are affordable, simple to produce and easy to use in remote settings. However, the sensitivity of such assays to infectious diseases has always been a restrictive challenge. Here, we have successfully electrospun polycaprolactone (PCL) on nitrocellulose (NC) membrane to form a hydrophobic coating to reduce the flow rate and increase the interaction rate between the targets and gold nanoparticles-detecting probes conjugates, resulting in the binding of more complexes to the capture probes. With this approach, the sensitivity of the PCL electrospin-coated test strip has been increased by approximately ten-fold as compared to the unmodified test strip. As a proof of concept, this approach holds great potential for sensitive detection of targets at point-of-care testing. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this paper, we report a simple one-step synthesis method for silver-gold bimetallic nanoparticles deposition on silver chloride nanosheets to form Ag-Au/AgCl nanohybrid with oxidase-like and peroxidase-like catalytic activity. We used these nanohybrid in the detection of spermine. First, 13 nm-sized Au NPs were synthesized by citrate reduction of HAuCl4 solution, and then, Ag+ ions were added to the solution without any purification. The added Ag+ reacted with the Cl- ions in the dispersion, thus immediately forming AgCl nanosheets through a precipitation reaction, and the aurophilic interactions with the Au NPs resulted in the formation and in situ self-deposition of Ag-Au NPs on the AgCl nanosheets at room temperature. We investigated the enzyme-mimicking activity of the Ag-Au/AgCl nanohybrid in detail via the O-2- or H2O2-Amplex Red (AR) redox system. The Ag-Au/AgCl nanohybrid exhibited at least 150-fold higher catalytic activity than that of Ag-Au NPs or AgCl nanosheets, due to synergistic effect. Spermine inhibited the enzyme-mimic activity of the Ag-Au/AgCl nanohybrid, thereby allowing for the construction of a probe for detecting nanomolar concentrations of spermine in urine samples. This cost-effective sensing system was used to easily and rapidly detect the concentrations of spermine in complex urine samples. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB We report the application of CSigma laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (C sigma-LIBS) to quantitative analysis of aluminum alloys without sample preparation. C sigma-LIBS simplifies strongly the conventional calibration procedure of LIBS, replacing it with a characterization stage performed from the spectrum of a single standard sample. The aim of this work has been to provide a complete evaluation of the use of C sigma-LIBS for direct analysis by obtaining its figures of merit, including precision and limits of detection. Ten elements (Si, Fe, Cu, Mn, Mg, Cr, Ni, Zn, Ti and Ca) are determined in a set of six certified samples with a wide range of concentrations, from percent down to mu g/g levels. The average precision is 8.0% for concentrations higher than 0.1 wt% and 13% for concentrations between 0.1 wt% and 0.01 wt%. The limits of detection are in the range 1.4-9.7 mu g/g.

AB Neural networks with random weights (NNRW) has been used for regression due to its excellent performance. However, NNRW is sensitive to outliers and unstable to some extent in dealing with the real-world complex samples. To overcome these drawbacks, a new method called robust boosting NNRW (RBNNRW) is proposed by integrating a robust version of boosting with NNRW. The method builds a large number of NNRW sub-models sequentially by robustly reweighted sampling from the original training set and then aggregates these predictions by weighted median. The performance of RBNNRW is tested with three spectral datasets of wheat, light gas oil and diesel fuel samples. As comparisons to RBNNRW, the conventional PLS, NNRW and boosting NNRW (BNNRW) have also been investigated. The results demonstrate that the introduction of robust boosting greatly enhances the stability and accuracy of NNRW. Moreover, RBNNRW is superior to BNNRW particularly when outliers exist.

AB Partial Least Squares Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA) is one of the most effective multivariate analysis methods for spectral data analysis, which extracts latent variables and uses them to predict responses. In particular, it is an effective method for handling high-dimensional and collinear spectral data. However, PLS-DA does not explicitly address data multimodality, i.e., within-class multimodal distribution of data. In this paper, we present a novel method termed nearest clusters based PLS-DA (NCPLS-DA) for addressing the multimodality and nonlinearity issues explicitly and improving the performance of PLS-DA on spectral data classification. The new method applies hierarchical clustering to divide samples into clusters and calculates the corresponding centre of every cluster. For a given query point, only clusters whose centres are nearest to such a query point are used for PLS-DA. Such a method can provide a simple and effective tool for separating multimodal and nonlinear classes into clusters which are locally linear and unimodal. Experimental results on 17 datasets, including 12 UCI and 5 spectral datasets, show that NCPLS-DA can outperform 4 baseline methods, namely, PLS-DA, kernel PLS-DA, local PLS-DA and k-NN, achieving the highest classification accuracy most of the time.

AB A novel QD-based immunoassay on a paper-based lateral flow system has been developed to quantitatively detect C-reactive protein (CRP). Different standard CRP antigens from 1 to 200 mu g mL(-1) were diluted 200-fold and only 60 mu L diluted sample were needed to load onto the sample pad. The QD fluorescence signals on the test line and the control line were able to be observed within 3 min after the initiation of assay, and the limit of detection was as sensitive as 0.30 ng mL(-1) by measuring the fluorescence intensity immediately afterwards with fluorescence immunoassay analyzer. The linearity on the detection of QD fluorescence signals has been established well in the range of 0.5 ng mL(-1) and 1 mu g mL(-1) for CRP. The precision of the assay has been confirmed for low coefficient of variation (CV), satisfying less than 15% (intra-assay and inter-assay), and the accuracy of assay meets the requirements with the mean recovery of the control was 102.63%. These results indicated that such newly developed platform was reliable with high sensitivity, rapidness, and could cover a broad range of target concentrations. Furthermore, a total of 135 human serum clinical samples with inflammation or infection with the concentration of CRP from 0.2 to 200 mu g mL(-1) has been used to check the performance of this QD-based LFIA, it correlated very well with Roche Tina-quant CRP (Latex) (r = 0.966, n = 135).

AB In this paper, we report an improved magnesium hydroxide, Mg(OH)(2), coprecipitation method for the determination of 16 trace elements (Al, V, Cr, Mn, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Ga, As, Se, Sb, Sn and Pb) and 18 rare earth elements (REEs), including Sc, Y, U and Th in seawater and estuarine water samples. The procedure involves coprecipitation of the trace elements and REEs on Mg(OH)(2) upon addition of a small volume of triethylamine (TEA) followed by analysis of the dissolved pellet solutions by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). Three-step sequential coprecipitation was carried out on 10 mL aliquots of seawater to eliminate the matrix ions and to preconcentrate the analytes of interest into a 1 mL final volume. Spike recoveries varied from 85% (Th) to 105% (Y). Calcium (Ca), sodium (Na) and potassium (K) matrices were virtually eliminated from the analysis solutions. Collision reaction interface (CRI) technology utilizing H-2 and He gases was employed to determine its effectiveness in removing the spectral interferences originating from the residual Mg matrix, TEA and plasma gases. H2 was more effective than He in reducing spectral interferences from TEA and plasma gases. Limits of detection (LODs) ranged from 0.01 ng L-1 (Ho) to 72 ng L-1 (Al). The method was validated by using certified seawater (CASS-4) and estuarine water (SLEW-3) reference materials. Precision for five (n = 5) replicate measurements were between 1.2% (Pr) and 18% (Lu). Fe, Pb, Sn, and Zn impurities in TEA were significant in comparison to the levels in CASS-4 and SLEW-3, while relatively high background signals impacted determinations of low levels of Sc and Th. The effects of these hurdles on precision and accuracy were alleviated by measuring these elements in spiked CASS-4 and SLEW-3. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The electrocatalytic oxidation of tartaric acid on a carbon paste electrode modified with cobalt (II)-phthalocyanine was demonstrated and applied to the development of a highly sensitive, simple, fast and inexpensive voltammetric sensor to determine tartaric acid. The electrochemical behavior of the modified electrode was investigated by cyclic and square wave voltammetry, and the effect of experimental variables, such as dispersion and loading of cobalt (II)-phthalocyanine, together with optimum conditions for sensing the analyte by square wave voltammetry were assessed. In addition, the absence of a significant memory effect combined with the ease of electrode preparation led to the development of a sensitive and direct method to determine tartaric acid in wines. Interferences from other low molecular weight organic acids commonly present in wines were circumvented by using a multiway calibration technique, successfully obtaining the second order advantage by modeling voltammetric data with unfolded partial least square with residual bilinearization (U-PLS/RBL). A linear response range between 10 and 100 mmol L-1 (r = 0.9991), a relative prediction error of 4.55% and a recovery range from 96.41 to 102.43% were obtained. The proposed method is non-laborious, since it does not use sample pretreatment such as filtration, extraction, pre-concentration or cleanup procedures. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The paper reports synthesis of gold-palladium nanowaxberries(AuPd NWs)/dodecylamine-functionalized graphene quantum dots(D-GQDs)-graphene micro-aerogel(GMA). D-GQDs was used as a solid particle surfactant for stabilizing Pickering emulsion of toluene-in-graphene oxide aqueous dispersion. Graphene oxide sheets in the aqueous phase are reduced by hydrazine hydrate, diffused into the toluene droplet and self-assembled into graphene oxide micro-gels. Followed by freeze-drying, thermal annealing and hybridized with AuPd NWs. The as-prepared AuPd NWs/D-GQDs-GMA shows an unique three-dimensional structure with the size of microns. The small size and strong polarity make it can be directly dispersed in ethanol to form stable dispersion for sensor preparation. The hybrid of GMA, D-GQDs and AuPd NWs greatly improves the electron transfer, electroactive surface area and ion diffusion. The architecture of conductor/semiconductor/conductor achieves to a significant amplification of detection signal. The DNA biosensor based on the AuPd NWs/D-GQDs-GMA exhibits ultrasensitive differential pulse voltammetric (DPV) response towards peanut allergen Ara h 1. The DPV signal linearly increases with increasing DNA concentration in the range of 1.0 x 10(-22)-1.0 x 10(-17) M with the detection limit of 4.7 x 10(-23) M(S/N = 3). The analytical method was successfully applied to voltammetric determination of peanut allergen Ara h 1 in peanut milk beverage. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this work, an innovative magnetic aptamer adsorbent (Fe3O4-aptamer MNPs) was synthesized for the selective extraction of 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG). Amino-functionalized-Fe3O4 was crosslinked with 8-OHdG aptamer by glutaraldehyde and fixed into a steel stainless tube as the sorbent of magnetic solid phase extraction (MSPE). After selective extraction by the aptamer adsorbent, the adsorbed 8-OHdG was desorbed dynamically and online analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS). The synthesized sorbent presented outstanding features, including specific selectivity, high enrichment capacity, stability and biocompatibility. Moreover, this proposed MSPE-HPLC-MS can achieve adsorption and desorption operation integration, greatly simplify the analysis process and reduce human errors. When compared with offline MSPE, a sensitivity enhancement of 800 times was obtained for the online method. Some experimental parameters such as the amount of the sorbent, sample flow rate and sample volume, were optimized systematically. Under the optimal conditions, low limit of detection (0.01 ngmL(-1), S/N = 3), limit of quantity (0.03 ng mL(-1), S/N = 10) and wide linear range with a satisfactory correlation coefficient (R-2 >= 0.9992) were obtained. And the recoveries of 8-OHdG in the urine samples varied from 82% to 116%. All these results revealed that the method is simple, rapid, selective, sensitive and automated, and it could be expected to become a potential approach for the selective determination of trace 8-OHdG in complex urinary samples.

AB A simple method for highly selective determination of trace and ultratrace arsenic ions, i.e. arsenite and arsenate, was developed. The method is based on new miniaturized membranes, 5 mm diameter and 4.4 mg weight, which are prepared by synthesis of amorphous silica coating on cellulose fibers followed by the modification with ( 3-mercaptopropyl)-trimethoxysilane. The batch adsorption experiments show that membranes have high selectivity toward arsenite in the presence of heavy metals and anions that usually exist in natural water. Arsenite can be quantitatively adsorbed at pH 1 from 50 mL sample within 60 min using the miniaturized membrane with maximum adsorption capacity of 60 mg g(-1). The excellent adsorptive properties of membranes open the path to simple and selective determination of trace and ultratrace arsenite in water. Moreover, the membranes can be applied in the arsenic speciation due to their selectivity toward arsenite in the presence of arsenate. After adsorption, the arsenite retained onto the membrane is directly measured by energy-dispersive X-ray fluorescence spectrometry, avoiding elution step usually required in other spectroscopy techniques. The method is characterized by excellent enrichment factor of 972, detection limit of 0.045 ng mL(-1) and can be successfully applied in analysis of high salinity water, which is difficult to analyze by other spectroscopy techniques. The proposed method is a solvent-free approach based on the use of miniaturized membranes as sorbent followed by the direct measurement using a low-power X-ray spectrometer without either elution step or gas consumption during measurement. It can be considered as environmentally friendly and meets the standards of green analytical chemistry principles. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Small molecule metabolites are widely used as biomarkers in the research field of metabolomics for disease diagnosis and exposure assessment. As a readily available biofluid containing plenty of volatile organic metabolites (VOMs), urine is ideal for non-invasive metabolomic analysis; however, there is still lack of rapid analysis method for VOMs in urine. Here we report a kind of rapid method for urine analysis by employing high-pressure photon ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (HPPI-TOFMS) combined with dynamic purge-injection. Various types of metabolites, such as ketones, alcohols, acids, sulfides, pyrroles and amines were detected directly by simple acidification or alkalization of urines. It is noteworthy that nitrogen-containing compounds, especially polar amines, could be ultrasensitively measured without any derivatization. The analytical capability of the direct HPPI-MS technique was demonstrated by analyzing five valuable metabolites, i.e., toluene, 2,5-dimethylpyrrole, trimethlyamine, styrene, and p-xylene, which exhibited relatively low limits of detection, wide linear range and satisfactory repeatability. Being highly sensitive and humidity-friendly, the whole analytical procedure is easily operated in less than 6 min. Interestingly, a new biomarker 2,5-dimethylpyrrole was exclusively found in the smoker's urine sample besides toluene. The work presents a novel tool for rapid nontarget disease biomarkers screening or target monitoring of specific compounds through the investigation of volatile metabolites in urine.

AB An amplified fluorescence biosensing strategy for serum prostate specific antigen (PSA) was developed on the basis of DNAzyme. In presence of cofactor Zn2+, Zn2+ -dependent DNAzyme could cleave the hairpin substrate probes which were dispersed in solution and generate remarkable fluorescent signal. Taking advantage of the magnetic beads as a carrier, one target protein could bring plentiful hairpin substrate probes on to the electrode through a sandwich structure (Ab(1)/PSA/biotin-Ab(2)). Moreover, during the cleavage process of as formed DNAzyme, DNAzyme did not be destroyed and could further react with other hairpin probes, then generated continuous fluorescent signal. Benefited by this amplified strategy, the limit of detection (LOD) was low to 0.05 ng mL(-1), which was much lower than our previous reports. This method could be applied to detect different protein biomarkers in serum without corresponding aptamers by changing the corresponding antibodies and thus showed a remarkable prospect in clinical application.

AB Hydride generation (HG) from arsenosugars (dimethylarsinoylribosides) in batch and flow injection modes was studied. Its efficiency was found higher in H2SO4 medium than in HCl and higher in the batch mode than in the flow injection mode. To increase the efficiency in the flow injection mode a new generator with two inlets of NaBH4 solution was designed. This modified generator was interfaced between a HPLC column and an atomic fluorescence detector. The arsenosugars studied yielded HG efficiencies in the range 13-30% most probably due to a complicated mechanism of HG. While the mechanism included a formation of two structures of the analyte-borane-complexes, only one of them can lead to a formation of volatile arsanes (dimethylarsane, methylarsane, and arsane were identified).

AB reconstruct I-131 deposition and identify the source of radioiodine due to the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant (FDNPP) accident, I-129 activity and I-129/I-127 atom ratio should be obtained by preparing and analyzing large numbers of samples economically. In this study, great efforts were made to realize mild TMAH (tetramethyl ammonium hydroxide) extraction of environmental samples at 90 degrees C to obtain solutions suitable for the following triple-quadrupole inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-QQQ) MS/MS mode analysis. After releasing iodine from organic matter in the TMAH extraction solution via K2S2O8 oxidation, organic matter was removed effectively by solvent extraction and back-extraction to avoid a serious matrix effect during ICP-QQQ analysis. At the same time, interfering elements, especially, Mo, Cd, and In were also removed effectively, to avoid their undesirable interferences during mass spectrometric analysis. In addition, 0.01% (NH4)(2)SO3 was selected to introduce I- into ICP-QQQ to ensure there was no memory effect and a stable signal was gotten. Subsequently, ICP-QQQ MS/MS mode was applied to further eliminate polyatomic interferences (I-127(H-2 and D)(+), (MoO2+)-Mo-97, (InO+)-In-113, and (CdO+)-Cd-113) and isobaric interference from Xe-129(+). Finally, the developed method was successfully applied to measure I-129/I-127 atom ratios ((2.61-27.0) x 10(-7)) and I-129 activities (3.51-11.4 mBq kg(-1)) in soil samples. The developed method allows a greater number of ordinary laboratories to participate in the field of radioiodine analysis. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Probe for dual-site target distinct subcellular compartments from cytosol and nucleus is an attractive approach, however, which was scarcely reported. Herein, a series of small-molecular thiophene pyridium salt derivatives (MitoNuc1-4) possessing water-soluble, high quantum yield and two-photon activity were rationally designed, and their structures were crystallographic confirmed. Systematic photophysical and biological imaging property investigations were carried out for them. It was found that MitoNuc1-4 exhibit two-photon absorption properties in the near infrared region, and MitoNuc1 has membrane permeability and cationic nature, rendering it to be double labelling of mitochondria and nucleolus in living cells with superb photo-stability and non-invasiveness. It also demonstrated that MitoNuc1 in living cells can monitor mitochondrial division in real time and revealed nucleolar ultrastructure under stimulated emission depletion nanoscopy.

AB Since abnormal metabolism of histidine (His) is defined as an indicator of several diseases, detection of His in biological fluids becomes increasingly urgent to us. However, due to similar structures and properties of different amino acids, selective quantification of His is difficulty, and typically needs the participation of special reagents. In this work, we report for the first time that nickel ions (Ni2+) can induce the allostery of G-quadruplex, and is thus able to manipulate the activity of G-quadruplex DNAzyme. Experimental results indicate the interaction between Ni2+ and guanine is critical to the allostery. In comparison with Ni2+-guanine interaction, Ni2+-His interaction exhibits higher affinity. Therefore, a colorimetric His biosensor is fabricated, and His can be facilely discriminated by naked eyes. Relying on the high activity of DNAzyme, His in a range of 50 nM-400 mu M is determined with this method, and low detection limit (36 nM) is obtained. More importantly, His can be directly distinguished in the absence of other toxic reagents. In addition, the amount of His in serum is also measured, suggesting the applicability of this biosensor in real sample detection. Overall, this work provides an alternative way to design G-quadruplex DNAzyme-based analytical approaches. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Fluorescent "turn-off" sensors based on double quantum dots (QDs) has attracted increasing attention in the detection of many materials due to their properties such as more useful information, higher fluorescence efficiency and stability compared with the fluorescent "turn-off" sensors based on single QDs. In this work, highly sensitive and specific method for recognition of 53 different famous green teas was developed based on the fluorescent "turn-off" model with water-soluble ZnCdSe-CdTe double QDs. The fluorescence of the two QDs can be quenched by different teas with varying degrees, which results in the differences in positions and intensities of two peaks. By the combination of classic partial least square discriminant analysis (PLSDA), all the green teas can be discriminated with high sensitivity, specificity and a satisfactory recognition rate of 100% for training set and 100% for prediction set, respectively. The fluorescent "turn-off" sensors based on the single QDs (either ZnCdSe QDs or CdTe QDs) coupled with PLSDA were also employed to recognize the 53 famous green teas with unsatisfactory results. Therefore, the fluorescent "turn-off" sensors based on the double QDs is more appropriate for the large-class-number classification (LCNC) of green teas. Herein, we have demonstrated, for the first time, that so many kinds of famous green teas can be discriminated by the "turn-off" model of double QDs combined with chemometrics, which has largely extended the capability of traditional fluorescence and chemometrics, as well as exhibits great potential to perform LCNC in other practical applications.

AB Introduced in 2000, atmospheric pressure (AP)/matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) has attracted substantial attention in the mass spectrometry community due to its ease of sample introduction and handling, interchangeability with ESI source and capability of analyzing volatile species. In this study, an AP/MALDI source with ultra-high spatial resolution was coupled to a Q Exactive HF orbitrap mass spectrometer for high resolution in situ analysis by MALDI, laserspray ionization (LSI) and matrix assisted ionization (MAI) without instrument modification. LSI and MAI generated multiply charged ions, which expanded the mass detection range and improved fragmentation efficiency. Full MS, targeted MS/MS, data dependent acquisition (DDA) and parallel reaction monitoring (PRM) acquisitions were performed on peptide and protein standards, tissue extracts and tissue sections for in depth characterization of various biomolecules. High resolution full MS and MS/MS images were obtained from crustacean and rat tissues with pixel size less than 30 mm. Overall, AP/MALDI-Q-Orbitrap is a fast scanning instrument that is capable of performing multiple types of ionization and multiple acquisition modes without instrument modification. This instrument platform provides an attractive alternative to other high resolution MALDI instruments. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This paper describes a novel rotational paper-based analytical device (RPAD) to implement multi-step electrochemiluminescence (ECL) immunoassays. The integrated paper-based rotational valves can be easily controlled by rotating paper discs manually and this advantage makes it user-friendly to untrained users to carry out the multi-step assays. In addition, the rotational valves are reusable and the response time can be shortened to several seconds, which promotes the rotational paper-based device to have great advantages in multi-step operations. Under the control of rotational valves, multi-step ECL immunoassays were conducted on the rotational device for the multiplexed detection of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and prostate specific antigen (PSA). The rotational device exhibited excellent analytical performance for CEA and PSA, and they could be detected in the linear ranges of 0.1-100 ngmL(-1) and 0.1-50 ng mL(-1) with detection limits down to 0.07 ng mL(-1) and 0.03 ng mL(-1), respectively, which were within the ranges of clinical concentrations. We hope this technique will open a new avenue for the fabrication of paper-based valves and provide potential application in clinical diagnostics. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Urinary creatinine concentration is a critical physiological parameter that enables reliable assessment of patient renal function and diagnosis of a broad spectrum of diseases. In this study, a simple and inexpensive sensor comprising monodisperse, citrate-capped silver nanoparticles (cc-AgNPs) was developed, which enabled rapid, sensitive and selective quantitation of creatinine directly in unprocessed urine. The mechanism of this sensor entails the creatinine-mediated aggregation of the cc-AgNPs (within 1 min) under alkaline conditions (pH 12). This is attributed to the tautomerization of creatinine to its amino anionic species at alkaline pH, which cross-link the cc-AgNPs via hydrogen bond networks with the negatively charged citrate caps. Creatinine elicited visibly-discernable color changes of the cc-AgNPs colloids in a concentration-dependent manner up to 10 mM. UV-visible spectroscopic analyses of the cc-AgNPs revealed that creatinine elicited a concentration-dependent decrease in intensity of the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) band centered around 403 nm, with a concomitant increase in intensity of the red-shifted LSPR band at 670 nm. This observation denotes a creatinine-mediated increase in cc-AgNP particle size via aggregation, as confirmed by transmission electron microscopy analysis. The cc-AgNP sensor exhibited a linear correlation between the A(6/0)/A(4/3) extinction ratio and creatinine concentration range of 0-4.2 mu M in aqueous solutions ( R2 = 0.996), and a low detection limit of 53.4 nM. Hence, the simplicity, short assay time, and high sensitivity and selectivity of our cc-AgNP sensor affirms its utility as a creatinine monitoring assay for low-resource, point-of-care settings.

AB This study presents the joint use of magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) and gold nanoparticles (GNPs) for double enhancement in a lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA). The study realizes two types of enhancement: (1) increasing the concentration of analytes in the samples using conjugates of MNPs with specific antibodies and (2) increasing the visibility of the label through MNP aggregation caused by GNPs. The proposed strategy was implemented using a LFIA for potato virus X (PVX), a significant potato pathogen. MNPs conjugated with biotinylated antibodies specific to PVX and GNPs conjugated with streptavidin were synthesized and characterized. The LFIAs with and without the proposed enhancements were compared. The double-enhanced LFIA achieved the highest sensitivity, equal to 0.25 ng mL(-1) and 32 times more sensitivity than the non-enhanced LFIA (detection limit: 8 ngmL(-1)). LFIAs using one of the types of amplification (magnetic concentration without GNPs-causing aggregation or MNP aggregation without the concentration stage) showed intermediate levels of sensitivity. The double-enhanced LFIA was successfully used for PVX detection in potato leaves. The results for PVX detection in the infected plants were similar for the double-enhanced LFIA developed and the conventional LFIA based on the GNP conjugates; however, the new system provided significant coloring enhancement. This study confirmed that a simple combination of MNPs and GNPs has great potential for high-sensitivity detection and could possibly be adopted for LFIAs of other compounds. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB In this work, bimetallic core-shell rhodium@palladium nanodendrites (Rh@Pd NDs) loaded on sulfo group functionalized multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs-SO3H)were combined to form Rh@Pd NDs/MWCNTs-SO3H nanocomposites. And the composites were used to construct a simple and label-free electrochemical immunosensor for carcino embryonic antigen (CEA) detection using differential pulse voltammetry (DPV). Rh@ Pd NDs with dendritic nanostructure not only provide abundant catalytically active sites, but also increase the loading of antibody, which could improve the analytical performance and result in high sensitivity. In addition, the MWCNTs-SO3H could further enhance electrochemical properties due to the excellent conductivity, good solubility and high surface area. Taking advantages of both Rh@ Pd NDs and MWCNTs-SO3H, the proposed immunosensor showed a broad linear range from 25 fg mL(-1) to 100 ngmL(-1) for CEA detection and a low detection limit of 8.3 fg mL(-1) (signal-to-noise ratio of 3) under optimal experimental conditions. Moreover, the expected immunosensor exhibited good reproducibility and high sensitivity, which could achieve excellent analysis of CEA in human serum with satisfactory results. Therefore, the Rh@Pd NDs/MWCNTs-SO3H nanocomposites may be considered as a sensing platform for fabrication of simple, ultrasensitive and label-free electrochemical immunosensor.

AB Phthalate esters PAEs) are a group of serious environmental pollutants, which lead to carcinogenicity or tumorigenicity in human body. In this study, a rapid, sensitive and green method by graphene oxide coated hollow fiber membrane extraction GO-HFME) coupled with supercritical fluid chromatography SFC) was proposed for the determination of 11 phthalate esters in bottled beverages. Graphene oxide GO) was prepared and coated onto a porous hollow fiber membrane HFM) to reinforce the efficiency of membrane extraction. The modified hollow fiber membrane was employed for the extraction of phthalate esters from bottled beverages prior to the determination by the supercritical fluid chromatography with UV detection. To achieve the maximum extraction efficiency, several parameters were investigated including GO concentration, extraction time, desorption solution and desorption time. SFC variables including stationary phase, modifier composition and percentage, column temperature, flow rate and backpressure were studied to improve the separation conditions. Under these optimized conditions, all the studied 11 phthalate esters were well separated and simultaneously determined in 7 min by SFC. The performance of the developed method was evaluated. Good linearity was observed R >= 0.999) in the range of 0.02-10.0 mu g/mL with limit of detection LOD, S/N = 3) ranging from 1.5 to 3.0 ng/mL. Recoveries of all the PAEs for the spiked samples were between 92.1% and 99.3% with satisfactory relative standard deviations RSD) less than 5.9%. The proposed method is time-saving, green, simple and robust, which will be an alternative way to the analysis of PAEs in real samples. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Tuberculosis (TB) remains one of the major infectious diseases worldwide. The pathogenic bacterium, Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tb), continuously evolves strains carrying drug-resistance genes, thus posing a growing challenge to TB prevention and treatment. We report a diagnostic system that uses a molecular beacon probe and an assistant strand as the core to simultaneously interact with an M. tbspecific fragment (in IS6110) and a single nucleotide substitution (SNS)-encoded segment (in rpoB) associated with drug resistance. A single fluorescent output in three-tiered levels was produced for combinatorial interpretations based on formation of a four-way DNA junction (4WJ). The SNS caused the 4WJ to partially dissociate, thus resulting in medium-level fluorescence. By contrast, high-and lowlevel fluorescence, represented the complete complementary complex and absence of either targeted fragments, respectively. Manipulating the length of the analyte-binding arm realized the medium output. The thermodynamics and kinetics of 4WJ construction were investigated to maximize the tieredoutput performance. Biocatalytic amplification driven by the Klenow Fragment and Nt. AlwI was incorporated into the method to enhance the signal 64-fold and ensure long-term stability of the three-tiered output. The detection accuracy of the sensing system was verified using unpurified amplicons with templates of extracted DNA and boiled bacterial solutions. The tiered-output mechanism was usable at bacterial loads ranging from 4 X 10(0) to 4 x 10(3) CFU per reaction. The interference caused by nontuberculous mycobacteria was minimal. The results demonstrated the integrity of the sensing method as an alternative strategy for rapid screening of M. tb and detecting rifampin-resistance. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A model recalibration method based on additive Partial Least Squares (PLS) regression is generalized for multi-adjustment scenarios of independent variance sources (referred to as additive PLS - aPLS). aPLS allows for effortless model readjustment under changing measurement conditions and the combination of independent variance sources with the initial model by means of additive modelling. We demonstrate these distinguishing features on two NIR spectroscopic case-studies. In case study 1 aPLS was used as a readjustment method for an emerging offset. The achieved RMS error of prediction (1.91 a.u.)was of similar level as before the offset occurred (2.11a.u.). In case-study 2 a calibration combining different variance sources was conducted. The achieved performance was of sufficient level with an absolute error being better than 0.8% of the mean concentration, therefore being able to compensate negative effects of two independent variance sources. The presented results show the applicability of the aPLS approach. The main advantages of the method are that the original model stays unadjusted and that the modelling is conducted on concrete changes in the spectra thus supporting efficient (in most cases straightforward) modelling. Additionally, the method is put into context of existing machine learning algorithms. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Cell population based toxicity assays cannot distinguish responses of single cells and sub-cellular organelles; while single cell assays are limited by low statistical power due to small number of cells examined. This article reports a new single cell array based toxicity assay, in which cell responses at population level, single cell level and sub-cellular level can be obtained simultaneously at high throughput. The single cell array was produced by microcontact printing and selected area cell attachment, and exposed to damaging X-ray radiation, which was followed by fluorescence imaging after staining. Two image processing softwares written in Python and MATLAB were used to determine the expressions of proteins associated with cell migration and invasion, and production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), respectively. The results showed significant differences in responses at single cell level and distinctive molecular heterogeneity at sub-cellular level in a large population of cells upon exposure to radiation.

AB The ever-increasing requirement of an electrochemical sensor in various paramedical and industrial applications, the recent research is motivated to fabricate a new type of electrode material with unique electrochemical properties for quantitative detection of various target analytes. Recently, the metal diselenides have been interested in a broad range of electrochemical applications due to their interesting electrocatalytic performances. Despite the metal diselenides have been widely focused on hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), it is not much focused on electrochemical sensor. For the first time, the bimetallic cobalt-iron diselenide nanosphere entrapped functionalized carbon nanofiber (CoFeSe2/f-CNF) composite have been synthesized by using simple hydrothermal synthesis and used as an electrode material for efficient electrochemical detection of caffeic acid (CA). The functionalization of CNF and the formation of CoFeSe2/f-CNF nanocomposite have been successfully scrutinized by using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, X-ray powder diffraction, transmission electron microscopy and scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. In addition, the electrochemical properties of CoFeSe2/f-CNF modified glassy carbon electrode (GCE) towards CA sensing were investigated by using cyclic voltammetry, differential pulse voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. As the result of the electrochemical studies, the developed CoFeSe2/f-CNF/GCE sensor exhibits very low detection limit (0.002 mu M) and better sensitivity (2.04 mu A mu M-1 cm(-2)) of CA. And also, CoFeSe2/f-CNF/GCE sensor shows the feasible detection of CA in red wine samples, it reveals the excellent practicability of CoFeSe2/f-CNF/GCE. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The non-invasive, quick, and safe collection of exhaled breath condensate makes it a candidate as a diagnostic matrix in personalized health monitoring devices. The lack of standardization in collection methods and sample analysis is a persistent limitation preventing its practical use. The collection method and hardware design are recognized to significantly affect the metabolomic content of EBC samples, but this has not been systematically studied.
   Here, we completed a series of experiments to determine the sole effect of collection temperature on the metabolomic content of EBC. Temperature is a likely parameter that can be controlled to standardize among different devices. The study considered six temperature levels covering two physical phases of the sample; liquid and solid. The use of a single device in our study allowed keeping saliva filtering and collector surface effects as constant parameters and the temperature as a controlled variable; the physiological differences were minimized by averaging samples from a group of volunteers and a period of time. After EBC collection, we used an organic solvent rinse to collect the non-water-soluble compounds from the condenser surface. This additional matrix enhanced metabolites recovery, was less dependent on temperature changes, and may possibly serve as an additional pointer to standardize EBC sampling methodologies. The collected EBC samples were analyzed with a set of mass spectrometry methods to provide an overview of the compounds and their concentrations present at each temperature level.
   The total number of volatile and polar non-volatile compounds slightly increased in each physical phase as the collection temperature was lowered to minimum, 0 degrees C for liquid and -30, -56 degrees C for solid. The low-polarity non-volatile compounds showed a weak dependence on the collection temperature. The metabolomic content of EBC samples may not be solely dependent on temperature but may be influenced by other phenomena such as greater sample dilution due to condensation from the ambient air at colder temperatures, or due to adhesion properties of the collector surface and occurring chemical reactions. The relative importance of other design parameters such as condenser coating versus temperature requires further investigation. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Although great progress has been made on designing noble metal nanoparticle aggregates/assemblies as surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) substrates, an ever increasing research interest has focused on fabrication of hierarchical nanostructures for superior SERS performance. Here, we report effective decoration of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) onto vertically and densely grown alpha-Fe2O3 nanoflakes (NFs) as SERS active substrates. The SERS substrate was prepared by thermally annealing Fe foil at 450 degrees C to grow alpha-Fe2O3 NFs and electroless deposition of AgNPs onto alpha-Fe2O3 NFs, with excellent ability to control the particle size and density. The AgNP-decorated alpha-Fe2O3 NFs offer high density hot spots and exhibited high SERS performance with enhancement factor of 8.1 x 10(6). Integration of alpha-Fe2O3 nanostructure functions as intrinsic internal standard and selective binder for specific analytes like the toxic arsenic. The substrate was successfully used for quantitative detection of arsenic with spatial uniformity (relative standard deviation, RSD, 8.8%) and good reproducibility (RSD, 9.7%). The Raman signal of alpha-Fe2O3 integrated to the SERS substrate was utilized as internal standard which significantly improves reproducibility. The substrate exhibited a high sensitivity for arsenic detection with a limit of detection down to 1.5 mu g L-1, which is much lower than permissible limit (10 mu g L-1) set by the WHO. Moreover, the SERS substrates showed excellent practicability and selectivity for determination of arsenic in environmental waters which is valuable for environmental and human health protection.

AB Over the past few decades, assays of biothiols had attracted much attention due to the essential role they played in human physiology, especially using the fluorescent analysis. In most cases, competitive mechanism was often employed, where the metal ions were often introduced as the quenchers and thiols competed with metal ions due to the high binding affinity and strong thiophilicity for 'signal-on' assays. To develop a metal ions-free approach for the assays of thiols, here, L-tyrosine methyl ester capped carbon dots (Tyr-CDs) were employed and prepared as the fluorescent probes. The as-prepared Tyr-CDs displayed narrow size distribution and distinct blue fluorescence with high quantum yield (12.9%) compared with the unmodified CDs. Moreover, Tyr-CDs exhibited higher quenching efficiency due to the efficient energy transfer between Tyr-CDs and the quinone products in the presence of tyrosinase. When the targeted biothiols was present, the catalytic reaction of the tyrosinase to the formation of quinone was inhibited and the fluorescence signal was recovered in a biothiols-concentration-dependent manner, which provided the basis for the analysis of biothiols. The practical application of the present system was demonstrated by testing the biothiols in human plasma samples and good recovery was obtained, indicating that the sensing platform we proposed hold great promise in the accurate detection of biothiols in complex biosystems.

AB In the present study, the immobilization method of physical adsorption combined with covalent crosslinking was developed to avoid the shortcomings of both the noncovalent and covalent coupling methods. For the first time, tyrosinase (TYR) was immobilized on the surface of aminated magnetic nanoparticles (Fe3O4-NH2) by the developed method. TYR was firstly adsorbed on the surface of Fe3O4-NH2 by electrostatic interaction, and then by covalent crosslinking with glutaraldehyde (GA), TYR was firmly immobilized on the supports. The immobilized TYR showed enhanced pH and temperature endurances at the optimum pH of 7.0 and temperature of 35 degrees C. TYR reusability was significantly improved after immobilization and it retained 61.4 +/- 2.3% of its initial activity after 5 repeated cycles. Immobilized TYR also showed improved storage stability (73.2 +/- 1.1% after 30 days of storage at 4 degrees C). In addition, the immobilized TYR showed a higher biological affinity to substrate owing to the stabilization of TYR in its active conformation by electrostatic interaction prior to covalent crosslinking. Finally, the immobilized TYR was used to screen of enzyme inhibitors from 11 traditional Chinese medicines (TCMs) to validate whether this method can be used for enzyme inhibitor screening or not.

AB In this paper, we introduce a novel approach for the detection of electroactive analytes by using oxidant species accumulated in pseudocapacitors surface. We demonstrated that pseudocapacitors can be quickly discharged when in contact with electroactive species. Thus, the variation of potential can be monitored during the discharging process and correlated with the analyte concentration. Based on this, two electroanalytical methods were proposed: continuous discharging detection and pulsed discharging detection. As a proof of concept, these methods were employed for glucose, fructose and sucrose detection using an ion chromatograph containing an electrochemical detector. Copper vertical bar cupric oxide in alkaline medium was used as the pseudocapacitive system. The obtained results proved to be very promising and the analytical curves showed good linearity in both methods. In addition, this novel approach for the detection of saccharides based on potential variation as a result of the discharging of the pseudocapacitor in contact with the analyte is very attractive because it does not require current reading. Therefore, our approach can be applied to other pseudocapacitive systems, opening new possibilities for several electroanalytical applications. (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

   TUTORIAL
AB The reliability of chemical processes can be greatly improved by implementing inline monitoring systems. Combining multivariate analysis with non-destructive sensors can enhance the process without interfering with the operation. We present here hierarchical models using both principal component analysis and partial least square analysis developed for different chemical components representative of solvent extraction process streams. A training set of 380 samples and an external validation set of 95 samples were prepared and Near infrared and Raman spectral data as well as conductivity under variable temperature conditions were collected. The results from the models indicate that careful selection of the spectral range is important. By compressing the data through Principal Component Analysis (PCA), we lower the rank of the data set to its most dominant features while maintaining the key principal components to be used in the regression analysis. Within the studied data set, concentration of five chemical components were modeled; total nitrate (NO3-), total acid (H+), neodymium (Nd3+), sodium (Na+), and ionic strength (I.S.). The best overall model prediction for each of the species studied used a combined data set comprised of complementary techniques including NIR, Raman, and conductivity. Our study shows that chemometric models are powerful but requires significant amount of carefully analyzed data to capture variations in the chemistry. (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A fully automated analytical platform that seamlessly integrates online water sampling-sample preparation-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) was developed for ultraviolet (UV) filters in this work. The online water sampling system consisted of a conventional sample vial (slightly modified to have both inlet and outlet ports), two tubings and a peristaltic pump, which controlled the water flow into and out of the vial. The sample preparation segment consists of miniscale liquid-liquid extraction (msLLE), coupled to full evaporation dynamic headspace concentration (FEDHS) on a commercial dual-arm autosampler. The extract from the msLLE step was subjected to a derivatization step, before being passed through a Tenax TA sorbent tube at the FEDHS stage. UV filters were used as model compounds in this work due to their potential endocrine and developmental toxicities, including benzhydrol, 2-ethylhexyl salicylate, homosalate, 2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzophenone, 3-(4'-methylbenzylidene) camphor and benzophenone. The analytes (of which the first four underwent derivatization, by virtue of them possessing hydroxyl groups, but not the last two) were concentrated on the sorbent, and were thermally desorbed before being introduced to the GC-MS system for analysis. An orthogonal array design (OAD) strategy was employed to facilitate the optimization of the msLLE and derivatization factors while univariate optimization was performed for FEDHS. The optimized settings achieved low limits of detection (0.6-9.7 ng L-1) with good linearity (r(2) >= 0.9926), and satisfactory absolute extraction recoveries (62.0%-80.7%) were obtained. The fully automated online water sampling-extraction/concentration-detection approach was demonstrated by applying it to the analysis of swimming pool water. Relative recoveries of the analytes in the pool water ranged from 85.4% to 118.2%. The described procedure has the potential to be a fully automated online water sampling-msLLE-FEDHS-GC-MS platform for the purpose of conducting routine onsite water analysis. (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB Simplification and miniaturization in analytical procedures are highly preferred by analysts and other researchers. In this study, a low-cost, convenient and efficient liquid-phase microextraction method, termed ballpoint tip-protected liquid-phase microextraction (BT-LPME), was established. The bullet-shaped BT possessed a hollow cavity of several microliters for solvent storage and an opening tail for solute extraction. Magnetic field-induced BT spinning significantly accelerated the extraction process. By virtue of the adhesion between a stainless steel sheath and an organic solvent, along with cave protection, finely stable storage of extractant was achieved even under high spinning speeds (>1000 rpm). The BT-LPME performance was evaluated by extracting five polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) from aqueous solution, followed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GCMS) analysis. Compared to static single drop microextraction (SDME), the BT-LPME method provided higher enrichments (128-173-fold) for the five PAHs. Good linearities (from 0.01 similar to 0.05 mu g L-1 to 50 mu g L-1) with a regression coefficient (r(2)) >= 0.9993, as well as low limits of detection (LODs, 0.002-0.011 mu g L-1) and limits of quantification (LOQs, 0.007-0.023 mu g L-1), were obtained. Relative recoveries varied from 92.3% to 103.4% at three spiked levels of 0.1, 1 and 10 mu g L-1. The BT-LPME technique was also successfully applied to the enrichment of other organic compounds, such as organophosphorus compounds, organochlorines and triazines. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB Since the first detection of synthetic cannabinoids (SCs) in so-called 'legal high' products (e.g. 'Spice') sold as legal alternatives to marihuana, the rapid development of this class of designer drugs poses a great challenge for analytical laboratories. The aim of this study was the comprehensive validation of an up-to-date LC-MS/MS method for detection of SCs in human hair for the purpose of drug abstinence testing and evaluation of a pragmatic re-validation approach for frequent method adaption. The validation demonstrated low quantification limits (0.5-5.0 pg mg(-1)) and acceptable selectivity, linearity, accuracy, and precision for 72 SCs. High matrix effects have been taken into consideration as a major limitation of the method. The partial re-validation approach proved to be an appropriate compromise between reduced validation effort and sufficient control of the method performance enabling analysts to keep pace with the dynamics of the drug market. The analysis of 294 authentic samples resulted in 163 positive samples and showed a broad concentration range (<1.0-5,700 pg mg(-1)) for 52 SCs in hair with up to 17 different compounds detected in a single hair sample. Periods of detection between one and 58 months were observed for single compounds in hair. Regarding the interpretation of analytical findings semi-quantitative concentrations were considered sufficient for a rough classification of the intensity of drug exposure in (i) passive exposure or exposure in the distant past (lower pg mg(-1) range), (ii) more intense exposure (elevated concentration range, >20 pg mg(-1) (upper 25th-percentile)), and (iii) heavy/recent exposure (>150 pg mg(-1)).

   INTRODUCTION SYSTEM
AB Comprehensive investigation of chemical generation of volatile species (VSG) of palladium for detection by analytical atomic and mass spectrometry and, specifically, the mechanistic aspects of their formation and tentative identification are presented. VSG was achieved in a flow injection mode using a generator that permitted rapid mixing of acidified sample with NaBH4 reductant. Atomization in a diffusion flame with detection by atomic absorption spectrometry was exclusively used for optimization of generation conditions while inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry was utilized to investigate overall system efficiency and analytical metrics of the VSG system for potential ultratrace analysis. Sodium diethyldithiocarbamate (DDTC) served as a crucial reaction modifier, enhancing overall system efficiency 9-fold. Combinations of modifiers, Triton X-100 and Antifoam B surfactants provided a synergistic effect to yield a further 2-fold enhancement of VSG. The overall system efficiency was in the range 16-22%, with higher efficiencies correlating with higher Pd concentrations. The contribution of co-generated aerosol to the overall system efficiency, determined by means of concurrent measurement of added Cs, was negligible - less than 0.1%. The nature of the volatile species was investigated using several approaches, but principally by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) after their collection on a grid, and by direct analysis in real time (DART) using high resolution orbitrap mass spectrometry. These experiments suggest a parallel but dual-route mechanism of VSG of Pd, one attributed to generation of a volatile DDTC chelate of Pd and a second to nanoparticle formation.

AB Manual handling of microliter volumes of samples and reagents is usually prone to errors and may have direct consequence on the overall performance of microextraction process. Direct connection of a syringe pump and a disposable microextraction unit using flexible polymeric tubing was employed for semi-automated liquid handling in micro-electromembrane extraction (mu-EME). A three-phase mu-EME system was formed by consecutive withdrawal of microliter volumes of donor solution, free liquid membrane (FLM) and acceptor solution into the unit. Excellent repeatability and accuracy of the withdrawal sequence was achieved for solution volumes typically used in mu-EME (1-5 mu L) as well as excellent correlation between the initially withdrawn and the finally collected solution volumes. mu-EMEs were initiated by application of d.c. electric potential to the terminal aqueous solutions and specific mu-EME parameters were optimized in order to ensure complete transfer of model analytes from donor to acceptor solution. Exhaustive mu-EMEs of three basic drugs, nortriptyline, papaverine and haloperidol, were achieved from 1.3 mu L of acidified donor solution (10 mM HCl) across 2.5 mu L of FLM (1-ethyl-2-nitrobenzene) into 1.3 mL of acidified acceptor solution (25mM HCl) in 10 min at 150 V. The three drugs were also exhaustively extracted from salt-and protein-containing standard solutions, human urine and human plasma with extraction recoveries ranging from 79 to 102%. Resulting acceptor solutions were analysed by capillary electrophoresis with ultraviolet detection (CE-UV) and the mu-EME-CE-UV method was characterized by good linearity (coefficients of determination > 0.992), high repeatability (RSD values <= 6.5%) and limits of detection <= 0.15 mg/L.

AB Surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) is a promising and emerging technique to analyze the cellular environment. We developed an alternative, rapid and label-free SERS-based method to get information about the cellular environment by analyzing cells lysates, thus avoiding the need to incorporate nanoparticles into cells. Upon sonicating and filtrating cells, we obtained lysates which, mixed with Au or Ag nanoparticles, yield stable and repeatable SERS spectra, whose overall profile depends on the metal used as substrate, but not on the buffer used for the lysis process. Bands appearing in these spectra were shown to arise mostly from the cytosol and were assigned to adenine, guanine, adenosine and reduced glutathione (GSH). Spectral differences among various cell types also demonstrated that this approach is suitable for cell type identification. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Extracellular vesicles (EVs) have been recognized as messengers delivering various active molecules between cells. This feature of EVs drew the attention of clinicians as well as researchers from different fields. However, exciting ideas to employ EVs as means of drug delivery or to test them as biomarkers of cellular status require very thoughtful and attentive approaches to the selection of analytical techniques for EV characterization. Optical and surface plasmonic analytical methods offer a researcher an invaluable opportunity to use already sized and/or quantified EVs in further functional cell-based assays and in focused biochemical tests (nucleic acid and protein arrays, etc.). Moreover, a high sensitivity and relative flexibility of surface plasmonic sensors open a possibility to develop instruments performing quantitative, metrical and EV surface/content analysis in a single device. This review aims to consider the applicability of established and modern optical techniques as well as novel surface plasmonic approaches for different aspects of EV analysis. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB We propose a method for regulating biomolecules immobilization performance of metal-organic coordination polymers (MOCPs) through pre-coordination for highly sensitive biosensing. 2,5-dimercapto-1,3,4-thiadiazole (DMcT) was used as organic monomers. Firstly, using CuCl2 as the source of metal ions to form short oligomers with DMcT (MOCPs(Cu)), which can regulate the length of ligands through precoordination. Then exploiting NaAuCl4 as the source of Au ions to coordinate both short oligomers and biomolecules (MOCPs(C+Au)), since Au ions can coordinate with both N and S atoms. Through controlling the concentration of CuCl2, oligomers with desired length could be readily obtained to prepare MOCPs(Cu+Au) framework with controllable porosity and enzyme entrapment efficiency. Thus MOCPs(Cu+Au) offers several advantages including improved mass transfer efficiency and biocatalytic sensitivity than conventional MOCPs using single metal ions. Glucose oxidase (GOx) was used as the representative biomolecule, the entrapment ratio of enzyme in MOCPs(Cu+Au) case reached an extreme value of 100%. These MOCPs(Cu+Au) biocomposites modified electrode also showed greatly enhanced biocatalytic sensitivity (127 mu A cm(-2) mM(-1)) and very low detection limit (58 nM), compared with those reported analogues. The new materials/strategy may create new avenue to regulate the performance of ligandconstructed polymers and their composites for entrapment-based applications. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Neurotransmitters are signaling molecules which play a key role in the central nervous system allowing signal transmission in the neuronal synapses. The role of these compounds is very crucial in the biological systems. A rapid, sensitive, economical and derivatisation free method has been developed for the analysis of 15 neurotransmitters in a single run on liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. These 15 neurotransmitters are categorized into 5 groups on the basis of their fragmentation pattern. The proposed method "ionic liquid based ultrasound assisted dispersive liquid-liquid microextraction" hyphenated with tandem mass spectrometry is the first report for the analysis of neurotransmitters in cell samples along with other two matrices (rat brain and plasma). All the parameters that influence the extraction efficiency are optimized with aid of response surface methodology and desirability profile. Under these optimized conditions the developed method has been validated. The limit of detection was in the range of (1) 0.021-0.912 mu g L-1 for rat brain samples, (2) 0.028-0.978 mu g L-1 for plasma samples and (3) 0.025-0.945 mu g L-1 for cell samples with good linearity behavior for all analytes in the concentration range of 0.04-200 mu g L-1 in all the three matrices. The coefficient of determination for all the neurotransmitters was found in the range of (1) (R-2) >= 0.996 to 0.999 for rat brain samples and (2) (R-2) > 0.991 to 0.999 for plasma and cell samples. The intra-day and inter-day variations were found less than (1) 1.78% and 8.94% for rat brain samples, (2) 1.83% and 8.37% for plasma samples and (3) 1.64% and 8.04% for cell samples respectively. The method has mean recoveries varied between (1) 81-128% for brain samples, (2) 88-107% for plasma samples and (3) 91-104% for cell samples at different spiking levels. The optimized and validated method was found free from matrix interferences and successfully applied for quantitative determination of 15 neurotransmitters in the rat brain, plasma and cell samples.

AB Sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) removal is a vital procedure in SDS-assisted bottom-up proteomics because SDS affects the quality of the data in electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS). SDS removal methods provide efficient removal of SDS and improved peptide analysis, but would usually require time, specialised devices, and experienced analysts. Here, by simple addition of gamma-cyclodextrin (gamma-CD) to the solution at concentrations 1 to 2x the SDS in the sample, the SDS related signals in positive ionization ESI-MS can be significantly removed (70-99% reduction), without an additional sample manipulation step of extraction or purification. The mechanism for removal is based on the formation of tightly bound CD-SDS inclusion complexes, which hampered the generation of positively charged SDS multimers during ESI. For a sample with peptides (glu-val-phe, tyr-tyr-tyr, and bradykinin) and 3mM SDS where 6mM gamma-CD was added, the % signal recoveries of peptides calculated by comparison with signals from standard samples without SDS were 49-59%. The space charge effect by SDS on bradykinin was also reduced, increasing the signal for bradykinin 12x in the presence of gamma-CD. For a protein (bovine serum albumin, BSA) digest with 3mM SDS, which is an expected concentration in trypsin treated samples, a noticeable 7-fold improvement in the peptide to SDS signal ratio and a 91% reduction of SDS signals were observed upon addition of 6mM gamma-CD. However, there were only small changes in the ESI-MS intensities for the BSA peptides (compared to without addition of gamma-CD). This new approach to SDS signal removal using CDs in ESI-MS may find use in proteomic studies. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB With its low-cost fabrication and ease of modification, paper-based analytical devices have developed rapidly in recent years. Microarrays allow automatic analysis of multiple samples or multiple reactions with minimal sample consumption. While cellulose paper is generally used, its high backgrounds in spectrometry outside of the visible range has limited its application to be mostly colorimetric analysis. In this work, glass-microfiber paper is used as the substrate for a microarray. The glass-microfiber is essentially chemically inert SiOx, and the lower background from this inorganic microfiber can avoid interference from organic analytes in various spectrometers. However, generally used wax printing fails to wet glass microfibers to form hydrophobic barriers. Therefore, to prepare the hydrophobic-hydrophilic pattern, the glass-microfiber paper was first modified with an octadecyltrichlorosilane (OTS) self-assembled monolayer (SAM) to make the paper hydrophobic. A hydrophilic microarray was then prepared using a CO2 laser scriber that selectively removed the OTS layer with a designed pattern. One microliter of aqueous drops of peptides at various concentrations were then dispensed inside the round patterns where OTS SAM was removed while the surrounding area with OTS layer served as a barrier to separate each drop. The resulting specimen of multiple spots was automatically analyzed with a time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometer (ToF-SIMS), and all of the secondary ions were collected. Among the various cluster ions that have developed over the past decade, pulsed C-60(+) was selected as the primary ion because of its high secondary ion intensity in the high mass region, its minimal alteration of the surface when operating within the static-limit and spatial resolution at the similar to mu m level. In the resulting spectra, parent ions of various peptides (in the forms [M+H](+) and [M+Na](+)) were readily identified for parallel detection of molecules in a mixture. By normalizing the ion intensity of peptides with respect to the glass-microfiber matrix ([SiOH](+)), a linear calibration curve for each peptide was generated to quantify these components in a mixture.

AB We have described a continuous flow ATR-FTIR method for measuring some of the Butyrylcholinesterase enzyme kinetics (K-m and V-max). This is done by developing a circulating system to be close as much as possible to the human circulation using human serum as a source of the enzyme with adjusted pH, isotonicity and temperature to give the maximum affinity of the enzyme towards its substrate (bambuterol).
   The experiment was running continuously for 90 min to monitor the production of terbutaline from the zero time of its appearance with a measured spectrum in each minute using ZnSe prism. The method was selective and successful for determination of V-max to be 8.16 x 10(-8) mol/min/ml and K-m to be 2.28 x 10(-5) mol, showing high affinity of the enzyme towards its prodrug substrate Bambuterol.
   This study critically probes the quantitative ability of the ATR-FTIR method for terbutaline, which was validated according to ICH guidelines showing high accuracy 100.39% and high selectivity towards the produced terbutaline, as the produced spectrums considered as fingerprint of each compound.

AB A new polymer flow-cell for chemiluminescence detection (CLD) has been designed and developed by diverging multiple linear channels from a common centre port in a radial arrangement. The fabrication of radial flow-cell by 3D PolyJet printing and fused deposition modeling (FDM) has been evaluated, and compared with a similarly prepared spiral flow-cell design commonly used in chemiluminescence detectors. The radial flow-cell required only 10 h of post-PolyJet print processing time as compared to ca. 360 h long post-PolyJet print processing time required for the spiral flow-cell. Using flow injection analysis, the PolyJet 3D printed radial flow-cell provided an increase in both the signal magnitude and duration, with an average increase in the peak height of 63% and 58%, peak area of 89% and 90%, and peak base width of 41% and 42%, as compared to a coiled-tubing spiral flow-cell and the PolyJet 3D printed spiral flow-cell, respectively. Computational fluid dynamic (CFD) simulations were applied to understand the origin of the higher CLD signal obtained with the radial flow-cell design, indicating higher spatial coverage near the inlet and lower linear velocities in the radial flow-cell. The developed PolyJet 3D printed radial flow-cell was applied in a new ion chromatography chemiluminescence based assay for the detection of H2O2 in urine and coffee extracts. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB Herein, a highly-sensitive microRNA (miRNA) detection strategy was developed by combining bio-barcode assay (BBA) with catalytic hairpin assembly (CHA). In the proposed system, two nanoprobes of magnetic nanoparticles functionalized with DNA probes (MNPs-DNA) and gold nanoparticles with numerous barcode DNA (AuNPs-DNA) were designed. In the presence of target miRNA, the MNP-DNA and AuNP-DNA hybridized with target miRNA to form a "sandwich" structure. After "sandwich" structures were separated from the solution by the magnetic field and dehybridized by high temperature, the barcode DNA sequences were released by dissolving AuNPs. The released barcode DNA sequences triggered the toehold strand displacement assembly of two hairpin probes, leading to recycle of barcode DNA sequences and producing numerous fluorescent CHA products for miRNA detection. Under the optimal experimental conditions, the proposed two-stage amplification system could sensitively detect target miRNA ranging from 10 pM to 10 aM with a limit of detection (LOD) down to 97.9 zM. It displayed good capability to discriminate single base and three bases mismatch due to the unique sandwich structure. Notably, it presented good feasibility for selective multiplexed detection of various combinations of synthetic miRNA sequences and miRNAs extracted from different cell lysates, which were in agreement with the traditional polymerase chain reaction analysis. The two-stage amplification strategy may be significant implication in the biological detection and clinical diagnosis. (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A systematic electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analysis at different potentials of an in situ-prepared bismuth-film glassy carbon electrode (BiFE) in 0.1M acetate buffer solution is reported. This electrode is employed in the square-wave anodic stripping voltammetry (SWASV) technique for the determination of trace amounts of the heavy metals Zn, Cd, and Pb. The method was first validated for detection limit, linear range, sensitivity, precision and accuracy to clearly prove the superior action of BiFE compared with the bare glassy carbon electrode (GCE). Next, in order to investigate the characteristics of this sensor, EIS measurements were carried out at slightly more negative potentials than the potentials at which each individual stripping signal is detected, after the deposition step at different deposition potentials. For comparison, EIS measurements were also performed at open circuit potential. The studied trace metal concentration range (5-20 ppb) did not significantly influence the capacitive and resistive behaviour of the BiFE which explains why the performance of this sensor is superior compared with the bare GCE. The higher sensitivity of the SWASV method for BiFE compared with the bare GCE was explained by the lower polarisation resistance values of the former. Moreover, the potential of zero charge was also determined, and an explanation whether the system is under kinetic-and/or diffusion-controlled process is given. (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB This paper describes the optimization and validation of an acetonitrile based method for simultaneous extraction of multiple pesticides and mycotoxins from raw coffee beans followed by LC-ESI-MS/MS determination. Before extraction, the raw coffee samples were milled and then slurried with water. The slurried samples were spiked with two separate standard solutions, one containing 131 pesticides and a second with 35 mycotoxins, which were divided into 3 groups of different relative concentration levels. Optimization of the QuEChERS approach included performance tests with acetonitrile acidified with acetic acid or formic acid, with or without buffer and with or without clean-up of the extracts before LC-ESI-MS/MS analysis. For the clean-up step, seven d-SPE sorbents and their various mixtures were evaluated. After method optimization a complete validation study was carried out to ensure adequate performance of the extraction and chromatographic methods. The samples were spiked at 3 concentrations levels with both mycotoxins and pesticides (with 6 replicates at each level, n = 6) and then submitted to the extraction procedure. Before LC-ESI-MS/ MS analysis, the acetonitrile extracts were diluted 2-fold with methanol, in order to improve the chromatographic performance of the early-eluting polar analytes. Calibration standard solutions were prepared in organic solvent and in blank coffee extract at 7 concentration levels and analyzed 6 times each. The method was assessed for accuracy (recovery %), precision (RSD%), selectivity, linearity (r(2)), limit of quantification (LOQ) and matrix effects (%). (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Detection of native proteins, particularly directly from raw biological samples, has been a challenging task for mass spectrometry. In this study, we demonstrated that solid-substrate electrospray ionization mass spectrometry with nonpolar solvents such as n-hexane could allow detection of native proteins and protein complexes directly from raw biological samples. Mechanistic study revealed that the process involved rapid vaporization of the nonpolar solvent, temperature reduction of substrate surface, condensation of water from the ambient air, and spray ionization of the condensed water with analytes under the electric field. The fine spray with water at low temperature allowed the technique to detect native proteins, even directly from viscous samples (e.g., egg white) and solid samples (e.g., bone marrow). This study sheds new insight into the sampling and ionization process of mass spectrometry and provides a technique of great potential for characterization of proteins. (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB Conjugation of poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) to protein drugs (PEGylation) is increasingly utilized in the biotherapeutics field because it improves significantly the drugs' circulatory half-life, solubility, and shelf-life. The activity of a PEGylated drug depends on the number, size, and location of the attached PEG chain(s). This study introduces a 2D separation approach, including reversed-phase ultra-performance liquid chromatography (RP-UPLC) and ion mobility mass spectrometry (IM-MS), in order to determine the structural properties of the conjugates, as demonstrated for a PEGylated insulin sample that was prepared by random amine PEGylation. The UPLC dimension allowed separation based on polarity. Electrospray ionization (ESI) of the eluates followed by in-source dissociation (ISD) truncated the PEG chains and created insulin fragments that provided site-specific information based on whether they contained a marker at the potential conjugation sites. Separation of the latter fragments by size and charge in the orthogonal IM dimension (pseudo-4D UPLC-ISD-IM-MS approach) enabled clear detection and identification of the positional isomers formed upon PEGylation. The results showed a highly heterogeneous mixture of singly and multiply conjugated isomers plus unconjugated material. PEGylation was observed on all three possible attachment sites (epsilon-NH2 of LysB29, A-and B-chain N-termini). Each PEGylation site was validated by analysis of the same product after disulfide bond cleavage, so that the PEGylated A-and B-chain could be individually characterized with the same pseudo-4D UPLC-ISD-IM-MS method.

AB Antimony (Sb) is a toxic element which causes different health problems including cardiac problems and lung cancer in humans, and its levels in surface water can be noticeably increased to 100 mg/L typically in the proximity of anthropogenic sources. Thus, besides instrumental techniques, it is of great significance to develop a simple, sensitive and selective analytical method for direct analysis of Sb(III) at trace level without the need of any expensive and/or complicated instrumentations and sample preparation processes. Herein, a simple and sensitive headspace colorimetric assay was developed for the detection of Sb(III) by hydride generation coupled with thioglycolic acid functionalized gold nanoparticles (TGA-AuNPs). Sb(III) in the 30 mL sample solution was converted into its volatile form (SbH3) through hydride generation reaction and headspace extracted into 100 mL chromogenic reagent, which contains methanol as extractant and TGA-AuNPs as nanosensors, leading to aggregation of TGA-AuNPs and therefore a red-to-blue color change. Parameters influencing the chromogenic and hydride generation reactions were optimized. Addition of 300 mu M ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA) as masking agent largely suppressed the inferences from mercury and arsenic. The proposed method can tolerate at least 10-fold As(III) and 100-fold other metal ions including Hg(II). The detection limits were 6.0 and 1.2 mu g/L Sb(III) by naked-eye and UV-Vis spectrometer, respectively, which meet the maximum admissible level in drinking water (6 mu g/L) set by the United States Environmental Protection Agency. The feasibility of the proposed method was demonstrated by rapid detection of Sb(III) in river water, lake water, ground water and sea water samples by naked-eye at a spiking level of 6 mg/L Sb(III).

AB Nanozymes have been extensively exploited in the construction of colorimetric sensors in the past decade. However, as lack of specific recognition element, these sensors are mostly limited in the detection of hydrogen peroxide and its related agents. In this work, a colorimetric assay for the detection of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity was developed by employing copper (II)-based metal-organic frameworks (Cu-MOFs) as peroxidase mimic and pyrophosphate (PPi) as recognition element. Benefiting from its intrinsic porosity, Cu-MOFs built from one-step self-assembly showed a superior catalytic activity over horseradish peroxidase. It was found that, in the presence of PPi, the catalytic activity of Cu-MOFs was greatly inhibited due to the ultrastrong binding ability of Cu2thorn with PPi, and no colorimetric signal was recorded. However, after incubation with ALP, such negative behavior of PPi can be suppressed as the hydrolysis of PPi into orthophosphates (Pi) with low affinity to Cu2thorn, producing a colorimetric signal depending on ALP level. On this basis, a way for quantitative analysis of ALP activity was paved accordingly. Compared with previously reported ALP assays based on nanomaterials, this assay is simple, cost-effective and visualized, which not only allows highly sensitive analysis of ALP activity with a detection limit of 0.19 U/L, but also exhibits a good sensing performance in serum samples. Furthermore, based on the distinct colorimetric signals induced by PPi and ALP, an IMPLICATION logic gate was constructed. We hope that this study could provide a new insight for designing nanozyme-based highly specific colorimetric sensors. (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this work, for the first time, manganese (IV) oxide-modified screen-printed graphene electrodes (MnO2/SPGEs) were developed for the simultaneous electrochemical detection of coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) and a-lipoic acid (ALA). This sensor exhibits attractive benefits such as simplicity, low production costs, and disposability. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was used to characterize the electrochemical behavior of the analyte and investigate the capacitance and electroactive surface area of the unmodified and modified electrode surfaces. The electrochemical behavior of CoQ10 and ALA on MnO2/SPGEs was also discussed. Additionally, square wave anodic stripping voltammetry (SWASV) was used for the quantitative determination of CoQ10 and ALA. Under optimal conditions, the obtained signals are linear in the concentration range from 2.0 to 75.0 mu gmL(-1) for CoQ10 and 0.3-25.0 mu gmL(-1) for ALA. The low limits of detection (LODs) were found to be 0.56 mu gmL(-1) and 0.088 mu gmL(-1) for CoQ10 and ALA, respectively. Moreover, we demonstrated the utility and applicability of the MnO2/SPGE sensor through simultaneous measurements of CoQ10 and ALA in dietary supplements. The sensor provides high accuracy measurements, exhibiting its high potential for practical applications. (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In-process sampling and analysis is an important aspect of monitoring kinetic profiles and impurity formation or rejection, both in development and during commercial manufacturing. In pharmaceutical process development, the technology of choice for a substantial portion of this analysis is high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Traditionally, the sample extraction and preparation for reaction characterization have been performed manually. This can be time consuming, laborious, and impractical for long processes. Depending on the complexity of the sample preparation, there can be variability introduced by different analysts, and in some cases, the integrity of the sample can be compromised during handling. While there are commercial instruments available for on-line monitoring with HPLC, they lack capabilities in many key areas. Some do not provide integration of the sampling and analysis, while others afford limited flexibility in sample preparation. The current offerings provide a limited number of unit operations available for sample processing and no option for workflow customizability. This work describes development of a microfluidic automated program (MAP) which fully automates the sample extraction, manipulation, and on-line LC analysis. The flexible system is controlled using an intuitive Microsoft Excel based user interface. The autonomous system is capable of unattended reaction monitoring that allows flexible unit operations and workflow customization to enable complex operations and on-line sample preparation. The automated system is shown to offer advantages over manual approaches in key areas while providing consistent and reproducible in-process data. (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this paper, kelp (Laminaria japonica), as a kind of abundant biomass, is used as the precursor for the preparation of kelp-derived hierarchical meso-macroporous carbons (K-dHMMCs) through the carbonization under nitrogen (N-2) atmosphere at high temperature. The K-dHMMCs exhibits the unique structure with high specific surface area of 416.02m(2) g(-1), large pore volume of 0.24 cm(3) g(-1), the hierarchical meso-macroporous size distribution centered at 2, 12 and 82 nm and high density of defective sites, enabling K-dHMMCs attractive for the electrocatalysis. Drop-casting K-dHMMCs on the glassy carbon (GC) surface allows the construction of K-dHMMCs based electrochemical sensing platform, which shows electrocatalytic activities towards many electroactive molecules, such as potassium ferricyanide, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), dopamine (DA), uric acid (UA), ascorbic acid (AA), epinephrine (EP), L-tyrosine (Tyr) and acetaminophen (APAP). Especially, the KdHMMCs modified GC (K-dHMMCs/GC) electrode exhibits higher sensitivity, wider linear range, and lower detection limit than both carbon nanotubes modified GC (CNTs/GC) and GC electrodes for H2O2 detection, which makes the K-dHMMCs/GC electrode to be able to determine the H2O2 levels in human urine sample and monitor the H2O2 released from human cancer cells. These results demonstrate that KdHMMCs/GC possesses a great potential for conventional electrochemical sensing applications. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The fractionation of phosphorus in 9 soils was established according to the standards, measurements and testing (SMT) programme. Five fractions were so defined and phosphorus was analysed by spectrophotometry. In parallel, the phosphorus extracted in each fraction was determined using graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometry (GFAAS) after validation of this technique using certified reference materials. Phosphorus in soils was named total phosphorus, inorganic and organic phosphorus, apatite and non-apatite inorganic phosphorus, depending on extractants. The use of both analytical techniques revealed differences between the concentration of phosphorus in soluble extracts and highlighted the fact that spectrophotometry was a selective analytical technique. In view of the resourceand time-consuming of the SMT procedure and the results obtained in the present study, an alternative method was proposed to estimate the fractionation of phosphorus in soil in order to precise the potential effects of phosphorus on plant nutrition when plant biomass is produced as part of metal-contaminated soil management.

AB A graphene oxide (GO) nanosheet-modified Nthorn-nylon membrane (GOM) has been prepared and used as an extraction and spray-ionization substrate for robust mass spectrometric detection of malachite green (MG), a highly toxic disinfectant in liquid samples and fish meat. The GOM is prepared by self-deposition of GO thin film onto an Nthorn-nylon membrane, which has been used for efficient extraction of MG in aquaculture water samples or homogenized fish meat samples. Having a dissociation constant of 2.17 x 10 x 9M(-1), the GOM allows extraction of approximately 98% of 100 nMMG. Coupling of the GOMspray with an ion-trap mass spectrometer allows quantitation of MG in aquaculture freshwater and seawater samples down to nanomolar levels. Furthermore, the system possesses high selectivity and sensitivity for the quantitation of MG and its metabolite (leucomalachite green) in fish meat samples. With easy extraction and efficient spray ionization properties of GOM, this membrane spray-mass spectrometry technique is relatively simple and fast in comparison to the traditional LC-MS/ MS methods for the quantitation of MG and its metabolite in aquaculture products.

AB In this work, we developed a sensitive and highly selective fluorescent approach for the detection of ascorbic acid (AA) by taking advantage of the oxidative etching effect of iodine (I-2) on the lysozymestabilized silver nanoclusters (dLys-AgNCs) with fluorescence quenching. I-2 could be produced from the redox reaction between iodate (IO3-) and AA, and thus the fluorescence intensity of dLys-AgNCs was turned off significantly in the coexistence of IO3- and AA. The fluorescence quenching of dLys-AgNCs had a good linear relationship with AA concentration, which allowed the detection of AA in the range from 0.05 to 45.0 mmol L-1 with a detection limit of 20 nmol L-1. The quenching mechanism was elucidated by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), zeta potential, and dynamic light scattering (DLS) measurements, confirming that the fluorescence quenching of the dLys-AgNCs was attributed to the oxidative etching of the in situ generated I-2, inducing aggregation of the dLys-AgNCs probe by forming Ag@ AgI nanocomposite. The dLys-AgNCs probe exhibited excellent selectivity for AA sensing over several common reducing agents tested. Moreover, this approach was extended to the detection of AA in orange juice and urine with recovery rates in the range of 96.0% (RSD: 4.11) to 100.9% (RSD: 3.28) and 94.5% (RSD: 6.40) to 99.2% (RSD: 5.36), respectively.

AB Theta nanoelectrospray ionization of protein ions formed from aqueous buffer solutions that are mixed with denaturing solutions containing cyclic alkylcarbonates (e. g., vinyl ethylene carbonate; VEC) results in a significant increase in the extent of ion charging compared to native mass spectrometry. For six proteins, the extent of ion charging can be significantly higher than that obtained using denaturing solutions and alternative native "supercharging" methods. In theta nanoelectrospray supercharging, the extent of charging scales with protein mass in agreement with an analytical scaling relationship for ions with elongated structures. Theta nanoelectrospray supercharging of non-covalent complexes from native solutions results in essentially the complete loss of protein-ligand and protein-protein interactions. Based on circular dichroism spectroscopy, VEC can effectively denature proteins in buffered solutions. These data provide evidence that enrichment of VEC in theta nanoelectrospray ionization generated droplets can denature proteins on the timescale of droplet desolvation and ion formation. This approach can be used to form highly charged protein ions from native solutions containing biological buffers, including some that are considered incompatible with native MS. Forming some protein ions in the highest reported charge states directly from native solutions is no longer a challenge in obtaining primary structural information using tandem mass spectrometry.

AB Multivariate curve resolution-alternating least-squares (MCR-ALS) is the model of choice when dealing with some non-trilinear arrays, specifically when the data are of chromatographic origin. To drive the iterative procedure to chemically interpretable solutions, the use of constraints becomes essential. In this work, both simulated and experimental data have been analyzed by MCR-ALS, applying chemically reasonable constraints, and investigating the relationship between selectivity, analytical sensitivity (g) and root mean square error of prediction (RMSEP). As the selectivity in the instrumental modes decreases, the estimated values for g did not fully represent the predictive model capabilities, judged from the obtained RMSEP values. Since the available sensitivity expressions have been developed by error propagation theory in unconstrained systems, there is a need of developing new expressions or analytical indicators. They should not only consider the specific profiles retrieved by MCR-ALS, but also the constraints under which the latter ones have been obtained. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The dried blood spot (DBS) strategy is a convenient and minimally invasive approach to blood sampling. Due to its various advantages, this sampling technique has drawn significant attention in recent years. Hematocrit (HCT)-associated bias is one of the main obstacles that hinder wider DBS application in clinical practice. An accurate HCT estimation method could help calibrate HCT-associated bias and improve the quantification accuracy. This study used a lipidomics profiling strategy to identify HCT estimation markers using liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry (LC-ESIMS), which provided advantages including the potential for the simultaneous measurements of target drug and HCT values. Three sphingomyelins (SMs), specifically SM 44: 1, SM 44: 2, and SM 44: 3, were identified as potential HCT estimation markers. The proposed estimation markers were applied to 54 DBS samples collected from two sets of patients. The analytical results revealed that the estimation errors for all of the HCT values were less than 20%, which demonstrated the feasibility of using the proposed markers to estimate the HCT values for the DBS samples. We suggest that the proposed HCT markers could provide a new strategy for HCT estimation with higher convenience using an LC-ESI-MS platform, which could contribute to wider DBS applications in clinical practice. We also demonstrated that lipidomics is a promising strategy for the discovery of HCT estimation markers in DBS samples. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Safflower Injection is one kind of injections derived from traditional Chinese medicine. It is widely applied to treat cerebrovascular diseases such as acute cerebral infarction, stroke, coronary heart disease, and angiitis. However, most adverse reactions of Safflower Injection in clinic are caused by its quality problems. In this study, 10 batches of normal and 42 batches of abnormal Safflower Injections were obtained from the clinical practice. Their quality fluctuations were detected by chemical fingerprinting (CF, ultra-performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry) and bioassays including cellbased biological profile (CBP) assay and enzymatic assay. CF identified 33 compounds in the Safflower Injections, and scutellarin and kaempferol-3-O-rutinoside were identified to be the possible components responsible for clinical adverse reaction. In addition, 59.5% (25/42), 85.7% (36/42) and 38.1% (16/42) of abnormal samples could be identified by CF, CBP assay and enzymatic assay, respectively. Interestingly, further integration of the three methods could entirely identify all the abnormal samples. It indicated that it is advisable to integrate CF, CBP assay and enzymatic assay for developing quality standard of Safflower Injections. (C) 2017 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

AB In the last decades, the extensive use of chromium in industrial activities has led to the discharge of different chromium species into the biosphere. The two stable chromium forms are Cr(III) and Cr(VI), which have dramatically different properties. While the first one is essential, the second is harmful and carcinogenic, even at very low concentration. Therefore, the appropriate analysis of chromium in environmental, biological, food and other kind of samples need a reliable separation and subsequent quantification of both Cr species. The present paper provides a critical review of chromium speciation methods in which solid phase extraction was employed as sample pretreatment using graphene and carbon nanotubes (and their diverse oxidized, functionalized and magnetic derivatives) as sorbents. The different published methods for the speciation of Cr(III), Cr(VI) or both species are described and classified on the basis of the separation strategy employed: (i) the selective retention of only one of the two species by the sorbent, (ii) the retention of a Cr-chelate formed by using a ligand selective for only one of the Cr-species, or (iii) the sorption of both Cr(III) and Cr(VI) species. In addition, the distinct applied SPE modes (on-column, dispersive or magnetic) and their automation possibilities, the analytical techniques utilized for measurement of the Cr-species after separation, as well as the analytical figures of merit of the methods developed up to date are evaluated. Finally, the expected future trends of solid phase extraction for Cr speciation based on carbon nanomaterials such as graphene, carbon nanotubes and their derivatives as sorbents are commented.

AB The ability to accurately determine the metal content of crude oils is necessary for reasons ranging from the need to identify the source of the oils (Ni and V) to removing components that might inhibit catalysis during refining or impact negatively on the environment during hydrocarbon combustion. Here we show that ashing followed by chemical oxidation and acid digestion, coupled with ICP-MS analysis, provides an accurate method for determining the concentration of metals in crude oil. Nickel and vanadium concentrations were measured in certified Ni and V oil standards and in various light, intermediate and heavy crude oils after application of a single vessel ashing-chemical oxidation-acid digestion sample preparation and storing technique. Prior to the ashing, chemical oxidation and acid digestion, an aliquot of the crude oil was placed in a 10 ml Pyrex T culture tube and capped with quartz wool. The capped culture tubes were then subjected to thermal combustion, followed by chemical oxidation and leaching. The leachates and the aqueous standards were diluted and analyzed for their Ni and V contents using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS).
   The measured concentrations of Ni in oil standards, reported to contain 1, 100, and 1000 mg kg(-1) Ni (+/- 2% error), were 1.1 +/- 0.01, 99.8 +/- 1.46, and 1025 +/- 24 mg kg(-1) respectively. The corresponding concentrations of V in these standards, reported to contain 2, 100, and 1000 mg kg(-1) V, were measured to be 1.93 +/- 0.06, 104 +/- 1.3, and 1027 +/- 7.5 mg kg(-1), respectively. Crude oil samples, A, B, C, D and E, that varied significantly in their composition, and ranged from light to heavy, were determined to contain 5.59 +/- 0.32, 4.05 +/- 0.03, 6.22 +/- 0.22, 33.8 +/- 0.7 and 41.6 +/- 3.5 mg kg(-1) Ni, respectively. Their V contents were determined to be 11.98 +/- 0.1, 12.2 +/- 0.1, 16.5 +/- 0.4, 34.7 +/- 0.4, and 104 +/- 8.9 mg kg(-1), respectively. The results were thus repeatable on average to 4.1% and 2.75% for Ni and V, respectively; the repeatability was worst (similar to 8.5%) for crude oil E, a heavy (viscous) oil with a very high asphaltene content (27.2%).
   This modified single vessel ashing-digestion technique (combustion, chemical oxidation, acid leaching and storing) minimizes contamination and significantly reduces the loss of ash. Our results are repeatable, comparable to, and in some cases superior to those of other methods. The method is applicable to a wide range of crude oil compositions, is very accessible and robust, easy to use, and does not require costly equipment in preparing the samples for analysis by ICP-MS.

AB The re-use of wastewater has been in growing demand but a possible negative feature is the possibility of organic pollutants being present after its treatment. In order to control the presence of contaminants in wastewater, a completely automated methodology capable of determining a total of 55 organic pollutants including pesticides, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), brominated diphenyl ethers (BDEs) and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) at ultra-trace levels has been developed. The proposed method is based on an on-line combination of headspace solid phase microextraction (HS-SPME) and gas chromatography coupled to double-focusing magnetic sector high resolution mass spectrometry (GC-HRMS). HS-SPME as well as GC-HRMS conditions were optimized so as to achieve maximum extraction efficiency and sensitivity which was reinforced by using multiple ion detection (MID) as acquisition mode. Special attention was directed to fiber conditioning and stability by calorimetric and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis.
   Method validation showed good linearity (R-2 > 0.99), recoveries between 86 and 113%, relative standard deviation (RSD) values < 20% for intra-day and inter-day precision and quantification limits (LOQs) between 0.01 and 350 ng L (1). Finally, the proposed method was successfully applied to wastewater samples revealing the presence of PAHs and PCBsS and certain pesticides, mainly anthracene, chlorpyrifos, p,p'-DDD and p,p'-DDT and the metabolite p, p'-DDE.

AB In this work, a simple desorption atmospheric pressure chemical ionization (SDAPCI) source is studied and optimized for analyzing a wide variety of samples such as nonvolatile, volatile and biological samples. In this ion source, the heated mass inlet was used for sample desorption, and a solid needle was used to produce a corona discharge for ionization. The utilization of any additional gas or heater is not required in SDAPCI. Due to its high sensitivity, only a small amount of sample is needed. Sample loading and the consequent mass spectrometry analysis process could be easy and fast, which was demonstrated by the analyses of different types of samples ranging from non-volatile to volatile compounds. High-throughput analysis can be performed by SDAPCI source with minimum or no sample preparation. (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Gene delivery is critical for the development of nucleic acid-based therapies against a range of severe diseases. The conception of non-viral (semi) synthetic vectors with low cytotoxicity and virus-like efficiency is gathering a lot of efforts, but it represents a fantastic challenge still far from accomplishment. Carbohydrate-based scaffolds offer interesting features towards this end, such as easy availability, relatively cheap cost, tuning properties and a good biocompatibility. The lack of analytical methods providing quantitative and qualitative data on their binding properties with oligonucleotides (DNA/RNA), with a minimal time and sample consumption, represents a limitation for these channels. Here, we attempted to fill the gap by hyphenation of capillary electrophoresis with mass spectrometry (CE-MS). This coupling strategy allows discriminating free and complexed DNA oligomers with cationic cyclodextrins (CDs), determining the stoichiometry where the highest observed is always DNA(n):n/3(CD), and unambiguously assigning the partners through m/z detection. Very reliable data were obtained with migration time within 5.5 (standard deviation < 0.5%) and 25 min (standard deviation < 1.1%) for UV and MS detection, respectively. Furthermore, varying the nitrogen/phosphorus ratio (N/P), key parameters relating to the thermodynamics e.g. the micro and macroscopic dissociation constants K-d and K-D, respectively (both in low mu M range) and the Gibbs free energy Delta G (-16.3 to -26.9 kJ mol(-1)), and also the cooperativity as Hill number (nH between 0.98 and 15.75) of the supramolecular process can be delineated, providing a unique tool for the high throughput screening and selection of efficient gene delivery carriers.

AB A simple, low-cost, and sensitive liposome-based colorimetric aptasensor has been developed to detect ochratoxin A (OTA). Specifically, a dumbbell-shaped probe was designed, including magnetic beads (MBs), double-stranded DNA (dsDNA), and enzyme-encapsulated liposome. The dsDNA formed by the hybridization between OTA aptamer and its complementary probe. And the dsDNA was used to contact the MBs and the enzyme-encapsulated liposome. In the presence of OTA, the aptamer preferred to combine with OTA to form G-quadruplex, resulting in the release of the detection probe and the enzyme-encapsulated liposome. Each liposome contained a large amount of HRP. Thus, when the liposome was lysed by adding the mixed solution of 3,3',5,5'-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) and H2O2, a large number of HRP were released. HRP could catalyze the H2O2-mediated oxidation of TMB and hence resulted in the color change from colorless to blue with the OTA concentration varying, and this variation can be observed by naked eyes easily. The result showed that the absorption intensity at 652 nm enhanced with the increase of OTA concentration ranging from 0.05 to 2.0 ng mL(-1), and the limit of detection was calculated to be 0.023 ng mL(-1) (S/N = 3). The developed colorimetric aptasensor has been applied to detect OTA concentration in corn samples with satisfied results. (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Seed-mediated growth has been employed as a simple and powerful means to the shape-controlled synthesis of metal nanocrystals. In this work, we apply the principle of seed-mediated growth in analytical chemistry, and achieve improved sensitivity due to the low energy barrier in the target-induced formation of bimetallic nanoparticles with core-shell structure. As a result, a simple, reliable, highly sensitive and selective method for the detection of ellagic acid (EA), a naturally occurring polyphenolic antioxidant, has been developed. With the aid of EA in alkaline solution, Ag+ ions can be transformed to Ag atoms and deposit on the surfaces of Au nanorods (AuNRs, act as seeds here) to generate Au@Ag core-shell nanorods, accompanied by blue shift of the longitudinal localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) band of AuNRs from near-infrared region to shorter wavelengths. Based on the linear relationship between the wavelength change of longitudinal LSPR band and the concentration of EA, our method achieves a detectable range of 0.2-20 mu M and a limit of detection as low as 40 nM toward EA. This approach is highlighted by its high sensitivity for EA assay, which benefits from the viewpoint of thermodynamics in the nucleation/growth mode of metal nanoparticles. Moreover, this method shows high selectivity for EA detection when potential species coexist, and thus has been successfully applied in the detection of EA in skin-whitening cosmetics. The proposed strategy of seed-mediated growth herein can also be extended to other systems for sensing. (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Working with and analysis of cationic surfactants can be problematic since aqueous concentrations are difficult to control, both when taking environmental aqueous samples as well as performing laboratory work with spiked concentrations. For a selection of 32 amine based cationic surfactants (including C8- to C18-alkylamines, C14-dialkyldimethylammonium, C8-tetraalkylammonium, benzalkonium and pyridinium compounds), the extraction from aqueous samples was studied in detail. Aqueous concentrations were determined using solid phase extraction (SPE; 3 mL/60 mg Oasis WCX-SPE cartridges) with recoveries of >= 80% for 30 compounds, and >= 90% for 16 compounds. Sorption to glassware was evaluated in 120 mL flasks, 40 mL vials and 1.5 mL autosampler vials, using 15 mM NaCl, where the glass binding of simple primary amines and quaternary ammonium compounds increased with alkyl chain length. Sorption to the outside of pipette tips (<= 20% of total amount in solution) when sampling aqueous solutions may interfere with accurate measurements. Polyacrylate solid phase microextraction (PA-SPME) fibers with two coating thicknesses (7 and 35 mm) were tested as potential extraction devices. The uptake kinetics, pH-dependence and influence of ionic strength on sorption to PA fibers were studied. Changing medium from 100 mM Na+ to 10 mM Ca2+ decreases K-fw with one order of magnitude. Results indicate that for PA-SPME neutral amines are absorbed rather than adsorbed, although the exact sorption mechanism remains to be elucidated. Further research remains necessary to establish a definitive applicability domain for PA-SPME. However, results indicate that alkyl chain lengths >= 14 carbon atoms and multiple alkyl chains become problematic. A calibration curve should always be measured together with the samples. In conclusion, it seems that for amine based surfactants PA-SPME does not provide the reliability and reproducibility necessary for precise sorption experiments, specifically for alkyl chain lengths beyond 12 carbon atoms.

AB Quantitative analysis of glycans is an emerging field in glycomic research. Herein we present a rapid and effective dual-labeling strategy, in the combination of isotopic derivatization of N-glycosylamine-based glycans by d0/d5-benzoyl chloride and methylamidation of sialic acids, to relatively quantify both neutral and sialylated N-glycans simultaneously by MALDI-MS. The derivatization efficiencies were increased by microwave-accelerated deglycosylation which not only largely reduce the time of glycoprotein deglycosylation but also inhibit the hydrolysis of intermediate glycosylamines produced by PNGase F digestion. Three model glycoproteins, including RNase B, bovine fetuin and IgG from human serum, were applied to validate this technique. Results showed that the glycans from microgram level of glycoprotein can be successfully quantified with high reproducibility and the whole time of analytical procedure was shortened to 4 h. Furthermore, this proposed method was applied for the comparative analysis of N-glycans from serum of healthy donors and multiple myeloma patients. It was found that five N-glycans may be as the potential biomarkers for rapid detection of early multiple myeloma, indicating the feasibility of this strategy in monitoring subtle quantitative differences of serum glycomics.

AB An electrochemical sensor was fabricated for arsenite detection using graphene oxide-assisted generation of prussian blue nanoparticles as enhanced redox signal label. The 5'-thiolate-labeled (GT)(21)-ssDNA was first self-assembled on a gold electrode surface via Au-S bond. Graphene oxide can interact with ssDNA through pi-pi stacking interaction and facilitate the generation of prussian blue nanoparticles on its surface as an electrochemically active indicator. In the absence of arsenite, plenty of graphene oxide/prussian blue nanoparticles can be adsorbed on the electrode surface to produce a stronger redox signal of prussian blue nanoparticles. While in the presence of arsenite, (GT)(21)-ssDNA can recognize and combine with arsenite via hydrogen bonds to form (GT)(21)-ssDNA/arsenite complex with a frizzy structure. The conformational change of (GT)(21)-ssDNA led to less adsorption of graphene oxide/prussian blue nanoparticles on the electrode surface, resulting in a reduced redox response. The arsenite-induced (GT)(21)-ssDNA structure switching can be used for sensitive detection of arsenite with a linear range from 0.2 to 500 ppb and a detection limit down to 0.058 ppb. Benefiting from (GT)(21)-ssDNA containing arsenite recognition sequence, the proposed sensor exhibited excellent specificity against other heavy metal ions. The applicability of the electrochemical biosensor for arsenite assay in real water samples demonstrated the great potential of this strategy for trace arsenite detection in environment.

AB Paper-based analytical devices introduce an innovative platform technology for fluid handling and analysis, with wide range of applications, promoting low cost, ease of fabrication/operation and equipment independence. This review gives a general overview on the fabrication techniques reported to date, revealing and discussing their weak points as well as the newest approaches in order to overtake current mass production limitations and therefore commercialisation. Moreover, this review aims especially to highlight novel technologies appearing in literature for the effective handling and controlling of fluids. The lack of flow control is the main problem of paper-based analytical devices, which generates obstacles for marketing and slows down the transition of paper devices from the laboratory into the consumers' hands.

AB DNA methyltransferase (MTase) plays an important role in many biological processes and has been recognized as a predictive cancer biomarker far before other signs of malignancy and a therapeutic target in cancer treatment. Thus simple and sensitive determination of DNA MTase activity is urgently required. The commercially available glucometer is considered as the most successful point-of-care (POC) sensor up to date, and researchers extend its application in monitoring different types of targets rather than only glucose. Here, we developed a simple strategy for the sensitive detection of the DNA MTase (using M.SssI as an example) activity by using a glucometer as the signal transducer. A S1/S2 hybrid probe was designed including a specific recognition sequence for both DNA MTase and restriction endonuclease, and a complementary sequence for biotin-S3. Firstly, the S1/S2 hybrid probe was self-assembled on the gold electrode and methylated by M. SssI MTase to form the methylated dsDNA. Then, HpaII endonuclease specifically cleaved the residue of the unmethylated dsDNA. Subsequently, biotin-S3 hybridized with the overhang sequence of the methylated dsDNA. Finally, the biotin tag was successively combined with streptavidin (STV) and biotin-invertase. The invertase efficiently catalyzed the hydrolysis of sucrose to generate abundant glucose, which led to an amplified response of glucometer. This strategy could detect DNA MTase activity as low as 0.3 U mL(-1) with good selectivity against other two cytosine MTases (HaeIII MTase and AluI MTase), and be successfully applied for screening the DNA MTase inhibitors (5-azacytidine and 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine), implying our proposed method holds great promising application in early cancer diagnosis and therapeutics.

AB Herein, a di-branched di-anchoring dye, T(TA)(2), with triphenylamine as electron donor, thiophene as electron transfer pi-bridge, and acrylic acid as both acceptor and anchoring groups, was synthesized and coupled with TiO2 nanoparticles for the highly sensitive photoelectrochemical (PEC) assay of organophosphate pesticides (OPs). The T(TA)(2) exhibited good anchoring stability to TiO2 nanoparticles in neutral buffer solutions. Under 2 h continual irradiation, the T(TA)(2)-TiO2 nanocomposites respectively kept 99.7% and 85.9% of their initial photocurrents in neutral Tris-HCl and phosphate buffer solutions. Neither degradation nor desorption of T(TA)(2) from TiO2 nanoparticles was observed during the continual irradiation in the Tris-HCl solutions. The stability was not only superior to its analogues either possessing one branch, with cyanoacrylic acid as anchoring groups, or without thiophene in the pi-bridge, but also better than the Ru(II) complex N719 and the porphyrin dye sensitized TiO2 nanocomposites. The nanocomposites also showed highly photocatalytic ability towards the oxidation of ascorbic acid and thiocholine (TCh). Since the latter is the enzymatic hydrolysis product of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and the activity of AChE can be inhibited by OPs, the T(TA)(2)-TiO2/FTO was further used for PEC assay of OPs. Using parathion as a model analyte, the PEC method showed a wide linear range from 2 x 10(-12) -4 x 10(-6) g mL(-1) and an extremely low limit of detection of 5.6 x 10(-13) g mL(-1). Regarding these good analytical performances, this study may provide some guidance and pave the way for the applications of dye-TiO2 nanocomposites in a lot of PEC devices required to be performed in aqueous solutions.

AB An automated magnetic dispersive micro-solid phase extraction procedure in a fluidized reactor was developed for the determination of fluoroquinolone antimicrobial drugs (fleroxacin, norfloxacin and ofloxacin) in meat-based baby food samples. A stepwise injection system was successfully combined with afluidized reactorand applied for the magnetic dispersive micro-solid phase extraction procedure automation. The developed automated procedure involved injection of the sample solution into the fluidized reactor followed by the on-line separation of the analytes from the sample matrix based on fluidized beds strategy using magnetic nanoparticles, elution and determination of the analytes using a high performance liquid chromatography system with fluorescence detection. The floating of the magnetic nanoparticles in a liquid sample phase was accomplished by air-bubbling. In the developed method Zr-Fe-C magnetic nanoparticles were used as an efficient sorbent for the determination of fleroxacin, norfloxacin and ofloxacin. Under the optimal conditions, the calibration graphs were linear over the concentration ranges of 10-1000 mu g L-1 for fleroxacin (R-2 = 0.996), 5-1000 mu g L-1 for norfloxacin (R-2 = 0.998) and ofloxacin (R-2 = 0.998). The limits of detection, calculated from the blank tests based on 3 sigma, were 3.0 mu g L-1 forfleroxacin, 1.5 mu g L-1 for norfloxacin and ofloxacin. The limits of quantification, calculated from the blank tests based on 10 sigma, were 10 mu g L-1 forfleroxacin, 5 mu g L-1 for norfloxacin and ofloxacin. The method was applied for the determination of fluoroquinolonesin meat-based baby food samples and the results were compared with those obtained by the reference method. The recovery values for all analytes were within of 86-122% range. (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Benefiting from high sensitivity and great ability to measure multiple samples simultaneously, isobaric tandem Mass spectrometry (MS2) quantification has been widely applied for protein biomarker screening. Here, a newly developed isobaric MS2 quantification method named triplex quantification by isobaric termini labeling (Triplex-QITL) was established. This method enables the accurate comparison of various fragment ions (reporter ions, amino acid fragments and N-/C-terminal fragments) based quantification to be operated in a single run. To our knowledge, this is the first time that this kind of comparison is achieved. In Triplex-QITL, proteins were first digested with Lys-C to produce peptides with lysine (K) at the C-termini, then dimethylation reagents and mTRAQ reagents were used to label the N-termini and C-termini of the peptides respectively. N- and C-terminal fragment ion pairs, reporter ions from mTRAQ (113,117,121) and a(1) ion pairs were simultaneously generated in MS2 spectra. In simple sample experiment, not much difference in using various fragment ions for quantification was observed. When analyzing SW480 cell lysate, comparing with a1 ions, about two times of reproducible quantification results were achieved by reporter ions and N- and C-terminal ions. Meanwhile the measured quantification results were much closer to the expected results even in large ratios (1:10:10) using N- and C-terminal ions. Finally, Triplex-QITL was successfully applied to profile metastatic differences of three hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cell lines. In all, Triplex-QITL shows a promising future in quantitative proteomics. (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB There is an increasing demand for donor human milk to feed infants for various reasons including that a mother may be unable to provide sufficient amounts of milk for their child or the milk is considered unsafe for the baby. Selling and buying human milk via the Internet has gained popularity. However, there is a risk of human milk sold containing other adulterants such as animal or plant milk. Analytical tools for rapid detection of adulterants in human milk are needed. We report a quantitative metabolomics method for detecting potential milk adulterants (soy, almond, cow, goat and infant formula milk) in human milk. It is based on the use of a high-performance chemical isotope labeling (CIL) LC-MS platform to profile the metabolome of an unknown milk sample, followed by multivariate or univariate comparison of the resultant metabolomic profile with that of human milk to determine the differences. Using dansylation LC-MS to profile the amine/phenol submetabolome, we could detect an average of 4129 +/- 297 (n = 9) soy metabolites, 3080 +/- 470 (n = 9) almond metabolites, 4256 +/- 136 (n = 18) cow metabolites, 4318 +/- 198 (n = 9) goat metabolites, 4444 +/- 563 (n = 9) infant formula metabolites, and 4020 +/- 375 (n = 30) human metabolites. This high level of coverage allowed us to readily differentiate the six different types of samples. From the analysis of binary mixtures of human milk containing 5, 10, 25, 50 and 75% other type of milk, we demonstrated that this method could be used to detect the presence of as low as 5% adulterant in human milk. We envisage that this method could be applied to detect contaminant or adulterant in other types of food or drinks. (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Ehrlichia canis is an intracellular parasitic bacterium and arthropod-borne pathogen that receives growing attention, because it leads to increasing morbidity and mortality in animals. It does so by causing canine monocytotropic ehrlichiosis (CME). Infected canines may lack obvious clinical signs and stay in chronic stage. Herein we report a rapid screening method based on PCR assay combined with quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) to design a DNA sensor for detecting E. canis in early stages of infection. The test relies on DNA amplification of target nucleotide sequences via PCR followed by detecting DNA-DNA hybridization using QCM. The approach did not result in any cross-hybridization toward other blood bacteria or parasites in dogs, such as Anaplasma platys, Babesia canis and Trypanosoma spp, but turned out selective for the target species. The limit of detection of QCM was as low as 4.1 x 10(9) molecules/mu l of 289 bp E. canis PCR products corresponding to 22 copy numbers/mu l of E. canis. Furthermore, the technique is also simple, does not require complicated equipment and can in principle be reused. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this work, the luminophor tris (4,4'-dicarboxylicacid-2,2'-bipyridyl) ruthenium (II) dichloride (Ru(dcbpy)(3)(2+)) was linked to coreactant polyethylenimine (PEI) with effectively shorted distance, forming a novel self-enhanced PEI-Ru(II) complex to fabricate ultrasensitive electrochemiluminescence immunosensor for carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) detection by using polyamino acid L-cysteine (pL-Cys) as booster for further signal amplification. The light-emitting species (PEI-Ru(II)*) based on intramolecular electron transfer between PEI center dot and Ru(III) could efficiently amplify the ECL signal of Ru(dcbpy)(3)(2+) owing to its benefit for electron transmission. Secondly, the pL-Cys film was fabricated on the glassy carbon electrode by cyclic voltammogram. After that, the pL-Cys acted as a strongly reducing radical could react with PEI-Ru(III) to generate the excited state PEI-Ru(II)*, which further amplify the ECL signal. With the signal amplification factors, the prepared ECL immunosensor exhibited great advantages in simplification, rapidity, stability and selectivity. Furthermore, the linear range for the determination of CEA was from 0.10 pg/mL to 80 ng/mL with a correlation coefficient of 0.9942 and a detection limit of 0.045 pg/mL (S/N = 3).

AB The enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) has become the most important and widely used rapid detection technology for food safety because of its simple operation, fast speed and high sensitivity. Multiplex synchronous detection is the goal of ELISA that is always pursuing for. However, the reported multiplex ELISAs have not truly realized synchronous detection because of the complex signal generation and collection procedures. Here, we developed a dual-luciferases competitive direct bioluminescent immunoassay (DBL-cdELISA) with only one substrate addition step followed immediately by simultaneous signal acquisition. It is the first report of simultaneous multiplex analysis of small molecules based on microtiter plates and enzymes without any additional steps. The IC50 values for norfloxacin (NOR) and sulfamethazine (SMZ) were 0.051 ng mL(-1) and 0.211 ng mL(-1), respectively. The results demonstrated that the application of different luciferases and substrates simplified the signal generation and collection procedures and enabled simultaneous detection of small molecules with a simple procedure, high throughput and fast speed, that will be of great significance for the development of multiple assays.

AB In the present work, a novel metal-organic framework (MOF) fluorescent probe was prepared by post-synthetic modification of MIL-53-NH2(Al) with carboxylatocalix[4]arene (CC[4]A). The introduced CC [4]A could not only enhance the fluorescence performance and the recognition ability of the probe, but also sustain the high stability under UV light and moisture conditions. A method based on the as-synthesized CC[4]A@MIL-53-NH2(Al) probe was established for sensing hippuric acid. The detection limit was determined to be as low as 3.7 mu g mL(-1). Over the concentration range of 0.005-3 mgmL(-1), the calibration curve was obtained with a satisfactory linearity (R-2 = 0.993). The method was successfully used for rapid and highly selective direct monitor of hippuric acid in human urine. The sensor had great potential to be used as a simple diagnostic tool for hippuric acid in human urine which is regarded as a biological index of toluene exposure. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.
