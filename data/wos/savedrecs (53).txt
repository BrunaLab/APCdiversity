AB Quercetin is a flavonoid with strong antioxidant and antiinflammatory activities considered as a potential drug candidate for skin exogenous supplementation. Nevertheless, crude quercetin suffers from poor water solubility and consequently topical inactivity. Therefore, quercetin formulation within a suitable system that overcomes its solubility limitation is a matter of investigation. Three approaches were tested to improve quercetin delivery to skin: liposomes, lipid nanocapsules (LNC) and smartCrystals (R). These nanoformulations were compared in terms of average particle size, homogeneity (PDI), quercetin loading and cellular interactions with HaCaT (keratinocytes) and TPH-1 (monocytes) cell lines. Finally, two formulations were selected for testing quercetin delivery to human skin in vivo using stripping test. Different size distribution was obtained with each strategy starting from 26 nm with quercetin LNC, 179 nm with liposomes to 295 nm with quercetin smartCrystals (R). The drug loading varied with each formulation from 0.56 mg/ml with liposomes, 10.8 mg/ml with LNC to 14.4 mg/ml with smartCrystals (R). No toxicity was observed in HaCaT cells with quercetin and free radical scavenging ability was established at 5 mu g/ml. The safety of quercetin at 5 mu g/ml was further confirmed on THP-1 cells with efficient free radical scavenging ability. Finally, skin penetration evidenced different behavior between the two selected forms (LNC and SmartCrystals (R)), which could lead to different promising strategies for skin protection. On one side, quercetin smartCrystals (R) seems to enable the superficial deposition of quercetin on top of the skin, which presents a good strategy for a quercetin-based sunscreen product. On the other side, LNC seems to allow quercetin delivery to viable epidermis that holds the promise for skin inflammatory disorders such as psoriasis.

AB Having previously highlighted the gelation of pectin with chlorhexidine (CX), pectinate microparticles were prepared here by vibrational prilling using CX, not only as an active ingredient encapsulated but also as a cross-linking agent. CX amount required for pectin gelation was smaller than usual dications (Ca2+, Zn2+) used as cross-linking agent for pectin ionotropic gelation: CX seemed to bind more easily to pectin chains that could be explained by its large molecular size. Three batches of CX microparticles with different mean size were prepared. Whatever the droplet mean diameter, similar particle characteristics in terms of encapsulation efficiency, CX encapsulation yield and drug release were observed. The encapsulation efficiency was about 5.5%, the CX encapsulation yield was approximately 44% and the maximal amount of CX released after 6 h was about 7%. Finally, zinc diacetate was added to the formulation as a competitive pectin cross-linking agent in order to limit CX binding to pectin and to improve CX release. The influence of CX and Zn2+ concentrations on the particles properties was studied by the means of a Doehlert design. Results showed the interest of such a mixture since the competition between both cations led to more or less structured and large microparticles, some of them having promoted the quantity of CX released.

AB Nucleic acid-based targeting of nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappa B) is gaining attention as a treatment option for skin diseases like atopic dermatitis (AD). Transdermal administration improves patient quality of life because of non-invasive; however, siRNA delivery into the skin can be challenging owing to the barrier of tight junctions in the granular layer. Therefore, we aimed to develop a delivery system of siRNA for topical skin application using functional peptides. We previously reported that combined treatment with a cytoplasm-responsive stearylated-arginine-rich peptide (STR-CH2R4H2C) and a tight junction opening peptide (AT1002) showed high siRNA permeability in the skin of AD-induced and normal mice. Here, we used murine macrophage RAW264.7 cells to examine siRNA permeation and the therapeutic effect of anti-NF-kappa B (RelA) siRNA (siRelA) complexed with STRCH2R4H2C and AT1002 for AD-induced mice. We showed that significantly higher siRNA cellular uptake occurs after this treatment as well as decreased TNF-alpha and IL-6 expression. Additionally, we showed that effective siRNA transdermal delivery occurs with the suppression of the tight junction protein ZO-1. Moreover, topical skin application of siRelA with STR-CH2R4H2C and AT1002 improved AD-like symptoms in model mice. Thus, the combined treatment of STR-CH2R4H2C and AT1002 could serve as an effective transdermal siRNA therapeutic system for AD.

AB Crosstalk among immune cells has attracted considerable attention with the advent of immunotherapy as a novel therapeutic approach for challenging diseases, especially cancer, which is the leading cause of mortality worldwide. Dendritic cells-the key antigen-presenting cells-play a pivotal role in immunological response by presenting exogenous epitopes to T cells, which induces the self-defense mechanisms of the body. Furthermore, nanotechnology has provided promising ways for diagnosing and treating cancer in the last decade. The progress in nanoparticle drug carrier development, combined with enhanced understanding of the immune system, has enabled harnessing of anti-tumor immunity. This review focuses on the recent advances in nanotechnology that have improved the therapeutic efficacy of immunotherapies, with emphasis on dendritic cell physiology and its role in presenting antigens and eliciting therapeutic T cell response.

AB Multidrug resistance to chemotherapeutic drugs is a major obstacle to breast cancer treatment. In this study, doxorubicin (DOX) and imatinib (IM) were co-loaded into folate receptor targeted (FR-targeted) pH-sensitive liposomes (denoted as FPL-DOX/IM) to fulfill intracellular acid-sensitive release and reverse drug resistance. FPL-DOX/IM could maintain stability in blood circulation with approximate diameters of 100 nm and rapidly release encapsulated drugs in tumor acidic microenvironment. Moreover, the IM in combination therapy could overcome chemoresistance associated with DOX effectively by inhibiting ABC transporter function and improving chemotherapy sensitivity. The designed liposomes co-loaded with DOX and IM significantly enhanced anti-tumor effects both in vitro and in vivo. These findings suggest that FPL-DOX/IM provides a novel strategy to improve chemotherapeutic efficacy against MDR tumors.

AB The notion that certain formerly regarded "inert" pharmaceutical excipients are capable of modifying the bioavailability of oral drugs has gained increasing attention in recent years. For instance, the commonly-used solubilizing agent polyethylene glycol 400 (PEG 400) exhibits a sex-specific effect on the bioavailability of ranitidine in both humans and rats, mediated by the efflux transporter P-glycoprotein (P-gp). To determine whether such in vivo effect could be predicted by in vitro tests, an in vitro/ex vivo model was established using tissues from male and female rats to characterize the influence of PEG 400 on the intestinal transport of ranitidine in the absence and/or presence of a Pgp inhibitor, cyclosporine A (CsA). We found the absorptive permeability of ranitidine in the small intestine (duodenum, jejunum, ileum) and colon was higher in females compared with males. PEG 400 significantly increased the absorption and decreased the secretion of ranitidine in the intestine of male rats (p < 0.05), but no such effects were observed in female intestines. In addition, while the P-gp inhibitor CsA increased the intestinal uptake of ranitidine in both male and female rats, a greater extent of intestinal transport modulation was observed in males compared to females. These in vitro data on the influence of PEG 400 on the intestinal transport of ranitidine in a sex-dependent manner are in agreement with previously published in vivo data. This good in vivo-in vitro correlation means that the in vitro method will be quicker, cheaper and easier to investigate any sex-related influence of pharmaceutical excipients on oral drug bioavailability.

AB Vaccine development efforts against Streptococcus suis serotype 2 (S. suis 2) are often constrained by strain/serotype antigen variability. Bioinformatics analyses revealed two highly conserved S. suis 2 factors, EF-Tu and FtsZ. Murine immunization with recombinant proteins emulsified in white oil adjuvant or eukaryotic DNA vaccine vectors provided significant protection against lethal S. suis 2 challenge. Immune responses elicited by recombinant protein immunization revealed the robust generation of humoral immune responses, with a mixed induction of Th1-type and Th2-type responses. Furthermore, the antiserum from mice immunized with recombinant proteins significantly inhibited the growth of S. suis 2 in healthy pig whole blood, suggesting the triggering of a strong opsonizing response. Histological examination found that immunizing mice with purified recombinant proteins reduced neutrophil and macrophage accumulation in brain and lung tissues after challenge with virulent S. suis. Taken together, these findings reveal that EF-Tu and FtsZ may be promising targets for subunit and DNA vaccine candidates against S. suis 2 infection. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background: Most studies use indirect cohort or case-control methods to estimate vaccine effectiveness (VE) of 7- and 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCV7 and PCV13) against invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD). Neither method can measure the benefit vaccination programs afford the unvaccinated and many studies were unable to estimate dose-specific VE. We linked Australia's national immunisation register with health data from two states to calculate IPD incidence by vaccination status and VE for a 3 + 0 PCV schedule (doses at 2, 4, 6 months, no booster) among a cohort of 1.4 million births.
   Methods: Births records for 2001-2012 were probabilistically linked to IPD notifications, hospitalisations, deaths, and vaccination history (available until December 2013). IPD rates in vaccinated and unvaccinated children <2 years old were compared using Cox proportional hazards models (adjusting for potential confounders), with VE = (1 - adjusted hazard ratio) x 100. Separate models were performed for all-cause, PCV7, PCV13 and PCV13-non-PCV7 serotype-specific IPD, and for Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal children.
   Results: Following introduction of universal PCV7 in 2005, rates of PCV7 serotype and all-cause IPD in unvaccinated children declined 89.5% and 61.4%, respectively, to be similar to rates in vaccinated children. Among non-Aboriginal children, VEs for 3 doses were 94.2% (95%Cl: 81.9-98.1) for PCV7 serotype-specific IPD, 85.6% (95%Cl: 60.5-94.8) for PCV13-non-PCV7 serotype-specific IPD and 80.1% (95%Cl: 59.4-90.3) for all-cause IPD. There were no statistically significant differences between the VEs for 3 doses and for 1 or 2 doses against PCV13 and PCV13-non-PCV7 serotype-specific IPD, or between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal children.
   Conclusion: Our population-based cohort study demonstrates that >90% coverage in the first year of a universal 3 + 0 PCV program provided high population-level protection, predominantly attributable to strong herd effects. The size of the cohort enabled calculation of robust dose-specific VE estimates for important population sub-groups relevant to vaccination policies internationally. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Background: This study was to investigate parental acceptability of HPV vaccination for their sons and daughters aged 9-13 years under different cost scenarios, and factors associated with parental acceptability at market price.
   Methods: Participants were: (1) Chinese speaking parents aged 18-60 years with a Hong Kong ID card; (2) had a son or a daughter aged 9-13 years at the date of the survey; (3) the child had the right to abode in Hong Kong. Random telephone numbers were selected from up:to-date telephone directories of Hong Kong. A total of 300 eligible parents (boys' parents: 162; girls' parents: 138, response rate: 68.9% & 69%) provided verbal informed consent and completed the anonymous telephone interview during March to October 2016. Using parental acceptability of HPV vaccination at market price as the dependent variable, univariate and multiple logistic regression models were fitted.
   Results: The prevalence of HPV vaccination was very low among boys and girls (0.6% vs. 2.2%, p = 0.242). Among those whose children had not taken up HPV vaccination, the prevalence of parental acceptability of HPV vaccination for the index son and daughter were: 14.9% and 27.4% (market price), and 51.6% and 63.0% (free vaccination). Adjusted for sociodemographic variables, attitudinal variables based on the Health Belief Model were associated with parental acceptability of HPV vaccination for their sons (perception that it was not worthy, perceived cue to action from mass media and perceived self-efficacy) and for their daughters (perceived susceptibility and perceived severity of HPV infection among females, perceived benefit of HPV vaccination and perceived self-efficacy).
   Conclusion: Coverage of HPV vaccination among children aged 9-13 years was very low. Instead of waiting for the free universal vaccination to become available, promotion of self-paid HPV vaccination targeting parents is urgently needed. Different strategies should be applied to boys' and girls' parents. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Vaccination has been associated with a transient increase in viremia in HIV-infected individuals, although contradicting evidence persist in the literature. As part of a randomized placebo-controlled efficacy trial of the PCV7 in Malawi, we collected viral load and CD4+ T-cell counts from 237 adults who received two doses of vaccine or placebo, administered 4 weeks apart. Analyses were conducted separately for cART and non-CART users. Our analysis show no difference in viral loads between vaccine and placebo groups, regardless of cART use. Viremia decreased from 4.1 to 2.9 log(10) copies/mL (p < 0.0001) among those using cART, consistent vaccine and placebo groups, but no changes were seen among the non-CART cohort. CD4+ T-cell counts remained unchanged regardless of cART use, or allocation to vaccine or placebo. We concluded that there was no evidence of detrimental effects of PCV7 administration on viral load or CD4+ T-cell counts six months after vaccination with PCV7. (C) 2018 The Authors.

AB Paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria (PNH) is a rare acquired haematopoietic stem cell disease which causes defects in complement inhibiting proteins. The disease presents classically with the triad of haemolytic anaemia, pancytopenia and thrombosis. Eculizumab, a humanized antibody that blocks the cleavage of complement factor 5, was approved for PNH treatment in 2007 and has improved patients' survival since then. However, several cases of invasive meningococcal disease (IMD) have been reported in eculizumab-treated patients, mostly caused by serogroup B infection which was not covered by the previously administered vaccine (MenACWY). We report a rare case of septic shock due to infection with Neisseria meningitis serogroup B despite prior vaccination with 4CMenB in a young PNH patient treated with eculizumab. There are increasing doubts over whether vaccination ensures sufficient immunoprotection against IMD in patients receiving eculizumab. Therefore, besides monitoring the immune response, lifelong chemoprophylaxis should be considered. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Objectives: To systematically review the economic evaluations of 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPV23) in adults aged >= 60 years to inform the development of local studies through the discussion of parameters and assumptions that influence the results of the analyses.
   Methods: We searched the MEDLINE, Excerpta Medica, Cochrane Library, Latin-American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature (LILACS), Brazilian Regional Library of Medicine, National Health Service Economic Evaluation, and Centre for Reviews and Dissemination-as well as the Scopus citation index and the Web of Science for full economic evaluations of PPV23 published up to March 2016. Two independent reviewers screened the articles for relevance and extracted the data. Main study characteristics and methods (clinical and epidemiological data, cost and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were extracted and compared. Costs were updated to 2016 international dollars.
   Results: Twenty-seven studies published from 1980 to 2016 were reviewed. Most studies were conducted in Europe and the USA; three studies were conducted in Latin America (Brazil, 2; Colombia, 1). In addition to the scenario comparing the vaccination with the PPV23 to non-vaccination, three studies also compared PPV23 to pneumococcal conjugate 13-valent vaccine (PCV13). All studies used static models. Most used a lifetime (44.4%) or 5-6 year's time horizon (33.3%). Only three studies considered herd protection from children immunization with PCV13 in the model. Most studies considered PPV23 cost-effective (less than US$50,000 per LYG or QALY) and sometimes cost-saving (results ranging from cost saving to US$84,636/QALY). The estimates of disease burden, the efficacy/effectiveness of PPV23, and the effects of herd protection from childhood immunization had most influence on the results.
   Conclusions: Well-designed cost-effectiveness studies of PPV23 that represent the current epidemiological scenario and reduce uncertainty related to efficacy/effectiveness are extremely relevant to informing the decision-making process. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Longer life expectancy and decreasing fertility rates mean that the proportion of older people is continually increasing worldwide, and particularly in Europe. Ageing is associated with an increase in the risk and severity of infectious diseases. These diseases are also more difficult to diagnose and manage in seniors who often have at least one comorbid condition (60% of seniors have two or more conditions). Infectious diseases increase the risk of hospitalization, loss of autonomy and death in seniors. Effective vaccines are available in Europe for infectious diseases such as influenza, pneumococcal diseases, herpes zoster, diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis. Their effectiveness has been demonstrated in terms of reducing the rates of hospitalization, disability, dependency and death. The prevention of diseases in seniors also results in savings in healthcare and societal costs each year in Europe. Despite the availability of vaccines, vaccine-preventable diseases affect millions of European citizens annually, with the greatest burden of disease occurring in seniors, and the medical and economic benefits associated with are not being achieved. Vaccination coverage rates must be improved to achieve the full benefits of vaccination of seniors in Europe. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background: The success of human papillomavirus (HPV) national immunization program depends on effective strategies in optimizing the uptake of HPV vaccine. Given the increasing number of economic evaluations, this review was conducted to update the economic evidence on HPV vaccination, by focusing on: (i) 9-valent vaccine compared to bi- or quadrivalent vaccine; (ii) gender-neutral vaccination compared to female only vaccination; and (iii) multiple age cohort immunization compared to single age cohort immunization.
   Methods: Searches were performed until June 2016 using 4 databases: PubMed; Embase; Cochrane Library; and LILACS. The combined WHO, Drummond and CHEERS checklist were used to evaluate the quality of included studies.
   Results: Thirty-four studies were included in the review and most of them were conducted in high income countries. The inclusion of adolescent boys in vaccination program was found to be costeffective if vaccine price and coverage was low. When coverage for female was above 75%, gender neutral vaccination was less cost-effective than when targeting only girls aged 9-18 years. Current evidence does not show conclusive proof of greater cost-effectiveness of 9-valent vaccine compared to the older HPV vaccines as the price for 9-valent vaccine was still uncertain. Multicohort immunization strategy was cost-effective in the age range 9-14 years but the upper age limit at which vaccination was no longer cost-effective needs to be further investigated. Key influential parameters identified were duration of vaccine protection, vaccine price, coverage, and discounting rates.
   Conclusions: These findings are expected to support policy-makers in making recommendations for HPV immunization programs on either switching to the 9-valent vaccine or inclusion of adolescent boys' vaccination or extending the age of vaccination. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Objective: Genital warts and human papillomavirus (HPV)-associated cancers in men can be substantially reduced through HPV vaccination; yet, globally, HPV vaccine uptake among boys remains low. This meta ethnography synthesizes qualitative studies to understand, in-depth, HPV vaccine acceptability and decision-making among adolescent boys and/or their parents.
   Methods: A systematic search identified qualitative studies examining HPV vaccines from the perspectives of boys and/or boys' parents. The Consolidated Criteria for Reporting Qualitative Research (COREQ) 32-item checklist was used to assess quality of reporting. Using meta-ethnographic techniques, we conducted a structured and iterative process of data analysis, coded original studies, and then developed descriptive and analytic themes to synthesize the findings.
   Results: Review of 15 eligible studies (n = 3362 parents, n = 39 boys) revealed multilevel factors that influence HPV vaccine acceptability and decision-making among adolescent boys and their parents: (1) individual, e.g., low HPV vaccine knowledge/awareness, (2) interpersonal, e.g., key relationships between parents, sons, and healthcare providers (HCP), (3) community/societal, e.g., parental duty to protect, and (4) systemic, e.g., HPV vaccine messaging. Parents generally accepted adolescent boys' sexuality and the need for vaccination, motivated by wanting to protect their sons from HPV and HPV-associated cancers, and valued HCP-initiated discussion and recommendation. Acceptability was mitigated by low awareness/knowledge of HPV vaccines and low perceived benefits for boys, lack of HCP-initiated discussion, out-of-pocket costs, multiple doses, stigma, and mixed messages about HPV.
   Conclusions: Multilevel factors influence HPV vaccine acceptability and decision-making among parents and their adolescent sons. Providing clear and unambiguous messages about HPV vaccines for whom (boys and girls), for what (genital warts and cancers in men), and when (before sexual debut) through increased HCP-initiated discussion and targeted public health campaigns may support HPV vaccine uptake among boys. Future research should consistently disaggregate findings by sex of child and parent, and explore effective messaging tailored for boys and parents. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background: In March 2010, the 10-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV10) was introduced into the routine immunization program in Brazil. We describe the pneumococcal serotypes that caused invasive pneumococcal diseases (IPD) before and after the introduction of PCV10 using data from a national laboratory-based surveillance system.
   Method: We compared the prevalence of vaccine types (VT) and non-vaccine types (NVT) of Streptococcus pneumoniae in three periods, pre-PCV10 (January/2005-December/2009), early post-PCV10 (January/2010-December/2013), and late post-PCV10 (January/2014-December/2015), by episode in meningitis and non-meningitis cases and by age group. Changes in serotype prevalence in the early and late post-PCV10 periods were determined using pre-PCV10 period as a reference.
   Results: A total of 8971 IPD isolates from patients aged 2 months to 99 years were analyzed. In the late post-PCV10 period, the VT-IPD reduction in the 2-month to 4-year age group was 83.4% for meningitis and 87.4% for non-meningitis cases: in the age groups 5-17 years, 18-64 years, and >65 years, VT declined by 56.1%, 54.1%, and 47.4%, respectively, in meningitis cases, and by 60.9%, 47.7%, and 53.4%, respectively, in non-meningitis cases. NVT-IPD increased throughout the study period, driven mainly by serotypes 3, 6C, and 19A, which remained the predominant types causing IPD in the late post-PCV10 period.
   Conclusion: We observed direct and indirect PCV10 protection against IPD caused by VT and a shift in the distribution of serotypes 5 years after the introduction of PCV10. Continued IPD surveillance is needed to evaluate the sustainability of the high prevalence of serotypes 3, 6C, and 19A, which were not included in PCV10. (C) 2018 The Author(s).

AB Background: Human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination has been routinely recommended at age 11-12 years in the United States for females since 2006 and males since 2011. Coverage can be estimated using self/parent-reported HPV vaccination collected in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) for a wider age range than other national surveys. We assessed vaccination coverage in 2015-2016, temporal trends by age, and the validity of self/parent-reported vaccination status.
   Methods: Participants aged 9-59 years completed an interview collecting demographic and vaccination information. Weighted coverage was estimated for two-year NHANES cycles by age group for 2007-2008 to 2015-2016 for females (N = 14318) and 2011-2012 to 2015-2016 for males (N 7847). Temporal trends in coverage were assessed from 2007-2008 to 2011-2012 for females and from 2011-2012 to 2015-2016 for both sexes. Sensitivity and specificity of self/parent-reported vaccination were assessed using provider-verified vaccination records from a pilot study in 14-29 year-olds.
   Results: In 2015-2016, >= 1 dose coverage among females was highest in 14-19 (54.7%) and 20-24 (56.0%) year-olds and lower in successively older age groups. Among males, >= 1 dose coverage was highest in 1419 year-olds (39.5%) and lower at older ages. Coverage was similar in 9-13 year-old females and males. Between 2007-2008 and 2011-2012, there were increases among females younger than 30 years. Between 2011-2012 and 2015-2016, there were increases among female age groups including 20-39 year-olds; male coverage increased among ages 9-13, 14-19, and 20-24 years. Self/parent-reported receipt of >= 1 dose had a sensitivity and specificity of 87.0% and 83.3%. Performance was lower for 3 doses.
   Conclusions: While overall HPV vaccination coverage remains low, it is higher in females than males, except in 9-13 year-olds. There have been increases in coverage among many age groups, but coverage has stalled in younger females. Adequate validity was demonstrated for self/parent-reported vaccination of >= 1 dose, but not 3 doses, in a pilot study. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background: Recombinant subunit vaccines have been extensively evaluated as promising alternatives against leptospirosis. Here, we evaluated two proteins in formulations containing the adjuvant AddaVax (TM) w as vaccine candidates for prevention and control of leptospirosis.
   Methods: Recombinant proteins rErp Y-like and rLemA were characterized by ELISA to assess their ability to bind extracellular matrix (ECM) components and fibrinogen. Groups of eight hamsters were immunized intramuscularly with rErp Y-like or rLemA mixed with a squalene-based adjuvant (AddaVax), and then vaccine efficacy was determined in terms of protection against a lethal challenge. The humoral immune response was determined by ELISA, and the evidence of sub-lethal infection was evaluated by histopathology and kidney culture.
   Results: rLemA protein binds laminin, fibrinogen, and collagen type IV, while rErp Y-like interacts with fibrinogen. Significant protection was achieved for rLemA and rErp Y-like vaccines, which showed 87.5% and 62.5% survivals, respectively. On day 28, the humoral immune response was significantly greater in the vaccine groups as compared to that in the control group, and the response was predominantly based on IgG2/3. The surviving animals showed negative results in culture isolation but presented with tissue lesions in the lungs and kidneys.
   Conclusion: Cumulatively, our findings suggest that LemA and Erp Y-like proteins act as adhesins and are able to protect against mortality, but not against tissue lesions. Moreover, AddaVax is a novel adjuvant with potential for improving the immunogenicity of leptospiral vaccines. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background: Since the introduction of mumps-containing vaccines (MuCV) in 1995 in Beijing, two-dose MuCV vaccination policy has been used, with the 1st and 2nd doses given at 18 months and 6 years of age, respectively.
   Methods: Mumps epidemiology during 2005-2016 was described using surveillance data. Vaccine effectiveness (VE) of MuCV against disease was estimated for cases born during 2002-2009 and reported in 2016. VE against complications was estimated for all cases. MuCV coverage was estimated for children born during 1999-2015 using data from Beijing Immunization Information System.
   Results: Overall mumps incidence decreased from 30.38/100,000 persons in 2005 to 10.26/100,000 persons in 2016. Incidence declines in children aged <15 years. No significant incidence change occurred in adults aged >= 20 years. Incidence in persons aged 15-19 years increased by 132.73% in 2012 when compared with in 2005. Rates of meningitis/encephalitis, orchitis, and other complications among cases decreased during 2005-2016. The majority (97%) of outbreaks occurred in schools. Total number of outbreaks and average outbreak size decreased during 2005-2016. Among outbreak-related cases, 69.54%, 29.67% and 0.79% had received 0 dose, ldose and 2 doses of MuCV, respectively. Coverage of the 1st MuCV dose at 2-5 years of age increased by 42.75% during 2005-2016. Coverage of the 2nd MuCV dose at 6-14 years of age increased by 12.87% during 2013-2016. Overall VE estimates of MuCV against mumps disease were 74.51% (95% CI: 65.57-81.34%) for 1 dose and 83.16% (95% CI: 78.60-86.31%) for 2 doses. Both VE estimates increased by birth cohorts. VE estimate against complications for 2-dose MuCV was higher than for 1 dose.
   Conclusions: Increasing MuCV coverage achieved declining mumps incidence and complication rate. Current epidemiology supported 2-dose MuCV vaccination policy. The incidence rise in persons aged 15-19 years in 2012 and waning immunity for the 2nd MuCV dose merited close follow-up. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In 2014 the Australian immunisation target was raised from 90% to 95% of children to be fully immunised. A national priority is to identify geographic areas of low coverage and implement strategies to improve immunisation rates. Using The World Health Organization's Tailoring Immunization Programmes (TIP) Guidelines, the aim of this study was to identify areas of low immunisation coverage for children in the Hunter New England Local Health District, New South Wales, and to gain a deeper understanding of the factors influencing immunisation in those areas in order to develop tailored strategies for increasing immunisation coverage. Data from the Australian Immunisation Register was used to identify geographic areas of low coverage. Data from interviews and focus groups with parents and service providers were used to gain a deeper understanding of the factors influencing immunisation in those areas. The regional city of Maitland in New South Wales was identified as having a persistently high number and relatively high proportion of children not fully immunised (n = 427, 15.4% in 2016). Themes from 59 stakeholder interviews and focus groups included; (i) limited engagement with health services unless the need is urgent, (ii) multi-dimensional access barriers to immunisation services in Maitland, (iii) a flexible, supportive family centred, primary health care approach, utilising strong partnerships, is most likely to be effective in increasing childhood immunisation rates in Maitland, (iv) data can be used more effectively to inform service providers about trends and individual children not fully immunised. TIP guidelines proved useful for identifying areas of low coverage and providing an understanding of determining factors and the strategies most likely to be effective. Understanding the complex problems many parents face and the access barriers that contribute to low immunisation coverage is essential in developing appropriate solutions. Finding ways to support parents and remove those barriers can contribute to higher coverage. In Maitland, targeted outreach and home visiting has been implemented in consultation with community and health service representatives to ensure that the children from socially disadvantaged populations identified do not miss out on vaccination.

TI Safety of a two-dose investigational hepatitis B vaccine, HBsAg-1018,
   using a toll-like receptor 9 agonist adjuvant in adults
SO VACCINE

ID HEART-ASSOCIATION; IMMUNOGENICITY; RISK; AGE
AB Background: Hepatitis B virus infection remains an important global public health problem. Approved alum-adjuvanted vaccines are well tolerated but require three doses and have reduced immunogenicity in adults. A two-dose vaccine containing hepatitis B surface antigen combined with a novel, Toll-like receptor 9 agonist adjuvant (HBsAg-1018 [HEPLISAV-B (R)]) has demonstrated significantly higher seroprotection rates than a three dose vaccine.
   Methods: A post hoc analysis compared the safety of HBsAg-1018 with HBsAg-Eng (Engerix-e), in three randomized, observer-blinded, active-controlled, multi-center phase 3 trials in adults. HBsAg-1018 was administered intramuscularly at weeks 0 and 4 and placebo at week 24 and HBsAg-Eng at weeks 0, 4, and 24.
   Results: Post-injection reactions, adverse events, medically attended adverse events, and new-onset immune-mediated adverse events were balanced between vaccine groups. Anti-nuclear antibodies, anti-double stranded DNA antibodies, anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies, and antiphospholipid antibodies were balanced between groups. A transient increase in anti-beta2 glycoprotein 1 IgM was observed in the HBsAg-1018 group but was not associated with a thrombotic event. Serious adverse events and deaths were generally balanced between groups.
   Conclusion: HBsAg-1018 had a similar safety profile to HBsAg-Eng. With improved immunogenicity and fewer doses over a shorter time, HBsAg-1018 has the potential to provide improved seroprotection and a significant public health benefit to adults 18 years of age or older.

AB uPA, a trypsin-like serine protease, was found to take active part in male reproduction. Our previous work had demonstrated the antifertility effects of its full length protein immunization, but with immune tolerance and other latent side effects. Here we discovered two effective B-cell epitopes of uPA for male contraception in growth factor-like domain and kringle domain respectively. Together with carrier protein, immunization of these two epitope peptides could induce high titers of specific antibodies in male mice. Significant reduction of fertility was observed in these two groups in mating trial without evident systemic illness or abnormal mating behavior. Epididymal sperms of immunized males exhibited impaired progressive motility and ability to fertilize eggs in vitro. The immunization of another predicted epitope in serine protease domain and the control groups showed no similar positive results. Importantly, T cells were not activated after the challenge of these B-cell epitopes itself, which suggests that these vaccines do not induce cell-mediated autoimmunity. Taken together, our study discovered two uPA B-cell epitopes as novel targets for male immunocontraception with minimum side effects. Considering their high identity with human uPA protein, these two epitope vaccines hold great promise to be developed for man use in the future. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Tuberculosis (TB) remains a major cause of mortality and morbidity worldwide, yet current control strategies, including the existing BCG vaccine, have had little impact on disease control. CysVac2, a fusion protein comprising stage-specific Mycobacterium tuberculosis antigens, provided superior protective efficacy against chronic M. tuberculosis infection in mice, compared to BCG. To determine if the delivery of CysVac2 in the context of BCG could improve BCG-induced immunity and protection, we generated a recombinant strain of BCG overexpressing CysVac2 (rBCG:CysVac2). Expression of CysVac2 in BCG was facilitated by the M. tuberculosis hspX promoter, which is highly induced inside phagocytic cells and induces strong cellular immune responses to antigens expressed under its regulation. Intradermal vaccination with rBCG:CysVac2 resulted in increased monocyte/macrophage recruitment and enhanced antigen-specific CD4(+) T cell priming compared to parental BCG, indicating CysVac2 overexpression had a marked effect on rBCG induced-immunity. Further, rBCG:CysVac2 was a more potent inducer of antigen-specific multifunctional CD4(+)T cells (CD4(+)IFN-gamma+TNF+IL-2(+)) than BCG after vaccination of mice. This improved immunogenicity however did not influence protective efficacy, with both BCG and rBCG: CysVac2 affording comparable level of protection aerosol infection with M. tuberculosis. Boosting either BCG or rBCG:CysVac2 with the CysVac2 fusion protein resulted in a similar improvement in protective efficacy. These results demonstrate that the expression of protective antigens in BCG can augment antigen-specific immunity after vaccination but does not alter protection against infection, further highlighting the challenge of developing effective vaccines to control TB.

AB Avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) is one of the most important viral diseases of poultry. The mucosa of upper respiratory tract, specially the trachea, is the primary replication site for this virus. However, conventional inactivate IBV vaccines usually elicit reduced mucosal immune responses and local protection. Thus, an inactivated IBV vaccine containing BR-I genotype strain encapsulated in chitosan nanoparticles (IBV-CS) was produced by ionic gelation method to be administered by oculo-nasal route to chickens. IBV-CS vaccine administered alone resulted in markedly mucosal immune responses, characterized by high levels of anti-IBV IgA isotype antibodies and IFN gamma gene expression at 1 dpi. The association of live attenuated Massachusetts IBV and IBV-CS vaccine also induced strong mucosal immune responses, though a switch from IgA isotype to IgG was observed, and IFN gamma gene expression peak was late (at 5 dpi). Efficacy of IBV-CS was evaluated by tracheal ciliostasis analysis, histopathology examination, and viral load determination in the trachea and kidney. The results indicated that IBV-CS vaccine administered alone or associated with a live attenuated heterologous vaccine induced both humoral and cell-mediated immune responses at the primary site of viral replication, and provided an effective protection against IBV infection at local (trachea) and systemic (kidney) sites.

AB Background: Despite increasing awareness of the importance of a provider recommendation for HPV vaccine, the U.S. has yet to achieve the Healthy people 2020 goal of 80% series completion among adolescents. This failure indicates a need for further examination of the modifiable influences on parents' decision-making. Healthcare providers can influence parents' HPV vaccination decision-making, but little is known about parents' perspectives on the counseling they receive. We sought to assess U.S. parents' satisfaction with provider communication about HPV vaccine and associations with vaccination behaviors.
   Methods: Parents of 11-to-17-year-old adolescents who discussed HPV vaccination with a healthcare provider at least once (n = 795) completed our online survey in Fall 2016. We assessed their satisfaction with the discussion using the HPV Vaccine Communication Satisfaction Scale (alpha = 0.94). We examined associations between satisfaction (categorized as low, moderate, or high), and three vaccination behaviors: refusal/delay, series initiation (>= 1 dose), and continuation (>= 2 doses among initiators) using multivariable logistic regression.
   Results: Most parents reported high (36%) or moderate (38%) satisfaction with provider communication about HPV vaccination; fewer reported low (26%) satisfaction. Moderately satisfied parents (vs. low) had lower odds of refusal delay (aOR = 0.59, 95% CI: 0.38-0.89), and higher odds of initiation (aOR = 1.71, 95% CI:1.15-2.55) and continuation (aOR = 2.05, 95% CI: 1.24-3.40). The associations were stronger for highly satisfied parents (refusal/delay aOR = 0.45, 95% CI: 0.29-0.70, initiation aOR = 3.59, 95% CI: 2.23-5.78, and continuation aOR = 4.08, 95% CI: 2.38-7.01).
   Conclusions: Our study suggests that parent satisfaction with provider communication may play an important role in HPV vaccination decision-making. Yet, communication satisfaction has been largely unexamined in the HPV-vaccine literature to date. We introduce a brief, 7-item HPV Vaccine Communication Scale that can be used to assess parents' level of satisfaction with their provider's communication specific to HPV vaccine. We identify communication areas for providers to prioritize when discussing HPV vaccine with parents. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Predicting antigens that would be protective is crucial for the development of recombinant vaccine using genome based vaccine development, also known as reverse vaccinology. High-throughput antigen screening is effective for identifying vaccine target genes, particularly for pathogens for which minimal antigenicity data exist. Using red sea bream iridovirus (RSIV) as a research model, we developed enzyme-linked immune sorbent assay (ELISA) based RSIV-derived 72 recombinant antigen array to profile antiviral antibody responses in convalescent Japanese amberjack (Seriola quinqueradiata). Two and three genes for which the products were unrecognized and recognized, respectively, by antibodies in convalescent serum were selected for recombinant vaccine preparation, and the protective effect was examined in infection tests using Japanese amberjack and greater amberjack (S. dumerili). No protection was provided by vaccines prepared from gene products unrecognized by convalescent serum antibodies. By contrast, two vaccines prepared from gene products recognized by serum antibodies induced protective immunity in both fish species. These results indicate that ELISA array screening is effective for identifying antigens that induce protective immune responses. As this method does not require culturing of pathogens, it is also suitable for identifying protective antigens to un-culturable etiologic agents. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID PDR; BIRTH
AB Background: Routine vaccination is administered free of charge to all children under one year old in Lao People's Democratic Republic (Lao PDR) and the national goal is to achieve at least 95% coverage with all vaccines included in the national immunization program by 2025. In this study, factors related to the immunization system and characteristics of provinces and districts in Lao PDR were examined to evaluate the association with routine immunization coverage.
   Methods: Coverage rates for Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG), Diphtheria-Tetanus-Pertussis-Hepatitis B (DTP-HepB), DTP-HepB-Hib (Haemophilus influenzae type B), polio (OPV), and measles (MCV1) vaccines from 2002 to 2014 collected through regular reporting system, were used to identify the immunization coverage trends in Lao PDR. Correlation analysis was performed using immunization coverage, characteristics of provinces or districts (population, population density, and proportion of poor villages and high-risk villages), and factors related to immunization service (including the proportions of the following: villages served by health facility levels, vaccine session types, and presence of well-functioning cold chain equipment). To determine factors associated with low coverage, provinces were categorized based on 80% of DTP-HepB-Hib3 coverage (<80% = low group; >= 80% = high group).
   Results: Coverages of BCG, DTP-HepB3, OPV3 and MCV1 increased gradually from 2007 to 2014 (82.28-8.3% in 2014). However, BCG coverage showed the least improvement from 2002 to 2014. The coverage of each vaccine correlated with the coverage of the other vaccines and DTP-HepB-Hib dropout rate in provinces as well as districts. The provinces with low immunization coverage were correlated with higher proportions of poor villages.
   Conclusions: Routine immunization coverage has been improving in the last 13 years, but the national goal is not yet reached in Lao PDR. The results of this study suggest that BCG coverage and poor villages should be targeted to improve nationwide coverage. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

DE Older adults; Influenza vaccination; Knowledge; Attitudes; China
ID PERCEPTIONS; POPULATION; PEOPLE
AB Background: This study aims to assess the association between socio-demographic and health characteristics of older adults in Eastern China and knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) about the influenza virus and vaccine.
   Methods: A prospective cohort of 1506 older adults (aged >= 60 years) was enrolled from November to December 2015 in Jiangsu Province. We examined the association between demographics, health and functional status, and cognitive impairment at enrollment with awareness of influenza virus and vaccine and KAP items focused on five Health Belief Model domains. At a 12-month follow-up interview we assessed change in awareness and readiness to be vaccinated.
   Results: One in five older adults was aware of the influenza virus (21%) or vaccine (20%); even fewer reported having at least "a little" knowledge of the virus and vaccine (7% and 4%, respectively); less than 1% reported ever receiving an influenza vaccine. Retirement, higher education and income, and normal cognitive status were consistently associated with both awareness and knowledge of influenza virus. The odds of having at least "a little" knowledge of the vaccine was 2.9-fold (95% CI = 1.6-5.3) higher among older adults with at least some secondary schooling. Among the 108 with knowledge of the virus, 55% said they "worry about getting the flu this season." Among the 73 with knowledge of the vaccine, 92% believed the vaccine was at least somewhat effective and less than half (43%) thought that influenza vaccination was safe. At a 12-month follow-up interview, 33% (442/1333) increased from no knowledge to at least "a little".
   Conclusions: If and when influenza vaccines become widely available to older adults in China, our results indicate that influenza vaccination campaigns with basic information on the virus and vaccine could be beneficial for all older adults, especially those with less education and/or more cognitive impairment.

AB Background: In Flanders, Belgium, pertussis vaccination is recommended since 2013 and available free-of-charge in every pregnancy between 24 and 32 weeks of gestation. Influenza vaccination is recommended for more than 10 years with a co-payment system in the second or third trimester of pregnancy, when pregnancy coincides with the influenza season. This study aims to estimate the coverage of pertussis and influenza vaccination during pregnancy in 2016 and to determine predictors for missing vaccination.
   Methods: Postpartum women were visited at home for a vaccination coverage survey using an Expanded Program on Immunization (EPI)-based two-stage cluster sampling design. Predictors for missed vaccination were identified using a multiple logistic regression model.
   Results: Among 481 participating women, 69.3% were vaccinated against pertussis and 47.2% were vaccinated against influenza. Moreover, 65.3% of pertussis vaccine recipients and 96.9% of influenza vaccine recipients were vaccinated within the recommended gestational window.
   Surprisingly, among women who were completely informed (i.e. on disease-associated risks, maternal vaccination costs and recommendations), still 12.4% were unvaccinated against pertussis and 23.9% against influenza.
   In the final models, the only common predictor of missing maternal pertussis and influenza vaccination was multiparity. Significant predictors of maternal pertussis vaccination were family income (less likely if unknown or low (< (sic)3000) than if moderate ((sic)3001-(sic)4000)) and hospital of delivery (less likely if >800 annual deliveries than <800). Significant predictors of maternal influenza vaccination, though with less straight-forward associations, were maternal ethnicity and educational level, involvement of a gynaecologist in pregnancy follow-up, and characteristics of the hospital of delivery.
   Conclusion: In Flanders, more than two-third of pregnant women receives pertussis vaccination but less than half of them receives the influenza vaccine. Further improvement for both maternal vaccination programs can be achieved by targeting the underserved populations and diminishing vaccination hurdles. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The risk of spread of African swine fever virus (ASFV) from Russia and Caucasian areas to several EU countries has recently emerged, making it imperative to improve our knowledge and defensive tools against this important pathogen. The ASFV genome encodes many genes which are not essential for virus replication but are known to control host immune evasion, such as NFxB and the NFAT regulator A238L, the apoptosis inhibitor A224L, the MHC-I antigen presenting modulator EP153R, and the A276R gene, involved in modulating type I IFN. These genes are hypothesized to be involved in virulence of the genotype I parental ASFV NH/P68. We here describe the generation of putative live attenuated vaccines (LAV) prototypes by constructing recombinant NH/P68 viruses lacking these specific genes and containing specific markers.

AB Background: Current Human papillomavirus (HPV) L1 VLP vaccines protect against HPV-16 and HPV-18-associated cancers, in females and males. Although correlates of protection have not been identified, HPV-specific antibodies at sites of infection are thought to be the main mechanism of protection afforded by vaccination. Oral sampling has gained increased attention as a potential alternative to serum in monitoring immunity to vaccination and understanding local immunity in oral cancers.
   Methods: Serum was collected via venipuncture, and saliva was collected via oral rinses and Merocel (R) sponges from healthy volunteers: 16 unvaccinated females, 6 females (ages 24-41) and 6 mid-adult aged males (ages 27-45) recipients of three doses of the HPV-16/18/6/11 vaccine (Gardasil (R)). Mid-adult male vaccine trial participants were compared to female participants. Samples were tested for anti-HPV-16 and anti-HPV-18 immunoglobulin G levels by an Ll virus-like particle-based enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).
   Results: All vaccinated participants had detectable serum anti-HPV-16 and anti-HPV-18 antibodies. Optimal standard concentration range and sample serial dilutions for oral rinses were determined. The standard curve was not affected by the type of solution examined. Reproducibility of HPV-16 and HPV-18 antibody titers in mouthwash (overall CV < 10%) or in Merocel (R) extraction buffer was robust (CV < 13%). Excellent assay linearity (R-2 > 0.9) was observed for sera spiked controls in both solutions. HPV-16 and HPV-18 specific antibodies were detectable in saliva from vaccine recipients, both in mouthwash and in Merocel (R) sponges but levels were several logs lower than those in serum.
   Conclusions: This study confirms the application of HPV-16 and HPV-18 ELISAs currently used in seroepidemiological studies of immunogenicity of HPV vaccines for use with oral samples. Oral samples may be a useful resource for the detection of HPV-16 and HPV-18-specific antibodies in saliva following vaccination.

AB Since preexisting immunity and enhanced infection rates in a clinical trial of an HIV vaccine have raised some concerns on adenovirus (Ad) serotype 5-based vaccines, we evaluated the subgroup D adenovirus serotype Ad19a for its suitability as novel viral vector vaccine against mucosal infections. In BALB/c mice, we compared the immunogenicity and efficacy of E1/E3-deleted Ad19a vectors encoding the influenza A virus (IAV)-derived antigens hemagglutinin (HA) and nucleoprotein (NP) to the most commonly used Ad5 vectors. The adenoviral vectors were applied intranasally and induced detectable antigen-specific T cell responses in the lung and in the spleen as well as robust antibody responses. A prior DNA immunization significantly improved the immunogenicity of both vectors and resulted in full protection against a lethal infection with a heterologous H3N2 virus. Nevertheless, the Ad5-based vectors were slightly superior in reducing viral replication in the lung which corresponded to higher NP-specific T cell responses measured in the lungs.

AB Background: Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is highly endemic in the Colombian Amazon basin. In Colombia, the universal hepatitis B vaccination in that area has been active since 1993. The program targets children aged under five years. Newborns receive at least three doses, and in 2001, HBV vaccine birth dose was included. This study aimed to evaluate the advances on HBV control in the Colombian Amazon.
   Methods: A population-based cross-sectional study was conducted in children less than 11 years old in rural areas of the Colombian Amazon, in order to assess the current levels of HBV prevalence and evaluate the effectiveness of HBV vaccination. Participants were selected from villages scattered along the Amazon, Putumayo and Loretoyaco Rivers. Blood samples were taken from children. All the samples were examined for surface antigen (HBsAg) and IgG antibodies against core antigen (AntiHBc) of HBV. Data on HBV vaccination status and other risk factors were also collected.
   Results: Blood samples from 1275 children were included in the study. The positivity for IgG AntiHBC and HBsAg was 3.8% and 0.5%, respectively. It was observed that receiving a dose of HBV vaccine within 48 h after birth decreased the risk of HBV infection and carriage by 95%. Being born to an AntiHBc positive mother increased 8 times the risk of HBV infection (OR = 7.8 CI 95% 3.3-10.2) and 7 times the risk of HBsAg carriage (OR = 6.6 CI 95% 2.1-10.1).
   Conclusion: The prevalence of HBV infection and HBsAg carriage continues to decrease among children living in the Colombian Amazon. The high protective effectiveness of an HBV birth does suggest that perinatal transmission is important in endemic areas of Latin America, an aspect that has not been fully studied in the region.

AB Objectives: To estimate the trend in incidence of rotavirus gastroenteritis (RVGE) hospitalization among children aged <5 years in Japan during pre- and post-vaccine periods (2009-2011 and 2012-2015).
   Study design: This retrospective observational study used a health insurance claims database (constructed by Japan Medical Data Center Co., Ltd.). Rotavirus vaccine became commercially available in 2011. We analyzed data of all children aged <5 years between January 2009 and December 2015. We estimated the incidence rate (IR) of RVGE hospitalization per 1000 person-years from 2009 to 2015 and incidence rate ratio (IRR) of post-vaccine years compared with the averaged pre-vaccine years. IRs and IRRs were also estimated by age group. Primary analysis was limited to the rotavirus season (January to June) of each year.
   Results: The IR was 6.3-9.3 in pre-vaccine years, 2.3 in 2014, and 3.0 in 2015; the decline was estimated to be 71% in 2014 and 61% in 2015 (p < 0.01). By age group, reduction in hospitalizations began in 2013 among children <1 year old, followed by children aged 1 to <5 years in 2014. In the 2014 season, a 65% reduction in RVGE hospitalization was observed in children aged 36 to <60 months, although this age group was unlikely to be vaccinated.
   Conclusions: A substantial decline of RVGE hospitalization in 2014 and its persistence was observed among children aged <5 years in Japan after introduction of rotavirus vaccine, although not included in the national immunization program. Indirect effects of rotavirus vaccination were suggested in the 2014 season. (C) 2017 Merck Sharp & Dohme Corp and The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Background: Following the H1N1 influenza pandemic in 2009, pregnant women were recommended to receive both seasonal (TIV) and H1N1 influenza vaccines. This study presents incidence of adverse birth and pregnancy outcomes among a population of pregnant women immunized with TIV and H1N1 vaccines at Kaiser Permanente Northern California during 2009-2010.
   Methods: We telephone surveyed pregnant Kaiser Permanente Northern California members to assess non-medically-attended reactions following H1N1, TIV or both vaccines during 2009-2010 (n = 5365) in a separate study. Here we assessed preterm birth (<37 weeks), very preterm birth (<32 weeks), low birth weight (<2500 g, LBW), very low birth weight (<1500 g), small for gestational age, spontaneous abortions, stillbirths and congenital anomalies among this cohort by comparing incidence and 95% confidence intervals between the following immunization groups: TIV only, H1N1 only, H1N1 prior to TIV immunization, TIV prior to H1N1 and both immunizations given at the same time.
   Results: Results did not vary significantly between groups. Comparing H1N1 with TIV, incidence were similar for preterm births (6.37 vs 6.28/100 births), very preterm births (5.30 vs 8.29/1000 births), LBW (4.19 vs 2.90/100 births), very LBW (4.54 vs 5.52/1000 births), small for gestational age (9.99 vs 9.24/1000 births), spontaneous abortion (7.10 vs 6.83/1000 pregnancies), stillbirths (7.10 vs 4.57/1000 pregnancies), and congenital anomalies (2.66 vs 2.43/100 births).
   Conclusions: Although constrained by small sample size, complex vaccine groups, and differential vaccine availability during 2009-2010, this study found no difference in adverse birth outcomes between H1N1 vaccine and TIV. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB A novel shapestable Ca(NO3)(2)-NaNO3/expanded graphite composite phase change material (PCM) for mid- to hightemperature TES was successfully synthesized by the developed impregnation and sintering two-step method. The low-cost binary salt Ca(NO3)(2)-NaNO3 was chosen as the PCM and expanded graphite (EG) was as the structural supporting material and thermal conductivity enhancer. The results showed that the binary eutectic nitrate and EG have good chemical compatibility, and the composite with 7 wt% EG can overcome the problems of cracks or liquid leakage during the phase change. Benefiting from the established better conductive passageway within the composites, the thermal conductivity of the composite with 7 wt% EG can be significantly increased by about 7.3 times in comparison with the binary eutectic nitrate. However, the measured phase change latent heats of the shapestable phase change materials (SSPCMs) are markedly lower than the theoretical ones, meaning some losses of the latent heat during the material fabrication process. The developed SSPCM also showed little change of the phase change properties after 500 thermal cycles, indicating it has good thermal reliability for a long term period. Compared with other PCMs for mid- to hightemperature applications, this novel cost-effective composite SSPCM is very promising due to the wide operating temperature range and high thermal conductivity.

AB Supercritical CO2 (S-CO2) power cycles have received much attention due to their desired advantages in various applications. Due to the substantial difference in specific heat of S-CO2 at different pressure, unique characteristics inside heat exchangers, especially in the recuperator, are observed and affect the cycle design. In this research, the problem of inner pinch occurring inside the S-CO2 recuperator is identified and resolved by suggesting a new framework for the definition of heat exchanger effectiveness using the point of zero inner pinch. The design methodology of S-CO2 cycles is improved using this definition by developing a module to calculate the zero inner pinch using artificial neural network (ANN) to undergo a learning process. As a result, the computation time required for cycle analysis is reduced by an order of 10(3) in the case of simple recuperated Brayton cycle, under the accuracy of 10(-7) error bound. As the readers gain the access to the developed module for calculating the zero inner pinch, the procedure for S-CO2 cycle optimization will become far more manageable for researchers, and as a result, this result can allow the conceptualization of even further complex layouts in S-CO2 cycle research.

AB Thermal energy storage systems based on Phase change materials (PCM) are an attractive option to bridge the temporal and spatial gap between the energy demand and supply. But, these systems possess poor thermal conductivity causing reduced rate of heat transfer. The objective of the present study is to numerically analyze the melting process in an optimized finned latent heat storage system dispersed with varying volume fraction of Graphene nano plates (GNP). The individual effect of incorporating fins, GNP and a combination of both at different volume fraction has been studied. Effective thermal conductivity of nano-composite PCM has been theoretically evaluated including the effect of aspect ratio, interfacial thermal resistance, anisotropy, non-linear effects as well as concentration for the dispersed GNP. In this work, Dynamic differential scanning calorimetry tests are performed to evaluate the phase change temperature, latent heat and specific heat of the sugar alcohol (d- mannitol). Transient variation of liquid fraction, average temperature and radial/longitudinal temperature differentials are presented which would be useful for designing medium temperature (160-200 degrees C) storage systems for various applications. Fin height is varied to obtain an optimum fin size such that natural convection currents are not impeded. Various heat transfer models (including natural convection) are analysed using the actual plant data of a double effect solar absorption system at different arrangements of fins and GNP. Effect of Reynolds number and inlet temperature of HTF on the system performance have also been studied. A reduction of 68% in total melting time is observed in finned LHSS with 5% GNP as compared to a conventional system.

AB Wind speed forecasting plays a crucial role in power system operations, power grid security management, and in the electricity market. This is of great significance for society and is still a challenging task. However, most previous studies were based on simple data preprocessing and they only focused on improving either the forecasting accuracy or stability while ignoring the significance of improving these two aspects simultaneously, which will lead to poor forecasting performance. Therefore, a hybrid forecasting system based on a newly developed algorithm proposed herein referred to as the multi-objective sine cosine algorithm (MOSCA)-is developed, which includes four modules, specifically, data preprocessing, optimization, forecasting, and evaluation module. For this system, a modified data decomposition approach is successfully developed to further improve its forecasting performance. In addition, a hybrid wavelet neutral network (WNN) based on MOSCA is developed to obtain high accuracy and strong stability simultaneously. Case studies utilizing eight wind speed datasets collected from two wind farms are performed as examples to analyze the performance of the developed forecasting system. The results clearly reveal that the developed forecasting system is superior to all the considered models herein in terms of both accuracy and stability. As a result, it is concluded that the proposed approach can be an efficient and effective technique for wind speed forecasting.

AB Piezoelectric energy harvesting from vehicle-pbridge coupling vibration is tested in this work. Firstly, a vehicle bridge coupling platform is introduced, and the dynamic response of the bridge is measured and analyzed. Based on the vibration characteristics of the coupling platform, two piezoelectric energy harvesters (PEHs) with different fundamental frequencies are designed and manufactured, denoted as PEH-1 (designed with the natural frequency of the bridge) and PEH-2 (designed with the frequency of vehicle-pbridge coupling vibration). The electromechanical characteristics of the PEHs are tested experimentally. Then, the voltage outputs of the PEHs are measured under nine different cases and the energy harvesting performance of the PEHs are discussed. Finally, the influences of the resistance load on energy harvesting are analyzed theoretically. Experimental results show that the voltage output of PEH-1 has its peaks when the vehicle enters into or leaves the bridge, and is almost zero when the vehicle moves on the bridge. The voltage output of PEH-2, by contrast, is still obvious when the vehicle moves on the bridge. The experimental results also show that more energy can be harvested when the PEHs are installed at the middle of bridge. An interesting result is found. The harvested energy is different even if the PEHs are installed at two symmetric positions of the bridge.

AB The purpose of the present study is to investigate the thermal performance of a photovoltaic/thermal system, integrated with phase change materials in porous medium. For this purpose, a metal foam was employed as porous medium and the performance of five different PCMs, as organic and inorganic, were examined as well. Moreover, the effects of different key parameters such as the mass flow rate, solar irradiance, inlet water temperature and inclination were studied. Finally, the simulation results were compared with a water-cooled photovoltaic/thermal without incorporating PCMs and porous medium, and thermal performance of the three PV/T cases were reported. The highest thermal efficiency of the system was reported as 83% in case of 0.02 kg s(-1) mass flow rate and using Paraffin C22 as the storage material. In addition, the incorporation of porous medium resulted in better temperature distribution, and the porosity of 0.8 was resulted in higher thermal performance. Furthermore, the results were validated with an experimental study, and good agreement was reported. At last, the exergy analysis was applied on the system, and the results showed that the exergy efficiency of the PV/T module with metal foam filled with PCM was 16.7%.

AB In the present research, multi-objective optimization (MOO) was applied to a natural gas-to-liquids (GTL) process with a multi-stage Fischer-Tropsch (FT) reactor. A CO2 stream was fed into the GTL plant's endothermic steam reformer (SMR) to adjust the H-2 to CO ratio of the SMR effluent. Three objective functions were considered in this paper; minimizing the amount of CO2 released to the atmosphere, maximizing carbon efficiency, and maximizing wax production. The degrees of freedom for the GTL process with single-stage FT reactor were recycle ratio to process and recycle ratio to the FT reactor. In addition, for the GTL process with two-stage FT reactor, the synthesis gas split ratio between the stages was considered as another degree of freedom. Maximizing wax production rate results in lower carbon efficiency and higher CO2 emission to the atmosphere. The amount of CO2 intake to the SMR in all cases was 256 tons/hr.
   With the same amount of utilized CO2 in the SMR, sectioning of the FT reactor to two similar stages notably increases the carbon efficiency and mass flow of wax compared to the single stage case.

AB As an advanced battery thermal management method, phase change material (PCM) cooling technology is highly desirable but remains significant challenges, considering the instability of the PCM module, including PCM leakage, volume changes and inhomogeneity of the whole module during the repeated melting/solidifying processes. Herein, we develop a kind of nanosilica (NS)-enhanced composite PCM (CPCM-NS) with outstanding anti-leakage and anti-volume-change performances for power battery thermal management. The NS presents numerous nanoscale pores ranging from 30 to 100 nm, which can adsorb liquid phase paraffin (PA) intensively, thus preventing the migration and leakage of liquid PA, increasing the homogeneity and reliving the volume change phenomenon of the module to a great extent. As a result, these enhanced properties of CPCM-NS endow the obtained battery module with much better cooling efficiency and durability. For instance, the maximum temperatures of CPCM-NS with 5.5 wt% of NS are 1.6, 2.4, 4.5, 5.3 and 5.9 degrees C lower than those of CPCM without NS at the 1st, 2nd, 4th, 6th and 8th cycle charge/discharge cycle, respectively, and this temperature difference remains stable at 6.22 +/- 0.05 degrees C during the subsequent cycles.

AB Micro combined heat and power (CHP) systems based on flame fuel cells (FFCs) are promising technologies for residential applications due to their simple setup and rapid startup. A dynamic model was developed in this paper for a micro FFC-based CHP system which consists of an FFC and a heat exchanger. At first, the operation conditions at the design point (system AC power output is 1.1 kW) and the part-load point (system AC power output is 0.7 kW) were determined respectively at steady state. An exergy assessment was conducted for each component and the whole system. It is found that at the design point, the heat exchanger accounts for the majority of the exergy losses. Then, the transient responses of the system components as well as the electrical and heat dynamics of the whole system were investigated when the operation conditions of the system ramped from the values at the design point to those at the part-load point. The electrical dynamic response of the CHP system, in terms of the output AC power shows a time delay of less than 50 s, while the thermal dynamic response, in terms of the generated heat shows a time delay of 300 s. The electrical dynamic response of the system is limited by the dynamics of the gas supply process of the fuel-rich burner. The thermal settling time of the system is governed by the thermal settling time of both the SOFC stack and the heat exchanger. The relatively slow thermal response under a transient electrical demand indicates that an additional heat storage is necessary in the FFC-CHP system.

AB The key to achieve an economically more attractive concentrated solar power plant is to work at higher operating temperatures, allowing both higher power conversion efficiencies resulting in a smaller heliostat field for a given energy output, and higher temperature ranges in the storage tanks, with increased energy storage density and smaller size, hence less expensive. This fostered the development of using particle suspensions as heat transfer media. This paper presents a theoretical framework for the energy analysis of a particle-in-tube solar power plant, hybridized, with topping air-Brayton cycle turbine, and bottoming steam block. From studying the effects of essential design parameters on the energy efficiency, the heat transfer efficiency of the turbine air preheater is of paramount importance to increase the solar contribution within the hybrid concept, while the energy efficiency moreover increases by an optimum air-Brayton cycle turbine operation (mostly through the pressure ratio, less by the operating temperature). The overall efficiency of the concept varies from about 40% when using combined low and high pressure Brayton cycle turbines only, to over 48% in a fully combined air steam concept. Energy efficiency findings are in agreement with the literature data.

AB Wastewater treatment is a high energy consuming process, and its energy demand is considerably increasing due to the introduction of more restrictive standards on the quality of water effluents, that require advanced technologies for pollutant removal. Energy audits are carried out in order to improve energy efficiency of wastewater treatment plants, by introducing some measures, such as adjustments of the treatment scheme, or optimization of existing operational units. At the same time, energy recovery from wastewater treatment and its by-products is being implemented in order to reduce economic costs and environmental impact of the process. In order to assess the benefits resulting from implementation of these interventions, procedures for evaluation of energy performance of wastewater treatment plants are being developed.
   In this work, a novel method is proposed for assessing energy performance of wastewater treatment plants by coupling simple energy performance indicators with specific pollution removal efficiencies. This procedure is applied to a large database of wastewater treatment plants, in order to define some classes of energy performance depending on removal efficiency. The method is also used to analyse some Italian plants, representative of different design and management conditions. As a result, only 8.2% of around 300 plants presents the highest class of performance, considering the energy consumption related to the organic matter removal.

AB This paper aims to present a futuristic review on the potential of photovoltaic-thermal or PV/T systems in a wide spectrum for the efficient utilization of solar radiation through well engineered hybrid PV/T systems. These hybrid PV/T system based technology is just 30 years old which had gained significant attention from the researchers and academicians all over the world in a recent decade. The word PV/T is composed of [PV (photovoltaic) + T (thermal)] i.e. the simultaneous production of heat and electricity in an integrated manner thus paving the way towards improving the overall energy efficiency of the system. It is a sort of co-generation technology so that the issue of low efficiency associated with existing PV technology can be impact fully addressed. It provides an opportunity for the efficient utilizing of solar radiation which is eventually dissipated as waste heat in the PV cells causing decrease in the efficiency of the PV cells. This paper covers an extensive overview of the most recent trends and useful technologies available for thermal management in PV/T collectors in a categorical manner i.e. air based, liquid based, phase change material (PCM) based and heat pipe based along with wide range of possible applications in building, solar distillation /desalination and thermoelectric generators & heat pumps. The paper also covers economical aspects like payback period, concept of Net Present Value (NPV) and exergo-economic & enviro-economic parameters for the economic assessment of the PV/T systems. The results are being tabulated for visual understanding of the different techniques being reviewed. The paper also identifies the potential role of PV/T systems to mitigate emission challenges particularly with respect to building applications.

AB The thermodynamic performance of a novel combined heating and power system integrated with biomass partial gasification and ground source heat pump has been investigated previously, while system performances are greatly dependent on system component capacity and operation strategy. In this paper, a multi-objective optimization model of proposed integration system is presented, which considers the energetic, economic and environmental performances. The optimal parameters are mainly consists of three parts: the rated power of power generation unit, carbon conversion ratio and the temperature of warm water. Genetic algorithm is adopted to optimize the component capacity and operation strategy of proposed system. In order to demonstrate the optimal model, a case study is adopted. The optimal results show that the primary energy saving ratio, annual total cost saving ratio, carbon dioxide emission reduction ratio and performance indicator are 7.61%, 23.62%, 66.52%, 32.58%, respectively. In addition, the influences of related economic factors on proposed system performances are also analyzed. Finally, the research shows that the multi-objective optimization model provides a new way for the optimization design of the integration system.

AB For the management of wind energy, wind speed forecasting is often required. Accurate multi-step ahead wind speed forecasts make the power system be adjusted timely and properly to ensure the stable and efficient operation of power system. Currently, various techniques have been developed for multi-step ahead wind speed forecasting. However, the correlation among different forecasting steps is often neglected in current multi-step ahead wind speed forecasting approaches, and the characteristic of heteroscedasticity in wind speed forecasting errors is usually not taken into consideration. In this work, a novel multi-step ahead forecasting method based on multi-kernel learning is developed. This method considers the task correlation, which represented by the covariance of multi-step ahead forecasting tasks, as well as the heteroscedasticity of forecasting errors. The optimization is solved within the framework of variational Bayesian. Thus, a correlation aware multi-step ahead wind speed forecasting technique with heteroscedastic multi-kernel learning is designed. In this paper, the experimental results in different wind farms and different seasons prove that the regression model considering the characteristics of multi-step ahead wind speed forecasting, task correlation and heteroscedasticity, will produce more accurate forecasts than the other models as for two to six-ahead wind speed forecasting. However, it is difficult to tell which characteristic is more important from the forecasting results. So, the regression model considering both of them will be more reasonable. Moreover, the training time of the proposed model is more than 10 min but less than 20 min. Thus, two to six-step ahead wind speed forecasts can be used in some practical applications, such as the load dispatch planning and the load increment/decrement decisions.

AB Bio-oil from the fast pyrolysis of biomass can be converted to solid carbon materials, chemicals and syngas by various thermochemical conversion methods. As a first step in all of these processes, bio-oil undergoes drastic components changes due to its exposure to the elevated temperature. Understanding the effects of heating rate on bio-oil transformation during its pyrolysis is therefore crucial for effective utilization of bio-oil. In this study, a bio-oil sample produced from the fast pyrolysis of rice husk at 500 degrees C was pyrolyzed in a fixed-bed reactor at temperatures between 300 and 800 degrees C at three different heating rates: fast (approximate to 200 degrees C/s), medium (approximate to 20 degrees C/s), and slow (approximate to 0.33 degrees C/s). In addition to the quantification of coke and tar yields, the tar was characterized with an ultraviolet (UV) fluorescence spectroscopy, a gas chromatography/mass spectrometer (GC/MS) and a Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometer (FT-ICR MS). Our results indicate that slow heating rates promote polymerization of bio-oil components, particularly at low temperatures (< 500 degrees C), resulting in higher primary coke yields than that of the fast heating rates. Decomposition reaction was found to be pronounced at fast heating rates, causing decreases in the tar yields and abundance of light compounds. The increases in the yields of the secondary coke, the formations of more condensed aromatic structures and macromolecules (m/ > 500) were also promoted at fast heating rates via the more intense secondary reactions.

AB Air dehumidification is widely applied in the civilian and industrial use, however, conventional vapor compression air-conditioning system consumes substantial power. Using renewable energy in the air handling process has potential to further reduce the power consumption, meanwhile ease the carbon emission. This paper proposes a novel liquid desiccant system integrated with a concentrated photovoltaic/thermal collector for deep dehumidification. The generated electric power drives a vapor compression chiller for cooling the desiccant solution for a two-stage dehumidification, and the released heat from the collector is used for the desiccant regeneration. Simulation studies indicated the proposed system has a superior power saving ability of 55.65% comparing with the conventional one, besides the equivalent power generation efficiency reaches 8.7% in the base design condition. A comparative driven force analysis showed the two-stage dehumidification has a better match of driven force compared with the single-stage liquid desiccant dehumidification, thus leading to a reduced irreversible loss of 65.43%. Sensitivity analysis indicated that the dehumidification temperature has a decisive effect on the system performance. The exergy efficiency has a maximum value of 13% as the dehumidification temperature is 22.3 degrees C. The economic studies showed that the investment on the concentrated photovoltaic/thermal collector account for the largest share of the total initial investment, and has a significant effect on the payback period. The payback period would be reduced further if the benefit of the clean development mechanism (CDM) is considered.

AB Continuous growth of human population and industrialization has increased the energy demands all over the world and this has resulted in a number of energy related challenges including depletion of fossil fuels, environmental pollution, and shortage of electricity supply. These challenges made it imperative to develop and maximize the abundant renewable energy resources, particularly the biomass via upgrading thermochemical conversion routes such as co-pyrolysis. This review paper presents an overview of previous studies, recent advances, and future directions on co-pyrolysis of biomass and waste plastics for high-grade biofuel production particularly in China and elsewhere worldwide. This paper also discussed the advantages of the co-pyrolysis process, co-pyrolysis product yields, co-pyrolysis mechanisms of biomass with plastics, and synergistic effects between them during co-pyrolysis, as well as the effects of some operating parameters especially the biomass mixing ratio and pyrolysis temperature on co-pyrolysis yields. The result of this critical review showed that co-pyrolysis of biomass with waste plastics is more beneficial than the normal biomass pyrolysis alone, and that it is also a simple, effective, and optional solution to increase the energy security of a nation, achieve effective waste management, and reduce dependency on fossil fuels.

AB In the era of big data and networking, it is necessary to develop a secure and robust digital watermarking scheme with high computational efficiency to protect copyrights of digital works. However, most of the existing methods focus on robustness and embedding capacity, losing sight of security or requiring significant computational resources in the encryption process. This paper proposed a new digital image watermarking model based on scrambling algorithm Logistic and RSA asymmetric encryption algorithm to guarantee the security of the hidden data at the foundation of large embedding capacity, good robustness and high computational efficiency. The experiments involved applying the encryption algorithms of Logistic and RSA to the watermark image and performing the hybrid decomposition of Discrete wavelet transform (DWT) and Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) on the host image, and the watermark was embedded into the low-frequency sub-band of the host. The values of PSNR and NCC were measured to estimate the imperceptibility and robustness of the proposed watermarking scheme, and the CPU running time was recorded to measure the complexity of the proposed main algorithm in execution time. Experimental results showed the superiority of the proposed watermarking scheme. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID SCHEDULING PROBLEM; ALGORITHM; MINIMUM
AB In real-life project management, resource leveling is an important technique to ensure the effective use of resources, in which activities (a) can often be executed in alternative modes and (b) are constrained by precedence relations with minimum and maximum time lags that can be modeled using generalized precedence relations (GPRs). In addition, the values of the time lags tend to depend on activity modes. The resource leveling problem with multiple modes and mode-dependent GPRs (MRLP-GPR) is a generalization of the classic NP-hard resource leveling problem. To our knowledge, no literature exists regarding the MRLP-GPR.
   We propose several heuristics for the MRLP-GPR built upon two solution approaches: (a) a steepest descent algorithm and a fast descent algorithm that are based on a decomposition approach and (b) a hybrid estimation of distribution algorithm (EDA), which is based on an integration approach. Extensive computational experiments on a large number of benchmark instances are conducted to evaluate the proposed heuristics. A comparison of the results shows that our EDA outperforms or is competitive with three baseline heuristics (a random search algorithm and two variants of a genetic algorithm that is the best-performing metaheuristic for the single-mode resource leveling problem with GPRs). Our results can serve as a benchmark for future research. Our model and solution algorithms provide an automatic tool for the project manager's multi-mode resource leveling decision-making.

AB Firms are increasingly more integrating Enterprise Content Management (ECM) into their IT infrastructure in order to manage a growing volume of complex structured and unstructured data. These packages allow capturing, generating and delivering accurate information and contents in real time to support decision making in the whole business process. However, it is not easy to achieve the full benefits of an ECM package as this relies on a variety of indicators from the organizational and technical perspectives. This paper proposes a new expert system to monitor ECM performance. It is based on the innovative hybrid technique incorporating Fuzzy Cognitive Maps (FCM) and the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP). As these indicators are interrelated, experts' knowledge is extracted, modeled, combined and processed in the new proposed expert system. This enables managers to precisely forecast the impact of changes in control indicators on system performance through the simulation of different scenarios over time. This approach has practical impacts as managers can make informed decisions based on the analysis of the expert system and thus prevent ECM malfunctions or misuses. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB This paper investigates how social images and change detection techniques can be applied to identify the damage caused by natural disasters for disaster assessment. We propose a multi-step image matching based framework (MSIM), which takes advantages of fast clustering, near duplicate image detection and robust boundary matching for the change detection in disasters. We first model the social images by exploiting their tags and locations. After that, we propose a recursive 2-means algorithm over the new data model, and refine the near duplicate detection by local interest point-based matching over image pairs in neighboring clusters. Finally, we propose a novel boundary representation model called relative position annulus (RPA), which is robust to boundary rotation, location shift and editing operations. A new RPA matching method is proposed by extending dynamic time wrapping (DTW) from time to position annulus. We have done extensive experiments to evaluate the high effectiveness and efficiency of our approach. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB A broad-spectrum monoclonal antibody (mAb)-based indirect competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ic-ELISA) has been developed for rapidly screening zearalenone (ZEN) and its primary analogues in various samples using an easy sample preparation procedure. Primarily, a group-specific mAb, 6C2, was produced, which had IC50 values for ZEN, alpha-zearalenol, beta-zearalenol, alpha-zearalanol, beta-zearalanol and zearalanone of 114.0, 127.4, 290.4, 114.9, 205.6 and 257.1 ng L-1, respectively. The limit of detection and limit of quantitation of this method for ZEN and its five primary analogues in various matrix samples ranged from 114.2 to 812.3 ng L-1 and 237.1 to 1653.9 ng L-1, respectively. The recoveries of the above samples spiked with ZEN and its five primary analogues were in the range of 62.9-113.6%. The CVs were less than 13.2%. A good correlation (R-2 = 0.995) between the ic-ELISA results and the HPLC-MS/MS results for swine feeds supported the reliability of the developed ic-ELISA.

AB Effects of Lasiodiplodia theobromae on reactive oxygen species (ROS) production-scavenging system during L. theobromae-induced pericarp browning and disease development of harvested "Fuyan" longans were investigated. Compared with control longans, L. theobromae-inoculated longans exhibited higher pericarp browning index and fruit disease index, higher pericarp O-2(-center dot) generation rate and MDA content. Moreover, L. theobromae infection also resulted in lower contents of pericarp AsA and GSH, lower levels of pericarp DPPH radical scavenging ability and reducing power. Additionally, L. theobromae infection decreased the activities of pericarp SOD, CAT and APX from day 2 to day 5. These findings suggested that L. theobromae-induced pericarp browning and disease development of harvested longans might be due to reduction of ROS scavenging ability and increase in ROS production, which might stimulate membrane lipid peroxidation, disrupt cellular membrane structure, and cause the loss of cellular compartmentalization and disease resistance, in turn, resulting in pericarp browning and disease development.

AB Edible mushrooms are valued because of their umami taste and good nutritional values. Free amino acids, 5'-nucleotides and nucleosides were analyzed from four Nordic forest mushroom species (Lactarius camphoratus, Boletus edulis, Cantharellus cibarius, Craterellus tubaeformis) using high precision liquid chromatography analysis. To our knowledge, these taste components were studied for the first time from Craterellus tubaeformis and Lactarius camphoratus. The focus was on the umami amino acids and 5'-nucleotides. The free amino acid and 5'-nucleotide/nucleoside contents of studied species differed from each other. In all studied samples, umami amino acids were among five major free amino acids. The highest concentration of umami amino acids was on L. camphoratus whereas B. edulis had the highest content of sweet amino acids and C. cibarius had the highest content of bitter amino acids. The content of umami enhancing 5'-nucleotides were low in all studied species.

AB The quantification of protein bound Maillard reaction products (MRPs) is still a challenge in food chemistry. Protein hydrolysis is the bottleneck step: it is time consuming and the protein degradation is not always complete. In this study, the quantitation of free amino acids and Amadori products (APs) was compared to the percentage of blocked lysine by using chemometric tools. Eighty thermally treated soybean samples were analyzed by mass spectrometry to measure the concentration of free amino acids, free APs and the protein-bound markers of the Maillard reaction (furosine, Ne-(carboxymethyl)-L-lysine, Ne-(carboxyethyl)-L-lysine, total lysine). Results demonstrated that Discriminant Analysis (DA) and Correlated Component Regression (CCR) correctly estimated the percent of blocked lysine in a validation and prediction set. These findings indicate that the measure of free markers reflects the extent of protein damage in soybean samples and it suggests the possibility to obtain rapid information on the quality of the industrial processes.

AB Fragaria x ananassa Duch., popularly called strawberry, is known for its worldwide consumption and important biological activities, and these effects are related to its high concentration of anthocyanins. Pelargonidin-3-Oglucoside (P3G) is a major anthocyanin found in strawberry, and was evaluated for its anti-inflammatory action in experimental models. The effect of strawberry extract and P3G, on leukocyte migration, exudation levels and many inflammatory mediators, was therefore evaluated in an in vivo model. An in vitro study was also carried out to characterize the effect of P3G on mitogen-activated protein kinases, and on nuclear transcript factors NF-kappa B and AP-1. The results revealed that the strawberry and P3G have important anti-inflammatory proprieties, and the anti-inflammatory mechanism of P3G involves the arrest of IkB-alpha activation and reduction in JNK(MAPK) phosphorylation. The results reinforce that strawberry fruits are functional foods that can act as an adjuvant in the treatment of inflammatory conditions.

AB A novel, unique electroanalytical method was developed for the simultaneous quantification of the dyes indigo carmine (IC) and allura red (AR) in candies by coupling flow injection analysis and multiple pulse amperometry with a cathodically pretreated boron-doped diamond electrode, using 0.30 mol L-1 H2SO4 as supporting electrolyte. A dual-potential waveform was employed, causing the electrooxidation of either IC solely or IC and AR simultaneously. Thence, subtraction of current signals was used to quantify IC and AR in the concentration ranges of 70.0-1000 nmol L-1 and 40.0-770 nmol L-1, with limits of detection of 40.0 nmol L-1 and 7.0 nmol L-1, respectively. The proposed method, which permits up to 153 determinations per hour with good precision, was successfully applied in the quantification of these dyes in samples of commercial candies; their obtained contents were similar (at a 95% confidence level) to those from a comparative HPLC method.

AB Three anthocyanins were isolated from strawberry extract by high-speed counter-current chromatography, using a biphasic mixture of tert-butyl methyl ether, n-butanol, acetonitrile, water and trifluoroacetic acid (2.5:2.0:2.5:5.0: 1.0%). The anthocyanins were identified as pelargonidin-3-rutinoside, cyanidin-3-glucoside and pelargonidin-3-glucoside with purity of 95.6%, 96.2% and 99.3% respectively. Additionally, the copigmentation reaction rates between pelargonidin-3-glucoside and phenolic acids (catechin or epicatechin) at pH 1.5 and 3.6, pressure 0.1 and 500 MPa, and temperature 60 degrees C were calculated. The absorbance of pelargonidin-3-glucoside at pH 3.6, with high quantity of phenolic acids was significantly increased by high pressure. The complex of pelargonidin-3-glucoside/catechin has a binding energy of 78.64 kJ/mol at pH 3.6, and 39.13 kJ/mol at pH 1.5; pelargonidin-3-glucoside/epicatechin has a binding energy of 75.34 kJ/mol at pH 1.5 and 54.47 kJ/mol at pH 3.6. The hydrogen bond and van der Waals interaction were the main forces contributing to the structures of complex.

AB A series of gamma-[Glu]((n= 2,3,4))-Val or gamma-[Glu]((n= 2,3,4))-Met were synthesized in the presence of donor (Gln) and corresponding acceptor (Val or Met) through transpeptidation catalyzed by the glutaminase from Bacillus amyloliquefaciens. Gln in excess significantly (p <.05) improved the yield of gamma-[Glu]((n> 1))-Val/Met except for gamma-Glu-Val/Met. The Km values for transpeptidase activity to yield gamma-[Glu]((n= 0,1,2,3))-Val increased with an elevated n, but remained essentially the same irrespective of n value for gamma-[Glu]((n= 0,1,2))-Met (which were 31-44% of that for gamma-[Glu] 3-Met). The highest Km value appearing when n= 3 (gamma-[Glu](3)-Val or gamma-[Glu](3)-Met) suggested the rising difficulty for synthesis when the number of donor increases. All the gamma-[Glu](n)-Val/Met substances exhibited kokumi properties and enhanced the continuity and umami taste of soy sauce as well as the thickness, mouthfulness and umaminess of model chicken broth. These results indicate the potential of the gamma-[Glu](n)-Val and gamma-[Glu](n)-Met as food flavor enhancers.

TI Detrital zircon and igneous protolith ages of high-grade metamorphic

AB The high-grade metamorphic rocks of Sri Lanka place valuable constraints on the assembly of central parts of the Gondwana supercontinent. They are subdivided into the Wanni Complex (WC), Highland Complex (HC) and Vijayan Complex (VC), but their correlation with neighbouring Gondwana terranes is hindered by a poor understanding of the contact between the HC and WC. Laser ablation-inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) U-Pb dating of remnant zircon cores from 45 high-grade metamorphic rocks in Sri Lanka reveals two domains with different age characteristics that correlate with the HC and WC and which help constrain the location of the boundary between them. The HC is dominated by detrital zircon ages of ca. 3500-1500 Ma from garnet-biotite gneiss, garnet-cordierite-biotite gneiss, some samples of garnet-orthopyroxene-biotite gneiss and siliceous gneiss (interpreted as paragneisses) and igneous protolith ages of ca. 2000-1800 Ma from garnet-hornblende-biotite gneiss, other samples of garnet-orthopyroxene-biotite gneiss, garnet-two-pyroxene granulite, two-pyroxene granulite and charnockite (interpreted as orthogneisses). In contrast, the WC is dominated by detrital zircon ages of ca. 1100-700 Ma from paragneisses and igneous protolith ages of ca. 1100-800 Ma from orthogneisses. This clearly suggests the HC and WC have different origins, but some of our results and previous data indicate their spatial distribution does not correspond exactly to the unit boundary proposed in earlier studies using Nd model ages. Detrital zircon and igneous protolith ages in the HC suggest that sedimentary protoliths were eroded from local 2000-1800 Ma igneous rocks and an older Paleoproterozoic to Archean craton. In contrast, the WC sedimentary protoliths were mainly eroded from local late Mesoproterozoic to Neoproterozoic igneous rocks with very minor components from an older 2500-1500 Ma craton, and in the case of the WC precursor sediments there was possibly additional detritus derived from early to middle Neoproterozoic metamorphic rocks. The relic zircon core ages in the HC are comparable with those of the Trivandrum Block and Nagercoil Block of southern India. In contrast, those ages in the WC match the Achankovil Shear Zone and Southern Madurai Block of southern India. These comparisons are also supported by Th/U ratios of detrital zircon cores from paragneisses (Th/U ratios of > 0.10 for the former and not only > 0.10 but also <= 0.10 for the latter). Comparisons with the Liitzow-Holm Complex of East Antarctica indicate that the geochronological characteristics of the HC and WC broadly match those of the Skallen Group, and the Ongul and Okuiwa Groups, respectively.

AB A high-resolution lacustrine-peat record from the desert-loess transitional zone in Northern China was obtained to reconstruct Holocene environmental change in the region. AMS C-14 dates are used to provide a chronology. The results indicate that the site was a desert environment before 12.2 cal kyr BP, and was then occupied by a paleolake which started to shrink, with a wetland occurring from 6.2 to 3.0 cal kyr BP. Subsequently, the site became a seasonally water-filled depression. Based on the lithology and measurements of grain size and total organic carbon content, the climate changed from arid to humid at 12.2 cal kyr BP, and became more humid after 8.3 cal kyr BP. From 6.2 to 3.0 cal kyr BP, precipitation decreased but the climate remained at an optimum. After 3.0 cal kyr BP, the climate was dry overall but with several humid intervals. A comparison of paleoclimatic records from lacustrine and aeolian deposits from the region reveals a discrepancy about the nature of the early Holocene climate, and we conclude that this is because lacustrine sediments responded more sensitively to precipitation than aeolian deposits when the temperature was low. The environmental evolution of the region was synchronous with changes in the Asian summer monsoon (ASM), but temperature also played a key role in the early Holocene.

AB There have been large discrepancies in the proposed mechanisms accounting for the wetting trend since similar to 8.0 cal. kyr BP in the Altai Mountains and the surrounding areas. To validate or invalidate the widely reported wetting trend, we obtained a carbon isotope of cellulose (delta C-13(celluose))-recorded warm-season moisture history from a Narenxia (NRX) peat core in the southern Altai Mountains, northern Xinjiang, NW China. The delta C-13(celluose)-recorded warm-season moisture reconstruction of the NRX peat core provides a strong support to the widely reported proposition that the climate was generally dry before similar to 8.0 cal. kyr BP and was changed to a wetting trend during the past similar to 8000 years in the Altai Mountains and the surrounding areas. The wetting trend since similar to 8.0 cal. kyr BP well resembles the increasing trend of the reconnaissance drought index (RDI) that was calculated on the basis of pollen-inferred temperature and precipitation data from the same core. The resemblance implies that the wetting trend during the past similar to 8 000 years resulted from the combined effect of temperature and precipitation.

AB The origin and evolution of lakes in the Hetao Plain, northern China, were influenced by climate variation, channel migration, and human activity. We analyzed a suite of sediment cores from the region to investigate Yellow River channel migration and environmental change in this region over the Holocene. Short sediment cores show that environmental indicators changed markedly around CE 1850, a time that corresponds to flood events, when large amounts of river water accumulated in the western part of the Hetao Plain, giving rise to abundant small lakes. Multiple sediment variables (environmental proxies) from two long cores collected in the Tushenze Paleolake area show that sediments deposited between 12.0 and 9.0 cal ka BP were yellow clay, indicative of fluvial deposition and channel migration. From 9.0 to 7.5 cal ka BP, sand was deposited, reflecting a desert environment. From 7.5 to 2.2 cal ka BP, however, the sediments were blue-gray clay that represents lacustrine facies of Lake Tushenze, which owes its origin to an increase in strength of the East Asian monsoon. At about 2.2 cal ka BP, the north branch of the Yellow River was flooded, and the Tushenze Paleolake developed further. Around 2.0 cal ka BP, the paleolake shrank and eolian sedimentation was recorded. The analyzed sediment records are consistent with the written history from the region, which documents channel migration and environmental changes in the Hetao Plain over the Holocene.

AB The Gulf of Izmir (GoI) is one of the largest gulfs in the Aegean Sea, Turkey. There is a large magnetic anomaly extending in the NE-SW direction between Foca and Uzunada (Uzun Island) in the gulf. Previously, Curie Point Depth (CPD), geothermal gradient, heat-flow and radiogenic heat production maps of the onshore part of the Aegean region were constructed from the aeromagnetic data. In this study, the same maps except radiogenic heat production map are presented for the offshore part and the largest magnetic anomaly in the northern part of the gulf is focused, particularly. As a result, the thermal structure of GoI is clearly defined and according to the results of this study, CPD values were found from 7 km in the NE of Foca to 10 km through the south of the gulf. The geothermal gradient values vary between 50 and 80 degrees C/km. Maximum heat flow values around the anomaly are calculated as 200 and 215 mW/m(2) according to the thermal conductivity coefficients of 2.5 W m(-1)K(-1) and 2.7 W(-)1 K-1, respectively. Although the anomaly is located in the Izmir Gulf; CPD, geothermic gradient, heat flow anomalies are shifted through the north of Foca and Aliaga towns in the Candarli Bay. This prominent anomaly in the Gulf of Izmir is associated with the magmatics that were encountered at 969 m in the Foca-1 well although it was drilled about 2 km away from the outermost closed contour of the magnetic anomaly. The anomaly is also modeled three dimensionally (3D) in this study. In the model map, the top of the causative body is completely located in the outer part of the gulf, and is very shallow at about 0.5 km while its bottom is inclined through the west of Cigli and Menemen. From this viewpoint, it is possible to suggest that the causative body is inclined through the Foca Peninsula. However, its closed contours are in the NE direction, through the Candarli Bay. Top depth of the causative body is also calculated from the basement horizon on the seismic sections crossing this anomaly. Depth calculations are consistent in these sections and confirm the top depths from the modeling study. The basement geometry in the seismic sections also reflects the shape of 3D model geometry, and bottom depth of the magmatics is also verified by the basement depth calculations in seismic sections.

AB The Late Paleozoic Ice Age (ca. 335-260 Ma, LPIA) has long been considered as an analogy for the Cenozoic ice age since the Oligocene. The impact of astronomical forcing on the LPIA glaciation has been hampered due to the low-resolution (multi-million year scale) time framework. In the present study, high-resolution cyclostratigraphy based on magnetic susceptibility (MS), covering the Serpukhovian to late Moscovian icehouse climate, has been investigated in the Luokun section of South China. Power spectral analysis of the MS series reveals 3.44-4 m, 0.8-1.07 m, 0.3-0.32 m, and 0.17-0.19 m thick sedimentary cycles. Based on the available biostratigraphic constraints, calibrating the 3.44-4 m cycles to the 405 kyr eccentricity cycles indicates short eccentricity (136 and 100 kyr), short obliquity (34 kyr), and precession (19 and 15.9 kyr) orbital bands in addition to long eccentricity (405 kyr) band. We assigned the basal Serpukhovian and Moscovian stages in Luokun with the numerical ages from Geological Time Scale 2012 to construct two floating time scales ranging from 331.55 +/- 0.5 Ma to 323.2 +/- 0.5 Ma, and from 315.34 +/- 0.35 Ma to 310.17 +/- 0.35 Ma, respectively. The modulation of main obliquity (s(4)-s(3) term) has a main periodicity of similar to 1200 kyr. The modulation of similar to 100 kyr eccentricity (g(4)-g(3) term) shows a main periodicity of similar to 2400 kyr with subordinate periodicities of similar to 1620 and similar to 1200 kyr for the Serpukhovian, and a main periodicity of similar to 1600 kyr for the Moscovian. They may provide the geological evidence for a chaotic resonance associated with interactions between the orbits of Mars and the Earth in the Carboniferous. A duration of 7.68 +/- 0.15 Myr was estimated for the Serpukhovian Stage. Eight higher accumulation rate events due to glacioeustatic drawdown were temporally constrained, and show close correspondence to far-field and near-field reconstructions of the LPIA glaciation. Glacioeustasy was paced with 405-kyr-long eccentricity and 1.2-Myr obliquity amplitude cycles during the Serpukhovian and Moscovian stages, likely indicating the nature in the wanner icehouse world similar to that of the Oligocene to Pliocene.

AB Through parallelization, field programmable gate array (FPGA) can achieve unprecedented speeds in large-scale parallel Monte Carlo (LPMC) simulations. FPGA presents both new constraints and new opportunities for the implementations of random number generators (RNGs), which are key elements of any Monte Carlo (MC) simulation system. Using empirical and application based tests, this study evaluates all of the four RNGs used in previous FPGA based MC studies and newly proposed FPGA implementations for two well-known high-quality RNGs that are suitable for LPMC studies on FPGA. One of the newly proposed FPGA implementations: a parallel version of additive lagged Fibonacci generator (Parallel ALFG) is found to be the best among the evaluated RNGs in fulfilling the needs of LPMC simulations on FPGA.

AB We introduce a stable method for solving the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations with variable density and viscosity. Our method is stable in the sense that it does not increase the total energy of dynamics that is the sum of kinetic energy and potential energy. Instead of velocity, a new state variable is taken so that the kinetic energy is formulated by the L-2-norm of the new variable. Navier-Stokes equations are rephrased with respect to the new variable, and a stable time discretization for the rephrased equations is presented.
   Taking into consideration the incompressibility in the Marker-And-Cell (MAC) grid, we present a modified Lax-Friedrich method that is L-2 stable. Utilizing the discrete integration-by-parts in MAC grid and the modified Lax-Friedrich method, the time discretization is fully discretized. An explicit CFL condition for the stability of the full discretization is given and mathematically proved. (c) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB We present an interpolation-free diffuse interface immersed boundary method for multiphase flows with moving bodies. A single fluid formalism using the volume-of-fluid approach is adopted to handle multiple immiscible fluids which are distinguished using the volume fractions, while the rigid bodies are tracked using an analogous volume-of-solid approach that solves for the solid fractions. The solution to the fluid flow equations are carried out using a finite volume-immersed boundary method, with the latter based on a diffuse interface philosophy. In the present work, we assume that the solids are filled with a "virtual" fluid with density and viscosity equal to the largest among all fluids in the domain. The solids are assumed to be rigid and their motion is solved using Newton's second law of motion. The immersed boundary methodology constructs a modified momentum equation that reduces to the Navier-Stokes equations in the fully fluid region and recovers the no-slip boundary condition inside the solids. An implicit incremental fractional-step methodology in conjunction with a novel hybrid staggered/non-staggered approach is employed, wherein a single equation for normal momentum at the cell faces is solved everywhere in the domain, independent of the number of spatial dimensions. The scalars are all solved for at the cell centres, with the transport equations for solid and fluid volume fractions solved using a high-resolution scheme. The pressure is determined everywhere in the domain (including inside the solids) using a variable coefficient Poisson equation. The solution to momentum, pressure, solid and fluid volume fraction equations everywhere in the domain circumvents the issue of pressure and velocity interpolation, which is a source of spurious oscillations in sharp interface immersed boundary methods. A well-balanced algorithm with consistent mass/momentum transport ensures robust simulations of high density ratio flows with strong body forces. The proposed diffuse interface immersed boundary method is shown to be discretely mass-preserving while being temporally second-order accurate and exhibits nominal second-order accuracy in space. We examine the efficacy of the proposed approach through extensive numerical experiments involving one or more fluids and solids, that include two-particle sedimentation in homogeneous and stratified environment. The results from the numerical simulations show that the proposed methodology results in reduced spurious force oscillations in case of moving bodies while accurately resolving complex flow phenomena in multiphase flows with moving solids. These studies demonstrate that the proposed diffuse interface immersed boundary method, which could be related to a class of penalisation approaches, is a robust and promising alternative to computationally expensive conformal moving mesh algorithms as well as the class of sharp interface immersed boundary methods for multibody problems in multi-phase flows.

AB Accurately delineating the effects of hydrological and water quality habitat factors on the aquatic biota will significantly assist the management of water resources and restoration of river ecosystems. However, current models fail to comprehensively consider the effects of multiple habitat factors on the development of fish species. In this study, a dynamic framework for river ecosystems was set up to explore the effects of multiple habitat factors in terms of hydrology and water quality on the fish community in rivers. To achieve this the biomechanical forms of the relationships between hydrology, water quality, and aquatic organisms were determined. The developing processes of the food web without external disturbance were simulated by 208 models, constructed using Ecopath With Ecosim (EWE). These models were then used to analyze changes in biomass (Delta B) of two representative fish species, Opsariichthys bidens and Carassius auratus, which are widely distributed in Asia, and thus have attracted the attention of scholars and stakeholders, due to the consequence of habitat alteration. Results showed that the relationship between the changes in fish biomass and key habitat factors can be expressed in a unified form. T-tests for the unified form revealed that the means of the two data sets of simulated and observed Delta B for these two fish species (O. bidens and C. auratus) were equal at the significance level of 5%. Compared with other ecological dynamic models, our framework includes theories that are easy to understand and has modest requirements for assembly and scientific expertise. Moreover, this framework can objectively assess the influence of hydrological and water quality variance on aquatic biota with simpler theory and little expertise. Therefore, it is easy to be put into practice and can provide a scientific support for decisions in ecological restoration made by river administrators and stakeholders across the world.

AB The need for predictions of flow time-series persists at ungauged catchments, motivating the research goals of our study. By means of the Sacramento model, this paper explores the use of parameter transfer within homogeneous regions of similar climate and flow characteristics and makes comparisons with predictions from a priori parameters. We assessed the performance using the Nash-Sutcliffe (NS), bias, mean monthly hydrograph and flow duration curve (FDC). The study was conducted on a large dataset of 73 catchments within the eastern US. Two approaches to the parameter transferability were developed and evaluated; (i) the within homogeneous region parameter transfer using one donor catchment specific to each region, (ii) the parameter transfer disregarding the geographical limits of homogeneous regions, where one donor catchment was common to all regions. Comparisons between both parameter transfers enabled to assess the gain in performance from the parameter regionalization and its respective constraints and limitations. The parameter transfer within homogeneous regions outperformed the a priori parameters and led to a decrease in bias and increase in efficiency reaching a median NS of 0.77 and a NS of 0.85 at individual catchments. The use of FDC revealed the effect of bias on the inaccuracy of prediction from parameter transfer. In one specific region, of mountainous and forested catchments, the prediction accuracy of the parameter transfer was less satisfactory and equivalent to a priori parameters. In this region, the parameter transfer from the outsider catchment provided the best performance; less-biased with smaller uncertainty in medium flow percentiles (40%-60%). The large disparity of energy conditions explained the lack of performance from parameter transfer in this region. Besides, the subsurface stormflow is predominant and there is a likelihood of lateral preferential flow, which according to its specific properties further explained the reduced efficiency. Testing the parameter transferability using criteria of similar climate and flow characteristics at ungauged catchments and comparisons with predictions from a priori parameters are a novelty. The ultimate limitations of both approaches are recognized and recommendations are made for future research. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Traditional flood risk analysis focuses on the probability of flood events exceeding the design flood of downstream hydraulic structures while neglecting the influence of sedimentation in river channels on regional flood control systems. This work advances traditional flood risk analysis by proposing a univariate and copula-based bivariate hydrological risk framework which incorporates both flood control and sediment transport. In developing the framework, the conditional probabilities of different flood events under various extreme precipitation scenarios are estimated by exploiting the copula-based model. Moreover, a Monte Carlo-based algorithm is designed to quantify the sampling uncertainty associated with univariate and bivariate hydrological risk analyses. Two catchments located on the Loess plateau are selected as study regions: the upper catchments of the Xianyang and Huaxian stations (denoted as UCX and UCH, respectively). The univariate and bivariate return periods, risk and reliability in the context of uncertainty for the purposes of flood control and sediment transport are assessed for the study regions. The results indicate that sedimentation triggers higher risks of damaging the safety of local flood control systems compared with the event that AMF exceeds the design flood of downstream hydraulic structures in the UCX and UCH. Moreover, there is considerable sampling uncertainty affecting the univariate and bivariate hydrologic risk evaluation, which greatly challenges measures of future flood mitigation. In addition, results also confirm that the developed framework can estimate conditional probabilities associated with different flood events under various extreme precipitation scenarios aiming for flood control and sediment transport. The proposed hydrological risk framework offers a promising technical reference for flood risk analysis in sandy regions worldwide. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Urban road surface roughness is one of the most important factors in estimation of surface runoff loads caused by road-deposited sediment (RDS) wash-off and design of its control measures. However, because of a lack of experimental data to distinguish the role of surface roughness, the effects of surface roughness on RDS accumulation and release are not clear. In this study, paired asphalt and concrete road surfaces and rainfall simulation designs were used to distinguish the role of surface roughness in RDS build-up and wash-off. Our results showed that typical asphalt surfaces often have higher depression depths than typical concrete surfaces, indicating that asphalt surfaces are relatively rougher than concrete surface. Asphalt surfaces can retain a larger RDS amount, relative higher percentage of coarser particles, larger RDS wash-off loads, and lower wash-off percentage, than concrete surfaces. Surface roughness has different effects in RDS motilities with different particle sizes during rainfall runoff, and the settleable particles (44-149 mu m) were notably influenced by it. Furthermore, the first flush phenomenon tended to be greater on relatively smooth surfaces than relatively rough surfaces. Overall, surface roughness plays an important role in influencing the complete process of RDS build-up and wash-off on different road characteristics. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB The genetic algorithm (GA) was combined with the Conversion of Land Use and its Effect at Small regional extent (CLUE-S) model to obtain an optimized land use pattern for controlling non-point source (NPS) pollution. The performance of the combination was evaluated. The effect of the optimized land use pattern on the NPS pollution control was estimated by the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model and an assistant map was drawn to support the land use plan for the future. The Xiangxi River watershed was selected as the study area. Two scenarios were used to simulate the land use change. Under the historical trend scenario (Markov chain prediction), the forest area decreased by 2035.06 ha, and was mainly converted into paddy and dryland area. In contrast, under the optimized scenario (genetic algorithm (GA) prediction), up to 3370 ha of dryland area was converted into forest area. Spatially, the conversion of paddy and dryland into forest occurred mainly in the northwest and southeast of the watershed, where the slope land occupied a large proportion. The organic and inorganic phosphorus loads decreased by 3.6% and 3.7%, respectively, in the optimized scenario compared to those in the historical trend scenario. GA showed a better performance in optimized land use prediction. A comparison of the land use patterns in 2010 under the real situation and in 2020 under the optimized situation showed that Shennongjia and Shuiyuesi should convert 1201.76 ha and 1115.33 ha of dryland into forest areas, respectively, which represented the greatest changes in all regions in the watershed. The results of this study indicated that GA and the CLUE-S model can be used to optimize the land use patterns in the future and that SWAT can be used to evaluate the effect of land use optimization on non-point source pollution control. These methods may provide support for land use plan of an area. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A common assumption in phosphorus (P) load apportionment studies is that P loads in rivers consist of flow independent point source emissions (mainly from domestic and industrial origins) and flow dependent diffuse source emissions (mainly from agricultural origin). Hence, rivers dominated by point sources will exhibit highest P concentration during low-flow, when flow dilution capacity is minimal, whereas rivers dominated by diffuse sources will exhibit highest P concentration during high flow, when land-to-river hydrological connectivity is maximal. Here, we show that Soluble Reactive P (SRP) concentrations in three forested catchments free of point sources exhibited seasonal maxima during the summer low-flow period, i.e. a pattern expected in point source dominated areas. A load apportionment model (LAM) is used to show how point sources contribution may have been overestimated in previous studies, because of a biogeochemical process mimicking a point source signal. Almost twenty-two years (March 1995-September 2016) of monthly monitoring data of SRP, dissolved iron (Fe) and nitrate-N (NO3) were used to investigate the underlying mechanisms: SRP and Fe exhibited similar seasonal patterns and opposite to that of NO3. We hypothesise that Fe oxyhydroxide reductive dissolution might be the cause of SRP release during the summer period, and that NO3 might act as a redox buffer, controlling the seasonality of SRP release. We conclude that LAMS may overestimate the contribution of P point sources, especially during the summer low-flow period, when eutrophication risk is maximal. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB Urban runoff negatively impacts the receiving streams and different solutions have been proposed in literature to limit the effect of urbanization on the water balance. These solutions suggest to manage urban runoff in order to switch from a post-development river hydrograph (high peak and short duration) back again to a pre-development hydrograph (low peak and high duration). Combined sewer overflows (CSOs) represent severe pollutant sources for receiving streams due to the combination of first flush of roads and sewers and black water conveyed by combined sewer systems. Constructed wetlands for CSO treatment (CSO-CWs) are adopted with increasing frequency for reducing pollutant inputs to streams. Moreover, these systems exhibit the characteristic to behave similarly to ponds, wetlands, and bioretention systems that provide flood mitigation by decreasing the intensity of peak flows. This work aims to show the additional ecosystem service provided by CSO-CWs in term of limitation of the hydraulic impact of CSO on stream hydrograph. A mathematical model is developed to simulate the hydraulic behavior of a real case study situated in Gorla Maggiore (Italy), which includes vertical flow subsurface beds (VF) as first stage and a free water surface bed (FWS) as second stage. The model simulates the unsaturated flow within VF and the accumulation of water on the top of VF and within FWS. Results show a satisfactory lamination performance of the system for both single and up to 5 consecutive flood events, with a peak flow reduction ranging from 52.7% to 95.4%. Withdrawn of flow rate from the river in order to cope with long dry period does not significantly affect the lamination performances. The considered CSO-CW exhibits an excellent lamination efficiency also during more intense floods events, with a peak flow reduction of 86.2% for a CSO event with return period of 10 years. The flow rate frequency density function determined by the CSO-CW is more shifted towards lower values compared to untreated CSOs. These results indicate that CSO-CWs work properly in terms of reduction of CSO urbanization impact on stream hydrology. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Rainfall erosivity is an index that describes the power of rainfall to cause soil erosion and it is used around the world for assessing and predicting soil loss on agricultural lands. Erosivity can be represented in terms of both rainfall momentum and kinetic energy, both calculated per unit time and area. Contrasting results on the representativeness of these two variables are available: some authors stated that momentum and kinetic energy are practically interchangeable in soil loss estimation while other found that kinetic energy is the most suitable expression of rainfall erosivity. The direct and continuous measurements of momentum and kinetic energy by a disdrometer allow also to establish a relationship with rainfall intensity at the study site.
   At first in this paper a comparison between the momentum-rainfall intensity relationships measured at Palermo and El Teularet by an optical disdrometer is presented. For a fixed rainfall intensity the measurements showed that the rainfall momentum values measured at the two experimental sites are not coincident. However both datasets presented a threshold value of rainfall intensity over which the rainfall momentum assumes a quasi-constant value. Then the reliability of a theoretically deduced relationship, linking momentum, rainfall intensity and median volume diameter, is positively verified using measured raindrop size distributions. An analysis to assess which variable, momentum or kinetic energy per unit area and time, is the best predictor of erosivity in Italy and Spain was also carried out. This investigation highlighted that the rainfall kinetic energy per unit area and time can be substituted by rainfall momentum as index for estimating the rainfall erosivity, and this result does not depend on the site where precipitation occurs.
   Finally, rainfall intensity measurements and soil loss data collected from the bare plots equipped at Sparacia experimental area were used to verify the reliability of some rainfall erosivity indices and their ability to distinguish the type of involved soil erosion processes.

AB We used an Optimal Interpolation (OI) scheme to generate a reference crop evapotranspiration (ETo) grid, forcing meteorological variables, and their respective error variance in the Iberian Peninsula for the period 1989-2011. To perform the OI we used observational data from the Spanish Meteorological Agency (AEMET) and outputs from a physically-based climate model. To compute ETo we used five OI schemes to generate grids for the five observed climate variables necessary to compute ETo using the FAO-recommended form of the Penman-Monteith equation (FAO-PM). The granularity of the resulting grids are less sensitive to variations in the density and distribution of the observational network than those generated by other interpolation methods. This is because our implementation of the OI method uses a physically-based climate model as prior background information about the spatial distribution of the climatic variables, which is critical for under-observed regions. This provides temporal consistency in the spatial variability of the climatic fields. We also show that increases in the density and improvements in the distribution of the observational network reduces substantially the uncertainty of the climatic and EL estimates. Finally, a sensitivity analysis of observational uncertainties and network densification suggests the existence of a trade-off between quantity and quality of observations. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB Urbanization-induced landuse changes alter runoff regimes in complex ways. In this study, a detailed investigation of the urbanization impacts on runoff regimes is provided by using multiple runoff metrics and with consideration of landuse dynamics. A catchment hydrological model is modified by coupling a simplified flow routing module of the urban drainage system and landuse dynamics to improve longterm urban runoff simulations. Moreover, multivariate statistical approach is adopted to mine the spatial variations of runoff metrics so as to further identify critical impact factors of landuse changes. The Qing River catchment as a peri-urban catchment in the Beijing metropolitan area is selected as our study region. Results show that: (1) the dryland agriculture is decreased from 13.9% to 1.5% of the total catchment area in the years 2000-2015, while the percentages of impervious surface, forest and grass are increased from 63.5% to 72.4%, 13.5% to 16.6% and 5.1% to 6.5%, respectively. The most dramatic landuse changes occur in the middle and downstream regions; (2) The combined landuse changes do not alter the average flow metrics obviously at the catchment outlet, but slightly increase the high flow metrics, particularly the extreme high flows; (3) The impacts on runoff metrics in the sub-catchments are more obvious than those at the catchment outlet. For the average flow metrics, the most impacted metric is the runoff depth in the dry season (October similar to May) with a relative change from -10.9% to 11.6%, and the critical impact factors are the impervious surface and grass. For the high flow metrics, the extreme high flow depth is increased most significantly with a relative change from -0.6% to 10.5%, and the critical impact factors are the impervious surface and dryland agriculture; (4) The runoff depth metrics in the sub-catchments are increased because of the landuse changes from dryland agriculture to impervious surface, but are decreased because of the landuse changes from dryland agriculture or impervious surface to grass or forest. The results of this study provide useful information for urban planning such as Sponge City design. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB We investigated temporal variations and vertical evolution of dissolved gaseous tracers (CFC-11, CFC-12, SF6, and noble gases), as well as H-3/He-3 ratio to determine groundwater recharge processes of a shallow unconfined, hard-rock aquifer in an agricultural catchment. We sampled dissolved gas concentration at 4 locations along the hillslope of a small experimental watershed, over 6 hydrological years, between 2 and 6 times per years, for a total of 20 field campaigns. We collected groundwater samples in the fluctuation zone and the permanently saturated zone using piezometers from 5 to 20 m deep. The purpose of this work is i) to assess the benefits of using gaseous tracers like CFCs and SF6 to study very young groundwater with flows suspected to be heterogeneous and variable in time, ii) to characterize the processes that control dissolved gas concentrations in groundwater during the recharge of the aquifer, and iii) to understand the evolution of recharge flow processes by repeated measurement campaigns, taking advantage of a long monitoring in a site devoted to recharge processes investigation.
   Gas tracer profiles are compared at different location of the catchment and for different hydrologic conditions. In addition, we compare results from CFCs and H-3/He-3 analysis to define the flow model that best explains tracer concentrations. Then we discuss the influence of recharge events on tracer concentrations and residence time and propose a temporal evolution of residence times for the unsaturated zone and the permanently saturated zone. These results are used to gain a better understanding of the conceptual model of the catchment and flow processes especially during recharge events. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Arsenic (As)-contaminated groundwater is a global concern with potential detrimental effects on the health of hundreds of millions of people worldwide. However, the extent of this problem may be more severe than anticipated, as many wells have not been tested and may contain unsafe-level of As. An optimized statistical regression model was developed to predict the probability of geogenic high As groundwater (As > 10 mu g/L) in this study. Easily obtained hydrogeochemical and geological parameters that are significantly related to As geochemical behaviors were selected as explanatory variables in the model. The results indicate that pH, Cl-, HCO3-, SO42-, and NO3- concentrations, stratigraphic information, and well depth are excellent predictors of As exposure in the Datong Basin, China. Predicted unsafe wells correspond well with the known distribution of high As groundwater in the Datong Basin. The successful application of a data set from Bangladesh also demonstrated the applicability and credibility of this proposed method. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Urmia Lake, once the second largest saline lake in the world, is on the verge of complete desiccation. It has been suggested that the desiccation is caused by intensified human activities, especially irrigation, and prolonged droughts in the lake basin, but there is a lack of quantitative analysis to attribute the observed water level decline to natural and anthropogenic causes. In this study, we use remote sensing data, ground observations, and a hydrological model with human impact assessment capabilities (HiGW-MAT) to investigate the natural and human-induced changes in the hydrology of Urmia Lake basin from 1980 to 2010. Based on the analysis of remote sensing data, we find a similar to 98% and similar to 180% increase in agricultural lands and urban areas, respectively, from 1987 through 2016, with a corresponding shrinkage in lake area by similar to 86%. Further, we use model results to examine the changes in terrestrial water storage (TWS) over the basin including the lake. Results indicate that TWS declined over the lake region and the lake lost water at a faster rate than the watershed did. Comparison of river inflow to the lake from two simulations-one with and the other without human activities-suggests that human water management activities caused a reduction in streamfiow of similar to 1.74 km(3)/year from 1995 to 2010, which accounts for similar to 86% of the total depletion in lake volume during the same period. It is also found that irrigation water requirement almost tripled, causing high withdrawals from rivers. These results demonstrate that the on-going depletion of Urmia Lake is not solely due to prolonged droughts but also due to direct anthropogenic alterations which caused significant changes in land use, streamflow, and water storage within the basin. This study provides important insights on the natural and human-induced changes in the hydrology of Urmia Lake and highlights the need for a high resolution regional scale modeling approach for better understanding potential future changes toward restoring the lake and putting forth a course of action to stop further desiccation and avoid a major environmental catastrophe.

AB The Fertile Crescent (FC) region comprises the east coast of the Mediterranean Sea and the northern part of the Arabian Peninsula. The FC suffered two severe drought episodes separated by a 7-year period, in 1998-2000 and 2007-2009, which are considered the most severe episodes to hit the region in the last 50 years. A Lagrangian model (FLEXPART) and ERA-Interim data (with a 1 degrees x 1 degrees lat-long resolution) were used to identify for the first time the climatological sources of moisture for the FC and their characteristics. Variability and the source-receptor relationships, concerning their contribution to the precipitation, and the implications regarding the transport of moisture changes over the FC, during the wet season (October-May) from 1980 to 2014 were analysed. The main climatological moisture sources during this period were determined to be the FC itself, the eastern Mediterranean Sea, the Red Sea, the Persian Gulf, the Arabian Sea, the Caspian and Black Seas, and the central and western parts of the Mediterranean Sea.
   The analysis showed higher anomalous conditions in the moisture transport from some moisture sources during the two outstanding drought episodes. The key feature of the wet seasons during these episodes was a deficit in the moisture losses over the studied area related to the FC itself, the Red and Arabian Seas sources, followed and to a lesser extent by the eastern Mediterranean Sea over the northern part of the FC region. Nevertheless, the moisture supply deficit from the sources was much greater during the 2007-2009 drought event. The SPEI index at large scales (24 months) showed that the 2007-2009 episode was part of longer-term drought conditions that had been developing over the previous months, reinforcing the drought severity given recycling processes attributed to the FC. During the two extreme drought episodes, the mountainous terrain over the northern and eastern FC suffered the highest precipitation deficits, and these areas are, precisely, the most influenced by two of the major moisture sources, namely, the FC and eastern Mediterranean Sea. The decreased moisture contribution from these main sources led to more intense droughts over the region. As a result, both regions should be considered as hotspots to signal severe or extreme droughts in the region. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB With ignorance and potential surprise dominating decision making in water resources, a framework for dealing with such uncertainty is a critical need in hydrology. We operationalize the 'potential surprise' criterion proposed by Shackle, Vickers, and Katzner (SVK) to derive decision rules to manage water resources under uncertainty and ignorance. We apply this framework to managing water supply systems in Bangladesh that face severe, naturally occurring arsenic contamination. The uncertainty involved with arsenic in water supplies makes the application of conventional analysis of decision-making ineffective. Given the uncertainty and surprise involved in such cases, we find that optimal decisions tend to favor actions that avoid irreversible outcomes instead of conventional cost-effective actions. We observe that a diversification of the water supply system also emerges as a robust strategy to avert unintended outcomes of water contamination. Shallow wells had a slight higher optimal level (36%) compare to deep wells and surface treatment which had allocation levels of roughly 32% under each. The approach can be applied in a variety of other cases that involve decision making under uncertainty and surprise, a frequent situation in natural resources management. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB Abrupt changes are an important manifestation of hydrological variability. How to accurately detect the abrupt changes in hydrological time series and evaluate their significance is an important issue, but methods for dealing with them effectively are lacking. In this study, we propose an approach to evaluate the significance of abrupt changes in time series at five levels: no, weak, moderate, strong, and dramatic. The approach was based on an index of correlation coefficient calculated for the original time series and its abrupt change component. A bigger value of correlation coefficient reflects a higher significance level of abrupt change. Results of Monte-Carlo experiments verified the reliability of the proposed approach, and also indicated the great influence of statistical characteristics of time series on the significance level of abrupt change. The approach was derived from the relationship between correlation coefficient index and abrupt change, and can estimate and grade the significance levels of abrupt changes in hydrological time series.
   Application of the proposed approach to ten major watersheds in China showed that abrupt changes mainly occurred in five watersheds in northern China, which have arid or semi-arid climate and severe shortages of water resources. Runoff processes in northern China were more sensitive to precipitation change than those in southern China. Although annual precipitation and surface water resources amount (SWRA) exhibited a harmonious relationship in most watersheds, abrupt changes in the latter were more significant. Compared with abrupt changes in annual precipitation, human activities contributed much more to the abrupt changes in the corresponding SWRA, except for the Northwest Inland River watershed.

AB Intense precipitation events in the Mediterranean often lead to devastating flash floods (FF). FF modelling is affected by several kinds of uncertainties and Hydrological Ensemble Prediction Systems (HEPS) are designed to take those uncertainties into account. The major source of uncertainty comes from rainfall forcing and convective-scale meteorological ensemble prediction systems can manage it for forecasting purpose. But other sources are related to the hydrological modelling part of the HEPS. This study focuses on the uncertainties arising from the hydrological model parameters and initial soil moisture with aim to design an ensemble-based version of an hydrological model dedicated to Mediterranean fast responding rivers simulations, the ISBA-TOP coupled system. The first step consists in identifying the parameters that have the strongest influence on FF simulations by assuming perfect precipitation. A sensitivity study is carried out first using a synthetic framework and then for several real events and several catchments. Perturbation methods varying the most sensitive parameters as well as initial soil moisture allow designing an ensemble-based version of ISBA-TOP. The first results of this system on some real events are presented. The direct perspective of this work will be to drive this ensemble-based version with the members of a convective-scale meteorological ensemble prediction system to design a complete HEPS for FF forecasting.

AB Elevated levels of selenium (Se) in aqueous environments can harm aquatic life and endanger livestock and human health. Although Se occurs naturally in the rocks and soils of many alluvial aquifers, mining and agricultural activities can increase its rate of mobilization and transport to surface waters. Attention is given here to regions where nonpoint source return flows from irrigated lands carry pollutant loads to aquifers and streams, contributing to concentrations that violate regulatory and performance standards. Of particular concern is the heightened level and mobilization of Se influenced by nitrate (NO3), a harmful pollutant in its own right. We present a numerical model that simulates the reactive transport of Se and nitrogen (N) species in a coupled groundwater-surface water system. Building upon a conceptual model that incorporates the major processes affecting Se and NO3 transport in an irrigated watershed, the model links the finite-difference models MODFLOW, UZF-RT3D, and OTIS, to simulate flow and reactive transport of multiple chemical species in both the aquifer and a stream network, with mass exchange between the two. The capability of the new model is showcased by calibration, testing, and application to a 500 km(2) region in Colorado's Lower Arkansas River Valley using a rich data set gathered over a 10-yr period. Simulation of spatial and temporal distributions of Se concentration reveals conditions that exceed standards in groundwater for approximately 20% of the area. For the Arkansas River, standards are exceeded by 290%-450%. Simulation indicates that river concentrations of NO3 alone are near the current interim standard for the total of all dissolved N species. These results indicate the need for future use of the developed model to investigate the prospects for land and water best management practices to decrease pollutant levels. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB The widely used design storms in urban drainage networks has different drawbacks. One of them is that the shape of the rainfall temporal pattern is fixed regardless of climate change. However, previous studies have shown that the temporal pattern may scale with temperature due to climate change, which consequently affects peak flow. Thus, in addition to the scaling of the rainfall volume, the scaling relationship for the rainfall temporal pattern with temperature needs to be investigated by deriving the scaling values for each fraction within storm events, which is lacking in many parts of the world including the UK. Therefore, this study analysed rainfall data from 28 gauges close to the study area with a 15-min resolution as well as the daily temperature data. It was found that, at warmer temperatures, the rainfall temporal pattern becomes less uniform, with more intensive peak rainfall during higher intensive times and weaker rainfall during less intensive times. This is the case for storms with and without seasonal separations. In addition, the scaling values for both the rainfall volume and the rainfall fractions (i.e. each segment of rainfall temporal pattern) for the summer season were found to be higher than the corresponding results for the winter season. Applying the derived scaling values for the temporal pattern of the summer season in a hydrodynamic sewer network model produced high percentage change of peak flow between the current and future climate. This study on the scaling of rainfall fractions is the first in the UK, and its findings are of importance to modellers and designers of sewer systems because it can provide more robust scenarios for flooding mitigation in urban areas.

AB Sediment cores from aquatic environments can provide valuable information about historical pollution levels and sources. However, there is little understanding of the uncertainties associated with these findings. The aim of this study is to fill this knowledge gap by proposing a framework for quantifying the uncertainties in historical heavy metal pollution records reconstructed from sediment cores. This uncertainty framework consists of six sources of uncertainty: uncertainties in (1) metals analysis methods, (2) spatial variability of sediment core heavy metal profiles, (3) sub-sampling intervals, (4) the sediment chronology, (5) the assumption that metal levels in bed sediments reflect the magnitude of metal inputs into the aquatic system, and (6) post-depositional transformation of metals. We apply this uncertainty framework to an urban floodplain lake in South-East Australia (Willsmere Billabong). We find that for this site, uncertainties in historical dated heavy metal profiles can be up to 176%, largely due to uncertainties in the sediment chronology, and in the assumption that the settled heavy metal mass is equivalent to the heavy metal mass entering the aquatic system. As such, we recommend that future studies reconstructing historical pollution records using sediment cores from aquatic systems undertake an investigation of the uncertainties in the reconstructed pollution record, using the uncertainty framework provided in this study. We envisage that quantifying and understanding the uncertainties associated with the reconstructed pollution records will facilitate the practical application of sediment core heavy metal profiles in environmental management projects.

AB The amorphous soft magnetic Fe88Zr11B1 ribbon was fabricated and the magnetocaloric effect of it was investigated through the measurement of magnetization in this work. To enhance its magnetocaloric effect, Co is selected as a microalloying addition to this precursor. Among these ribbons, the replacement of Fe by minor Co, compared with the replacement of Zr by Co, gives more increment in Curie temperature and magnetic entropy change. Fe86Zr11B1Co2 exhibits the largest peak value of magnetic entropy change of 1.73 Jkg(-1) K-1 and Fe88Zr9B1Co2 shows the largest refrigerant capacity of 149.7 Jkg(-1) for an applied field of 15 kOe. Furthermore, a significant magnetic entropy change can be obtained using multiphase materials in this work. Under a magnetic field change of 15 kOe, the maximum improvement of the refrigerant capacity by 38.6%, in comparison with those of the individual alloys, is obtained for the layered composite of Fe88Zr11B1 (50 wt%) and Fe86Zr11B1CO2 (50 wt%). Besides, a quite broad S-M(T) curve around room temperature of the amorphous composite is observed, which is a key feature for an Ericsson magnetic refrigeration cycle.

AB The compositional dependence of the dissolution rates of ternary alkali-alkaline earth borate glasses in water were characterized. These glasses dissolve congruently and the dissolution kinetics were linear, following the contracting volume model for spherical particles. The dissolution rates were dependent on the glass structure, with slower rates associated with glasses with greater fractions of four-coordinated borate sites in their network structures, as determined by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. For glasses with a fixed alkaline earth identity, the dissolution rates increased in the order Li < Na < K. For glasses with a constant alkali identity, the dissolution rates increased in the order Ca < Sr approximate to Mg. The effects of composition on dissolution rates are discussed in terms of the reactions between water and different borate and metal-oxide sites in the glass structure.

Thin films were prepared by the thermal evaporation process onto normal glass substrates in a vacuum about 8.2 x 10(-4) Pa. The deposition rate and the film thickness were maintained constant at about 8 nm/s and 200 nm, respectively. X-ray diffraction was used to check the amorphous nature of thin-film samples. The resistance of the film samples has been measured in the temperature range 293 K to 473 K by using the two-point probe technique. DC-electrical conductivity was determined from the resistance measurements. The sheet resistance, the conduction mechanisms, activation energies, Mott parameters, barrier potential energy, trapping state energy and the density of localized states near the Fermi level, were investigated and studied. Obtained electrical data of the ternary Cd-S-Se thin films were investigated and studied in terms of Mott's variable range hopping model. All studied electrical parameters were found to be strongly dependent on the Se-content.

AB New ferromagnetic high-entropy bulk metallic glasses (HE-BMGs) with superior glass-fanning ability (GFA) and high strength were developed in the pseudo quaternary FeCoNi(P, C, B, Si) system. The HE-BMG rods were fabricated by topper mold casting method in the composition range of Fe25Co25Ni25(P0.3-0.5C0.1-0.3B0.2-0.3Si0.1-0.3)(25), in which the Fe25Co25Ni25(P0.4C0.2B0.2Si0.2)(25) and Fe25Co25Ni25(P0.5C0.1B0.2Si0.2)(25) alloys Possess the largest critical diameter of 2.0 mm. The HE-BMGs exhibit excellent soft magnetic and mechanical properties, i.e., low coercivity of 0.8-2.1 A/m, high saturation magnetization of 0.80-0.86 T, high compressive yield strength of 2970-3076 MPa, and large plastic strain of 1.9-2.1%. The mechanisms of the high GFA and good magnetic softness of the alloys were discussed.

AB In the present work, microwave dielectric properties of CaO-MgO-SiO2 glass-ceramics based on the stoichiometric composition of diopside (CaMgSi2O6) were accurately investigated. The initial glass was prepared utilizing conventional melt quenching technique. Thermal properties of the milled glass particles were monitored by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), dilatometry and hot stage microcopy (HSM). Glass-ceramic specimens were prepared through simultaneous one-step sinter-crystallization procedure. In order to achieve high quality factor (high-Q) microwave dielectric properties, glass-ceramics were also prepared through two-step sintering technique. The crystallization behavior of the heat treated specimens was examined by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and field emission scanning electron microscopy (FFSEM).
   Based on the obtained results, diopside precipitated as the only crystalline phase in all sintered glass-ceramics. Diopside glass-ceramics sintered through one-step (at 925 degrees C for 4 h) and two-step (at 800 degrees C for 4 h, then followed by heating at 950 degrees C for 2 h) procedures exhibited high-Q microwave dielectric of 56,952 GHz and 64,524 GHz, respectively. The degrees of crystallization and crystallite sizes of the glass-ceramics prepared from both sintering procedures were also characterized.

AB Using Quantum Sutton-Chen potentials, Molecular Dynamics was used to obtain an atomistic description of melting, glass formation and crystallisation processes for palladium metal, metallic silicon and their alloys, from PdSi to Pd5Si. Glass formation and crystallisation were investigated using different cooling rates, by analysing the radial distribution function, enthalpy, density, volume, and diffusion coefficient. As expected, glass forms at high cooling rates, while crystallisation occurs at slower rates. The glass transition temperature was estimated from the Wendt-Abraham parameter vs temperature curves and the splitting of peaks in the radial distribution function. The effect of the Pd/Si ratio on the glass transition was studied by analysing the volume change during cooling of the Pd-Si alloys. The glass forming ability was found to increase with increasing Pd concentration in the alloys. Overall, our results reveal that Quantum Sutton-Chen potentials allow good descriptions of the melting, glass transition, and crystallisation during the heating and cooling processes.

AB Crystallization under isothermal condition of supercooled liquid and amorphous silicene (a-silicene) models has been studied via molecular dynamics (MD) simulation with Stillinger-Weber (SW) interaction potential. Supercooled liquid and a-silicene models containing 10(4) atoms are obtained via the rapid solidification process from the melt. At each given temperature below and above T-g, models are annealed from 5 ns up to 8 ns in order to investigate aging effect on two-dimensional structural arrangement of disordered Si-atoms. Time dependence of thermodynamic and structural quantities is analyzed including potential energy, radial distribution function (RDF), coordination number, buckling degree, ring and bond-angle distribution. We find that 2D-crystallization of supercooled liquid and a-silicene exhibits a first-order behavior. Time-temperature-transformation (TTT) diagram exhibits a commonly nose-shape by analyzing a wide temperature range from supercooled liquid to amorphous state. High critical cooling rates of a-silicene are found indicating low glass-formation ability of the system. Thermodynamic properties of crystallization of silicenes attained after-aging are studied in details and we clarify a novel scenario of crystallization. A homogenous tendency of natural quenched-in nucleation atoms aggregate into larger dusters in 2D Si supercooled liquid sheet. Consequently, a polycrystalline layer of silicene is developed with decent low-numbered chain defects as grain boundary. In contrast, crystallization of a-silicene shows a partial crystallization behavior. Crystal clusters are found to exhibit a heterogeneous growth in models obtained below T-g. Crystal formed from a-silicene is a quasi-equilibrium state with a large number of defects still existed in models after a long relaxing time.

AB Neuraminidase (NA) inhibitors can suppress NA activity to block the release of progeny virions and are effective against influenza viruses. As potential anti-flu drugs with unique functions, NA inhibitors are greatly concerned by the worldwide scientists. It has been reported recently that one of the novel quindoline derivatives named 7a, could inhibit both A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (H1N1) NA (NA(PR)) and A/California/04/09 (H1N1) NA (NA(CA)). However, potential structure differences in the active site could be easily detected between the NA(PR) and NA(CA) according to the flexibilities of their 150-loops located catalytic site. And no obvious 150-cavity could be observed in NA(C)(A) crystal structure. In order to explore whether 7a could trigger the inhibition against these two NAs in the same way, a serial molecular dynamics simulation approach were applied in this study. The results indicated that 7a could be adopted under a relatively extended pose in the active center of NA(PR). While in NA(CA)-7a complex, the derivate preferred to be recognized and located on the side of active center. Interestingly, the potential of 7a was also found to be able to change the flexibility of the 150-loop in NA(CA) that is absent of 150-cavity. Furthermore, a 150-cavity-like architecture could be induced in the active site of NA(CA). The results of this study revealed two kinds of binding modes of this novel small molecule inhibitor against NM that might provide a theoretical basis for proposing novel inhibition mechanism and developing future influenza A virus inhibitors.

DE cryoEM vitrification; Spotiton; Nanowire grids; TEM grids
AB We have developed a self-blotting TEM grid for use with a novel instrument for vitrifying samples for cryo-electron microscopy (cryoEM). Nanowires are grown on the copper surface of the grid using a simple chemical reaction and the opposite smooth side is used to adhere to a holey sample substrate support, for example carbon or gold. When small volumes of sample are applied to the nanowire grids the wires effectively act as blotting paper to rapidly wick away the liquid, leaving behind a thin film. In this technical note, we present a detailed description of how we make these grids using a variety of substrates fenestrated with either lacey or regularly spaced holes. We explain how we characterize the quality of the grids and we describe their behavior under a variety of conditions.

AB ZnO rhombic microstructures were fabricated via microwave assisted approach using ZnCl2 and NaOH as raw materials by simply adjusting the ratios of [Zn2+]/[OH ] as 1:8 (pH of reaction mixture at 13.9). Controlling [Zn2+]/[OH ] as 1:1, 1:2, 1:3, 1:4, 1:5, 1:6, and 1:7 respectively (changing the pH of the precursor solution), ZnO microstructures with different morphologies were also synthesized. The characterization results revealed that as-obtained ZnO nanocrystals are of wurtzite structure and of the average grain sizes between 17 and 34 nm. In terms of BET surface areas, the photocatalytic activity of five typical ZnO samples was evaluated by degradations of methyl orange, and rhombic ZnO exhibited the better photocatalytic property, which could be attributed to its larger surface area, high crystallinity, and small particle size. Rhombic ZnO also showed good performance in photocatalytic eliminating Rhodamine-B. The synthesis and application of rhombic ZnO may contribute to development of photocatalyst for environmental issues. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A series of CdS/BiOI (Cd-Bi) heterojunction photocatalysts with different CdS loading were prepared by a simple ultrasonic-assisted calcination method. All samples were characterized by XRD (X-ray powder diffraction), N-2 physisorption isotherms and other techniques to investigate the impact of heterostructure. Among them, Cd-Bi-0.30 (0.30 represents the mass ratio of CdS to BiOI) shows a significantly improved photocatalytic oxidation capacity under LED lamp irradiation due to heterojunction construction and a suitable additive amount, leading to photogenerated electron-hole pairs separation promoting, so that more charge carriers can participate in the photoreaction. Finally, the mechanism of photocatalytic oxidation of Hg-0 by the as-prepared CdS/BiOI photocatalyst was discussed in detail. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Photoluminescence study of interstitial oxygen defects in ZnO
   nanostructures
SO MATERIALS LETTERS

DT Article
DE ZnO; Defects; PL; Nanocrystalline materials
AB ZnO defect luminescence is a fascinating but still highly controversial issue. Herein, the role of interstitial oxygen played on the photoluminescence (PL) property of ZnO nanostructures is investigated through oxygen plasma exposure and low temperature O-2 annealing. In contrast to previous reports, no interstitial oxygen related deep level emission was observed in PL spectra from room temperature (RT) to 7 K after oxygen-rich treatments, except apparent suppression of the exciton emission due to the upward band bending effect. This work illustrates that the isolated interstitial oxygen seems not to cause the widely reported yellow/orange emission regardless of the ZnO growth method. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB The three-dimensional multiscale reinforcement of graphene aerogel-carbon fibers (GA-CF) was prepared by one-step reduction and self-assembly of graphene oxide with L-ascorbic acid followed by freeze-drying. The interconnected GA networks serving as bridges guaranteed efficient stress transfer from epoxy to CF. GA-CF exhibited improvement of the interfacial shear strength from 38.8 MPa to 71.1 MPa, and the interfacial failure mode was transformed from adhesive failure to cohesive failure. The enhancement of interfacial properties could be attributed to enhanced surface roughness, increased surface area of the GA assembled CF and strengthened mechanical interlocking between GA and epoxy.

AB Mesoporous hydroxyapatite is widely applied in biomedical and environmental fields due to its high surface area and adsorption capacity. In current work a one-step hydrothermal method to synthesize mesoporous HA was developed with the assistance of a cost-effective template vitamin C. It was observed the pore size and morphology of hydrothermally synthesized HA were correlated to applied solution composition. A combination of calcium hydroxide, orthophosphate, and vitamin C can finally result in mesoporous rod-like HA nanoparticles with surface area of 88 m(2).g(-1) and pore size of 15.7 nm on average. The mesoporous HA exhibited enhanced adsorption of model drug doxorubicin in comparison to conventionally synthesized HA as expected. Consequently, this work provides new pathway to prepare mesoporous HA with advantages of economy and convenience. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The values of piezoelectric output of the devices assembled by PVDF fibrous membrane linearly fit with the product of the numerical values (C-EP, content of effective piezo-phase) of crystallinity and beta-phase proportion in electrospun fibers. With the optimized parameters of electric field (15 kV) and rotation speed (500 rpm) in electrospinning, the maximal output of 2.8 V and 1.32 mu A were obtained.

AB We have realized the selective detections of acetone and H2S vapors through tailoring the surface microstructures of ZnO crystals. Specifically, ZnO prisms mainly incased in equivalent [1 0 0] facets exhibit the highest response to H2S, and ZnO twin-spheres exposed in +/-(0 0 1) facets show selective response to acetone. In comparison, the ZnO dumbbells exposed both in +/-(0 0 1) and equivalent [1 0 0] facets respond to acetone and H2S similarly. The selective responses of the sensors are closely related to the adsorption energies (E-a) of the chemicals to the special facets of ZnO supercrystals, based on the firstprinciples calculations. The +/-(0 0 1) and equivalent [1 0 0] facets of the ZnO crystals prefer to absorb acetone and H2S, respectively, which offer a chance of selectively sensing the chemicals. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB In this study, novel BiOCl/MoS2 nanocomposites with Z-scheme structure were successfully obtained by a facile one-step hydrothermal method, and the products were evaluated by XRD, SEM, XPS, DRS. Results showed that the MoS2 nanosheets adhered well to surface of the BiOCl, and the BiOCl/MoS2 possessed an excellent Rhodamine B degrading rate of 98.6% within 21 min under visible light irradiation. Radical trapping experiments indicated that center dot OH and h+ were main reactive species responsible for the degradations. The fantastic Z-scheme structure of the BiOCl/MoS2 heterogeneous not only retained the photogenerated holes with higher redox ability but also decreases their recombination rate.

AB Cost-effective and efficient oxygen evolving electrocatalysts are urgently required for energy conversion technology. In this work, nanocrystalline NiS particles were prepared by a facile one-step mechanical alloying method as a promising oxygen evolution reaction electrocatalyst. The nanocrystalline NiS catalysts exhibited an overpotential of 354 mV at the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) after 1000 cycles Cyclic voltammetry scan activation in alkaline electrolyte (1 M KOH). The Tafel slope reduced 33% to 116 mV/dec after the activation. The working electrode could maintain its 81.3% catalytic activity after the 10 h long-term test. The improved OER performance of the nc-NiS catalysts was benefit from the changes on the morphology and composition, which were induced by the CV1000 activation. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB The mesoporous Co3O4 with shape of fans has been successfully synthesized by a simple hydrothermal approach from cobalt nitrate, urea, gelation and subsequent calcination process. Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscope (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and nitrogen adsorption/desorption analysis are characterized to demonstrate the crystal structure, morphology, and microstructure of Co3O4 nanofans (Co3O4 NFs). When applied as a gas sensing material, the sensitivity of as-prepared Co3O4 is obviously higher than the Co3O4 nanosheets (Co3O4 NSs). The well gas sensing performances to xylene properties make this mesoporous fan-like Co3O4 be a good candidate for xylene sensors. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Carbon nanotubes and SiC nanoparticles reinforced Na and F co-doped hydroxyapatite coating (CS-NFH) was fabricated by electrochemical deposition method. The morphology, microstructure, shear strength, wettability and in-vitro bioactivity of CS-NFH coating were analyzed. Homogeneous and crackfree CSNFH coatings composed of spherical particles were achieved. The shear strength for CS-NFH was 9.04 MPa, which was more than twice the value of that for pure hydroxyapatite coating. Wettability test showed CS-NFH coating had super-hydrophilicity surface with water contact angle of 0 degrees. The in-vitro bioactivity test showed that the coating could induce the formation of new apatite in simulated body fluid. CS-NFH may have potential application as coating materials in orthopaedic applications. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this present work, the preparation of partially graphitic nanoporous carbon from biomass (bamboo bagasse) is carried out using potassium ferrocyanide and -KOH as activating agent with controlled temperature and gas flow rates. The physico-chemical properties of biomass-derived graphitic nano-porous carbon were characterized by X-ray Diffraction (XRD), Fourier Transform Infra-Red Spectroscopy (FTIR), Thermal Gravimetric Analysis (TGA), Raman spectroscopy, Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) and electrochemical measurements. It is interesting that the activation with the iron salts plays a significant role in the formation of graphitic structures. The graphitic nanoporous carbonaceous materials show high specific surface area of 1360 m(2) g(-1), low impedance, large pore volume and high specific capacitance. Thus, the iron-catalyzed graphitic carbon is excellent candidate for the supercapacitor applications. This contemporary-novel method to synthesis of nanoporous carbon represents a great potential for apparent and diversified applications in energy storage materials. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

ID EVOLUTION
AB Chemically modified graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) nanolayers have been developed with simultaneous modifications through protonation, sulfur-doping and Pt-loading. The obtained materials have been extensively studied for their structural, morphological, optical, surface area, photocurrent density, impedance and photocatalytic hydrogen production properties under solar light irradiations. The synergistic effect of these modifications is found to increase their photocatalytic efficiencies into many folds. From the obtained results, the mechanism of the observed efficiency can be proposed as follows; (i) the protonation led to a stronger exfoliation of g-C3N4 from its bulk-structure to nanolayers, while (ii) the sulfur doping reduces the band gap energy through altering their band edge positions and (iii) the Pt-loading enhances the charge separation, which facilitated more number of electrons to reduce H+ ions into H-2 molecules.

AB In the present work, we report a new activating agent (NaCl: KCl) (1: 1) for the synthesis of nanoporous carbon from Java Kapok tree shell (1: 1) with different controlled temperature under inert atmosphere. Additionally, surface morphology, physico-chemical and electrochemical properties of the nanoporous carbon are characterized. The obtained Kapok shell derived nanoporous carbon possessed a large surface area of 1260 m(2) g(-1), pore volume of 0.439 cm(3) g(-1), pore size of 1.241 nm, and microspore volume of 0.314 cm(3) g(-1). The nanoporous carbon-based electrode material exhibited higher capacitance of 169 F g(-1) with 97% capacity retention after 10,000 cycles at 1 A g(-1). We believe that this new activation agent can be significant contribution in the new carbon technology for energy storage materials. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The tribocorrosion behavior of the Ti-30Zr alloy as dental implant in Hank's solution was evaluated. The results demonstrated that the wear volumes of the alloy increased as the applied load increase with/without electrochemical corrosion. The wear volumes acquired with corrosion exceeded the wear volumes without corrosion, whereas the difference between these two increased as the load increased. The material loss induced by the corrosion increased and the corrosion potential decreased as the loads increased, due to the interaction between wear and corrosion. The potentiodynamic polarization curves were acquired during wear. The corrosion potential (E-corr) of -0.493 V was acquired at 1.0 N, while the Ecorr of -0.786 V was acquired at 5.0 N, indicating that the potential moved negatively as the applied loads increased, due to mechanical wear. Through observations of the 3-dimension surface and the SEM images of the worn surfaces, the visible scratches/grooves were observed along the sliding direction, indicating a predominant abrasive mechanism.

AB In this study, chitosan and lanthanum hydroxide composite aerogel beads were prepared for phosphorus adsorption via co precipitation and supercritical carbon dioxide drying technique. The porous structure of composite aerogel beads was investigated by scanning electron microscope (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) measurements. The results showed that the aerogel bead with mass ratio of chitosan to lanthanum chloride 100: 50 exhibited a larger surface area of 172.74 m(2)/g and a pore volume of 1.05 cm(3)/g, respectively. Also the phosphorus adsorption kinetics of the aerogel bead showed a faster adsorption rate and the larger adsorption capacity (148.33 mg/g) for phosphorus. In addition, adsorption kinetics model analysis showed that the phosphorus adsorption process fitted both pseudo-first order and pseudo-second order kinetic model. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Inorganic perovskite materials have drawn significant interest in photocatalytic application owing to their excellent photo absorbing nature. In this regard, we have synthesized pristine and silver (Ag) modified lanthanum cobaltite (LaCoO3) perovskite by hydrothermal method and characterized by multitechnique approaches. The structural, absorption and emission studies reveal that addition of Ag influences the crystallite size, absorption co-efficient and electron hole recombination rate of LaCoO3. Morphological analysis shows that tetragonal morphology of the pure LaCoO3 is changed to square shape morphology on addition of Ag, which reveals the dispersion of Ag into LaCoO3. Electrochemical analysis demonstrates the possible electrochemical activity of the materials and confirms that Ag provides higher charge transfer kinetics and stability to LaCoO3. In addition, Ag-LaCoO3 degrades methylene blue (MB) in higher rate (99% in 10 min) compared to LaCoO3 (75% in 10 min). Mechanism behinds the photocatalytic activity has been discussed. Hence, the present investigation explores Ag modified LaCoO3 as a newpotential candidate for the application in photocatalytic activity under sunlight irradiation. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB The electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding effectiveness and the intrinsic electrical properties of polymeric material filled with two different nanostructured fillers were investigated. The polymeric material being polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) and nickel oxide (NiO) and barium titanate (BaTiO3) were used as nanofillers. The PVDF/NiO/BaTiO3 nanocomposite films were prepared with the variable concentration of nanofillers using solvent casting method. The structural and morphological analysis of PVDF/NiO/BaTiO3 nanocomposite films was carried out using Fourier transform Infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Scanning electron microscopy (SEM). To understand the EMI shielding effectiveness, the absorption was studied in the Ku-band frequency range (8 Hz-12 Hz). The FTIR analysis shows the interaction between the phases at varying concentrations of nanofillers and the XRD analysis shows characteristic peaks of all the constituents of PVDF/NiO/BaTiO3 nanocomposites. SEM micrographs of PVDF/NiO/BaTiO3 nanocomposite film reveal homogeneous dispersion of both NiO and BatiO(3) in the PVDF matrix. The impact of variable concentration of nanofillers on the overall shielding effectiveness (SE) was also investigated with the shielding effectiveness of -11.5 dB. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB Flower-like Ni(OH)(2) nanostructured was synthesized by using simple chemical bath deposition (CBD) method as a binder-free electrode for supercapacitor. The nanowalls with thickness 50-70 nm were connected to each other forming pores, which further results in higher electrochemical performance by the virtue of easy transportation of electrolyte and ions to active mass. The maximum specific capacitance of flower-like Ni(OH)(2) is found 1065 F g(-1) at current density 15 mA s(-1) with excellent rate capability. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The power conversion of perovskite solar cells has increased steadily and reached 22.1%, recently. This has led the researchers to study lead-free halide perovskite materials like Cs2SnI6 due to the toxic nature of lead used in the record-breaking organic-inorganic perovskite structures. Since the presence of an intermediate band in semiconductors leads to enhancement of efficiency of the solar cells, we have also investigated the electronic structure of Cs2SnI6, to find whether the intermediate band is likely to exist in the middle of the band gap. The computational results for the electronic band structure and density of states indicate that Cs2SnI6 contains an intermediate band (IB). Additional absorption peaks that appear in the optical spectra of this material presented in this paper explicitly confirm this. All these studies and the presence of an IB that we identified in Cs2SnI6 suggests that Cs2SnI6 may have high potential used as intermediate band solar cell material. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

ID DESIGN
AB The simultaneous photocatalytic degradation of dye-polluted water and hydrogen production has been demonstrated on the lanthanum-modified TiO2 (La-TiO2) nanostructures. The observed changes in the X-ray diffraction pattern of La-TiO2 with respect to pristine-TiO2 indicated the incorporation of La into the lattices of TiO2. The surface adsorption analysis and electron microscopy images revealed the enhanced surface area with spherical and rod-like morphology for TiO2 and La-TiO2 respectively. The observed red-shift in the absorption spectrum and the estimated band-gap energy indicated that the La-doping sufficiently altered the band-structure of TiO2 to absorb visible light. The calculated band-edge positions revealed that La doping suitably altered the band-edge potential of TiO2 for the simultaneous degradation and hydrogen production.

AB We present a novel approach for tuning orientation in ALD deposited ZnO nanofilm by inserting interfacial buffer layer (IBL) at interface between film and substrate, which is found to induce strong orientation and significant improvement in crystalline quality by largely decreasing grain boundary (GB) area through tailoring nucleation process. As a result, the UV emission in ZnO film with IBL is enhanced by over an order of magnitude due to the reduction of surface quenching at GB. Meanwhile, the decrease of electron scattering at GB also helps improve the electrical mobility of the film, leading to great reduction in resistivity.

AB Vertically aligned titanium dioxide (TiO2) nanotubes (NTs) and graphene/TiO2 NTs were fabricated on transparent substrate by anodization of Ti foil. TiO2 NTs in anatase phase with and without graphene films coated on their surface were confirmed by X-ray diffraction (XRD), field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), and Raman spectra. Enhancement of photocurrent and good responsivity of the graphene/TiO2 NT devices were observed as compared with pure-TiO2 NT devices. At the interface, the electrons will transfer from TiO2 to graphene due to the difference in energy levels of the two materials. The heterojunction was formed there, and the photo-excited electron-hole pairs could hinder the charge recombination. The graphene/TiO2 NT devices have high potential for ultraviolet (UV) photodetectors with the possibility to fine-tune properties, and it is worth of further investigation.

AB The specific structure of hollow sphere with hierarchical structure is beneficial to facilitate the gas diffusion and supply more active sites for improving gas sensing performance. In this paper, we report the fabrication of hierarchical SnO2 hollow spheres assembled by ultrathin nanosheets (SnO2 NSHSs) via a template-free hydrothermal method. The formation mechanism and microstructures of the SnO2 NSHSs were discussed and characterized in detail. The SnO2 NSHSs sensor shows a high response and ultrafast response time (5 s) towards ethanol. Furthermore, the SnO2 NSHSs gas sensor also exhibits a low detection limit of ppb level. The enhanced sensing performance can be attributed to the unrestricted gas diffusion in the hierarchical hollow spheres and plenty of active sites on the ultrathin SnO2 nanosheets.

AB Niobium, as pure metal and alloying element, is used in a variety of applications, among them in nuclear industries. Niobium is incorporated into nuclear fission reactors due to its enormous strength and relatively low density. Surface finishing of niobium is often performed in electrochemical polishing processes in view of improving its smoothness, corrosion resistance and its surface cleanability. However, the presently used electropolishing process (EP) is intrinsically linked to the subsurface hydrogenation of niobium, which measurably degrades its properties. The annealing operation, which is used to remove hydrogen from electropolished niobium, is quite a costly and time-consuming process. The traditional electrolyte consisting of a mixture of 96% H2SO4/49% HF acids by volume in a 9: 1 ratio has been substituted for the new one, being a mixture of 70% methanesulfonic acid with 49% hydrofluoric acid by volume in a 3: 1 ratio. The additional imposition of a magnetic field during the electropolishing process-magnetoelectropolishing (MEP) further increases hydrogen removal, when compared to the hydrogen content achieved by the electropolishing process (EP) alone. The aim of the study is to reveal a methodic approach and showing decreasing hydrogenation of niobium samples after consecutive steps of electrochemical polishing. Glow-Discharge Optical Emission Spectroscopy (GDOES) measurements were used to measure the hydrogen content in the surface layer of as-received (AR) niobium and in the samples after EP and MEP processes, and prove its close-tozero content after MEP.

AB The feasibility of the preparation of diopside-fluorapatite based glass-ceramics from blast furnace slag and fluorite tailings was investigated. The results showed that the crystallization of parent glass was strongly dependent on its initial composition of raw materials. With low content of fluorite tailings, the only crystallization product was fluorapatite (Ca-5(PO4)(3)F). Further increase of fluorite tailings will bring the enhancement of crystallization, resulting in the formation of diopside phase (Ca(Mg, Al)(Si, Al)(2)O-6). The diopside-fluorapatite based glass-ceramics with Vickers hardness of 7.36 GPa could be obtained from raw materials with a composition of 40 mass% blast furnace slag and 60 mass% fluorite tailings.

AB Li2FeSiO4 is an important alternative cathode material for the next generation Li-ion batteries due to its high theoretical capacity (330 mA h/g). However, its development has faced great challenges arising from its structural complexity and its poor ionic conductivity. In the present study, the energetics of surface structures and nano particles of the Pmn2(1) polymorph of Li2FeSiO4 are studied by means of first-principles calculations based on density functional theory. The present study demonstrates that, by tailoring the particle size of the Li2FeSiO4, one can increase the diffusion coefficient above 10 (8) cm(2)/s, which is comparable to the the typical one reported for the current generation state-of-the-art material.

ID THIN-FILMS
AB Flexible devices that can sustain large deformations have recently attracted widespread interest. In this paper, we investigate several strain-dependent properties of wrinkled Au/PDMS films. We discover a strain-induced hydrophobic to hydrophilic transition on Au/PDMS due to the transition from the Cassie-Baxter-like state to the Wenzel state. We observe that the Au/PDMS also exhibits strain-dependent SERS behaviours and excellent electrical conductivity and stability and can sustain a tensile strain of similar to 30% for up to 100 cycles. This method is simple, general and feasible, which may be beneficial for the design and fabrication of flexible units for electronic devices, self-cleaning, microfluidic devices, water collection, and stress monitoring.

AB Li-S batteries are ones of the most promising secondary batteries owing to their high-energy density. However, Li-S batteries have some drawbacks, including the poor electrical conductivity and rapid capacity fading. In this work, MnO2 nanosheets/carbon nanotubes composites are synthesized via a simple and rapid hydrothermal deposit route. The carbon nanotubes (CNTs) serve as conductive network for electron. MnO2 nanosheets provide numerous sites to form strong chemical binding with polysulfide. The composite maintains a reversible capacity of 841 mA h g (1) after 100 cycles at 0.5 C, and the rate capacity of 1214 mA h g (1), 1072 mA h g (1), 877 mA h g (1), and 689 mA h g (1) was measured at 0.2 C, 0.5 C, 1 C, 2 C, respectively.

ID ANTIBACTERIAL COATINGS
AB Ag-TiO2 nano-composite coatings showed the synergistic effect on the anti-bacterial activity. However, little was known on the mechanism of the enhanced anti-bacterial effect. In this paper, a range of AgTiO2 nano-composited coating with different TiO2 contents were prepared on titanium substrate using an electroless deposition technique and the antibacterial performance of the coatings were evaluated with E. coli and S. aureus. This work demonstrated for the first time that the incorporation of TiO2 nano-particles into Ag matrix not only significantly promoted the Ag ion release, but also significantly increased the electron donor surface energy, which lead to the enhanced antibacterial effect of the AgTiO2 coatings.

TI Recycling of Cr/Ni/Cu plating wastes as black ceramic pigments
SO MATERIALS LETTERS

DT Article
DE Plating wastes; Ceramic pigment; Recycling; Circular economy
AB The non-ferrous metal industry, such as Cr/Ni/Cu plating, produces acid sludge which is usually neutralized with lime slurry in batch processes, and the resulting waste is dewatered by vacuum filtration or filter-pressing. Dewatered sludge contains calcium sulphate (CaSO4) coming from the neutralization process, as well as transition metals (Cr, Ni and Cu), oil, grease and suspended solids. In this communication, two residual sludges from Cr/Ni/Cu plating have been dried (110 degrees C) and fired (1100 degrees C), and both dried (gray coloured) and fired powders (black coloured) have been characterized by DTA-TG, XRD and SEMEDX techniques. XRD shows only quartz crystallization in dried samples, while NiCr2O4 chromite spinel and NiO periclase crystallize in fired powders, along with CaSO4 anhydrite and CaSiO3 wollastonite. The powders have been introduced as ceramic pigments into three different conventional glazes: a) a lead bisilicate (PbO.2SiO(2)) double fire frit (1000 degrees C), b) a double fire frit with low lead content (1000 degrees C), and c) a double fire frit without lead (1050 degrees C). Glazed samples were characterized by UV-Vis-NIR (diffuse reflectance) and CIEL/a/b/(color parameters). Dried powders induce glaze defects (pin-holing and crawling), but fired powders did not show these faults exhibiting more intense (higher L-*) and yellowish (higher b(*)) black colors than the standard spinel.

AB Using the co-precipitated Nd:YAG and YAG powders as raw materials, the Nd:YAG/YAG composite ceramics (Phi 50 mm x 5 mm) were prepared by vacuum sintering (1790 degrees C 50 h), followed by hot isostatic pressing (HIP) post treatment (1700 degrees C 2 h, 200 MPa Ar atmosphere) and air annealing (1250 degrees C 100 h). The optical properties of Nd:YAG/YAG samples were improved markedly by HIP post-treatment, mainly due to the elimination of residual pores in the samples. The composite sample showed a perfect bonding interface from Nd:YAG to YAG regions without obvious grain size difference, pores or other defects. This structure should be responsible for the thermal conductivity larger than that of non-composite sample. The composite sample revealed good optical properties with transmittance up to 83.9% at 1064 nm and 80.8% at 400 nm, and a maximum laser output power of 1.38 KW with the slope efficiency of 36.7% was obtained.

AB Copper (Cu) doped p-CdS nanoparticles have been synthesized via sol-gel method. The as-synthesized nano particles were successfully characterized and implemented for fabrication of Glass/ITO/n-ZnO/p-CdS/Al thin film photodiode. The fabricated device is tested for small (-1 V to + 1 V) bias voltage. Results verified that the junction leakage current within the dark is very small. During reverse bias condition, the maximum amount of photocurrent is obtained under illumination of 100 mu W/cm(2). Electrical characterizations confirmed that the external quantum efficiency (EQE), gain and responsivity of n-ZnO/p-CdS photodiode show improved photo response than conventional p-type materials for such a small bias voltage. It is therefore revealed that the Cu doped CdS nanoparticles is an efficient p-type material for fabrication of thin film photo-devices.

We have examined how different crystal field models are applied to solve the problems that arise in the spectroscopy of optically active ions. Attention is focused on the joint application of crystal field and density functional theory (DFT) based models, which takes advantages of strong features of both individual approaches and allows for obtaining a complementary picture of the electronic properties of a doped crystal with impurity energy levels superimposed onto the host band structure.

AB The effect of Zn substitution on the persistent luminescence properties of MgGeO3:Mn2+-Ln(3+) (Ln = Eu and Yb) red phosphors was investigated. The intensity of the persistent luminescence of the Eu3+ co-doped phosphors increased with increasing Zn content, whereas that of the Yb3+ co-doped samples decreased. For both series of lanthanide co-doped samples, the thermoluminescence (TL) glow peak shifted to the lower temperature side with increasing Zn content. These persistent luminescence properties were well explained in terms of lowering of the bottom of the conduction band relative to the ground state of the divalent lanthanide ions. Especially, in Eu3+ co-doped system, TL peak shifted from 520 K to 318 K by 50% Zn substitution. The persistent radiance of the (Mg-0.5 Zn-0.5)GeO3: Mn2+-Eu3+ sample at 1 h after ceasing UV light was 46 times stronger than that of MgGeO3:Mn2+-Eu3+, and 11 times stronger than that of ZnGa2O4: Cr3+ standard deep red persistent phosphor.

AB In this paper, temperature dependence of the emission maxima of Eu2+ and Ce3+-activated phosphors and various explanations for the thermal red-shift or blue-shift proposed by different authors are reviewed. Depending on the host lattice, doping concentration of Eu2+ or Ce3+, or the temperature range at which the PL spectrum was monitored, both the way and magnitude of emission spectrum shifting were quite different. Various explanations for the thermal shifts of the emission maxima were proposed. Nonetheless, a close inspection of a collection of the data indicates that some popular explanations seemingly plausible for the thermal red/blue-shifts of the emission maxima of Eu2+ and Ce3+-activated phosphors are highly questionable, because they either misused the Varshni equation or discussed the energy of the 5d-4f transitions of Eu2+ and Ce3+ in isolation without considering simultaneous change of the host lattice. An explanation of lattice dynamic induced thermal shifts of the emission maxima of Eu2+ and Ce3+-activated phosphors is proposed in this paper. By considering the dominant contribution to the energy of the 5d-4f transitions either from a lattice dilatation or from the interactions between the 5d electrons and phonons, the complex temperature dependences of the emission maxima of various Eu2+ and Ce3+-activated phosphors experimentally observed in literature could be explained reasonably.

AB In the present work, spindle-shaped ZnO and reduced graphene oxide sheets were successfully synthesized by a hydrothermal method and then ZnO/r-GO composite was prepared by a direct solution mixing method. Various characterization results confirmed the interior and surface decoration of spindle-shaped ZnO on the reduced graphene oxide sheets. The phase formation, crystalline structure, morphology, surface states and optical properties were characterized using Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), Transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) and UV-Vis spectroscopy. The X-ray diffraction analysis showed the formation of the hexagonal wurtzite crystalline structure of ZnO with high crystalline quality. The band gap of the ZnO/r-GO composite was found to be low (3.03eV) compared to the band gap of spindle shaped ZnO (3.13 eV), as calculated from optical studies. The spindle-like morphology of the single crystalline ZnO was clearly shown in the electron microscopic images. The chemical bonding and surface states of the samples were studied using XPS measurement. Moreover, a possible growth mechanism for the ZnO spindle was proposed. The catalytic activity of the as-synthesized samples was evaluated for the photodegradation of methylene blue under visible light irradiation. Among the synthesized samples, the ZnO/r-GO composite showed higher degradation efficiency of 93% and successfully reused for four consecutive run without any activity loss. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB In this Communication the behavior of two types of Gd3Al2Ga3O12:Ce samples under gamma and X-ray excitation is compared. Single crystals of GAGG:1%Ce have been grown by the Czochralski technique, while nanoceramic pills of GAGG:1%Ce have been fabricated by the LTHP sintering from nanocrystalline powders prepared by the Pechini method. The results of pulse height, scintillation time profile, radioluminescence as a function of temperature, and low temperature thermoluminescence measurements, are reported, indicating that monocrystals are still a better choice for scintillator application, nevertheless some of the properties of nano ceramics are indeed promising and there should be a room for improvement.

The addition of Cu2+ ions to Probe 1 shows distinct color change from light yellow to pinkish red color under visible light with the sensing limit of 1.54 mu M. Moreover, practical utility of Probe 1 as solid state optical sensor (test paper, TLC plates) for sensing Cu2+ has been demonstrated by instantaneous "naked eye" response.

AB Due to their very fast short-wavelength emission, neodymium-doped materials are a subject of current interest as potential scintillators. Although the initial reports regarding neodymium-doped orthophos-phates (in crystalline form) and their scintillation properties appeared almost twenty years ago, they remain an interesting class of materials since there is no in-depth understanding of their fundamental scintillation mechanism. In the present research, we focus on the crystalline systems: XPO4:Nd3+, where X = Y, Lu, La, Sc. The pulse height, optical absorption, radioluminescence and photoluminescence spectra were investigated and are reported here for various temperatures from 10 to 350 K. Additionally, results of both low and high temperature thermoluminescence measurements are reported in this communication. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Improving luminance efficiency and colour purity are the most important challenges for zinc oxide (ZnO)-organic hybrid heterojunction light emitting diodes (LEDs), affecting their large area applications. If ZnO-organic hybrid heterojunction white LEDs are fabricated by a hydrothermal method, it is difficult to obtain pure and stable blue emission from PFO due to the presence of an undesirable green emission. In this paper, we present an inverted-structure ZnO-organic hybrid heterojunction LED to avoid green emission from PFO, which mainly originates during device processing. With this configuration, each ZnO nanorod (NR) forms a discrete p-n junction; therefore, large-area white LEDs can be designed without compromising the junction area. The configuration used for this novel structure is glass/ZnO NRs/PFO/PEDOT:PSS/L-ITO, which enables the development of efficient, large-area and low-cost hybrid heterojunction LEDs. Inverted-structure ZnO-organic hybrid heterojunction white LEDs offer several improvements in terms of brightness, size, colour, external quantum efficiency and a wider applicability as compared to normal architecture LEDs.

AB Cadmium telluride (CdTe) quantum dots (QDs) were prepared from an aqueous solution containing CdCl2 and Te precursor in the presence of thioglycolic acid (TGA) or L-cysteine as capping agents. Two optical sensors have been developed for Hg2+ ions with very low concentration in the range of nanomolar (nM) or picomolar (pM) depending on the type of capping agents and based on photoluminescence (PL) quenching of CdTe QDs. It was observed that low concentrations of Hg2+ ions quench the fluorescence spectra of CdTe QDs and TGA capped CdTe QDs exhibited a linear response to He2+ ions in the concentration range from 1.25 to 10 nM. Moreover, it was found that L-cysteine capped CdTe QDs optical sensor with a sensitivity of 6 x 10(9) M-1, exhibited a linear coefficient of 0.99 and showed a detection limit of 2.7 pM in range from 5 to 25 pM of Hg2+ ions was achieved. In contrast to the significant response that was observed for Hg2+, a weak signal response was noted upon the addition of other metal ions indicating an excellent selectivity of CdTe QDs towards Hg2+.

ID HIGHLY BIREFRINGENT; POROUS FIBER; FABRICATION; DISPERSION
AB We present a Zeonex based highly birefringent and dispersion flattened porous core photonic crystal fiber (PC-PCF) for polarization preserving applications in the terahertz region. In order to facilitate birefringence, an array of elliptical shaped air holes surrounded by porous cladding is introduced. The porous cladding comprises circular air-holes in a modified hexagonal arrangement. The transmission characteristics of the proposed PCF are investigated using a full-vector finite element method with perfectly matched layer (PML) absorbing boundary conditions. Simulation results show a high birefringence of 0.086 and an ultra-flattened dispersion variation of +/- 0.03 ps/THz/cm at optimal design parameters. Besides, a number of other important wave-guiding properties including frequency dependence of the effective material loss (EML), confinement loss, and effective area are also investigated to assess the fiber's effectiveness as a terahertz waveguide.

AB The present article reports structural and spectroscopic properties of Tb:Bi2SiO5 nanophosphors dispersed in Polyvinylpyrrolidone polymer film, in presence of Salicylic acid (SA) molecule, which acts as a sensitizer. Detailed structural and spectroscopic characterizations were carried out using X-ray diffraction patterns, Scanning Electron Microscope, Fourier Transform Infrared and Excitation and photoluminescence techniques. The mean crystallite size of Tb3+:Bi2SiO5 nanophosphor and Tb3+:Bi2SiO5 in Polyvinylpyrrolidone polymer composite was estimated 22 tun and 28 nm, respectively. We have report atleast two times enhancement in Tb3+ ions emission intensity due to the efficient energy transfer from salicylic acid molecule to Tb ions. In addition to energy transfer from salicylic acid, the Polyvinylpyrrolidone polymeric host was also reported to serve as a sensitizer for SA molecule and Tb3+ ions through a cascade energy relaxation process while exciting with 248 nm photons. On 248 nm photon excitation, atleast five improvements in Tb3+ ion emission intensity are reported. Presence of SA molecule facilitates precise colour tuning as obvious from the CIE coordinates.

AB In this paper, counter electrodes based on carbon black (CB)-TiO2 composite are proposed as a cost-effective alternative to conventional Pt counter electrodes used in dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC) applications. CB-TiO2 composite counter electrodes with different weight percentages of CB were prepared using the solid state method and coated onto fluorine-doped tin oxide (PTO) glass using doctor blade method while Eleiodoxa conferta (E. conferta) and Nb-doped TiO2 were used as sensitizer and photoanode, respectively, with electrolyte containing I-/I-3(-) redox couple. The experimental results revealed that the CB-TiO2 composite influenced the photovoltaic performance by enhancing the electrocatalytic activity. As the amount of CB increased, the catalytic activity improved due to the increase in surface area which then led to low charge-transfer resistance (R-CT) at the electrolyte/CB electrode interface. Due to the use of the modified photoanode together with natural dye sensitizers, the counter electrode based on 15 wt% CB-TiO2 composite was able to produce the highest energy conversion efficiency (2.5%) making it a viable alternative counter electrode.

AB A new gel electrolyte comprising methylcellulose (MC), LiBOB and succinonitrile (SN) has been prepared with dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) as solvent. The electrolyte with composition 8.73 wt % MC-2.92 wt % LiBOB-1.01 wt % SN-87.34 wt % DMSO exhibits the highest conductivity of 1.18 mS cm(-1) at 25 degrees C. On partially substituting LiBOB with TMAI, the sample designated as TMAI 95 has the highest conducting composition of 8.70 wt % MC-0.14 wt % LiBOB-1.01 wt % SN-2.77 wt % TMAI-0.35 wt % I-2-87.03 wt % DMSO. The conductivity is 1.96 mS cm(-1). This sample is used to fabricate a dye sensitized photovoltaic cell that converts photons to electricity at an efficiency of 3.46%. The conductivity of this sample has been enhanced to 3.08 mS cm(-1) on addition of 1.0 wt % butyl-methyl immidazolium iodide (BMII) ionic liquid and the efficiency of the cell fabricated is 4.63%. Total replacement of LiBOB component in the electrolyte with the same amount of LiI results in a conductivity increase of similar to 23.5% and the DSSC exhibits a 5.72% efficiency.

AB The research on Nd3+ doped new solid-state laser hosts with specific thermo-mechanical and optical properties is very active. Nd3+ doped tellurite glasses are suitable for these applications. They have high linear and nonlinear refraction index, wide transmittance range. The TeO2-ZnO (TZO) glass considered in the present work combines all those features and the nonlinear optical properties can be used for the development of Kerr-lens mode-locked sub picosecond lasers. Recently the laser performance of Nd3+ doped TZO glass and was reported and laser slope efficiency of 21% was observed. We investigate how the intensity variation and the silver nanoparticles codoping affects the nonlinear optical properties of Nd3+ doped TZO glasses. Intensity dependent nonlinear refraction indices coefficients at 750, 800 and 850 nm were observed. The nonlinear optical features were obtained through ultrafast single beam z-scan technique with excitations at 750, 800 and 850 nm and are up to two orders of magnitude higher than those reported in the literature.

AB Branched beta-NaLuF4: Yb/Er was synthesized using a simple hydrothermal method by controlling the NaF/Ln molar ratio. In contrast to the beta-NaYF4: Yb/Er hexagonal disks, the branched beta-NaLuF4: Yb/Er has stronger emission intensity. The integrated intensities of green and red emission bands were as 6.2 and 3.3 times as that of NaYF4, respectively. The branched beta-NaLuF4: Yb/Er has the smaller unit cell volume, the higher absorption intensity around 980 nm and the lower crystal field symmetry than NaYF4, which made a significant contribution to the stronger upconversion (UC) fluorescence emissions. The results indicate that the branched beta-NaLuF4: Yb/Er is an excellent UC luminescence material. The current research has a great potential in improving near-infrared conversion efficiency of solar cells.

AB YAlO3 (YAP) single crystals doped with Lu and Nd were grown by the Floating Zone (FZ) method to evaluate their scintillation properties particularly emissions in the near-infrared (NIR) range. The Nd concentration was fixed to 0 or 1 mol% while the Lu concentration was varied from 0 to 30%. When X-ray was irradiated, the scintillation of Nd-doped samples was observed predominantly at 1064 nm due to F-4(3/2) -> I-4(11/2) transition of Nd3+. In contrast, a weak emission around 700 nm appeared in the samples doped with only Lu, and the emission origin was attributed to defect centers. In the Nd3+-doped samples, the decay time was 94-157 mu s due to the 4f-4f transitions of Nd3+ whereas the Lu-doped samples showed signal with the decay time of 1.45-1.54 ms. The emission origin of the latter signal was attributed to the perovskite lattice defect.

AB CuIn1-xGaxSe2 nanocrystals (CIGSe NCs) were synthesized with different gallium (Ga) content by the hot injection process at low reaction temperature for the first time. The Ga content [x = Ga(In + Ga)] was varied such as 0, 0.25, 0.50 and 0.75 to study their influences on the structural, morphological, compositional and optical properties of CIGSe NCs. X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis showed the peak shift towards higher 2 theta angle. The lattice parameters a and c were decreased linearly as x value increases which propitiated Vegard's law. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis revealed a decrease in the particle size from 55 to 22 nm. Ultraviolet-visible-near infrared (UV-vis-NIR) absorption spectra indicated a blue shift towards the lower wavelength and bandgap was tuned from 1.04 to 1.41eV. Apart from this, CIGSe thin films were prepared by doctor blade coating method followed by annealing under Se/Ar atmosphere. The mobility of CIGSe thin film increased whereas resistivity decreased. Moreover, the photoconductivity of CIGSe annealed thin film exhibited almost 2-fold increase under an illumination of light. We realize from these results that the synthesized CIGSe NCs with x = 0.25 is expected to have the important perspective to be efficiently exploited as an absorber layer in cost-effective thin film solar cells.

AB In order to complete the fluorescent labeling of SiO2 microspheres, a kind of di-functional ligand was synthesized and purified, which could not only coordinate rare earth ions but also react with the active groups to bond host materials with an alkoxysilane groups. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), H-1 NMR spectra, MS spectra, field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM), transmission electron microscope (TEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and luminescence spectrophotometer were used to study the structure of di-functional ligand and properties of fluorescent coupling agent and fluorescent labeled SiO2 microspheres. The optimal experiment conditions were acquired as follows: molar ratio as 1:4 (M-DBM: M-ICPTES), reaction time at 6 h and reaction temperature as 65 degrees C (yield up to 40%) through the orthogonal experiment and purification process. The results indicated that fluorescent coupling agent presented red photoluminesence of Eu3+ ions at 610 nm, and the absolute quantum yield was 11%. On the other hand, the hydrolysis of the coupling agent reacted on the surface of SiO2 microspheres and presented fluorescent labeling homogeneously.

ID SCHUMPETERIAN GROWTH THEORY; PATENTS
AB Mapping technologies into industries is frequently required in empirical innovation studies, but many concordances only provide coarse mappings. We develop a novel concordance between industries and technologies making use of linked inventor-employee data for a large sample of German patents filed at the European Patent Office between 1999 and 2011. Inventors listed on these patents are matched and disambiguated with German social security records. Employment data recorded in this database include detailed industry codes describing the industrial activities of the inventors' establishments. These linked microdata allow us to identify the precise industrial origin of inventions, combine them with technology classifications from the inventors' patents and to generate novel concordance tables. We evaluate our approach by comparing the concordances with existing work. Moreover, in an empirical application, we find that patent based indicators represent valid proxies for the innovation performance of industries and thus help to measure innovation in the absence of other survey based indicators. Service sector innovation activities, however, appear to be barely represented by the patenting activities of inventors and establishments.

AB We investigate whether having an advisor of the same gender is correlated with the productivity of PhD science students and their propensity to stay in academic science. Our analysis is based an original dataset - combined from dissertation abstracts, faculty directories and bibliometric data - covering nearly 20,000 PhD graduates and their advisors from U.S. chemistry departments. We find that students working with advisors of the same gender tend to be more productive during the PhD; and that female students working with female advisors are considerably more likely to become faculty themselves. We suggest that the under-representation of women in science and engineering faculty positions may perpetuate itself through the lower availability of same-gender advisors for female students.

AB Background: Achieving optimal control is the primary objective of asthma management. However, despite the existence of effective treatments, many patients experience periods of sub-optimal asthma control. The objective of this study was to quantify and project the future economic and health burden of sub-optimal asthma control in Canada.
   Methods: A probabilistic time-in-state model of asthma was created with inputs from published studies on the prevalence of asthma, levels of asthma control, and the impact of asthma control on costs and quality of life. In the primary analysis, we modeled the 20-year total direct costs (in 2014 Canadian dollars) and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) from 2014 to 2033 in Canada. In the secondary analysis, we also incorporated indirect costs.
   Results: The undiscounted projected 20-year direct costs and QALYs lost attributable to sub-optimal asthma control were $24.40 billion and 1.82 million, respectively, from 2014 to 2033. The corresponding discounted values (at 3%) were $18.54 billion and 1.38 million. When indirect costs were considered, the total undiscounted and discounted costs of sub-optimal control were projected to be $280.49 billion, and $213.10 billion, respectively. A 10% reduction in prevalence of sub-optimal control in asthma was associated with 18% reduction in the economic and health burden of asthma over this time period.
   Discussion: Sub-optimal asthma control is associated with a substantial economic and health burden. Given that with evidence-based disease management asthma can be controlled in the majority of patients, strategies towards improving asthma management can be associated with a significant return on investment.

AB Background: Asthma severity can be affected by microbial exposures. However, less is known about the specific indoor agents aggravating the disease in children. We examined the associations between indoor endotoxin and beta-(1 -> 3)-D-glucan exposures and asthma severity in children with asthma.
   Methods: A clinical cross-sectional study of schoolchildren (aged 7-17 years) was conducted in the province of Saskatchewan, Canada. Children with asthma (n = 116) were identified from 335 participants using a combination of survey responses and objective clinical assessments. We then ascertained asthma severity based on recommended guidelines (continuous daytime asthma symptoms, frequent nighttime asthma symptoms, and <= 60% predicted FEV1). Levels of indoor endotoxin and beta-(1 -> 3)-D-glucan were measured in dust samples obtained from play area floors and child's mattresses.
   Results: The study population of 116 children with asthma was comprised of 75.9% mild asthma and 24.1% moderate/severe asthma. Higher mattress endotoxin concentration was associated with increased odds of moderate/severe asthma [adjusted odds ratio (aOR) = 11.40, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.45-89.43] while higher beta-(1 -> 3)-D-glucan concentration (aOR = 0.16, 95% CI: 0.03-0.89) and load (aOR = 0.10, 95% CI: 0.02-0.72) in play areas were inversely associated with moderate/severe asthma. Furthermore, higher mattress endotoxin concentration was associated with lower FVC (p = 0.01) and FEV1 (p = 0.03). These associations were not seen for beta-(1 -> 3)-D-glucan.
   Conclusion: Our results showed differential effects of microbial exposures on childhood asthma severity and further highlight domestic endotoxin exposure effects on respiratory health outcomes in children with asthma.

   TIME-COURSE; EXACERBATIONS; IMPACT; RECOVERY; OUTCOMES
AB Background: Timely diagnosis of acute exacerbations of COPD (AECOPD) is challenging as it depends on patients' reports. AECOPD are characterised by increased airway obstruction, mucus and air trapping, which results in changes in lung acoustics. Thus, adventitious respiratory sounds (ARS) may be useful to detect/monitor AECOPD.
   Objective: To evaluate computerised ARS changes during AECOPD.
   Methods: 25 non-hospitalised patients with AECOPD (16 male, 70 [62.5-77.0] yrs, FEV1 59 [31.5-73.0]%predicted) and 34 healthy volunteers (17 male, 63.5 [57.7-72.3] yrs, FEV1 103.0 [88.8-125.3]%predicted) were enrolled. ARS at anterior and posterior right and left chest were recorded at hospital presentation (T1), 15 days (T2) and 45 days (T3) after hospital presentation from patients with AECOPD and only once from healthy participants. A subsample of 9 patients (7 male; 66 [60.0-76.0] yrs; FEV1 62 [26.5-74.0]% predicted) was also included to study ARS pre-AECOPD (T0). Number of crackles and wheeze occupation rate (% Wh) were processed using validated algorithms.
   Results: During AECOPD, patients presented more inspiratory crackles at T1 than T3 (p= 0.013) and more inspiratory % Wh at T1 than T2 (p= 0.006), at posterior chest. Patients with stable COPD presented more inspiratory crackles (p= 0.012), at posterior chest, and more expiratory %Wh, both at anterior (p < 0.001) and posterior (p= 0.001) chest, than healthy participants. No differences were observed for the remaining ARS parameters or subsamples (p > 0.05).
   Conclusions: Inspiratory crackles seem to persist until 15 days post exacerbation whilst inspiratory %Wh decreased after this period. ARS seem to be sensitive to monitor AECOPD. This information may allow advances in monitoring the recovery time of patients with AECOPD across all clinical and non-clinical settings.

AB Objectives: This study compared the efficacy, pharmacokinetics (PK), and safety of GFF MDI (Bevespi Aerosphere (R)), a fixed-dose combination of glycopyrronium and formoterol fumarate dihydrate (14.4/10 mu g) delivered by a metered dose inhaler (MDI) formulated using innovative co-suspension delivery technology, in patients with moderate-to-very severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) with and without the Aerochamber Plus (R) Flow-Vu (R) valved holding chamber (VHC).
   Methods: In this multicenter, open-label, crossover, Phase III study (NCT02454959), patients were randomized to receive GFF MDI 14.4/10 mu g (equivalent to glycopyrrolate/formoterol fumarate 18/9.6 mu g) twice daily for 7 days with and without the VHC. The primary endpoint was forced expiratory volume in 1 s area under the curve from 0 to 12 h (FEV1 AUC(0-12)) on Day 8. Steady state PK parameters for glycopyrronium and formoterol (AUC(0-12), peak concentration [C-max] and time to peak concentration [t(max)]) were estimated from 12-h plasma concentration time data on Day 8. Safety and tolerability were also assessed throughout.
   Results: Eighty patients were randomized. On Day 8, the ratio (90% confidence interval [CI]) of least squares mean (LSM) FEV1 AUC(0-12) for GFF MDI with VHC (LSM = 1538 mL; n = 67) versus without VHC (LSM = 1516 mL; n = 68) was 101.4% (100.1, 102.7). PK parameters were comparable overall with a slightly higher exposure to glycopyrronium with the VHC. The AUC(0-12) geometric LSM ratio (90% CI) for GFF MDI with versus without VHC was 115.99% (99.74, 134.89) for glycopyrronium and 96.66% (86.69, 107.78) for formoterol. GFF MDI with and without VHC were well tolerated with a similar adverse event profile.
   Conclusions: The magnitude of bronchodilatory effect was similar with and without a VHC following GFF MDI treatment. This, together with the PK and safety profiles, supports the use of the VHC with GFF MDI for the maintenance treatment of COPD, which could be particularly useful for patients who have difficulty with the coordination of an MDI.

   FEATURES; SURVIVAL; ENTITY
AB BACKGROUND: Pleuroparenchymal fibroelastosis (PPFE) has been described in hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP) yet its functional implications are unclear. Combined pulmonary fibrosis and emphysema (CPFE) has occasionally been described in never-smokers with HP, but epidemiological data regarding its prevalence is sparse. CTs in a large HP cohort were therefore examined to identify the prevalence and effects of PPFE and emphysema.
   Methods: 233 HP patients had CT extents of interstitial lung disease (ILD) and emphysema quantified to the nearest 5%. Lobar percentage pleural involvement of PPFE was quantified on a 4-point categorical scale: 0 = absent, 1 = affecting < 10%, 2 = affecting 10-33%, 3 = affecting > 33%. Marked PPFE reflected a total lung score of >= 3/18. Results were evaluated against FVC, DLco and mortality.
   RESULTS: Marked PPFE prevalence was 23% whilst 23% of never-smokers had emphysema. Following adjustment for patient age, gender, smoking status, and ILD and emphysema extents, marked PPFE independently linked to reduced baseline FVC (p = 0.0002) and DLco (p = 0.002) and when examined alongside the same covariates, independently linked to worsened survival (p = 0.01).
   CPFE in HP demonstrated a characteristic functional profile of artificial lung volume preservation and disproportionate DLco reduction. CPFE did not demonstrate a worsened outcome when compared to HP patients without emphysema beyond that explained by CT extents of ILD and emphysema.
   CONCLUSIONS: PPFE is not uncommon in HP, and is independently associated with impaired lung function and increased mortality. Emphysema was identified in 23% of HP never-smokers. CPFE appears not to link to a malignant microvascular phenotype as outcome is explained by ILD and emphysema extents.

AB Background: Fatigue is a major and disabling problem in sarcoidosis. Knowledge concerning correlates of the development of fatigue and possible interrelationships is lacking. Objective: A conceptual model of fatigue was developed and tested.
   Methods: Sarcoidosis outpatients (n = 292) of Maastricht University Medical Center completed questionnaires regarding trait anxiety, depressive symptoms, cognitive failure, dyspnea, social support, and small fiber neuropathy (SFN) at baseline. Fatigue was assessed at 6 and 12 months. Sex, age, and time since diagnosis were taken from medical records. Pathways were estimated by means of path analyses in AMOS.
   Results: Everyday cognitive failure, depressive symptoms, symptoms suggestive of SFN, and dyspnea were positive predictors of fatigue. Fit indices of the model were good.
   Conclusions: The model validly explains variation in fatigue. Everyday cognitive failure and depressive symptoms were the most important predictors of fatigue. In addition to physical functioning, cognitive and psychological aspects should be included in the management of sarcoidosis patients.

AB Background: Neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) is a glycoprotein that is involved in the innate immune system and increased expression has been detected in diverse diseases. Sarcoidosis is a systemic granulomatous disorder and its clinical course and prognosis are changeable and highly divergent. This study aimed to examine the expression of NGAL in patients with sarcoidosis. In addition, we examined whether NGAL could serve as a marker of disease activity and prognosis.
   Methods: Ninety-six sarcoidosis patients were studied. Serum samples collected at the time of diagnosis were examined for NGAL by cellular enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The level of NGAL was compared with clinical, radiological and laboratory data.
   Results: Patients with sarcoidosis had significantly higher levels of NGAL (the median [interquartile range] was 35.1 ng/mL [23.5-60.8] in sarcoidosis patients versus 17.2 ng/mL [13.0-27.0] in the reference population, p < .0001). NGAL levels were not correlated with markers for disease activity. During the follow-up period, 26 patients (27.1%) deteriorated and received systemic corticosteroid therapy for organ dysfunction. In those patients, NGAL levels were significantly higher than in those who did not receive corticosteroid therapy (56.5 ng/mL [27.3-92.3] versus 34.3 ng/mL [23.0-53.0], p = .0201). Upon multivariate logistic regression analysis, elevated NGAL levels at diagnosis were associated with subsequent use of systemic corticosteroid therapy (hazard ratio, 1.20; 95% confidence interval, 1.09-1.31; p = .0004).
   Conclusion: NGAL may be a useful marker to predict the disease course of sarcoidosis.

AB Objective: Untreated obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease including myocardial infarction (MI), congestive heart failure (CHF), and atrial fibrillation (AF). Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is an effective treatment for OSA; however, compliance with CPAP can be challenging for some patients. The objective of this study was to investigate whether uvulopalatopharyngoplasty (UPPP) reduced the risk of cardiovascular complications for patients with OSA.& para;& para;Methods: Data from Korea National Health Insurance Corporation, a national health care database in South Korea, were analyzed. All patients with a new diagnosis of OSA from 2007 to 2014 were identified. Propensity score matching by age and sex was used to identify a control group five times larger than the OSA group for comparison. Patient demographics and comorbidities were collected. The OSA group was further divided into patients who had an UPPP and patients who did not undergo surgery. The primary endpoints were newly diagnosed MI, CHF, and AF.& para;& para;Results: Of 192,316 patients with a new diagnosis of OSA, 22,213 had undergone UPPP. For the control group, 961,590 individuals were selected. Patients with OSA had an increased risk of CHF and AF, compared to control patients. UPPP reduced the incidence of CHF and AF significantly. Age, gender, and hypertension were also found to be risk factors for cardiac complications for patients with OSA.& para;& para;Conclusion: OSA increases the risk of CHF and AF. UPPP in this population can significantly reduce the risk of cardiac complications in patients with OSA. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Background: Current sleep medicine nosology places increased importance on nocturnal polysomnographic sleep recordings in the diagnosis of central nervous system disorders of hypersomnolence, particularly idiopathic hypersomnia (IH).
   Objective: Determine what differences in sleep staging and architecture exist between IH and healthy controls using meta-analysis.
   Methods: Systematic review identified relevant studies that included nocturnal polysomnography data for IH and healthy control groups. Meta-analysis compared standardized mean differences (Hedge's g) for total sleep time (TST), sleep onset latency (SOL), sleep efficiency (SE), rapid eye movement (REM) sleep percentage, slow wave sleep (SWS) percentage, and REM latency (REML). Moderator analyses were also conducted for variables with significant heterogeneity among studies.
   Results: The meta-analysis included 10 studies. Relative to controls, IH demonstrated increased TST (pooled g = 0.92; 95% CI: 0.46 to 1.38, p < 0.0001) and REM percentage (pooled g = 0.36, 95% CI: 0.09 to 0.64, p = 0.01), decreased SOL (pooled g = -0.46; 95% CI: -0.81 to -0.12, p = 0.009) and SWS percentage (pooled g = -0.28, 95% CI: -0.50 to -0.07, p = 0.01), without significant differences in SE (pooled g = 0.03; 95% CI: -0.32 to 0.38, p = 0.86) or REML (pooled g = 0.14, 95% CI: -0.21 to 0.49, p = 0.42). Moderator analysis demonstrated a significant effect of sex on SE, with a higher proportion of women to men significantly predicting lower SE between in IH and controls (p < 0.0001).
   Conclusions: IH is associated with several changes in sleep staging and architecture relative to healthy persons, including alterations in REM and SWS not currently delineated in nosological constructs. Further research is indicated to clarify how these findings are related the pathophysiology of IH and related disorders. (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Objective: To assess the efficacy and tolerability of trazodone compared with placebo in patients with insomnia.& para;& para;Methods: Electronic databases were searched and relevant reports were hand-screened to identify eligible trials. Only randomized placebo-controlled trials were included. Standardized mean differences (SMD) and the odds ratios (OR) were estimated using a random-effect model. Primary efficacy outcomes included sleep efficiency (SE%) and self-reported sleep quality (SQ). Secondary efficacy outcomes included sleep latency (SL), total sleep time (TST), the number of awakenings (NAs), waking time after sleep onset (WASO). Tolerability outcome was measured by the number of patients who discontinued for adverse events and acceptability outcome was measured by the number of patients who discontinued for all causes.& para;& para;Results: Seven trials involving 429 patients were included. There was no significant improvement for trazodone in SE% (SMD = 0.09, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.19 to 0.38, P = 0.53) with a non-significant heterogeneity (I-2 = 0%, P = 0.59). However, patients receiving trazodone perceived better SQ than those receiving the placebo (SMD = -0.41, 95% CI -0.82 to -0.00, P = 0.05) with a non-significantly moderate heterogeneity (I-2 = 65%, P = 0.06). As to secondary efficacy outcomes, we only found a significant reduction for trazodone in NAs (SMD = -0.51, 95% CI -0.97 to -0.05) compared to the placebo, with nonsignificant differences found in SL, TST, or WASO between trazodone and placebo. Moreover, no significant difference was found in the outcome of tolerability or acceptability.& para;& para;Conclusions: Trazodone was effective in sleep maintenance by decreasing the number of early awakenings and it could significantly improve perceived sleep quality, although there were no significant improvements in sleep efficiency or other objective measures. Trazodone however, presented good tolerance in the short-term treatment of insomnia. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Objective: Familial dysautonomia (FD) is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by impaired development of sensory and afferent autonomic nerves. Untreated sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) has been reported to increase the risk of sudden unexpected death in FD. We aimed to describe the prevalence and characteristics of SDB in FD.& para;& para;Patients/Methods: Seventy-five patients with FD (20 adults and 55 children) underwent in-lab poly-somnography, including peripheral capillary oxygen saturation (SpO(2) ) and end-tidal capnography (EtCO2) measurements. A t-test and Spearman's correlation analysis were performed to evaluate the impact of age on sleep, occurrence of apneas, SpO(2) and EtCO2 levels; and to determine the relationship between apneas and SpO(2) /EtCO2 measurements during different sleep stages.& para;& para;Results: Overall, 85% of adults and 91% of pediatric patients had some degree of SDB. Obstructive sleep apneas were more severe in adults (8.5 events/h in adults vs. 3.5 events/h in children, p = 0.04), whereas central apneas were more severe (10.8 vs. 2.8 events/h, p = 0.04) and frequent (61.8% vs. 45%, p = 0.017) in children. Overall, a higher apnea-hypopnea index was associated with increased severity of hypoxia and hypoventilation, although in a significant fraction of patients (67% and 46%), hypoxemia and hypoventilation occurred independent of apneas.& para;& para;Conclusion: Most adult and pediatric patients with FD suffer from some degree of SDB. There was a differential effect of age in the pattern of SDB observed. In some FD patients, hypoventilation and hypoxia occurred independently of apneas. Therefore, we recommend including EtCO 2 monitoring during poly-somnography in all patients with FD to detect SDB. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Background: Repetitive thought is a hallmark of several psychopathological conditions and in particular a perpetuating and maintaining factor in Insomnia Disorder. Accordingly, one of the primary complaints reported by Insomnia patients is the inability to shut-off or control thoughts. Worry and rumination are the two best-known styles of repetitive thought leading to sleep disturbances. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship of these two cognitive processes on nocturnal sleep indices objectively recorded by polysomnography.& para;& para;Methods: 27 Insomnia patients and 20 healthy controls matched for sex and age were recruited and completed a comprehensive assessment aimed to evaluate sleep quality, excessive daytime sleepiness, insomnia severity, worry, rumination, depressive and anxious symptomatology, and the ability to produce reasonable cognitive estimates. Sleep diaries indices and polysomnographic recordings were evaluated.& para;& para;Results: Insomnia patients showed increased levels of worry and rumination in comparison to controls. Our polysomnographic study revealed that these two different types of repetitive thoughts were significantly associated with objective sleep variables. In particular, heightened worry levels were related to an augmented wake after sleep onset and diminished total sleep time, sleep efficiency and percentage of REM sleep, whereas rumination was associated with an increase of sleep latency and a decrement of sleep efficiency. However, after controlling for anxiety and depressive symptoms only worry maintained a significant relationship with polysomnographic variables. Remarkably, repetitive thoughts did not correlate with microstructural REM sleep features and quantitative EEG analysis.& para;& para;Conclusion: Our study indicates the existence of a significant relationship between daytime levels of repetitive thought and sleep, thus corroborating the hypothesis of an interplay between cognitive and nocturnal electrophysiological activity in insomniacs.

AB Background: Nocturia is highly prevalent in subjects with respiratory sleep disturbances (ie obstructive sleep apnea). The aim of our study is to evaluate whether nocturia is associated with intermittent desaturations or hypoxia length and severity in people undergoing polysomnography. & para;& para;Methods: We recruited 275 consecutive subjects attending the outpatient clinic for respiratory diseases at Campus Bio-Medico Teaching Hospital. Nocturia was defined as a self-reported voiding frequency >= two per night. The groups with and without nocturia were compared with parametric and non-parametric tests, as appropriated. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to assess the association of nocturia with patients' characteristics, including oxygen desaturation index (ODI), respiratory efforts (RE) and oxygen saturation below 90% (TST90). & para;& para;Results: Sixty-six (24%) subjects reported nocturia, the median ODI was 15 (8-31), the median RE was 22 (12-38) and the median TST90 was 4.7 (0.3-20.6). ODI and RE were significantly higher in subjects with nocturia as compared with controls. In the multivariable model, ODI was associated with an increased probability of nocturia (OR = 1.03; 95% CI = 1.01-1.06), and the higher the ODI score, the higher the probability to have nocturia (P for trend = 0.038). No significant association was found between TST90 and the occurrence of nocturia.& para;& para;Conclusions: Intermittent desaturations and not hypoxia length and severity, expressed by TST90 , are associated with the occurrence of nocturia in subjects complaining sleep disturbances.

AB Background: Poor sleep is one of the most common problems reported during menopause, and is known to vary throughout the menopause transition. The objective of this study was to describe the dynamics of poor sleep among participants of the Midlife Women's Health Study and to identify risk factors associated with poor sleep during the menopausal transition.& para;& para;Methods: Annual responses to surveys that included questions about the frequency of sleep disturbances and insomnia were analyzed to determine the likelihood of persistent poor sleep throughout the menopausal transition and the correlation of responses to the different sleep-related questions, including frequency of restless sleep during the first year of the study. Responses to questions about a large number of potential risk factors were used to identify risk factors for poor sleep. & para;& para;Results: Poor sleep in premenopause was not predictive of poor sleep in perimenopause, and poor sleep in perimenopause was not predictive of poor sleep in postmenopause. Frequencies of each of the measures of poor sleep were highly correlated. For all sleep outcomes, high frequency of depression was related to a high frequency of poor sleep. Vasomotor symptoms were also significantly related with a higher frequency of all poor sleep outcomes. A history of smoking was also associated with higher frequencies of insomnia and sleep disturbances.& para;& para;Conclusions: The risk factors identified for poor sleep, depression and vasomotor symptoms, were consistently associated with poor sleep throughout the menopausal transition. The likelihood of these risk factors changed from premenopause, through perimenopause, and into postmenopause, however, which could explain changes in sleep difficulties across the menopausal transition. Treatment of these risk factors should be considered when addressing sleep difficulties in menopausal women.(C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Objective: The hubs of the brain network play a key role in integrating and transferring information between different functional modules. However, whether the changed pattern in functional network hubs contributes to the onset of leg discomfort symptoms in restless legs syndrome (RLS) patients remains unclear. Using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) and graph theory methods, we investigated whether alterations of hubs can be detected in RLS.& para;& para;Methods: First, we constructed the whole-brain voxelwise functional connectivity and calculated a functional connectivity strength (FCS) map in each of 16 drug-naive idiopathic RLS patients and 26 gender- and age-matched healthy control (HC) subjects. Next, a two-sample t test was applied to compare the FCS maps between HC and RLS patients, and to identify significant changes in FCS in RLS patients. To further elucidate the corresponding changes in the functional connectivity patterns of the aberrant hubs in RLS patients, whole-brain resting-state functional connectivity analyses for the hub areas were performed.& para;& para;Results: The hub analysis revealed decreased FCS in the cuneus, fusiform gyms, paracentral lobe, and precuneus, and increased FCS in the superior frontal gyms and thalamus in idiopathic drug-naive RLS patients. Subsequent functional connectivity analyses revealed decreased functional connectivity in sensorimotor and visual processing networks and increased functional connectivity in the affective cognitive network and cerebellar-thalamic circuit. Furthermore, the mean FCS value in the superior frontal gyms was significantly correlated with Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale scores in RLS patients, and the mean FCS value in the fusiform gyms was significantly correlated with Hamilton Depression Rating Scale scores.& para;& para;Conclusions: These findings may provide novel insight into the pathophysiology of RLS.

AB The chemical composition of snake venoms is a complex mixture of proteins and peptides that can be pharmacologically active. Crotamine, a cell-penetrating peptide, has been described to have antimicrobial properties and it exerts its effects by interacting selectively with different structures, inducing changes in the ion flow pattern and cellular responses. However, its real therapeutic potential is not yet fully known. Bearing in mind that crotamine is a promising molecule in therapeutics, this study investigated the action of purified molecule in three aspects: I) antibacterial action on different species of clinical interest, II) the effect of two different concentrations of the molecule on platelet aggregation, and III) its effects on isolated mitochondria. Crotamine was purified to homogeneity in a single step procedure using Heparin Sepharose. The molecular mass of the purified enzyme was 4881.4 Da, as determined by mass spectrometry. To assess antibacterial action, changes in the parameters of bacterial oxidative stress were determined. The peptide showed antibacterial activity on Escherichia coli (MIC: 2.0 mu g/mu L), Staphylococcus aureus (MIC: 8-16 mu g/mu L) and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MIC: 4.0-8.0 mu g/mu L), inducing bacterial death by lipid peroxidation and oxidation of target proteins, determined by thiobarbituric acid reactive substances and sulfhydryl groups, respectively. Crotamine induced increased platelet aggregation (IPA) at the two concentrations analyzed (0.1 and 1.4 mu g/mu L) compared to ADP-induced aggregation of PRP. Mitochondrial respiratory parameters and organelle structure assays were used to elucidate the action of the compound in this organelle. The exposure of mitochondria to crotamine caused a decrease in oxidative phosphorylation and changes in mitochondrial permeability, without causing damage in the mitochondrial redox state. Together, these results support the hypothesis that, besides the antimicrobial potential, crotamine acts on different molecular targets, inducing platelet aggregation and mitochondrial dysfunction.

AB Aflatoxin (AFB) is one of the most toxic fungal metabolites produced by Aspergillus flavus, which may contaminate food and agricultural products. Herein, an aptamer-based surface plasmon resonance (SPR) biosensor was developed to detect AFBs. The chosen aptamer showed comparable interaction with the two AFBs, namely aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) and aflatoxin B2 (AFB2). Such phenomenon was rarely reported, and might lead to a simultaneous detection of both AFBs. In this study, AFB1 was used to systematically establish the detection method. In the SPR system, streptavidin proteins were immobilized on the surface of a CM5 sensor chip as a cross-linker and biotin-aptamers were captured through streptavidin-biotin interaction. After optimization, the assay showed a dynamic range between 0.09 and 200 ng mL(-1) (linear range from 1.5 to 50 ng mL(-1) and a LOD of 0.19 ng mL(-1)) of AFB1 in buffer. As expected, the aptasensor showed high specificity towards AFB1 and AFB2, but hardly bound to other toxins with similar structures, including ochratoxin A (OTA), ochratoxin B (OTB), Zeralenone (ZEA) and T-2 toxin (T-2). Determination of AFB1 in vinegar was further performed using the SPR biosensor. Recoveries of AFB1 from spiked samples ranged from 96.3 to 117.8%. The developed SPR assay is a simple, fast and sensitive approach for the detection of residual AFBs in agricultural products and foodstuffs like vinegar. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB A multimycotoxin analysis approach in grains results in frequent simultaneous findings of nephrotoxic mycotoxins ochratoxin A (OTA) and citrinin (CTN). The mechanism of CTN and OTA toxicities in biological systems is not fully understood but it is known that oxidative stress is involved. In this study, oxidative damage of DNA, lipids, and the concentration of glutathione (GSH), as well as possible antioxidative effects of resveratrol (RSV) were studied in vivo. Male adult Wistar rats were treated orally with OTA (0.125 and 0.250 mg kg(-1) b.w.), RSV (20 mg k(-1) b.w.) for 21 days, CTN (20 mg kg(-1) b.w.) for two days or with their combinations. The hOGG1 modified comet assay revealed kidneys and liver oxidative DNA damage in OTA + CTN treated animals, which was not reversed by RSV. CTN did not reduce glutathione (GSH) or increase malondialdehyde (MDA) concentration in any tissue, while OTA reduced kidneys GSH and increased kidneys and liver MDA. RSV increased GSH concentrations in all tissues and decreased MDA concentration in the liver only. Oxidative stress is involved in the toxicity of OTA and CTN but it seems that it differs significantly in organs. Most of the effects on GSH and MDA in combined toxicity may be attributed to the toxic effects of OTA. RSV was effective in restoring the depleted GSH in all tissues but had no effect on the MDA concentration and DNA damage. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The preclinical evaluation of the neutralizing efficacy of antivenoms is mandatory before a product is introduced for clinical use. The World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines for antivenoms categorize the tests used in preclinical studies as 'essential assay' (neutralization of lethality) and 'additional recommended assays' (neutralization of other relevant toxic activities). The present review presents an overview of the methodological aspects of snake antivenom preclinical efficacy tests, and summarizes the studies performed in this subject on antivenoms used in Latin America and the Caribbean. General trends emerging from this analysis show that: (a) Bothrops antivenoms have a broad spectrum of neutralizing efficacy against venoms of snakes of the genera Agkistrodon, Atropoides, Bothriechis, Bothrops, Cerrophidion, and Porthidium. (b) Crotalus antivenoms show a dichotomic pattern of efficacy depending on whether the venoms used for immunization are crotoxin-rich or metalloproteinase-rich. (c) A complete neutralization of Lachesis sp venoms is achieved only by antivenoms that include Lachesis sp venoms in the immunizing mixture. (d) Micrurus sp venoms have a high immunological heterogeneity which impacts in the cross-neutralization by available antivenoms. There is a need to further expand the knowledge base of the preclinical efficacy of antivenoms in Latin America and the Caribbean. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Antibody technologies are being increasingly applied in the field of toxinology. Fuelled by the many advances in immunology, synthetic biology, and antibody research, different approaches and antibody formats are being investigated for the ability to neutralize animal toxins. These different molecular formats each have their own therapeutic characteristics. In this review, we provide an overview of the advances made in the development of toxin-targeting antibodies, and discuss the benefits and drawbacks of different antibody formats in relation to their ability to neutralize toxins, pharmacokinetic features, propensity to cause adverse reactions, formulation, and expression for research and development (R&D) purposes and large-scale manufacturing. A research trend seems to be emerging towards the use of human antibody formats as well as camelid heavy-domain antibody fragments due to their compatibility with the human immune system, beneficial therapeutic properties, and the ability to manufacture these molecules cost-effectively.

AB Development of a selective adsorbent with an enhanced removal efficiency for phosphate from wastewater is urgently needed. Here, a hybrid adsorbent of nanoscale zirconium molybdate embedded in a macroporous anion exchange resin (ZMAE) is proposed for the selective removal of phosphate. The ZMAE consists of a low agglomeration of zirconium molybdate nanoparticles (ZM NPs) dispersed within the structure of the anion exchange (AE) resin: As major results, the phosphate adsorption capacity of the ZMAE (26.1 mg-P/g) in the presence of excess sulfate (5 mM) is superior to that of the pristine AE resin (1.8 mg-P/g) although their phosphate uptake capacity was similar in the absence of sulfate and these results were supported by the high selectivity coefficient of the ZMAE toward phosphate over sulfate (S-PO4/SO4) more than 100 times compared to the pristine AE resin. This superior selective performance of the ZMAE for phosphate in the presence of sulfate ions is well explained by the role of the ZM NPs that contributed to 69% of the phosphate capacity which is based on an observation that the phosphate adsorption capacity of the ZM NPs is not affected by the presence of sulfate. In addition, the behavior of the selective phosphate removal by the ZMAE was well demonstrated by not only in the batch mode experiment with simulated Mekong river water and representative wastewater effluent but also in a column test.

AB Iron redox cycle plays a primary role in controlling the mobility of P in sediments. It is crucial to better understand how lanthanum (La) modified bentonite (LMB, Phoslock (R)), an increasingly employed capping agent, immobilizes P from sediments by altering Fe redox-coupled P cycling. Batch adsorption experiments found that LMB effectively adsorbed Fe(II) with a capacity of 8.51 mg g(-1). Fe(II)-preloaded LMB effectively retained P during a 518-hour equilibration, while up to 16.7% of adsorbed P was release-sensitive in LMB without Fe(II) preloading. A 60-day incubation experiment was performed using sediment cores, with an LMB amendment dosage of up to 200 LMB/P-mob (w/w, P-mob denotes the amount of mobile P in the surface 40 mm sediment layer). The concentrations of pore water soluble reactive P (SRP) and labile P were measured by high resolution dialysis (HR-Peeper) and by diffusive gradient in thin films (DGT), respectively, at a vertical millimeter scale. They stratified into static layers with extremely low concentration distribution in the top 16-22 mm sediments (mean SRP <= 0.28 mg L-1 and mean DGT-labile P <= 0.051 mg L-1) and active layers with decreased upward diffusion potential (<= 5.85 for SRP and <= 12.7 for DGT-labile P) below the static layer, when the applied dosage reached 60 LMB/P-mob. The LMB amendment reduced the pore water Fe and DGT-labile Fe in sediments, while considerable amounts of Fe and Fe-bound P existed in the LMB binding layer (25% of the total P in 200 LMB/P-mob treatment). These findings show that the adsorption of Fe by LMB plays a significant role in the stabilization of LMB-bound P, possibly by adsorbing release-sensitive P initially bound to the rhabdophane surface. LMB adsorbed Fe and P were not released until the redox potential decreased to extremely reductive conditions (-150 mV to -300 mV), possibly due to the re-adsorption of Fe and P by LMB. This study reveals synergistic effects of Fe adsorption and provides new insight into the immobilization mechanisms of P by LMB application. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Different conductive materials have been employed to stimulate direct interspecies electron transfer (DIET) during methanogenesis, but few studies have been concerned with the interaction between conductive materials and extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) such as the effect on sludge aggregation and redox activity of EPS. This study aims to systematically investigate the role of red mud with 45.46 wt% hematite on methanogenesis during the anaerobic digestion of waste activated sludge. The results showed that the multivalent cations from hematite effectively promoted the formation of large and compact aggregates, which might contribute to the rapid direct electron exchange during the DIET process. Meanwhile,, more redox-active mediators, including c-type cytochromes (c-Cyts) and humic substances, particularly in tight-bound EPS (TB-EPS), and more redox-active metals such as Fe introduced by red mud could take part in the interspecies electron transfer process between syntrophic bacteria and methanogenic archaea, which also promoted methane production (35.52 +/- 2.64% increase compared with the control). This study provided initial scientific evidence to comprehensively assess the role of conductive materials during methanogenesis, with important implications for the biogeochemical redox processes of conductive minerals in natural and engineered environments.

TI Unraveling the catalyzing behaviors of different iron species (Fe2+ vs.

AB Dewatering of waste'activated sludge (WAS) is of major interest in its volume reduction, transportation and ultimate disposal. Persulfate-based oxidation process is a newly developed option for enhancing WAS dewaterability through the generation of powerful sulfate radicals (SO4-). However, the enhancement in WAS dewaterability by persulfate differs with the species of iron catalysts used. In this study, two types of iron catalysts (i.e. Fe2+ vs. Fe) were employed to initiate the persulfate (S2O82-), and the catalyzing behaviors and the underlying principles in enhancing WAS dewaterability were investigated and compared. The Fe2+ exhibited the high effectiveness in catalyzing the decomposition of persulfate to sulfate radicals (SO4-), inducing the greater improvement in WAS dewatering. The WAS dewaterability (indicated by dry solids content after filtration) increased with the added S2O82-/Fe2+ dosages, with the dry solids content reaching up to 5.1 0.8 wt% at S2O82-/Fe2+ dosages of 1.2/1.5 mmol/g-VS after only 30 s' filtration, roughly 1.8-fold increase than raw WAS (1.8 +/- 0.1 wt%). In contrast, the influence of the persulfate oxidation when activated with Fe on WAS dewaterability was statistically insignificant. The WAS dewaterability remained nearly unchanged (i.e. dry solids content of 2.0 +/- 0.0 wt %), irrespective of the employed S2O82-/Fe-0 dosages. Further analysis demonstrated that the WAS dewaterability negatively corresponded to loosely bound extracellular polymeric substances (LB-EPS) and tightly bound EPS (TB-EPS). The abundant SO4- from S2O82-/Fe2+ system could effectively disrupt the gel like EPS matrix, break apart the cells and subsequently arouse the release of the water inside EPS and cells, facilitating water-solid separation. In the case of S2O82-/Fe-0, the dissolution of Fe particles was the rate-limiting step, due to the formation of oxide iron layer near Fe metallic surface, which resulted in the slow SO4 "production and thus hardly promoted WAS dewaterability. The pH adjustment could accelerate Fe dissolution and enhance the dewatering performance of S2O82-/Fe-0 process to a certain degree, but the effect was unsatisfactory. Additionally, the observations regarding the dissolved organic matters and ammonium collectively revealed that except for enhancing WAS dewatering, S2O82-/Fe2+ oxidation could concurrently degrade COD and ammonia from WAS filtrate, lighten the burden of the subsequent sewage treatment facilities and reduce operational expense. Hence, from an environmental and economic perspective, the S2O82/Fe2+ system possesses much greater promise for WAS dewatering. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Current guidelines for testing drinking water quality recommend that the sampling rate, which is the number of samples tested for fecal indicator bacteria (FIB) per year, increases as the population served by the drinking water system increases. However, in low-resource settings, prevalence of contamination tends to be higher, potentially requiring higher sampling rates and different statistical methods not addressed by current sampling recommendations. We analyzed 27,930 tests for FIB collected from 351 piped water systems in eight countries in sub-Saharan Africa to assess current sampling rates, observed contamination prevalences, and the ability of monitoring agencies to complete two common objectives of sampling programs: determine regulatory compliance and detect a change over time. Although FIB were never detected in samples from 75% of piped water systems, only 14% were sampled often enough to conclude with 90% confidence that the true contamination prevalence met an example guideline (<= 5% chance of any sample positive for FIB). Similarly, after observing a ten percentage point increase in contaminated samples, 43% of PWS would still require more than a year before their monitoring agency could be confident that contamination had actually increased. We conclude that current sampling practices in these settings may provide insufficient information because they collect too few samples. We also conclude that current guidelines could be improved by specifying how to increase sampling after contamination has been detected. Our results suggest that future recommendations should explicitly consider the regulatory limit and desired confidence in results, and adapt when FIB is detected. (C) 2018 The Author(s).

AB High throughput sequencing-based metagenomic analysis and network analysis were applied to investigate the broad-spectrum profiles of ARGs in landfill leachate from 12 cities in China. In total, 526 ARG subtypes belonging to 21 ARG types were detected with abundances ranging from 1.1 x 10(-6) to 2.09 x 10(-1) copy of ARG/copy of 16S rRNA gene. 68 ARG subtypes that accounted for 73.4%-93.4% of the total ARG abundances were shared by all leachate samples. The four most abundant ARGs, sul1, sul2, aadA and bacA can be served as ARG indicators to quantitatively predict the total abundances by linear functions (r(2) = 0.577-0.819, P < 0.001). No distinct regional distribution pattern of the ARGs was observed among different cities in China, while the ARG compositions of the leachate were clearly distinct from those of other environmental sample types. Nearly 90% ARC subtypes in the anaerobic digestion sludge from sewage treatment plants (STPADS) were shared by the leachate and the abundances of leachate and STPADS ARGs generalists accounted for 84.5% and 87.7% of total abundances in these two types of anaerobic samples, respectively. Furthermore, Procrustes analysis suggested that microbial community composition might be the determining factor of ARG compositions in landfill leachate. ARGs within the same type or among the different types showed higher incidences of nonrandom co-occurrence and 17 genera might be potential hosts of multiple ARGs. This study highlighted that landfill leachate is an important reservoir of various ARGs and provided a useful reference for the surveillance and risk management of ARGs in landfill environments.

AB Field monitoring strategy is critical for disaster preparedness and watershed emergency environmental management. However, development of such is also highly challenging. Despite the efforts and progress thus far, no definitive guidelines or solutions are available worldwide for quantitatively designing a monitoring network in response to river chemical spill incidents, except general rules based on administrative divisions or arbitrary interpolation on routine monitoring sections. To address this gap, a novel framework for spatial-temporal network design was proposed in this study. The framework combines contaminant transport modelling with discrete entropy theory and spectral analysis. The water quality model was applied to forecast the spatio-temporal distribution of contaminant after spills and then corresponding information transfer. indexes (ITIs) and Fourier approximation periodic functions were estimated as critical measures for setting sampling locations and times. The results indicate that the framework can produce scientific preparedness plans of emergency monitoring based on scenario analysis of spill risks as well as rapid design as soon as the incident happened but not prepared. The framework was applied to a hypothetical spill case based on tracer experiment and a real nitrobenzene spill incident case to demonstrate its suitability and effectiveness. The newly-designed temporal-spatial monitoring network captured major pollution information at relatively low costs. It showed obvious benefits for follow-up early-warning and treatment as well as for aftermath recovery and assessment. The underlying drivers of ITIs as well as the limitations and uncertainty of the approach were analyzed based on the case studies. Comparison with existing monitoring network design approaches, management implications, and generalized applicability were also discussed. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Quaternary ammonium compounds (QACs) are emerging contaminants with the extensive applications in a variety of fields. However, little is known about their potential impacts on activated sludge and performance of biological wastewater treatment processes. In this work, the effects of benzalkonium chloride (BAC, a kind of QACs) on acute and chronic responses of microorganisms and on MBR performance were systematically investigated. The results showed that a low concentration (0.5-2.0 mg BAC/g SS) caused no significant effects on activated sludge property. In contrast, an elevated concentration of BAC led to severer inhibition on activated sludge and key enzyme activity (e.g., dehydrogenase activity) in both short-term and long-term exposure, thus deteriorating the pollutant removal efficiency. Compared with the control MBR (RI) and the reactor with 0.5 mg/L BAC (R2), the removal efficiency of ammonia in R3 with 5.0 mg/L BAC at identical hydraulic retention time (43 h) and sludge retention time (30d) was decreased, i.e., ammonium removal efficiency in R1 similar to R3 was 95.4 +/- 6.1, 93.4 +/- 8.1 and 89.3 +/- 17.6%, respectively. Moreover, MBR tests showed that membrane fouling was aggravated in the presence of high -concentration BAC. Long-term exposure to BAC reduced microbial community diversity and enriched the BAC-resistant microbes. For instance, the abundance of Pseudomonas genus in R3 was increased from 0.02% to 14.9% with the increase of operation time. Microbial community structure was changed to resist the'environmental stress induced by BAC during long-term exposure, thus decreasing the inhibition effects. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Ionizable antibiotics have attracted serious concerns because of their variable dissociation forms and thereby rendering unique toxicity and microorganism resistance. Developing an efficient and environmentally friendly method for removing these micropollutants from environmental media remains very challenging. Here, electro-assisted adsorption onto activated carbon fiber in continuous-flow mode was used to remove three ionizable antibiotics, sulfadimethoxine (SDM), ciprofloxacin (CIP), and cladthromycin (CIA), from water. Benefiting from strengthened electrostatic interactions, the adsorption capacities for the target antibiotics (10 mg/L) in flow mode (70.9-202.2 mg/g) increased by similar to 5 times under a potential of 1.0 V (SDM) or- 1,0 V (CIP and CLA) relative to those of open circuit (OC) adsorption. Meanwhile, effluent concentration decreased from >100 mu g/L to 9.6 mu g/L with removal efficiency increasing from 99.0% to 99.9%. Moreover, high recovery efficiency of ACF up to 96.35 +/- 0.65% was achieved by imposing a reverse potential (-1.0 V) relative to that used for SDM adsorption. In addition, trace levels of antibiotics (364-580 ng/L) in surface water could be removed effectively to achieve low effluent concentration (0.4-1.2 ng/L) and high removal efficiency (99.9%) upon treating up to similar to 1560 bed volumes (BVs), demonstrating the potential of electro-assisted adsorption for practical application in water treatment.

AB The long term behavior of total nitrogen and its components was investigated in a soil aquifer treatment system of the Dan Region Reclamation Project (Shafdan), Tel-Aviv, Israel. Use is made of the previous 40 years' secondary data for the main nitrogen components (ammonium, nitrate and organic nitrogen) in recharged effluent and observation wells located inside an infiltration basin. The wells were drilled to 106 and 67 m, both in a similar position within the basin. The transport characteristics of each nitrogen component were evaluated based on chloride travel-time, calculated by a cross-correlation between its concentration in the recharge effluent and the observation wells. Changes in the source of recharge effluent, wastewater treatment technology and recharge regime were found to be the main factors affecting turnover in total nitrogen and its components. During aerobic operation of the infiltration basins, most organic nitrogen and ammonium will be converted to nitrate. Total nitrogen removal in the upper part of the aquifer was found to be 47-63% by denitrification and absorption, and overall removal, including the lower part of the aquifer, was 49-83%. To maintain the aerobic operation of the infiltration fields, the total nitrogen load should remain below 10 mg/L Above this limit, ammonium and organic nitrogen will be displaced into the aquifer.

AB The fate of fourteen target perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) are described within a small stream affected by a sewage treatment plant (STP) effluent. Concentrations of target PFASs in samples of water, benthic macroinvertebrates and brown trout (Salmo trutta) are presented. Two hundred brown trout individuals originating from clean sites within the same stream were tagged and stocked into an experimental site affected by the STP's effluent. As a passive sampling approach, polar organic chemical integrative samplers (POCIS) were deployed in the water to reveal the water-macroinvertebrates-fish biotransformation processes of PFASs. Bioconcentration/bioaccumulation of target compounds was monitored one, three, and six months after stocking. Twelve of the fourteen target PFASs were found in concentration above the LOQ in at least one of the studied matrices. The compound pattern varied significantly between both the studied species and water samples. Concerning the accumulation of PFASs in fish, the highest concentrations were found in the liver of individuals sampled after three months of exposure. These concentrations rapidly decreased after six months although the water concentrations were slightly increasing during experiment. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Planning of water reuse systems is a complex endeavor. We have developed a software toolkit, IRIPT (Integrated Urban Reclaimed Water Infrastructure Planning Toolkit) that facilitates planning and design of reclaimed water infrastructure for both centralized and hybrid configurations that incorporate satellite treatment plants (STPs). The toolkit includes a Pipeline Designer (PRODOT) that optimizes routing and sizing of pipelines for wastewater capture and reclaimed water distribution, a Selector (SeIWTP) that assembles and optimizes wastewater treatment trains, and a Calculator (CalcBenefit) that estimates fees, revenues, and subsidies of alternative designs. For hybrid configurations, a Locator (LocSTP) optimizes siting of STPs and associated wastewater diversions by identifying manhole locations where the, flow rates are sufficient to ensure that wastewater extracted and treated at an adjacent STP can generate the revenue needed to pay for treatment and delivery to customers. Practical local constraints are also applied to screen and identify STP locations. Once suitable sites are selected, System Integrator (Tool Integrator) identifies a set of centralized and hybrid configurations that: (1) maximize reclaimed water supply, (2) maximize reclaimed water supply while also ensuring a financial benefit for the system, and (3) maximize the net financial benefit for the system. The resulting configurations are then evaluated by an Analyst (SANNA) that uses monetary and non-monetary criteria, with weights assigned to appropriate metrics by a decision-maker, to identify a preferred configuration. To illustrate the structure, assumptions, and use, of IRIPT, we apply it to a case study for the city of Golden, CO. The criteria weightings provided by a local decision-maker lead to a preference for a centralized configuration in this case. The Golden case study demonstrates that IRIPT can efficiently analyze centralized and hybrid water reuse configurations and rank them according to decision-makers' preferences. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Lately, special attention has been given to veterinary cephalosporin antibiotics due to their broad activity spectrum and significant consumption. Indeed, the determination of hydrolytic and photolytic kinetics provides a better comprehension of the undesired persistence of cephalosporins in aqueous matrices. In this work, the two widely used veterinary antibiotics ceftiofur (CEF) and cefapirin (CEPA) showed high instability under alkaline conditions, degrading in few minutes at pH > 11. In buffered solutions at neutral pH and natural temperature (T = 22 +/- 1 degrees C), both drugs presented moderate stability (t(1/2) = 3 d, CEPA and 1.4 d, CEF). Our study also demonstrated that CEPA and CEF speciation did not significantly influence the direct photolysis rates. Using a simulated water disinfection set-up (lambda = 254 nm), all ionic species of CEF and CEPA presented fast and similar pseudo-first order degradation rates, k(app) 0.0095 +/- 0.0004 and 0.0092 +/- 0.001 cm(2) mJ(-1), respectively. Furthermore, using surface water in hydrolysis experiments, CEF demonstrated significant matrix-dependent stability with a half-life (t1/2 = 14.7 d) tenfold higher than in buffered solutions. In contrast, CEPA presented a very similar hydrolysis rate in river water (t1/2 = 4.2 d). and a subtle faster photo-degradation rate in this same matrix (k(app) = 0.0128 +/- 0.001 cm(2) mJ(-1)), highlighting the importance of disinfection radiation for cephalosporin depletion in aqueous environments.

AB This study achieves a better operational simplicity for the phycoremediation of reverse osmosis (RO) concentrate using Scenedesmus quadricauda microalgae. Under continuous illumination with CO2 supplementation, algal growth in the RO concentrate resulted in a conversion of polymeric organic matter (a mixture of humic substances and polysaccharides) to biodegradable fractions and their prompt removal along with inorganic nutrients (NO3- and PO43-). The algal-induced degradation of humic-like substances which are typically refractory to microbial decomposition was demonstrated in an indirect manner. In this study, we also investigated the effects of algal treatment on the growth of Escherichia coli and removal of trace organic compounds (TOrCs) from the RO concentrate. Our results indicate that algal treatment of the RO concentrate using aeration with 10% (v/v) CO2 under continuous illumination is highly feasible as a safe and inexpensive technology to remove non- or slowly-biodegradable organic matter, reduce enteric bacteria, and attenuate TOrCs in wastewater. However, the results should not be generalized, but critically discussed, due to limitations of using the synthetic RO concentrate in evaluating the performance of wastewater remediation with microalgae.

AB The present study investigated the impact of different loading approaches and microbial activity on the Natural Organic Matter (NOM) removal efficiency and capacity of ion exchange resins. Gaining further knowledge on the impact of loading approaches is of relevance because laboratory-scale multiple loading tests (MLTs) have been introduced as a simpler and faster alternative to column tests for predicting the performance of IEX, but only anecdotal evidence exists to support their ability to forecast contaminant removal and runtime until breakthrough of IEX systems. The overall trends observed for the removal and the time to breakthrough of organic material estimated using MLTs differed from those estimated using column tests. The results nonetheless suggest that MLTs could best be used as an effective tool to screen different ion exchange resins in terms of their ability to remove various contaminants of interest from different raw waters.
   The microbial activity was also observed to impact the removal and time to breakthrough. In the absence of regeneration, a microbial community rapidly established itself in ion exchange columns and contributed to the removal of organic material. Biological ion exchange (BIEX) removed more organic material and enabled operation beyond the point when the resin capacity would have otherwise been exhausted using conventional (i.e. in the absence of a microbial community) ion exchange. Furthermore, significantly greater removal of organic matter could be achieved with BIEX than biological activated carbon (BAC) (i.e. 56 +/- 7% vs. 15 +/- 5%, respectively) when operated at similar loading rates. The results suggest that for some raw waters, BIEX could replace BAC as the technology of choice for the removal of organic material. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Microbial induced concrete corrosion (MICC) is recognized as one of the main degradation mechanisms. of subsurface infrastructure worldwide, raising the demand for sustainable construction materials in corrosive environments. This review aims to summarize the key research progress acquired during the last decade regarding the understanding of MICC reaction mechanisms and the development of durable materials from an interdisciplinary perspective. Special focus was laid on aspects governing concrete micoorganisms interaction since being the central process steering biogenic acid corrosion. The insufficient knowledge regarding the latter is proposed as a central reason for insufficient progress in tailored material development for aggressive wastewater systems. To date no cement-based material exists, suitable to withstand the aggressive conditions related to MICC over its entire service life. Research is in particular needed on the impact of physiochemical material parameters on microbial community structure, growth characteristics and limitations within individual concrete speciation. Herein an. interdisciplinary approach is presented by combining results from material sciences, microbiology, mineralogy and hydrochemistry to stimulate the development of novel and sustainable materials and mitigation strategies for MICC. For instance, the application of antibacteriostatic agents is introduced as an effective instrument to limit microbial growth on concrete surfaces in aggressive sewer environments. Additionally, geopolymer concretes are introduced as highly resistent in acid environments, thus representing a possible green alternative to conventional cement-based construction materials.

AB Sediment bacterial communities play a critical role in biogeochemical cycling in lotic ecosystems. Despite their ecological significance, the effects of urban discharge on spatiotemporal distribution of bacterial communities are understudied. In this study, we examined the effect of urban discharge on the spatiotemporal distribution of stream sediment bacteria in a northeast Ohio stream. Water and sediment samples were collected after large storm events (discharge > 100 m) from sites along a highly impacted stream (Tinkers Creek, Cuyahoga River watershed, Ohio, USA) and two reference streams. Although alpha (a) diversity was relatively constant spatially, multivariate analysis of bacterial community 16S rDNA profiles revealed significant spatial and temporal effects on beta (13) diversity and community composition and identified a number of significant correlative abiotic parameters. Clustering of upstream and referenc'e sites from downstream sites of Tinkers Creek combined with the dominant families observed in specific locales suggests that environmentally-induced species sorting had a strong impact on the composition of sediment bacterial communities. Distinct groupings of bacterial families that are often associated with nutrient pollution (i.e., Comamonadaceae, Rhodobacteraceae, and Pirellulaceae) and other contaminants (i.e., Sphingomonadaceae and Phyllobacteriaceae) were more prominent at sites experiencing higher degrees of discharge associated with urbanization. Additionally, there were marked seasonal changes in community composition, with individual taxa exhibiting different seasonal abundance patterns. However, spatiotemporal variation in stream conditions did not affect bacterial community functional profiles. Together, these results suggest that local environmental drivers and niche filtering from discharge events associated with urbanization shape the bacterial community structure. However, dispersal limitations and interactions among other species likely play a role as well. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB PURPOSE: In this study we report an uncommon endoscopic endonasal image of an atrophic optic nerve as seen after surgical removal of a suprasellar meningioma. The peculiarity of this case is the long-lasting underestimated ocular symptomatology of the patient who reported a 15-year history of impairment of vision on her left eye.
   METHODS: A 51-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital complaining of a 15-year history of impairment of vision on her left eye. After making serendipitously the diagnosis of a suprasellar mass, we performed endoscopic endonasal surgery.
   RESULTS: The tumor was reached from below and removed safely, without manipulation of the optic pathways. At the end of tumor removal, the impressive left optic nerve atrophy due to enduring local tumor compression was visualized.
   CONCLUSIONS: To the best of our knowledge, no endoscopic endonasal image with such features has been provided in the pertinent literature. Possibly, this contribution will help identify damaged optic nerves during endoscopic endonasal surgery.

AB BACKGROUND: Neurosurgical intervention for a patient with an extensive scalp burn is rare, but it may be associated with a high risk of surgical site infection.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: An 80-year-old man had a severe and extensive scalp burn. A chronic subdural hematoma (CSDH) was observed on a computed tomographic view of the head, performed for the assessment of bacteremia during treatment in the intensive care unit. To evaluate whether the CSDH might underlie the patient's prolonged fever and sepsis, we urgently evacuated the hematoma using 1 burr hole. The surgery was uneventful. We made a skin incision through the deep burn wounds covering the right temporal muscle. We removed necrotic tissue from scalp burns continuously to avoid wound complications and intracranial infection.
   CONCLUSIONS: Temporal muscle with a constant blood supply served as an effective tissue for surgical wound closure. By use of this multidisciplinary approach, the CSDH resolved completely, and surgical wound complications were avoided.

AB BACKGROUND: Chordomas are rare tumors showing locally aggressive nature and high rates of local recurrences. Distant metastases are infrequently reported and cardiac metastases are extremely rare.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 32-year-old woman had been diagnosed with a large chordoma involving the clivus. She received a total removal of the tumor and adjuvant intensity-modulated radiotherapy. Four and a half years after the surgery, she presented with multifocal lesions in the ventricles and the right atrium, although an open thoracotomy revealed chronic inflammation. Two years after finding the cardiac lesions, thoracoscopic biopsy of the chest wall lesion revealed metastatic chordoma, She received palliative imatinib for 2 weeks before she died of tumor progression.
   CONCLUSION: This case illustrates the metastatic potential of clivus chordoma, we heart can be a site of metastasis.

   ANEURYSMS; RESECTION
AB BACKGROUND: A critical step in the far lateral approach (FLA) is exposure of the V3 segment of the vertebral artery, located deep in the suboccipital triangle (SOT). Safe exposure of the SOT is achieved by means of a plane-by-plane dissection, which carries the risk of devascularization. A suitable alternative is to lift a cutaneous muscle flap including the 3 first muscle planes and leave the deepest plane (SOT) attached to the skull base. To achieve this, it is necessary to have superficial anatomic landmarks to help identify the cleavage site. We describe the use of the nuchal lines as a safe, effective, and reproducible method to dissect the muscles to expose the SOT and vertebral artery.
   METHODS: Eight adult cadaveric heads, fixed with formaldehyde and injected, were studied. On both sides, FLA was simulated by using the nuchal lines as anatomic landmarks to expose the SOT. This technique was later applied on 10 patients requiring FLA.
   RESULTS: Anatomic dissections confirmed identification by means of the nuchal lines, of a cleavage site, which made it possible to separate the deepest muscle plane from the rest of the flap. This technique was successfully applied in 10 patients undergoing FLA.
   CONCLUSIONS: The nuchal lines allow dissection of muscles in 2 groups, one superficial and the other deep (SOT), which remains attached to the skull base. The V3 segment of the vertebral artery is easily exposed.

AB OBJECTIVE: Obvious skin flap collapse is often accompanied by reduced neurologic recovery after decompressive craniectomy. This study explored the feasibility of early cranioplasty (EC) in patients with obvious bilateral frontotemporal bone window (BFBW) collapse after decompressive craniectomy.
   METHODS: Patients with obvious BFBW collapse who underwent EC or traditional cranioplasty (TC) were divided into 3 groups according to their preoperative Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) scores. The indexes, including postoperative incision healing, salivation symptoms, postoperative infection, and 6-month postoperative follow-up after EC or TC, were compared in each group.
   RESULTS: Two of 32 patients with GCS scores of 3 to 8 points experienced poor healing of the scalp incision after EC, whereas no TC patients had poor healing. Incision healing significantly differed between these 2 groups (P > 0.05), and long-term prognoses based on GOS scores were the same after a 6-month postoperative follow-up (P > 0.05). In patients with GCS scores of 9 to 12 points, salivation improved by 84.2% and 17.6% in the EC and TC groups, respectively (P < 0.05) after a mean follow-up time of 6 months. Similarly, positive neurologic recovery rates (GOS score 4-5 points) were higher in the EC group (88.9%) than in the TC group (60.0%) (P < 0.05) and did not differ between the EC (79.3%) and TC (80.6%) groups in patients with GCS scores of 13 to 15 points (P > 0.05). However, salivation improved by 86.7% in the EC group but by only 12.5% in the TC group (P < 0.05).
   CONCLUSION: We therefore recommend EC for patients with obvious BFBW collapse and GCS scores >= 9.

   TECHNICAL NOTE
AB OBJECTIVE: Duraplasty, a common neurosurgical intervention, involves synthetic or biological graft placement to ensure dural closure. The objective of this study is to advance our understanding of the use of dural substitutes in cranial surgery.
   METHODS: The PubMed database was systematically searched to identify studies published over the past decade (2007-2017) that described duraplasty procedures. Clinical data were disaggregated and analyzed for the comparisons of biological versus synthetic grafts.
   RESULTS: A total of 462 cases were included in the quantitative synthesis. Overall, the most common indication for duraplasty was tumor resection (53%). Allografts were more frequently used in decompression for Chiari malformations compared with xenografts and synthetic grafts (P < 0.001). Xenografts were more frequently used in decompressive hemicraniectomy procedures for evacuation of acute subdural hematomas over allografts and synthetics (P < 0.001). Synthetic grafts were more frequently used in tumor cases than biological grafts (P = 0.002). The cumulative complication rate for dural substitutes of all types was 11%. There were no significant differences in complication rates among the 3 types of dural substitutes.
   CONCLUSIONS: Dural substitutes are commonly used to ensure dural closure in a variety of cranial procedures. This study provides greater insight into duraplasty practices and highlights the moderate complication rate associated with the procedure. Future studies are needed to determine the safety and efficacy of such procedures in larger prospective cohorts.

TI Surgical Resection of Pineal Epidermoid Cyst Contributed to Relieving
   Schizophrenia Symptoms
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
LA English
DT Article
DE Epidermoid cyst; Pineal gland; Schizophrenia; Tumor
ID MOOD DISORDERS; REGION; MELATONIN; GLAND; TUMOR
AB BACKGROUND: The pineal gland has been demonstrated to be involved in development of mood and psychotic disorders. However, few studies have looked at the relationship between pineal region tumors and psychiatric disorders. Intracranial epidermoid cysts usually arise in the cerebellopontine angle area and are extremely rare in the pineal region. The case of pineal epidermoid cyst presenting as schizophrenia has never been reported before.
   CASE PRESENTATION: We described the case of a 23-year-old man who presented to the hospital with symptoms suggestive of schizophrenia. During work-up, he was found to have a pineal lesion on brain magnetic resonance imaging. Total resection of the tumor was subsequently performed, and pathology confirmed an epidermoid cyst. One month after surgery, the patient's psychotic symptoms significantly improved free of drug and fully returned to work 3 months postoperatively.
   CONCLUSIONS: This case highlights the importance of including mass lesions of the pineal region in the differential diagnosis of psychotic disorders. It also provides further support that the pineal region may play a role in the pathophysiology of psychiatric diseases, although more studies will be needed to elucidate this interesting connection.

TI Effect and Feasibility of Endoscopic Surgery in Spontaneous
   Intracerebral Hemorrhage: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis

   RANDOMIZED-TRIAL; CRANIOTOMY
AB BACKGROUND: Spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage remains a major cause of death and dependence. Endoscopic surgery (ES) is potential to improve outcomes, but a consensus on the superiority of ES has not been achieved. We conducted a systematic review to clarify the effect of ES in spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage and compare it with other treatment options (craniotomy, conservation, and stereotactic aspiration [SA]).
   METHODS: We performed this review based on the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic review and Meta-Analysis. The subgroup analyses were stratified by study type, location, hematoma volume, interval to treatment, follow-up time, and stereotactic frame assistance.
   RESULTS: A total of 18 studies were included containing 1213 patients, most of whom harbored a hematoma greater than 50 mL. Compared with craniotomy and conservation, ES significantly reduced the mortality (P < 0.0001), poor outcomes (P < 0.00001), rebleeding (P = 0.0009), and pneumonia (P < 0.00001). In the subgroup analyses, late surgery (< 48 hours) benefited more from ES than early surgery (< 24 hours). The study location, hematoma volume, and stereotactic frame assistance insignificantly influenced the therapeutic effect of ES. Comparing ES and SA, we found that differences in mortality, poor outcomes, and rebleeding were insignificant, but ES had a greater evacuation rate and SA had shorter operative times.
   CONCLUSIONS: ES achieves a better performance than craniotomy and conservation in terms of reducing mortality, dependence, and specific complications. Despite being similarly effective in improving functional outcomes, ES and SA have respective advantages. ES is a feasible alternation to craniotomy and conservation, and the comparison between ES and SA warrants further study.

AB BACKGROUND: The choice of appropriate antiplatelet therapy before the Pipeline Embolization Device (PED) placement is usually guided by platelet function testing such as light transmission aggregometry (LTA). In this study, we aimed to define the optimal threshold LTA value for clopidogrel responsiveness to predict the risk of post-procedural thromboembolic complications and to help guide appropriate antiplatelet regimen.
   METHODS: A prospectively maintained database at an academic neurosurgical center in the United States was retrospectively analyzed from 2014 to 2017 to identify patients with unruptured intracranial aneurysms treated with the PED. Clinical and radiographic data were analyzed to identify thromboembolic complications in the context of platelet function testing performed by LTA.
   RESULTS: A total of 95 procedures were performed for PED placement to treat 110 unruptured intracranial aneurysms. Thromboembolic complications were encountered in 4 (4.2%) of these patients. After stratifying the complication rate based on the maximal extent of platelet aggregation after administration of an exogenous platelet agonist, a marked increase in thromboembolic events was observed in patients with LTA values greater than 50%. When LTA was dichotomized based on this value, patients with an LTA value less than 50% had a thromboembolic complication rate of 1.3% (1/80), compared with 20% (3/15) for those with LTA values >= 50% (P = 0.001).
   CONCLUSIONS: We observed the greatest increase in the rate of thromboembolic complications with LTA values of >= 50%. This can serve as an appropriate cut-off value for determining the clopidogrel response in patients undergoing endovascular treatment with the PED.

AB OBJECTIVE: To retrospectively determine the safety and efficacy of combined chemotherapy with carmustine (BCNU) wafer, bevacizumab, and temozolomide plus radiotherapy in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma (GBM).
   METHODS: A total of 54 consecutive newly diagnosed GBMs were resected at our institution between 2010 and 2016. Twenty-nine patients underwent BCNU wafer implantation into the resection cavity followed by standard radio-chemotherapy with temozolomide (TMZ, Stupp regimen) plus additional bevacizumab treatment between 2013 and 2016. Twenty-five patients who underwent resection without BCNU implantation between 2010 and 2012 were enrolled as a control group; these patients were treated with the Stupp regimen and did not receive bevacizumab. This retrospective study included evaluation of progression-free survival and overall survival, plus comparisons between the combined therapy group and the control group.
   RESULTS: There were no significant differences in age, sex, Karnofsky Performance Status on admission, isocitrate dehydrogenase 1/2 mutation ratio, or resection rate between the combined and standard therapy groups. The median overall survival in the combined therapy group and control group was 24.2 months and 15.30, respectively (P = 0.027). The median progression-free survival was 16.8 months and 7.30 months, respectively (P = 0.009).
   Overall, the incidence of adverse events leading to discontinuation of the study drug was similar between the treatment groups, except for infection, which was more common in the combined treatment group and required repeat surgery.
   CONCLUSIONS: The combined therapy showed higher efficacy compared with standard therapy in patients with GBM. Therefore, combined therapy seems to be effective with an acceptable toxicity profile.

AB BACKGROUND: Awareness of the osseous anomaly of ponticulus posticus (PP) is crucial in avoiding vertebral artery (VA) injuries during C1 instrumentation. The aim of this study was to investigate PP and its relationship with the VA with three-dimensional computed tomography angiography.
   METHODS: PP and the VA were investigated as intraoperative landmarks. The intersection of the VA to the posterior arch of C1 and the medial line and the posterior arch and VA curve around lateral masses were measured as intraoperative references.
   RESULTS: PP was identified in 14.3% of samples. The anomaly was more common in women and on the right side. Of cases, 48.2% had PP bilaterally. In PP cases, the VA had variable courses through C2 before it passed under its bony bridges on the posterior arch of C1. Mean distances were found at the intersection of the VA to the posterior arch of C1 and the medial line to be larger and the posterior arch of C1 and the VA curve around lateral masses to be narrower than normal cases. Dual computed tomography scan data from C1 with PP were used to create three-dimensional patient-specific life-sized cervical spine models. Models revealed how the bone bridge affected the VA. The feasibility (>4 mm) of a safe lateral mass screw fixation was not influenced by PP anomalies.
   CONCLUSIONS: The presence of the PP loop can limit space available for placement of the screw through the bony elements of C1. Standard screw techniques are contraindicated owing to the unacceptable high risk of VA injury.

AB OBJECTIVE: To establish a workflow integrating preoperative 3-dimensional (3D) angiography data and intraoperative real-time vascular information in microscope-based navigation for aneurysm and arteriovenous malformation (AVM) surgery.
   METHODS: In 7 patients (3 with AVMs and 4 with aneurysms), preoperative 3D rotational angiography or computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance angiography data were navigated applying a 32-slice movable CT scanner for low-dose registration scanning. The 3D vasculature was segmented and visualized by microscope-based navigation along with navigated intraoperative realtime imaging data from indocyanin green angiography and duplex ultrasonography.
   RESULTS: Automatic registration applying intraoperative CT resulted in high accuracy (registration error, 0.80 +/- 0.79 mm). The effective radiation dose of the registration CT scans (0.28-0.42 mSv) was only approximately one-sixth of a standard diagnostic head CT scan. The 3D vessel architecture could be visualized accurately in the operating microscope heads-up display and on the navigation screens in the same projection as the view angle of the surgeon, both facilitating orientation in 3D space, providing a better understanding of anatomy. In addition, intraoperative real-time modalities could be coregistered with high precision, providing further information during the course of the vascular procedure.
   CONCLUSIONS: Registration CT imaging facilitates integrating preoperative and intraoperative vascular image data with a low registration error and low radiation exposure for the patient, improving the understanding of 3D vascular anatomy during surgery with easier identification of feeding vessels in AVMs, and of the projection and configuration of aneurysms.

   MANAGEMENT; COMPLICATIONS; ANESTHESIA; PRESSURE; PROTOCOL; LESIONS; PERU
AB BACKGROUND: The sitting position has lost favor among neurosurgeons partly owing to assumptions of increased complications, such as venous air embolisms and hemodynamic disturbances. Moreover, the surgeon must assume a tiring posture. We describe our protocol for the "praying position" for pineal region surgery; this variant may reduce some of the risks of the sitting position, while providing a more ergonomic surgical position.
   METHODS: A retrospective review of 56 pineal lesions operated on using the praying position between January 2008 and October 2015 was performed. The praying position is a steeper sitting position with the upper torso and the head bent forward and downward. The patient's head is tilted about 30 degrees making the tentorium almost horizontal, thus providing a good viewing angle. G-suit trousers or elastic bandages around the lower extremities are always used.
   RESULTS: Complete lesion removal was achieved in 52 cases; subtotal removal was achieved in 4. Venous air embolism associated with persistent hemodynamic changes was nonexistent in this series. When venous air embolism was suspected, an immediate reaction based on good teamwork was imperative. No cervical spine cord injury or peripheral nerve damage was reported. The microsurgical time was <45 minutes in most of the cases. Postoperative pneumocephalus was detected in all patients, but no case required surgical treatment.
   CONCLUSIONS: A protocolized praying position that includes proper teamwork management may provide a simple, fast, and safe approach for proper placement of the patient for pineal region surgery.

AB BACKGROUND: The effectiveness and safety of LVIS stent-coiling is currently not known for treating tiny intracranial aneurysms.
   OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effectiveness and safety of Low-profile visualized intraluminal support (LVIS) stent-assisted coiling and coiling alone in treating patients with mostly ruptured tiny aneurysms.
   METHODS: Seventy-five patients with tiny intracranial aneurysms, including 63 ruptured ones, were treated endovascularly and analyzed.
   RESULTS: In the coiling group, complete occlusion was achieved in 35 patients (83.6%)-nearly complete in 4 patients (9.5%) and noncomplete in 3 patients (7.1%). Intraprocedural rerupture occurred in 2 patients (4.8%), and coil protrusion occurred in 1 patient, with a complication rate of 7.1%. Clinical follow-up at 6-12 months revealed a modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score of 0-1 in 41 patients and 3 in 1 patient. In the stent-assisted group, occlusion was complete in 12 patients (36.4%), nearly complete in 15 patients (45.5%), and noncomplete in 6 patients (18.1%). Six stents (18.2%) did not have good adherence to the wall, with thrombus formation in 3 stents (9.1%). Follow-up angiography in 27 patients at 3-6 months showed no dislocation of the stents, complete occlusion in 24 patients (88.9%), and nearly complete occlusion in the other 3 patients. At 6 months, the mRS score was 0 in 30 patients and 2 in 3 patients. No significant (P > 0.05) differences existed between the 2 groups.
   CONCLUSION: Tiny cerebral aneurysms can be safely and effectively treated with appropriate endovascular approaches based on aneurysm specific morphology, especially neck size and neck-to-dome ratio.

   CLASSIFICATION; IMPACT; ANGLE
AB BACKGROUND: T1 slope minus C2-7 lordosis (TS-CL) and cervical sagittal alignment reportedly affect health-related quality of life (HRQOL) scores after multilevel posterior cervical fusion surgery. There are no reports of a relationship between cervical alignment and patient outcomes after anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF) involving 3 or more levels. This study aimed to investigate the relationship between cervical sagittal alignment and patient-reported HRQOL after ACDF involving 3 or more levels.
   METHODS: Thirty-three patients underwent ACDF involving 3 or more levels for cervical stenosis, cervical degenerative disorder, or ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament (February 2006-April 2015). Mean follow-up duration was 57.6 +/- 33.2 months. Radiographic measurements included CO-2 lordosis, C2-7 lordosis, C2-7 sagittal vertical axis (SVA), T1 slope, and T1 slope minus cervical lordosis (TS-CL). Clinical outcomes were evaluated by Neck Disability Index (NDI) and visual analog scale (VAS) scores.
   RESULTS: There were significant correlations between C2-7 lordosis and T1 slope (r = 0.581, P = 0.004), and between C2-7 lordosis and TS-CL (r = - 0.579, P = 0.004). C2-7 lordosis, C2-7 SVA, and TS-CL had no significant correlations with NDI or VAS score after surgery. C2-7 SVA was not significantly different before and after surgery. Postoperative TS-CL (P = 0.01) and changes in T1 slope (P = 0.028) and TS-CL (P = 0.01) were significantly correlated with changes in NDI.
   CONCLUSIONS: ACDF surgery involving 3 or more levels under neutral supine position did not significantly change the postoperative cervical alignment, and thus may not significantly affect cervical alignment or HRQOL.

AB OBJECTIVE: We assessed the impact of surgery on postoperative cognitive function and ability to work in adult patients with a diffuse low-grade glioma involving eloquent brain regions and having a functional-based maximal surgical resection using intraoperative cortico-subcortical mapping under awake conditions.
   METHODS: We prospectively included 39 consecutive patients with diffuse isocitrate dehydrogenase-mutant low-grade glioma without preoperative and adjuvant oncologic treatment and assessed preoperative (mean, 24.1 +/- 21.2 days before surgery) and postoperative (mean, 14.6 +/- 13.2 months after surgery) cognitive evaluations and ability to work together with clinical, imaging, therapeutic, and follow-up characteristics before tumor progression.
   RESULTS: None of the 3 patients without preoperative cognitive deficit had postoperative worsening. We observed a significant inverse interaction between worsened postoperative cognitive function and extent of resection: 80.0%, 18.8%, and 16.7% of worsening after partial, subtotal, and total resection, respectively (P = 0.020). We observed an independent interaction between improved postoperative cognitive function and extent of resection: 20.0%, 43.7%, and 44.4% of improvement after partial, subtotal, and total resection, respectively (P = 0.022). Of the employed patients, 61.8% were unable to work preoperatively and 82.4% resumed their employment postoperatively (mean, 6.9 +/- 5.5 months). We observed an independent interaction between postoperative ability to work, similar or superior to preoperative work capacity and extent of resection (P < 0.001): 20.0%, 87.5%, and 100% ability to work after partial, subtotal resection, and total resection.
   CONCLUSIONS: The extent of the functional-based surgical resection and the residual tumor for diffuse low-grade gliomas involving eloquent brain regions correlate with postoperative cognitive outcomes and return to work rates.

AB OBJECTIVE: To evaluate functional connectivity (FC) of the ventrolateral thalamus, a common target for drug-resistant essential tremor (ET), resting-state data were analyzed before and 1 year after stereotactic radiosurgical thalamotomy and compared against healthy controls (HCs).
   METHODS: In total, 17 consecutive patients with ET and 10 HCs were enrolled. Tremor network was investigated using the ventrolateral ventral (VLV) thalamic nucleus as the region of interest, extracted with automated segmentation from pretherapeutic diffusion magnetic resonance imaging. Temporal correlations of VLV at whole brain level were evaluated by comparing drug-naive patients with ET with HCs, and longitudinally, 1 year after stereotactic radiosurgical thalamotomy. 1 year thalamotomy MR signature was always located inside VLV and did not correlate with any of FC measures (P > 0.05). This suggested presence of longitudinal changes in VLV FC independently of the MR signature volume.
   RESULTS: Pretherapeutic ET displayed altered VLV FC with left primary sensory-motor cortex, pedunculopontine nucleus, dorsal anterior cingulate, left visual association, and left superior parietal areas. Pretherapeutic negative FC with primary somatosensory cortex and pedunculopontine nucleus correlated with poorer baseline tremor scores (Spearman = 0.04 and 0.01). Longitudinal study displayed changes within right dorsal attention (frontal eye-fields and posterior parietal) and salience (anterior insula) networks, as well as areas involved in hand movement planning or language production.
   CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrated that patients with ET and HCs differ in their left VLV FC to primary somatosensory and supplementary motor, visual association, or brainstem areas (pedunculopontine nucleus). Longitudinal changes display reorganization of dorsal attention and salience networks after thalamotomy. Beside attentional gateway, they are also known for their major role in facilitating a rapid access to the motor system.

AB OBJECTIVE: To compare the diagnostic performance of O-(2-F-18-fluoroethyl)-L-tyrosine (F-18-FET) positron emission tomography (PET) and perfusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (PWI) for the diagnosis of progressive or recurrent glioma.
   METHODS: Thirty-two pretreated gliomas (25 progressive or recurrent tumors, 7 treatment-related changes) were investigated with F-18-FET PET and PWI via a hybrid PET/magnetic resonance scanner. Volumes of interest with a diameter of 16 mm were centered on the maximum of abnormality in the tumor area in PET and PWI maps (relative cerebral blood volume, relative cerebral blood flow, mean transit time) and the contralateral unaffected hemisphere. Mean and maximum tumor-to-brain ratios as well as dynamic data for F-18-FET uptake were calculated. Diagnostic accuracies were evaluated by receiver operating characteristic analyses, calculating the area under the curve.
   RESULTS: F-18-FET PET showed a significant greater sensitivity to detect abnormalities in pretreated gliomas than PWI (76% vs. 52%, P = 0.03). The maximum tumorto-brain ratio of F-18-FET PET was the only parameter that discriminated treatment-related changes from progressive or recurrent gliomas (area under the curve, 0.78; P = 0.03, best cut-off 2.61; sensitivity 80%, specificity 86%, accuracy 81%). Among patients with signal abnormality in both modalities, 75% revealed spatially incongruent local hot spots.
   CONCLUSIONS: This pilot study suggests that F-18-FET PET is superior to PWI to diagnose progressive or recurrent glioma.

TI Microvascular Decompression for Classical Trigeminal Neuralgia Caused by
   Venous Compression: Novel Anatomic Classifications and Surgical Strategy

   Trigeminal neuralgia

   MANAGEMENT; VEINS; EXPERIENCE
AB BACKGROUND: Microvascular decompression of the trigeminal nerve is the most effective treatment for trigeminal neuralgia. However, when encountering classical trigeminal neuralgia caused by venous compression, the procedure becomes much more difficult, and failure or recurrence because of incomplete decompression may become frequent. This study aimed to investigate the anatomic variation of the culprit veins and discuss the surgical strategy for different types.
   METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of 64 consecutive cases in whom veins were considered as responsible vessels alone or combined with other adjacent arteries. The study classified culprit veins according to operative anatomy and designed personalized approaches and decompression management according to different forms of compressive veins. Curative effects were assessed by the Barrow Neurological Institute (BNI) pain intensity score and BNI facial numbness score.
   RESULTS: The most commonly encountered veins were the superior petrosal venous complex (SPVC), which was artificially divided into 4 types according to both venous tributary distribution and empty point site. We synthetically considered these factors and selected an approach to expose the trigeminal root entry zone, including the suprafloccular transhorizontal fissure approach and infratentorial supracerebellar approach. The methods of decompression consist of interposing and transposing by using Teflon, and sometimes with the aid of medical adhesive. Nerve combing (NC) of the trigeminal root was conducted in situations of extremely difficult neurovascular compression, instead of sacrificing veins. Pain completely disappeared in 51 patients, and the excellent outcome rate was 79.7%. There were 13 patients with pain relief treated with reoperation. Postoperative complications included 10 cases of facial numbness, 1 case of intracranial infection, and 1 case of high-frequency hearing loss.
   CONCLUSIONS: The accuracy recognition of anatomic variation of the SPVC is crucial for the management of classical trigeminal neuralgia caused by venous compression. Selecting an appropriate approach and using reasonable decompression methods can bring complete postoperative pain relief for most cases. NC can be an alternative choice for extremely difficult cases, but it could lead to facial numbness more frequently.

AB PURPOSE: To investigate characteristics of the posterior cerebral artery anterior temporal branch aneurysm and the safety and efficacy of endovascular management.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 6 patients with anterior temporal branch aneurysms were enrolled. All 6 patients had concurrent occlusion of the ipsilateral anterior circulating arteries. The aneurysms ranged from 2.5 to 5.0 mm. All patients were treated and followed up.
   RESULTS: Four unruptured aneurysms were treated with coil embolization of the aneurysm sac only, with the parent artery maintained in 2 patients, slow flow in the parent artery in one and thrombosis at the aneurysm neck leading to parent artery occlusion in the last one. One patient with subarachnoid hemorrhage was treated with coil embolization of both the aneurysm and the parent artery, and the last patient with subarachnoid hemorrhage was treated with the Glubran 2 glue to embolize both the aneurysm and the parent artery. One patient with subarachnoid hemorrhage died of lung complication after embolization. Followed up for 3 months to 1 year, the 4 patients with unruptured aneurysms had no symptoms, including 1 patient with slow flow in the anterior temporal artery and 1 patient with thrombosis and parent artery occlusion. The remaining patient with parent artery occlusion had a good recovery.
   CONCLUSIONS: The anterior temporal artery aneurysm is a special subtype of aneurysm and can be readily misdiagnosed as on the posterior cerebral artery trunk or the superior cerebellar artery. Endovascular management has a greater success rate, good effect, and fewer complications but with greater difficulties.

AB OBJECTIVE: To address the feasibility and predictive value of multimodal image-based virtual reality in detecting and assessing features of neurovascular confliction (NVC), particularly regarding the detection of offending vessels, degree of compression exerted on the nerve root, in patients who underwent microvascular decompression for nonlesional trigeminal neuralgia and hemifacial spasm (HFS).
   METHODS: This prospective study includes 42 consecutive patients who underwent microvascular decompression for classic primary trigeminal neuralgia or HFS. All patients underwent preoperative 1.5-T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with T2-weighted three-dimensional (3D) sampling perfection with application-optimized contrasts by using different flip angle evolutions, 3D time-of-flight magnetic resonance angiography, and 3D T1-weighted gadolinium-enhanced sequences in combination, whereas 2 patients underwent extra experimental preoperative 7.0-T MRI scans with the same imaging protocol. Multimodal MRIs were then coregistered with open-source software 3D Slicer, followed by 3D image reconstruction to generate virtual reality (VR) images for detection of possible NVC in the cerebellopontine angle. Evaluations were performed by 2 reviewers and compared with the intraoperative findings.
   RESULTS: For detection of NVC, multimodal image-based VR sensitivity was 97.6% (40/41) and specificity was 100% (1/1). Compared with the intraoperative findings, the kappa coefficients for predicting the offending vessel and the degree of compression were >0.75 (P < 0.001). The 7.0-T scans have a clearer view of vessels in the cerebellopontine angle, which may have significant impact on detection of small-caliber offending vessels with relatively slow flow speed in cases of HFS.
   CONCLUSIONS: Multimodal image-based VR using 3D sampling perfection with application-optimized contrasts by using different flip angle evolutions in combination with 3D time-of-flight magnetic resonance angiography sequences proved to be reliable in detecting NVC and in predicting the degree of root compression. The VR image-based simulation correlated well with the real surgical view.

AB OBJECTIVE: Initial stenotic occlusion of the internal carotid artery with intracranial artery occlusion in acute ischemic stroke is associated with high morbidity and can benefit from endovascular therapy. However, the optimal endovascular strategy is unclear. This study aimed to evaluate the feasibility of the "half" anterograde approach and clinical outcome of treated patients. Revascularization validity of the 2 "half" anterograde approach with (Protect-Expand-Aspiration-Revascularization-Stent [PEARS] technique) or without (plain technique) using an embolic prevention device and aspiration was also compared.
   METHODS: Data on initial stenotic occlusion of the internal carotid artery with intracranial artery occlusion in our prospective stroke registry database between January 2015 and February 2017 were collected. Clinical and angiographic data were retrospectively analyzed. Clinical outcome was evaluated at 3 months, defined as a modified Rankin scale <= 2 as a good clinical outcome.
   RESULTS: Overall, 26 patients with tandem occlusion were included; 96.3% of patients had successful recanalization. The rate of a good clinical outcome was 61.8%, symptomatic parenchymal hemorrhage was 7.7%, and mortality was 15.4%. The PEARS technique took less time (56 +/- 14 vs. 97 +/- 31 minutes; P = 0.002) and had less embolic events (0 vs. 30.8%; P = 0.012) compared with the plain technique. Use of the PEARS technique was an independent predictor for shortening revascularization time beta = -0.651, P = 0.001).
   CONCLUSIONS: The half anterograde approach technique is feasible and safe for treating tandem occlusion. Furthermore, the PEARS technique is associated with a shorter reperfusion time and less embolic events than the plain technique, and should be recommended in tandem occlusion.

TI Mismatches between major subhierarchies and semantic tags in SNOMED CT
SO JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL INFORMATICS
LA English
DT Article
DE SNOMED CT; Semantic tags; Quality assurance
AB The fully specified name of a concept in SNOMED CT is formed by a term to which in the typical case is added a semantic tag. The latter is meant to disambiguate homonymous terms and to indicate in which major subhierarchy of SNOMED CT that concept fits. We have developed a method to determine whether a concept's tag correctly identifies its place in the hierarchy, and applied this method to an analysis of all active concepts in every SNOMED CT release from January 2003 to January 2017. Our results show (1) that there are concepts in almost every release whose semantic tag does not match their placement in the hierarchy, (2) that it is primarily disorder concepts that are involved, and (3) that the number of such mismatches increase since the July 2012 version. Our analysis determined that it is primarily the absence of a mechanism in the SNOMED CT authoring environment to suggest stated relationships for very similar concepts that is responsible for the mismatches. We argue that the SNOMED CT authoring environment should treat the semantic tags as part of the formal structure so that methods can be implemented to keep the sub-hierarchies in sync with the semantic tags.

TI The utility of LASSO-based models for real time forecasts of endemic

AB Introduction: Accurate and timely prediction for endemic infectious diseases is vital for public health agencies to plan and carry out any control methods at an early stage of disease outbreaks. Climatic variables has been identified as important predictors in models for infectious disease forecasts. Various approaches have been proposed in the literature to produce accurate and timely predictions and potentially improve public health response.
   Methods: We assessed how the machine learning LASSO method may be useful in providing useful forecasts for different pathogens in countries with different climates. Separate LASSO models were constructed for different disease/country/forecast window with different model complexity by including different sets of predictors to assess the importance of different predictors under various conditions.
   Results: There was a more apparent cyclicity for both climatic variables and incidence in regions further away from the equator. For most diseases, predictions made beyond 4 weeks ahead were increasingly discrepant from the actual scenario. Prediction models were more accurate in capturing the outbreak but less sensitive to predict the outbreak size. In different situations, climatic variables have different levels of importance in prediction accuracy.
   Conclusions: For LASSO models used for prediction, including different sets of predictors has varying effect in different situations. Short term predictions generally perform better than longer term predictions, suggesting public health agencies may need the capacity to respond at short-notice to early warnings.

AB MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small, non-coding RNAs involved in the regulation of gene expression at a post-transcriptional level. Recent studies have shown miRNAs as key regulators of a variety of biological processes, such as proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, metabolism, etc. Aberrantly expressed miRNAs influence individual gene expression level, but rewired miRNA-mRNA connections can influence the activity of biological pathways. Here, we define rewired miRNA-mRNA connections as the differential (rewiring) effects on the activity of biological pathways between hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and normal phenotypes. Our work presented here uses a PageRank-based approach to measure the degree of miRNA-mediated dysregulation of biological pathways between HCC and normal samples based on rewired miRNA-mRNA connections. In our study, we regard the degree of miRNA-mediated dysregulation of biological pathways as disease risk of biological pathways. Therefore, we propose a new method, miR2Pathway, to measure and rank the degree of miRNA-mediated dysregulation of biological pathways by measuring the total differential influence of miRNAs on the activity of pathways between HCC and normal states. miR2Pathway proposed here systematically shows the first evidence for a mechanism of biological pathways being dysregulated by rewired miRNA-mRNA connections, and provides new insight into exploring mechanisms behind HCC. Thus, miR2Pathway is a novel method to identify and rank miRNA-dysregulated pathways in HCC.

DE Genomic data; Cloud computing; Data sharing
ID PRIVACY; GWAS
AB Human genomic information can yield more effective healthcare by guiding medical decisions. Therefore, genomics research is gaining popularity as it can identify potential correlations between a disease and a certain gene, which improves the safety and efficacy of drug treatment and can also develop more effective prevention strategies [1]. To reduce the sampling error and to increase the statistical accuracy of this type of research projects, data from different sources need to be brought together since a single organization does not necessarily possess required amount of data. In this case, data sharing among multiple organizations must satisfy strict policies (for instance, HIPAA and PIPEDA) that have been enforced to regulate privacy-sensitive data sharing. Storage and computation on the shared data can be outsourced to a third party cloud service provider, equipped with enormous storage and computation resources. However, outsourcing data to a third party is associated with a potential risk of privacy violation of the participants, whose genomic sequence or clinical profile is used in these studies. In this article, we propose a method for secure sharing and computation on genomic data in a semi-honest cloud server. In particular, there are two main contributions. Firstly, the proposed method can handle biomedical data containing both genotype and phenotype. Secondly, our proposed index tree scheme reduces the computational overhead significantly for executing secure count query operation. In our proposed method, the confidentiality of shared data is ensured through encryption, while making the entire computation process efficient and scalable for cutting-edge biomedical applications. We evaluated our proposed method in terms of efficiency on a database of Single-Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) sequences, and experimental results demonstrate that the execution time for a query of 50 SNPs in a database of 50,000 records is approximately 5 s, where each record contains 500 SNPs. And, it requires 69.7 s to execute the query on the same database that also includes phenotypes.

AB Introduction: Heart disease remains a leading cause of global mortality. While acute myocardial infarction (colloquially: heart attack), has multiple proximate causes, proximate etiology cannot be determined by a blood-based diagnostic test. We enrolled a suitable patient cohort and conducted a non-targeted quantification of plasma metabolites by mass spectrometry for developing a test that can differentiate between thrombotic MI, non-thrombotic MI, and stable disease. A significant challenge in developing such a diagnostic test is solving the NP-hard problem of feature selection for constructing an optimal statistical classifier.
   Objective: We employed a Wisdom of Artificial Crowds (WoAC) strategy for solving the feature selection problem and evaluated the accuracy and parsimony of downstream classifiers in comparison with traditional feature selection techniques including the Lasso and selection using Random Forest variable importance criteria.
   Materials and methods: Artificial Crowd Wisdom was generated via aggregation of the best solutions from independent and diverse genetic algorithm populations that were initialized with bootstrapping and a random subspaces constraint.
   Results/Conclusions: Strong evidence was observed that a statistical classifier utilizing WoAC feature selection can discriminate between human subjects presenting with thrombotic MI, non-thrombotic MI, and stable Coronary Artery Disease given abundances of selected plasma metabolites. Utilizing the abundances of twenty selected metabolites, a leave-one-out cross-validation estimated misclassification rate of 2.6% was observed. However, the WoAC feature selection strategy did not perform better than the Lasso over the current study.

AB A microarray analysis generally contains expression data of thousands of genes, but most of them are irrelevant to the disease of interest, making analyzing the genes concerning specific diseases complicated. Therefore, filtering out a few essential genes as well as their regulatory networks is critical, and a disease can be easily diagnosed just depending on the expression profiles of a few critical genes. In this study, a target gene screening (TGS) system, which is a microarray-based information system that integrates F-statistics, pattern recognition matching, a two-layer K-means classifier, a Parameter Detection Genetic Algorithm (PDGA), a genetic-based gene selector (GBG selector) and the association rule, was developed to screen out a small subset of genes that can discriminate malignant stages of cancers. During the first stage, F-statistic, pattern recognition matching, and a two-layer K-means classifier were applied in the system to filter out the 20 critical genes most relevant to ovarian cancer from 9600 genes, and the PDGA was used to decide the fittest values of the parameters for these critical genes. Among the 20 critical genes, 15 are associated with cancer progression. In the second stage, we further employed a GBG selector and the association rule to screen out seven target gene sets, each with only four to six genes, and each of which can precisely identify the malignancy stage of ovarian cancer based on their expression profiles. We further deduced the gene regulatory networks of the 20 critical genes by applying the Pearson correlation coefficient to evaluate the correlationship between the expression of each gene at the same stages and at different stages. Correlationships between gene pairs were calculated, and then, three regulatory networks were deduced. Their correlationships were further confirmed by the Ingenuity pathway analysis. The prognostic significances of the genes identified via regulatory networks were examined using online tools, and most represented biomarker candidates. In summary, our proposed system provides a new strategy to identify critical genes or biomarkers, as well as their regulatory networks, from microarray data.

AB In this paper, we develop a Naive Bayes classification model integrated with temporal association rules (TARs). A temporal pattern mining algorithm is used to detect TARs by identifying the most frequent temporal relationships among the derived basic temporal abstractions (TA). We develop and compare three classifiers that use as features the most frequent TARS as follows: (i) representing the most frequent TARs detected within the target class ('Disease = Present'), (ii) representing the most frequent TARs from both classes ('Disease = Present', 'Disease = Absent'), (iii) representing the most frequent TARS, after removing the ones that are low-risk predictors for the disease. These classifiers incorporate the horizontal support of TARs, which defines the number of times that a particular temporal pattern is found in some patient's record, as their features. All of the developed classifiers are applied for diagnosis of coronary heart disease (CHD) using a longitudinal dataset. We compare two ways of feature representation, using horizontal support or the mean duration of each TAR, on a single patient. The results obtained from this comparison show that the horizontal support representation outperforms the mean duration. The main effort of our research is to demonstrate that where long time periods are of significance in some medical domain, such as the CHD domain, the detection of the repeated occurrences of the most frequent TARS can yield better performances. We compared the classifier that uses the horizontal support representation and has the best performance with a Baseline Classifier which uses the binary representation of the most frequent TARs. The results obtained illustrate the comparatively high performance of the classifier representing the horizontal support, over the Baseline Classifier.

AB Biomedical relation extraction can automatically extract high-quality biomedical relations from biomedical texts, which is a vital step for the mining of biomedical knowledge hidden in the literature. Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are two major neural network models for biomedical relation extraction. Neural network-based methods for biomedical relation extraction typically focus on the sentence sequence and employ RNNs or CNNs to learn the latent features from sentence sequences separately. However, RNNs and CNNs have their own advantages for biomedical relation extraction. Combining RNNs and CNNs may improve biomedical relation extraction. In this paper, we present a hybrid model for the extraction of biomedical relations that combines RNNs and CNNs. First, the shortest dependency path (SDP) is generated based on the dependency graph of the candidate sentence. To make full use of the SDP, we divide the SDP into a dependency word sequence and a relation sequence. Then, RNNs and CNNs are employed to automatically learn the features from the sentence sequence and the dependency sequences, respectively. Finally, the output features of the RNNs and CNNs are combined to detect and extract biomedical relations. We evaluate our hybrid model using five public (protein-protein interaction) PPI corpora and a (drug-drug interaction) DDI corpus. The experimental results suggest that the advantages of RNNs and CNNs in biomedical relation extraction are complementary. Combining RNNs and CNNs can effectively boost biomedical relation extraction performance.

AB Objective: Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) is an inflammatory disorder of the gastrointestinal tract that can necessitate hospitalization and the use of expensive biologics. Models predicting these interventions may improve patient quality of life and reduce expenditures.
   Materials and methods: We used insurance claims from 2011 to 2013 to predict IBD-related hospitalizations and the initiation of biologics. We derived and optimized our model from a 2011 training set of 7771 members, predicting their outcomes the following year. The best-performing model was then applied to a 2012 validation set of 7450 members to predict their outcomes in 2013.
   Results: Our models predicted both IBD-related hospitalizations and the initiation of biologics, with average positive predictive values of 17% and 11%, respectively - each a 200% improvement over chance. Further, when we used topic modeling to identify four member subpopulations, the positive predictive value of predicting hospitalization increased to 20%.
   Discussion: We show that our hospitalization model, in concert with a mildly-effective interventional treatment plan for members identified as high-risk, may both improve patient outcomes and reduce insurance expenditures.
   Conclusion: The success of our approach provides a roadmap for how claims data can complement traditional medical decision making with personalized, data-driven predictive medicine.

AB Predicting disease candidate genes from human genome is a crucial part of nowadays biomedical research. According to observations, diseases with the same phenotype have the similar biological characteristics and genes associated with these same diseases tend to share common functional properties. Therefore, by applying machine learning methods, new disease genes are predicted based on previous ones. In recent studies, some semi-supervised learning methods, called Positive-Unlabeled Learning (PU-Learning) are used for predicting disease candidate genes. In this study, a novel method is introduced to predict disease candidate genes through gene expression profiles by learning hidden Markov models. In order to evaluate the proposed method, it is applied on a mixed part of 398 disease genes from three disease types and 12001 unlabeled genes. Compared to the other methods in literature, the experimental results indicate a significant improvement in favor of the proposed method.

AB The aim of this study was to develop an audit tool with a built-in database using Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap (R)) as part of an antimicrobial stewardship program at a regional hospital in the Central Denmark Region, and to analyse the need, if any, to involve more than one expert in the evaluation of cases of antimicrobial treatment, and the level of agreement among the experts.
   Patients treated with systemic antimicrobials in the period from 1 September 2015 to 31 August 2016 were included, in total 722 cases. Data were collected retrospectively and entered manually. The audit was based on seven flow charts regarding: (1) initiation of antimicrobial treatment (2) infection (3) prescription and administration of antimicrobials (4) discontinuation of antimicrobials (5) reassessment within 48 h after the first prescription of antimicrobials (6) microbiological sampling in the period between suspicion of infection and the first administration of antimicrobials (7) microbiological results. The audit was based on automatic calculations drawing on the entered data and on expert assessments. Initially, two experts completed the audit, and in the cases in which they disagreed, a third expert was consulted.
   In 31.9% of the cases, the two experts agreed on all elements of the audit. In 66.2%, the two experts reached agreement by discussing the cases. Finally, 1.9% of the cases were completed in cooperation with a third expert. The experts assessed 3406 flow charts of which they agreed on 75.8%.
   We succeeded in creating an audit tool with a built-in database that facilitates independent expert evaluation using REDCap. We found a large inter-observer difference that needs to be considered when constructing a project based on expert judgements. Our two experts agreed on most of the flow charts after discussion, whereas the third expert's intervention did not have any influence on the overall assessment.

AB In the context of an aging population, tools to help elderly to live independently must be developed. The goal of this paper is to evaluate the possibility of using unobtrusively collected activity-aware smart home behavioral data to automatically detect one of the most common consequences of aging: functional health decline. After gathering the longitudinal smart home data of 29 older adults for an average of >2 years, we automatically labeled the data with corresponding activity classes and extracted time-series statistics containing 10 behavioral features. Using this data, we created regression models to predict absolute and standardized functional health scores, as well as classification models to detect reliable absolute change and positive and negative fluctuations in everyday functioning. Functional health was assessed every six months by means of the Instrumental Activities of Daily Living-Compensation (IADL-C) scale. Results show that total IADL-C score and subscores can be predicted by means of activity-aware smart home data, as well as a reliable change in these scores. Positive and negative fluctuations in everyday functioning are harder to detect using in-home behavioral data, yet changes in social skills have shown to be predictable. Future work must focus on improving the sensitivity of the presented models and performing an in-depth feature selection to improve overall accuracy.

Experimental ratio of clamped and unclamped electro-optic coefficients r(11)(S)/r(11)(T), is 0.97 for LGS, 0.91 for LGT, 0.31 for CTGS, and 0.49 for quartz. Most of direct electro-optic effect in LGS and LGT is associated with lanthanum ions: clamped electro-optic coefficient in lanthanum free CTGS is 14 times less than in LGS. Low piezoelectric contribution to unclamped electro-optic coefficient ill makes LGS and LGT promising materials for electro-optic devices, whose performance can be deteriorated by piezoelectric effect, especially, for high-voltage optical voltage sensors.

AB Intensive research has been carried out on optical properties of MoS2 quantum dots for versatile applications in photo catalytic, sensing and optoelectronic devices. However, white light generation from MoS2 quantum dots particularly using doping effect is relatively unexplored. Herein we report successful synthesis of Europium (Eu)/Terbium (Tb) co-doped MoS2 quantum dots to achieve white light for potential applications in optoelectronic devices. The dopant ions are introduced into the host lattice to retain the emission colors to cover the entire range of visible light of solar spectrum. Perfect white light (CIE = 0.31, 0.33) with high intensity (quantum yield = 28.29%) is achieved in these rare earth elements co-doped quantum dot system. A new peak is observed in the NIR region which is attributed to the defects present in MoS2 quantum dots. Temperature dependent study has been carried out to understand the origin of this new peak in the NIR region. It is seen that the 'S' defects in the QDs cause the appearance of this peak which shows a blue shift at higher temperature. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Sm3+ ions doped Alkaline-Earth Boro Tellurite (AEBT) glasses were prepared by using conventional melt quenching technique and characterized using the spectroscopic techniques such as FT-IR, optical absorption, emission and decay spectral measurements to understand their utility in optoelectronic devices. From absorption spectra, the bonding parameters, nephelauxetic ratios were determined to know the nature of bonding between Sm3+ ions and its surrounding ligands. From the measured oscillator strengths, the Judd-Ofelt (J-O) intensity parameters were evaluated and in turn used to estimate various radiative parameters for the fluorescent levels of Sm3+ ions in AEBT glasses. The PL spectra of Sm3+ ions exhibit three emission bands corresponding to the transitions (4)G(5/2) -> H-6(5/2), H-6(7/2) and H-6(9/2) in the visible region for which the emission cross-sections and branching ratios were evaluated. The decay spectral profiles measured for (4)G(5/2) -> H-6(7/2) transition showed single exponential for lower concentration and non-exponential for higher concentration of doped rare earth ion in the as prepared glasses. Conversion of decay spectral profiles from single to non-exponential have been analyzed using Inokuti-Hirayama (I-H) model to understand the energy transfer mechanism involved in the decay process. CIE Chromaticity coordinates were measured using emission spectral data to identify the exact region of emission from the as-prepared glasses. From the evaluated radiative parameters, emission cross-sections and quantum efficiencies, it was observed that AEBT glass with 1 mol% of Sm3+ ions is more suitable for designing optoelectronic devices.

AB A new rhodamine-based colorimetric and fluorescent turn-on chemosensor (L) has been designed and synthesized for selective and sensitive detection of Al3+ ion. The sensing behavior toward metal ion was investigated by UV/Vis and fluorescence spectroscopy. Upon addition of Al3+ ion to solution of L provided a visual color change as well as significantly fluorescent enhancement, while other metal ions including Na+, Mg2+, K+, Mn2+, Fe3+, Ni2+, Cu2+, Zn2+, Pb2+, Cd2+ and Hg2+ ions fails to generate a distinct color and spectral changes, the distinct color change and rapid switch-on fluorescence also provide naked eye detection for Al2+ ion. The mechanism involved equilibrium between non-fluorescent spirocyclic form and highly fluorescent ring open form process was utilized and 1:2 stoichiometry for L-Al3+ complex formed with an association constant of 1.42 x 10(3) M-1. Moreover, chemosensor L was applied for living cell imaging and confirmed that can be used as a fluorescent probe for monitoring Al3+ ion in living cells. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A kind of novel compound Ba1-x(Zr,Ti)Si3O9:xEu simultaneously activated by different-valence Eu2+ and Eu3+ ions has been successfully synthesized. The existence of Ti4+-O2- charge transfer (CT) transitions in Ba1-x(Zr,Ti)Si3O9:xEu is proved by the photoluminescence spectra and first principle calculations, and the Ti4+ ions come from the impurities in commercial ZrO2 raw materials. Under the excitation of multi wavelength ultraviolet radiation (lambda(Ex) = 392, 260, 180 nm), Ba1-x(Zr,Ti)Si3O9:xEu (x = 0.15) can directly emit nearly white light. The coexistence of multiple luminescent centers and the energy transfer among Zr4+-O2- Cr state, Ti4+-O2- CT state, Eu2+ and Eu3+ ions play important roles in the white light emission. Ba1-x(Zr,Ti)Si3O9:xEu (x = 0.15) has good thermal stability, in particular, the intensity of emission spectrum (lambda(Ex) = 392 nm) at 150 degrees C is similar to 96% of that at room temperature. In general, the multi-wavelength ultraviolet-excited single-phase white light emitting phosphor Ba1-x(Zr,Ti)Si3O9:xEu possesses a promise for applications in white light emitting diodes (WLEDs), agriculture, medicine and other photonic fields.

AB Four new coumarin hybrid styryl dyes are synthesized by condensing 4-(7-(diethylamino)-2-oxo-2H-chromen-3-yl)-2-morpholinothiazole-5-carbaldehyde with dicyanovinylene containing active methylene intermediates and their linear and non-linear optical properties are studied. The dye having dicyanovinylene-isophorone acceptor displayed a large Stokes shift of 3702-4795 cm(-1) in non-polar to polar solvent respectively. The dyes exhibit a good charge transfer characteristics and positive emission solvatochromism (similar to 50 nm-72 nm) in non -polar to a polar solvent which is well supported by multi linear regression analysis. Viscosity induced enhancement study in ethanol/polyethylene glycol-400 system shows 2.71-6.78 fold increase in emission intensity. The intra and twisted-intramolecular charge transfer (ICT-TICT) characteristics were established using emission solvatochromism, polarity plots, generalised Mullikan-Hush (GMH) analysis and optimized geometry. A dye having the highest charge transfer dipole moment relatively possess the maximum two-photon absorption cross-section area (KK-1 =165-207 GM) which was established using theoretical two-level model. The NLO properties have been investigated employing solvatochromic and computational methods and were found to be directly proportional to the polarity of the solvent. Z-scan results reveal that the dyes KK-1 and KK-2 possesses reverse saturable kind of behaviour whereas KK-3 and KK-4 show saturable kind of behaviour. From the experimental and theoretical data, these coumarin thiazole hybrid dyes can be considered as promising candidates for FMR and NLOphores. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The optically good quality single crystals of triphenylphosphine oxide 4-nitrophenol (TP4N) with maximum dimension of 15x10x5 mm(3) were grown by slow evaporation solution technique (SEST) at room temperature. The cell dimensions of the grown TP4N crystal were confirmed by single crystal X-ray diffraction (SXRD) and the crystalline purity was confirmed and planes were indexed by powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) analysis. Functional groups of TP4N crystal were confirmed by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectral analysis. The optical transmittance of the grown crystal was determined by the UVVis NIR spectral analysis and it has good optical transparency in the entire visible region. The band tail (Urbach) energy of the grown crystal was analyzed and it appears to be minimum, which indicates that the TP4N has good crystallinity. The position of valence band (E-v) and conduction band (E-c) of the TP4N have been determined from the electron affinity energy (E-A) and the ionization energy (E-I) of its elements and using the optical band gap. The thermal behaviour of the grown crystal was investigated by thermogravimetric and differential thermal analysis (TG-DTA). Vickers microhardness analysis was carried out to identify the mechanical stability of the grown crystal and their indentation size effect (ISE) was explained by the Meyers law (ML), Hays-Kendalls (HK) approach, proportional specimen resistance (PSR) model, modified PSR model (MPSR), elastic/plastic deformation (EPD) model and indentation induced cracking (IIC) model. Chemical etching study was carried out to find the etch pit density (EPD) of the grown crystal. Laser damage threshold (LDT) value was measured by using Nd:YAG laser (1064 nm). The dielectric permittivity (epsilon') and dielectric loss (tan delta) as a function of frequency was measured. The electronic polarizability (alpha) of the TP4N crystal was calculated. It is well matched to the value which was calculated from Clausius-Mossotti relation, Lorentz-Lorentz equation, optical band gap and coupled dipole method (CDM). The Z-scan technique was carried out using solid state laser (640 nm) to analyze the nonlinear optical properties of the TP4N crystal. It exhibits the self-defocusing and saturable absorbance effect during analysis of closed and open aperture respectively. The nonlinear optical parameters such as refractive index (n(2)), absorption coefficient (beta) and the third order nonlinear optical susceptibility (chi((3))) were analyzed.

AB This paper presents a new method for computations of the optical absorption coefficient spectra from the normalized photoacoustic amplitude spectra of thin semiconductor samples deposited on the optically transparent and thermally thick substrates. This method was tested on CuIn(Te0.7Se0.3)(2) thin films. From the normalized photoacoustic amplitude spectra, the optical absorption coefficient spectra were computed with the new formula as also with the numerical iterative method. From these spectra, the value of the energy gap of the thin film material and the type of the optical transitions were determined. From the experimental optical transmission spectra, the optical absorption coefficient spectra were computed too, and compared with the optical absorption coefficient spectra obtained from photoacoustic spectra.

AB The effect of antimony incorporation in In0.11Ga0.89As overgrown layers on the optical properties of InAs/GaAs quantum dots grown by molecular beam epitaxy has been studied. The results of photoluminescence, high resolution X-ray diffraction, atomic force microscopy, power and temperature-dependent photoluminescence from 77 K to 300 K have been correlated to characterize the grown samples. The wavelength emission increases with Sb content, and it reaches similar to 1367 run and does not increase further because of Sb incorporation's saturation in the In0.11Ga0.89As layer. To redshift further the wavelength to 1432 nm, a reduction of the growth temperature of the In(0.11)Ga(0.89)Asi(1-y)Sb(y) layer from 500 degrees C to 440 degrees C was necessary. This achievement is accompanied by the transformation of the QDs distribution to 2 QDs families. The extracted activation energies suggest that the PL quenching is mainly attributed to the thermal transfer of carriers in the QDs to the higher energy levels in the defects located within the In0.11Ga0.89As1-ySby SRLs. The variation of PL FWHM with temperature was interpreted by carrier thermalization and capture among different QDs within the same QD family or between small and large QD families.

AB TiO2 nanostructures with two different dopants, sodium and yeast have been successfully synthesized by hydrothermal method. Doping sodium is found to extend the absorbance of TiO2 into the visible region as well as it acts as mordant in fixing and improving the absorption of dye. Yeast, as a dopant, can help in absorption of more anthocyanins from the natural dye extract by TiO2 and also aids in retaining the colour of the dye and increases the stability of the dye at varying pH. Anthocyanins are the major class of pigment present in the newly addressed maroon, velvety and trumpet shaped flower "Kigelia Africana". X-ray diffraction analysis revealed the formation of rutile phase for all the samples. Field Emission Scanning Electron microscopy images revealed the formation of nanorods and nanoflowers with change in dopant as well as their concentration. The photoelectric conversion efficiency of DSSC with undoped TiO2 photoelectrode is 0.87% and DSSC with 6% Na doped TiO2 photoelectrode is 1.56%. The efficiency of DSSC with 6% Na + 6% yeast doped TiO2 photoelectrode is found to increase from 2.09% (DSSC with 6% Na + 4% yeast doped TiO2 photoelectrode) to 2.31% on varying the dopant concentration. Doping is also found to increase the dye absorption and superior charge transport efficiency which in turn helps to improve the performance of DSSC.

AB Sr2Mg3P4O15:R (R = Bi3+, Mn2+, and Bi3+/Mn2+) phosphors are synthesized by a solid-state reaction method in air. Sr2Mg3P4O15:Bi3+ phosphor with excitation 380 nm shows blue light and its emission band peaking at similar to 445 nm is observed. Under excitation at 355 and 416 nm, Sr2Mg3P4O15:Mn2+ phosphor shows red emission with a single broad emission band peaking at similar to 630 rim in the range of 500-800 rim owing to the T-4(1)(G) -> (6)A(1) transition of the Mn2+ ion. The optimal Mn2+ ion content in Sr2Mg3P4O15:Mn2+ phosphor is similar to 0.05 and the lifetime of Sr2Mg3P4O15:0.05Mn(2+) phosphor is similar to 6.17 ms. After Bi3+ ion is co-doped, emission intensity of Sr2Mg3P4O15:Mn2+ phosphor can be enhanced obviously due to energy transfer (ET) from Bi3+ to Mn2+, which is confirmed by the luminescence properties and lifetimes of Sr2Mg3P4O15:Bi3+, Mn2+ phosphor. Luminous mechanism and ET process of Sr2Mg3P4O15:Bi3+, Mn2+ phosphor are explained by the simple energy level diagram of Bi3+ and Mn2+ ions.

All the Ce-doped samples exhibited PL and scintillation with an intense broad emission in 400-550 nm in which the origin was attributed to the 5d-4f transition of Ce3+, and the emission peak became broader with increasing the concentration of Ce3+. Both PL and scintillation decay time profiles were best approximated by a sum of two exponential decay functions, and the origin of slower component was attributed to the 5d-4f transition of Ce3+. In the X-ray induced afterglow measurements, the Ce-doped Sr-2(Gd1-xLux)(8)(SiO4)(6)O-2 sample exhibited the lowest afterglow level. Furthermore, the Ce-doped Sr-2(Gd1-xLux)(8)(SiO4)(6)O-2 and Sr-2(Gd1-xLux)(8)(SiO4)(6)O-2 samples showed a clear full energy deposited peak under 5.5 MeV Am-241 alpha-ray irradiation, and the estimated absolute scintillation light yields were around 290 and 1300 ph/5.5 MeV-alpha, respectively.

AB We have investigated the thermal and optical properties of neutral red dye incorporated with different weight percentage of gold nanoparticles prepared by laser ablation method. Optical absorption studies confirmed the production of spherical nanoparticles and also the interactions of the dye molecules with gold nanoparticles. The quenching of fluorescence and the reduction in the lifetime of gold incorporated samples were observed and was due to the non-radiative energy transfer between the dye molecules and gold nanoparticles. Dual beam thermal lens technique has been employed to measure the heat diffusion in neutral red with various weight percentage of gold nano sol dispersed in ethanol. The significant outcome of the experiment is that, the overall heat diffusion is slower in the presence of gold nano sol compared to that of dye alone sample. Brownian motion is suggested to be the main mechanism of heat transfer under the present conditions. The thermal diffusivity variations of samples with respect to different excitation power of laser were also studied.

AB Thin film solar cell technologies are being developed for lower cost and flexible applications. For such technologies, it is desirable to have inexpensive, flexible cover strips. In this paper, we demonstrate that transparent silicone cover glass adhesive can be doped with TiO2 nanoparticles to achieve an optimal refractive index and maximize the performance of the cell. Cells covered with the film doped with nanoparticles at the optimal concentration demonstrated a similar to 1% increase in photocurrent over the plain (undoped) film. In addition, fused silica beads can be incorporated into the flexible cover slip to realize a built-in pseudomorphic glass diffuser layer as well. This additional degree of freedom in engineering flexible solar cell covers allows maximal performance from a given cell for minimal increased cost.

AB Single-host white-light emission phosphors stand a good chance to serve in the next-generation high-power white light emitting diodes. Eu3+-doped self-activated Ca8ZrMg(PO4)(6)(SiO4) phosphor was synthesized by a high temperature solid-state reaction which can realize white light emission by tuning spectrum. The analysis of XRD, SEM, UV-vis DRS, luminescent spectra, and emission dynamic curves were applied to investigate the obtained samples. Upon 295 nm excitation, the Ca8ZrMg(PO4)(6)(SiO4): Eu3+ phosphors contain two dominating bands peaked at 470 and 615 nm, which are attributed to the charge transfer (CT) transition from Zr4+ to O2- and the characteristic transition D-5(0)-> F-7(2) of the Eu3+ ions, respectively. In view of the energy transfer between Zr-O CT and Eu3+ ions, the chromaticity coordinates of Ca8ZrMg(PO4)(6)(SiO4): Eu3+ phosphors can be tuned from (0.2186, 0.2858) to (0.5413, 0.3295). Present work indicates that the novel Ca8ZrMg(PO4)(6)(SiO4) is a promising candidate as a single-host white phosphor with an excellent thermal stability for optical display applications.

AB In this work, the fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) and rhodamine B (RhB) dyes were encapsulated in mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNp). The MSNp-FITC-RhB nanohybrids phosphor showed a dichromatic PL emission at green region and orange region when excited at 460 nm. A Forster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) was observed from FITC to RhB. The materials were further characterized by XRD, FTIR, TEM, and temperature dependent photoluminescence. The CIE coordinates were tuned from greenish yellow to the orange region and quantum yield was reached 52.04% based on FRET. So by combining the MSNp-FITC-RhB nano hybrids phosphor with the blue LED chip, the white light emission with flexible Color Correlated Temperature and improved Color Rendering Index can be obtained.

AB Electronic structure of the transition metal (TM) dopants in ZnO is calculated by first principles approach. Analysis of the results is focused on the properties determined by the intrashell Coulomb coupling. The role of both direct and exchange interaction channel is analyzed. The coupling is manifested in the strong charge state dependence of the TM gap levels, which leads to the metastability of photoexcited Mn, and determines the accessible equilibrium charge states of TM ions. The varying magnitude of the exchange coupling is reflected in the dependence of the spin splitting energy on the chemical identity across the 3d series, as well as the charge state dependence of spin-up spin-down exchange splitting.

AB Cr3+ ions were introduced to the Ba2Mg(BO3)(2) host to provide information about the site occupation, crystal field strength, and the site symmetry. The samples were synthesized by solid-state reaction. Emission observed under 440 nm excitation was characteristic for Cr3+ ions in strong octahedral ligand field with Dq/B parameter ratio 2.74 and sharp R line at 698 nm. The charge mismatch between Cr3+ dopant and Mg2+ host ion is compensated by the creation of Cr3+ pair in the vicinity of Ba or Mg vacancy. The emission decay curve is bi-exponential with decay times 1.2 and 13.3 ms. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB We report here on a complete investigation of the excited-state absorption and fluorescence dynamics of Er3+ doped KY3F10 single crystals versus dopant concentrations and optical excitation conditions. Radiative and effective (including non-radiative relaxations) emission lifetimes and branching ratios are determined from a Judd-Ofelt analysis of the absorption spectra and via specific fluorescence experiments using wavelength selective laser excitations. Excited-state absorption and emission spectra are registered within seven spectral domains, i.e. 560 mn, 650 nm, 710 nm, 810 nm, 970 run, 1550 nm and 2750 nm. A maximum gain cross-section of 0.93 x 10(-21) cm(2) is determined at the potential laser wavelength of 2.801 mu m for a population ratio of 0.48. Saturation of fluorescence intensities and variations of population ratios versus pumping rates are registered and confronted with a rate equation model to derive the rates of the most important up-conversion and cross-relaxation energy transfers occurring at high dopant concentrations.

AB Mixed dye from hibiscus sabdariffa and eosin Y was employed in the fabrication of dye sensitized solar cell (DSSC). Nanostructured mesoporous film was prepared from the titanium dioxide (TiO2). The energy conversion efficiency of hibiscus, eosin Y and mixed dye was obtained as 0.41%, 1.53% and 2.02% respectively. Mixed DSSC has shown improvement in the performance of the cell as compared to hibiscus and eosin Y dye due to addition of synthetic organic dye. This illustrates the effect of synthetic organic dyes in performance enhancement of natural dyes. It has been credited to the improved absorption of light mainly in higher energy state (lambda = 440-560 nm) when two dyes were employed simultaneously as was obvious from the absorption spectra of dyes adsorbed onto TiO2 electrode. The cell with TiO2 electrode sensitized by mixed dye gives short circuit current density (Jsc) = 4.01 mA/cm(2), open circuit voltage (Voc) = 0.67 V, fill factor (FF) = 0.60 and energy conversion efficiency (eta) of 2.02%.

AB The Li2B4O7:Gd, CaB4O7:Gd, LiCaBO3:Gd, and Li2B4O7:Gd, Ag glasses of high optical quality, obtained by standard technology, have been investigated by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and optical spectroscopy at room temperature. The Gd impurity was added in the raw materials as Gd2O3 oxide in amounts 0.5 and 1.0 mol.%. The Ag impurity was introduced into the Li2B4O7 composition as AgNO3 and as highly dispersed metallic Ag in amount 2.0 mol.%. In all Gd-doped glasses was observed typical for glasses EPR U-spectrum of the Gd3+ (S-8(7/2), 4f(7)) ions. In the Gd-doped glasses upon the 273 rim excitation was observed weak UV emission line at 311 nm that is attributed to the P-6(7/2)-> S-8(7/2) intraconfiguration 4f - 4f transition of the Gd3+ ions. In the Li2B4O7:Gd, Ag glass has been observed significant (similar to 100 times) increasing of peak intensity of the Gd3+ emission line at 311 nm in comparison with this line in CaB4O7:Gd glass. In luminescence excitation spectra of the CaB4O7:Gd and Li2B4O7:Gd, Ag glasses are observed characteristic groups of lines corresponding to the S-8(7/2) -> I-6(J), D-6(J) transitions of the Gd3+ ions. Significant increasing of the Gd3+ emission line at 311 nm in the Li2B4O7:Gd, Ag glass is explained by energy transfer from Ag+ (4d(10)) to Gd3+ (4f(7)) upon 273 rim excitation that is resonant for 4d(10)-> 4d(9) 5s(1) (S-1(0) -> D-1(2)) and S-8(7/2) -> I-6(J) transitions of the Ag+ and Gd3+ ions. Luminescence kinetics of the Gd3+ and Ag+ centres was investigated and analysed. Obtained results show that the borate glasses, co-activated by Gd3+ and Ag+, can be promising materials for effective UVB light sources for biomedical applications.

Careful analysis of experimental results revealed presence of electron transitions typical for sixfold coordinated trivalent manganese ions with d(4) electron configuration. Thus, manganese ions doping the crystal matrix of CCG incorporate into lattice in la octahedral site-positions substituting Ga3+ ions.

AB A spectroscopic analysis of Tb3+ and Tb3+/Eu3+ doped lithium-aluminum-zinc phosphate glasses is performed through their absorbance and photoluminescence spectra, and decay time profiles. Laser parameter values (stimulated emission cross section, effective bandwidth, gain bandwidth and optical gain) were obtained for the terbium D-5(4)-> F-7(5) green emission from the Tb3+ singly-doped glass (LAZT) excited at 350 nm to judge the suitability of the glass phosphor for fiber lasers. A quantum yield of (47.68 +/- 0.49)% was measured for the D-5(4) level luminescence. Upon 350 nm excitation the LAZT glass phosphor emits green light with a color purity of 65.6% and chromaticity coordinates (0.285, 0.585) very close to those (0.29, 0.60) of European Broadcasting Union illuminant green. The Tb3+/Eu3+ codoped glass emission color can be tuned from reddish-orange of 1865 K upon 318 nm excitation to warm white of 3599 K and neutral white of 4049 K upon 359 and 340 nm excitations, respectively. Upon Tb3+ excitation at 340 nm Eu3+ is sensitized by Tb3+ through a non-radiative energy transfer with an efficiency of 0.23-0.26. An electric dipole-dipole interaction might be the dominant mechanism in the Tb3+ to Eu3+ energy transfer taking place into Tb3+- Eu3+ clusters.

AB The purpose of this work is to manufacture micro and nanotextured surfaces on plastic injection moulds with the aim of replicating them and obtaining plastic parts with optical applications. Different patterns are manufactured with nanosecond and femtosecond lasers in order to obtain three different optical applications: (i) homogeneous light diffusion (ii) 1D light directionality and (iii) 2D light directionality. Induction heating is used in the injections in order to improve the textures degree of replication. The steel mould and the plastic parts are analyzed with a confocal/focus variation microscope and with a surface roughness tester. A mock-up and a luminance camera are used to evaluate the homogeneity and luminance of the homogeneous light diffusion application in comparison with the current industrial solutions.

AB Tellurite glass systems of 73TeO(2)-4BaO-3Bi(2)O(3)-1Ag:xEu(2)O(3)-(2-x)Dy2O3 (where x = 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2 in molar ratio) composition have been successfully synthesized. In order to acquire Ag nanoparticles, materials have been heat treated at 350 degrees C in the air atmosphere. Structural properties of obtained samples were evaluated with various techniques. X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) measurements indicated that obtained materials are amorphous in nature. UV vis results presented transitions characteristic to Dy3+ and Eu3+ ions. Additionally, X-Ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) analysis indicated the presence of silver in metallic form. Photoluminescence measurements shown influence of Ag nanoparticles on emission characteristics. Simultaneous emission of Dy3+ and Eu3+ has been observed when samples were excited with lambda(exc) = 390 nm. Change of the emission color induced by heat treatment has been observed and described in case of x =1 glass series. According to CIE results emission color changes as Eu/Dy ratio and heat treatment time are changed. Emission shifts from reddish-orange to yellowish white color. Obtained photoluminescence results confirm that synthesized materials are good candidates for color tunable phosphors. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Porphyrin sensitized solar cells (PSSC) has been successfully fabricated composed of graphene quantum dots (GQD) functionalized ZnO photoanodes, zinc tetrakis (4-carboxy phenyl)porphyrin (TCPPZn) as sensitizer and polypyrrole coated oxidised multiwalled carbon nanotubes (PPy/OMWCNT) as counter electrode. The effect of the concentration of GQD on the structural, morphological, photophysical and photovoltaic properties of GQD@ZnO, and GQD@ZnO/TCPPZn nanocomposites has also been investigated. Studies indicate that TCPPZn adsorbed on the surface on GQD@ZnO. Hot electron injection mechanism and multiple exciton generation from GQD to ZnO were mainly responsible for the photoexcitation response in PSSC. This study indicates that GQD can play role of sensitizer to some extent. The time decay measurements reveals the evidences of FRET mechanism, and synergistic interaction between GQD and TCPPZn. The J(sc), V-oc, PCE of the corresponding PSSC devices enhanced initially and then decreased. Among all the devices fabricated, the PSSC with a 40% amount of GQD (GQD@ZnO/TCPPZn 40%) attains the best performance with the J(sc) = 10.1 mA/cm(2), V-oc = 0.48, PCE = 2.45% FF = 0.507 higher than ZnO@TCPPZn device fabricated without GQD. Overall, this design provides a new concept for the development of photoanodes which derive better efficiency for dye sensitized solar cell (DSSC) and PSSC at economical low cost.

AB Green synthesis techniques are developing as more simplistic and eco-friendly approach for the synthesis of metal nanoparticles compared to chemical reduction methods. Herein we report Synthesis of highly stable silver nanoparticles using Mirabillis jalapa seed extract as a reducing and capping agent. The as-prepared silver nanoparticles were characterized by UV-vis spectroscopy (UV-vis) to confirm the formation of silver nanoparticles by its characteristic surface plasmon resonance peak observed at 420 nm. The Powder X-ray diffraction (P-XRD) revealed the structure and crystalline nature of synthesized silver nanoparticles, The Fourier transform infra-red spectroscopic (FT-IR) revealed the presence of the biomolecules in the extract that acted as reducing as well stabilizing agent. The high resolution transmission electron microscopic (HRTEM) images divulged that the synthesized silver nanoparticles were spherical in shape and poly dispersed. The energy dispersive X-ray diffraction (EDX) profile revealed the elements present in the as-synthesized colloidal silver nanoparticles and its percentages. The Zeta potential measured for silver nanoparticles evidenced that the prepared silver nanopartides owned high stability in room temperature itself. The as-synthesized silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) in colloidal form were showed good antimicrobial effects and it's were found to exhibit third order optical non linearity as studied by Z-scan technique using 532 nm Nd:YAG (SHG) CW laser beam (COHERENT-Compass 215 M-50 diode pumped) output as source. The negative nonlinearity observed was well utilized for the study of optical limiting behavior of the silver nanoparticles.

AB Intense near-infrared emitting phosphor K2SrCl4:Eu2+,Nd3+ with various concentrations of Nd3+ were synthesized. These are characterized with X-ray diffraction, reflectance, photoluminescence emission and photoluminescence excitation spectroscopy, PL lifetime measurements. The emission can be excited by a broad band in near ultra violet region as a consequence of Eu2+-> Nd3+ energy transfer. The efficiency of Eu2+-> Nd3+ energy transfer is as high as 95%. Fluorescence decay curves for Eu2+ doped samples are almost exponential and described by tau = 500 ns. Eu2+ lifetimes are shortened after Nd3+ doping. Near infrared Emission intensity is limited by Nd3+-> Nd3+ energy transfer and the consequent concentration quenching. Nd3+ emission matches well with the spectral response of CIGS and CIS solar cells. Absorption of near ultra violet radiations followed by conversion to near infrared indicates the potential application in solar photovoltaics.

AB We show a flux dependence changes in structural, optical and electronic properties of InxGa1-xN nanostructures (NSs) namely nanocolumns (NCs), nanoflakes (NFs) and nanowall network (NWN) grown directly on Si(111) surface. Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) images were recorded to see morphological changes from NFs to NCs and NWNc etc, while high-resolution X-ray diffraction (HRXRD) omega - 2 theta scans were used to determine In incorporation. The maximum In incorporation was observed to be 20, 33 and 38% for the sharp transition from NFs to NCs and NWNs, respectively. The charge carrier dynamics of these grown NSs were probed using Ultrafast Femtosecond Transient Absorption Spectroscopy (UFTAS) with excitation at 350 nm pump wavelength. The UFTAS studies show the comparative charge carriers dynamics of the NWS, NCs and NFs. The charge carrier studies show a higher lifetime in NWNs as compare to NCs and NFs. Further, to examine electronic structure and level of degeneracy of these NSs, core-level and valence band spectra were analyzed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), which manifest the upward band bending ranging from 0.2 eV to 0.4 eV.

AB The composition of erbium-doped yttrium aluminate ceramics was analyzed by means of confocal luminescence spectroscopy, EDX, and X-ray diffraction. A well-defined linear correlation was found between a proposed estimator computed from the luminescence spectrum and the proportion of ceramic phases coexisting in different samples. This result shows the feasibility of using erbium luminescence spectroscopy to perform a quantitative determination of different phases of yttrium aluminates within a micrometric region in nanograined ceramics.

AB LiLa9(SiO4)(6)O-2 (LLSO) crystals doped with Pr3+ ions were grown using the slow cooling flux method. The crystals were characterized by means of luminescence and optical spectroscopy and luminescence decay measurements upon excitation in UV, VUV and X-ray range including using synchrotron radiation sources. The spectroscopic data revealed the presence Pr3+ 5d <-> 4f emission and excitation bands related to Pr3+ ions replacing La3+ i n two nonequivalent positions, and features related Pr3+ 4f -> 4f emission. The photon cascade emission is not observed in LLSO:Pr3+, since Pr3+ S-1(0) state is above the bottom of 4f(n-1)5d mixed-states band. Apart from the emission features related to Pr3+, a defect-related emission was observed upon UV, VUV, and ionizing radiation excitation. Presence of the defects was shown with thermoluminescence measurements and suggested to be the main reason for suppression the 5d -> 4f emission. Peculiarities of host-to-impurity energy transfer are analyzed and discussed. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In the present work, the influence of GO ratios on the structural, linear and nonlinear optical properties of nitrogen-doped graphene oxide nanocomposites (N-GO NCs) has been studied. N-GO NCs were synthesized by hydrothermal method. The XRD, FTIR, SEM, and TEM results confirmed the reduction of GO by nitrogen doping. The energy band gaps of N-GO NCs calculated from UV Vis analyzed by using Tauc plot. To obtain further insight into potential optical changes in the N-GO NCs by increasing GO contents, Z-scan analysis was performed with nanosecond Nd-YAG laser at 532 nm. The nonlinear absorption coefficient, 13, and nonlinear refractive index, n(2), for N-GO NCs at the laser intensity of 113 MW/cm were measured and an increase was observed in both parameters after addition of nitrogen to GO. The third-order nonlinear optical susceptibilities of N-GO NCs were measured in the order of 10(-9) esu. The results showed that N-GO NCs have negative nonlinearity which can be controlled by GO contents to obtain the highest values for nonlinear optical parameters. The nonlinear optical results not only imply that N-GO NCs can serve as an important material in the advancing of optoelectronics but also open new possibilities for the design of new graphene-based materials by variation of N and GO ratios as well as manufacturing conditions.

AB A high birefringence and ultra-high nonlinearity photonic crystal fiber (PCF) is proposed, which is composed of an elliptical As2Se3-doped core and an inner cladding with hexagonal lattice. Optical properties of the PCF are simulated by the full-vector finite element method. The simulation results show that the high birefringence of similar to 0.33, ultra-high-nonlinearity coefficient of 300757 W(-1)km(-1) and the low confinement loss can be achieved in the proposed PCF simultaneously at the wavelength of 1.55 mu m. Furthermore, by comparison with the other two materials (80PbO center dot 20Ga(2)O(3), As2S3) filled in the core, the As2Se3-doped PCF is found to have the highest birefringence and nonlinearity due to its higher refractive index and nonlinear refractive index. The flattened dispersion feature, as well as the low confinement loss of the proposed PCF structure make it suitable as a wide range of applications, such as the coherent optical communications, polarization-maintaining and nonlinear optics, etc. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

We find that despite the differences in host crystal composition and crystal structures, the (4)A(2)g -> T-4(1g) and E-2(g) -> (4)A(2g) optical transitions of the Mn4+ ion occur at similar energies. We provide some insights into the nature of chemical bonding that is responsible for the observed similarity in the spectroscopic data. Additionally, discussion is given to the site preference of the Mn4+ ion in the MFG host crystal.

The dielectric constant at incident and third harmonic wavelength is calculated using "PARAV" computer program. 1064 nm wavelength of Nd: YAG laser is incident on thin film and third harmonic signal at 355 nm wavelength alongwith fundamental light is obtained in reflection that is separated from 1064 nm using suitable optical filter. Reflected third harmonic signal is measured to trace the influence of Bi and Zn on third order nonlinear susceptibility and is found to increase with increase in Bi and Zn content in (GeSe3.5)(100-x)Bi-x, and ZnxSySe100-x-y chalcogenide thin films respectively. The excellent optical nonlinear property shows the use of chalcogenide thin films in photonics for wavelength conversion and optical data processing.

AB Tellurite glass systems modified by addition of aluminum fluoride AIF(3) have been successfully synthesized as host matrices for optically active rare earth ions RE3+ (RE3+ = Eu3+, Dy3+). Samples with different Eu3+ to Dy3+ molar ratio have been studied in order to determine possibility of white light emission via UV excitation. Structural investigations confirmed amorphous character of materials whereas spectroscopic studies brought more insight into glass network's nature. FTIR results shown presence of two features related to tellurite glass matrix (in 490-935 cm(-1) spectral region) and another one (940-1250 cm(-1)) due to aluminum addition. Especially, Al-O and Te-O-Al bonds of AlO4 tetrahedrons have been found. AlO4 units are considered as glass formers that improve network's strength and thermal resistivity against devitrification. Based on XPS studies of Al3+ photoelectron band the existence of Al-O and also Al-F bonds have been examined. Moreover, signals originating from Eu3+ and Dy3+ have been found confirming their valence state. Luminescence results revealed possibility of simultaneous UV excitation of Eu3+ and Dy3+ ions. Excitation with lambda(exc) = 390 and 393 nm resulted in white light generation starting from warm white to neutral and cool white depending on Eu3+ concentration and used excitation wavelength. Additionally, increase of decay lifetime of Eu3+ induced by Al3+ presence have been revealed based on luminescence decay analysis. Thus, tellurite glass systems modified by AlE3 and doped with Eu3+/Dy3+ may be considered as promising candidates for white light emitting sources. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Composite transparent ceramic materials are promising for improving the performance of high average-power lasers. A combination of room-temperature bonding via surface treatment by a fast atom beam and diffusion bonding via heating, which effectively controls the ion diffusion distance near the interface, makes the laser materials suitable for a variety of oscillator/amplifier. During the heat treatment of yttrium aluminum garnet (YAG) ceramics, the Si ions in the solid solution of the sintering aid incorporated within the grains were seen to segregate at the grain boundary, resulting in an increase of scattering sites. The number density and size of the scattering sites strongly depended on the post-heating temperature rather than the heating time. Specifically, heating at 1300 degrees C did not affect the transmittance of the YAG ceramic, whereas both the size and number of scattering sites substantially increased with a heat treatment at 1400 degrees C. The laser oscillation experiment using cryogenically-cooled Yb:YAG ceramics exhibited heating temperature dependence of the slope efficiency owing to the increasing scattering loss.

AB Transition metal ions (e.g. Mn2+) and lanthanide co-doped upconversion (UC) materials have attracted wide attention in recent years due to their promising application in multicolor display. Here, we report the hydro thermal synthesis and characterization of Mn2+ doped monodisperse CaF2:Yb3+/Ho3+ microspheres. The results of X-ray diffraction (XRD) revealed that Mn2+ doping does not change the cubic phase of CaF2 material but will lead to diffraction peaks shifting slightly towards higher angle due to the substitution of larger Ca2+ by the relatively smaller Mn2+. Under the excitation of 980 nm continuous wave (CW) laser, these microspheres exhibit green-yellow-red tuning colors and remarkable enhancement of both red to green ratio (R/G) and red to blue ratio (R/B) when increasing Mn2+ concentration from 0 to 30 mol%. The energy migration process between Ho3+ and Mn2+ was proposed and supported by time-decay and power dependence measurements of Ho3+ UC emission. These upconversion materials may have potential applications in optical devices, color display, nanoscale lasers and biomedical imaging.

AB Organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs) often face the issue of decreasing power efficiency with increasing brightness. Loss of charge carrier balance is one of the factors contributing to the efficiency roll-off. We demonstrate that by using a combination of doped electron transport layer (ETL) and a specially chosen electron blocking layer (EBL) having high hole mobility, this efficiency roll-off can be effectively suppressed. A tris-(8-hydroxyquinoline) aluminium (Alq(3)) based OLED has been fabricated with 2,3,6,7-Tetrahydro-1,1,7,7,-tetramethyl-1H, 5H,11H-10-(2-benzothiazolyl) quinolizino-[9,9a, 1n gh]coumarin (C5451) as the emissive dopant. Bulk doping of the Ell with lithium fluoride (LiF) was optimized to increase the luminous intensity as well as the current efficiency. An EBL with high hole mobility introduced between the EML and the hole transport layer (HTL) improved the performance drastically, and the device brightness at 9 V got improved by a factor of 2.5 compared to that of the control device. While increasing the brightness from 100 cd/m(2) to 1000 cd/m(2), the power efficiency drop was 47% for the control device whereas only a drop of 15% was observed for the modified device. The possible mechanisms for the enhanced performance are discussed.

AB A series of D-N=N-A type molecular glasses where the electron acceptor part (A) contains several electron withdrawing substituents, but the electron donating part (D) of the glassy azochromophores contains amorphous phase promoting non-conjugated bulky triphenyl or hydroxyl groups have been synthesized and investigated. Results showed that the azodye physical properties depend not only on the incorporated electron withdrawing substituents but are also influenced by the bonding type of covalently attached bulky moieties. Synthesized glassy azocompounds showed glass transition temperatures up to 106 degrees C and thermal stability up to 312 degrees C.
   The ability to form holographic gratings in spin-cast thin films of the glassy azodyes was investigated using 532 nm and 633 nm lasers obtaining diffraction efficiency up to 57%, self-diffraction efficiency up to 15% and photosensitivity as high as 3.7 J/(cm(2)%). Surface relief grating (SRG) depths reached 1.1 mu m and in some cases even exceeded the thickness of the films. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The enhanced nonlinear optical properties of phenothiazine-iodine (PT-Z-I) charge transfer complex (CTC) on composite formation with ZnS/ZnSe nanostructures are reported. The interaction between the components was confirmed by the FTIR spectra. Structural and morphological changes on nano composite formation were analyzed by scanning electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction spectra. The absorption and emission features of both the nanocomposites and their constituent components were studied. Nonlinear optical properties of all the samples in nanosecond regime were investigated by the Z-scan technique using Nd: YAG laser with 532 nm wavelength and 7 ns pulse width. The optical nonlinearity of PTZ-I CTC was found to be improved considerably on composite formation and the new systems can be proposed as excellent candidates for photonic devices. Enhanced optical nonlinearity of the composites could be attributed to charge/energy transfer mechanism between PTZ-I CTC and the nanostructures. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Tin(IV) oxide nanoparticles (SnO2 NPs) doped on the surface of graphene oxide (GO) sheets for application in Dye-Sensitized Solar Cells (DSSCs). The effective incorporation of SnO2 on the surface of GO sheets were confirmed by powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD), Fourier transform infra-red spectroscopy (FT-IR), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), and Raman spectroscopy. The morphology of the GO/SnO2 hybrid nanocomposite was confirmed by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) analysis. This current study involvement with the effect of different photo-anodes such as GO, SnO2, and GO/SnO2 hybrid nanocomposite on the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the triiodide electrolyte based DSSCs. Remarkably, GO/SnO2 hybrid nanocomposite based photo-anode for DSSC observed PCE of 8.3% and it is about 12% higher than that of un-doped TiO2 photo-anode. The equivalent short-circuit photocurrent density (J(SC)) of 16.67 mA cm(-2), open circuit voltage (V-OC) of 0.77 V, and fill factor (FF) of 0.65 respectively. The achieved results propose that the hybrid nanocomposite is an appropriate photo-anodic material for DSSCs applications.

AB Dry process-able host materials are well suited to realize high performance phosphorescent organic light emitting diodes (OLED) with precise deposition of organic layers. We demonstrate in this study high efficiency green and blue phosphorescent OLED devices by employing 3-[bis(9-ethylcarbazol-3-yl)methyl]-9-hexylcarbazole based host material. By doping a typical green emitter of fac tris(2-phenylpyridine)iridium (Ir(ppy)(3)) in the compound the resultant dry-processed green device exhibited superior performance with low turn on voltage of 3.0 V and with peak efficiencies of 11.4%, 39.9 cd/A and 41.8 lm/W. When blue emitter of bis [2-(4,6-difluorophenyl)pyridinato-C2,N](picolinato)iridium (III) was used, the resultant blue device showed turn on voltage of 2.9 V and peak efficiencies of 9.4%, 21.4 cd/A and 21.7 lm/W. The high efficiencies may be attributed to the host possessing high triplet energy level, effective host-to-guest energy transfer and effective carrier injection balance.

AB The dipolar charge distribution are most common phenomenon behind the electromagnetic radiating elements and antennas. Plasmonic nanostructures are used to induce nanoscale dipolar resonances when coupled to incident light. It is interesting to investigate the effect of skewness in the conventional dipolar resonances, which is introduced through geometrical effects in nanostructures. Here, S-shaped skewed dipolar nanostructure is used to add skewness to the dipole modes and therefore induce plasmon hybridization effects between bright and dark plasmon modes, leading to multispectral broadband plasmon induced transparency (PIT) and Fano resonances. Additionally, effective group index of the skewed dipole metasurface is retrieved and is found to be very high within the PIT window suggesting its potential use in slow light applications.

AB This study aimed to assess the disturbances in intestinal genes expression and DNA fragmentation in mice treated orally with aflatoxin B-1 (AFB(1)) or aflatoxin M-1 (AFM(1)) and the protective activity of Lactobacillus plantarum (LP). Male Balb/c mice were divided into 6 groups including the control group, the group treated with 2 mg/kg b.w of LP (2 x 10(9) cfu/mL), the groups treated with AFB(1) or AFM(1) (100 mu g/ kg b.w), and the groups treated with AFB(1) or AFM(1) during, after or before LP. Small intestines were collected for the determination of DNA fragmentation, gene expression and target protein content. The results showed that AFB(1) or AFM(1) increased DNA fragmentation, down regulated the expressions of caspase-3, caspase-9, CYP3A13, Bax and p53 as well as up-regulated the expression of TNF-alpha and Bcl-2 and their target proteins. LP succeeded to alleviate the disturbances in DNA fragmentation and the expression of these genes. The improvement was more pronounced in the group co-administered with the toxins plus LP. It could be concluded that AFB(1) and AFM(1) induced disturbances in intestinal function via the disturbances in DNA fragmentation and genes expression. LP induced a potential protective effect and is considered a promising agent against the genotoxicity induced by these mycotoxins. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Snake venom metalloproteinases (SVMPs) are the key enzymes in Russell's viper (RV) venom which target all important components of haemostasis, such as clotting factors, platelets, endothelial cells and basement membrane. The structural diversity of SVMPs contributes to the broad spectrum of biological activities. The aim of the study was to investigate the SVMP transcript profile to gain better insights into the characteristic clinical manifestations of the Myanmar Russell's viper (MRV) bites that distinguish it from the RVs of other habitats. Next generation sequencing (RNA-Seq) of mRNA from MRV venom glands (2 males and 1 female) was performed on an Illumina HiSeq2000 platform and then de novo assembled using Trinity software. A total of 59 SVMP contigs were annotated through a Blastn search against the serpent nucleotide database from NCBI. Among them, disintegrins were the most abundant transcripts (75%) followed by the P-III class SVMPs (25%). The P-II SVMPs were scarce (0.002%), while no P-I SVMPs were detectable in the transcriptome. For detailed structural analysis, contigs were conceptually translated and compared with amino acid sequences from other RVs and other vipers using Clustal Omega. The RTS-disintegrin (jerdostatin homolog) was the most abundant among transcripts corresponding to 5 disintegrin isoforms. From 10 isoforms of SVMPs, RVV-X, and Vipera lebetina apoptosis-inducing protease (VLAIP) homolog, hereby termed Daboia siamensis AIP (DSAIP), were found to be highly expressed. Venom protein analysis using SDS-PAGE followed by mass spectrometry revealed that the disintegrin was scarce, while the latter two SVMPs were abundant. These two proteins can contribute to severe clinical manifestations caused by MRV envenomation. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This study was aimed to evaluate the toxins of Xenorhabdus nematophilus bacterial isolate MDUStBa15 isolated from the nematode Steinernema carpocapsae that can parasitize two tailed mealybug Ferrisia virgata which is a new pest on tuberose. Soluble protein and organic fractions were characterized from cell free extract of X. nematophilus. Using SDS PAGE, presence of low molecular weight toxic proteins (12, 42 and 60 kDa) was observed in cell free extracts of X. nematophilus. Among these three proteins, 12 kDa was newly found in this study which showed anti-feedant activity and the maximum of 87.50% and 82.50% mortality of crawlers and adults of F. virgata, respectively at 72 h after treatment. GC-MS analysis of culture filtrates revealed the presence of five major compounds, all are exhibiting insecticidal property. Among several organic fractions, 1, 4 - epoxynaphthalene - 1 (2H) - methanol, 4,5,7-tris (1,1 - dimethylethyl) - 3,4 - dihydro; Pentacosane and Hexacosane were found in this study. Pot culture study revealed that an optimum dose of 5 ml/l of crude toxin caused the maximum mortality in crawlers (100%) and in adults (96.8%) of F. virgata at 72 h after spraying. In a field study application of 5 ml/l crude toxin along with biocontrol agent (Ladybird beetle - Cryptolaemus montrouzieri) registered the 90.55% mortality in crawlers and 73.60% mortality in adults of F. virgata at 7 days after spraying. The present study provides the clear evidence for the toxicity of protein; organic fraction and crude toxin which was obtained from X. nematophilus isolate MDUStBa15 against F. virgata on tuberose both in lab and field conditions. Hence, it can be utilised to manage the F. virgata on tuberose. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

   IDENTIFICATION
AB Phospholipases A2 (PLA(2)s) comprise a superfamily of glycerophospholipids hydrolyzing enzymes present in many organisms in nature, whose catalytic activity was majorly unveiled by analysis of snake venoms. The latter have pharmaceutical and biotechnological interests and can be divided into different functional sub-classes. Our goal was to identify important residues and their relation to the functional and class-specific characteristics in the PLA(2)s family with special emphasis on snake venom PLA(2)s (svPLA(2)s). We identified such residues by conservation analysis and decomposition of residue coevolution networks (DRCN), annotated the results based on the available literature on PLA(2)s, structural analysis and molecular dynamics simulations, and related the results to the phylogenetic distribution of these proteins. A filtered alignment of PLA(2)s revealed 14 highly conserved positions and 3 sets of coevolved residues, which were annotated according to their structural or functional role. These residues are mostly involved in ligand binding and catalysis, calcium-binding, the formation of disulfide bridges and a hydrophobic cluster close to the binding site. An independent validation of the inference of structure-function relationships from our co-evolution analysis on the svPLA2s family was obtained by the analysis of the pattern of selection acting on the Viperidae and Elapidae lineages. Additionally, a molecular dynamics simulation on the Lys49 PLA(2) from Agkistrodon contortrix laticinctus was carried out to further investigate the correlation of the Lys49-Glu69 pair. Our results suggest this configuration can result in a novel conformation where the binding cavity collapses due to the approximation of two loops caused by a strong salt bridge between Glu69 and Arg34. Finally, phylogenetic analysis indicated a correlation between the presence of residues in the coevolved sets found in this analysis and the Glade localization. The results provide a guide for important positions in the family of PLA(2)s, and potential new objects of investigation. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Rayless goldenrod (RG; Isocoma pluriflora) poisons livestock in the southwestern U.S., west Texas, and northern Mexico. The putative toxin(s) have historically been thought to be benzofuran ketones. Goats have been used successfully as a model of RG poisoning. The transmammary transfer of toxicity to offspring from lactating goats has not been studied, thus the objective of this study was to determine if nursing kids would become poisoned via mother's milk when the dams were dosed with RG. Twelve lactating goats (6 controls and 6 treated; all with twin kids) were dosed via oral gavage with alfalfa or rayless goldenrod at 2% of BW per day for 14 days. Two kids showed overt clinical signs near the end of the study; however, no dams showed clinical signs, and none developed exercise intolerance or muscle weakness. After day 11 of treatment, the RG kids showed increased (P < 0.05) serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and creatinine kinase (CK) activities until exposure to the plant via mothers' milk ended. Serum CK activity of kids declined rapidly over 7 days after transmammary exposure ended. Histopathology revealed that one kid had extensive myonecrosis that involved both myocardium and skeletal muscles. The other kids from RG-treated does had minimal myocyte degeneration and necrosis characterized by individual myofiber swelling, hypereosinophilia and loss of striation. Benzofuran ketones were not detected in the milk of lactating goats; further, dosing with RG did not alter milk composition. In summary, milk ingestion from does dosed with >300 mg/kg BW of benzofuran ketones from RG over 14 days increased mean CK concentrations in treated kids compared to controls; however kids rapidly recovered when exposure ended. Additional work is needed to better define benzofuran ketone metabolism, toxicity, and animal susceptibility. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Mycotoxins are toxic secondary metabolites mainly produced by filamentous fungal species that commonly contaminate staple foods and feeds. They cause significant economic losses and greatly harm food security. Simultaneous contamination of multiple mycotoxins and the accompanying additive and synergistic effects may cause even more serious harm. To develop a microbial consortium with the ability to degrade multiple mycotoxins, a previously identified consortium with aflatoxin B-1 (AFB(1)) degradation ability, TADC7, was domesticated by co-culturing with 500 mu g l(-1) AFB(1) and 500 mu g l(-1) zearalenone (ZEA), yielding the derived microbial consortium TMDC. After 168 h of co-culture with TMDC, 2000 mu g l(-1) AFB(1) and 2000 mu g l(-1) ZEA were degraded by 98.9% and 88.5%, respectively. The proteins or enzymes in the TADC7 cell-free supernatant played a major role in mycotoxins degradation. The degradation ratios of 5000 mu g l(-1) AFB(1) and 5000 mu g l(-1) ZEA by 48 h TMDC cell-free supernatant were 93.8% and 90.3% at 72 h, respectively. Based on 16S rRNA sequencing, Geobacillus and Tepidimicrobium might play important roles in mycotoxin degradation by TMDC, and the TMDC community composition was stable, irrespective of mycotoxin. This study established the biodegradation of different categories of mycotoxins, and will facilitate the practical application of microbial consortia in mycotoxin degradation. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Human plasma-derived medicinal products and snake antivenom immunoglobulins are unique and complex therapeutic protein products. Human plasma products are obtained by fractionating large pools of plasma collected from blood plasma donors. They comprise a wide range of protein products, including polyvalent and hyperimmune immunoglobulins, coagulation factors, albumin, and various protease inhibitors that are transfused to patients affected by congenital or acquired protein deficiencies, immunological disorders, or metabolic diseases. Snake antivenoms are manufactured from pools of plasma collected from animals, typically horses, which have been immunized against snake venoms. Transfusing antivenoms is the cornerstone therapy to treat patients affected by snakebite envenoming. Over the last thirty years, much technical and regulatory evolution has been implemented to ensure that this class of biologicals meets modern quality requirements. The purpose of this review is to compare the main developments that took place in plasma production, protein fractionation, pathogen safety, quality control, preclinical and clinical studies, and regulations of these products. We also analyze whether both fields have been influencing and cross-fertilizing each other technically and in regulatory aspects to reach modern safety and efficacy standards at global levels, and how experience in the human plasma fractionation industry can further impact the manufacture of snake antivenom and that of other animal-derived antisera.

AB In French Guiana, Bothrops atrox, Bothrops brazili, Bothrops bilineatus, Lachesis muta and Micrurus sp are responsible for most cases of snakebite envenomation. The clinical features in patients suffering from envenomations by viperid snakes involve local tissue damage and systemic manifestations, such as hemorrhage, coagulopathies and hemodynamic instability. We report a severe case of envenomation in a patient bitten by a large unidentified pit viper in French Guiana. Due to lack of antivenom, the patient only received symptomatic management. Severe manifestations of local and systemic envenomation developed, and the patient needed multiple debridement procedures and ultimately required a trans-femoral amputation. In addition, Aeromonas hydrophila was cultivated from the affected tissue, suggesting that infection contributed to necrotizing fasciitis. This case highlights the clinical features of a severe viperid snakebite envenomation, and illustrates the urgent need to ensure accessibility of effective and safe polyvalent viperid antivenom in French Guiana.

AB Objective: The aim of this study is to identify the effect on spasticity and walking of US-guided botulinum toxin type A (BoNT-A) injections administered to improve equinovarus walking pattern commonly observed in patients after stroke.
   Material and method: Twenty-three patients with post-stroke spastic equinovarus deformity were recruited. The US-guided BoNT-A injections were administered into the spastic muscles (including gastrocnemius; GK, soleus; S and tibialis posterior; TP) using a specific approach, and all of the patients were enrolled in rehabilitation programmes after the injections. Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS), Brunnstrom stage of lower limb, Functional Ambulation Score (FAS), Preferred Gait Speed (PGS) and the six-minute walk test (6MWT) were assessed at the baseline, 4 and 12 weeks after the BoNT-A injection.
   Results: Significant decreases in the MAS scores of the lower limb muscle (GK, S and TP) tone were measured 4 and 12 weeks after the BoNT-A injection when compared to the baseline scores (p < 0.05). In parallel with a reduction in spasticity there was an increase in 6MWT and PGS in the 4th and 12th weeks. Increases in motor improvement and functional ambulation score were ensured in the 12th week (p <0.05).
   Conclusion: Spastic equinovarus deformity observed in patients after stroke creates significant limitations in the patient's functional walking speed and distance. As a result, when BoNT-A injections accompanied by ultrasound to improve equinovarus deformity considering the innervation zones of the muscles with a specific approach are administered directly into the muscle at the correct point, we can say it provides hopeful results from a functional point of view.

AB The present study investigated the toxic effects of B. lienhardi venom, at the histological, hematological, biochemical and motor skill levels following a subcutaneous injection of different doses of venom. The LD50 of B. lienhardi scorpion venom was found to be 0.27 mg/Kg by subcutaneous injection route. The results clearly indicate that B. lienhardi venom induces massive tissue damages in the organs, such as lungs, heart, kidneys and liver together with hematological impairments manifested by decreased levels of both red and white series. We further demonstrated that scorpion venom is able to alter motor system by inducing motor incoordination and reducing muscle strength. The overall results confirm that the venom from B. lienhardi primarily is a highly toxic agent and has cardiotoxic, nephrotoxic, hepatotoxic and pneumotoxic activity. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

DE Fumonisin B-1; Hemocytes; Autophagic cell death; Apoptosis
ID FUMONISIN B-1
AB Fumonisins are a type of mycotoxin produced by Fusarium spp., mainly F. proliferatum and F. vertieilliodes. Fumonisins represent a potential hazard to the health of animals and humans. Autophagic cell death is a method of programed cell death called type II PCD, which has complicated connections with apoptosis. Our results indicated that FB1 substantially inhibited cell viability and was cytotoxic to hemocytes of Ostrinia furnacalis in a time and concentration dependent manner. We verified the activation of FB1 induced autophagy according to MDC staining, Lyso-Tracker Red probe staining, TEM observation and atg8-PE expression levels. We discovered that FB1 induced apoptosis in only a few cells based on Annexin V-FITC and PI staining. These results suggested that FB1 induced survivin inhibition and triggered autophagic cell death in the cell line. These findings might provide a plausible explanation for the underlying mechanisms of FB1 toxicity in insect cellular immune system. In addition, we provided the atg8 gene sequence of Ostrinia furnacalis, and it would be very useful to researchers if they were to study corn borer. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The human pathogen Staphylococcus aureus encodes the ESAT6-like Secretion System (ESS). The ESS pathway secretes pathogenic substrates such as EsxA, EsxB, EsxC, EsxD and EssD that mediate staphylococcal establishment in persistent abscess lesions. The biochemical behavior of these substrates is not fully understood. EsxC is species-specific lysine-rich homodimer that lacks recognizable topogenic sequence. Studies have shown that EsxC is required for the secretion of other substrates, thereby revealing its biomedical importance. Here, EsxC self-association was investigated in the presence of several metal ion chelators. Results show that EsxC homodimerization is abolished in the presence of EDTA and EGTA, suggesting a role for calcium in mediating EsxC self-association. Complementation experiments confirm that EsxC homodimerization is calcium-dependent. N- and C-terminal truncations of EsxC were constructed, followed by bacterial two-hybrid screening. Results show that EsxC self-association is mediated by its C-terminal domain. Affinity purification of recombinant EsxC to apparent homogeneity, followed by chemical crosslinking and SDS-PAGE led to the detection of the monomeric and dimeric forms of the protein. In contrast and when a purified EsxC variant lacking the C-terminus was subjected to similar conditions, only the monomeric form was observed. These in vivo and in vitro data highlight the contribution of the C-terminus of the virulence factor EsxC to self-association, and document a previously unreported role for calcium in mediating protein-protein interactions in this pathogenic secretion system.

ID CAVERNOUS SINUS ANGIOLEIOMYOMA; INFRATENTORIAL ANGIOLEIOMYOMA; DIAGNOSIS
AB OBJECTIVE: Primary intracranial angioleiomyoma is a rare and distinct neoplasm. Only 29 cases have been reported previously, and we aimed to investigate the clinical and radiopathologic features of these lesions.
   METHODS: Medical records and radiographs of 8 patients (7 male and 1 female; mean age: 48.7 years) at our institution were reviewed retrospectively. Patient follow-up and a literature review were performed.
   RESULTS: The most common preoperative symptom was a visual defect (n = 2), followed by diplopia (n = 1) and abducens paralysis (n = 1). Three patients were asymptomatic. The parasellar area (particularly the cavernous sinus) was the predilection site (n = 4; 50.0%). Radiographically, all lesions were solid without cystic degeneration. All lesions appeared with T1 hypointensity and T2 hyperintensity, and they were gradually heterogeneously enhanced after the administration of gadolinium. Complete resection was achieved in 7 patients (87.5%) without recurrence after 26.8 months of follow-up. Mitosis was rarely observed, and the Ki-67 labeling index was less than 1%; pathologically, the cavernous type was the most common.
   CONCLUSIONS: Primary intracranial angioleiomyomas were prevalent in middle-aged men, and they usually involved the cavernous sinus and were frequently pathologically identified as the cavernous type. Preoperative symptoms varied depending on lesion location. The preoperative diagnosis of primary intracranial angioleiomyomas is difficult without pathology. Digital subtraction angiography and preoperative embolization are useful for differential diagnosis and surgery. Given the indolent biology of these tumors, a favorable outcome can be achieved using total resection without recurrence. A larger sample size with long-term follow-up is needed to verify our findings.

AB Dr. Robert J. White (1926-2010) was an eminent neurosurgeon and bioethicist, renowned for his classic work in hypothermia and pioneering mammalian head transplant experiments. He founded the Division of Neurosurgery at the Cleveland Metropolitan General Hospital (currently MetroHealth Medical Center, a level 1 trauma county hospital) and became the youngest full professor at the Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, Ohio. With over 500 research articles to his credit, he founded the Brain Research Laboratory at what was then the Cleveland Metropolitan General Hospital, which was also home to future leaders in neurosurgery, neurosciences, and allied specialties. He transferred a healthy monkey head onto a surgically beheaded monkey body under deep hypothermic conditions drawing both laurels and criticisms alike. Despite a largely controversial neurosurgical research career, his original contributions to deep hypothermia have found profound clinical applications in modern trauma and vascular neurosurgery. The new fusogens and myelorrhaphy methods being tried in Europe hold promise for a future of reanastomosing 2 homologous or heterologous tracts in the neuraxis.

AB OBJECTIVE: Blood blister-like aneurysms (BBAs) in the dorsal segment of the internal carotid artery are fragile and difficult to treat, and the optimal treatment for BBAs is still controversial. We report clinical and angiographic results with procedural details for the treatment of BBA by using the endovascular patch embolization method.
   METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed patients who presented with subarachnoid hemorrhage caused by internal carotid artery-BBAs and were treated with the endovascular patch embolization method in our center from October 2011 to March 2015. Clinical records, angiographic findings, procedural details, and follow-up results are reported in this study.
   RESULTS: Eight patients were enrolled in this study. All patients were treated with the endovascular patch embolization method. The key points of this method are step-bystep stent deployment and swaying of the microcatheter to coil the aneurysm sac and the wedge-shaped space between the stent and parent artery and, thereby, in the aneurysm sac and parent artery around the aneurysm neck When the stent is completely deployed, an endovascular patch is formed and anchored around the neck of the BBA. The procedure was successful in all cases. No acute complications developed in any case. No rerupture or recurrence of the BBA occurred during follow-up. One patient with Hunt-Hess V subarachnoid hemorrhage died of multiple organ failure 4 months post treatment. Another patient died of intracranial infection related to the ventricle-peritoneal shunt. The remaining 6 patients had good clinical outcomes (modified Rankin Scale score of zero).
   CONCLUSION: Endovascular patch embolization is an improvement on stent-assisted coil embolization, which could be successfully performed only with extensive skill and patience. Endovascular patch embolization could be an effective method in BBA treatment. However, its efficacy and safety should be verified in a larger patient cohort and long-term follow-up study.

   Decompression and Fusion for Chronic Cervical Stenosis
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
LA English
DT Article
DE Cervical decompression; Reperfusion injury; White cord syndrome
ID INJURY
AB BACKGROUND: "White cord syndrome" is a very rare condition thought to be due to acute reperfusion of chronically ischemic areas of the spinal cord. Its hallmark is the presence of intramedullary hyperintense signal on T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging sequences in a patient with unexplained neurologic deficits following spinal cord decompression surgery. The syndrome is rare and has been reported previously in 2 patients following anterior cervical decompression and fusion. We report an additional case of this complication.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 68-year-old man developed acute left-sided hemiparesis after posterior cervical decompression and fusion for cervical spondylotic myelopathy. The patient improved with high-dose steroid therapy.
   CONCLUSIONS: The rare white cord syndrome following either anterior cervical decompression and fusion or posterior cervical decompression and fusion may be due to ischemic-reperfusion injury sustained by chronically compressed parts of the spinal cord. In previous reports, patients have improved following steroid therapy and acute rehabilitation.

TI "Suspended Posterior Tubercle of Atlas" with Atlantoaxial Dislocation
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
LA English
DT Article
DE Atlantoaxial dislocation; Atlas; Congenital anomaly; Posterior tubercle
AB INTRODUCTION: Congenital anomaly of the C1 posterior arch is a well-known entity and is often associated with atlantoaxial dislocation. However, a well-formed C1 posterior tubercle with absence of the remaining posterior arch is rare. Such unusual anomalies pose a surgical challenge as trying to delineate the arch early in the course of surgery could be potentially dangerous. We discuss here a similar case of C1 posterior arch defect with atlantoaxial dislocation and its management.
   CASE REPORT: A 17-year-old female presented with progressive spastic quadriparesis and neck pain. Evaluation revealed atlantoaxial dislocation with the presence of a well-formed posterior C1 tubercle in the absence of the rest of the posterior arch. C1-C2 joints were opened, and lateral masses were fused in reduced position. Intraoperatively, a posterior C1 tubercle was found suspended from the lateral masses by fibrous bands. The surgical nuances have been discussed.
   CONCLUSION: Presence of posterior tubercle alone with aplasia of the posterior arch results from a persistent posterior ossification center with non-extension of lateral ossification centers. In the presence of the C1 posterior fibrous arch, the joint spaces must be exposed first before attempting to delineate the posterior arch. This will prevent inadvertent injury to the vertebral artery and dura.

AB BACKGROUND: Isolated sphenoid mucoceles are rare, but because of their close proximity to important vasculonervous structures, local extension may result in serious consequences.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 47-year-old patient presented with headaches, meningismus, and a left homonymous lateral hemianopia. We report the atypical evolution of a posttraumatic sphenoid mucocele invading the sellar region and extending into the subarachnoid space with compression of the right optic tract, and we describe its surgical management. Further, with the aid of cadaveric specimens, we aim to analyze the precise pathway followed by the expanding collection from an anatomic perspective.
   CONCLUSIONS: Anatomic knowledge of the sellar and parasellar regions is the key to understand the process of how sphenoid mucoceles may extend intracranially. Early endoscopic drainage with a large sphenoidotomy allows favorable outcomes and prevents serious consequences.

ID EXPANDED ENDONASAL APPROACH; RESECTION; REPAIR
AB BACKGROUND: Reconstruction of large anterior skull base (ASB) defects after an endoscopic endonasal transcribriform approach (EEA-TC) remains a challenge despite the advent of the vascularized pedicled nasoseptal flap (PNSF).
   OBJECTIVE: We describe a relaxing PNSF slit incision that extends the anterior and posterior reach of the PNSF to maximize tensionless flap coverage of transcribriform ASB defects.
   METHODS: A retrospective chart review was conducted on 20 consecutive patients who underwent endoscopic endonasal transcribriform approach and subsequent PNSF reconstruction with a relaxing slit incision. At the time of endoscopic ASB reconstruction, the PNSF is rotated into position so that the anterior margin of the flap is situated at the posterior table of the frontal sinus. A relaxing slit incision is made across the sphenoidal segment of the PNSF, which is the segment of flap that bridges across the sphenoid sinus once the flap is rotated into position. The anterior reach of the flap is increased to adequately cover the posterior table of the frontal sinus, and the redundant sphenoidal flap is rotated posteriorly to make contact to the bony planum sphenoidale.
   RESULTS: No patients developed postoperative cerebrospinal fluid leaks (0%). The ASB repair was monitored via postoperative outpatient nasal endoscopy at various time points, which demonstrated excellent mucosalization of the ASB with a mean follow-up of 19.2 months (range: 4.1-36.2 months).
   CONCLUSIONS: Our simple relaxing slit incision in the sphenoidal portion of the PNSF allows for maximal tensionless coverage of extensive transcribriform defects by increasing the anterior and posterior reach of the flap.

AB BACKGROUND: Subdural hematoma, without any radiographic evidence of subarachnoid hemorrhage, is a rare presentation of a ruptured intracranial aneurysm. Even more rare is the occurrence of a pure subdural hematoma caused by a ruptured cortical saccular aneurysm. We report the eighth case of pure subdural hematoma secondary to a ruptured nonmycotic cortical berry aneurysm.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: We report a case of pure subdural hematoma secondary to a ruptured true saccular aneurysm of a cortical artery branch. The lesion was carefully delineated with computed tomography (CT) angiography (CIA) and cerebral angiography, and successfully treated with hematoma evacuation and clip ligation. The patient demonstrates no neurologic deficits 6 months after surgery, and CTA results remain negative.
   CONCLUSIONS: In the context of a presentation of spontaneous subdural hematoma, intracerebral aneurysm rupture should be considered as a possible etiology. Prompt vascular imaging with careful evaluation of the entire cerebral vasculature, including the cortical vessels, should be considered.

ID CLINICAL-FEATURES; CHILDREN; TUMORS
AB BACKGROUND: Oligodendrogliomas constitute 5% of all primary brain tumors and are the third most common cancer among intracranial tumors. More than 90% of oligodendrogliomas have supratentorial localization. Oligodendrogliomas arising in cerebellar peduncle are substantially rare, <1%. Up to now, 6 oligodendroglioma cases with cerebellar peduncle localization have been presented. We aimed to discuss our World Health Organization grade II oligodendroglioma case, which originated from cerebellar peduncle in the light of literature.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: We report a case of 43-year-old woman. Her complaints were headache, perioral numbness and gait abnormality. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed cyst-like well-demarcated lesion localized in right cerebellar peduncle. Tumor excision was performed by turning around the tumor.
   CONCLUSION: It should be kept in mind that oligodendrogliomas may be present as cerebellar peduncle localized tumors.

   STIMULATION; EXPERIENCE; CORTEX; EXTENT; OUTCOMES; IMPACT
AB BACKGROUND: Brain tumor surgery near or within eloquent regions is increasingly common and is associated with a high risk of neurologic injury. Awake craniotomy with mapping has been shown to he a valid method to preserve neurologic function and increase the extent of resection. However, the technique used varies greatly among centers. Most count on professionals such as neuropsychologists, speech therapists, neurophysiologists, or neurologists to help in intraoperative patient evaluation. We describe our technique with the sole participation of neurosurgeons and anesthesiologists.
   METHODS: A retrospective review of 19 patients who underwent awake craniotomies for brain tumors between January 2013 and February 2017 at a tertiary university hospital was performed. We sought to identify and describe the most critical stages involved in this surgery as well as show the complications associated with our technique.
   RESULTS: Preoperative preparation, positioning, anesthesia, brain mapping, resection, and management of seizures and pain were stages deemed relevant to the accomplishment of an awake craniotomy. Sixteen percent of the patients developed new postoperative deficit. Seizures occurred in 24%. None led to awake craniotomy failure.
   CONCLUSIONS: We provide a thorough description of the technique used in awake craniotomies with mapping used in our institution, where the intraoperative patient evaluation is carried out solely by neurosurgeons and anesthesiologists. The absence of other specialized personnel and equipment does not necessarily preclude successful mapping during awake craniotomy. We hope to provide helpful information for those who wish to offer function-guided tumor resection in their own centers.

TI Treatment of Wide-Neck Bifurcation Aneurysm Using "WEB Device Waffle
   Cone Technique"
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
LA English
DT Article
DE Waffle cone technique; WEB device; Wide-neck bifurcation aneurysms
ID ENDOVASCULAR TREATMENT; STENTS
AB BACKGROUND: The endovascular treatment of wide-neck bifurcation aneurysms can be challenging and often requires the use of adjunctive techniques and devices.
   METHODS: We report our first experience of using a waffle-cone technique adapted to the Woven Endoluminal Bridge (WEB) device in a large-neck basilar tip aneurysm, suitable in cases where the use of Y stenting or other techniques is limited due to anatomic restrictions.
   RESULTS: The procedure was complete, and angiographic occlusion of the aneurysm was achieved 24 hours post treatment, as confirmed by digital subtraction angiography. No complications occurred.
   CONCLUSIONS: The case reported here was not suitable for Y stenting or deployment of the WEB device alone, due to the small caliber of both posterior cerebral arteries and their origin at the neck level. The main advantage of this technique is that both devices have a controlled detachment system and are fully independent. To our knowledge, this technique has not been reported previously and this modality of treatment has never been described in the literature.

DE Coffin birth; Head wound; Italy; Middle ages; Neurosurgery; Trepanation
ID AGE; TREPANATION; TRAUMA; POPULATION; DEATH; SKULL
AB Trepanation is one of the most ancient and applied surgical treatments; several archaeologically documented cases are known, dated back from prehistory to the Middle Ages. This case study reports the anthropologic analysis of the skeletal remains of a young medieval woman and a fetus (Imola, Italy). The fetal remains were laid between her pelvis and lower limbs. A perforating injury was observed to her frontal bone. After assessing biologic profiles, we attempted to interpret the injury and to reconstruct possible circumstances of death.
   The lesion seems commensurate with a surgical intervention; signs of an osteogenic reaction were detected at its edges. It can be hypothesized that the survival of the woman undergoing the surgery was approximately 1 week and the fetus extruded after the burial. Thus, this case represents a unicum, spreading more light on the history of neurosurgery during the Early Middle Ages in Europe.

AB Obstructive hydrocephalus secondary to posterior cranial fossa space-occupying lesions is common, and treatment includes shunting or removal of the causative lesion. The list of posterior fossa space-occupying lesions is exhaustive and includes tumors, cysts, and tumor-like conditions. In the setting of cancer, the first differential is usually a metastatic deposit. However, unrelated pathologies could coexist and may be overlooked. We hereby describe an unusual case of a posterior fossa cystic, suspected metastatic lesion presenting with moderate to severe hydrocephalus in a patient with oral cavity cancer on chemotherapy, which turned out to be cysticercosis on excision, leading to a diagnostic dilemma; hence the adage "cyst with a twist"!.

A 47-year-old woman presented with a 3-month history of intermittent headache. Physical examination revealed no neurologic abnormality. Contrasted magnetic resonance imaging showed a frontal heterogeneously enhanced lesion with adjacent nonenhanced cyst. Computed tomography showed a bone density mass, which was accompanied by local hyperostosis frontalis interna, which filled the left frontal sinus and extended intracranially. The patient underwent a left frontobasal craniotomy. Both the osseous mass and cyst capsule were removed totally via a frontal craniotomy, followed by skull base reconstruction. The postoperative course was uneventful. The final pathologic diagnosis was osteoma and mucocele.

   fractures; Traumatic compression fractures; Vertebroplasty
AB A non-osteoporotic adult presented with multilevel compression fractures at the apex of the thoracic kyphosis after strenuous rope jumping. Magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated diffuse bone marrow changes in the vertebral bodies with only a small unilateral endplate fracture. Besides highlighting the oftentimes neglected role of repetitive subpathological axial load forces in traumatic spinal injuries, the observed imaging pattern substantiates previous experimental studies which demonstrated that under cyclic axial loading the initial damage occurs in the cancellous regions of the bone (with observation of cracks with average length between 50-100 mu M), ultimately leading to a reduction in its elastic modulus. This pathophysiological mechanism, in which unmitigated propagation of trabecular microscopic cracks through the vertebral bone marrow precedes endplate fractures, may provide a rationale for recent proposals of targeted cement-augmentation in traumatic compression fractures with cement injection directed toward the regions of bone marrow changes.

AB BACKGROUND: Oncotic aneurysm is a rare condition with a high mortality rate. Because no consensus has been reached regarding therapeutic strategy for ruptured oncotic aneurysm, treatment remains challenging.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 35-year-old woman developed sudden onset of severe headache. Computed tomography showed subarachnoid hemorrhage and cerebral angiography revealed 2 fusiform aneurysms in the distal portion of the left middle cerebral artery. Aneurysmectomy with vessel reconstruction using a superficial temporal artery graft was performed to maintain blood flow to the distal middle cerebral artery. Pathologic examination of the aneurysm and wall of the resected recipient middle cerebral artery showed infiltrating trophoblasts. Immunostaining for human chorionic gonadotropin was positive in the aneurysm specimen. On the basis of an elevated concentration of serum human chorionic gonadotropin, choriocarcinoma with ruptured intracranial oncotic aneurysms was diagnosed. After further systemic examination for carcinoma, chemotherapy was initiated.
   CONCLUSIONS: Aneurysmectomy, resection of the parent artery with irregular walls and reconstruction to the distal recipient artery with normal intima should be considered to secure patency of the anastomosis and prevent the recurrence of oncotic aneurysm. Subsequent chemotherapy is essential to prevent carcinomatous meningitis and disease progression.

DT Editorial Material
DE Magnetic resonance imaging; Venous anomaly
AB Open magnetic resonance imaging of a 45-year-old man with panic disorder showed a sinus pericranii (SP). Examination of the scalp revealed a discolored scalp mass, and magnetic resonance venography displayed a hypoplastic straight sinus with persistent falcine sinus.
   SP is a venous anomaly consisting of a transosseous vascular channel connecting an intracranial sinus with subgaleal veins. High venous pressure in the late embryonic stage, as with a hypoplastic straight sinus, has been hypothesized to predispose affected individuals to develop other venous anomalies (i.e., falcine sinus).
   Because there is no major venous outflow through this accessory SP in an asymptomatic adult, no intervention was recommended for our patient.

AB OBJECTIVE: To present a systematic review and meta-analysis to establish the relation between cerebral autoregulation (CA) and intracranial hypertension.
   METHODS: An electronic search using the term "Cerebral autoregulation and intracranial hypertension" was designed to identify studies that analyzed cerebral blood flow autoregulation in patients undergoing intracranial pressure (ICP) monitoring. The data were used in meta-analyses and sensitivity analyses.
   RESULTS: A static CA technique was applied in 10 studies (26.3%), a dynamic technique was applied in 25 studies (65.8%), and both techniques were used in 3 studies (7.9%). Static CA studies using the cerebral blood flow technique revealed impaired CA in patients with an ICP >= 20 (standardized mean difference [SMD] 5.44%, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.25-10.65, P = 0.04); static CA studies with transcranial Doppler revealed a tendency toward impaired CA in patients with ICP >= 20 (SMD -7.83%, 95% CI -17.52 to 1.85, P = 0.11). Moving correlation studies reported impaired CA in patients with ICP >= 20 (SMD 0.06, 95% CI 0.07-0.14, P < 0.00001). A comparison of CA values and mean ICP revealed a correlation between greater ICP and impaired CA (SMD 5.47, 95% CI 1.39-10.1, P = 0.01). Patients with ICP >= 20 had an elevated risk of impaired CA (OR 2.27, 95% CI 1.20-4.31, P = 0.01).
   CONCLUSIONS: A clear tendency toward CA impairment was observed in patients with increased ICP.

ID LUMBAR SPINE; RETRIEVAL; FIXATION; REMOVAL
AB OBJECTIVE: Spinal transpedicular screw fixation is widely performed. Broken pedicle screw rates range from 3%-7.1%. Several techniques have been described for extraction of broken pedicle screws. However, most of these techniques require special instruments. We describe a simple, modified technique for management of broken pedicle screws without extraction. No special instruments or drilling in an adjacent pedicle are required.
   METHODS: We used a high-speed air drill with a round burr.With C-arm fluoroscopy guidance, the distal fragment of a broken pedicle screw was palpated using free-hand technique through the screw entry hole. A high-speed air drill with a round burr (not a diamond burr) was inserted through the hole. Drilling began slowly and continued until enough space was obtained for new screw insertion. Using this space, we performed new pedicle screw fixation medially alongside the distal fragment of the broken pedicle screw. We performed the insertion with a previously used entry hole and pathway in the pedicle. The same size pedicle screw was used.
   RESULTS: Three patients were treated with this modified technique. New screw insertion was successful in all cases after partial drilling of the distal broken pedicle screw fragment. There were no complications, such as screw loosening, dural tears, or root injury.
   CONCLUSION: We describe a simple, modified technique for management of broken pedicle screws without extraction. This technique is recommended in patients who require insertion of a new screw.

AB OBJECTIVE: In vitro fertilization (IVF) is increasingly used for the treatment of infertile couples worldwide. The association between IVF and cancer risk in offspring is conflicting. We present a case of atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumor (AT/RT) in a girl conceived by IVF and present results of systematic review of literature of primary intracranial neoplasms diagnosed in children conceived by IVF.
   METHODS: A systematic review of literature was conducted on April 12, 2017, to identify previously published reports of intracranial brain tumors in patients conceived after IVF.
   RESULTS: A 21-month-old girl born after IVF and uneventful pregnancy presented with progressive nausea, vomiting, irritability, and right-side weakness. Magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated large heterogeneous contrast enhancing left frontotemporoparietal tumor. The operation was aborted due to asystole after subtotal tumor removal. The patient passed away on postoperative day 3. Histologic examination demonstrated AT/RT. We identified 7 previously published case reports of intracranial neoplasms in children conceived by IVF. Patient age at brain tumor diagnosis ranged from 31st week of gestation to 3 years of age. The most common histological diagnosis was AT/RT (3 cases), followed by glioblastoma multiforme, gliosarcoma, medulloblastoma, craniopharyngioma, and choroid plexus papilloma. Three of five operated patients died during perioperative period. Outcomes were dismal in 7 patients.
   CONCLUSIONS: IVF-associated brain tumors are usually malignant and associated with high mortality. Future studies investigating possible causal relationship between IVF and brain tumor risk are encouraged.

ID SPINAL SUBDURAL-HEMATOMA
AB BACKGROUND: Traumatic spinal subarachnoid hematoma, associated or not with a concurrent subdural hematoma, has rarely been described. The evolution of such hematomas is heterogeneous. This study aims at defining the most accurate management, which is currently not standardized.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 20-year-old man, victim of a high-kinetic road accident 5 days before and with several nonneurologic nonsurgical vertebral fractures, experienced a sudden dorsolumbar pain radiating to his lower limbs. A rapidly progressive asymmetric paraparesis with loss of reflexes was noticed, associated with bilateral global hypoesthesia of the lower limbs and with acute urinary retention, whereas the anal tonicity was preserved (American Spinal Injury Association C). Magnetic resonance imaging scan revealed a conus medullaris compression at the level of the L1-L2 vertebrae by an intradural expansive mass. Immediate surgical decompression revealed a strictly subarachnoid hematoma. Venous bleeding was seen at the level of the conus medullaris and controlled. Pathologic examination of the clot excluded an underlying tumor or vascular abnormality. The complete coagulation profile was normal.
   CONCLUSION: Six weeks after surgery, the neurologic examination revealed only a slight tactile hypoesthesia of the left thigh. With only 4 reported cases, purely subarachnoid spinal hematomas remain widely rarer than epidural hematomas. The reported case possesses a certain number of peculiarities: young age, pure subarachnoid location, lumbar location, occurrence after a car accident, subacute onset, and excellent neurologic recovery. In our opinion, a symptomatic subarachnoid spinal hematoma should be surgically evacuated at the early phase so neurologic recovery can be expected.

TI Microvascular Decompression for Treatment of Trigeminal Neuralgia in
   Patient with Facial Nerve Schwannoma

   decompression; Secondary trigeminal neuralgia; Vestibular schwannoma
ID CEREBELLOPONTINE ANGLE TUMORS; SURGERY
AB BACKGROUND: Secondary trigeminal neuralgia (TN) is uncommon. When a space-occupying lesion with mass effect is identified, the associated TN is often exclusively attributed to the tumor. This report illustrates the importance of considering coexistent actionable pathology when surgically treating secondary TN.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 51-year-old woman presented with abrupt-onset TN of the V2 and V3 nerve divisions with hypesthesia. She denied changes in hearing, balance, or facial nerve dysfunction. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed a 1.6-cm contrast-enhancing cerebellopontine angle tumor that effaced the trigeminal nerve, consistent with a vestibular schwannoma. In addition, a branch of the superior cerebellar artery abutted the cisternal segment of the trigeminal nerve on T2-weighted thin-slice magnetic resonance imaging. Intraoperative electrical stimulation of the tumor elicited a response from the facial nerve at low threshold over the entire accessible tumor surface, indicating that the tumor was a facial nerve schwannoma. Considering the patient's lack of facial nerve deficit and that the tumor exhibited no safe entry point for intracapsular debulking, tumor resection was not performed. Working between the tumor and tentorium, a branch of the superior cerebellar artery was identified and decompressed with a Teflon pad. At last follow-up, the patient exhibited resolution of her TN. Her hearing and facial nerve function remained intact.
   CONCLUSIONS: Despite obstruction from a medium-sized tumor, it is still possible to achieve microvascular decompression of the fifth cranial nerve. This emphasizes the importance of considering other actionable pathology during surgical management of presumed tumor-induced TN. Further, TN is relatively uncommon with medium-sized vestibular schwannomas and coexistent causes should be considered.

   ASTROCYTOMA; MENINGIOMA; TUMORS
AB BACKGROUND: Abscess coexisting within a brain tumor is rare. Case reports in the literature primarily consist of sellar pathology and parenchymal lesions, including meningioma, glioma, and metastases. We report a case of glioblastoma with an intratumoral abscess in a middle-aged patient with no prior invasive procedure or systemic focus of infection.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 45-year-old woman presented with new-onset generalized seizures and rapidly progressive left hemiparesis. Imaging showed a right frontal necrotic lesion with a peripherally enhancing wall and solid component posteriorly. There was no diffusion restriction within the lesion. She was afebrile, and there was no systemic focus of infection. With provisional diagnosis of malignant glioma, she underwent surgical resection of the lesion. A differential diagnosis of abscess was considered preoperatively because of the rapid increase in size of the lesion. At surgery, there was a pus-filled cavity with a few areas of grayish, soft, flimsy wall and thrombosed veins. This raised a strong suspicion of a coexisting abscess within a malignant glioma, which was confirmed by histopathologic and microbiologic examination.
   CONCLUSIONS: It is important for neurosurgeons to be aware of this rare entity. The treatment protocol remains controversial and is primarily guided by expert opinion. It is important to aggressively treat the patient with antibiotics followed by adjuvant therapy for malignancy. The timing and administration of adjuvant therapy are unclear. We suggest a delay of chemotherapy until at least 4 weeks of therapy with sensitive antibiotics.

AB OBJECTIVE: The study uses meta-regression analysis to quantify the dosedependent effects of statin pharmacotherapy on vasospasm, delayed ischemic neurologic deficits (DIND), and mortality in aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage.
   METHODS: Prospective, retrospective observational studies, and randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were retrieved by a systematic database search. Summary estimates were expressed as absolute risk (AR) for a given statin dose or control (placebo). Meta-regression using inverse variance weighting and robust variance estimation was performed to assess the effect of statin dose on transformed AR in a random effects model. Dose-dependence of predicted AR with 95% confidence interval (CI) was recovered by using Miller's Freemane Tukey inverse.
   RESULTS: The database search and study selection criteria yielded 18 studies (2594 patients) for analysis. These included 12 RCTs, 4 retrospective observational studies, and 2 prospective observational studies. Twelve studies investigated simvastatin, whereas the remaining studies investigated atorvastatin, pravastatin, or pitavastatin, with simvastatin-equivalent doses ranging from 20 to 80 mg. Meta-regression revealed dose-dependent reductions in Freemane Tukey-transformed AR of vasospasm (slope coefficient - 0.00404, 95% CI -0.00720 to -0.00087; P = 0.0321), DIND (slope coefficient - 0.00316, 95% CI -0.00586 to -0.00047; P = 0.0392), and mortality (slope coefficient - 0.00345, 95% CI - 0.00623 to -0.00067; P = 0.0352).
   CONCLUSIONS: The present meta-regression provides weak evidence for dose-dependent reductions in vasospasm, DIND and mortality associated with acute statin use after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage. However, the analysis was limited by substantial heterogeneity among individual studies. Greater dosing strategies are a potential consideration for future RCTs.

AB OBJECTIVE: Minimally invasive alternatives to the pterional craniotomy include the minipterional and the supraorbital craniotomy (SOC). The latter is performed via either an eyebrow or an eyelid skin incision. The purpose of this systematic review was to analyze the type and the incidence of approachrelated complications of these so-called "keyhole craniotomies".
   METHODS: We review pertinent articles retrieved by search in the PubMed/Medline database. Inclusion criteria were all full-text articles, abstracts, and posters in English, up to 2016, reporting clinical results.
   RESULTS: A total of 105 articles containing data on 5837 surgeries performed via a minipterional or either of the 2 variants of the SOC met the eligibility criteria. Pain on mastication was the most commonly reported approach-related complication of the minipterional approach, and occurred in 7.5% of cases. Temporary palsy of the frontal branch of the facial nerve and temporary supraorbital hypesthesia were associated with the SOC eyebrow variant, and occurred in 6.5%, respectively in 3.6% of cases. Transient postoperative periorbital edema and transient ophthalmoparesis occurred in 36.8% and 17.4% of cases, respectively, when the SOC was performed via an eyelid skin incision. The risk of occurrence of the latter 2 complications was related to the removal of the orbital rim, which is an obligatory part of the SOC approach through the eyelid but optional with the SOC eyebrow variant.
   CONCLUSIONS: Each of the 3 keyhole approaches has a specific set and incidence of approach-related complications. It is essential to be aware of these complications to make the safest individual choice.

DE CT cisternography; Microvascular decompression; Superior cerebellar
   artery; Trigeminal neuralgia
ID MICROVASCULAR DECOMPRESSION; RADIOSURGERY; COMPRESSION; NERVE
AB BACKGROUND: Trigeminal neuralgia (TGN) causes severe unilateral facial pain. The etiology is hypothesized to be segmental demyelination of the trigeminal nerve root via compression by the superior cerebellar artery (SCA). Microvascular decompression (MVD) allows immediate and long-term pain relief. Preoperative evaluation includes magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and/or magnetic resonance angiography of the brain. Having a pacemaker is a contraindication for MRI. There have been isolated reports of using computed tomography (CT) cisternography scans for radiation planning for TGN.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 75-year-old male with a permanent pacemaker who had refractory TGN in the V2 (maxillary) distribution of the trigeminal nerve underwent CT cisternography to prepare for MVD. CT angiography with Isovue 370 intravenous contrast injection and 0.625-mm axial images were obtained from the skull base across the posterior fossa. An intrathecal injection of Isovue 180 was performed at the L2/3 level. Imaging revealed the right SCA abutting the medial margin of the proximal right trigeminal nerve. In surgery (K.D.), a standard retrosigmoid suboccipital craniotomy was performed to access the cerebellopontine angle and separate the abutting SCA and trigeminal nerve. The patient had immediate pain relief.
   CONCLUSIONS: MRI is the preferred method of evaluating for TGN because it offers excellent visualization of vasculature in relation to the trigeminal nerve without accompanying radiation exposure. However, for patients who have contraindications to MRI, CT cisternography is shown to also be an effective method for visualizing the trigeminal root entry zone and nearby vasculature in preparation for MVD of the trigeminal nerve.

   of Common Central Nervous System Tumor
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
LA English
DT Article
DE Cerebral hemisphere; Exophytic growth; Frontal lobe; Low-grade glioma
ID RESECTION; EXTENT
AB BACKGROUND: Exophytic growth (EG), wherein the tumor mass grows beyond the neuraxial boundary formed by pia mater, remains a rare pattern of glioma growth. It has been described in gliomas at several locations like the brainstem, cerebellum, suprasellar area, spinal cord, and insula. However, EG in hemispheric grade 2 astrocytomas, particularly affecting the convexity subarachnoid space, as against the more spacious basal subarachnoid space, is exceedingly rare. To the best of our knowledge, there is only 1 such case reported in the English literature. Due to the extreme rarity, little is known about these tumors, particularly the mechanisms underlying the EG and their possible clinical implications.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 32-year-old woman presented with partial motor seizures without any neurologic signs. On magnetic resonance imaging of the head, a nonenhancing, T2-hyperintense, right frontal lobe lesion was noted. The majority of the lesion was occupying the adjacent subdural space while still remaining in continuity with the intra-axial globular component. During surgery, the exophytic nature of the lesion was confirmed. We performed maximal resection of the exophytic portion with subtotal excision of the intra-axial component. She recovered uneventfully after surgery and subsequently received external beam radiotherapy for the residual tumor.
   CONCLUSION: Although extremely rare, cerebral hemispheric grade 2 astrocytomas may have an EG pattern. The exact mechanisms underlying this are not clearly known. More such cases need to be reported so that we can decipher the true nature of these tumors.

   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 61-year-old male patient with neurofibromatosis type 2 presented with bilateral VS. In a long-term follow-up, both had increased in size but also showed bilateral spontaneous regression during an 11-year followup period with a "watch-and-wait" strategy.
   CONCLUSIONS: We emphasize conservative treatment ("watch and wait") in older patients even with long-term tumor progression without significant compression-related clinical symptoms.

   CIRCULATION; MANAGEMENT
AB BACKGROUND: Ruptured dissecting aneurysms located at the middle cerebral artery (MCA) are rare, and their standard treatment has not been defined. Furthermore, lenticulostriate artery involvement in the dissecting segment makes treatment extremely difficult, and no previous reports have described successful treatment for such conditions.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: We herein report the case of a 74-year-old woman who presented with sudden severe headache from subarachnoid hemorrhage due to dissection in the proximal M1 segment of left MCA involving lenticulostriate arteries. Digital subtraction angiography on day 6 showed that the dissecting aneurysm had enlarged despite strict blood pressure control. On day 8, the patient was treated successfully with a self-expanding closed cell stent and coil embolization, preserving blood flow in the lenticulostriate arteries as well as the MCA.
   CONCLUSIONS: Follow-up digital subtraction angiography performed 5 weeks after endovascular therapy showed healing of the dissecting lesion, and the patient was discharged neurologically intact.

AB PURPOSE: A 62-year-old blind man with severe ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament was presented. The patient underwent posterior laminectomy and fixation. After surgery, the patient was not satisfied with the recovery of his upper limbs although his Japanese Orthopedic Association (JOA) score had increased from 9 to 12 points. Because the tactile sensation of his hands was especially important to his daily life, the patient asked for further treatment after 6 months. This report describes the novel revision surgery we invented and the outcome in the patient after the surgery.
   METHODS: We performed the revision surgery using an anterior approach from C3 to C7 with a novel technique, anterior controllable antedisplacement and fusion (ACAF). The patient was followed up for 6 months. The clinical data, including JOA score and radiologic images, were collected and analyzed.
   RESULTS: After the revision surgery, the patient had improved sensation in both hands, and his JOA score increased to 14 points. Satisfactory decompression was assessed by magnetic resonance imaging after operation. Bone fusion was confirmed by computed tomography 3 months after operation. No specific complications related to this surgery were observed.
   CONCLUSIONS: The application of such an operative procedure in revision surgery for OPLL has not been reported earlier and might be an alternative choice for patients with an unsatisfactory outcome from previous posterior surgery.

AB BACKGROUND: Primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) is a rare malignancy that usually arises in the context of severe immunosuppression but has incompletely understood etiology, limiting effective treatments.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: We present the case of an 81-year-old immunocompetent man who developed a PCNSL in the right temporal lobe, at the site of a remote episode of herpes simplex virus (HSV) encephalitis 8 years prior. There are numerous viruses with known oncogenic associations; however, to our knowledge, this is the first reported case of PCNSL with an antecedent HSV infection.
   CONCLUSIONS: We discuss this case in the context of our current understandings of the pathogenesis of HSV encephalitis and PCNSL and postulate mechanisms through which the 2 could be associated.

   REPLACEMENT; DECOMPRESSION; MULTICENTER; OUTCOMES
AB BACKGROUND: The concern of adjacent segment disease (ASD) has led to the development of motion-preserving technologies, such as cervical disc arthroplasty (CDA). However, there is still controversy whether CDA is superior to anterior cervical decompression and fusion (ACDF) as to the incidence of ASD. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the rate of ASD between CDA and ACDF.
   METHODS: Systematic searches of all relevant studies through November 2017 were identified from the Cochrane Library, PubMed, Embase, and CNKI. Randomized controlled trials comparing the clinical effectiveness of CDA and ACDF for cervical degenerative disc disease (DDD) were included. Two independent reviewers searched and assessed all literature according to the standard of Cochrane systematic review. Data extraction and quality assessment were conducted, and RevMan 5.2 was used for data analysis. The random effects model was used if there was heterogeneity between studies; otherwise, the fixed effects model was used.
   RESULTS: Twenty-one studies were included in our meta-analysis. The pooled data revealed that the CDA group had significantly lower adjacent segment diseases than the ACDF group did. Furthermore, there were fewer adjacent segment reoperations in the CDA group compared with the ACDF group.
   CONCLUSIONS: In this meta-analysis, we conclude that CDA was better than the ACDF in terms of ASD and adjacent segment reoperations. This conclusion suggests that CDA is a superior alternative invention for the treatment of cervical DDD to preserve cervical range of motion and reduce the risk of ASD; however, this requires further validation and investigation in larger sample-size prospective and randomized studies with long-term follow-up.

AB BACKGROUND: The use of surgical cochlear nerve decompression is controversial. This study aimed at investigating the safety and validity of microsurgical decompression via an endoscope-assisted retrosigmoid approach to treat tinnitus in patients with neurovascular compression of the cochlear nerve.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: Three patients with disabling tinnitus resulting from a loop in the internal auditory canal were evaluated with magnetic resonance imaging and tests of pure tone auditory, tinnitus, and auditory brain response (ABR) to identify the features of the cochlear nerve involvement. We observed a loop with a caliber greater than 0.8 mm in all patients. Patients were treated via an endoscope-assisted retrosigmoid microsurgical decompression. After surgery, none of the patients reported short-term or long-term complications. After surgery, tinnitus resolved immediately in 2 patients, whereas in the other patient symptoms persisted although they improved; in all patients, hearing was preserved and ABR improved.
   CONCLUSION: Microsurgical decompression via endoscope-assisted retrosigmoid approach is a promising, safe, and valid procedure for treating tinnitus caused by cochlear nerve compression. This procedure should be considered in patients with disabling tinnitus who have altered ABR and a loop that has a caliber greater than 0.8 mm and is in contact with the cochlear nerve.

AB BACKGROUND: Hypoglossal nerve deficit is a possible complication caused by carotid endarterectomy (CEA). The accidental injury of the hypoglossal nerve during surgery is one of the major reasons for permanent hypoglossal nerve palsy. In this study, we investigated the usefulness of intraoperative mapping of the hypoglossal nerve to identify this nerve during CEA.
   METHODS: Five consecutive patients who underwent CEA for the treatment of symptomatic or asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis were studied. A hand-held probe was used to detect the hypoglossal nerve in the operative field, and the tongue motor evoked potentials (MEPs) were recorded.
   RESULTS: The tongue MEPs were obtained in all the patients. The invisible hypoglossal nerve was successfully identified without any difficulty when the internal carotid artery was exposed. Intraoperative mapping was particularly useful for identifying the hypoglossal nerve when the hypoglossal nerve passed beneath the posterior belly of the digastric muscle. In 1 of 2 cases, MEP was also elicited when the ansa cervicalis was stimulated, although the resulting amplitude was much smaller than that obtained by direct stimulation of the hypoglossal nerve. Post-operatively, none of the patients presented with hypoglossal nerve palsy.
   CONCLUSIONS: Intraoperative hypoglossal nerve mapping enabled us to locate the invisible hypoglossal nerve during the exposure of the internal carotid artery accurately without retracting the posterior belly of the digastric muscle and other tissues in the vicinity of the internal carotid artery.

TI Balloon Bridge: Novel Technique for Reaccessing Carotid Artery Stent
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
LA English
DT Article
DE Balloon; Carotid stent; Complication; Large-bore catheter; Occlusion;
   Step-off
AB BACKGROUND: Crossing a nascently deployed carotid artery stent (CAS) is required to perform angioplasty and filter recapture. If the traversing balloon or filter recapture catheters are eccentric or tangentially angled to the vertical axis of the CAS, they can ensnare on the ledge of the proximal CAS step-off, potentially causing life-threatening complications secondary to deformation, displacement, or mechanical occlusion of the stent. We report a novel "balloon bridge" technique that facilitates safe entry and passage across the CAS with both a balloon catheter and a large-bore guide catheter (LBGC).
   METHODS: We used the balloon bridge technique for 2 patients with >90% carotid artery stenosis and steep carotid artery angles of origin who underwent routine CAS, balloon angioplasty, and distal embolic protection. During filter recapture, the balloon was inflated across the junction of the distal LBGC tip and proximal CAS, centering the LBGC within the vessel lumen and CAS During balloon deflation, the LBGC was sequentially advanced, successfully navigating the LBGC across the proximal stent construct without resistance or complication.
   RESULTS: The balloon bridge technique was completed without complications. We believe that the mechanism of action is secondary to balloon-facilitated LBGC alignment with the true axis of the stent.
   CONCLUSIONS: Traversing a CAS with an LBGC or balloon catheter can be tedious and fraught with the potential of neurologic peril should mechanical deformation and occlusion occur. The balloon bridge technique is safe and highly effective for navigating a catheter that is eccentric or tangentially angled to the long axis of a CAS.

AB OBJECTIVE: Healthcare expenditures and cost reduction have been under critical surveillance in all countries and are critical for policymakers. This review aims at qualitatively and quantitatively analyzing the difference of hospital costs and length of stay between endovascular coiling versus neurosurgical clipping in ruptured intracranial aneurysms (RAs).
   METHODS: MEDLINE, the Cochrane database, Embase, and the Web of Science database were searched and evaluated independently by 2 authors according to the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale for cohort studies describing economic hospital cost or length of stay in patients with RAs.
   RESULTS: A total of 8 studies were included, describing 24,219 RAs treated with neurosurgical clipping and 24,962 RAs with endovascular coiling. Metaanalysis revealed that the total hospital costs (THCs) were similar between coiling versus clipping in RAs (standard mean difference [SMD], -0.05; 95% confidence interval [CI], -0.12 to 0.22; I-2 = 99%; P = 0.50). Subgroup analysis showed that THCs of clipping and coiling were similar in ruptured aneurysms in the United States. However, in South Korea, the THCs of coiling were significantly higher than clipping. In the long run, 1-year medical costs of endovascular treatment were significantly lower than that of clipping in RAs (SMD, 0.15; 95% CI, 0.05-0.25; I-2 = 66%; P = 0.005). In addition, the length of stay of coiled patients was significantly shorter than clipped patients (SMD, 0.29; 95% CI, 0.13-0.45; I-2 = 96%; P < 0.001).
   CONCLUSIONS: Medical costs were region-specified. In the United States, total hospital costs and 1-year medical costs were similar in RA patients treated with endovascular coiling and neurosurgical clipping. However, in countries like South Korea and China, coiling was more expensive. The length of stay was much shorter in coiled patients in all countries.

ID HEARING-LOSS; VENTRICULOPERITONEAL SHUNT; HYDROCEPHALUS; PLACEMENT
AB BACKGROUND: Mild hearing loss following shunting has been described; however, severe auditory impairment associated with ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt is an uncommon, rarely reported phenomenon. Treatment options and pathophysiologic considerations are discussed in this case report.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 27-year-old man who was treated for an eighth cranial nerve schwannoma with complete resection and a VP shunt 10 years previously presented to the emergency department with acute severe hearing loss and headache. Imaging showed diminished size of the ventricles and dural contrast enhancement. The previous shunt was replaced with a programmable antisiphoning VP shunt, The patient's hearing and headache improved 48 hours later, as demonstrated in serial audiograms.
   CONCLUSIONS: Hearing loss is an underestimated complication of shunting that in some cases may progress to severe impairment and deafness. Patients with a VP shunt who experience hearing loss should undergo further evaluation and possibly adjustment of shunt settings.

AB BACKGROUND: Intracranial aneurysms (IAs) are pathologic dilatations of cerebral arteries. This systematic review summarizes and compares imaging techniques for assessing unruptured IAs (UIAs). This review also addresses their uses in different scopes of practice. Pathophysiologic mechanisms are reviewed to better understand the clinical usefulness of each imaging modality.
   METHODS: A literature review was performed using PubMed with these search terms: "intracranial aneurysm," "cerebral aneurysm," " magnetic resonance angiography (MRA)," computed tomography angiography (CTA)," "catheter angiography," "digital subtraction angiography," "molecular imaging," "ferumoxytol," and "myeloperoxidase". Only studies in English were cited.
   RESULTS: Since the development and improvement of noninvasive diagnostic imaging (computed tomography angiography and magnetic resonance angiography), many prospective studies and meta-analyses have compared these tests with gold standard digital subtraction angiography (DSA). Although computed tomography angiography and magnetic resonance angiography have lower detection rates for UIAs, they are vital in the treatment and follow-up of UIAs. The reduction in ionizing radiation and lack of endovascular instrumentation with these modalities provide benefits compared with DSA. Novel molecular imaging techniques to detect inflammation within the aneurysmal wall with the goal of stratifying risk based on level of inflammation are under investigation.
   CONCLUSIONS: DSA remains the gold standard for preoperative planning and follow-up for patients with IA. Newer imaging modalities such as ferumoxytol-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging are emerging techniques that provide critical in vivo information about the inflammatory milieu within aneurysm walls. With further study, these techniques may provide aneurysm rupture risk and prediction models for individualized patient care.

AB BACKGROUND: Vascular compression of neural structures has long been established as an etiology for dysfunction of multiple cranial nerves. Classically, as is the case of trigeminal neuralgia, vascular compression by an offending artery and sometimes vein-exerting pressure at the root entry zone of the trigeminal nerve can lead to the characteristic pain syndrome.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: In these cases, microvascular decompression is an effective, durable surgical intervention to relieve the neuralgia. In this report, we present a unique case of a patient with direct compression of the medulla oblongata by an arachnoid cyst and associated vascular loops.
   CONCLUSION: Confirming our suspected pathophysiology of this case, we noted resolution of the patient's symptoms following fenestration of cyst and microvascular decompression.

AB BACKGROUND: Venous thromboembolism can be a significant cause of morbidity in the trauma population. Medical and surgical specialties have been pushing the indication for prophylactic filter placement.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 36-year-old man presented with axial lower back pain with a radicular right L2 component after lifting a heavy object. He had a history of penetrating brain trauma 3 years prior, with placement of a prophylactic inferior vena cava filter. His radiograph, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging of the lumbar spine showed fracture of his filter, with migration of the fractured fragment through the inferior vena cava and into the L2-L3 disk space, and surrounding bony lysis and severe osteodiskitis. He was treated medically with intravenous and then oral antibiotics and improved clinically and radiographically.
   CONCLUSIONS: Conservative use of filter devices and early retrieval once their indication expires are paramount to avoid unnecessary complications.

AB BACKGROUND: Ochronotic arthropathy related to alkaptonuria is a rare condition. Cervical spine involvement with myelopathic features has been even more rarely described, particularly related to atlantoaxial instability. As such, little is known about the optimal surgical management in these patients.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: We described the first case, to our knowledge, of a patient with alkaptonuria and related cervical spondylotic myelopathy from pannus formation at the atlantoaxial joint. We describe our choices in surgical management of this rare condition in a patient with an excellent outcome.
   CONCLUSION: Ochronotic cervical spondylotic myelopathy is a rare condition and may require additional considerations in surgical treatment compared to more common causes of cervical spondylotic myelopathy. In our case, we elected for decompression with posterior occipitocervical screw fixation and were able to achieve neurologic recovery with no complications, currently at 2-year follow-up.

AB The radiological signs of intracranial dural arteriovenous fistulas (ICDAVFs) are heterogenous. While it is commonly accepted that hyper intense T2 wedge magnetic resonance imaging of the brainstem and cervical cord mainly concern gliomas, it is so far uncommon and probably unknown that ICDAVFs can imitate similar radiological pattern, especially with gadolinium contrast enhancement and cord enlargement. Thus the angiography is poorly documented in the diagnostic workup. We report the unusual history of ICDAVFs, revealed by clinical and radiological features that mimicked a medulla or cervical spinal cord glioma. This observation provides information on the management of atypical lesions mimicking medulla or cervical cord glioma and arguments for a careful radiological study. Looking for dilated veins around the brainstem and the cord is mandatory in the workup of a supposed infiltrating brainstem or spinal cord lesion, in order to rule out an ICDAVF. Even if the hyperintense T2 images associated with contrast enhancement is in favor of a brainstem or spinal cord glioma, additional cerebral angiography should be mandatory. Moreover, this clinical case highlights the need for a multidisciplinary approach including neuroradiologist, oncologist and neurosurgeon.

AB BACKGROUND: Approximately 1% of all patients surviving rupture of cerebral aneurysm suffer from a second aneurysmatic subarachnoid hemorrhage later in their lives, 61% of which are caused by rupture of a de novo aneurysm. Latency between bleedings is usually many years, and younger patients tend to achieve better outcomes from a second subarachnoid hemorrhage.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: We report an unusual case of lethal ultra-early rupture of a de novo aneurysm of the anterior communicating artery only 5 months after the initial subarachnoid hemorrhage and complete coiling in a young, healthy male patient.
   CONCLUSION: Despite complete aneurysm obliteration, young age, and good recovery, patients may be subjected to secondary subarachnoid hemorrhages from de novo aneurysms after only a few months of the initial bleeding. Early-control magnetic resonance angiography might hence be advisable.

AB Internal maxillary artery (IMA) bypass has gained momentum in the last 5 years for the treatment of complex cerebrovascular disorders and skull base tumors. However, some issues regarding this treatment modality have been proposed. As one of the most experienced neurosurgical teams to perform internal maxillary artery bypass in the world (>100 clinical cases), we reviewed the literature in aspects of basic anatomy of maxillary artery with its variations to the lateral pterygoid muscle, initial anastomosis modalities, and subsequent exposure techniques in cadaver studies, preoperative arterial evaluation methods, optimal interposed graft selections, and surgical outcome in the management of complex aneurysms, skull base tumors, and steno-occlusive disorders.

AB Neuropathic pain is a subset of chronic pain that is caused by neurons that are damaged or firing aberrantly in the peripheral or central nervous systems. The treatment guidelines for neuropathic pain include antidepressants, calcium channel alpha(2) delta ligands, topical therapy, and opioids as a second-line option. Pharmacotherapy has not been effective in the treatment of neuropathic pain except in the treatment of trigeminal neuralgia with carbamazepine. The inability to properly treat neuropathic pain causes frustration in both the patients and their treating physicians. Venoms, which are classically believed to be causes of pain and death, have peptide components that have been implicated in pain relief. Although some venoms are efficacious and have shown benefits in patients, their side-effect profile precludes their more widespread use. This review identifies and explores the use of venoms in neuropathic pain relief. This treatment can open doors to potential therapeutic targets. We believe that further research into the mechanisms of action of these receptors as well as their functions in nature will provide alternative therapies as well as a window into how they affect neuropathic pain.

AB OBJECTIVE: To quantitatively assess and compare the effectiveness and safety of posterior fossa decompression with duraplasty (PFDD) and posterior fossa decompression (PFD) in treating patients with Chiari malformation type I.
   METHODS: PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library were searched through May 2017. Fourteen cohort studies comprising 3666 patients with Chiari malformation type I were included. Studies were pooled, and the relative risk (RR) and corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated.
   RESULTS: The decrease in syringomyelia was better in patients in the PFDD group than in patients in the PFD group (RR = 1.57, 95% CI = 1.07-2.32, P-heterogeneity = 0.042, I-2 = 56.6%). The incidence of cerebrospinal fluid leak (RR = 5.23, 95% CI = 2.61-10.51, P-heterogeneity = 0.830, I-2 = 0%) and aseptic meningitis (RR [4.02, 95% CI = 1.46-11.03, P-heterogeneity = 0.960, I-2 = 0%) significantly increased among patients in the PFDD group compared with patients in the PFD group. When stratifying by age, a significantly reduced risk in the reoperation rate was observed in the adult group. However, the clinical improvement and the incidence of wound infection were not significantly different between the 2 groups.
   CONCLUSIONS: This study confirmed that the decrease in syringomyelia was better for patients treated with PFDD than for patients treated with PFD alone. However, no significant difference was found in the clinical improvement and the reoperation rate between the 2 groups.

TI Is Edema a Matter of Concern After Laser Ablation of Epileptogenic
   Focus?
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
LA English
DT Article
DE Edema; Epilepsy; Laser ablation; Laser interstitial thermal therapy;
   Quantitative analysis
ID INTERSTITIAL THERMAL THERAPY; LITT
AB BACKGROUND: A stereotactically placed laser fiber can deliver thermal energy to an epileptogenic focus in the brain. This procedure is done under intraoperative (thermography) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) guidance. Thermoablation can lead to edema in the surrounding area and can cause a secondary insult. In this report of 3 cases, we have quantified the edema produced after laser ablation by sequential MRI in the immediate postoperative period.
   CASE DESCRIPTIONS: Three patients with intractable epilepsy underwent detailed neurologic and neuroradiologic workup to localize the site of epileptogenic foci. Two of the patients had mesial temporal lobe sclerosis, and the other patient had hypothalamic hamartoma. A laser fiber was placed stereotactically in the epileptogenic zone, and MRI-guided thermoablation was done. Postoperatively, T1-weighted and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR)based volumetric MRI sequences were performed on postoperative days 1, 3, and 5 to quantify the edema. I-Plan software was used for volumetric analysis. Targeted volumes were 0.22, 42, and 3.5 mL, and lesions were 0.3, 6.5, and 6 mL, respectively. FLAIR hyperintensity was 2.3, 11.8, and 8.4 mL on the first postoperative day and 1.5, 12.6, and 6.3 mL on postoperative day 8. All patients remained seizure-free during the postoperative period. No complications were observed.
   CONCLUSIONS: Laser ablation of epileptic focus is safe. FLAIR hyperintensity in the postoperative period is 3-5 times the targeted volume. However, no significant increase occurs during the first 8 days, and thus steroids can be stopped within 5 days of surgery.

TI Necessity of Repeat Computed Tomography Imaging in Isolated Mild
   Traumatic Subarachnoid Hemorrhage
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
LA English

ID BRAIN-INJURY; INTRACRANIAL HEMORRHAGE; HEAD-INJURY; CT SCANS;
   COAGULATION; RISK; PROGRESSION; IMPACT
AB BACKGROUND: The standard of care for mild isolated traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage (itSAH) involves serial head computed tomography (CT) examinations at dedicated time intervals to monitor neurologic status and hemorrhagic progression. Considering recent evidence questioning such an aggressive monitoring protocol, this study aimed to assess the necessity of repeat head CT imaging in managing itSAH.
   METHODS: All patients who presented to our academic institution with mild traumatic brain injury were evaluated. Patients >= 18 years of age presenting with mild, blunt itSAH (Glasgow Coma Scale [GCS] score 13-15) were included. Patients with significant polytrauma or coagulopathy were excluded. Patient demographics (age and sex), imaging results (CT progression), and outcomes (final GCS score, discharge status, interventions, and 30-day readmission) were all recorded.
   RESULTS: Of 190 cases identified for inclusion, 58 (30.5%) met all study criteria (age, 59.5 +/- 18.0 y; 30 men). Five (8.6%) patients presented with repeat CT progression, with none reporting 30-day readmission or adverse event on follow-up. Comparison of cases with and without CT progression found no meaningful differences in age or sex. Of the 3 patients readmitted, none demonstrated CT progression, and cause of readmission was unrelated to head trauma in all cases. Two patients demonstrated clinical deterioration (final GCS score <14), and neither case showed progression on CT, was readmitted, or received neurosurgical intervention of any kind.
   CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that serial CT imaging has little efficacy in changing mild itSAH management and is poorly correlated with clinical progression. A less aggressive management protocol may he more appropriate for managing this patient population.

AB This article is the first in a series of 3 articles that seek to provide readers with an understanding of the development of neurosurgery in East Africa (Foundations), the challenges that arise in providing neurosurgical care in developing countries (Challenges), and an overview of traditional and novel approaches to overcoming these challenges to improve healthcare in the region (Innovations). We review the history and evolution of neurosurgery as a clinical specialty in East Africa. We also review Kenya, Uganda, and Tanzania in some detail and highlight contributions of individuals and local and regional organizations that helped to develop and shape neurosurgical care in East Africa. Neurosurgery has developed steadily as advanced techniques have been adopted by local surgeons who trained abroad, and foreign surgeons who have dedicated part of their careers in local hospitals. New medical schools and surgical training programs have been established through regional and international partnerships, and the era of regional specialty surgical training has just begun. As more surgical specialists complete training, a comprehensive estimation of disease burden facing the neurosurgical field is important. We present an overview with specific reference to neurotrauma and neural tube defects, both of which are of epidemiologic importance as they gain not only greater recognition, but increased diagnoses and demands for treatment. Neurosurgery in East Africa is poised to blossom as it seeks to address the growing needs of a growing subspecialty.

AB As the second of 3 articles in this series, the aim of this article is to provide readers with an understanding of the development of neurosurgery in East Africa (foundations), the challenges that arise in providing neurosurgical care in developing countries (challenges), and an overview of traditional and novel approaches to overcoming these challenges and improving health care in the region (innovations). Recognizing the challenges that need to be addressed is the first step to implementing efficient and qualified surgery delivery systems in low- and middle-income countries. We reviewed the major challenges facing health care in East Africa and grouped them into 5 categories: 1) burden of surgical disease and workforce crisis; 2) global health view of surgery as "the neglected stepchild"; 3) need for recognizing the surgical system as an interdependent network and importance of organizational and equipment deficits; 4) lack of education in the community, failure of primary care systems, and net result of overwhelming tertiary care systems; 5) personal and professional burnout as well as brain drain of promising human resources from low- and middle-income countries in East Africa and similar regions across the world. Each major challenge was detailed and analyzed by authors who have worked or are currently working in the region, providing a personal perspective.

AB In the last 10 years, considerable work has been done to promote and improve neurosurgical care in East Africa with the development of national training programs, expansion of hospitals and creation of new institutions, and the foundation of epidemiologic and cost-effectiveness research. Many of the results have been accomplished through collaboration with partners from abroad. This article is the third in a series of articles that seek to provide readers with an understanding of the development of neurosurgery in East Africa (Foundations), the challenges that arise in providing neurosurgical care in developing countries (Challenges), and an overview of traditional and novel approaches to overcoming these challenges to improve healthcare in the region (Innovations). In this article, we describe the ongoing programs active in East Africa and their current priorities, and we outline lessons learned and what is required to create self-sustained neurosurgical service.

ID BRAIN-TUMOR RESECTION; CLINICAL ARTICLE; GLIOMA RESECTION; SURGERY;

AB BACKGROUND: In this initial series, we evaluated the use of microvascular decompression (MVD) tinder an awake anesthesia protocol ("awake" MVD) to assess whether intraoperative pain evaluation can identify and mitigate insufficient decompression of the trigeminal nerve, improving surgical outcomes, and possibly expand the indications of MVD in patients with comorbidities that would preclude the use of general endotracheal anesthesia (GEA).
   METHODS: An Institutional Review Board-approved prospective study of 10 consecutive adults who underwent MVD for trigeminal neuralgia (TN) was conducted. The primary outcome measure was postoperative TN pain quantified on the Barrow Neurological Institute (BNI) Pain Severity Scale.
   RESULTS: The median patient age was 65.5 years, with a female:male ratio of 6:4. All 10 patients tolerated the procedure well and did not require GEA intraoperatively or postoperatively. Nine patients had a successful surgical outcome (BNI score I, n = 5; BNI score II, n = 4). One patient did not have pain relief (BNI score IV). This same patient also developed a pseudomeningocele, which was the sole surgical complication observed in this series. One patient experienced recurrence of pain at 11 months, with BNI score increasing from I to II. The median duration of follow-up was 16.5 months. Two patients did not experienced resolution of evoked pain during intraoperative awake testing following decompression. Further intraoperative exploration revealed secondary offending vessels that were subsequently decompressed, leading to resolution of pain.
   CONCLUSIONS: Intraoperative awake testing for treatment efficacy may increase the success rate of MVD by rapidly identifying and mitigating insufficient cranial nerve V decompression.

ID CORD INJURIES; NIGERIA
AB BACKGROUND: Subaxial spinal injury surgery is expensive, and its significance is uncertain because of limited rehabilitation and postoperative care.
   OBJECTIVE: To assess complications and outcome in patients surgically treated for subaxial spinal injuries in 2 hospitals in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.
   METHODS: Retrospective study, conducted among 85 patients operated on for subaxial spine injury from January 2013 to August 2016. Data were collected from medical charts. Descriptive statistics and binary logistic regression were used for data analysis.
   RESULTS: A total of 85 patients were included, and 20 patients were not followed up. The mean age was 33 years (standard deviation +/- 12.03 years), and the mean time from injury to surgery was 10 days. The rates of surgical mortality and reoperation were 7.05% and 3.5%, respectively. Deaths occurred in 13 of 16 patients (81.1%) with American Spine Injury Association (ASIA) scores of A and in 3 of 16 patients (18.9%) with ASIA scores of B. The complication rate in patients with a preoperative ASIA score of A was 17/24 (70.8%). The study showed that 55 of 65 patients who were followed up (84.6%; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 75.4, 92.3) experienced improvement. According to the patients' follow-up ASIA scores, 47 (72.3%; 95% CI: 61.5, 83.1) were functional. Sphincter tone before operation (adjusted odds ratio 142.82; 95% CI: 9.973, 204.090) was significantly associated with follow-up ASIA score.
   CONCLUSIONS: Patients with complete cervical injuries had high rates of mortality and morbidity, indicating that it might be better not to operate on these patients in resource-limited settings. There is a moderate recovery rate in patients with incomplete SCI despite a lack of adequate rehabilitation facilities.

   hematoma; Subdural hematoma follow-up; Subdural hematoma risk factors
AB OBJECTIVE: To study the prognoses of patients with subdural hematoma (SDH) who were not operated on at the time of the first diagnosis and the causes of enlarged hematomas in some patients during the follow-up period.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: The records, service files, and radiologic examination results of the patients with diagnoses of SDH were reviewed. The SDH patients were recorded under 5 different categories: acute SDH (ASDH), subacute SDH (SSDH), chronic SDH (CSDH), acute component with chronic SDH (A-CSDH), and subacute component with chronic SDH (S-CSDH). The symptoms, clinical findings, and progression in the patients were correlated with radiologic examinations.
   RESULTS: A total of 291 patients received diagnoses of SDHs: 80 patients with acute, 29 patients with subacute, and 163 patients with chronic hematoma. Thirty-five patients had diagnoses of SDH with a combination of different components. It was determined that in the follow-up period, patients with A-CSDH showed the greatest increase in hematoma size over time and required surgical intervention the most often.
   CONCLUSION: SDHs reveal different prognoses in different age groups. Multicomponent SDHs are within the group that shows the greatest increase in size in the follow-up period. SDHs and CSDHs cause recurrent hemorrhages by sustaining the tension on the bridging veins. The greater the hematoma volume, the greater the growth potential of the hematoma tends to be. CSDHs that do not manifest changes in volume for a long time can be monitored without surgical intervention as long as the clinical picture remains stable.

AB OBJECTIVE: To investigate the role of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors in the recurrence of chronic subdural hematoma (cSDH) after burr hole surgery.
   METHODS: A retrospective review was conducted of a Scandinavian multicenter, population-based cohort of 1252 adults with cSDH who underwent with burr hole surgery between January 1, 2005, and December 31, 2010. The risk of cSDH recurrence was assessed in users of ACE inhibitors, users of angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs), and those without ACE inhibitor treatment (no ACE inhibitor group) using univariable and multivariable regression analyses.
   RESULTS: The cohort included 98 (7.8%) ACE inhibitor users and 63 (5%) ARB-only users. The recurrence rate was 16.3% (n = 16) in the ACE inhibitor group, compared with 13.3% (n = 153) in the no ACE inhibitor group (P = 0.39) and 14.3% (n = 9) in the ARB group (P = 0.73). When comparing groups, age (P = 0.01), Charlson Comorbidity Index (P = 0.01), use of platelet inhibitors (P = 0.001) and use of anticoagulants (P = 0.01) differed between the ACE inhibitor and no ACE inhibitor groups. Only age differed significantly between the ACE inhibitor and ARB groups (P = 0.03). In the analyses adjusted for differences in baseline characteristics, ACE inhibitor treatment did not influence the risk of recurrence (odds ratio, 1.2; 95% confidence interval, 0.7-2.2; P = 0.46).
   CONCLUSION: In this population-based study, the use of ACE inhibitors was not associated with the risk of recurrence following burr hole surgery for cSDH.

AB OBJECTIVE: Fluorescence-guided surgery with protoporphyrin IX (PpIX) as a photodiagnostic marker is gaining acceptance for resection of malignant gliomas. Current wide-field imaging technologies do not have sufficient sensitivity to detect low PpIX concentrations. We evaluated a scanning fiber endoscope (SFE) for detection of PpIX fluorescence in gliomas and compared it to an operating microscope (OPMI) equipped with a fluorescence module and to a benchtop confocal laser scanning microscope (CLSM).
   METHODS: 5-Aminolevulinic acid-induced PpIX fluorescence was assessed in GL261-Luc2 cells in vitro and in vivo after implantation in mouse brains, at an invading glioma growth stage, simulating residual tumor. Intraoperative fluorescence of high and low PpIX concentrations in normal brain and tumor regions with SFE, OPMI, CLSM, and histopathology were compared.
   RESULTS: SFE imaging of PpIX correlated to CLSM at the cellular level. PpIX accumulated in normal brain cells but significantly less than in glioma cells. SFE was more sensitive to accumulated PpIX in fluorescent brain areas than OPMI (P < 0.01) and dramatically increased imaging time (>6x) before tumor-to-background contrast was diminished because of photobleaching.
   CONCLUSIONS: SFE provides new endoscopic capabilities to view PpIX-fluorescing tumor regions at cellular resolution. SFE may allow accurate imaging of 5-aminolevulinic acid labeling of gliomas and other tumor types when current detection techniques have failed to provide reliable visualization. SFE was significantly more sensitive than OPMI to low PpIX concentrations, which is relevant to identifying the leading edge or metastasizing cells of malignant glioma or to treating low-grade gliomas. This new application has the potential to benefit surgical outcomes.

AB BACKGROUND: A major drawback to use of cortical bone trajectory pedicle screws (CBTPSs) with traditional posterior lumbar interbody fusion (PLIF) and transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion grafts is that traditional graft insertion trajectories require wider posterior exposure. This wider exposure, beyond the limits otherwise required for CBTPS placement, negates a primary benefit of CBTPS fixation. The aim of this study was to define an alternative surgical technique for interbody graft placement that, when used in conjunction with CBTPS fixation, permits both minimal soft tissue dissection and optimal graft placement.
   METHODS: A team of neurosurgeons specializing in treatment of spinal pathologies developed a surgical technique for insertion of bilateral PLIF grafts that complements the principles of CBTPS fixation. This technique is illustrated in a patient undergoing lumbosacral decompression, CBTPS fixation, and 3-column arthrodesis.
   RESULTS: The described technique uses a divergent trajectory of bilateral PLIF grafts rather than the traditional parallel or convergent trajectories.
   CONCLUSIONS: By aiming medially to laterally with the interbody graft, one recapitulates many advantages of CBTPSs, including avoidance of wide tissue dissection, greater intergraft volume available for bone grafting, and greater graft coverage of the hypophyseal ring. The prospective collection of outcome data for patients who undergo lumbosacral fusion using the divergent PLIF technique is ongoing.

   DRUGS; PREVENTION; IMPACT; TESTS
AB OBJECTIVE: Demographic changes are leading to an aging society with a growing number of patients with cardiovascular diseases, relying on antiplatelet drugs like acetylsalicylic acid (ASA). Although antiplatelet agents are suspected to be protective not only in the cardiologic but in the neurovascular field, the alteration of the coagulating process could have a major impact on the course and outcome after rupture of intracranial aneurysms.
   METHODS: Between June 1999 and December 2014, 1422 patients were treated for aneurysmal SAH in our institution, 144 (10.1%) with continuous ASA at the time of aneurysm rupture. A matched-pair analysis was performed.
   RESULTS: The rate of patients with continuous ASA treatment while rupture of the aneurysm is rising significantly (P < 0.01). Those patients were significantly older than patients without ASA (60 vs. 53 years, P < 0.001). ASA-treated patients more often had aneurysmal rebleeding (4.7% vs. 2.3%, P = 0.3) and treatment-related hemorrhagic complications (13.9% vs. 6.2%, P = 0.06). However, rates were not different in microsurgical or endovascular procedures (16.4% vs. 12.2%, P = 0.6). Favorable outcome (Modified Rankin Scale 0-2) was achieved in 49.3% of the ASA group and 52.1% of the control group (P = 0.7).
   CONCLUSION: Patients with continuous ASA treatment were significantly older than patients without ASA, but there was no difference in admission status or bleeding pattern. Outcome was not different in the matched-pair analysis. There was no statistical difference in treatment related-complication rates of microsurgical and endovascular procedures. Therefore, ASA use should not influence treatment decision of the ruptured aneurysm.

AB OBJECTIVE: To investigate clinical efficacy of and optimal therapeutic strategy for ventricular intracranial pressure monitoring (V-ICPM) in patients with traumatic bifrontal contusions (TBCs).
   METHODS: From 8760 patients with traumatic brain injury treated between January 2010 and January 2016, a retrospective analysis was performed on 105 patients with TBCs who underwent V-ICPM and 282 patients with TBCs who did not. All patients underwent treatment at the 101st Hospital of PLA, Wuxi, China. Rates of successful conservative treatment, decompressive craniectomy, and bifrontal craniotomy; incidence of neurologic dysfunction; length of stay; and medical expenses were compared between groups.
   RESULTS: Glasgow Outcome Scale was used to assess all patients during follow-up (range, 6 months to 5.5 years). There were no significant differences in prognosis between the 2 groups (P = 0.100). Compared with the patients who did not undergo V-ICPM, the V-ICPM group had a significantly better successful conservative treatment rate (64.8% vs. 47.2%, P = 0.002), decompressive craniectomy rate (8.1% vs. 22.1%, P = 0.008), and bifrontal craniotomy rate (5.7% vs. 15.6%, P = 0.01); shorter length of stay (P = 0.000); and lower medical expenses (P = 0.004).
   CONCLUSIONS: Patients with TBCs should be strictly, closely, and dynamically observed by neurosurgery intensive care unit physicians and nurses. Patients should undergo ventricular intracranial pressure probe implantation in a timely manner. V-ICPM can help optimize treatment. Although V-ICPM did not significantly improve the prognosis of patients, it had many other advantages. V-ICPM warrants further clinical research and may be beneficial for patients with TBCs.

AB BACKGROUND: Despite multimodal therapies extending patient survival, glioblastoma (GBM) recurrence is all but a certainty. To date, there are few single-center studies of reoperations. Our study aimed to assess GBM reoperation trends nationally in older patients, with emphasis on outcomes.
   METHODS: The linked Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)-Medicare database was searched to identify patients 66 years and older with GBM from 1997 to 2010. The primary outcome was survival after diagnosis. Kaplan-Meier curves and multivariate analysis with proportional hazard ratios were used.
   RESULTS: Three thousand nine hundred sixty-three patients with recurrent GBM who initially received a surgical resection were identified (mean age = 74.7 years). Four hundred ninety-six (12%) of the patients with recurrent GBM underwent at least one reoperation at an average of 7.2 months after the initial diagnosis. Reoperation increased survival in patients compared with those who did not have surgical resection (12 vs. 5 months; P< 0.0001; hazard ratio [HR] = 0.666). Within the reoperated cohort, gross total resection improved median survival over subtotal resection (HR = 0.779). Two or more reoperations upon GBM recurrence improved survival to 17 months (P = 0.002). The overall complication rate was 21.7% in the initial resection-only group, versus 20.4% in the 1-reoperation group and 25.3% in the 2-reoperation group.
   CONCLUSIONS: Although definitive conclusions cannot be made given the lack of granularity, our national database study supports gross total resection as the initial treatment of choice, followed by reoperation at the time of recurrence, if tolerated, even in older patients.

AB BACKGROUND: Posttraumatic hydrocephalus (PTH) and posthemorrhagic hydrocephalus (PHH) were previously considered not suitable for neuroendoscopic treatment. New hydrocephalus theories support possible successful neuroendoscopy in such patients.
   METHODS: This study presents the results of neuroendoscopy in PTH and PHH with a background analysis. From 130 hydrocephalic patients after neuroendoscopic surgeries, 35 cases with PTH (n = 11) or PHH (n = 24; acute: n = 9, subacute: n = 10, chronic: n = 5) were found. The success rate (Glasgow Outcome Scale [GOS] score 4 or 5 without shunt) and clinical outcome (GOS score) of endoscopic third ventriculostomy (ETV) were analyzed. During the study period, 34 patients had ventriculoperitoneal shunts implanted, including 2 PTH and 5 PHH patients (all chronic).
   RESULTS: The success rate of ETV in PTH was 54.5%. In acute PHH, the success rate was 33.3%, 42.8% after excluding devastating hematomas. A post-ETV shunt was implanted in 1 patient (massive subarachnoid hemorrhage [SAH]) with final GOS score of 5. In subacute cases, the ETV success rate was 40% (no post-ETV shunts). In chronic PHH, only 1 patient with a GOS score of 5 was shunt-free (20%). The cause of ETV failure was massive SAH. Low final GOS score was caused by the extent of intracerebral bleeding or extracranial problems. The main indications for primary shunt implantation in PTH and PHH were infectious complications. The rate of good outcomes was 0% in PTH and 40% in PHH.
   CONCLUSIONS: The best results of neuroendoscopy were achieved in PTH and acute PHH. ETV failures were associated with massive SAH; arachnoid cistern blockage and scarring precludes ETV success.

AB OBJECTIVE: Oncologic treatments increase the incidence of spinal metastases. Surgical treatment of spinal metastases results in a high complication rate, which must set against the expected benefits. The aim of this article was to study the effect of several prognostic factors on surgical complications and survival time using an extended database of patients with spinal metastases.
   METHODS: This retrospective study comprised 337 patients with spinal metastases who were surgically treated between 2008 and 2015. Demographic and clinical features, oncologic histories, surgical interventions, and end results were collected. Descriptive statistical methods were used to analyze the cohort of patients. Kaplan-Meier formula and log-rank test were used to examine overall survival times.
   RESULTS: Median overall survival time was 222 days (range, 175-274 days). Age, preoperative motor disorders, preoperative Frankel grade categories, Karnofsky performance scale, type of primary tumor, and presence of internal metastasis had a significant negative effect on overall survival. Complications such as bleeding or need for intensive care could be predicted preoperatively based on preoperative performance status, type of primary tumor, affected vertebral levels, and type of surgical interventions.
   CONCLUSIONS: Spinal metastatic disease is a challenging surgical problem. If the exact prognostic factors are known preoperatively, surgical outcome and overall survival can be predicted more precisely. Our results could provide a basis for a future multicenter prospective study to determine the best treatment protocol for patients with spinal metastases.

AB OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to report data on a multimodal monitoring strategy based on the intraoperative use of neurophysiological monitoring, flowmetry by microflow probe, and intraoperative indocyanine green video angiography (ICG-VA) during microsurgical clipping of intracranial aneurysms.
   METHODS: This retrospective analysis was performed on 85 consecutive patients undergoing clipping of 96 intracranial aneurysms with the present monitoring strategy. Patient outcomes were evaluated by assessing rate of aneurysm exclusion and postoperative occurrence of ischemic injury. Intraoperative data for the strategy in addition to changes in each monitoring technique depending on aneurysm features were reported.
   RESULTS: Complete aneurysm exclusion was achieved in 98.9% of cases. Postoperative symptomatic ischemic injury was recorded in 2.08 degrees/0 aneurysms. Clip repositioning occurred in 40.6% of cases: because of motor evoked potential (MEP) decrease in 9.3%, flowmetry in 22.91%, and ICG-VA in 8.3% of treated aneurysms (1.05% after ICG injection, 7.4% after the squeezing maneuver). The role of each technique differed according to aneurysm features; flowmetry alterations occurred more frequently in distal than in proximal aneurysms (P = 0.0001) and in atherosclerotic aneurysms (P = 0.0001). MEP impairment occurred more often in proximal aneurysms (P < 0.05). ICG-VA disclosed remnant aneurysms mainly in atherosclerotic aneurysms (P< 0.05); only one false negative remnant neck was recorded with a negative predictive value of 98.8%.
   CONCLUSIONS: Microsurgical clipping assisted by a multimodal monitoring strategy achieved a high rate of aneurysm exclusion with low morbidity in our series. Our data show that the 3 techniques used in our strategy were complementary and that a monitoring strategy can be tailored to aneurysm features.

AB OBJECTIVE: To report long-term results after Pipeline Embolization Device (PED) implantation, characterize complex and standard aneurysms comprehensively, and introduce a modified flow disruption scale.
   METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed a consecutive series of 40 patients harboring 59 aneurysms treated with 54 PEDs. Aneurysm complexity was assessed using our proposed classification. Immediate angiographic results were analyzed using previously published grading scales and our novel flow disruption scale.
   RESULTS: According to our new definition, 46 (78%) aneurysms were classified as complex. Most PED interventions were performed in the paraophthalmic and cavernous internal carotid artery segments. Excellent neurologic outcome (modified Rankin Scale 0 and 1) was observed in 94% of patients. Our data showed low permanent procedure-related mortality (0%) and morbidity (3%) rates. Long-term angiographic follow-up showed complete occlusion in 81% and near-total obliteration in a further 14%. Complete obliteration after deployment of a single PED was achieved in all standard aneurysms with 1-year follow-up. Our new scale was an independent predictor of aneurysm occlusion in a multivariable analysis. All aneurysms with a high flow disruption grade showed complete occlusion at follow-up regardless of PED number or aneurysm complexity.
   CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with the PED should be recognized as a primary management strategy for a highly selected cohort with predominantly complex intracranial aneurysms. We further show that a priori assessment of aneurysm complexity and our new postinterventional angiographic flow disruption scale predict occlusion probability and may help to determine the adequate number of per-aneurysm devices.

AB BACKGROUND: Transnasal endoscopic approaches to the clivus have been established recently. Comparative analyses with classic lateral approaches are limited. In this study, we compared transnasal endoscopic and lateral approaches to the clivus, quantifying the exposure and working volume of each approach in the anatomy laboratory.
   METHODS: High-resolution computed tomography scans were performed on 5 injected specimens (10 sides). In each specimen, transnasal endoscopic approaches (i.e., paraseptal, transrostral, extended transrostral, transethmoidal, and extended transclival without and with intradural hypophysiopexy) and lateral approaches (i.e., retrosigmoid, far-lateral, presigmoid retrolabyrinthine and translabyrinthine) to the clivus were performed. An optic neuronavigation system and dedicated software (ApproachViewer; Guided Therapeutics Program, University Health Network, Toronto, Ontario, Canada) were used to quantify the working volume and exposed clival area of each approach. Statistical evaluation was performed with the Kruskal-Wallis test and Steel-Dwass-Critchlow-Fligner post hoc test.
   RESULTS: Endoscopic transnasal transclival approaches showed higher working volume and larger clival exposure compared with lateral approaches. Incremental volumetric values were evident for transnasal approaches; presigmoid approaches provided less working volume than retrosigmoid approaches. A transnasal transclival approach with hypophysiopexy provided significant exposure of the upper clivus (84.4%). The transrostral approach was the first transnasal approach providing satisfactory access to the midclivus (66%); retrosigmoid and far-lateral approaches provided exposure of approximately one half of the midclivus. The lower clivus was optimally exposed with endoscopic transclival approaches (83%), whereas access to this region was limited with lateral approaches.
   CONCLUSIONS: This quantitative anatomic study shows that endoscopic transnasal approaches to the clivus provide a larger working volume and wider exposure of the clivus compared with lateral approaches.

AB BACKGROUND: Pedicle screw and translaminar screw fixation in C2 may not be applicable in many patients with anatomic abnormalities or narrow laminar thickness and spinous process height. The aim of this study was to assess morphometric and mechanical feasibilities of a novel alternative screw trajectory that pierces the bifid base of C2.
   METHODS: Anatomic measurements that determined the feasibility of spinous process bifid base (SPB) screw fixation were assessed in 14 cadaveric C2 vertebrae. Pullout tests to assess ultimate fixation strength for 3 screw trajectories (transpedicular, translaminar, and SPB) were performed in cadaveric vertebrae for comparison.
   RESULTS: Anatomic measurements included mean spinous process height (10.4 +/- 4.2 mm) and mean bilateral bifid base length (10.1 + 2.2 mm) and thickness (left, 4.4 +/- 1.0 mm; right, 4.3 +/- 0.9 mm). In 64% (9/14) of specimens, bifid base length was >= 9 mm. Mean pullout strength for transpedicle, translaminar, and SPB screws in 9 viable specimens was 648 + 305 N, 628 divided by 417 N, and 755 + 279 N.
   CONCLUSIONS: SPB screw fixation may be viable anatomically and mechanically for C2 fixation. Feasibility of SPB screw fixation is determined by length, thickness, and mutual angle of the bilateral bifid bases. Patients with thin (<4 nun) and short (<9 nn) bifid bases are not likely to be suitable candidates. SPB screw fixation shows potential as an alternative approach or a salvage technique for patients with high-riding vertebral arteries or severely thin C2 lamina and warrants further investigation.

AB BACKGROUND: Although most surgeons are using endoscopy as an adjunct to microscopy in microvascular decompression, a full endoscopic technique is less commonly performed. The present study is aimed to evaluate results of 230 patients of endoscopic vascular decompression.
   METHODS: A retrospective study was carried out in a tertiary care hospital. Patients with typical neuralgia, with or without preoperatively detected vascular compression, were advised to undergo vascular decompression.
   RESULTS: Maxillary and mandibular division were involved in 116 and 204, 93 patients, respectively. Superior cerebellar (n = 174) artery was most common vascular conflict followed by anterior inferior cerebellar artery (n = 96). Tortuous basilar artery and small veins were possible causes of neuralgia in 1 and 2 patients, respectively. Single- and double-vessel conflict were observed in 173 and 50 patients, respectively. The compressing vessel was placed anterior to the trigeminal nerve in 39 patients. An arterial loop was in contact with the nerve, producing grooving, and displacing the nerve in 215, 35, and 21 patients, respectively. Complete, satisfactory, and no relief of pain were observed in 204 (88.7%), 11 (5.8%), and 15 (6.5%) patients, respectively. Recurrence was observed in 25 patients at an average follow-up of 60 months. Temporary complications included trigeminal dysesthesia, vertigo, facial paresis, CSF leak, and reduced hearing in 9, 8, 8, 7, and 3 patients, respectively.
   CONCLUSION: Endoscopic vascular decompression is a safe and efficient alternative technique to endoscopic assisted microvascular decompression provided surgeon is experienced in endoscopic surgery. It is helpful in identification of all offending vessels including the double vessel, and anterior compression without brain and nerve retraction.

ID SPONDYLOTIC MYELOPATHY; CLINICAL ARTICLE; SURGERY
AB BACKGROUND: Laminectomy, using a high-speed drill with an unprotected cutting drill bit, can be rapid and effective, but it has been associated with known complications. Another technique uses a pediatric craniotome drill with the footplate attachment. At present, there are no studies comparing clinical outcomes between these 2 stated decompressive techniques.
   METHODS: A retrospective review was conducted at a single institution. Two cohorts of patients were considered based on the technical method of laminectomy for decompression. One group had decompression with utilization of a high-speed drill, whereas the other group had decompression with a pediatric craniotome drill with a footplate attachment. The outcomes from each group were compared based on the length of operation, estimated blood loss, and associated complications.
   RESULTS: A total of 91 patients were included in the final analysis. Forty-five of the patients underwent laminectomy using a footplate and 46, using a high-speed drill. The footplate group was associated with significantly shorter operative time (159 vs. 205 minutes; P = 0.008). In addition, the footplate technique demonstrated less estimated blood loss (254 vs. 349 mL), and less incidence of durotomies (2.2% vs. 10.9%); however, neither of these 2 outcomes achieved statistical significance.
   CONCLUSIONS: Despite being an older technique, there was a shorter operative time in the footplate group without increased blood loss or incidence of durotomy. Although comparable results are operator dependent, this technique is a safe alternative for performing cervical and thoracic laminectomies.

AB BACKGROUND: Infertility is one of many complications of spinal cord injury (SCI) in male patients, who are often at the peak of their reproductive life. This study evaluated effects of hyperbaric therapy (HT) on quality of sperm of rats with SCI and correlated the findings with histologic analysis of the testicles.
   METHODS: This experimental study comprised 18 rats that were submitted to SCI with a MASCIS Impactor and randomly allocated to either a HT or a control group. Testicular biopsies were performed on the first and 28th day of the study; 4 parameters were evaluated: concentration of sperm per mL, number of round cells per field, number of inflammatory cells per field (peroxidase [Endtz] test), and sperm viability (hypo-osmotic swelling test).
   RESULTS: There was no difference in sperm concentration between the HT group (P = 0.41) and control group (P = 0.74) during 28 days. From day 1 to day 28, sperm viability decreased twice as much in the control group (P = 0.001) compared with the HT group (P = 0.017). There was no difference between the groups in mean sperm concentration and number of round and inflammatory cells. On the first day, there was no difference in sperm viability between groups. There was a significantly higher (P = 0.001) percentage of viable sperm in the HT group (86.8 +/- 5.6) compared with the control group (48.8 +/- 21.8) on day 28.
   CONCLUSIONS: SCI increased the number of round and inflammatory cells and diminished sperm viability in both groups. HT promoted greater sperm viability in rats with SCI.

   BACKGROUND: Complete fracture dislocation and subluxation (>100%) of 1 vertebral body in the coronal or sagittal plane with respect to the adjacent vertebra is defined as spondyloptosis. In coronal spondyloptosis the subluxated vertebral bodies lie beside each other, and the condition is lateraloptosis.
   Patients with lateraloptosis present unique surgical challenges because reduction and achieving realignment of spinal column require meticulous planning and execution.
   METHODS: A retrospective analysis of patients admitted with lateraloptosis over a 4-year period (2013-2016) was done. Lateraloptosis was defined on computed tomography as complete subluxation of the spinal column with more than 50% of adjacent vertebral bodies lying directly lateral to each other.
   RESULTS: Five men, ranging from 18 to 50 years (mean, 35.2 years) old were included in the study. Three patients had thoracic spine lateraloptosis, and in 2 the injury was at the thoracolumbar junction. All patients underwent single-stage posterior surgical reduction and fixation. Intraoperatively, cord transection was seen in 3 patients, and dural tear with cerebrospinal fluid leak was seen in 1 patient. The mean follow-up period was 14 months (range, 1-36 months), during which 1 patient died of complications arising from bedsores. All patients remained at American Spinal Injury Association grade A neurologically.
   CONCLUSION: Lateraloptosis is difficult to treat, and the aim of surgery is to stabilize the spine. Rehabilitation remains the most crucial factor, but the scarcity of proper rehabilitation centers results in high mortality and morbidity.

TI Biomechanical Stability Afforded by Unilateral Versus Bilateral Pedicle
   Screw Fixation with and without Interbody Support Using Lateral Lumbar

   CONSTRUCTS; DEVICES
AB OBJECTIVE: To determine the stability of fusion constructs with unilateral pedicle screw (UPS) or bilateral pedicle screw (BPS) fixation with and without an interbody implant using the lateral lumbar interbody (LLIF) approach.
   METHODS: Standard nondestructive flexibility tests were performed on 13 cadaveric lumbar specimens to assess spinal stability of intact specimens and 5 configurations of posterior and interbody instrumentation. Spinal stability was determined as mean range of motion in flexion-extension, lateral bending, and axial rotation. Nonpaired comparisons were made for these 6 conditions: 1) intact; 2) unilateral interbody via the LLIF approach (LLIF construct); 3) unilateral interbody + unilateral pedicle screws (UPS) via the LLIF approach (LLIF + UPS); 4) unilateral interbody + bilateral pedicle screws (BPS) using the LLIF approach (LLIF+ BPS); 5) UPS alone; and 6) BPS alone.
   RESULTS: UPS and BPS, with and without interbody support, significantly reduced range of motion during the majority of directions of loading. BPS alone provided greater stability than UPS alone and LLIF alone in all directions of motion except axial rotation. With interbody support, there was no significant difference in stability between BPS and UPS across all movement directions.
   CONCLUSIONS: These biomechanical results suggest that fixation in the lumbar spine with an interbody support using an LLIF approach with UPS is a promising alternative to BPS. Although BPS provides greater immediate stability compared with UPS, in the presence of a lateral interbody implant, UPS and BPS provide equivalent stability. In addition, LLIF does not appear to contribute significantly to immediate stability when BPS is used.

AB BACKGROUND: The optimal form of treatment for C2 spine fractures is controversial. This investigation analyzed the variations in treatment of C2 fractures over time, by age group, and by geographic location.
   METHODS: The Nationwide Emergency Department Sample database was queried to identify patients 18 years and older who sustained C2 fracture without neurologic injury from 2006 to 2012. Subsequently, patients were further filtered based on the intervention they received: collar, halo, and surgery. Regions of hospital used in analysis were defined as Northeast, Midwest, South, and West. Linear regression models were used to analyze trends for C2 incidence rates and treatment type. Analysis of variance tests were used to determine differences among procedure groups when stratified by regions and age groups.
   RESULTS: Surgical intervention for C2 fracture increased from 36.5% in 2006 to 55.7% in 2012 (r= 0.116, P < 0.001). In contrast, the rate of halo use decreased from 57.8% in 2006 to 37.1% in 2012 (r = -0.139, P < 0.001). Surgery displayed increasing trend across all age groups. A greater proportion of patients in the Northeast were treated by collar compared with all other regions (P < 0.001). In contrast, halo use was significantly lower in the Northeast than the other 3 regions (P < 0.001).
   CONCLUSIONS: This investigation demonstrated that surgical management of C2 fractures is increasing in frequency over time and at all age groups. Furthermore, the treatment of these fractures varies by region-the Northeast had the highest incidence of collar use and lowest rate of halo use.

AB BACKGROUND: Nonrechargeable deep brain stimulation impulse generators (IGs) with low or empty battery status require surgical IG exchange several years after initial implantation. The aim of this study was to investigate complication rates after IG exchange surgery and identify risk factors.
   METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed complications following IG exchange surgery from 2008 to 2015 in our department. Medical records of all patients who underwent IG exchange surgery were systematically reviewed. The shortest follow-up time was 19 months.
   RESULTS: From 2008 to 2015, 438 IGs were exchanged in 319 patients. Overall complication rate was 8.90%. Infection developed in 12 patients (2.74%). Six patients (1.37%) experienced local wound erosions. Hardware malfunctions were present in 11 patients (2.51%), and local hemorrhage was observed in 3 cases (0.68%). Repeated fixation of the IG was required in 2 patients (0.46%). Traction of the connecting cables necessitated surgical revision in 2 patients (0.46%). In 2 cases (0.46%), the IG was placed abdominally or exchanged for a smaller device owing to patient discomfort resulting from the initial positioning. One 80-year-old patient (0.23%) had severely worsening heart failure and died 4 days after IG exchange surgery.
   CONCLUSIONS: IG exchange surgery, although often considered a minor surgery, was associated with a complication rate of approximately 9% in our center. Patients and physicians should understand the complication rates associated with IG exchange surgery because this information might facilitate selection of a rechargeable IG.

AB OBJECTIVE: This retrospective cohort study was performed to investigate clinical efficacy of TBGA compared with pedicle screw fixation (PSF).
   METHODS: A total of 86 eligible patients with single-level simple thoracolumbar compression fracture (TLCF) received TBGA (n = 41) or PSF (n = 45) from January 2013 to July 2015. The patients were evaluated using plain radiography, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging preoperatively. The radiologic examinations were performed at each time point postoperatively. Clinical status was assessed using the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) and visual analog scale (VAS) scores. In addition, anterior vertebral body height (AVBH), kyphosis angle (KA), radiologic adjacent segment pathology (RASP), and complication rates were also compared between the 2 groups. The average follow-up period of patients was 26.1 months.
   RESULTS: Significant clinical improvements in ODI, VAS, AVBH, and KA were achieved in both TBGA and PSF groups after surgery, respectively (P < 0.05). There was no statistical difference in improvements of ODI and VAS between the TBGA and PSF groups (P > 0.05). Similarly, improvements of AVBH and KA showed no statistical difference between the 2 groups (P > 0.05). In addition, the rates of RASP and complications in PSF group were significantly higher than the TBGA group during the follow-up period (P < 0.05).
   CONCLUSIONS: TBGA can achieve satisfactory clinical effects in treatment of simple TLCF. TBGA involves shorter operative time, less blood loss, lower RASP, and lower complication rates and could be more suitable for the surgical treatment of simple TLCF.

AB OBJECTIVE: To determine heterogeneity of high-grade glioma (HGG) and its surrounding area and explore quantitative analysis of invasion of HGG using diffusion tensor imaging.
   METHODS: This study included 14 patients with HGG and preoperative magnetic resonance imaging and diffusion tensor imaging examinations. Three regions of interest were placed. Apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and fractional anisotropy (FA) values of these regions of interest were measured, and specimens from the 3 regions of interest were obtained under navigation guidance. Postoperative examinations of specimens were carried out. Correlations between ADC and FA values and tumor cell density were evaluated.
   RESULTS: Median survival was 36.7 months. As distance from the tumor increased, the number of tumor cells significantly decreased. Regarding levels of matrix metalloproteinase-9 and Ki-67, only the differences between tumor and distances of 1 cm and 2 cm away from the tumor were statistically significant. For analysis of the relationship between tumor cell density and ADC and FA values, the discriminant formulas were as follows: G1 = -13.678 + 14984.791 (X) + 14443.847 (Y) (tumor cell density >= 10%); G2 = - 11.649 + 14443.847 (X) + 33.285 (Y) (tumor cell density <10%).
   CONCLUSIONS: We verified the heterogeneity of HGG and its surrounding area and found that patients with extensive resection may have longer survival. We also found a few formulas using FA and ADC values to predict tumor cell density.

AB BACKGROUND: The treatment of Tarlov cysts is challenging and difficult. The objective of our study was to describe the security and efficacy of the subcutaneous infusion port for drainage of symptomatic Tarlov cysts.
   METHODS: The authors executed a retrospective review of data from 5 symptomatic Tarlov cysts patients who were treated using a subcutaneous infusion port from June 2014 to July 2017 Numerical Rating Scale scores and the Japanese Orthopedic Association scores of back pain were analyzed. Complications and adverse effects on post-operative days 1, 7, 14, and 28 were also analyzed. The mean follow-up was 12.6 months.
   RESULTS: Five adults (3 females and 2 males) who had been symptomatic received a subcutaneous infusion port. After treatment, all patients experienced pain relief and pain alleviation lasted from 1 day to 3 years without complications and adverse effects.
   CONCLUSIONS: A subcutaneous infusion port is a useful treatment option for symptomatic Tarlov cysts. When the patients' symptoms returned and the cysts repressurized, we quickly and simply drained the cysts by using the infusion port.

   epidemiology
ID ADHESIN; MICROBLEEDS; HEMORRHAGE; EXPRESSION; STRAINS; COHORT
AB BACKGROUND: Among human oral bacteria, particular kinds of Streptococcus mutans (SO known as dental caries pathogens contain a collagen-binding protein, Cnm, and show platelet aggregation inhibition and matrix metalloproteinase-9 activation. We have previously reported that these strains may be a risk factor for intracerebral hemorrhage. As a major sample-providing hospital, we report the clinical details, including intracranial aneurysms and ischemic stroke.
   METHODS: After the study received approval from the Ethical Committee, 429 samples of whole saliva were obtained from patients who were admitted to or visited our hospital between February 16, 2010, and February 28, 2011. The study cohort comprised 48 patients with cardioembolic stroke (CES), 151 with non-CES infarct, 54 with intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), 43 with ruptured intracranial aneurysm (RIA), and 97 with unruptured intracranial aneurysm (UIA). Cultured SM was identified as Cnm-positive when the corresponding gene was positive. The results were compared with those from 79 healthy volunteers. Relationships between Cnm-positive SM and known risk factors, including hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, smoking, and alcohol consumption, were analyzed.
   RESULTS: A statistically significant high Cnm-positive rate was observed in patients with CES, non-CES infarct, ICH, and RIA (P = 0.002, 0.039, 0.013, and 0.009, respectively). There were no relationships between Cnm-positive SM and known risk factors.
   CONCLUSIONS: Specific types of oral SM can be a risk factor for cardioembolic infarct, intracerebral hemorrhage, and intracranial aneurysm rupture. Further study is needed.

AB OBJECTIVE: To explore whether the iliac wing influences L5 pedicle screw (PS) fixation and to propose methods to reduce such influence.
   METHODS: A total of 100 computed tomography scans (from 50 male and 50 female patients) of the lower lumbar region and pelvis were obtained and 3-dimensionally reconstructed. Cylinders with 6.5-mm diameters were drawn to simulate the different trajectories of L5 PS. The maximum lengths and lateral angles of trajectories, and the vertical distances from the inner edge of the iliac wing to these trajectories, were measured.
   RESULTS: The maximum lengths and lateral angles differed significantly among trajectories; the maximum length, but not the lateral angle, differed significantly between male and female subjects. The influence of the iliac wing was more significant in male than in female subjects. The iliac wing had a greater effect on screws implanted along the pedicle axis than on screws for which the trajectories commenced at Du's entry point and passed through the center of the pedicle.
   CONCLUSIONS: This study elucidates the influence of the iliac wing on L5 PS fixation. Careful attention is required when implanting PSs, especially in male patients. The combined use of Du's technique and a percutaneous method for PS implantation effectively reduces the influence of the iliac wing. To minimize the complications of PS fixation further, preoperative simulation of fixation for each patient is very important.

AB BACKGROUND: Percutaneous transforaminal endoscopic discectomy (PTED) is a minimally invasive surgical technique used principally for the treatment of lumbar disc herniation (LDH). LDH is a frequent spinal ailment in obese individuals. The aim of this prospectively designed study was to assess for the first time in the literature the impact of PTED in postoperative parameters of health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in obese patients with LDH within a 2-year follow-up period, to further evaluate the effectiveness of PTED.
   METHODS: Patients with surgically treatable LDH were divided into 2 groups. Group A constituted 20 obese patients, and group B was composed of 10 patients with normal body mass index (BMI). A visual analog scale was used for pain evaluation, and the Short Form SF-36 Medical Survey Questionnaire contributed to HRQoL assessment. Follow-up was conducted preoperatively and at 6 weeks and 3, 6, 12, and 24 months postoperatively.
   RESULTS: Two of the 20 patients (10%) presented with severe postoperative pain, necessitating conventional microdiscectomy. All studied parameters exhibited maximal improvement at 6 months in group A and at 6 weeks in group B, with subsequent stabilization. Obese patients scored lower in all parameters compared with their healthy counterparts with normal BMI, acquiring a less favorable clinical benefit.
   CONCLUSIONS: PTED appears to be a generally safe and effective method for treating obese patients with LDH. However, major technical challenges that lead to a higher frequency of complications, as well as the lesser acquired clinical benefit, in obese patients may contribute to the further consideration for PTED in specific obese patients, especially on the grounds of low surgical experience.

AB BACKGROUND: Patients are increasingly turning to online resources to inquire about individual physicians and to gather health information. However, little research exists studying the online presence of neurosurgeons across the country. This study aimed to characterize these online profiles and assess the scope of neurosurgeons' digital identities.
   METHODS: Medicare-participating neurologic surgeons from the United States and Puerto Rico were identified using the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) Physician Comparable Downloadable File. Each physician was characterized by his or her medical education, graduation year, city of practice, gender, and affiliation with an academic institution. Using a Google-based custom search tool, the top 10 search results for each physician were extracted and categorized as 1 of the following: 1) physician, hospital, or healthcare system controlled, 2) third-party or government controlled, 3) social media-based, 4) primary journal article, or 5) other.
   RESULTS: Among the physicians within the CMS database, 4751 self-identified as being neurosurgeons, yielding a total of 45,875 uniform resource locator search results pertinent to these physicians. Of the 4751 neurosurgeons, 2317 (48.8%) and 2434 (51.2%) were classified as academic and nonacademic neurosurgeons, respectively. At least 1 search result was obtained for every physician. Hospital, healthcare system, or physician-controlled websites (18,206; 39.7%) and third-party websites (17,122; 37.3%) were the 2 most commonly observed domain types. Websites belonging to social media platforms accounted for 4843 (10.6%) search results, and websites belonging to peer-reviewed academic journals accounted for 1888 (4.1%) search results. The frequency with which a third-party domain appeared as the first search result was higher for nonacademic neurosurgeons than for academic neurosurgeons.
   CONCLUSIONS: In general, neurosurgeons lacked a controllable online presence within their first page of Google Search results. Third-party physician rating websites constituted about half of the search results, and a relative lack of social media websites was apparent. Still, numerous opportunities exist for neurosurgeons to address this disparity.

AB BACKGROUND: In superficial temporal artery-middle cerebral artery (STA-MCA) anastomosis, there is a certain risk of intraoperative acute occlusion of the bypass that can cause operative complications.
   OBJECTIVE: We sought to assess the efficacy of resuturing at the same site after intraoperative acute occlusion of the bypass.
   METHODS: In total, 129 STA-MCA anastomosis operations were performed on 125 patients at our institution. The electronic medical records of each patient were reviewed to gather information regarding intraoperative occlusion events, and the operative videos and postoperative radiologic images were also reviewed.
   RESULTS: Twelve intraoperative acute occlusions were identified. In each case, resuturing was performed after cutting all knots, flushing the thrombus, and trimming the edges of the STAs. In 11 cases, indocyanine green video-angiography and/or Doppler sonography revealed patency during the operation, which was confirmed by postoperative magnetic resonance angiography. None of the 12 cases exhibited high-signal intensities in the MCA area on diffusion-weighted images.
   CONCLUSION: If intraoperative acute occlusion of STA-MCA anastomosis occurs, reanastomosis at the site should be the first option.

AB OBJECTIVE: Optimal placement of electrodes is important for spinal cord stimulation. Factors affecting the difficulty of percutaneous electrode placement are not well known. In this study, we retrospectively evaluated the factors affecting the difficulty of percutaneous electrode placement.
   METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of 90 consecutive procedures of percutaneous cylindrical electrode implantation at the first author's institution. Age, sex, smoking state, body mass index, the duration of time from the beginning of pain syndrome to operation, diagnosis, the number of previous electrode placements, the previous electrode implantation period, the presence of axial low back pain, the electrode tip level, the pattern of electrode placement, and the reason for reimplantation were selected as factors associated with the success of electrode placement or the operation time of electrode placement.
   RESULTS: The number of previous electrode placements and the electrode tip level were independently associated with the operation time of electrode placement. According to both univariable and multivariable regression analyses, 1 previous electrode placement lengthened the operation time by approximately 15 minutes. No factors were significantly associated with the success of electrode placement. The more frequently that previous electrode placement was performed, the more difficult electrode placement tended to be. However, electrode reimplantation can be successful given extra time.
   CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to evaluate factors affecting the difficulty of percutaneous electrode placement. A history of percutaneous cylindrical electrode placement did not affect the success of current placement, although it lengthened the operation time.

AB OBJECTIVE: Abducens nerve palsy (ANP) after transvenous embolization (TVE) for cavernous sinus (CS) dural arteriovenous fistulas (DAVFs) sometimes persists. The aim of this study was to assess the correlation between the coil mass and the long-term outcome of ANP after TVE.
   METHODS: Between January 2008 and July 2016, 33 patients with a CS DAVF underwent WE at our institute. On the basis of the relationship to the internal carotid artery (ICA), we divided the lateral part of the CS into the following 3 portions: anterolateral, anterolateral to the anterior bend of the ICA; middle-lateral (ML), lateral to the horizontal segment of the ICA; and posterolateral, posterolateral to the posterior bend of the ICA.
   RESULTS: ANP persisted in 4 patients. The number of coils (35.3 vs. 21.9 coils; P = 0.04), coil volume (198.4 vs. 103.6 mm(3) ; P = 0.03), and coil volume in the ML (54.9 vs. 20.3 mm(3) ; P = 0.01) were significantly greater in the ANP group than in the non-ANP group. In the logistic regression analysis, only the ML coil volume was significantly associated with the persistence of ANP (P = 0.04). Based on the receiver operating characteristic curve, the optimal cutoff value of the ML coil volume was 27.9 mm(3) (sensitivity, 100%; specificity, 72.4%).
   CONCLUSIONS: Overpacking in the ML of the CS should be avoided to prevent persistent ANP. The cutoff value of the ML coil volume may provide a good guide for the practical use of TVE for CS DAVFs.

AB BACKGROUND: Traumatic spinal injury (TSI) results from injury to bony, ligamentous, and/or neurologic structures of the spinal column and can cause significant morbidity and mortality. The global burden of TSI is poorly understood, so we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to estimate the global volume of TSI.
   METHODS: We performed a systematic review through PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Databases on TSI studies reported from 2000 to 2016. Collected data were used to perform a meta-analysis to estimate the annual incidence of TSI across World Health Organization regions and World Bank income groups using random-effect models. Incorporating global population figures, the annual worldwide volume of TSI was estimated.
   RESULTS: A total of 102 studies were included in the systematic review and 19 studies in the meta-analysis. The overall global incidence of TSI was 10.5 cases per 100,000 persons, resulting in an estimated 768,473 [95% confidence interval, 597,213-939,732] new cases of TSI annually worldwide. The incidence of TSI was higher in low- and middle-income countries (8.72 per 100,000 persons) compared with high-income countries (13.69 per 100,000 persons). Road traffic accidents, followed by falls, were the most common mechanism of TSI worldwide. Overall, 48.8% of patients with TSI required surgery.
   CONCLUSIONS: TSI is a major source of morbidity and mortality throughout the world. Largely preventable mechanisms, including road traffic accidents and falls, are the main causes of TSI globally. Further investigation is needed to delineate local and regional TSI incidences and causes, especially in low- and middle-income countries.

AB OBJECTIVE: To determine if end-stage liver disease (ESLD) in patients with intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) is associated with increased mortality.
   METHODS: This single-center, retrospective cohort study included 53 patients (33 in ESLD cohort and 20 in non-ESLD cohort) who received neurosurgical care between 2006 and 2017- ESLD was defined clinically as severely impaired liver function and at least 1 major complication of liver failure. The primary outcome was mortality.
   RESULTS: Overall, in-hospital, and 30-day mortality rates were higher in the ESLD cohort versus the non-ESLD cohort (79 vs. 30%, 79 vs. 20%, and 64 vs. 25%, all P S 0.01). We identified a significant difference in overall survival between ESLD and non-ESLD cohorts on Kaplan-Meier analysis (P = 0.004 with log-rank and Wilcoxon tests). Odds of overall, in-hospital, and 30-day mortality in the ESLD cohort were 8.67 (95% confidence interval [CI], 2.44-30.84), 14.86 (95% CI, 3.75-58.90), and 5.25 (95% CI, 1.53-18.08). Other predictors of overall mortality included primary admission diagnosis of liver disease (odds ratio [OR] = 9.60; 95% CI, 3.75-58.90), higher Child-Pugh (OR = 1.64; 95% CI, 2.66-34.67) and Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (OR = 1.12; 95% CI, 1.04-120) scores, lower Glasgow Coma Scale score (OR = 0.73; 95% CI, 0.61-0.88), ICH that developed in the hospital (OR = 4.11; 95% CI, 1.21-13.98), and intraparenchymal hemorrhage (OR = 9.23, 95% CI, 1.72-49.56).
   CONCLUSIONS: ESLD in patients with ICH is associated with increased mortality.

AB OBJECTIVE: To evaluate clinical feasibility and safety of percutaneous endoscopic decompression by a uniportal, unilateral approach for lumbar canal or lateral recess stenosis.
   METHODS: In this retrospective study, the procedure was performed with endoscopic instruments in the same way as conventional microscopic laminotomy and flavectomy. Clinical outcomes (visual analog scale, Oswestry Disability Index, modified MacNab criteria) were evaluated. Surgical outcomes, including operative time, hospital stay, and complications, were recorded.
   RESULTS: Decompression was performed in 213 patients (232 lumbar levels) for spinal canal or lateral recess stenosis (unilateral laminotomy, n = 80; bilateral laminotomy, n = 152). Mean follow-up period was 26.45 months. Mean visual analog scale for leg pain, and back pain and mean Oswestry Disability Index improved from 8.24%, 5.35%, and 67.8% at baseline to 1.93% (P < 0.001), 2.05% (P < 0.001), and 17.14% (P < 0.001) at final follow-up. Based on modified MacNab criteria, excellent or good results were obtained in 93.8% of patients. Average operative time was 105.3 +/- 56 minutes. In the late period of the learning curve, mean operative time was shortened by two thirds, and mean hospital stay was 2.45 days. There were 12 cases of transient postoperative dysesthesia, 3 cases of motor weakness, and 6 cases of dural tear. No patient had postoperative infection, hematoma, or need for revision surgery for incomplete decompression.
   CONCLUSIONS: Percutaneous endoscopic decompression by a uniportal, unilateral approach is a safe, clinically feasible, and effective surgical technique for treatment of lumbar stenosis.

AB BACKGROUND: Resident applicants in neurosurgery often wonder what factors impact their chances of successfully matching. Using data published by the National Residency Match Program for 2009-2016, we examined which components of the Electronic Residency Application Service application correlated with successful residency matching.
   METHODS: Data were collected from the National Residency Match Program publication Charting Outcomes in the Match from all years it was available for neurosurgery (2009, 2011, 2014, 2016). Individual factors reported (number of contiguous ranks, research projects, publications and presentations, work experiences, volunteer experiences, United States Medical Licensing Examination Step 1 and 2 score deciles, categorical data about Alpha Omega Alpha status, Ph.D. degree, other degree, and strength of medical school National Institutes of Health funding) were aggregated for all 3 years. Categorical data were available only for U.S. seniors. Spearman correlation and chi(2)were used for ranked data and categorical data, respectively. Separate analyses were run for U.S. seniors and independent applicants.
   RESULTS: For U.S. seniors applying to neurosurgery, number of contiguous ranks, United States Medical Licensing Examination Step 1 and 2 scores, research projects, Alpha Omega Alpha status, and medical school top 40 National Institutes of Health funding were significantly associated with successful matching of applicants. Number of volunteer experiences was nearly statistically significant. For independent applicants, only United States Medical Licensing Examination Step 1 and 2 scores and number of research projects were statistically significant.
   CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to analyze National Residency Match Program data for predictors of success in neurosurgical matching. Students applying to neurosurgery residency and their mentors should be aware of which baseline objective factors are associated with match success.

AB BACKGROUND: There is an abundance of works published on severe traumatic brain injury (sTBI). Bibliometric analyses aim to provide a macroscopic view of research activities regarding sTBI and are helpful in determining the most impactful studies within this field.
   METHODS: We performed a generalized search using the database of Web of Science, organized the references by the number of citations, and reviewed full length-articles for the top-100 most-cited articles on sTBI. The articles were classified according to focus.
   RESULTS: The top-100 articles were cited on average 326.4 times per paper. The Journal of Neurosurgery published the greatest number of top-100 cited articles (9 of 100). Authors from the United States published the majority (67%) of the most-cited articles. The most popular categories were "reviews and guidelines" and "etiology and epidemiology."
   CONCLUSIONS: The present study provides a cross-sectional summary of the 100 most-cited articles on sTBI, highlighting areas of research needing further investigation and development.

   PATHOGENESIS; DIAGNOSIS; DISEASE; TUMORS
AB OBJECTIVE: Pituitary abscess (PA) is a rare but serious intrasellar disorder with potentially high disability and mortality. Secondary PA after transsphenoidal surgery (TS) is extremely rare, and only a few case reports have been identified in the literature. This study explored the salient clinical manifestations and etiologies to determine appropriate treatment.
   METHODS: A retrospective review of 6832 consecutive patients who had undergone TS for pituitary diseases in Peking Union Medical College Hospital between 2003 and 2017 was performed. Demographics, previous medical and surgical history, clinical presentation, imaging features, and treatment details of 23 patients who had been diagnosed with secondary PA after TS among the cohort were reviewed.
   RESULTS: Among these patients, the original pituitary lesion before TS included Rathke's cleft cyst (8 patients, 34.8%), nonfunctioning pituitary adenoma (11 patients, 47.8%), and somatotropic adenoma (4 patients, 17.4%). The diameter of the original pituitary lesion ranged from 11 to 47 nun. About 52% of secondary PAs occurred within a half a year after surgery. Based on the history of TS, clinical presentation, biochemical testing, and typical imaging features, the preoperative diagnosis rate was as high as 78%.
   CONCLUSIONS: Although rare, secondary PA should be included in the differential diagnosis of intrasellar lesions after TS. Patients with an initial diagnosis of Rathke's cleft cyst or pituitary macroadenoma were more likely to have PA after TS. Adequate surgical drainage combined with microbiology-guided antibiotic therapy is the first choice for treatment.

   APPROACH; MIDDLE FOSSA; COMPLICATIONS; LESIONS; EXPERIENCE
AB BACKGROUND: The retrosigmoid approach is broadly applicable to many posterior fossa procedures. However, cerebellar retraction is often necessary for lesions in the cerebellopontine angle, which can lead to complications. An extended retrosigmoid approach skeletonizes the sigmoid sinus and allows a wider corridor with less retraction. This study investigated the differences in retraction pressure between the retrosigmoid and extended retrosigmoid approach in a cadaveric model.
   METHODS: Anatomic dissection of 2 cadaveric heads was performed for comparison of surgical approaches. Bilateral measurements were obtained on each head, providing 4 sets of data. Retrosigmoid craniotomy was first performed with recording of retraction pressure necessary for 1.5-cm exposure. The exposure was then expanded to an extended retrosigmoid approach, and retraction pressures were recorded.
   RESULTS: Mean retraction pressure in cadaver 1 for retrosigmoid and extended retrosigmoid approaches was 20.25 + 5.9 mm Hg and 10.25 + 3.8 mm Hg, respectively; in cadaver 2, values were 11.75 +/- 3.1 mm Hg and 4.75 +/- 1.8 mm Hg, respectively. This corresponded to a mean relative reduction in retraction pressure of 49.4% in cadaver 1 and 59.6% in cadaver 2 by using the extended retrosigmoid approach. Retraction pressures were also significantly less (P < 0.05) for the extended retrosigmoid group when comparing all surgical approaches (N = 4).
   CONCLUSIONS: The extended retrosigmoid approach gains better visualization with reduced brain retraction. In our study, cerebellar retraction pressures were greatly reduced when using the extended retrosigmoid approach in a cadaveric model.

AB OBJECTIVE: To investigate the value of 3-dimensional (3D)-printed models with pathologic entities in enhancing the learning curve of surgery of tuberculum sellae meningioma.
   METHODS: We printed 4 models of tuberculum sellae meningiomas based on radiologic data using a 3D printer. Participants were allocated to the 3D group and the atlas group. In the 3D group, participants learned surgery with the assistance of 3D models. In the atlas group, participants used only 2-dimensional materials to assist their learning. All participants undertook a pre-test and post-test. The scores were used to identify the difference in learning efficiency between the 2 groups.
   RESULTS: A total of 42 new trainees were recruited, of whom 22 were in the 3D group and 20 in the atlas group. The baseline data were not significantly different. The difference of pre-test score was not significant, either. However, the post-test score was significantly greater in the 3D group (P = 0.005), and the change in score was also significantly greater in the 3D group (P < 0.001). In accordance with the objective test, the subjective survey through a questionnaire from participants in the 3D group showed that 3D models significantly promoted the learning curve of this kind of complex skull base surgery.
   CONCLUSIONS: 3D-printed models can assist in improving the learning curve of surgery of tuberculum sellae meningiomas. It particularly aids in memorization and spatial construction, improves understanding of surgical view, and arouses interest on the part of the trainee. We recommend using it in the education of complex skull base surgery.

AB OBJECTIVES: To Understand the development of sporadic cerebral cavernous malformations (SCCM) comprehensively, we analyzed gene expression profiles in SCCMs by gene microarray.
   METHODS: The total number of the specimens collected in our study was 14, 7 of which were SCCMs, and the others were controls that were obtained from normal brain vessels. The total RNA was extracted and hybridized with oligonucleotide array containing 21522 genes. The analysis of Gene Ontology (GO) items and molecular pathways was performed based on the GO and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes databases. The gene coexpression networks were constructed to identify the core genes regulating the progression of SCCMs.
   RESULTS: A total of 785 probes, showing differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between the 2 groups, were found by the gene chips. According to the analysis based on GO and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes, 286 GO terms and 53 pathways were identified to be significantly relevant with the DEGs. All differential gene interactions were analyzed and the core genes were selected in the coexpression networks.
   CONCLUSIONS: The gene expression profiles obtained from SCCMs were significantly distinct from those of control brain vascular specimens. These DEGs are related to multiple molecular signal pathways, such as the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway, cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, focal adhesion, and inflammatory response. According to the analysis of the core genes selected in the gene coexpression networks, we postulated that CSF1R, XCL1, KCNMB1, RHOG, and TJP1 might exert enormous functions in the pathogenesis of SCCMs. However, further studies are required to aid in the clinical diagnosis and prevention of SCCMs.

AB OBJECTIVE: Matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), pituitary tumor transforming gene (PUG), and high mobility group A 2 (HMGA2) play important roles in the tumorigenesis of adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH)-secreting pituitary tumors, but their associations with tumor recurrence after transsphenoidal adenomectomy remain unclear. The aim of the study was to investigate the immunohistochemical expression profiles of MMP-9, PTTG, HMGA2, and Ki-67 in recurrent and nonrecurrent ACTH-secreting pituitary tumors and to identify their associations with tumor behavior and recurrence status.
   METHODS: A retrospective study was performed including 55 patients with sporadic Cushing's disease with long-term remission after transsphenoidal adenomectomy. Fifty-five ACTH-secreting pituitary tumor specimens and 2 normal pituitary glands were collected. After an intensive follow-up (33-59 months, mean 41.8 months), patients were divided into 2 groups based on their recurrence status: the nonrecurrent group (n = 28) and the recurrent group (n = 27). The expression of MMP-9, PTTG, HMGA2, and Ki-67 in each sample was examined and quantified by immunohistochemistry. The association between MMP-9, PTTG, HMGA2, and Ki-67 expression and clinicopathologic characteristics and tumor recurrence were evaluated.
   RESULTS: There was a significantly increased expression of MMP-9 in the recurrent group compared with the nonrecurrent group (P = 0.022), and this was strongly associated with the recurrence-free interval (P = 0.007, correlation coefficient. = -0.354). PTTG, HMGA2, and Ki-67 expression were not significantly different between the recurrent group and the nonrecurrent group. No expression of MMP-9, PTTG, HMGA2, or Ki-67 was detected in the 2normal pituitary glands.
   CONCLUSIONS: ACTH-secreting pituitary tumors with greater levels of MMP-9 were associated with a greater recurrence rate and a shorter recurrence-free interval. MMP-9 could be a valuable tool for predicting recurrence of ACTH-secreting pituitary tumors.

AB OBJECTIVE: Oxidative stress has been associated with secondary brain injury after spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (SIH). Malondialdehyde (MDA) appears in blood during lipid oxidation. Higher serum MDA levels have been found in patients with SIH than in healthy controls; however, we have not found data indicating an association between elevated serum MDA and early mortality in this population. This was the main objective of our study.
   METHODS: MDA levels were measured in serum samples obtained from 100 patients at diagnosis of severe SIH (Glasgow Coma Scale score <= 8) and 80 healthy controls. The endpoint of the study was mortality at 30 days.
   RESULTS: Serum MDA levels were significantly higher in patients with severe SIH than in healthy controls (1.46 [1.18-2.2] vs. 1.11 [0.72-1.51]; P < 0.001), and in non-surviving (n = 46) than in surviving (n = 54) patients (1.68 [1.23-4.02] vs. 1.37 [0.99-1.92]; P = 0.002). The area under the receiving operating characteristic curve of serum MDA levels to predict 30-day mortality was 0.68 (95% CI, 0.58-0.77; P < 0.001). Serum MDA levels were associated with 30-day mortality (OR, 6.279; 95% CI, 1.940-20.319; P = 0.002).
   CONCLUSIONS: The most important new finding of our study is that there is an association between serum MDA levels at diagnosis of severe SIH and early mortality.

DT Article
DE Cervical; Corpectomy; Ligament; Spondylosis; Surgery
ID SPINAL-CORD; C5 PALSY; DECOMPRESSION; MYELOPATHY
AB BACKGROUND: Removing the posterior longitudinal ligament in cervical corpectomy is a controversial issue. It is unclear whether the risks are counterbalanced by clinical benefits. Another unexplored topic is whether the width of the corpectomy affects outcome.
   METHODS: This cross-sectional retrospective study included consecutive patients who underwent cervical corpectomy for spondylosis by 6 different neurosurgeons. We compared 2 groups, where the posterior longitudinal ligament was either removed (N = 15 patients) or preserved (N = 21 patients). The posterior width of the corpectomy was assessed postoperatively with computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging. Clinical results were evaluated with the visual analog scale (VAS), Modified Japanese Orthopedic Association scale (MJOAS), Cooper scale, and neck disability index (NDI), in the long-term follow-up.
   RESULTS: Compared to preservation, removal of the posterior longitudinal ligament produced more favorable clinical results (but not statistically significant), based on the VAS (+41%, P = 0.48), MJOAS (+26.5%, P = 0.62), Cooper scale (+19%, P = 0.75), and NDI (+62%, P = 0.22). Magnetic resonance imagings showed that removing the posterior longitudinal ligament produced greater evagination of the dural sac into the space left by the corpectomy. Improvements in clinical outcome were associated with more posterior bone wall removal in the corpectomy (corpectomy width >= 15.6 mm; P < 0.05), based on the VAS, NDI, and MJOAS.
   CONCLUSIONS: Removing the posterior longitudinal ligament in cervical corpectomy may produce a better outcome, particularly when associated with more posterior bone wall removal in the corpectomy.

AB OBJECTIVE: An onsite access to neurointerventional radiology (NIR) may be useful for managing patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH) after the aneurysm-securing procedure. We aimed to assess the association between neurological outcomes related to aSAH and onsite access to MR service.
   METHODS: This was a sequential period study of 47 patients with aSAH admitted consecutively during the pre-NIR period (January 2010 to June 2012) compared with 81 patients with aSAH admitted consecutively during the post-NIR period (January 2013 to June 2015) at an academic tertiary referral intensive care unit (ICU). The primary end point was the incidence of poor neurological outcome, defined as modified Rankin scale of >= 3 at 6 months from ictus. Secondary outcomes included incidence of symptomatic vasospasm (SV) and length of stay in ICU/hospital.
   RESULTS: The primary end point was observed in 18 of 47 (38%) patients during the pre-NIR period versus 25 of 81 (31%) patients during the post-NIR period (P = 0.39). The post-NIR period did not have an independent impact on neurological outcomes (adjusted odds ratio = 0.8, 95% confidence interval 0.3-2.1; P = 0.66). Of the patients who developed SV, 10 of 47 (21%) were during the pre-NIR period versus 33 of 81 (41%) during the post-NIR period (P = 0.02). The post-NIR period and higher Fisher grade were independent predictors of SV. Patients with SV had similar outcomes, but with longer stay in ICU during the post-NIR period compared with the pre-NIR period.
   CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with aSAH, the post-NIR period was associated with more frequent detection of SV, more endovascular procedures, longer hospital stay, but with no appreciable improvement in neurological outcomes either overall or in the subset of patients with SV.

AB OBJECTIVE: Although revascularization surgery for patients with moyamoya disease can effectively prevent ischemic events and thus improve the long-term clinical outcome, the incidence of postoperative ischemic complications affects patients' quality of life. This study aimed to clarify the risk factors associated with postoperative ischemic complications and to discuss the appropriate perioperative management.
   METHODS: Fifty-eight revascularization operations were performed in 37 children with moyamoya disease. Patients with moyamoya syndrome were excluded from this study. Magnetic resonance imaging was performed within 7 days after surgery. Postoperative cerebral infarction was defined as a diffusion-weighted imaging high-intensity lesion with or without symptoms. We usually use fentanyl and dexmedetomidine as postoperative analgesic and sedative drugs for patients with moyamoya disease. We used barbiturate coma therapy for pediatric patients with moyamoya disease who have all postoperative cerebral infarction risk factors.
   RESULTS: Postoperative ischemic complications were observed in 10.3% of the children with moyamoya disease (6 of 58). Preoperative cerebral infarctions (P = 0.0005), younger age (P = 0.038), higher Suzuki grade (P = 0.003), and posterior cerebral artery stenosis/occlusion (P = 0.003) were related to postoperative ischemic complications. Postoperative cerebral infarction occurred all pediatric patients using barbiturate coma therapy.
   CONCLUSIONS: The risk factors associated with postoperative ischemic complications for children with moyamoya disease are preoperative infarction, younger age, higher Suzuki grade, and posterior cerebral artery stenosis/occlusion. Barbiturate coma therapy for pediatric patients with moyamoya disease who have the previous risk factors is insufficient for prevention of postoperative cerebral infarction. More studies are needed to identify the appropriate perioperative management.

AB BACKGROUND: Previous studies have implicated traumatic brain injury (TBI) as a risk factor for Parkinson disease (PD). However, the incidence risk of new-onset TBI among patients with PD is not well established. This study investigated the contribution of PD to new-onset TBI associations.
   METHODS: The study selected 6076 patients with PD and using 1:2 propensity score matching 12,152 general population cohorts in a longitudinal population database in Taiwan. The Cox proportional hazard regression model was used to estimate the hazard ratio of TBI adjusted with the potential confounding factors.
   RESULTS: The incidence of TBI in patients with PD (2.57%) and compared cohorts (1.81%) was significantly different (P = 0.0007). Patients with PD had a higher risk of TBI (hazard ratio, 1.63; 95% confidence interval, 1.32-2.01) compared with the general population. Patients with PD with TBI incidence had a higher Charlson Comorbidity Index than did the general population with TBI (P < 0.0001). Fall is the major cause of TBI in patients with PD.
   CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that patients with PD have a high risk of TBI, and the major cause of TBI in patients with PD is fall.

AB BACKGROUND: Integration of three-dimensional (3D) printing and stereolithography into clinical practice is in its nascence, and concepts may be esoteric to the practicing neurosurgeon. Currently, creation of 3D printed implants involves recruitment of offsite third parties. We explored a range of 3D scanning and stereolithographic techniques to create patient-specific synthetic implants using an onsite, clinician-facilitated approach.
   METHODS: We simulated bilateral craniectomies in a single cadaveric specimen. We devised 3 methods of creating stereolithographically viable virtual models from removed bone. First, we used preoperative and postoperative computed tomography scanner-derived bony window models from which the flap was extracted. Second, we used an entry-level 3D light scanner to scan and render models of the individual bone pieces. Third, we used an arm-mounted, 3D laser scanner to create virtual models using a real-time approach.
   RESULTS: Flaps were printed from the computed tomography scanner and laser scanner models only in a ultraviolet-cured polymer. The light scanner did not produce suitable virtual models for printing. The computed tomography scanner-derived models required extensive postfabrication modification to fit the existing defects. The laser scanner models assumed good fit within the defects without any modification.
   CONCLUSIONS: The methods presented varying levels of complexity in acquisition and model rendering. Each technique required hardware at varying in price points from $0 to approximately $100,000. The laser scanner models produced the best quality parts, which had near-perfect fit with the original defects. Potential neurosurgical applications of this technology are discussed.

AB BACKGROUND: The limbic tracts are involved in crucial cerebral functions such as memory, emotion, and behavior. The complex architecture of the limbic circuit makes it harder to approach compared with other white matter networks. Our study aims to describe the 3-dimensional anatomy of the limbic white matter by the use of 2 complementary study methods, namely ex vivo fiber dissection and in vivo magnetic resonance imaging-based tractography.
   METHODS: Three fiber dissection protocols were performed using blunt wooden instruments and a surgical microscope on formalin-fixed brains prepared according to the Klingler method. Diffusion tensor imaging acquisitions were done with a 3-Tesla magnetic resonance scanner on patients with head and neck pathology that did not involve the brain. Fiber tracking was performed with manually selected regions of interest.
   RESULTS: Cingulum, fornix, the anterior thalamic peduncle, the accumbofrontal bundle, medial forebrain bundle, the uncinate fasciculus, the mammillothalamic tract, ansa peduncularis, and stria terminalis were dissected and fiber tracked. For each tract, location, configuration, segmentation, dimensions, dissection and tractography particularities, anatomical relations, and terminations are described. The limbic white matter tracts were systematized as 2 concentric rings around the thalamus. The inner ring is formed by fornix, mammillothalamic tract, ansa peduncularis, stria terminalis, accumbofrontal fasciculus, and medial forebrain bundle and anterior thalamic peduncle, and the outer ring is formed by the cingulum and uncinate fasciculus.
   CONCLUSIONS: This paper proposes a fiber-tracking protocol for the limbic tracts inspired and validated by fiber dissection findings that can be used routinely in the clinical practice.

DE Management; Meningioma; Obstetric; Pregnancy; Skull base; Tumor
ID INTRACRANIAL NEOPLASMS; NONOBSTETRIC SURGERY; PREGNANCY; MENINGIOMAS;
   RECEPTORS; STRATEGY
AB BACKGROUND: Neoplasms rarely present during pregnancy; however, increases in plasma volume, hormone release-induced growth, and tumor hypervascularity can cause rapidly progressive symptoms of varying severity, ranging from those not requiring intervention to those necessitating emergent operations. Here we describe an algorithm for the management of symptomatic neoplasms in the obstetric population and provide recommendations for surgical indications and timing.
   METHODS: Patients who presented to the skull base clinic at a large tertiary care hospital between 2010 and 2016 were reviewed to identify those who presented with a skull base tumor during pregnancy.
   RESULTS: Our study cohort comprised 9 women with a skull base tumor during pregnancy. Four patients presented with symptoms that necessitated emergent skull base surgery, and 5 underwent surgery after delivery or were followed with continued surveillance. All operated patients had a World Health Organization grade I or II meningioma or schwannoma. There were no maternal complications. Based on our experience with this cohort, we have created a management algorithm.
   CONCLUSIONS: Management of a symptomatic tumor during pregnancy requires balancing the potential for curing the mother and the risk of harming the fetus. Trimester of pregnancy is the most critical factor in evaluating the need for urgent management. The second trimester is the optimal time for surgery, associated with the lowest risk for spontaneous abortion or preterm birth. The first and third trimesters are associated with increased risk of miscarriage and preterm labor, respectively. Induction of labor for preterm delivery, followed by surgery, may be appropriate in the early third trimester. Regardless of the perceived risk, however, all pregnant women with an emergent presentation should be offered surgery, regardless of trimester.

AB OBJECTIVE: To present diagnosis and surgical management of postlaminectomy spondylolisthesis in patients without preoperative instability and a review of relevant literature.
   METHODS: Medical records and radiographic studies of 105 patients who underwent first-time bilateral 1-to 4-level open laminectomies for degenerative lumbar disease at a single academic institution were reviewed. Patients who initially presented with listhesis and had additional discectomy or fusion procedures were excluded.
   RESULTS: Of 105 patients with laminectomies across 1e4 levels, 10 patients (9.5%; 5 men and 5 women with average age of 63.0 +/- 11.2 years) developed subsequent iatrogenic spondylolisthesis at the same operative levels that required reoperation. New or worsening low back pain and lower extremity pain were reported over an average period of 19.0 +/- 17.5 months postoperatively. Imaging studies showed new spondylolisthesis that was not present before the index surgery, most commonly at L4-L5 level. All patients were treated surgically with posterior instrumented fusion. The average period between the first and second surgery was 32.6 +/- 19.9 months. Surgical reduction of spondylolisthesis resulted in significant clinical improvement of patients' symptoms.
   CONCLUSIONS: In patients without overt pre-existing instability, laminectomy for lumbar stenosis can disrupt spinal stability and result in iatrogenic spondylolisthesis. The extent of decompression of the facet joints, number of levels decompressed, and preoperative disc space height can help assess the risk of postoperative spondylolisthesis. Patients who develop recurrent radiculopathy after decompressive lumbar laminectomy should be evaluated for potential iatrogenic spondylolisthesis.

DT Article
DE Boot camp; Collaboration; Faculty; Neurosurgery
ID SOCIETY; COURSES
AB BACKGROUND: For the first time in Southeast Asia, a Fundamentals of Neurosurgery Boot Camp was held at the University of Medicine 1 in Yangon, Myanmar, February 24-26, 2017. The aim of this course was to teach and train fundamental skills to neurosurgery residents.
   METHODS: The Myanmar Neurosurgical Society, Foundation for International Education in Neurosurgery, Society for Neurological Surgeons, The University of Medicine 1 in Yangon, Myanmar, and the Henry Ford Department of Neurosurgery developed a 2-day resident training course. Day 1 activities consisted of lectures by faculty, small group case discussions, and industry-supported demonstrations of surgical techniques. Day 2 activities consisted of hands-on skill stations for common neurosurgical procedures with each station supervised by attending faculty. Written evaluations were distributed before the meeting, immediately after the meeting, and 6 months after the meeting.
   RESULTS: Boot camp attendees included 40 residents and 24 neurosurgical faculty from Myanmar, Cambodia, Nepal, Singapore, South Korea, Thailand, and Vietnam. There were 35 evaluations completed before the boot camp, 34 completed immediately after boot camp, and 20 completed 6 months after boot camp. Knowledge of participants improved from 62.75% before boot camp to 71.50% 6 months after boot camp (P = 0.046).
   CONCLUSIONS: Boot camps provide fundamental didactic and technical exposure to trainees in developed and developing countries and help standardize training in basic neurosurgical competencies, while exposing local faculty to important teaching methods. This model provides a sustainable solution to educational needs and demonstrates to local neurosurgeons how they can take ownership of the educational process.

AB BACKGROUND: The rate of cervical spinal fusion has been increasing significantly. However, there is a paucity of literature describing trends based on surgical approach using complete population databases. We investigated the approach-based trends in epidemiology, indications, and in-hospital outcomes of cervical spinal fusion.
   METHODS: New York's Statewide Planning and Research Cooperative System database was queried to identify patients who underwent primary subaxial cervical fusion from 1997 to 2012. Demographic and clinical information was obtained. Subgroup analyses were performed based on surgical approach: anterior (A), posterior (P), and circumferential (C).
   RESULTS: A total of 87,045 cervical fusions were included. Over the study period, the population-adjusted annual fusion rate increased from 23.7 to 50.6 per 100,000 population (P < 0.001). A fusion was most common (85.2%), followed by P (12.3%), and C (2.5%). Mean ages were 49.8 + 11.9, 59.9 +/- 15.2, and 55.1 +/- 14.5 years (P < 0.001), respectively. Although rates remained steady among younger patients, they increased for older patients. Overall, degenerative conditions were the predominant indications for surgery and increased in rate over time. The mean length of stay was: A, 3.1 -1 10.5; P, 9.1 1- 14.1; and C, 14.1 +/- 22.5 days (P < 0.001). Rates of in-hospital complications were A, 3.0%; P, 10.5%; and C, 18.9% (P < 0.001), and mortality was A, 0.3%, P, 1.8%, and C, 2.5% (P < 0.001).
   CONCLUSIONS: The rate of subaxial spinal fusions increased 114% from 1997 to 2012 in New York State. Rates remained stable in younger patients but increased in the older population. Preoperative indications and postoperative courses differed significantly among the various approaches, with patients undergoing anterior fusion having better short-term outcomes.

AB BACKGROUND: Although most intracranial aneurysms can be treated with microsurgery or endovascular procedure alone, a subset of aneurysms may require a combined approach. The purpose of this study was to assess the efficacy of endovascular interventions combined with bypass surgery for the treatment of complex intracranial aneurysms.
   METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed medical records from a prospectively maintained patient database to identify patients who underwent endovascular treatment of an intracranial aneurysm at our institutes between 2007 and 2017. We recruited patients who received a preplanned combination of endovascular treatment and extracranial-intracranial bypass surgery.
   RESULTS: Forty-four patients (44 aneurysms) were treated with a combined approach. Twenty-four patients presented with subarachnoid hemorrhage. Treatment strategies included endovascular parent artery occlusion with the bypass surgery to restore cerebral blood flow (n = 12), endovascular trapping with bypass surgery to isolate incorporated branches (n = 12), and intra-aneurysmal coil embolization with bypass surgery to isolate incorporated branches (n = 20). During a mean period of 35.6 months, follow-up catheter angiography was performed in 35 of 44 patients (79.5%) and demonstrated complete aneurysm obliteration in 29 patients (82.9%) and bypass patency in 33 (94.3%). The postoperative aneurysm-related mortality and morbidity rates were 6.8% and 13.6%, respectively.
   CONCLUSIONS: Combined endovascular and surgical bypass procedures are useful for the treatment of complex intracranial aneurysms when conventional surgical or endovascular techniques are not feasible and show acceptable rates of morbidity and mortality.

AB BACKGROUND: Early postoperative patient surveillance after removal of intraventricular tumors is often hindered by delayed awakening and prolonged somnolence. The objective of this study was to analyze the incidence of early critical postoperative events after elective craniotomy for intraventricular tumors in adults compared with extraventricular lesions.
   METHODS: An observational comparative study was conducted on adult patients who had undergone first-time elective craniotomy between November 2011 and August 2016. Patients were stratified into extraventricular lesions (group 1) and intraventricular tumors (group 2). The rates of late extubation, early postoperative seizures, emergency head computed tomography (CT) scans, and urgent surgical intervention within 48 hours and mortality within 30 days of surgery were analyzed from a prospective database.
   RESULTS: A total of 977 elective craniotomies were analyzed, including 951 (97.3%) in group 1 and 26 (2.7%) in group 2. Emergency CT scans were ordered significantly more frequently in group 2 (34.6% vs. 8.4%; odds ratio, 5.76; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.49-13.35; P = 0.0002), and the incidence of urgent surgical intervention was significantly higher in group 2 (11.5% vs. 0.8%; odds ratio, 15.38; 95% CI, 3.83-61.72; P = 0.002). The main reason for urgent surgical intervention in group 2 was acute obstructive hydrocephalus. Overall surgical mortality after 30 days was 0.3% (3 cases in group 1, no cases in group 2).
   CONCLUSIONS: Intraventricular tumors are at significantly higher risk for early emergency head CT and urgent surgical intervention. This patient cohort might benefit from routine intraoperative and early postoperative imaging, as well as intraoperative extraventricular drain placement.

AB INTRODUCTION: The objective of this study was to analyze patients' perceptions of their headaches both before and after Pipeline flow diversion treatment of their unruptured intracranial aneurysms, with the goal of identifying prognostic factors associated with headache patterns to improve predictions of overall outcomes.
   METHODS: We retrospectively identified 133 patients treated with the Pipeline embolization device (PED) between January 1, 2014, and December 31, 2016, at an academic institution in the United States. Patients with at least 6 months of clinical follow-up, who had completed a validated telephone survey assessing their headache perceptions before and after treatment of their UIAs, were included.
   RESULTS: Sixty patients (57.7%) responded to the questionnaire. Median aneurysm size was 6.3 mm. Thirty-two patients (53.3%) presented with headaches before treatment, which had a median intensity of 7 out of 10 (range, 3-10). On postprocedural evaluation, 8 patients (25%) had complete resolution of their headaches. Of the 24 (75%) patients with persistent headaches, the frequency and severity of the headaches decreased or remained the same in most (58.3%) patients. Eleven (18.3%) patients had new-onset headaches. This study found an association between aneurysm size and a reduction in headache frequency and severity after PED treatment. No significant association was found between headache persistence, severity, or frequency and patient demographics, aneurysm characteristics, and other comorbidities.
   CONCLUSION: An overall improvement of headaches in patients with UIAs who underwent treatment with the PED was observed, particularly in patients harboring large aneurysms and who had presented with daily headaches.

ID QUALITY-OF-LIFE; PREDICTORS
AB OBJECTIVE: Common sequelae of subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) include somatic and/or cognitive impairment. This can cause emotional stress, social tensions, and difficulties in relationships. To test our hypothesis that more severe somatic and cognitive impairments increased the likelihood of disruption of a relationship after SAH, we assessed the integrity of marriage or partnership status in a well-evaluated subset of SAH patients.
   METHODS: Our sample comprised 50 SAH patients who were discharged to a neurologic, in-house rehabilitation center between 2005 and 2010. Deficits on admission to the rehabilitation center were divided into 18 categories and grouped into minor and major somatic deficits, as well as cognitive deficits. Clinical outcome scores, marital/partnership status, and duration of partnership before ictus were recorded. A follow-up questionnaire after 4.3 (2012) and 8.8 (2017) years was used to assess changes in marital/ partnership status. Possible predictor parameters were estimated and included in a stepdown regression analysis.
   RESULTS: In 2012, after a mean follow-up of 4.3 years, 8 of the 50 SAH patients were divorced or separated, whereas after 8.8 years only 1 additional relationship had ended. In our regression model analysis, a "short duration of relationship" before SAH and the presence of a "few minor somatic deficits" were associated with a higher likelihood of divorce or separation in the near future and remained unchanged at long-term follow-up.
   CONCLUSION: Contrary to our hypothesis, neither the presence of severe somatic or cognitive deficits nor clinical evaluation scores reliably predicted divorce or separation after SAH.

AB OBJECTIVE: The pathogenesis of venous intimal hyper-plasia and venous outflow stenosis associated with cerebral arteriovenous malformation (AVM) draining veins is poorly understood. We sought to determine the relationship between venous stenosis and age.
   METHODS: All patients with an AVM seen at our institution between 1990 and 2016 who underwent a diagnostic cerebral angiogram were retrospectively reviewed. Draining vein stenosis was measured from angiograms before any treatment. The relationship between venous stenosis and age was assessed.
   RESULTS: We included 281 patients (mean age 39 years, age range 3-83 years, 55% male). Venous stenosis measuring >= 50% was present in 59 patients (21% of cohort). Peak age at presentation was 25-29 years, whereas peak frequency of venous stenosis >= 50% was 50-54 years. Venous stenosis was present in a significantly higher proportion of patients >= 50 years versus <50 years (P = 0.03). Mean percentage stenosis was significantly higher in patients >= 50 years versus <50 years (32% vs. 22%, P = 0.001).
   CONCLUSIONS: Clinically significant cerebral AVM draining vein stenosis appears to be associated with older age, suggesting that venous stenosis is a progressive disease that occurs by the same process that leads to intimal hyperplasia. These results should be confirmed with a population-based longitudinal study.

AB OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to clarify clinical features, outcomes, and the role of tumor resection in precocious, synchronous, and metachronous brain metastases.
   METHODS: Brain metastases were found before primary cancer detection in the precocious group, within 2 months after primary cancer detection in the synchronous group, and 2 months or later after primary cancer detection in the metachronous group.
   RESULTS: Of 471 patients with brain metastases, 93 (20%) were included in the precocious group, 76 (16%) in the synchronous group, and 302 (64%) in the metachronous group. The precocious group tended to be symptomatic, show a low Karnofsky Performance Status, and have a large single tumor, infrequent extracranial metastases, and frequent tumor resection compared with the other 2 groups. There were no differences in overall survival from the detection of brain metastases among the 3 groups in univariate and multivariate analyses. Of 471 cases, 97 (21%) underwent surgeries. Among this surgical cohort, overall survival from surgery was significantly shorter in the precocious group than in the metachronous group (P = 0.039). After adjustment for age, sex, tumor size, primary cancer, and the Graded Prognostic Assessment score, the hazard ratio for metachronous metastases was 0.52 (confidence interval, 0.29-0.95; P = 0.035).
   CONCLUSIONS: The timing of brain metastasis diagnosis is not a modifiable factor but affects patient demographics and treatment strategies. In particular, the precocious group is a unique subset of brain metastases that require special consideration during clinical decision making.

AB BACKGROUND: Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is a well-established neuromodulation therapy for advanced Parkinson disease, essential tremor and dystonia. In as much as this therapy is being developed in the Middle East, a better understanding of the incidence and prevalence of movement disorders, health care, and social framework is required for the region.
   METHODS: We reviewed current literature on the incidence and prevalence of various movement disorders in the Middle East amenable to DBS surgery. We also assessed recent efforts to develop DBS in the region.
   RESULTS: Available data on incidence and prevalence of movement disorders in the Middle East are old, inconclusive, and conflicting. We identify key areas such as cultural background, availability of accessible information, training, infrastructure, and public support groups in the region that may pose challenges.
   CONCLUSIONS: The Middle East is projected to be a growing market for neuromodulation. The available data on incidence and prevalence of movement disorders is from studies that were small, partial, and old, with inconsistent results, highlighting the need for newer, better-designed, and larger studies. DBS in the Middle East will need assessment of incidence and prevalence of movement disorders, existing challenges to its application, and focused efforts on key opportunities to foster development of DBS for this underserved region. This article is an attempt to identify and explore these challenges and propose solutions in anticipation.

AB OBJECTIVE: This study used the uncinate process (UP) base the landmark to measure the various distances of the interested anatomic structures to improve the practicality of anterior controllable antedisplacement and fusion (ACAF) for ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament (OPLL).
   METHODS: Computed tomographic (CT) scan data of 20 OPLL patients were studied. We investigated the base distance of the UP, transverse foramen (TF) to UP base, pedicle to UP base, posterior to anterior UP, maximal width of OPLL, and width of the vertebrae-OPLL complex (VOC).
   RESULTS: Base distance of the UP shows an increasing trend from C3 to C7. The average base distance of the UP ranges from 14.6 mm at C3 to 22.7 mm at C7. The IF to UP distance ranges from 4.6 to 7.2 mm. The pedicle to UP distance is significantly shorter than upper levels at C7 and C6. The posterior to anterior UP ranges from -3.7 to -5.7 mm with an increasing trend from C3 to C7. The maximal width of OPLL is 13.2 mm on average. The mean width of the VOC in the ACAF cases is 16.8 mm on average.
   CONCLUSIONS: The results show that the UP can serve as a landmark for the location of longitudinal osteotomies in ACAF. However, preoperative measurement of CT images should be conducted for an individual dependent surgical planning of ACAF.

AB BACKGROUND: There is a dearth of literature regarding management and outcomes of patients with a left ventricular assist device (LVAD) for advanced heart failure who develop intracranial hemorrhage (ICH). We conducted a case series from 2 centers highlighting patient outcomes and prognostic factors to help clinicians better understand and care for these high-risk patients.
   METHODS: A case series from 2 large-volume institutions (defined as large by the Nationwide Inpatient Sample hospital size, i.e., >500 beds both with Departments of Neurosurgery and Advanced Heart Failure-Cardiology) was conducted to clarify the prognosis of patients with an LVAD and ICH. We included patients who were being treated with an LVAD who developed ICH. Patient-specific demographics and data regarding heart failure and intracranial hemorrhage characteristics were collected and analyzed to determine which factors contributed to overall survival.
   RESULTS: We analyzed 59 unique ICHs in patients being treated with an LVAD for heart failure. Initial Glasgow Coma Scale score, presence of midline shift, and ICH size were factors found to be predictive of mortality. One institution had a sicker patient population including patients with ICH with lower Glasgow Coma Scale score, presence of midline shift, and greater hemorrhage size, which led to overall higher mortality compared with the second institution.
   CONCLUSIONS: Patients being treated with an LVAD who develop ICH have poor outcomes. Predictive factors for same-admission mortality are lower initial Glasgow Coma Scale score, presence of midline shift, and greater ICH volume.

AB OBJECTIVE: To study the effects of intermittent whole-body hypoxic preconditioning on patients with carotid artery stenosis.
   METHODS: Fifty patients with carotid artery stenosis were selected and randomly divided into a hypoxic intervention group (HIG) and a control group (CG). Both groups were treated with a hypoxic respiration device for 7 days (HIG: 18% oxygen, CG: 21% oxygen). Venous blood samples were taken preoperatively and postoperatively. The subjects' vital signs were recorded during and after the intervention. After the completion of the trial, the concentrations of hemoglobin, hypoxia inducible factor-1 alpha, erythropoietin, vascular endothelial growth factor, neuron-specific enolase, S100 beta protein, brain-derived neurotrophic factor, serum aspartate transaminase, serum alanine aminotransferase, serum creatinine, and blood urea nitrogen were measured in the previously selected blood samples.
   RESULTS: During the intervention, the vital signs of the HIG were significantly different from those of the CG (P < 0.05). In the HIG, postoperative concentrations of hemoglobin, erythropoietin, hypoxia inducible factor-1 alpha, and vascular endothelial growth factor were significantly more than the preoperative values (P < 0.05). In the CG, postoperative concentrations of neuron-specific enolase and S100 beta protein were more than the preoperative values (P < 0.05). The concentrations of brain-derived neurotrophic factor, serum aspartate transaminase, serum alanine aminotransferase, serum creatinine, and blood urea nitrogen showed no significant differences between their preoperative and postoperative values in either the HIG or the CG (P > 0.05).
   CONCLUSIONS: Intermittent hypoxic preconditioning can change the vital signs and hematologic indexes of patients with carotid artery stenosis without causing new postoperative complications or organ damage.

ID VERTEBRAL ARTERY; CERVICAL-SPINE
AB OBJECTIVE: Pedicle screws placed into C2 necessitae a thorough understanding of this bone's unique anatomy. Although multiple landmarks and measurements have been used by surgeons, these are often varied in the literature with no consensus. Herein, we studied one recently proposed landmark using the nutrient foramina of the posterior aspect of C2 for pedicle screw placement.
   METHODS: On 19 (38 sides) C2 dry bone specimens, the presence, size, location, and distance from the midline of the nutrient foramina found at the junction between the isthmus and lamina were documented and measured. In addition, to discern the source of the artery entering such foramina, an injected adult cadaver was dissected.
   RESULTS: The number of foramina ranged from 0-5 with a mean of 1.84. On 3 sides, no foramina were identified. The mean diameter of the foramina was 0.57 mm. The location of the foramina was at position 1 on 9.5% of sides, position 2 on 66.4% of sides, and position 3 on 24.1% of sides. The mean horizontal distance from the midline of the spinous process of C2 to the foramina was 25.17 mm. In the cadaveric specimen, the source of the artery entering these C2 nutrient foramina was found to be distal branches of the deep cervical artery.
   CONCLUSIONS: We found the nutrient foramina of the C2 laminae are useful for pedicle screw placement. However, there are minor variations of the number and position of these structures. Lastly, on the basis of our study, 7.9% (n = 3) of sides will not have such foramina.

DT Article
DE Anatomical variations; AVM origins; Brain venous sinuses; Proangiogenic
   response; Venous hypertension
ID SUPERIOR SAGITTAL SINUS; FISTULAS; PATHOGENESIS
AB OBJECTIVE: Acquired anomalies of the dural venous sinuses (DVS) have been correlated extensively with the development of dural arteriovenous fistulas (DAVFs). Despite the known similarities of DAVFs' pathogenesis with that of arteriovenous malformations (AVMs), the relationship of venous sinuses anomalies with AVMs scarcely has been studied. We aimed to investigate whether patients with AVM show a greater prevalence of congenital DVS anomalies. We hypothesized that these congenital anomalies trigger AVM development during early childhood just as acquired DVS anomalies trigger DAVFs formation during adulthood.
   METHODS: Angiographic anomalies of the brain venous sinuses were studied in a cohort of 45 consecutive patients with AVM and compared with the angiographic; venous sinus anomalies of a control group formed by a second consecutive; series of 45 patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage.
   RESULTS: Congenital anomalies of any DVS were more frequent in patients with AVM than in the control group (49.8% vs. 22.2%; P = 0.015). Congenital abnormalities of the superior sagittal sinus not only were more frequent in patients with AVM (27% vs. 6.7%; P = 0.021) but seemed also related to the AVM location: in 5 of the 6 AVM cases with unilateral superior sagittal sinus aplasia, the AVM was ipsilateral to the venous anomaly.
   CONCLUSIONS: Patients with AVM have a greater likelihood of congenital anomalies of any DVS. These anomalies seem to be related also to the AVM location. These findings suggest that congenital anomalies of DVS may be related to the development of AVMs.

TI Multimodal Approach for Radical Excision of Focal Cortical Dysplasia by

LA English
DT Article

ID EPILEPSY SURGERY; SURGICAL-TREATMENT; RESECTION; EEG
AB BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Type II focal cortical dysplasia is the most common malformation of cortical development associated with drug resistant epilepsy and susceptible to surgical resection. Although, at present, advanced imaging modalities are capable of detecting most cortical disorders, it is still a challenge for the surgeon to visualize them intraoperatively. The lack of direct identification between normal brain and subtle dysplastic tissue may explain the poor results in terms of being seizure-free versus other forms of epilepsy. The aim of this study is to compare magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and intraoperative ultrasound-guided neuronavigation, along with cortical stimulation and acute electrocorticography, as a multimodal surgical approach to cortical dysplasia's tailored resection.
   METHODS: Six consecutive patients with type II cortical dysplasia underwent epilepsy surgery by means of MRI/ intraoperative ultrasound-guided neuronavigation. Intraoperative cortical stimulation of sensory/motor cortex was performed to localize cortical eloquent areas. Acute electrocorticography was used to identify epileptogenic tissue. These findings were correlated to real-time ultrasound imaging to establish the extent of the resection.
   RESULTS: Intraoperative ultrasound depicted cortical dysplasias at a higher resolution and accuracy than MRI. Therefore it maximized the extent of the resection. Both postoperative MRIs and pathology documented the extent of the resection in all patients. Seizure-freedom was achieved in 5 cases (Engel class IA), and in 1 patient it was classified as Engel class IB. No postoperative neurological deficits were observed.
   CONCLUSIONS: These results strongly suggest feasibility of ultrasound-guided resection of focal cortical dysplasia. Providing high resolution and accuracy, it allows an easy, real-time discrimination between normal and dysplastic brain.

AB OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study is to evaluate the clinical effects of cervical spinal cord injury without fracture and dislocation (CSCIWFD) treatment in a medium-to long-term follow-up study. The clinical treatment of CSCIWFD is also discussed.
   METHODS: A consecutive series of 42 CSCIWFD patients with complete follow-up data were retrospectively analyzed. Among these patients, 9 received conservative treatment and 33 underwent surgical treatment from June 2009 to March 2013. Neurologic functional recovery was evaluated according to the Japanese Orthopaedic Association (JOA) scoring system and the Frankel grade on admission, during hospital discharge, and at final followup. The average follow-up time was 49.6 months (range, 36-68 months).
   RESULTS: The 33 cases with surgical treatment showed significantly higher JOA scores at the final follow-up than those with conservative treatment. In addition, statistically significant differences were found in all of the follow-up visits between patients whose operations were performed within 7 days after injury and those performed after 7 days (P < 0.05). Early surgery promoted spinal cord recovery. However, JOA scores at 49.6 months postsurgery were not significantly different between patients treated via the anterior approach and those treated via the posterior approach (P > 0.05). On the basis of Frankel functional classification, differences were also significant between surgical treatment and conservative treatment at all of the follow-up visits.
   CONCLUSIONS: Early surgical treatment for CSCIWFD can directly relieve spinal cord compression. The medium-to long-term follow-up revealed that surgery clearly promotes decompression.

AB OBJECTIVE: To assess the mid-long-term follow-up of the safety and efficacy of anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF), cervical artificial disc replacement (CADR) and hybrid surgery (HS) for bilevel cervical degenerative disc disease (cDDD).
   METHODS: 77 patients who underwent ACDF, HS, and CADR were retrospectively reviewed. Clinical effects were evaluated based on Neck Disability Index (NDI), Visual Analog Scale (VAS), and Japanese Orthopedic Association (JOA) scores and the Odom criteria. Radiographic outcomes were evaluated, including cervical range of motion (ROM), ROM in the operative and adjacent segments, incidence of degeneration in the adjacent segments (ASD), and heterotopic ossification (HO).
   RESULTS: NDI, VAS, and JOA scores significantly improved in all patients after surgery without significant differences between groups. The excellent-to-good ratio in the Odom scale was 28/30 for the HS group, 30/33 for the ACDF group, and 13/14 for the CADR group. No significant differences in clinical outcomes or complication were found between groups (F > 0.05). Furthermore, the HS and CADR groups had less decreased ROM in the cervical and operative segments and less compensatory ROM in adjacent segments (P < 0.05). By contrast, the ACDF group had decreased ROM in the cervical and operative segments and significantly increased ROM in adjacent segments (P < 0.05). Moreover, the incidence of ASD was higher in the ACDF group, but the difference was not statistically significant (P> 0.05). HO was found in 10 patients (33.3%) in the HS group and 5 patients (35.7%) in the CADR group.
   CONCLUSION: HS was superior to ACDF with regard to equivalent clinical outcomes in the mid-long-term follow-up. Furthermore, HS was superior in the maintenance of ROM and had less impact on its adjacent segments. The efficacy of HS is similar to that of CADR.

AB OBJECTIVE: To investigate the relationship between single nucleotide polymorphisms or haplotypes of COL4A1 gene and the outcome of intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH).
   METHODS: In our study, 181 patients with hypertensive ICH were enrolled and followed up at 3 and 6 months. Outcome data included any cause of death and disability. Genomic DNA was extracted by DNA extraction kit, and the 6 single nucleotide polymorphism genotyping of the COL4A1 gene was detected through MassARRAY Analyzer. Unphased 3.1.4 and SPSS 19.0 were used to analyze the association between alleles, genotypes, and haplotypes of the COL4A1 gene and the outcomes of ICH.
   RESULTS: Of the 181 patients with hypertensive ICH, 12 were lost in follow-up, which accounted for 6.6%. Our association analysis showed that the rs532625 AA genotype of the COL4A1 gene may increase risk of disability at 3 months; the rs532625 A allele and AA genotype were association factors of the risk of disability at 6 months; the rs532625 AA genotype was an association factor of the risk of death/disability at 6 months. After adjusting for gender, age, coma, and severe neurologic deficits, only the rs532625 AA genotype was independently associated with the risk of disability at 3 and 6 months and the risk of death/ disability at 6 months.
   CONCLUSIONS: Our study found that the rs532625 AA genotype in the COL4A1 gene was independently associated with the risk of disability at 3 and 6 months and death/disability at 6 months in a Chinese Han population. These conclusions need to be verified in future studies with larger samples.

AB BACKGROUND: In the past decade, neurosurgery in Uganda experienced increasing surgical volume and a new residency training program. Although research has examined surgical capacity, minimal data exist on the patient population treated by neurosurgery and their eventual outcomes in sub-Saharan Africa.
   METHODS: Patients admitted to Mulago National Referral Hospital neurosurgical ward over 2 years (2014 and 2015) were documented in a prospective database. In total, 1167 were discharged with documented phone numbers and thus eligible for follow-up. Phone surveys were developed and conducted in the participant's language to assess mortality, neurologic outcomes, and follow-up health care.
   RESULTS: During the study period, 2032 patients were admitted to the neurosurgical ward, 80% for traumatic brain injury. A total of 7.8% received surgical intervention. The in-hospital mortality rate was 18%. A total of 870 patients were reached for phone follow-up, a 75% response rate, and 30-day and 1-year mortality were 4% and 8%, respectively. Almost one-half of patients had not had subsequent health care after the initial encounter. Most patients had Glasgow Outcome Scale-Extended scores consistent with good recovery and mild disability, with patients experiencing trauma faring best and patients with tumor faring worst. A total of 85% felt they returned to baseline work performance, and 76% of guardians felt that children returned to baseline school performance.
   CONCLUSIONS: The neurosurgical service provided health care to a large proportion of nonoperative patients. Phone surveys captured data on patients in whom nearly one-half would be lost to subsequent health care. Although mortality during initial hospitalization was high, more than 90% of those discharged survived at 1-year follow up, and the vast majority returned to work and school.

AB OBJECTIVE: This report examines the usefulness of the preoperative image to orient the surgeon in the sphenoid sinus during endoscopic endonasal transsphenoidal surgery (ETSS).
   METHODS: ETSS was performed in 100 cases of sellar lesion and used to classify the sphenoid sinus septum shape. Preoperative computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging were performed for 2 types of coronal imaging: conventional and oblique. Expected sphenoid sinus septum shape was compared with those from ETSS to estimate concordance. The confirmation rate of anatomic landmarks in the sphenoid sinus by endoscopic observation was compared in various types of septum and the identification rate in oblique corona! imaging was also examined.
   RESULTS: The most common septum shape was single type (31%), followed by branched (26%), parallel (18%), none (12%), cross (9%), and bridge (4%) types. In oblique coronal images, preoperative evaluation and endoscopic findings were consistent in 93%-100% of cases. However, with conventional coronal images, the concordance rate was 22.2%-83.9%, and in the none, branched, and cross types, the concordance rate was significantly lower than that for oblique coronal images. Although confirmation of the midline through estimation of landmarks by endoscopic observation was difficult in 33 cases, preoperative computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging showed landmarks in all cases and oblique corona! images best indicated the midline.
   CONCLUSIONS: Use of oblique coronal images in addition to conventional images provided good orientation of anatomic structures in the sphenoid sinus. The combination of preoperative imaging and endoscopic observation could allow safer surgery in ETSS.

TI Changes of Facet Joints After Dynamic Stabilization: Continuous
   Degeneration or Slow Fusion?

   motion
ID LUMBAR INTERBODY FUSION; FINITE-ELEMENT-ANALYSIS; DYNESYS; SYSTEM;

AB BACKGROUND: The nonfusion pedicle-screw system Dynesys stabilization (DS) for lumbar degenerative disease aims to better preserve range of motion (ROM) than fixation and fusion systems. However, decreased ROM and unexpected facet fusion at the index level were observed after DS was applied with unknown etiology. The aim of this study is using radiologic parameters to explain the phenomenon of facet arthrodesis.
   METHODS: The patients who underwent surgery for L4-5 spinal stenosis were sorted retrospectively into 2 groups: DS and microdiskectomy (MicD). Radiologic parameters including facet degeneration, evaluated by computed tomography or magnetic resonance image, and ROM, evaluated by dynamic radiographs, were compared perioperatively. A linear regression model was fitted to data points to calculate correlation over time. Postoperative facet arthrodesis at the index level was detected by computed tomography. Functional outcomes were also compared between groups.
   RESULTS: A total of 61 patients (DS-to-MicD = 38:23) were followed 36.9 +/- 16.8 months postoperatively. After surgery, both groups of patients had significant clinical improvement without difference between the 2 groups (all P > 0.05). In the DS group, significantly decreased ROM was observed after 24-month follow-up (P < 0.05). The correlation coefficient of facet degeneration over time and the facet fusion rate in the DS group were both significantly higher than in the MicD group (both P < 0.05).
   CONCLUSIONS: The patients who underwent DS for L4-5 grade 1 spondylolisthesis experienced significantly reduced ROM and a positive correlation of facet degeneration over time postoperatively. The limited ROM at the index level could be a potential risk of facet degeneration and cause unexpected arthrodesis.

AB OBJECTIVE: To retrospectively review the clinicopathologic features and computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings of lumbosacral intraspinal paragangliomas (PGLs).
   METHODS: Thirteen patients with surgically and pathologically confirmed lumbosacral intraspinal PGLs were enrolled. Their clinicopathologic data and imaging findings were retrospectively reviewed.
   RESULTS: Ten male and 3 female patients with a median age of 43 years (range, 36-74 years) were included. CT or MRI showed a well-defined (n = 13), oval (n = 10), or striated (n = 3) mass with heterogeneous (n = 6) or homogeneous density/signal intensity (n = 7). The lesions appeared isointense (n = 13) and mildly hyperintense (n = 13) on T1-weighted and T2-weighted MRI, respectively. On enhanced CT/MRI, markedly heterogeneous (n = 6) and homogeneous (n = 7) enhancement patterns were observed. The tadpole sign was observed in 9 cases. Systolic and diastolic blood pressure were higher before than after surgery (P-SBP, = 0.002 and P-DBP = 0.001). Both systolic and diastolic blood pressure were reduced to normal after surgery. No recurrence or metastatic disease was found during the follow-up period.
   CONCLUSIONS: Lumbosacral intraspinal PGLs should be considered when a mass appears as well defined or oval, and when a striated solitary homogeneous or heterogeneous mass is characterized by a tadpolelike appearance with a marked enhancement pattern. The fluctuation of blood pressure before and after surgery is an interesting clinical feature of lumbosacral intraspinal PGLs.

AB BACKGROUND: The S2 alar-iliac (S2AI) screw is a modification of the iliac fixation technique using the space between the neuroforamina of S1 and S2 as an insertion point to fix the sacrum to the ilium. To our knowledge, an anatomic review of the S2AI technique has not been described and the insertion point is vague and angles differ in reports from the literature. The purpose of the current anatomic illustration is to provide step-by-step techniques with fluoroscopic imaging to help confirm the safe placement of S2AI screws.
   METHODS: The procedure was performed on the left and rights sides of a fresh, frozen, and thawed predissected male cadaver in a surgical training facility through a standard posterior midline exposure for placement of the S2AI screws. All screws were placed by a fellowship-trained spine surgeon and an attending spine surgeon.
   RESULTS: The specimen was placed prone, and a midline incision begun at the L4 or L5 spinous process. Using the anteroposterior and inlet views, the S1 dorsal sacral foramen, the S1 endplate, and the sacroiliac joint can be identified. The insertion point is 10 mm laterally between the S1 and S2 foramina and near to the sacroiliac joint. Aim toward the anterior inferior iliac spine is ensured by using a 30 degrees-40 degrees lateral angulation in the transverse plane and 20 degrees-30 degrees caudal angulation in the sagittal plane depending on the sacral angulation. Using lateral fluoroscopy, the acetabulum and greater sciatic notch can be identified and screw misplacement can be avoided. The screw length is measured and is usually between 60 and 90 mm (8- to 9-mm diameter). An elevator is used to identify the outer sacral cortex. Anteroposterior, obturator-outlet, and teardrop views are used to ensure correct screw insertion.
   CONCLUSIONS: Fluoroscopic guidance is crucial for optimal S2AI screw placement. Using the described technique allows a safe and correct insertion of the S2AI screw.

AB OBJECTIVE: Artificial cervical disc replacement is expected to maintain normal cervical biomechanics. At present, the effect of the Prestige LP prosthesis height on cervical biomechanics has not been thoroughly studied. This finite element study of the cervical biomechanics aims to predict how the parameters, like range of motion (ROM), adjacent intradiscal pressure, facet joint force, and bone-implant interface stress, are affected by different heights of Prestige LP prostheses.
   METHODS: The finite element model of intact cervical spine (C3-C7) was obtained from our previous study, and the model was altered to implant Prestige LP prostheses at the C5-C6 level. The effects of the height of 5, 6, and 7 nun prosthesis replacement on ROM, adjacent intradiscal pressure, facet joint force, as well as the distribution of bone-implant interface stress were examined.
   RESULTS: ROM, adjacent intradiscal pressure, and facet joint force increased with the prosthesis height, whereas ROM and facet joint force decreased at C5-C6. The maximal stress on the inferior surface of the prostheses was greater than that on the superior surface, and the stresses increased with the prosthesis height. The biomechanical changes were slightly affected by the height of 5 and 6 mm prostheses, but were strongly affected by the 7-mm prosthesis.
   CONCLUSIONS: An appropriate height of the Prestige LP prosthesis can preserve normal ROM, adjacent intradiscal pressure, and facet joint force. Prostheses with a height of >= 2 mm than normal can lead to marked changes in the cervical biomechanics and bone-implant interface stress.

   RADIOSURGERY; OUTCOMES; SURGERY; NERVE
AB BACKGROUND: CyberKnife stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) for trigeminal neuralgia (TGN) administers non-isometric, conformational high-dose radiation to the trigeminal nerve with risk of subsequent hypoesthesia.
   METHODS: We performed a retrospective, single-institution review of 66 patients with TGN treated with CyberKnife SRS to compare outcomes from 2 distinct treatment periods: standard dosing (n = 38) and reduced dosing (n = 28). Standard and reduced dosing permitted a maximum brainstem dose of 45 Gy and 25 Gy, respectively, each with a prescription dose of 60 Gy. Primary and secondary outcomes were Barrow Neurologic Institute pain and numbness scores. Maximum brainstem dose, prepontine nerve length, and treatment history were recorded for their predictive contributions by logistic regression.
   RESULTS: After matching, patients in the standard dosing and reduced dosing groups were followed for a median of 25 months and 19.5 months, respectively. Mean trigeminal nerve length was 8.55 mm in the standard dosing group and 9.46 mm in the reduced dosing group. Baseline rates of poorly controlled pain were 97% and 88%, respectively, which improved to 23.4% and 8.3%, respectively (P < 0.001 for both). The baseline rates of bothersome numbness were null in both groups, and increased to 25% in the standard group (P = 0.006) and to 21% in the reduced group (P = 0.07). Regression analyses suggested that reduced brainstem exposure (P = 0.01), as well as a longer trigeminal nerve (P = 0.01), were predictive of durable pain control.
   CONCLUSIONS: These outcomes demonstrate that a lower maximum brainstem dose can provide excellent pain control without affecting facial numbness. Longer nerves may achieve better long-term outcomes and help optimize individual plans.

AB BACKGROUND: Chordomas are rare primary bone tumors that arise from the axial skeleton. Our objective was to analyze trends in radiation and surgery over time and determine location-based survival predictors for chordomas of the skull base, mobile spine, and sacrum.
   METHODS: A retrospective cohort study of the SEER (Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results) database from 1973 to 2013 was conducted. All patients had histologically confirmed chordomas. The principal outcome measure was overall survival (OS).
   RESULTS: The cohort included 1616 patients: skull base (664), mobile spine (444), and sacrum (508). Skull base tumors presented earliest in life (47.4 years) and sacral tumors presented latest (62.7 years). Rates of radiation remained stable for skull base and mobile spine tumors but declined for sacral tumors (P = 0.006). Rates of surgical resection remained stable for skull base and sacral tumors hut declined for mobile spine tumors (P = 0.046). Skull base chordomas had the longest median survival (162 months) compared with mobile spine (94 months) and sacral tumors (87 months). Being married was independently associated with improved OS for skull base tumors (hazard ratio, 0.73; 95% confidence interval, 0.53-0.99; P = 0.044). Surgical resection was independently associated with improved OS for sacral chordomas (hazard ratio, 0.48; 95% confidence interval, 0.34-0.69; P < 0.001).
   CONCLUSIONS: Surgical resection for mobile spine chordomas and radiation for sacral chordomas decreased over time. Patients with skull base tumors survived longer than did patients with mobile spine and sacral chordomas, and surgical resection was associated with improved survival in sacral chordomas only. Understanding the behavior of these tumors can help cranial and spinal surgeons improve treatment in this patient population.

AB Rationale: Little is known about the role of Aspergillus precipitating antibody (APAb) in patients with Mycobacterium avium complex lung disease (MAC-LD).
   Objectives: We investigated the clinical characteristics of patients with MAC-LD positive for APAb. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional study targeting patients with MAC-LD. APAb was checked in all participants. Clinical variables included laboratory data, pulmonary function, high-resolution computed tomography findings, and health-related quality of life.
   Results: We analyzed 109 consecutive patients. Their median age was 68 years, and the median duration of MAC-LD was 4.8 years. Twenty (18.3%) patients tested positive for APAb. APAb-positive patients had significantly longer duration of MAC-LD (9.4 vs. 4.0 years, P=0.017), more severe bronchiectasis evaluated by modified Reiff score (6.5 vs. 4, P=0.0049), and lower forced expiratory volume in 1 s (% FEV1) (75.1% vs. 86.2%, P=0.013) than APAb-negative patients. Analysis of covariance adjusted for background factors and underlying pulmonary disease revealed that % FEV1 was also significantly lower in patients with APAb (P=0.045). Ten patients were newly diagnosed with chronic pulmonary aspergillosis (N=5) or allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (N=5).
   Conclusions: APAb is associated with lower pulmonary function, and observed especially in patients with longer duration of MAC-LD and severe bronchiectasis, even in the absence of cavitary lesions.

AB Background: Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is commonly observed in patients with advanced idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). Despite the availability of therapies for both IPF and PH, none are approved for PH treatment in the context of significant pulmonary disease. This study will investigate the use of sildenafil added to pirfenidone in patients with advanced IPF and risk of PH, who represent a group with a high unmet medical need.
   Methods: This Phase IIb, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial is actively enrolling patients and will study the efficacy, safety and tolerability of sildenafil or placebo in patients with advanced IPF and intermediate or high probability of Group 3 PH who are receiving a stable dose of pirfenidone. Patients with advanced IPF (diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide <= 40% predicted) and risk of Group 3 PH (defined as mean pulmonary arterial pressure >= 20mm Hg with pulmonary arterial wedge pressure <= 15mm Hg on a previous right-heart catheterisation [RHC], or intermediate/high probability of Group 3 PH as defined by the 2015 European Society of Cardiology/European Respiratory Society guidelines) are eligible. In the absence of a previous RHC, patients with an echocardiogram showing a peak tricuspid valve regurgitation velocity >= 2.9 m/s can enrol if all other criteria are met. The primary efficacy endpoint is the proportion of patients with disease progression over a 52-week treatment period. Safety will be evaluated descriptively.
   Discussion: Combination treatment with sildenafil and pirfenidone may warrant investigation of the treatment of patients with advanced IPF and pulmonary vascular involvement leading to PH.

AB Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a heterogeneous disorder and patients respond differently to treatment. Blood eosinophils are a potential biomarker to stratify patient subsets for COPD therapy. We reviewed the value of blood eosinophils in predicting exacerbation risk and response to corticosteroid treatment in the available literature (PubMed articles in English; keywords: "COPD" and "eosinophil"; published prior to May 2017). Overall, clinical data suggest that in patients with a history of COPD exacerbations, a higher blood eosinophil count predicts an increased risk of future exacerbations and is associated with improved response to treatment with inhaled corticosteroids (in combination with long-acting bronchodilator[s]). Blood eosinophils are therefore a promising biomarker for phenotyping patients with COPD, although prospective studies are needed to assess blood eosinophils as a biomarker of corticosteroid response for this.

TI The impact of carrying supplemental oxygen on exercise capacity and
   dyspnea in patients with interstitial lung disease
SO RESPIRATORY MEDICINE
LA English
DT Article
DE Interstitial lung disease; Ambulatory oxygen therapy; Portable oxygen
ID IDIOPATHIC PULMONARY-FIBROSIS; AMBULATORY OXYGEN; THERAPY; EXPERIENCES;
   COPD
AB Background: May patients with interstitial lung disease (ILD) require supplementary oxygen (O-2) therapy to maintain normoxia. However, ambulatory O-2 delivery devices are constraining and cumbersome. The physiologic and symptomatic impact of these devices on ILD patients is unknown.
   Methods: We conducted a prospective study of 30 clinically stable ILD patients (with varying disease severity), half of whom used O-2 at baseline. Each subject completed two six-minute walk tests (6MWTs); for O-2 users, one walk was completed while wearing a backpack (weight 7.2 pounds) containing a tank with compressed O-2, and for non-users, one walk was completed with a similarly-weighted backpack. For each subject, during the second walk, no backpack was worn; for the second walk, O-2 users received oxygen via a stationary delivery system. For both walks, O-2 non-users wore a portable metabolic system, which measured variables related to respiratory physiology and gas exchange. Borg dyspnea and exertion ratings were recorded after each walk.
   Results: Wearing the O-2-containing backpack resulted in decreased distance covered during the 6MWT, and increased dyspnea and perceived exertion among O-2 users. While wearing the weighted backpack, O-2 non-users had a significantly lower peripheral O-2 saturation and distance-saturation product. Compared with carrying O-2 in the backpack, receiving O-2 via the stationary concentrator resulted in the largest improvement in walk distance for the three subjects with greatest impairment at baseline (6MWT <= 300 m).
   Conclusion: Among ILD patients, carrying portable O-2 versus receiving O-2 via a stationary concentrator results in significantly greater dyspnea and shorter distances covered in timed testing. Patients with the greatest impairment may be affected most. When prescribing O-2, practitioners should alert patients to this effect and help patients decide on the best O-2 delivery mode to meet their needs.

ID CHRONIC COUGH; GASTROESOPHAGEAL-REFLUX
AB Purpose: Cough Hypersensitivity Syndrome is the urge to cough following minimal stimulation, but its mechanism and method of provocation remain unexplained. 121 patients (44 males, 77 females; age range 18-81 years) were evaluated.
   Procedures: High resolution manometry was performed on consecutive patients presenting with unexplained respiratory symptoms (Respiratory Group 61). Data were compared with matched controls, i.e. dyspepsia without respiratory symptoms (Dyspepsia Group 60).
   Main findings: Results showed increased inspiratory gastro-oesophageal pressure gradient due to significantly lower intra-oesophageal pressure on inspiration (p = 0.001), and reduced oesophageal motility in the Respiratory Group.
   Conclusions: Further research in respiratory conditions characterised by decreased intrathoracic pressure during inspiration is needed.

AB Background: COPD is a major cause of morbidity and mortality across the world and new estimates of prevalence and trend are of great importance. We aimed to estimate the prevalence and trend of COPD from 1995-1997 to 2006-2008 in Norwegian adults >= 40 years from the Nord-Trondelag Health Study.
   Material and methods: COPD was assessed using a fixed-ratio and lower limit of normal (LLN) criteria. Pre-bronchodilator spirometry was performed during 1995-1997 (n = 7158) and 2006-2008 (n = 8788). The prevalence of COPD was weighted using the inverse probability of selection and predicted probability of response.
   Results: The prevalence of pre-bronchodilator COPD was 16.7% in 1995-1997 and 14.8% in 2006-2008 using fixed-ratio criteria, and 10.4% in 1995-1997 and 7.3% in 2006-2008 using LLN criteria. The prevalence of LLN COPD was higher among men (13.0% in 1995-1997, 7.7% in 2006-2008) than women (8.0% in 1995-1997, 6.9% in 2006-2008). From 1995-1997 to 2006-2008, the prevalence decreased among men but remained relatively stable among women. Over the 11-year period, the cumulative incidence of pre-bronchodilator COPD using LLN criteria was 3.3% and 2.7% among men and women respectively. The prevalence of self-reported asthma and respiratory symptoms increased.
   Conclusions: The prevalence declined in men but not in women from 1995-1997 to 2006-2008, and was consistently higher among men than women.

   Methods: A large-scale cross-sectional epidemiological study (ESMAA: Assessment of Asthma Control in Adult Asthma Population in the Middle East and North Africa) was performed in adults suffering from asthma for at least 1 year and without an acute asthma episode within 4 weeks. Asthma control was assessed per the 2012 GINA guidelines and the ACT questionnaire. QoL and adherence were assessed with the SF-8 and Morisky questionnaires respectively. Predictive factors of asthma control were analysed with univariate and multivariate logistic regressions analyses.
   Results: Overall 7236 eligible patients were included in 577 sites between June 2014 and December 2015 (median 10 patients/site). Mean age was 45 years (+/- 14), 57% were female, mean BMI was 28.5 kg/m(2) (+/- 6.0), and 11% were active smokers. Reliever medication was prescribed in 96% of patients with 65% having fixed-dose combined inhaled corticosteroid plus long-acting beta agonists. Good medication adherence was reported in 24% of patients. Among 7179 patients evaluable for GINA, asthma was controlled in 29.4% (95% CI, 28.4%-30.5%), partly controlled in 29.1% (95% CI, 28.1%-30.2%), and uncontrolled in 41.5% (95% CI, 40.3% to 42.6). The mean global ACT score was 17.8 (+/- 5.0), with 16% of patients considering their asthma as controlled. Poor medication adherence, active smoking, absence of medical insurance, lower level of education, or diagnosis at least 5 years earlier were significantly associated with uncontrolled asthma in multivariate analyses (p < 0.001).
   Conclusions: Asthma control in the Middle East and North Africa is unsatisfactory with less than one-third of asthma patients having controlled disease, highlighting the need to improve treatment access and medication adherence, along with better follow-up and education among healthcare providers and patients.

AB Background: Exercise limitation in COPD is multi-factorial. The contribution of cardiac function to exercise capacity is not clear.
   Methods: Potential determinants of the different constructs of exercise capacity (functional, peak and endurance exercise capacity using the 6-minute walk distance (6MWD), peak oxygen uptake (VO(2)peak) and peak work load, and sub-maximal constant work rate test (CWRT) cycle time, respectively) were analysed.
   Results: Data were collected in 516 people with COPD (56% male, age (mean +/- SD) 64 +/- 9 years, FEV1% predicted 49 +/- 20%). Participants had reduced exercise capacity (6MWD 424 +/- 124 m, 67 +/- 18% predicted; VO(2)peak 1090 +/- 414 ml/min, 66 +/- 30% predicted; peak work load 70 +/- 34 watts, 56 +/- 27% predicted; CWRT cycle time (median (IQR)) 225 (169-328) seconds). Cardiac function measures, including echocardiography and N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide level, were independently significantly correlated with exercise capacity. In multiple regression analyses adjusted for age and gender, 72% (p < 0.001) of the 6MWD variance could be explained, with the timed up-and-go test accounting for 32% of the variance. For VO(2)peak, 60% (p < 0.001) of the variance could be explained, with FEV1 accounting for 30% of the variance. Quadriceps total work was a significant determinant of all exercise tests.
   Conclusions: Cardiac function is related to exercise capacity, however is not a primary determinant. Determinants of the different constructs of exercise capacity vary, but there is a strong relationship between quadriceps force and functional and endurance exercise performance, and between lung function and peak exercise capacity.

AB Background: A high treatment burden with nebulised therapies in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients is the major limitation for treatment compliance; moreover, studies on treatment compliance with inhaled antibiotics are limited. This study assessed compliance to TOBI (R) Podhaler (TM) (TIP) treatment in CF patients with chronic Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Pa) infections in a real-world setting using the Italian Treatment Adherence CF Questionnaire (ITA-CFq).
   Methods: This longitudinal, multicentre, cohort study included 2 follow-up (FU) visits: FU-1 at 3-months +/- 15 days from the baseline visit and FU-2 at the end of third TIP cycle (or 6-months after enrolment, whichever occurred first). The effect of TIP on quality-of-life (QoL) and treatment satisfaction were evaluated using Cystic Fibrosis Questionnaire-Revised (CFQ-R) and Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire for Medication (TSQM), respectively. Overall compliance to treatments was assessed using ITA-CFq.
   Results: Eighty-two patients (mean age, 24.8 +/- 7.9 years), including 22 paediatric patients (age, < 18 years), were enrolled in the study; 56 (68.3%) patients, including 17 paediatric patients, completed the study. At baseline, the mean compliance score to aerosol antibiotic treatment was 7.8 +/- 3.2; upon introducing TIP, the compliance score improved to 9.4 +/- 1.2 at the FU-1 and thereafter remained stable at 9.5 +/- 1.2. TSQM was higher for the convenience domain (74.2 +/- 17.1 at enrolment and slightly improved to 77.8 +/- 15.9 at FU-2) following TIP initiation. No substantial effect of TIP was observed on the QoL when measured using the revised CFQ-R. The safety profile was in line with previous findings.
   Conclusion: TIP was convenient to use and led to improved treatment adherence in CF patients with chronic Painfection.

AB Background: Respiratory complaints after exercise are common in patients with rhinitis. Exercise-induced bronchospasm (EIB) may be one of the causes.
   Objectives: To evaluate EIB prevalence in a group of children and adolescents with allergic rhinitis, to compare the treadmill running (TR) and eucapnic voluntary hyperventilation (EVH) challenge methods as diagnostic tools and to assess the association between respiratory complaints on exercise and EIB.
   Methods: Patients aged between 10 and 20 years were studied at the Pulmonology Department of the Hospital das Clinicas-UFPE-Recife, Brazil. The severity of symptoms of rhinitis and exercise-related respiratory complaints in the past year were evaluated. Challenges were performed in random sequence, no more than 72 h apart and followed international guidelines. Forced expiratory volume in the first second (FEV1) was determined before and 3, 5, 7, 10, 15 and 30 min after each challenge. A > 10% reduction in FEV1 from baseline at two points after the challenge was considered sufficient to diagnose EIB.
   Results: Of the thirty-five subjects evaluated, thirteen (37%) showed EIB, six by both methods, three only after TR and four only after EVH (Coens' Kappa = 0.489). There was no association between respiratory complaints after exercise and EIB (p = 0.74).
   Conclusion: A high prevalence of EIB was found in this population but only moderate agreement between the challenges used to diagnose EIB. Caution should be adopted when comparing these methods or interpreting their results interchangeably. There was no association between reported respiratory symptoms after exercise and EIB.

AB Introduction: A combination of fluticasone propionate/formoterol fumarate (FP/FORM) has been incorporated within a novel, breath-triggered device, named K-haler (R). This low resistance device requires a gentle inspiratory effort to actuate it, triggering at an inspiratory flow rate of approximately 30 L/min; thus avoiding the need for coordination of inhalation with manual canister depression. The aim of the study was to evaluate total and regional pulmonary deposition of FP/FORM when administered via the K-haler device.
   Materials and methods: Twelve healthy subjects, 12 asthmatics, and 12 COPD patients each received a single dose of 2 puffs (99m)technetium-labelled FP/FORM 125/5 mu g. A gamma camera was used to obtain anterior and posterior two-dimensional images of drug deposition. Prior transmission scans (using a(99m)technetium flood source) allowed the definition of regions of interest and calculation of attenuation correction factors. Image analysis was performed per standardised methods.
   Results: Of 36 subjects, 35 provided evaluable post-dose scintigraphic data. Mean subject ages were 35.7 (healthy), 44.5 (asthma) and 61.7 years (COPD); mean FEV1% predicted values were 109.8%, 77.4% and 43.2%, respectively. Mean pulmonary deposition was 26.6% (healthy), 44.7% (asthma), 39.0% (COPD) of the delivered dose. The respective mean penetration indices (peripheral: central ratio normalised to a transmission lung scan) were 0.44, 0.31 and 0.30.
   Conclusion: FP/FORM administration via the K-haler device resulted in high lung deposition in patients with obstructive lung disease but somewhat lesser deposition in healthy subjects. Regional deposition data demonstrated drug deposition in both the central and peripheral regions in all subject populations.

AB Background: Asthma and COPD may overlap (ACO) but information about incidence and risk factors are lacking. This study aimed to estimate prevalence, incidence and risk factors of chronic airway obstruction (CAO) in a population-based adult asthma cohort.
   Methods: During 1986-2001 a large population-based asthma cohort was identified (n = 2055, 19-72y). Subsamples have participated in clinical follow-ups during the subsequent years. The entire cohort was invited to a clinical follow-up including interview, spirometry, and blood sampling in 2012-2014 when n = 983 subjects performed adequate spirometry. CAO was defined as post-bronchodilator FEV1/FVC < 0.7.
   Results: At study entry, asthmatics with prevalent CAO (11.4%) reported more respiratory symptoms, asthma medication use, and ischemic heart disease than asthmatics without CAO (asthma only). Subjects who developed CAO during follow-up (17.6%; incidence rate of 16/1000/year) had a more rapid FEV1 decline and higher levels of neutrophils than asthma only. Smoking, older age and male sex were independently associated with increased risk for both prevalent and incident CAO, while obesity had a protective effect.
   Conclusions: In this prospective adult asthma cohort, the majority did not develop CAO. Smoking, older age and male sex were risk factors for prevalent and incident CAO, similar to risk factors described for COPD in the general population.

AB Background: Cross-sectional and longitudinal studies describe shorter telomeres in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) compared to matched non-COPD controls, but the relationship is confounded by tobacco consumption. We hypothesized that telomere shortening would be similar between nonsmoking and smoking individuals with airflow limitation and shorter than non-obstructed controls.
   Methods: Telomere length (T/S) was measured by qPCR in blood leukocytes of 80 non-smoking patients and 80 age-matched smokers with airflow limitation. Forty non-smoker healthy individuals served as controls. Anthropometrics, lung function, previous and current comorbidities were recorded in all individuals. Relationship between telomere length and clinical and functional variables were explored in the three groups.
   Results: Telomeres length was similar in non-smokers and smoker individuals with airflow limitation (T/S = 0.61 +/- 0.19 vs. 0.60 +/- 0.23, p > 0.05) respectively. Telomere length was significantly shorter in both groups compared to healthy controls (T/S 0.79 +/- 0.40; p = 0.01) independent from age and sex. No significant association was found between the telomere length and clinical or lung function parameters.
   Conclusions: Telomere shortening is associated with airflow limitation independent of smoking status. Weather premature ageing or biologically determined shorter telomeres are responsible for this finding remain to be determined.

AB Rationale: According to clinical trials, azithromycin taken daily for 1 year, decreased exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).
   Objectives: Effectiveness evaluation of long-term azithromycin to reduce exacerbations in severe COPD patient on optimal therapy in real-life practice.
   Methods: We conducted a retrospective observational study of severe COPD patients who were prescribed azithromycin (PA)(250 mg, at least 3 times weekly for at least 6 months). Comparison group included severe COPD patients not prescribed azithromycin (NPA). Data were extracted from clinical chart review.
   Main results: Study included 126 PA and 69 NPA patients. They had severe airflow obstruction, mostly emphysema and one-third bronchiectasis. A predominant feature in the PA group was respiratory tract colonization with Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The mean number of exacerbations per patient per year in the PA group was 3.2 +/- 2.1 before initiating azithromycin, and 2.3 +/- 1.6 during following year on therapy (p < 0.001). Patients in the NPA group had 1.7 +/- 1.3 and 2.5 +/- 1.7 exacerbations during first and second follow-up year respectively (p < 0.001). Exacerbation changes from pre to post differed between groups (p < 0.001). Decrease in emergency visits and hospital admissions was significant in PA group. Exacerbation reductions and patient proportions having >= 2 exacerbations extended to the second year of treatment.
   Conclusion: These data showed that long-term azithromycin reduces exacerbation numbers in severe COPD patients, and benefits persist beyond one year. Desirable effects are more likely to outweigh the risks and adverse events in patients colonized with Pseudomonas aeruginosa.

AB Background: To describe and compare the comorbid conditions, the in-hospital mortality (IHM) and the length of hospital stay (LOHS) among idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) patients and non-IPF-matched patients hospitalized in Spain. We assess the performance of the Charlson Comorbidity Index[CCI] and the Elixhauser Comorbidity Index[ECI] to predict IHM in IPF and we identify the specific predictive factors of IHM in patients suffering IPF.
   Methods: We identified patients with IPF hospitalized in years 2002, 2006, 2010 and 2014. Cases of IPF were matched with non-IPF controls by sex, age, province of residence and year. Data were collected from the Spanish National Hospital Discharge Database.
   Results: We identified 10,285 hospitalizations with IPF, evidencing an increase in the number of IPF patients from 2002 to 2014. Overtime the prevalence of comorbidities included in the CCI significantly increased in patients with IPF, exception made of myocardial infarction and dementia. The prevalence of comorbidities included in the ECI, except paralysis and peptic ulcer disease excluding bleeding, increased significantly overtime. LOHS was longer among IPF patients than non-IPF controls and decreased significantly from 2002 to 2014. IHM was significantly higher in patients with IPF (adjustedOR 1.97; 95% CI 1.77-2.19). Area under the ROC curves showed that ECI model had a better performance to predict IHM than CCI.
   Conclusions: The incidence of hospitalizations for IPF increased significantly from 2002 to 2014. We observed an increase overtime of most of the comorbidities included in CCI and ECI. LOHS and IHM were higher in patients with IPF than in non-IPF controls.

AB Introduction: Although human intrapleural hyperthermic perfusion (HIHP) has achieved excellent palliative effects in metastatic pleural malignancies, the optimum treatment conditions, including inlet temperature and treatment times based on tumor size, have yet to be determined. However, such information is recognized to be critical for treatment planning in clinics. Therefore, the current research aimed to solve these issues.
   Methods: Using the finite-element method (FEM), a simplified three-dimensional HIHP model was established and verified according to the temperature data of specific measuring points based on a clinical therapeutic case. Ultimately, the treatment depth of pleural malignancies was obtained by employing an equivalent thermal dose of 80 min as the damage threshold.
   Results: The treatment depth of parietal pleural malignancies (PPM) is much larger than that of visceral pleura malignancies (VPM), and can therefore be overlooked. In addition, the average treatment depth of the PPM increased by 1mm as treatment time increased by 30 min during the 60-120 min time frame and as the inlet temperature increased by 1 degrees C, while there was no further increase when treatment time exceeded 120 min.
   Conclusions: HIHP can provide superior treatment for PPM and only provided faintly therapeutic effects on VPM, and may not be appropriate for the larger VPM. Although we only studied one example in this article, this is the beginning of an intensive study into the detailed thermal behavior of pleural tissues under HIHP, and further analysis on more realistic cases is currently underway.

AB Background: Several models for predicting the risk of death in people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exist but have not undergone large scale validation in primary care. The objective of this study was to externally validate these models using statistical and machine learning approaches.
   Methods: We used a primary care COPD cohort identified using data from the UK Clinical Practice Research Datalink. Age-standardised mortality rates were calculated for the population by gender and discrimination of ADO (age, dyspnoea, airflow obstruction), COTE (COPD-specific comorbidity test), DOSE (dyspnoea, airflow obstruction, smoking, exacerbations) and CODEX (comorbidity, dyspnoea, airflow obstruction, exacerbations) at predicting death over 1-3 years measured using logistic regression and a support vector machine learning (SVM) method of analysis.
   Results: The age-standardised mortality rate was 32.8 (95% CI 32.5-33.1) and 25.2 (95% CI 25.4-25.7) per 1000 person years for men and women respectively. Complete data were available for 54879 patients to predict 1-year mortality. ADO performed the best (c-statistic of 0.730) compared with DOSE (c-statistic 0.645), COTE (c-statistic 0.655) and CODEX (c-statistic 0.649) at predicting 1-year mortality. Discrimination of ADO and DOSE improved at predicting 1-year mortality when combined with COTE comorbidities (c-statistic 0.780 ADO + COTE; c-statistic 0.727 DOSE + COTE). Discrimination did not change significantly over 1-3 years. Comparable results were observed using SVM.
   Conclusion: In primary care, ADO appears superior at predicting death in COPD. Performance of ADO and DOSE improved when combined with COTE comorbidities suggesting better models may be generated with additional data facilitated using novel approaches.

TI No evidence found for an association between prednisone dose and FVC
   change in newly-treated pulmonary sarcoidosis

DE Sarcoidosis; Prednisone; Treatment; Lung function; Pulmonary
ID CLINICAL-TRIALS; THERAPY
AB Background: Prednisone is used as first-line therapy for pulmonary sarcoidosis. What dosing strategy has the best balance between effect and side-effects is largely unknown. We analyzed change in forced vital capacity (FVC) and weight during different prednisone doses used in daily practice for treatment naive pulmonary sarcoidosis patients.
   Methods: Multilevel models were used to describe FVC and weight change over time. Correlations were calculated using linear regression models.
   Results: Fifty-four patients were included. FVC changed over time (p < 0.001), with an average increase of 9.6% predicted (95% CI: 7.2 to 12.1) at 12 months. Weight changed significantly over time (p < 0.001), with an average increase of 4.3 kg (95% CI: 3.0 to 5.6) at 12 months. Although FVC and weight changed significantly over time, there was little correlation between prednisone dose and FVC change, while weight increase correlated significantly with cumulative prednisone dose at 24 months. In patients treated with a high cumulative prednisone dose, baseline FVC was on average lower (p = 0.001) compared to low dose treated patients, while no significant differences were observed in need for second/third-line therapy or number of exacerbations. A strategy leading to a low cumulative dose at 12 months was defined by rapid dose tapering to 10 mg/day within 3.5 months.
   Conclusions: These results suggest that prednisone therapy aimed at improving or preserving FVC in newly-treated pulmonary sarcoidosis can often be reduced in dose, using a treatment regimen that is characterized by early dose tapering.

AB Background: The clinical effects of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) on chronic beryllium disease (CBD) are unknown. Although frequently used for symptoms or disease not requiring systemic therapy, the clinical course of patients on ICS has not been evaluated.
   Methods: In a retrospective cohort study, forty-eight subjects with CBD, diagnosed by granulomas on lung biopsy and treated with inhaled corticosteroids, were matched to sixty-eight subjects with CBD who were not treated. Pulmonary function testing, exercise tolerance, blood BeLPT, BAL cell count, and symptoms were evaluated.
   Results: Treated patients showed no significant change over time in pulmonary function, when compared to controls, by forced vital capacity (FVC, p = 0.28) or diffusion capacity (DLCO, p = 0.45) or in exercise tolerance testing. However, symptoms of cough significantly improved in 58% (compared to 17% in controls) and dyspnea improved in 26% after ICS treatment (compared to 0 in controls). Symptoms of cough were improved in patients with a lower baseline FEV1 and FEV1/FVC ratio. Subgroup analysis showed significant lung function response in cases with lower baseline FEV1/FVC and higher residual volume (RV).
   Conclusion: Although FVC and DLCO did not improve in the ICS treated group, we saw no difference in decline compared to matched controls. Symptoms of dyspnea and cough improved with ICS especially in those with obstruction and air trapping suggesting that these should be considered an indication of ICS use in CBD patients.

AB Background: The role of CD4(+) T cells in the immunopathogenesis of pulmonary sarcoidosis is well-established, while less is known about the phenotype and function of CD8(+) cytolytic T cells (CTLs).
   Methods: CD8(+) CTLs were explored in peripheral blood and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) samples obtained from up to 25 patients with sarcoidosis and 25 healthy controls. The proportion of CTLs was assessed by the expression of cytolytic effector molecules perforin, granzyme B and granulysin in CD8(+) T cells, using flow cytometry. Cytolytic function in blood lymphocytes was assessed using a standard 51Cr-release assay. Patients with Lofgren's syndrome (LS) and an acute disease onset, were compared to non-LS patients with an insidious onset.
   Results: Higher proportions of peripheral CD8(+) CTLs expressing perforin and granzyme B were observed in sarcoidosis compared to healthy controls. Blood CTLs from non-LS patients had significantly higher expression of perforin, granzyme B and granulysin compared to matched BAL, while LS patients maintained lower levels of effector molecules in both compartments. Mitogen-stimulated peripheral lymphocytes from sarcoidosis patients, particularly from the non-LS group, showed a higher target cell lysis compared to controls.
   Conclusion: These results demonstrated enhanced peripheral CD8(+) CTL responses in sarcoidosis, especially in non-LS patients who have an increased risk of chronic disease. Further comprehensive clinical studies are warranted to increase our understanding of CD8(+) CTL responses in sarcoidosis.

   RANDOMIZED-TRIAL; PARALLEL-GROUP; METHOTREXATE; THERAPY
AB Background: Infliximab, a monoclonal antibody against tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) is effective third-line therapy in severe sarcoidosis. The originator product of Infliximab, Remicade (R), is expensive, limiting universal access. Recently, a less expensive biosimilar of infliximab, Inflectra (R), has become available, but the efficacy and tolerability has not been studied in sarcoidosis.
   Methods: In this retrospective cohort study, 29 patients treated with the infliximab biosimilar Inflectra (R), were analysed. Patients received Inflectra (R) intravenously monthly at a dose of 5 mg/kg. We measured trough levels before every infusion. Before and after 6 months of induction therapy pulmonary function and disease activity were evaluated using Standardised Uptake Value (SUV) of the F-18-fluorodeoxyglucose by positron emission tomography (F-18-FDG PET), soluble interleukin-2 receptor (sIL-2R), angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) and health-related quality of life (HRQOL).
   Results: In patients with pulmonary sarcoidosis as main treatment indication (n = 15) the predicted FVC improved with 8.1%, p < 0.05. Furthermore, in the whole group HRQoL improved significantly (p < 0.001), whereas SUVmax and sIL-2R significantly reduced (p < 0.001 and p = 0.001 respectively). Hospitalisation due to infections occurred in four patients. None of the patients discontinued Inflectra (R) due to side-effects. Furthermore, all patients had detectable trough levels indicating development of neutralizing antibodies.
   Conclusion: Infliximab biosimilar Inflectra (R) seems effective in the treatment of refractory sarcoidosis with a comparable safety profile to the reference product Remicade (R). Inflectra (R) can be considered as an alternative and less expensive option for patients with refractory sarcoidosis.

AB A modified Kalina cycle with parallel cogeneration of power and refrigeration abbreviated as PPR-KC was proposed and investigated. The cycle cogenerates refrigeration by further reclaiming heat resource from the boiler. A parallel branch of work solution is split at the outlet of the mid-p-absorber, and It undergoes pumping, generation, rectification and condensation before evaporation for refrigeration. Then the vapor from the evaporator goes to a mixer at the low-p-absorber inlet via a subcooler, while the dilute solution from the generator heats the basic solution in the second recuperator before going to the mixer via a throttle valve. The split fraction which determines the relative percentage of work solution flow rate for power generation or refrigeration can be altered arbitrary at user's demand. The parameter optimization was conducted and the optimum work concentration is 0.5 and the optimum basic concentration shall be adjusted with different split fraction. Under temperatures of heat resource/cooling water are 400 degrees C/30 degrees C and minimum pinch temperature differences in heat exchangers with/without flue gas are 20/5 K respectively, the comprehensive power recovery efficiency of the PPR-KC reaches 27.2%, which is 9.85% and 20.24% respectively higher than those of the cogeneration cycle proposed by Liu et al. and the Kalina cycle.

AB Baijiu (Chinese liquor) industry is the world-renowned industry to produce high-quality liquor using mixed biomass feedstocks including sorghum, wheat, and rice bran. A huge amount of Baijiu Diuzao (residual solid waste) is produced every 1-3 months after the fermentation. The present study was focused on evaluating the bioenergy potential of the Chinese liquor industry waste for the very first time. The collected sample was subjected to thermal degradation in an inert environment at three heating rates including 10, 30 and 50 Kmin(-1). It was shown that pyrolysis of this waste followed a three-stage degradation pattern, with a loss of 7.49% of the mass during the first stage at T <= 130 degrees C. While the second stage showed two zones ranging from 130 to 373 degrees C with an overall 51.12% of the mass loss. The third stage occurred above 373 degrees C and showed 16.08% loss in the mass. The released gases were subjected to TG-FTIR-MS analyses to monitor the composition and abundance of the gases where C=O groups (aldehydes, ketonic and carboxylic) and hydrocarbons were shown to be the dominating functional groups. Moreover, the data were subjected to kinetics, thermodynamics and reaction mechanism analyses using KSA (Kissinger-Alcahira-Sunose), FWO (Flynn-Wall-Ozawa), Vyazovkin and CR (Coats-Redfern) methods. Where, the activation energies (70-195 kJ mo(-1)), Gibbs free energy (177-185 kJ mol(-1)) and lower difference of enthalpy (Delta H = similar to 5 kJ mol(-1)) indicated remarkable bioenergy potential of this waste either through pyrolysis or co-pyrolysis. The artificial neural network (R-2 = 0.99) and reaction mechanism analyses indicated that the best thermal degradation chemistry was performed and described. This study will lead to establishing a thermal transformation strategy of this abundant and low-cost biological resource into energy and valuable chemicals in the cleanest manner.

AB A real-time optimization (RTO) strategy to find the optimal value of the fuel flow rate of a Fuel Cell Hybrid Power System (FCHPS) for residential buildings is proposed here, which is shortly named as Air_LFW-RTO strategy due to the use of Load-Following (LFW) technique to control the air flow. The optimization strategy uses the Global Extremum Seeking (GES) algorithm to adjust the fuel flow rate and harvest the FC power by using two GES control schemes. The performance obtained with Air LFW-RTO strategy proposed herein is shown compared to Static Feed-Forward RTO strategy, where both fueling rates are controlled by the FC current. The performance have been estimated for 8 kW residential building based on following indicators: the fuel consumption efficiency, the FC system efficiency, and the fuel economy during a variable load demand. The fuel consumption efficiency and the energy efficiency could increase with more than 11.47 W/lpm and 2.13% for a FCHPS under 8 kW constant load. The fuel economy could be up to 263 lpm for a FCHPS under variable load cycle using the Air LFW-RTO strategy.

ID DESIGN
AB The need of a more persistent human presence on sea is driving the development of increasingly more efficient Autonomous Underwater Vehicles. A particularly promising solution to power these vehicles is the retrieval of energy from the ocean temperature gradient. This paper investigates the use of thermoelectric generators (TEGs) for that purpose, by presenting a complete model of thermoelectric generators embedded in the hull of an underwater glider. The model includes not only the thermoelectric generators but also the heat transfer process and the behaviour of different heat storage materials. Several simulations are performed, for each storage material, to determine the adequate design parameters leading to sufficient energy generation for a thermal glider. It is shown that the use of Phase Change Materials (PCM) as an energy storage material is highly advantageous over the use of sea water or stainless steel. Furthermore, it is shown that this approach, although leading to a high number of TEGs and mass of PCM, is compatible with current existing glider dimensions.

AB A series of heterogeneous acid catalysts are synthesized from bamboo activated carbon through arylation using sulfanilic acid without reductant. Both the catalyst synthesis conditions and parameters for esterification of oleic acid with ethanol are optimized. The heterogeneous acid catalysts are characterized by XRD, FTIR, N-2 absorption-desorption, EDX and acid-base neutralization titration. At the molar ratio of benzylsulfonic acid group to bamboo activated carbon of 1, sulfonation temperature of 50 degrees C and sulfonation duration of 10 min, the heterogeneous acid catalyst presents the mesoporous microstructure with surface area of 225.71 m(2) g(-1) and pore volume of 0.12 cm(-3)g(-1), and total acid density of 1.69 mmol g(-1). With the catalyst added mass percentage of 12% (relative to the oleic acid mass) and molar ratio of ethanol to oleic acid of 7 at 85 degrees C for 180 min, esterification efficiency of 96% is achieved, which is higher than 91% of esterification with methanol at 65 degrees C. Microstructure shrinkage is the main reason for catalyst deactivation, and the regenerated heterogeneous acid supplies the catalytic efficiency of 94%.

AB A probabilistic modelling approach was developed and applied to investigate the energy and environmental performance of an innovative sanitation system, the "Nano-membrane Toilet" (NMT). The system treats human excreta via an advanced energy and water recovery island with the aim of addressing current and future sanitation demands. Due to the complex design and inherent characteristics of the system's input material, there are a number of stochastic variables which may significantly affect the system's performance. The non-intrusive probabilistic approach adopted in this study combines a finite number of deterministic thermodynamic process simulations with an artificial neural network (ANN) approximation model and Monte Carlo simulations (MCS) to assess the effect of system uncertainties on the predicted performance of the NMT system. The joint probability distributions of the process performance indicators suggest a Stirling Engine (SE) power output in the range of 61.5-73 W with a high confidence interval (CI) of 95%. In addition, there is high probability (with 95% CI) that the NMT system can achieve positive net power output between 15.8 and 35 W. A sensitivity study reveals the system power performance is mostly affected by SE heater temperature. Investigation into the environmental performance of the NMT design, including water recovery and CO2/NOx emissions, suggests significant environmental benefits compared to conventional systems. Results of the probabilistic analysis can better inform future improvements on the system design and operational strategy and this probabilistic assessment framework can also be applied to similar complex engineering systems.

AB Traditional horizontal-axis wind turbines are mainly designed as upwind configuration. In order to avoid blade strikes, the rotor blades have to be positioned far enough away from the turbine tower and have to be designed as inflexible as possible. In addition, a complicated yaw control system is required to keep the turbine rotor facing the incoming wind. Due to these drawbacks, the turbine in downwind configuration is proposed to overcome these disadvantages because, first of all, rotor blades can be designed more flexible since there is no danger of blade strikes, and secondly, yaw control system could be eliminated if nacelle is designed appropriately to follow the incoming wind direction passively. In the present study, a comparative experimental investigation was conducted to quantify the aeromechanic performance of a downwind turbine (DWT), in comparison to that of a traditional upwind turbine (UWT). The thrust coefficient of the DWT model was found to be increased slightly in the time-averaged quantity, but have a significant augment in the fluctuations. Due to the shadow effect, the power outputs of the DWT model was found to be decreased by 3.2% when they were operated in a same atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) wind. In addition, a high-resolution particle image velocimetry (PIV) system was employed to characterize the ensemble-averaged and phase-locked wake flow structures to quantify the turbulent flow characteristics in the turbine wakes. The velocity deficit in the lower half turbine wake for the UWT case was found to be greater than that of the DWT case at the location of X/D < 1.0. The higher wind load fluctuations for the DWT system were found to be correlated well with the higher TKE distributions in the turbine wakes. The phase-locked PIV measurements illustrated that the wake regions can be divided into four zones, which are dominated by the vortices shedding from different turbine components. The detailed flow field measurements were correlated with the dynamic force and power measurement data to elucidate the underlying physics.

AB In the present study, hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) of wet Scenedesmus obliquus biomass into bio-crude was carried out. Initially, the biochemical composition of S. obliquus biomass was examined, and it indicated high protein (56.1%) followed by carbohydrate (22.3%) and lipid (11.5%) contents. The ultimate analysis unveiled the presence of high carbon (48.1%) and oxygen (36.1%) in the biomass. This study had shed light on the selection of ideal reaction conditions such as temperature (200, 250, 300 degrees C), pressure (100, 200, 300 bar), and residence time (30, 60 min) for producing maximum bio-crude with/without catalyst aid. In the absence of the catalyst, a bio-crude yield of 35.7% was obtained at 300 degrees C temperature, 200 bar pressure, and 60 min residence time. On an interesting note, bio-crude yield was increased from 35.7 to 45.1% by adding homogeneous acid catalyst CH3COOH at 300 degrees C reaction temperature, which was higher than the other acid catalysts HCOOH (40%), H2SO4 (38%), HCl (39%), H3BO3 (37%), and the base catalysts NaOH (38%), KOH (37%), Na2CO3 (40%), K2CO3 (36%), Ca(OH)(2) (37%). Elemental analyses of bio-crudes indicated a higher heating value of 35-40 MJ/kg, carbon-74%, nitrogen-5.86%, hydrogen-10.9%, sulfur < 0.5 and oxygen content of 8.85%, which is comparable with petro-crude. Using CH3COOH as a catalyst in HTL led to reducing the oxygen content and simultaneously increased the higher heating value of bio-crude. In addition, GC-MS characterization of bio-crude indicated the presence of mono-aromatics, nitrogen heterocycles, phenols, indole and fatty acids. Thus, based on the yield and characteristics, the bio-crude produced from S. obliquus biomass could be used in petroleum refinery for fuel production.
