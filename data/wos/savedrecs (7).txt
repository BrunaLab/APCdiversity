LA English
DT Article
DE Brown-Sequard; Cord herniation; Operative video; Surgery; Thoracic spine
AB BACKGROUND: Idiopathic spinal cord herniation is a rare condition that involves spinal cord herniation through a defect in the ventral dura.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: We present a case of a 61-year-old woman who initially presented in 2016 with an approximately 1-year history of burning right lower extremity pain and gait instability. Her neurologic examination was consistent with thoracic BrownLSequard syndrome, and spinal magnetic resonance imaging showed a focal defect in the ventral dura at the superior aspect of T4 with the left aspect of the cord herniating into the defect. In 2018, she underwent a T3-T4 laminectomy with T3 pedicle take down and medial facetectomy, with reduction of the herniated cord.
   CONCLUSIONS: Idiopathic spinal cord herniation is an uncommon spinal cord disorder with a paucity of data reported. Our case report of a classic case of idiopathic spinal cord herniation presenting as BrownLSequard syndrome and managed surgically will contribute to the data in this field.

ID GLIOBLASTOMA; RELIABILITY; SCALE
AB BACKGROUND: Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common aggressive malignant primary brain tumor, rarely concurrent in patients who require deep brain stimulation (DBS) implants. Despite the high incidence of these circumstances alone, the coexistence of both in a patient has been seldom reported. In this paper, we report a case of a patient suffering from a movement disorder treated with DBS who developed a GBM.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A patient with bilateral DBS of the globus pallidus internus for refractory secondary dystonia developed a GBM close to the electrode leads, 2.5 years after implantation. The clinical findings, medical management and pitfalls, and possible relationship between the DBS device and the tumor development are discussed. We withdrew the system to perform brain magnetic resonance imaging safely. This revealed an extended lesion that was biopsied. The removal led to a clinical worsening that resulted in fatality, without the possibility of receiving adjuvant treatment. The available literature shows similar management, which depends mainly on the stimulation system used.
   CONCLUSIONS: We advise the use of magnetic resonance imaging-safe devices; otherwise, we recommend keeping the system and proceeding with computed tomography imaging for diagnostic and management if necessary. The true relationship between chronic DBS stimulation and GBM is to be clarified.

AB Surgical resection continues to predominate as the primary treatment modality in glioblastoma (GBM). Effective chemotherapeutic/biologic agents capable of targeting GBM have yet to be developed in part because of the exceptionally heterogeneous nature and unique microenvironmental conditions associated with this malignant neoplasm. Temozolomide and bevacizumab represent the only U.S. Food and Drug Administrationeapproved agents for primary and recurrent GBM, respectively. Given the high therapeutic resistance of GBM to current therapies, as well as the failure of bevacizumab to prolong overall survival, new therapeutic agents are urgently warranted and are now in the preclinical and clinical phases of development. Accordingly, clinical trials evaluating the efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibition, chimeric antigen receptor T cell therapy, virotherapies, and tumor vaccination therapy are all under way in GBM. Herein, we review the application of current/novel therapeutics in GBM and in so doing attempt to highlight the most promising solutions to overcome current failures.

TI Mirror Distal Anterior Cerebral Artery Aneurysms in a Patient with
   Subarachnoid Hemorrhage
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
LA English
DT Article
DE Coil embolization; Distal anterior cerebral artery aneurysms;
   Endovascular treatment; Intracerebral hemorrhage; Mirror aneurysms;
   Outcome; Subarachnoid hemorrhage
AB BACKGROUND: Mirror distal anterior cerebral artery aneurysms (DACAAs) are a rare finding in patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage, with only a few cases reported.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 40-year-old man was admitted for sudden-onset headache, nausea and vomiting, and transient right arm hypoesthesia. Computed tomography scan showed a subarachnoid hemorrhage with intracerebral hemorrhage within the interhemispheric fissure, but computed tomography angiography failed to identify any aneurysms. Subsequent digital subtraction angiography with three-dimensional reconstructions revealed 1.5-mm-diameter mirror DACAAs on the A3 segments. However, the definite rupture site remained unidentifiable. After interdisciplinary consultation, endovascular treatment was favored, and complete occlusion of both DACAAs was achieved by coiling without stent placement. During coiling of the right DACAA, a thrombus in the right callosomarginal artery formed, and treatment with abciximab (ReoPro) was initiated to dissolve the thrombus. After treatment, the patient presented with right leg paresis; however, computed tomography did not show any ischemia, intracerebral hemorrhage increase, or vasospasm. Over the following days, the leg paresis improved, and the patient achieved increased mobilization. He was transferred for further rehabilitation 16 days after hemorrhage. The leg paresis had recovered to a grade 3/5.
   CONCLUSIONS: Rapid identification of the rupture site in patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage and multiple aneurysms is crucial for initiating optimal treatment. In patients with mirror aneurysms in close proximity to each other, this is not easily accomplished, complicating treatment decisions. Although clipping has been the standard for DACAA occlusion, coiling should be taken into consideration as a viable alternative.

TI Surgical Outcome in an Iniencephaly Survivor: Case Report and Review of
   the Literature
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
LA English
DT Review
DE Encephalocele; Iniencephaly; Outcome; Surgery; Survivors
ID LONG-TERM SURVIVAL; DIAGNOSIS; FEATURES
AB BACKGROUND: Iniencephaly is an extremely rare congenital neural tube defect (NTD) involving the occipital region with rachischisis of the cervico-thoracic spine and fixed retroflexion deformity of the head. It affects an estimated 0.1-10 out of 10,000 pregnancies and carries a dismal prognosis. Most affected children are either stillborn or perish within a few hours of delivery. Pathological and postmortem studies of iniencephaly significantly outnumber the limited amount of literature available on patients surviving with this disorder. To date, surgical repair has been attempted in only 3 of the 8 patients with iniencephaly who have survived long-term. Thus, a huge knowledge gap remains regarding the neurosurgical nuances and postsurgical outcomes in iniencephaly.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 4-year-old girl presented with soft, fluctuant swelling in the suboccipital region and was subsequently diagnosed with iniencephaly. She underwent a successful surgical repair of the encephalocele with dural plication. No recurrence of swelling or new neurologic deficits were noted at a 1-year follow-up.
   CONCLUSION: Iniencephaly is a complex NTD associated with high perinatal mortality that requires a vigilant antenatal diagnosis. Surgical repair may be attempted in the lucky few survivors after a thorough evaluation of the anomaly.

   PLACEMENT; ACCURACY
AB BACKGROUND: Surgical approaches for posterior C1-C2 arthrodesis, such as C1-C2 transarticular and C1-C2 screw stabilization, are known to be demanding because of the anatomic close proximity of cervical vertebrae to neurovascular structures. Currently, navigation by fluoroscopy or intraoperative computed tomography (ICT) is the standard practice. However, fluoroscopy has various limitations, and ICT is time consuming and not available in many centers; furthermore, both diagnostic tools lead to exposure of the operating room staff to radiation exposure. We evaluate the safety, efficacy, and facility of a navigation system using only preoperative cervical computed tomography and computed tomographic angiography (CT/CTA), to prevent the risk of neurovascular damage in atlantoaxial stabilization.
   METHODS: The authors report a series of 21 patients who underwent posterior upper cervical spine fixation using a navigation system with intraoperative single-level vertebral registration on preoperative cervical CT/CTA (software BrainLab IPlan Spine 3.0). Intraoperative and postoperative comparative analysis was performed to verify the correspondence between the virtual anatomic position of the surgical instruments and screws represented on the neuronavigator, and the actual positions verified intraoperatively and on postoperative CT.
   RESULTS: Thirteen patients underwent C1-C2 arthrodesis with a Harms construct, 1 patient with transarticular screw fixation and 4 patients with occipitocervical stabilization. Three patients underwent C1-C2-C3 stabilization with C1 hooks, C2-C3 screws, and rod construct. On postoperative CT, the position of all screws appeared satisfactory. No neurovascular damage occurred in any patients.
   CONCLUSIONS: The use of a neuronavigation system, based on preoperative acquired cervical CT and intraoperative single-vertebra registration, may provide a valuable support for the improvement of the surgical accuracy of posterior C1-C2 screw fixation.

AB Increased intracranial pressure (ICP) is frequently encountered in the neurosurgical setting. A multitude of tactics exists to reduce ICP, ranging from patient position and medications to cerebrospinal fluid diversion and surgical decompression. A vast amount of literature has been published regarding ICP management in the critical care setting, but studies specifically tailored toward the management of intraoperative acute increases in ICP or brain bulk are lacking. Compartmentalizing the intracranial space into blood, brain tissue, and cerebrospinal fluid and understanding the numerous techniques available to affect these individual compartments can guide the surgical team to quickly identify increased brain bulk and respond appropriately. Rapidly instituting measures for brain relaxation in the operating room is essential in optimizing patient outcomes. Knowledge of the efficacy, rapidity, feasibility, and risks of the various available interventions can aid the team to properly tailor their approach to each individual patient. In this article, we present the first evidence-based review of intraoperative management of ICP and brain bulk.

ID ADVANCED HEAD; NECK; RECONSTRUCTION; RESECTION; REPLACEMENT
AB BACKGROUND: Indications for reconstruction of the common carotid artery (CCA) include trauma, iatrogenic injury, neoplastic growth (such as invasive neck carcinomas), postoperative infection, and cervical carotid aneurysm. Although various techniques and conduits have been described, the clinical scenario may preclude the use of the most commonly used grafts. We describe a case using a superficial femoral artery (SFA) interposition graft to repair the CCA and review the available literature, highlighting the feasibility of this technique for carotid artery reconstruction.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A patient aged 51 years presented with a ruptured mycotic CCA pseudoaneurysm that developed in the setting of a pharyngeal-carotid fistula. Because of the presence of a pharyngeal-carotid fistula and active infection within the vessel wall, endovascular treatment of the pseudoaneurysm was not feasible, and open surgical correction was required to repair the fistulous connection. Furthermore, owing to the extensive soft tissue infection, the use of a synthetic or venous autograft conduit for repair of the artery was contraindicated. Therefore, we harvested a segment of the SFA and used it as an interposition graft to reconstruct the diseased CCA, achieving an excellent anatomic and clinical result.
   CONCLUSIONS: This case highlights the feasibility of using an SFA interposition graft for short-segment CCA reconstruction, which can provide significant utility in the setting of a hostile operative field due to prior infection or radiation.

   Styloid process
ID ELONGATED STYLOID PROCESS; COMPRESSION; ISCHEMIA
AB BACKGROUND: Eagle syndrome with stroke onset is a rare condition. Carotid stenting of dissected arteries and/or surgical resection of the elongated styloid process are frequently performed; however, there are no definitive criteria for selecting these treatments.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 46-year-old man presented with left hemiplegia. Acute infarction in the right frontal and parietal lobes and bilateral internal carotid artery (ICA) dissection due to the elongated styloid process were diagnosed via magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography angiography. He was treated with stenting of the left ICA dissection, with observation of the right ICA dissection. However, the right ICA dissection deteriorated 4 days after the initial event, and additional stenting was performed. He underwent bilateral prophylactic styloidectomy with an extraoral approach 8 months after symptom onset. At >3 years after the styloidectomy, he has not experienced recurrence of the infarction.
   CONCLUSIONS: Stenting in the acute phase prevented the recurrence of stroke, and styloid process resection in the chronic phase cured vascular Eagle syndrome. This staged therapy could be beneficial in the treatment of vascular Eagle syndrome.

DE Frontal cyst; Neurenteric cyst
ID PATHOLOGY
AB Supratentorial neurenteric cyst is a rare entity. They are usually isointense to slightly hyperintense on T1W images and hyperintense on T2-weighted/fluid attenuated inversion recovery images. There was a diagnostic dilemma in this case due to the cerebrospinal fluid intensity of the cyst on magnetic resonance imaging. Postoperative residual lesion predisposes to hemorrhage and seizures.

AB BACKGROUND: Primary melanocytic neoplasms in the central nervous system are rare lesions arising from leptomeningeal melanocytes. These lesions produce neural deficits that resemble those of a meningioma or a schwannoma radiologically.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A tumor around the left S1 root with an extension into the left paraspinal compartment was identified in a 32-year-old female with persistent left leg pain for 6 months. The tumor was hyperintense on T1-weighted image and hypointense on T2-weighted image with a homogeneous enhancement. The clinical features, radiologic presentations, treatment choice, and pathologic characteristic were illustrated. The treatment outcome was compared with those reported in the previous literature. The tumor was en-bloc resected with the S1 nerve root reserved. Grossly, the tumor was a soft, capsulated, well-circumscribed, black pigmented lesion. Immunohistochemistry revealed that the tumor cells were positive for HMB-45, S-100 protein, and vimentin. The patient's symptoms were greatly relieved postoperatively. No signs of local recurrence were observed.
   CONCLUSIONS: Spinal meningeal melanocytoma inside the nerve root is rare and benign. It is difficult to diagnose and often misdiagnosed as schwannoma or meningioma. HMB-45 has been suggested as a significant marker for the diagnosis of meningeal melanocytoma. Complete surgical resection is recommended as the primary treatment. Radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and other treatments can be selected as adjuvant therapies, but their effects are controversial. The recurrence and metastasis rates also remain unclear.

AB OBJECTIVE: To describe a new method for cranial reconstruction after posterior fossa craniectomy in the surgical treatment of Chiari 1 malformation through a technical note and presentation of 3 illustrative cases.
   METHODS AND MATERIALS: A virtual surgical planning workflow was established for planning posterior fossa decompression, designing the suboccipital reconstruction, and manufacturing a 3D-printed polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) casting mold. The casting accuracy was assessed by conducting a phantom experiment, and clinical data were provided by means of 3 illustrative cases.
   RESULTS: The accuracy of implant fabrication was found to be excellent, particularly when PMMA is introduced into the mold in a malleable state. In all 3 clinical cases, the implants were fabricated and positioned with success. Postoperative analysis revealed that accurate placement was achieved, with only minor deviation from the preoperative plan.
   CONCLUSIONS: 3D virtual surgical planning provides feasible tools for the planning of posterior fossa decompression and intraoperative fabrication of accurate patient-specific suboccipital cranioplasty.

   CLINICAL PRESENTATION; MASSIVE HEMORRHAGE; POSSIBLE MECHANISM;
   RESECTION; GROWTH
AB BACKGROUND: Vestibular schwannomas (VS) are common slow-growing tumors that typically present with the insidious progression of unilateral hearing loss, tinnitus, vertigo, and gait imbalance. Clinically significant intratumoral acute hemorrhage is exceedingly rare and can present with the acute onset of symptoms, neurologic deterioration, and significant dysfunction of cranial nerves VII and VIII. We discuss a 40-year-old man who developed mild hearing loss and headaches over the course of a month before presenting with a large acutely hemorrhagic vestibular schwannoma. In addition, we review the current literature pertaining to this pathology.
   CASE PRESENTATION: A previously healthy 40-year-old man with a 1-month history of mild headaches, dizziness, and left-sided hearing loss, tinnitus, and facial numbness presented with the acute onset of severe headache, vomiting, complete left-sided hearing loss, and left-sided facial weakness. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging revealed a 4.1 x 2.7 cm hemorrhagic mass in the left cerebellopontine angle most consistent with VS. The patient subsequently underwent a retrosigmoid craniotomy and resection of the tumor. Pathology was consistent with hemorrhagic VS. Imaging at 1-year follow-up demonstrated no residual or recurrent disease, and facial motor function had completely recovered.
   CONCLUSIONS: Histologically, vascular abnormalities and micro-hemorrhages are nearly ubiquitous across vestibular schwannomas and may contribute to cystic degeneration and rapid tumor growth. However, clinically significant hemorrhage is rarely encountered and is more commonly associated with more profound neurologic sequelae and cranial nerve VII dysfunction. Surgical resection at the time of presentation should be strongly considered to remove the risk of repeat hemorrhage and further deterioration. Our case represents a typical presentation and clinical course for a patient presenting with this rarely encountered pathology.

TI Treatment of a Fusiform Anterior Cerebral Artery Aneurysm by Remodeling

DE Cerebral aneurysm; Flow diversion; Pipeline stent
ID ENDOVASCULAR TREATMENT; CAROTID-ARTERY; MANAGEMENT; OCCLUSION; PIPELINE
AB BACKGROUND: Fusiform aneurysms are challenging lesions to manage given their poorly understood natural history and lack of a distinct neck. Historically, they have been treated surgically but endovascular management has recently evolved as a viable alternative. In this case, we describe a novel flow diversion technique for treatment of a fusiform anterior cerebral artery (ACA) aneurysm by jailing the compromised parent vessel obtaining endovascular aneurysm trapping.
   METHODS: A 25-year-old man underwent brain magnetic resonance imaging and magnetic resonance angiography for workup of a headache, which revealed a fusiform right ACA A1 segment aneurysm. The patient subsequently underwent catheter digital subtraction angiography, which confirmed a 9 x 5.5 mm fusiform right ACA A1 segment aneurysm. The patient elected to undergo endovascular treatment. A Pipeline Embolization Device (Medtronic, Dublin, Ireland) was placed from the right anterior cerebral artery to the right middle cerebral artery, thereby jailing the right ACA A1 segment.
   RESULTS: At 6-month follow-up, the patient was asymptomatic and his headache had resolved. An angiogram was obtained, showing patency of the Pipeline Embolization Device and near complete occlusion of the right ACA A1 segment. The right ACA A2 segment remained patent via collateral flow through the anterior communicating artery. These findings were confirmed on magnetic resonance imaging. The patient remained asymptomatic for the duration of the follow-up.
   CONCLUSIONS: This case illustrates the efficacy of the Pipeline Embolization Device for treatment of a fusiform anterior circulation aneurysm via remodeling the circle of Willis.

AB Intraneural hematomas are an uncommon cause of a focal mononeuropathy. When they do occur, it is usually in the setting of inherited or iatrogenic coagulopathies or as a consequence of injections targeting nerves. We report a man aged 68 years on warfarin therapy for a prior pulmonary embolism who presented with a 6-month history of progressive weakness of knee flexion and ankle movement, excruciating pain, and dense numbness in his posterior left thigh and below the knee, consistent with a severe high sciatic palsy. Imaging depicted a contiguous cystic mass of mixed T1 and T2 intensities involving the left sciatic nerve in the thigh, which was radiologically interpreted as a hip arthroplasty-associated pseudotumor. The patient underwent surgical exploration, which revealed a thick hemorrhagic pseudocompartment within the sciatic nerve. The histopathologic diagnosis was consistent with chronic hemorrhage. These impressive lesions should be included in the differential diagnosis of nerve masses.

DE Intramedullary; Meningioma; Thoracic spine
ID SPINAL-CORD MENINGIOMA; MANAGEMENT; NEOPLASMS; DIAGNOSIS
AB BACKGROUND: Quite a few cases of intramedullary meningioma have been described in previously reported studies. We have presented a rare case of intramedullary thoracic meningioma, which was quite different from subdural extramedullary meningioma, and the preliminary diagnosis was mistakenly given as hemangioblastoma.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 46-year-old man with complaints of gait problems and pain in the right lower extremity was admitted to our hospital. The neurological examination revealed 3 of 5 motor strength, spastic paraparesis, hyperreflexia, increased tone, and sensory deficits in the right lower extremity. Contrast-enhanced images showed a T6-T7 intramedullary lesion and an evident and homogeneously enhanced lesion with clearly defined borders on the sagittal, coronal, and axial views. The preliminary diagnosis was hemangioblastoma. However, he underwent tumor resection, and the histopathological examination findings confirmed the diagnosis of intramedullary meningioma.
   CONCLUSION: Intramedullary thoracic meningiomas are extremely rare and differ from the common subdural extramedullary meningiomas. Clinicians should be aware of this when diagnosing intramedullary tumors. Gross total resection using a microsurgical technique will be the best treatment strategy.

ID DEGENERATION; EXPRESSION; CHILDHOOD; CHILDREN; GIRL
AB BACKGROUND: Calcification of intervertebral disc is a common impairment, which has been considered as the degenerative condition of the spine. In clinical practice, we note that the onset of intervertebral disc calcification (IDC) and ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament (OPLL) can exist simultaneously in some cases, especially in younger children. However, only 8 cases have been reported in detail previously. In addition, controversy remains in terms of the best way to treat this condition.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: An 8-year-old female child was referred to our department in March 2018 complaining of severe back pain and neck pain with a sign of neurologic dysfunction. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging revealed the calcified intervertebral disc and OPLL at the C5-C6 level and spinal cord compression. We performed a noninterventional strategy for the patient. The patient's symptom recovered significantly in approximately 1 month. At 6 months of follow-up, the patient felt no discomfort, and computed tomography revealed the complete resorption of ossified lesion. Magnetic resonance imaging also showed no sign of compression on the spinal cord and nerve root at the involved segment.
   CONCLUSIONS: Pediatric IDC accompanied with OPLL is much less frequent, but we must be aware of this disease. Since the distribution of this disease is age-specific and sex-specific, further research is necessary. Treatment for IDC combined with OPLL needs to follow the treatment principles as described in the text.

   Neurocytoma
AB Extraventricular neurocytoma (EVN) is an exceedingly rare brain tumor. The radiologic and histologic features of EVN are insidious, and only a few reports and clinical cases describe the characteristics of the tumor, which may show different presentations. We report a case of atypical EVN in a 23-year-old man; Computed Tomography and Magnetic Resonance Imaging features of the mass are described, and differential diagnosis are illustrated. In light of the high variability of imaging presentation, the definitive diagnosis of EVN remains histologic. Although some cases have already been reported in the literature, we believe that the description of our case could be useful to increase the knowledge of this insidious tumor, which has gained recognition only over the past 2 decades and should be included in the differential diagnosis in young patients who present brain tumors.

AB Only few case reports of intradural extramedullary-located cavernous angiomas are available. This report describes an extra-axial hemorrhagic lesion located on the lateral surface of the medulla oblongata at the foramen magnum. Follow-up magnetic resonance imaing clearly demonstrated growth of the lesion, probably due to repetitive intralesional hemorrhaging. Initially, a right vertebral artery aneurysm or an arteriovenous malformation was suspected. Digital subtraction angiography excluded these differential diagnoses, although doubt remained concerning the possibility of a thrombosed aneurysm. Preoperatively, the lesion did not had the typical macroscopical aspect of a cavernoma and appeared rather as an expansive encapsulated multicystic vascular lesion. Nevertheless, pathologic analysis confirmed the diagnosis of a cavernous hemangioma. Complete microsurgical resection was obtained without neurologic impairment.

AB Andreas Vesalius, the father of modern anatomy and a predecessor of neuroscience, was a distinguished medical scholar and Renaissance figure of the 16th Century Scientific Revolution. He challenged traditional anatomy by applying empirical methods of cadaveric dissection to the study of the human body. His revolutionary book, De Humani Corporis Fabrica, established anatomy as a scientific discipline that challenged conventional medical knowledge, but often caused controversy. Charles V, the Holy Roman Emperor and King of Spain to whom De Humani was dedicated, appointed Vesalius to his court. While in Spain, Vesalius' work antagonized the academic establishment, current medical knowledge, and ecclesial authority. Consequently, his methods were unacceptable to the academic and religious status quo, therefore, we believe that his professional life-as well as his tragic death-was affected by the political state of affairs that dominated 16th Century Europe. Ultimately, he went on a pilgrimage to the Holy Land that jeopardized his life. While returning home, his ship was driven ashore on the Greek island of Zakynthos (Zante) where he became ill and suddenly died in 1564 at the age of 49. Vesalius' ideas helped free medicine from the limitations of the 16th Century and advanced scientific knowledge. His influence is still felt more than 500 years later. In this article, we acknowledge Vesalius' neuroanatomic contributions and we discuss the historical facts and political circumstances that influenced his scientific career and personal life, emphasizing the conditions of his pilgrimage to the Holy Land that led to his untimely death.

ID RETROSPECTIVE ANALYSIS; SPINAL SCHWANNOMA; TUMORS; DIAGNOSIS; RESECTION;
   OUTCOMES
AB BACKGROUND: Sacral schwannomas are very rare nerve sheath tumors. Patients usually present with a variety of nonspecific symptoms, which often lead to a delay in diagnosis. Although most schwannomas are benign, they present surgical challenges owing to their proximity to neurologic and other anatomic structures.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: This 58-year-old female presented with a 2-month old history of left-sided perineal and radicular pain secondary to a right S2 sacral nerve root schwannoma. The sacral mass demonstrated homogenous enhancement with cystic changes in a T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging sequence. The patient underwent S1-S3 laminectomy and tumor excision through a posterior surgical approach. Intraoperative monitoring was used to distinguish nonfunctional tissue during tumor resection. The patient had an unremarkable postoperative course.
   CONCLUSIONS: Sacral schwannomas can present with a variety of nonspecific symptoms. They pose unique challenges given their location, size, and involvement of surrounding structures. Complete surgical resection is the main goal of sacral schwannoma treatment. A combined anterior-posterior surgical approach and a multidisciplinary surgical team are associated with improved outcomes.

DT Review
DE Bone invasion; Ewing sarcoma; Intracranial-extracranial extension
ID SKULL
AB BACKGROUND: Primary Ewing sarcoma arising from the calvarial bone and/or underlying dura matter are relatively rarely reported in the literature. Even rarer are considered to be those that originate from the dura and proliferate in both directions, toward the brain parenchyma and through the dura invading the overlying bone.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: We report the case of a girl aged 11 years who presented with an ictus of generalized tonic-clonic seizures, without known focal neurologic deficit. Neuroradiologic work-up verified the existence of a tumor in the right fronto-parietal area of the brain, invading both the bone and brain parenchyma and emanating from the dura. No other tumor location was discovered after radiologic work-up, and gross total resection was undertaken followed by adjuvant radiation therapy and chemotherapy.
   CONCLUSIONS: The patient had an uneventful neurologic recovery without persistent neurologic deficit. One year after the operation, with the patient under close clinical and radiologic surveillance, no recurrence of the disease was detected. This case illustrates an extremely uncommon location of primary Ewing sarcoma, along with a constellation of clinical signs and symptoms that are fairly uncommon for this location of this rare disease entity.

ID ANTIPLATELET; THERAPY
AB BACKGROUND: The development of flow-diverters such as the Pipeline embolization device (PED) have allowed for safe and effective treatment of challenging and/or previously untreatable intracranial aneurysms. A rare but serious complication during PED deployment involves fracture of single or multiple components, which can lead to retained hardware. To date, there are little data regarding the safety of performing magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) when tip or capture coils remain intracranially.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: To the best of our knowledge, we present the first case demonstrating the safe completion of MRI after treatment of 2 posterior circulation aneurysms in a woman aged 69 years presenting with subarachnoid hemorrhage whose treatment was complicated by fracture and subsequent retention of the PED tip and capture coils.
   CONCLUSIONS: MRI (1.5T) appears safe and effective in patients who have retained PED tips and/or capture coils.

AB BACKGROUND: We document a case of central nervous system infection with Trypanosoma cruzi.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: An 88-year-old woman presented with altered mental status, right-sided weakness, and slurred speech. Her medical history was significant for methotrexate intake for rheumatoid arthritis, and she tested negative for human immunodeficiency virus. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain showed bilateral thick and peripherally enhancing white matter lesions in the frontoparietal region with extensive surrounding vasogenic edema. A lumbar puncture revealed increased protein and lymphocytic pleocytosis, and needle biopsy highlighted brain necrosis, chronic inflammation, and numerous intracellular organisms suggestive of T. cruzi amastigotes. Despite treatment with benznidazole, the patient expired soon after presentation.
   CONCLUSION: Chagas disease should be included in the differential diagnosis of an immunocompromised patient presenting with a central nervous system mass, meningoencephalitis, or focal neurologic signs.

   DIVERSION; AGENESIS; MANAGEMENT; STENTS
AB BACKGROUND: Pure fusiform aneurysms of the anterior communicating artery (AcomA) are rare. We report a unique case of a patient with an AComA fusiform aneurysm in the setting of several unusual cranial neurocristopathies, including a hypoplastic internal carotid artery (ICA), persistent craniopharyngeal canal, transsphenoidal encephalocele, and ectopic, duplicated pituitary gland. We also review the literature on cranial base neurocristopathies and AComA fusiform aneurysms.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: This 46-year-old patient had a history of short stature, osteoporosis, obesity, cleft lip, decreased libido, congenital left eye blindness, headaches, and chronic nasal congestion. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed a 25 x 25 x 33 mm heterogenous soft tissue mass with an ectopic pituitary gland extending transsphenoidally and a duplicated pituitary stalk. A hormone panel revealed undetectable insulin-like growth factor 1 and growth hormone, central hypogonadism, and elevated prolactin. Before presentation, computed tomography angiography (CTA) had revealed a congenitally hypoplastic right ICA and 4.7 x 10.7 mm fusiform aneurysm of the AComA. Digital subtraction angiography confirmed stable morphology after 9 years. Nonoperative management of aneurysm and cephalocele was elected, with repeat CTA in 1 year.
   CONCLUSIONS: This case provides evidence that inherent arterial wall defects can contribute to fusiform aneurysm formation in the AComA. We propose that small AComA fusiform aneurysms without sclerotic or symptomatic features can be safely observed by describing the longest reported conservative management for this type of aneurysm. A high degree of suspicion for cerebrovascular anomalies should be maintained in patients who present with cranial neurocristopathy.

DT Article
DE Fishing sinker; Foreign body; Intracranial penetrating trauma;
   Sports-related injury
ID BRAIN-INJURY; GUNSHOT WOUNDS
AB BACKGROUND: Intracranial penetrating traumas (IPTs) are rarely encountered in neurosurgery practice. Here, we report the case of a patient with orbital and cranial trauma caused by an unexpected object.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 37-year-old male presenting with a right orbital penetrating injury was referred to our emergency department. Neurologic examination of the patient revealed right periorbital ecchymosis, a dilated and fixed right pupil, and right hemiparesis. Cranial computed tomography showed fractures of the right orbital medial wall and the anterior skull base, as well as bifrontal and left parietal intracerebral hemorrhage accompanied by a metallic foreign body artifact. Emergency left frontoparietal decompressive craniectomy was performed, and the foreign body, identified as a fishing sinker, was removed. No additional postoperative complications were observed, and cranioplasty was performed 6 months postoperatively.
   CONCLUSIONS: IPTs have high morbidity and mortality rates. Early surgical intervention is often the first treatment option. Intracranial injury caused by a fishing sinker is an extremely rare low-energy intracranial penetrating trauma, and in the literature, this is the first reported case in which the patient survived.

TI Supraorbital Approach to Basal Frontal Lobe for Resection of Brain
   Metastasis
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
LA English
DT Editorial Material
DE Basal frontal lobe; Eyebrow craniotomy; Metastasis; Supraorbital
   approach; Surgery
AB This video illustrates the use of the supraorbital craniotomy via an eyebrow incision for access to the basal frontal lobe. This approach is particularly useful for removal of lesions in the dominant hemisphere, where a transcortical approach could place speech centers at risk. The case is that of a 57-year-old woman who presented after a mental status change and was noted to have a large left frontal mass. The patient had a history of melanoma, and pathologic analysis of the intracranial lesion was consistent with metastatic melanoma. The patient underwent an uneventful gross-total lesion resection. The step-by-step techniques for performing this operation are illustrated (Video 1). Although not used in this case because we had an excellent view of the lesion, removal of the orbital rim allows the surgeon to obtain a better inferior-to-superior trajectory without using retraction. Of utmost importance to satisfactory cosmetic outcome are meticulous layer-by-layer closure of the eyebrow incision and maintaining pressure on the wound at the time of extubation. This pressure prevents accumulation of hematoma or cerebrospinal fluid, which places the wound under tension, impedes healing, and detrimentally affects cosmetic outcome. Additional adjuncts in this procedure may include hyperextending the head to bring the tumor into more direct view and drilling the skull base flush to expand the operative corridor. Minimally invasive approaches are excellent for the removal of metastasis because they are smaller incisions that remain well vascularized and heal quickly, allowing the patient to initiate adjuvant therapy sooner. The patient's family provided consent for publication.

DE Carotid artery thrombosis; Extracranial-intracranial arterial bypass;
   Internal carotid artery dissection; Stent
AB BACKGROUND: Acute stent thrombosis is a rare adverse event following endovascular treatment of carotid artery. Experience on the topic is scarce, making the therapeutic approach a clinical challenge. In cases of intraprocedural acute carotid stent thrombosis, thromboaspiration, thrombectomy, and thrombolysis have been used as successful modalities for achieving recanalization.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: We describe a case of carotid artery dissection treated endovascularly and complicated by intraprocedural stent thrombosis, which was ultimately managed by emergent extracranial-intracranial bypass with radial artery graft connecting the external carotid artery to the ipsilateral middle cerebral artery.
   CONCLUSIONS: Neurosurgical management may represent a rescue option for otherwise unmanageable acute carotid stent thrombosis.

AB BACKGROUND: Spinal myxopapillary ependymoma (sMPE) is an uncommon primary spinal neoplasm infiltrating the spinal cord, conus medullaris (CM), and nerve roots. It is associated with low resection and high recurrence rates. The purpose of this literature review is to evaluate the exact impact of the involvement of the CM and the role played by gross total resection (GTR) on overall survival (OS).
   METHODS: The English literature was systematically investigated using MEDLINE, the NIH Library, PubMed, and Google Scholar search engines with relevant queries. Case series reporting details concerning OS, GTR, and CM involvement rate were included, with a differential statistical weight given by the number of patients enrolled. A final cohort of 1602 clinical records was analyzed according to the 3 selected end point variables.
   RESULTS: The average age was 36.44 +/- 3.41 years, and the CM was involved in 28.4% +/- 28.2% of cases. The average GTR rate was 53.94% +/- 22.20%. Five- and 10-year OS rates were respectively available in 1170 and 1167 cases, with an average 5- and 10-year OS rate of 94.99% +/- 3.87% and 92.31% +/- 5.73%. By means of analyses performed both on aggregated and disaggregated data a strong positive statistical connection between GTR and increased OS was demonstrated despite the real clinical advantage could range as low as around 1% of increased OS rate.
   CONCLUSIONS: Given the indolent sMPE behavior, it is difficult to evaluate the exact impact of GTR and CM involvement on OS; however, GTR could be associated with a limited survival advantage, whereas CM involvement could be associated with a survival disadvantage.

ID EPSTEIN-BARR-VIRUS; LYMPHOEPITHELIOMA-LIKE CARCINOMA; LESION
AB BACKGROUND: This paper reports the case of a giant saddle area lymphoid epithelial carcinoma as reference for clinical diagnosis and treatment. The clinical data of 1 patient who suffered from giant saddle area lymphoid epithelial carcinoma that invaded the bilateral cavernous sinus and surrounding internal carotid artery, slope, nasopharynx, oropharynx, sphenoid sinus, and ethmoid sinus were retrospectively analyzed. The treatment process and relevant literature were summarized.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: The 68-year-old man was admitted to the hospital because of headache and dizziness for one half a year and aggravation of visual deterioration for 2 months. Magnetic resonance imaging showed a large mass in the saddle area, about 8.11 x 8.12 x 6.2 cm in size. Successful removal of the saddle mass was achieved under transnasal endoscopic approach, and postoperative pathology indicated lymphoid epithelial carcinoma. Visual acuity improved, and the patient recovered well after the operation.
   CONCLUSIONS: Giant saddle area lymphoid epithelial carcinoma is rare. Surgical removal should be selected as the initial treatment, and postoperative radiotherapy is indispensable for lymphoid epithelial carcinoma of the skull base and sinus.

AB OBJECTIVE: We performed a bibliometric analysis of studies reporting cases of brain and spinal arteriovenous malformations (AVMs).
   METHODS: We retrieved the 100 most cited reports in brain and spinal AVM research from Scopus and assessed the citation count, journal of publication and its impact factor, year of publication, first author and corresponding authors and their h-index, country, institution, department, and study category.
   RESULTS: The median number of citations per article was 215. The Journal of Neurosurgery was the most prolific journal (39 reports and 12,069 citations), including 9 of the 10 most cited reports. Seventy reports (19,251 citations), including 8 of the 10 most cited, were from the United States. The Barrow Neurological Institute was the most cited institution (7 reports; 2792 citations), and the Mayo Clinic had the greatest number of reports (8 reports; 1994 citations). Most studies had been reported before 2000 (71 reports; 19,262 citations). The most discussed topics were treatment (40 studies; 9560 citations) and natural history and/or clinical features (37 studies; 9595 citations). Neurosurgery was the most prolific department (58 studies; 15,860 citations). Spetzler was the author with the highest number of articles (n = 7) and citations (n = 2792).
   CONCLUSIONS: Brain and spinal AVM research was centralized in the United States, has been mainly reported in specific neurosurgical journals, and has been more often related to treatment and natural history and/or clinical features. It is possible that high impact AVM research has been decreasing recently. Because the best approach to these pathological entities remains controversial, research stimulation within this field should be encouraged.

AB Gross total resection of large intracranial meningiomas (LIMs) can be challenging and cause significant morbidity and mortality. The aim of this systematic review is to determine the clinical effectiveness and safety of stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) either as primary or adjuvant therapy for LIMs with tumors >= 2.5 cm in maximum dimension (tumor volume >= 8.1 cm(3)). A total of 452 tumors in 496 patients (350 female [69.3%] and 146 male [30.6%]) with median age 60 years (48-65 years) were included. The median tumor volume at the time of diagnosis was 16.7 cm(3) (10-53.3 cm(3)). The tumors typically were located in the skull base (77.2%), whereas only 14.6% were in the supratentorial space. The median follow-up after SRS was 54 months (18-90 months). In total, 87.8% of patients were treated with single-session (SS) Gamma Knife radiosurgery (GKS), whereas the remaining 12.1% patients received non-SS GKS. Of 452 LIMs assessed for clinical response, 45.1% showed improvement and 15.7% deteriorated after SRS. Radiographic tumor control at last follow-up (2-7.5 years) ranged from 84% to 100%. Overall, radiation-induced toxicity occurred in 23% of patients, with the most common adverse effect being cranial nerve neuropathy (5.5%) and peritumoral edema (5.3%). Subgroup analysis revealed that there is 2-fold greater likelihood of improvement in clinical symptoms in patients with non-SS GKS than SS GKS (odds ratio 2.47; 95% confidence interval 1.38-4.44; P = 0.002). SRS is safe and effective in the treatment of LIMs as primary or adjuvant treatment. Further prospective studies are required to validate our results.

TI Stent-Assisted Woven EndoBridge Implantation for Treatment of
   Wide-Necked Aneurysm Residual: Angiographic Video
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
LA English
DT Editorial Material
AB Woven EndoBridge (WEB) is an intrasaccular flow-disrupting device that has recently been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treatment of wide-neck ruptured and unruptured aneurysms at arterial bifurcations. Successful and effective treatment of aneurysms with the WEB device requires accurate sizing. For optimal positioning of the WEB device within the aneurysm sac, the diameter of the device has to exceed by the mean diameter of the aneurysm by 1.0 mm. However, this predictably results in an increase in the height of the device. In shallow, wide-necked aneurysms, this increase in height of the WEB device could result in encroachment of the device on the parent artery or branch vessel origins. In these circumstances, the placement of an intracranial stent can prevent such encroachment. In this video, we demonstrate the operative technique of stent-assisted WEB device placement that was performed at our institution for the treatment of a recurrent basilar apex aneurysm (Video 1). This previously ruptured aneurysm had been treated initially with primary coil embolization, and the patient consented to endovascular treatment of her aneurysm recurrence. The video illustrates this procedure using a combination of fluoroscopic images, fluoroscopic cines, and digital subtraction angiograms.

LA English
DT Review
DE Cervicothoracic fusion; Compression fracture; Gorham-Stout disease;
   Spine
ID SPINE
AB BACKGROUND: Gorham-Stout disease (GSD) or "vanishing bone" disease is characterized by progressive osteolysis with intraosseous lymphangiomatosis (hemangiomatosis). Given its rarity, with about 300 reported cases, its pathophysiology, etiology, and treatment guidelines are not established yet.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 22-year-old man was admitted to Severance Hospital with the chief complaint of neck pain from an injury due to falling. Initial cervical radiography showed a C4 burst fracture, and cervical magnetic resonance imaging revealed diffuse osteolytic lesions with coarse trabeculation with T2 hyperintensity and T1 enhancement in the entire cervical and upper thoracic area. He had a previous history of chylothorax that was still noticeable on a chest radiograph at the time of admission. A 2-stage operation was conducted. First, anterior corpectomy of C4 and anterior plate fixation of C3-5 were performed. Second, a week later, posterior fixation of C3-5 was performed. Thereafter, the patient was discharged without any neurologic complications. However, during the 1-month follow-up, asymptomatic progressive kyphosis was detected via radiography, and posterior cervical fusion of C2-T4 was performed. A minimal postoperative symptom of an intermittent left arm pain of 4-5 on the visual analog scale was experienced. No further deformity progression was noted until the last outpatient follow-up.
   CONCLUSIONS: Spinal GSD can cause severe deformity and neurologic deficits such as paralysis. Although treatment for GSD is not established, surgical treatment is recommended in severe deformity or aggravated neurologic deficit. The appropriate timing of surgery is after the arrest of osteolysis. Magnetic resonance imaging could be helpful in determining stable GSD.

AB Dural venous sinus thrombosis is a rare yet major cause of stroke and mortality, especially affecting young women and children. Anticoagulation is the mainstay of therapy; however, nearly 13% of the patients experience poor outcome with anticoagulation alone. 1 In addition, nearly one third of the patients with severe presentation have a risk of incomplete recovery with systemic anticoagulation. 2 The subgroup of patients who have incomplete recovery or who develop rapid deterioration in spite of anticoagulation can benefit from mechanical thrombectomy with or without intrasinus thrombolysis. Our patient is a 33-year-old lady on oral contraceptive pills who developed extensive dural venous sinus thrombosis after undergoing lumboperitoneal shunt for pseudotumor cerebri (Video 1). In view of clinical deterioration despite systemic heparin therapy, we performed mechanical thrombectomy and intrasinus thrombolysis using an Angiojet device (Boston Scientific Corporation or its affiliates Inc., Marlborough, Massachusetts, USA). The Angiojet system has the unique capability of a Power Plus technique in which thrombolytic agents can simultaneously be used to facilitate clot removal. However, its utility for intracranial use is limited by the stiffness, large (6-French) catheter diameter, and short length (120 cm). After the procedure, the patient achieved rapid clinical improvement and was maintained on systemic oral anticoagulation. In addition to the case presentation, the video article also demonstrates the technical aspects of mechanical venous thrombectomy.

TI Acute Hydrocephalus Requiring External Ventricular Drainage Following
   Perimesencephalic Nonaneurysmal Subarachnoid Hemorrhage in a Pediatric

   drainage; Pediatric neurosurgery; Perimesencephalic nonaneurysmal
   subarachnoid hemorrhage
AB BACKGROUND: Perimesencephalic nonaneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (PNSAH) is a well-described subset of subarachnoid hemorrhage with an excellent prognosis in adults. However, its characteristics in the pediatric population have not yet been fully understood. We present a case of acute hydrocephalus requiring external ventricular drainage following pediatric PNSAH.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A previously healthy 10-year-old girl was admitted to our neurosurgical department after sudden onset of severe headache with vomiting during exercise. Cerebral non-contrast computed tomography detected subarachnoid hemorrhage filling all perimesencephalic cisterns. However, digital subtraction angiography could not locate the hemorrhage source. Her consciousness deteriorated within 7 hours of onset, and a computed tomography scan revealed acute hydrocephalus. We subjected the patient to external ventricular drainage for 10 days. She was discharged after 38 days of hospitalization, when she was physically and neuropsychologically healthy. Repeated digital subtraction angiography performed at the 6-month follow-up did not show any obvious source of hemorrhage except for a variant drainage pattern of the basal vein of Rosenthal. Based on the observations, we diagnosed the patient with PNSAH of a venous origin.
   CONCLUSIONS: We propose that acute hydrocephalus be suspected in pediatric patients with nonaneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage filling all perimesencephalic cisterns, as in adults. We also propose that one of the possible causes of pediatric PNSAH as of venous origin and related to the abnormal drainage pattern of basal vein of Rosenthal and elevation of venous pressure with exercise. Immediate surgical drainage could obtain a good outcome in a symptomatic case.

ID NONANEURYSMAL SUBARACHNOID HEMORRHAGE; FOLLOW-UP; VENOUS DRAINAGE;
   PATTERNS; YIELD
AB BACKGROUND: Perimesencephalic hemorrhage (PMH), a subtype of non-aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage, is characterized by a typical pattern of localized hemorrhage on head computed tomography. PMH is usually associated with a benign clinical course, and a lower incidence of complications such as vasospasm and rebleeding.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: We present the cases of a man aged 28 years and a woman aged 21 years with no relevant medical history who experienced recurrent, spontaneous episodes of PMH within the course of 7 days and 29 months. No precipitating causes were identified.
   CONCLUSIONS: There are only a couple of case reports of recurrent PMH, some of which were defined questionably. We review the reported cases and discuss the possible causes and long-term outcomes. Neurointerventionalists and neurosurgeons should be aware that the risk of recurrent hemorrhage of PMH does exist, although it is rather low. Even after early or late rebleeding, prognosis of PMH is excellent.

TI Internal Carotid Artery Bleed: A Rare Complication of Invasive
   Sphenoidal Aspergillosis
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
LA English
DT Article
DE Aspergillosis; Internal carotid artery; Invasive Aspergillus sinusitis
AB BACKGROUND: Invasive sinonasal aspergillosis is rarely seen in immunocompetent individuals. It may involve adjacent intracranial and intraorbital structures causing high morbidity and mortality.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: We report a rare case of invasive Aspergillus sinusitis in a young, immunocompetent woman causing headache and vision loss. Endoscopic debridement under general anesthesia was complicated by rupture of a mycotic cavernous carotid artery aneurysm. This was managed by packing with muscle and fascia followed by endovascular coiling. Subsequently, the aneurysm extended intradurally and caused fatal subarachnoid hemorrhage.
   CONCLUSIONS: This case emphasizes the need for early diagnosis of invasive fungal sinusitis to prevent intracranial complications and fatal outcome. When the diagnosis is made, aggressive treatment with surgical debridement and adjuvant antifungal therapy is required. Internal carotid artery involvement is a rare but life-threatening complication of invasive fungal sinusitis.

TI Stabbing Injury of the Cervical Spinal Cord Resulting in Complete Loss

SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
LA English
DT Article
DE Spinal cord injury; Stabbing
AB BACKGROUND: Direct penetrating trauma to the spinal cord as a result of stabbing is rare. The vertebral column is strongly suited to protecting the vital neural structures underneath, especially in the midline.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 25-year-old woman experienced a direct stabbing injury to her spinal cord, through the midline structures, resulting in bilateral dorsal column injury. She remained intact with regard to motor function despite bilateral sensory and proprioception loss.
   CONCLUSIONS: Owing to the strength of the protective elements of the osseous structures surrounding the spinal cord, direct stabbing injuries usually result in incomplete neurologic deficits. This is generally manifested as a Brown-Sequard syndrome because of the midline ligamentous structures and spinous processes deflecting injuries laterally. Our patient experienced a direct midline puncture, resulting in a unique case of bilateral dorsal column injury. These injuries are generally treated conservatively, in the absence of a retained foreign body. Spinal cord stabbing injuries are a rare entity with interesting clinical and anatomic correlations.

TI A Self-Made, Reusable, and Adjustable Device for Making Burr Hole Bone
   Plugs: Doing More with Less
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
LA English
DT Article
DE Bone dust; Bone packer; Bone plug; Burr hole; Craniotomy; Skin dent
AB BACKGROUND: Burr hole craniotomy is a daily procedure in neurosurgery. Defects after burr hole craniotomies will not spontaneously heal and can result in skin dents and cosmetic dissatisfaction. We have introduced a self-made, reusable, and adjustable bone plug packer to use in the repair of burr holes via packing of autologous bone dust. Our bone plug packer is free of charge and can be readily available in neurosurgical operating rooms.
   METHODS: We have produced a stainless steel bone packer device that can be assembled without the use of a special wrench. The instrument consists of a container plate and a main cylinder for packing, in which an adjustable airtight piston is placed to compress the bone dust and create a bone plug of the desired dimensions.
   RESULTS: Some recent studies have shown that burr holes filled by autologous bone dust will result in good cosmetic and osteogenic outcomes. Although we did not perform a long-term follow-up assessment of the burr holes filled with bone plugs, in the short term, we have not seen any local reactions or infections in our patients. The autologous bone plug is a more affordable and available option with no technical or clinical complications in the short term.
   CONCLUSION: We have introduced a practical, convenient, and cost-effective bone packer device. Bone plugs formed using our device can be a potential substitute for expensive covering materials in countries with limited access to other repair options. Providing proper evidence will require the performance of large studies to assess our suggested method in the long term and, possibly, compare it with the usual options in controlled studies.

AB BACKGROUND: Intracranial extraskeletal mesenchymal chondrosarcoma is a rare, malignant variant of chondrosarcoma that is characterized by undifferentiated mesenchymal cells interspersed with pockets of mature hyaline cartilage.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: In this study, we report a 23-year-old female patient who underwent multiple craniotomies for tumor resection, as well as adjuvant radiotherapy and chemotherapy. We review the literature for reported cases and discuss the histopathologic features, radiologic findings, therapeutic approaches, and outcomes associated with this rare tumor.
   CONCLUSIONS: Intracranial extra-skeletal mesenchymal chondrosarcomas are very aggressive tumors, and their management should emphasize attempting gross total resection followed by adjuvant treatment modalities, including radiation therapy and/or chemotherapy.

AB BACKGROUND: Intramedullary spinal cord cavernous malformations (ISCCMs) are a rare entity. Most commonly, ISCCMs present with neurologic decline from lesion hemorrhage, which can be catastrophic and irreversible irrespective of surgical intervention. Given the challenging anatomic location of these lesions in highly critical neurologic areas, precise surgical localization and visualization is necessary to limit collateral damage during resection particularly for deep ISCCMs that do not present to a pial surface.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: We present a case of a 54-year-old man who presented with incomplete paraplegia after hemorrhage of a deep ISCCM at T11. Surgical resection was undertaken using intraoperative computed tomography (CT) navigation assistance autofused with high-resolution preoperative magnetic resonance imaging for precise intramedullary lesion targeting and localization for myelotomy. Complete resection was demonstrated on postoperative imaging. At a 6-week follow-up appointment, the patient endorsed return of his bladder function and was noted to have some return of motor function to his left foot with 3 of 5 dorsiflexion. At 4 months, he had improved to 3 of 5 proximal, 4 of 5 distal on the left and 2 of 5 proximal, and 3 of 5 distal on the right.
   CONCLUSIONS: The approach represents a novel application of intraoperative CT navigation assistance in the resection of deep ISCCMs.

SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
LA English
DT Article
DE Anterior inferior cerebellar artery; Posterior inferior cerebellar
   artery; Thrombectomy
AB BACKGROUND: Acute anterior inferior cerebellar artery (AICA) occlusion is considered an acute ischemic stroke requiring medical treatment without mechanical thrombectomy (MT). There is a procedural risk of parent vessel rupture, but neurologic deficits are not generally severe. Here, we report a case of MT performed using partially deployed stent retrieval for acute AICA occlusion.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 53-year-old male patient presented with acute-onset drowsiness and visual disturbance. The initial National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score of the patient was 5. Computed tomography angiography showed no definite vascular occlusion, but computed tomography perfusion imaging suggested decreased cerebral blood flow and cerebral blood volume, with an increased mean transit time and time to peak in the left posterior inferior cerebellar artery territory. Conventional angiography showed occlusion of the left proximal AICA and posterior inferior cerebellar artery cortical branches, which were reconstituted by the muscular branches of the left vertebral artery. We decided to perform intra-arterial thrombectomy for proximal left AICA occlusion because the patient's symptoms seemed to be aggravated, and neurologic deficits were not expected. MT was performed using a Trevo stent (Stryker Neurovascular, Fremont, California, USA) in the left proximal AICA via a right vertebral artery approach and resulted in complete recanalization of the occluded AICA. The patient recovered and had an National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score of 0 at 1 day after MT.
   CONCLUSIONS: Our case suggests that MT can be performed in a highly selective manner in patients with the occlusion of a posterior circulation branch, such as the AICA, and yield a good clinical outcome.

ID NEUROFIBROMATOSIS TYPE-1; CHIARI I; PATHOPHYSIOLOGY; PATIENT
AB BACKGROUND: Spinal meningocele is the herniation of dura mater and cerebrospinal fluid through a spinal defect, be it congenital, iatrogenic, or traumatic. Intrathoracic meningoceles are rare and are most commonly associated with neurofibromatosis. When indicated, surgical management of symptomatic thoracic meningocele is aimed at decreasing the size of the meningocele, which can be accomplished by a variety of procedures.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 59-year-old woman with neurofibromatosis type 1 and a known thoracic meningocele was initially managed conservatively. However, she developed syringomyelia and subsequently became symptomatic from the syrinx. She was ultimately treated successfully with ventriculoperitoneal shunt. Shunting resulted in complete resolution of the syrinx, while the thoracic meningocele remained stable in size.
   CONCLUSIONS: Ventriculoperitoneal shunt can be used to successfully treat a symptomatic syrinx in a patient with an asymptomatic thoracic meningocele. Alterations in normal cerebrospinal fluid flow dynamics from the thoracic meningocele likely contributed to the development of syringomyelia in this patient.

   CLASSIFICATION; MALFORMATIONS; EPIDEMIOLOGY; MUTATION
AB BACKGROUND: Type IIIb dysplasia is a subtype of focal cortical dysplasia associated with a tumor, most frequently with gangliogliomas then with dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumors (DNETs). Their preoperative diagnosis often remains equivocal since specific features are missing. The functional results (i.e., seizure free) is good with 81%-87% of Engel Ia at 5-year follow-up.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 4-year-old boy presented with a 1-year history of severe, invalidating, drug-resistant epilepsy. Imaging workup demonstrated a huge left limbic lesion, of which diagnosis remained speculative. Because of worsening neurological status, resective surgery was recommended after multidisciplinary discussion. The resection was performed through left transtemporal approach under neuronavigation (C.R.). Postoperative magnetic resonance imaging assessed uncomplicated near-total resection. Histopathological analysis showed combined features of a DNET of nonspecific type and a focal cortical dysplasia.
   CONCLUSION: We describe a rare condition of type IIIb dysplasia combining a focal cortical dysplasia with a DNET. Preoperative diagnosis of the lesion was of utmost difficultly, thereby rendering mandatory a thorough histopathological examination of resected specimen in the vast majority of cases. Increased recognition of the condition brings up the hypothesis of a genetic continuum or linkage between the 2 conditions. Functional results on seizure activity after ablative surgery are good and maximal safe resection should be the goal.

TI Endoscopic Third Ventriculostomy versus Ventriculoperitoneal Shunt in
   Patients with Obstructive Hydrocephalus: Meta-Analysis of Randomized
   Controlled Trials
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
LA English
DT Review
DE Endoscopic third ventriculostomy; Obstructive hydrocephalus;
   Ventriculoperitoneal shunt
ID HEMORRHAGE; TUMORS
AB OBJECTIVE: Endoscopic third ventriculostomy (ETV) and ventriculoperitoneal shunt (VPS) are 2 surgical methods used for the treatment of obstructive hydrocephalus. However, the efficacy and safety of these 2 procedures are unknown. Therefore we conducted a meta-analysis to compare the safety and efficiency of ETV and VPS in patients with obstructive hydrocephalus.
   METHODS: In January 2019, a comprehensive search strategy of 3 electronic databases was initiated. A systematic search from database inception to December 30, 2018, on clinical outcome, safety, and efficiency of ETV and VPS in the treatment of obstructive hydrocephalus was conducted. The following electronic databases were searched: PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library for related randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Main outcomes included postoperative hematoma, postoperative infection, postoperative cerebrospinal fluid leakage, blockage rate, and mortality.
   RESULTS: Of the 546 studies identified, 4 RCTs involving 250 patients met our inclusion criteria. The pooled results show that ETV was associated with lower incidence of postoperative infection (risk ratio [RR] 0.09, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.02-0.32, P = 0.0002); postoperative hematoma (RR 0.26, 95% CI: 0.08-0.88, P = 0.03); and blockage rate (RR 0.28, 95% CI: 0.13-0.60, P = 0.001) compared with VPS. Compared with VPS, ETV had no significant effect on incidence rate of postoperative cerebrospinal fluid leakage (RR 2.00, 95% CI: 0.30-13.16, P = 0.47) and mortality rates (RR 0.19, 95% CI: 0.03-1.09, P = 0.06), but there have been no deaths in patients treated with ETV.
   CONCLUSIONS: On the basis of the meta-analysis of RCTs evaluating ETV and VPS, the incidence of complications and mortality was higher with the VPS procedure, and therefore greater benefits can be achieved using ETV.

   Literature Review
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY

DT Review
DE Case report; Epidural; Spinal lipomatosis; Syringomyelia; Syrinx
AB BACKGROUND: We review 2 previously published cases of epidural lipomatosis associated with syringomyelia. We also present the case of a 42-year-old woman with a medullary syrinx from C1 to T3, initially only with upper limb paresthesias that presented after 10 years of follow-up for left hemiparesis and paresthesias in the tongue. Chiari malformation and cerebral or spinal space-occupying lesions were ruled out, as were other causes of syrinx except the presence of epidural lipomatosis extending from T1 to T12.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: Right laminotomies were performed from T1 to T12, removing excessive epidural fat tissue. After surgery the symptoms remained stable. At discharge the patient progressively recovered from the hemiparesis, and in follow-up magnetic resonance imaging the resolution of the syrinx was confirmed.
   CONCLUSIONS: This is the third case of a patient with a spinal syrinx and no other related causes except from spinal lipomatosis, although with only 3 cases it is not possible to completely state that lipomatosis caused the syrinx. Our case supports the trend established by the 2 previous cases. For treatment, initially patients should be managed conservatively, trying to correct the underlying etiologies of spinal lipomatosis. In case of failed conservative treatment, removal of adipose epidural excess in the most appropriate way is preferred.

ID LESIONS; TUMORS; MRI
AB BACKGROUND: Angiomatoid fibrous histiocytoma (AFH) is a rare low-grade malignant tumor mainly occurring in soft tissues, and its incidence in the bones is extremely rare. Although most of the existing reports focus on the pathological features of AFH, only a few describe its imaging features. To our knowledge, this is the first case of AFH in the skull, and it is distinguished from eosinophilic granuloma based on imaging results.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A boy aged 10 years presented with a painless mass of parietal bone after trauma. Cranial computed tomography angiography showed local bone defects near the sagittal suture of the left parietal bone and a soft tissue mass with relatively uniform density in the same area. The signals of this mass were heterogeneous in all sequences of magnetic resonance imaging and presented septal enhancement after the injection of contrast agent. The patient underwent complete resection of the mass, and the histopathological and immunohistochemical diagnosis of the mass was AFH. No complications occurred after the operation and no recurrence occurred during the follow-up.
   CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the first AFH that occured in the skull, and the main imaging manifestations of AFH are bone destruction with soft tissue mass. The characteristic features of AFH are its fibrillar component that showed low signal on T2-weighted imaging and septal or peripheral enhancement, and no dead bone in the mass.

   CELL; GENOTYPES; KIR
AB BACKGROUND: Infants and young children with neuroblastoma (NB) may present with metastases. The primary tumor most commonly originates in the abdomen and metastasizes to lymph nodes, liver, and bone marrow. Infants and young children presenting with multiple skull metastases are rare.
   METHODS: We present a rare case of a 20-month-old child who presented with metastatic neuroblastoma and multiple skull lesions. The child responded well to induction chemotherapy followed by myeloablative busulfan/melphalan consolidation.
   RESULTS: The child had substantial tumor reduction after chemotherapy was started. There was a significant decrease in tumor sizes and uptake, as seen in the metaiodobenzylguanidine study. The 6-month follow-up examination showed complete remission, and the remission continues.
   CONCLUSIONS: Infants and young children with neuroblastoma rarely present with metastatic lesions to the skull. Even large lesions involving the skull base may be successfully treated with chemotherapy. The use of myeloablative busulfan/melphalan consolidation after induction chemotherapy can decrease the overall metastatic tumor burden. Craniofacial specialists should be aware of treatment options for these young children.

ID ANTI-PD-1; ANTIBODY; SAFETY
AB BACKGROUND: Immune checkpoint inhibitors have revolutionized the treatment of many cancers, including melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer, and renal cell carcinoma. These therapeutics increase the activity of T cells against neoplastic cells, although the immune response generated also has the potential to target normal cells, resulting in immune related adverse events (irAEs). Most irAEs occur outside of the nervous system, but cases of limbic encephalitis, hypophysitis, optic neuritis, and pseudoprogression have been reported.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: Here, we present a case of an intracranial irAE after neoadjuvant stereotactic radiosurgery and craniotomy for resection of a left parietal lobe metastasis. The patient presented with headache, right-sided apraxia, and a pronator drift 2 weeks after surgery. Imaging findings were suggestive of an intracranial abscess. The lack of fever, normal white blood cell count, and benign clinical appearance in the setting of combination nivolumab and ipilimumab therapy argued in favor of an irAE, however. After initiation of dexamethasone, the neurologic deficits resolved and the magnetic resonance imaging of the brain normalized over 7 weeks.
   CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report of an acute surgical-site irAE after stereotactic radiosurgery and craniotomy in a patient receiving nivolumab and ipilimumab. These immune-mediated responses can be treated with corticosteroids and close observation.

ID FILLED INTRADURAL CYST
AB BACKGROUND: Intraspinal degenerative cysts in the cervical region are rare disorders that may cause myelopathy or radiculopathy. Most of the intraspinal degenerative cysts reported are extradural cysts. This case report includes the neuroimaging, intraoperative, pathologic, and postoperative findings obtained in a patient with a degenerative intradural cyst at the craniovertebral (CV) junction.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: We report a patient presenting with progressive spastic quadriparesis resulting from compressive myelopathy due to intradural degenerative cyst at the CV junction. Preoperative magnetic resonance imaging showed the intradural cyst at the cervicomedullary junction with degenerative changes causing myelopathy. We performed decompression of the CV junction, and histopathology of the cyst revealed degenerative cyst. Postoperatively the symptoms were relieved with no apparent complication. Intraspinal degenerative cysts causing compressive myelopathy are rare. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case of intradural degenerative cyst at the CV junction.
   CONCLUSIONS: In this case report, we demonstrated the clinical, imaging, intraoperative, and pathologic features of a degenerative intraspinal cyst at the CV junction that was intradural in location. Compression of the spinal cord resulted in a gradually progressive myelopathy that showed remarkable improvement immediately after decompression by cystectomy.

AB BACKGROUND: Severe kyphosis is infrequently seen in neonates with myelomeningoceles. Spinal skeletal dysmorphology complicates repair, as local tissue may be insufficient to cover the dural repair. Although neonatal kyphectomy has been proposed as a potential solution to this problem, it carries significant potential risks that may not be acceptable to families.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A neonate presented with a large myelomeningocele defect with associated severe lumbar kyphosis. Kyphectomy was both declined by the family owing to the potential surgical risks and deemed not appropriate by the surgeons based on the challenging anatomic considerations. Soft tissue closure was not possible with local tissue rearrangement. Acellular dermal matrix was used as a definitive soft tissue coverage option, with complete epithelialization noted at 8 weeks postoperatively.
   CONCLUSIONS: Acellular dermal matrix is a potentially useful adjunct for definitive reconstruction of complex neonatal soft tissue defects where local tissue is not available.

DE Cerebrospinal fluid; Communicating hydrocephalus; Demyelinating;
   Hydrocephalus; Neuromyelitis optica; Shunt
ID FLUID
AB BACKGROUND: Neuromyelitis optica is an autoimmune disorder of the central nervous system that predominantly affects the optic nerves and spinal cord. The neuropathologic hallmark of the disease is deposits of antibodies and complement, loss of astrocytes, secondary degeneration of oligodendrocytes and neurons, and necrotic lesions with infiltration of neutrophilic and eosinophilic granulocytes. It can rarely be associated with hydrocephalus, but the cause and mechanisms that result in hydrocephalus are not clear.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 35-year-old woman with a history of neuromyelitis optica presented with a 5-day history of progressively worsening lethargy, fatigue, somnolence, and headaches. Imaging demonstrated new hydrocephalus without evidence of obstruction, and extensive periventricular enhancement concerning for active demyelination. She underwent placement of a ventriculostomy, and subsequently underwent endoscopic biopsy and ventriculoperitoneal shunt placement. Pathology confirmed demyelination secondary to neuromyelitis optica.
   CONCLUSIONS: This case provides evidence of the rapid development of hydrocephalus in association with periventricular inflammation, without aqueductal stenosis. In a state of aquaporin-4 dysfunction such as in neuromyelitis optica, altered cerebrospinal fluid resorption could lead to acute hydrocephalus by a nonobstructive mechanism.

AB OBJECTIVE: In this study we aim to evaluate the feasibility of creating volumetric models of highly intricate skull-base anatomy-previously not amenable to volumetric reconstruction-using endoscopic endonasal approaches.
   METHODS: Ten human cadaveric heads were dissected through the nasal corridor to expose anterior, middle, and posterior cranial fossi structures and the pterygopalatine and infratemporal fossi. A rigid endoscope with a 30 degrees lens was used to capture the images. Subsequently, a photogrammetry software was used to align, smooth, and texturize the images into a complete 3-dimensional model.
   RESULTS: An average of 174 photographs were used to construct each model (n = 10). In the end, we achieved high-definition stereoscopic volumetric models of the nasal corridor; paranasal fossae; and anterior, middle and posterior fossae structures that preserved structural integrity. Strategic points of interests were labeled and animated for educational use.
   CONCLUSIONS: Endoscopic volumetric models represent a new way to depict the anatomy of the skull base; their use with 3-dimensional technologies could potentially improve the visuospatial understanding of narrow surgical corridors for education and surgical-planning purposes.

DE Back pain; Herniated disc; Lumbar; Minimally invasive spine surgery;
   Surgical technique; Syringes
ID SPINAL STENOSIS
AB BACKGROUND: The benefits of minimally invasive spine surgery are attainable only if hospitals have the financial resources to acquire essential equipment. We present a surgical approach readily available to countries where unacceptably expensive materials are the main limitation for use of minimally invasive spine surgery.
   METHODS: This retrospective study included 30 patients who underwent minimally invasive spine surgery using syringes as dilators and retractors for posterior lumbar approaches. Inclusion criteria were lumbar radicular/back pain, degenerative disc, spondylolysis, unilateral approach, and maximum of 2 affected spine levels. Demographic characteristics, affected radicular level, diagnosis, type and length of surgery, hospital length of stay, MacNab criteria, complications, and resumption of daily activities were analyzed.
   RESULTS: Of 30 patients, 17 (56.6%) presented with S1 radicular pain. Pain was mainly due to posterolateral hernia (70%; n = 21) requiring 1-level discectomy. In 6 patients (20%), discectomy and an interspinous process device were required. One patient (3.33%) underwent 2-level discectomy. All surgeries were performed using syringes as dilators and retractors. Maximum syringe diameter used was 2 cm (20-mL syringes) in 29 patients (96.6%) and 3 cm (60-mL syringe) in 1 patient. Average length of surgery was 1.5 hours, and average hospital stay was 1.8 days. Based on MacNab criteria, excellent, good, and fair outcomes were achieved in 25 patients (83%), 3 patients (10%), and 2 patients (6.7%). Complications were observed in 5 patients (16.7%).
   CONCLUSIONS: This is a safe and feasible technique with excellent results obtained at low cost and is becoming an attractive surgical option in developing countries.

AB Superficial siderosis of the central nervous system is a rare disease caused by repeated hemorrhages in the subarachnoid space. We describe surgical treatment of a case in which a tiny dural defect with fluid collection in the spinal canal was detected by intraoperative ultrasonography (US). After laminectomy, intraoperative US imaging confirmed epidural fluid collection around the ventral dural defect before incision of the posterior dura mater. Intraoperative US also showed a dural defect at the ventral and right side of the spinal cord. The ventral dural defect was repaired by direct sutures. After repair, intraoperative US imaging confirmed dural hole closure and resolution of the collected fluid. Intraoperative US is useful for detecting the level of dural defect before repair and confirming closure of the dural defect and successful resolution of fluid collection after repair.

   Pigmented villonodular synovitis; Spontaneous spinal epidural hematoma
ID ARTHROPATHY
AB BACKGROUND: Spontaneous spinal epidural hematoma (SSEH) is a spinal emergency that requires early diagnosis and decompression surgery. Here, we report a case of SSEH that was difficult to differentiate from pigmented villonodular synovitis (PVS) because of combined facet joint destruction and that required gross total resection, a procedure not typically indicated for SSEH.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 58-year-old woman complained of sudden-onset walk disturbance after backache without any traumatic episode. Physical examination revealed motor paralysis in the leg. Moreover, extensive destruction of the L4/5 right facet joint and an epidural mass continuing from the facet was observed. The epidural mass showed heterogeneous intensity in magnetic resonance imaging, suggesting different stages of bleeding. These hemorrhagic changes combined with the facet joint destruction suggested PVS, and preoperative and intraoperative pathologic examinations could not rule out PVS. After surgical treatment of PVS, the lesion in the articular process was resected and decompression was performed. The pathologic diagnosis was hematoma with bone necrosis in the articular process, without neoplastic finding suggesting PVS.
   CONCLUSIONS: SSEH could be combined with facet joint destruction composed of bone necrosis. Awareness of SSEH with facet joint destruction can facilitate early diagnosis and appropriate surgical treatment.

AB OBJECTIVE: Anterior lumbar interbody fusion (ALIF) is a common spinal fusion option for different spinal pathologies. In the early years, implant migrations/expulsions were potential complications of ALIFs due to the lack of integral fixation. We present a historical vignette on the inception and development of the first stand-alone ALIF (SA-ALIF) implant-the Hartshill Horseshoe (HH).
   METHODS: A Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses systematic search was carried out for 3 online databases focusing on implant development for ALIF, refining the search to before 1995. A personal communication with the original patent holders of the HH was used due to the lack of formal publication of the HH during its early years.
   RESULTS: Since 1932, the idea of anterior lumbar fusion was proposed and was carried out in 1933 using a tibial peg. Autografts were first reported in 1936 as interbody spacers for ALIF. Since then, bone grafts were commonly used for ALIF. However, ALIFs were not commonly performed due to variable reported outcomes. A pilot study in 1971 reported the use titanium mesh blocks as interbody implants in 6 patients. No articles reporting the use of integral fixation for SA-ALIF implants were found before the development of the HH in 1984.
   CONCLUSIONS: The HH was the first synthetic SA-ALIF implant developed. Since the HH, multiple SA-ALIF implants have been designed. The benefits of integral fixation in a SA-ALIF device include immediate implant stability, ability to reduce and correct deformity postimplantation, prevention of implant migration, and increased implantLbony endplate contact for early osseointegration.

AB Hydatid cyst is the larval form of the parasite Echinococcus. Echinococcus granulosus and less commonly Echinococcus multilocularis species cause the disease. Intracranial hydatid disease is relatively rare; the incidence is approximately 1%-2%. Intracranial hydatid cyst can be classified as primary and secondary. A primary cyst, the most common type, is always solitary. The treatment of hydatid cyst is surgical, and the aim of surgery is to remove the cyst without rupture to prevent recurrence or anaphylactic reaction. The Dowling technique (improved by Arana-Iniguez and San Julian) has been widely used for the excision. Albendazole and praziquantel are the medical treatment of choice. In recurrent cases or cases with rupture during surgery, medical therapy has been reported to be effective. Preoperative and postoperative albendazole may be considered to sterilize the cyst, decrease the chance of anaphylaxis, lower the tension in the cyst wall, and reduce the recurrence.

AB OBJECTIVE: To analyze the three-dimensional relationships of the operculoinsular compartments, using standard hemispheric and white matter fiber dissection and review the anatomy of association fibers related to the operculoinsular compartments of the Sylvian fissure and the main white matter tracts located deep into the insula. The secondary aim of this study was to improve the knowledge on this complex region to safely address tumor, vascular, and epilepsy lesions with an integrated perspective of the topographic and white matter fiber anatomy using 2D and 3D photographs.
   METHODS: Six cadaveric hemispheres were dissected. Two were fixed with formalin and the arteries were injected with red latex dye; the remaining four were prepared using the Kingler method and white fiber dissections were performed.
   RESULTS: The insula is located entirely inside the Sylvian fissure. The topographic hemispheric anatomy, Sylvian fissure, opercula, surrounding sulci and gyri, as well as the M2, M3, and M4 segments were identified. The anatomy of the insula, with the sulci and gyri and the limiting sulci, were also identified and described. The main white matter fiber tracts of the operculoinsular compartments of the Sylvian fissure as well as the main association and commissural fibers located deep in the insula were dissected and demonstrated.
   CONCLUSIONS: Complementing topographic anatomy with detailed study of white matter fibers and their integration can help the neurosurgeon to safely approach lesions in the insular region, improving postoperative results in the microsurgical treatment of aneurysmal lesions, insular tumors, or epilepsy surgery.

   the Cerebellum: Case Report and Literature Review
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY

DE Herpes encephalitis; Posterior fossa glioma; Spectroscopy
AB BACKGROUND: Herpes simplex encephalitis caused by herpes simplex has an estimated annual prevalence in the order of 1 in 250,000 to 500,000 patients and is considered to be the most usually encountered nonendemic pathogenic cause of lethal encephalitis in well-developed countries. There are a few cases reported in the literature in which a diagnostic dilemma between was raised between herpes simplex encephalitis and brain glioma and a definitive diagnosis was difficult to obtain.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: We report the case of a 5-year-old girl with a previous medical history of premature thelarche. As a part of her investigation, magnetic resonance imaging of the brain was performed, which revealed a space-occupying lesion of the posterior fossa. Magnetic resonance spectroscopy was performed, which advocated for the diagnosis of glioma. She was operated on, but the histopathologic analysis failed to verify the imaging findings. Herpes simplex virus (HSV) 1 was detected in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples. Follow-up magnetic resonance imaging scans illustrated the progression of the disease.
   CONCLUSIONS: The accumulation of data regarding CSF sample analysis, electroencephalography, brain biopsy, and imaging findings, along with the progression of the clinical picture of our patient, verified the diagnosis of HSV encephalitis. When confronted with confounding data that can pose a diagnostic dilemma between HSV encephalitis and glioma, brain biopsy and polymerase chain reaction of CSF samples could be able to verify the definitive diagnosis. When interpreting our results, we always have to consider the evolution of the clinical picture.

TI T-Configuration Horizontal Low-Profile Visualized Intraluminal Support
   (LVIS Jr) Device-Assisted Coiling for Treatment of Basilar Tip
   Aneurysms: A Technical Note
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
LA English
DT Article
DE Coil embolization; Endovascular; Intracranial aneurysm; Intracranial
   stent
ID MULTICENTER
AB BACKGROUND: Provided certain anatomic considerations, stent-assisted coiling of basilar apex aneurysms can be performed using a single stent placed in a horizontal T-configuration across the aneurysm neck prior to coil deployment, although this has predominantly been described using older-generation stents. The development of the Low-profile Visualized Intraluminal Support (LVIS Jr) device has provided greater versatility than previous stents, including use in smaller vessels, the ability to be resheathed, and improved flow diversion properties.
   METHODS: To our knowledge, we report the first use of the LVIS Jr device in a horizontal T-configuration across the aneurysm neck prior to coil deployment in 2 patients for the treatment of basilar apex aneurysms. This technique requires robust posterior communicating artery aneurysms and a second site of vascular access.
   RESULTS: Both patients demonstrated good outcomes following the procedure with no adverse sequelae. One patient required retreatment for recurrence after 1 year and was able to undergo further coiling without difficulty.
   CONCLUSIONS: Use of the LVIS Jr device allows greater versatility in horizontal T-configuration stent-assisted coil embolization, when compared with other available intracranial stents. This provides another tool to treat basilar apex aneurysms with improved coil occlusion and a theoretically decreased risk of thromboembolic events.

DT Article
DE Intramedullary hemorrhage; Myelopathy; Subarachnoid hemorrhage;

ID ENDOVASCULAR TREATMENT; EMBOLIZATION; MANAGEMENT
AB BACKGROUND: Hemorrhagic presentations are rare in vertebrovertebral arteriovenous fistula (VVAVF). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of a patient initially presenting with subarachnoid hemorrhage and progressing to intramedullary hemorrhage.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: The authors report on a 59-year-old man with VVAVF who developed massive intramedullary hemorrhage. Twelve months before ictus, the patient presented with subarachnoid hemorrhage. Although we recommended endovascular surgery, the patient refused treatment. Twelve months after the initial attack, the massive intramedullary hemorrhage in cervical spinal cord caused complete spinal cord injury. Emergent endovascular intervention was performed after the intramedullary hemorrhage, but there was no neurologic improvement.
   CONCLUSIONS: Identification of this phenomenon is important in VVAVF because intramedullary hemorrhage dramatically degrades patient outcome. Prompt surgical intervention is mandatory for VVAVF cases presenting with subarachnoid hemorrhage.

DT Article
DE Atlantoaxial instability; Basilar invagination; Trigeminal neuralgia
AB BACKGROUND: Trigeminal neuralgia can rarely be identified in association with basilar invagination. The presented case report observes that the treatment of basilar invagination by atlantoaxial fixation can result in lasting relief from trigeminal neuralgia.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: We report a case of a 36-year-old male patient who presented with the primary symptom of trigeminal neuralgia for a period of 2 years. Investigations revealed the presence of basilar invagination and an ectatic vertebral artery loop in the vicinity of the trigeminal nerve. The patient underwent atlantoaxial fixation on the basis of the concept that atlantoaxial instability is the nodal point of pathogenesis of basilar invagination. Atlantoaxial fixation resulted in complete and lasting relief from symptom of trigeminal neuralgia.
   CONCLUSIONS: The pathogenesis of trigeminal neuralgia and its relationship with atlantoaxial instability is speculated.

DT Article
DE Endoscopic; Isolated fourth ventricle; Suboccipital; Transaqueductal
ID AQUEDUCTAL STENT PLACEMENT; TRAPPED 4TH-VENTRICLE; AQUEDUCTOPLASTY;
   MANAGEMENT; COMPLICATIONS
AB BACKGROUND: Trapped or isolated fourth ventricle is a known, late sequela after lateral ventricular shunt placement for hydrocephalus, particularly after infection or hemorrhage. It may cause brainstem compression and insidiously present with ataxia, dysarthria, and intracranial hypertension, further delaying diagnosis. There is no universally agreed on treatment algorithm, and options include open fenestration through a suboccipital craniotomy, fourth ventricle shunting, and minimally invasive options including endoscopic stenting and fenestration through a precoronal approach.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: We describe a young child with epilepsy and symptomatic brainstem compression from a dilated fourth ventricle, with a history of streptococcal parietal abscess and posthemorrhagic hydrocephalus requiring shunt placement. Given his history of infection and nearly neurologically intact examination, we pursued minimally invasive endoscopy through a suboccipital, transaqueductal approach to fenestrate his fourth ventricle.
   CONCLUSIONS: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) demonstrated complex, loculated hydrocephalus and a dilated fourth ventricle. Under electromagnetic navigation, we endoscopically fenestrated his fourth ventricle using a rarely described suboccipital, transaqueductal approach. He tolerated the procedure without complication and improved neurologically, although his follow-up MRI demonstrated no change in fourth ventricular dilation at 1 year. Although there was no decrease in size of the fourth ventricle on follow-up MRI, we describe an alternative, well-tolerated, suboccipital approach for the management of a trapped fourth ventricle. Fenestration of a web of tissue in the aqueduct of Sylvius provided long-term clinical improvement and may provide a rescue approach for patients who are not candidates for standard approaches.

DT Review
DE Extracranial; Heart; Pediatric; Rhabdoid meningioma
ID PAPILLARY MENINGIOMA; CHILD; EXPRESSION; TUMORS
AB BACKGROUND: Meningiomas are the most common benign intracranial neoplasms in adults, but they have a lower incidence in children. Rhabdoid meningioma is a rare subtype of meningioma and is classified as World Health Organization grade III.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: We present a very rare case of a 9-year-old boy who presented to our institution with a history of headache, dizziness, and vomiting without neurologic deficit. The investigation showed a posterior fossa tumor with hemorrhage inside and hydrocephalus. He underwent tumor resection, and pathology showed rhabdoid meningioma. The patient had extensive recurrence after only 5 months, including extension to the neck, mediastinal veins, and heart. He was treated surgically and received adjuvant chemotherapy followed by radiation therapy.
   CONCLUSIONS: Rhabdoid meningioma is a malignant subtype of meningioma that occurs very rarely in pediatric patients. Additionally, rhabdoid meningioma, when it does occur in pediatric patients, has a high tendency to recur. Radical surgical resection with adjuvant radiotherapy is essential to prolonging survival. This is the first case with extracranial extension to the mediastinal veins and heart.

AB BACKGROUND: Women constitute a minority (9.2%) of academic neurosurgeons. We previously found that women in academic medicine are disadvantaged in funding and career advancement opportunities. We hypothesized that women are also underrepresented at neurosurgical society conferences.
   METHODS: Programs from the 2014-2018 meetings of the Congress of Neurological Surgeons (CNS), American Association of Neurological Surgery (AANS), and North American Skull Base Society (NASBS) were analyzed. Demographic data, including name, gender, and geographic region of practice, were collected for speaker, moderator, or leadership positions. chi(2) statistical analysis was performed for difference in gender representation across all opportunity spots.
   RESULTS: In the period 2014-2018, there was no female presidents or honored guest at any academic meetings analyzed; 53.8% of executive committees comprised all men. Women often constituted a minority (<15%) of speakers and moderators at CNS, AANS, and NASBS meetings: speakers (% female, range), 8.6 (5.5-11.7), 13.6 (10.1-19.7), and 10.5 (5.6-16.6); moderators (% female, range), 7.8 (0-14.3), 23.0 (81.3-91.3), and 13.0 (8.6-18.7). Conference panels frequently comprised all men (58% CNS, 20.7% AANS, 61% NASBS). chi(2) analysis found a disparity in male and female participation across all opportunity spots (P = 0.002). Additionally, female participants are often repeated, decreasing total number of unique women participating. There was no significant increase in female participation across the study period.
   CONCLUSIONS: In 2014-2018, underrepresentation of women in national neurosurgical conferences either matched or exceeded the baseline gender disparity seen in academic neurosurgery. We discussed potential causes of and strategies to address these findings.

AB BACKGROUND: Almost one half of currently practicing physicians in Europe are women. Despite advances in access to training positions and the entry of women into neurosurgery, it has remained a male-dominated field, with an underrepresentation of female leaders. We designed a 2-part study to better understand the current situation of European female neurosurgeons.
   METHODS: The European Association of Neurosurgical Societies and its member societies were analyzed for female participation in leadership positions. Additionally, an online survey was designed, containing 33 questions about career choice, mentorship, family planning, and perceived obstacles, for women in neurosurgery.
   RESULTS: A total of 116 responses were received. Most female neurosurgeons lacked same-gender role models (76%), although most reported that having a female mentor would be important (58%). An overwhelming majority (86%) believe family planning takes on a more important role for women, and 72% reported worrying their career prospects could be negatively affected by their desire to have children. The greatest obstacle perceived was the prevailing inequality in opportunities (30%) and attaining leadership positions (24%). Most (81%) reported that women have different concerns regarding their career from men, and 72% also reported feeling at a disadvantage as a woman. Most (66%) also believe should be a "Women in Neurosurgery" committee within the European Association of Neurosurgical Societies.
   CONCLUSIONS: Unfortunately, a gender gap still exists in European neurosurgery. The extent thereof has not yet been systematically analyzed. Our project offers a glimpse into the inequalities and obstacles women perceive in our field; however, more comprehensive data are required.

AB Arteriovenous malformations have a significant cumulative risk for hemorrhage. Treatment options include observation, microsurgical resection, stereotactic radiosurgery, embolization, and multimodal treatment. Treatment selection and timing are based on arteriovenous malformation (AVM) features including size, location in eloquent versus noneloquent parenchyma, pattern of venous drainage, surgical access, rupture status, and previous treatments. Spetzler-Martin grading is the most commonly used classification system used to select treatment, with grades I and II lesions amenable to surgical resection alone, grade III lesions typically treated via a multimodal approach entailing preoperative embolization followed by microsurgical resection, and grades IV and V lesions generally observed unless ruptured. Embolization in the treatment of AVMs is thus most commonly used as a preoperative or, occasionally, pre-radiosurgical adjunct. The concept of curative AVM embolization is an attractive one that has emerged within the past few decades, with increasing clinical evidence for its safety and efficacy in recent years. Obliteration rates for curative AVM embolization will be improved by innovation in endovascular techniques and technologies.

AB OBJECTIVE: Pediatric oculomotor nerve schwannomas are rare and challenging lesions due to the high morbidity associated with surgical intervention and their proximity to critical structures limiting the opportunity for stereotactic radiosurgery. We aim to report and review the novel use of fractionated Cyberknife (Accuray, Inc., Sunnyvale, California, USA) stereotactic radiotherapy in pediatric patients with oculomotor schwannomas.
   METHODS: A systematic review of PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane was performed according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. Two patients, ages 8 and 10 years, with tumor volumes of 0.1 cm(3) and 0.2 cm(3), respectively, were treated with fractionated Cyberknife radiotherapy at our institution. A total dose of 45-50 Gy was administered over 25 fractions (1.8-.0 Gy per fraction) to the 82%-84% isodose line. Serial magnetic resonance imaging was obtained for long-term follow-up (56e58 months).
   RESULTS: We found 14 articles published between 1982 and 2018 that reported a total of 18 pediatric patients with intracranial oculomotor schwannomas. No previously described cases of pediatric intracranial oculomotor schwannomas were treated with radiation therapy. In both of our patients, radiographic tumor control was achieved at a mean follow-up of 57 months, with 1 patient displaying a decrease in tumor volume. Neither patient exhibited any worsening of their presenting symptoms, nor did either patient develop any new neurocognitive deficits following treatment. -
   CONCLUSIONS: Fractionated Cyberknife radiotherapy is an effective and well-tolerated treatment option for intracranial oculomotor nerve schwannomas with excellent tumor control rates, similar to surgical and radiosurgical techniques, while sparing critical surrounding structures.

AB BACKGROUND: Convection-enhanced delivery (CED) overcomes the blood-brain barrier to deliver therapy within the central nervous system. Our aim was to evaluate citation and other bibliometric characteristics of the 100 most-cited articles about CED to the brain to better understand the state of research efforts in the field.
   METHODS: Elsevier's Scopus database was searched for the 100 most-cited articles that focused on CED to the brain. Articles were dichotomized as either primarily basic science (BSc) or clinical (CL) articles. Various bibliometric parameters were summarized, and BSc and CL articles were compared.
   RESULTS: Of the 100 most-cited articles, 64 (64%) were BSc and 36 (36%) were CL. The most common indications reported were brain tumors (59%) and Parkinson disease (5%). Overall median values were as follows: citation count, 102 (range, 70-933); citation rate per year, 9.0 (range, 3.7-49.4); number of authors, 5 (range, 1-25); and publication year, 2006 (range, 1994-2015). Articles were published in a total of 48 different journals, and predominately originated in the United States (n = 78, 78%). BSc and CL articles were statistically comparable in terms of bibliometric parameters.
   CONCLUSIONS: In the 100 most-cited articles about CED to the brain, there were more BSc articles compared with CL articles; however, they were comparable with respect to the reported bibliometric parameters. Given that the peak year of publication of these articles was more than a decade ago, we anticipate that the field will shift toward more CL articles once effective therapies to be delivered via CED are discovered.

AB BACKGROUND: Carotid body tumors (CBTs) are highly vascularized tumors which can render tumor resection surgery challenging. There is evidence suggesting that preoperative selective embolization can reduce blood loss during surgery and decrease the risk of perioperative complications; however, recent reports have questioned the benefits that preoperative embolization provides. The objective of this study is to investigate the impact of preoperative embolization on CBT surgical resection.
   METHODS: This study was performed according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. Eligible studies were identified through a search of PubMed, Scopus, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials until March 2019. A random effects model metaanalysis was conducted, and the I2 statistic was used to assess for heterogeneity.
   RESULTS: Twenty-five studies comprising 1326 patients were included. Patients who received preoperative embolization had statistically significant lower intraoperative blood loss (weighted mean difference [WMD], -135.32; 95% confidence interval [CI], -224.58 to -46.06; I-2 = 78.6%). Duration of the procedure was statistically significantly shorter in the preembolization group than the nonembolization group (WMD, -38.61; 95% CI, -65.61 to -L11.62; I-2 = 71.9%). There were no differences in the rates of cranial nerve (CN) injuries (odds ratio [OR], 1.13; 95% CI, 0.68-1.86; I-2 = 12.9%), stroke (OR, 1.75; 95% CI, 0.70-4.36; I-2 = 0%), transient ischemic attacks (TIAs) (OR, 0.55; 95% CI, 0.11-2.65; I-2 [0%), or length of stay (WMD, 0.32; 95% CI, -1.35 to 1.98; I-2 = 96.4%) between the 2 groups.
   CONCLUSIONS: Patients who received embolization prior to CBT resection had statistically significant lower blood loss and shorter duration of operation. The rates of CN palsy, stroke, TIA, and length of stay were similar between patients who had preoperative embolization and those who did not.

TI Methods and Devices for Posterior Ventriculoperitoneal Shunt Placement
   Surgery: 25 Years of Iterative Refinement
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
LA English
DT Article
DE Hydrocephalus; Normal-pressure hydrocephalus; Posterior shunt;
   Ventriculoperitoneal shunt
AB BACKGROUND: The posterior ventriculoperitoneal shunt (VPS) placement procedure is technically efficient and cosmetically appealing. The main limitations of the posterior approach relate to the technical challenges associated with accurately placing the ventricular catheter. In this report, we describe methods and simple devices used for posterior VPS surgery that have evolved over a >25-year period to enhance catheter placement accuracy and reduce complication rates.
   OBJECTIVE: We describe the combination of methods and customized devices used at a single institution to perform posterior VPS surgery. Results are presented for the most recent 11-year epoch, along with a description of sources of technical errors and plans for further methodologic refinements.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: The medical records and imaging studies of 468 patients undergoing posterior VPS, from 2007 to 2018 were reviewed. Ventricular catheter placement accuracy data were collected and complications were identified and recorded.
   RESULTS: Optimal ventricular catheter placement was achieved in 98.29%. Of the remaining 1.71%, one half (0.85%) required acute revision surgery. Four patients (0.85%) developed new neurologic deficits following surgery; 2 were related to intraparenchymal hemorrhages and 2 (0.43%) as a result of a misplaced catheter. The deficits resulting from poor catheter placement were transient. The complication rates due to causes other than catheter placement accuracy compared favorably with those reported previously in the literature.
   CONCLUSIONS: Using the methods and devices described in this series, posterior VPS operations can be performed safely with a high degree of ventricular catheter placement accuracy.

ID LAPAROSCOPIC TREATMENT; SPONDYLOLYSIS; ADOLESCENTS; DIAGNOSIS; CHILDREN;
   FISTULA
AB BACKGROUND: Anterior sacral meningocele (ASM) is characterized by a herniation of the dural sac through a bony defect of the anterior sacral wall. Symptoms of ASMs are usually directly related to their mass effect on the adjacent pelvic structures, often causing chronic constipation and urinary disturbances. The low-dysplastic spondylolisthesis results from congenital abnormalities of the upper sacral facets or the neural arch of L5. Its symptoms are related to neural compression and/or segmental instability. The main aim of this case report is to present a patient who underwent surgery for low dysplastic spondylolisthesis combined with an ASM that were both considered symptomatic.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 23-year-old male patient, with no medical history, no signs of neurologic deficit was admitted for lower back pain and irritation, numbness and paresthesia in the L5 dermatomes bilaterally, together with alternating constipation and diarrhea with no response to conservative treatment. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging of the lumbar spine and pelvis showing a large retroperitoneal mass with fluid contend causing compression and displacement of the pelvic structures, in particular the bladder and the colon and there was also a low-dysplastic spondylolisthesis of L5/S1 with pressure on both L5 nerve roots. Surgery was done in one session purely from a posterior approach with no complications.
   CONCLUSIONS: In the present case, we have demonstrated the suitability of a standard midline posterior approach in the treatment not only for ASM itself, but also for a low-dysplastic spondylolisthesis in 1 session.

ID SUBARACHNOID HEMORRHAGE
AB BACKGROUND: Spontaneous thrombosis of an intracranial aneurysm is rare but is common in fusiform or large cystic aneurysms, which result in subarachnoid hemorrhage after rupture. This case reports a 47-year-old woman with subarachnoid hemorrhage who developed spontaneous thrombosis of an aneurysm due to rupture of the posterior inferior cerebellar aneurysm.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: The patient was admitted to the hospital with history of sudden headache and vomiting for 3 days. According to early imaging findings, she was initially diagnosed as having a cavernous hemangioma with hemorrhage in the left cerebellum, but according to the intraoperative pictures and postoperative pathologic results, the diagnosis was an aneurysm with thrombosis. -
   CONCLUSIONS: This case represents a rare but important complication of ruptured intracranial aneurysm, which can be easily misdiagnosed or ignored. It should be given great attention and considered in patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage who are negative for imaging examinations.

ID VASCULARIZED FIBULAR GRAFTS; SPINAL TUMORS
AB BACKGROUND: Primary malignancies involving the mobile spine often require total en bloc spondylectomy with complex mechanical reconstruction, which can be augmented with novel application of the 3-dimensional (3D)printing technique.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 51-year-old man presented with a 12-month history of progressive thigh pain and lower limb motor function loss, 36 months after T12-L4 instrumentation and fusion for giant cell tumor (GCT) of the L2 vertebrae before referral. The patient subsequently underwent successful curative management of recurrent GCT through denosumab treatment, L1-L3 total en bloc spondylectomy (TES), and a novel lumbopelvic reconstruction method with a 3D-printed lumbar vertebrae and screw-rod system.
   CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of multilevel lumbar TES for GCT reconstructed using a 3D-printed vertebrae. Although TES-specifically in the lumbosacral spine-remains challenging due to its unique anatomy and increased risk of neurologic insult, it is an effective option for curative management of GCTs.

AB BACKGROUND: We analyzed the effect of specific optimization steps to reduce treatment delays in a nonacademic stroke hospital setting.
   METHODS: The data from patients with ischemic stroke who had been treated with intravenous tissue plasminogen activator or endovascular therapy, or both, were analyzed. The metrics were divided into 2 periods: preoptimization period (October 1, 2015 to September 30, 2016) and postoptimization period (October 1, 2016 to September 30, 2017). The key interventions were 1) notification by the emergency medical service to the emergency department and stroke team; 2) division of the stroke alert between level 1 (intravenous/intra-arterial candidate) and level 2; 3) direct transportation of level 1 patients to brain computed tomography; 4) limitation of nonessential interventions; 5) stroke orientation; 6) 24-hour, 7-day code stroke response by a vascular neurologist; 7) earlier notification of the interventional radiology team; 8) direct transportation from computed tomography to angiography suite for large vessel occlusion; and 9) multidisciplinary monthly meetings to discuss delayed cases.
   RESULTS: A total of 279 patients were identified. No significant differences in any of the baseline characteristics were documented. Almost all metrics favored the postoptimization period, with remarkable improvement in the door-to-puncture time (median, 64 minutes; interquartile range, 36-86; vs. 47 minutes; interquartile range, 20-62; P = 0.001). We observed an increased percentage of good clinical outcomes in the postoptimization group (60.1% vs. 54.8%; P = 0.500). We found an 8.4% increase in patients with good clinical outcomes in the postoptimization group compared with our previously reported work.
   CONCLUSIONS: For acute reperfusion therapies, significant reductions in workflow intervals can be achieved after simple optimization methods in a nonacademic community-based hospital.

   Hemorrhage: Analysis of Factors Influencing Clinical Presentation
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
LA English
DT Article
DE Cavernoma; Cavernous malformation; Clinical presentation; Seizure
ID NATURAL-HISTORY; BLEEDING RISK
AB BACKGROUND: Supratentorial cavernous malformations (CMs) can be epileptogenic lesions. However, little is known about clinical comorbidities, medication use, and radiologic features that predict a first seizure presentation without associated CM hemorrhage.
   METHODS: We queried a prospective registry of consecutive patients with CM established in January 2015. Data regarding clinical presentation, comorbid conditions, daily medication use, and radiologic CM characteristics were collected. Univariate and multivariate regression analysis was performed assessing variables for presentation with seizure without hemorrhage with P values, odds ratios, and 95% confidence intervals reported.
   RESULTS: Of 202 patients, 58.4% were women, and the average age at diagnosis was 43.7 +/- 16.5 years. Of the patients, 59.4% were symptomatic. In 40.6%, the CM was an incidental finding. Of the 30 patients who presented with a first-time seizure without concomitant hemorrhage, the mean age at diagnosis was 38.4 +/- 14.6 years, and 56.7% were women. Compared with incidental CM, patients with seizure without hemorrhage were younger, had a cortically based, supratentorial lesion, and were less likely to have chronic inflammatory disease or to use aspirin, vitamin D, or statin. Compared with other supratentorial lesions, patients with seizure without hemorrhage more commonly had a temporal lobe CM.
   CONCLUSIONS: These prospective data provide possible clues to radiologic factors, clinical comorbidities, and medication influences on seizure presentation in patients with CM. Further multicenter studies would be helpful to determine if disease-modifying agents in addition to epileptic medications or surgery might be helpful.

AB OBJECTIVE: First-line treatment for prolactin-producing pituitary adenomas is dopamine agonist (DA) therapy. This is the first study to analyze the rate of radiographic and hormonal regression of prolactinomas in response to DA therapy to better understand what time frame we consider DA treatment failure.
   METHODS: We searched the electronic medical records of 3 tertiary care medical institutions for patients with prolactinomas. The primary outcome was tumor volume and prolactin (PRL) levels at various time points. The secondary outcome was indicators of treatment failure. Modeling by both linear and exponential models was tested to determine potential predictors of response magnitude and treatment failure by multivariate and regression analyses respectively.
   RESULTS: There were 99 patients (53% male) included in this analysis. The mean patient age was 42.7 years +/- 14.5, and mean width/volume of tumor at diagnosis was 12.3 mm and 1.3 cm(3), respectively. The mean PRL level at diagnosis was 593.2 ng/mL (79-7913). Modeling indicated a plateau at 68.2% initial volume (95% confidence interval 61.7-73.5) by 12.6 months and a PRL plateau of 21.4 ng/mL (95% confidence interval 0-92.5) by 3.3 months. Multivariate analyses revealed male sex (odds ratio 0.168; P = 0.036) to be a predictor of faster PRL response to DA therapy.
   CONCLUSIONS: Prolactinomas plateau in PRL levels and the rate of size regression within the first year of DA treatment. Prolactinomas with lack of size regression and failure to reach normalization of PRL levels by 12 months may be considered for other management strategies.

AB BACKGROUND: Patients with cancer often present with brain metastases in the setting of controlled extracranial disease, for which they receive stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) and surgical resection. The role of systemic therapy after SRS is unclear. Brain metastasis indicates active cancer dissemination, and microscopic systemic disease may be present despite absence of gross disease as assessed by conventional imaging modalities.
   OBJECTIVE: The aim was to determine if post-SRS systemic therapy reduces the risk of brain relapse, systemic relapse, and death in patients with brain metastases and controlled extracranial disease.
   METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 67 patients with controlled extracranial disease who received SRS for brain metastases. Kaplan-Meier analysis and Cox proportional hazards regression were used to assess how post-SRS systemic therapy affected the risk of brain relapse, systemic relapse, and all-cause mortality.
   RESULTS: In our sample, 31% of patients received systemic therapy after SRS. Post-SRS systemic therapy did not affect median time to brain relapse (P = 0.43), systemic relapse (P = 0.16), or death (P = 0.33) by univariate analysis. After accounting for confounding factors such as cancer histology and age, post-SRS systemic therapy significantly reduced the risk of brain relapse (hazard ratio [HR], 0.22; P = 0.002) but not systemic relapse (HR, 0.38; P = 0.09) or all-cause mortality (HR, 2.16; P = 0.09).
   CONCLUSIONS: Only a minority of patients with brain metastases and controlled extracranial disease receive adjuvant systemic therapy after SRS, but those that do have a reduced risk of brain relapse. Post-SRS systemic therapy may act prophylactically to reduce the risk of intracranial cancer recurrence.

AB BACKGROUND: Stroke is a leading cause of mortality and disability worldwide. Research activity in Latin American countries might be the key to solving, or at least improving, the understanding of stroke-related issues in the region. Our aim was to describe and analyze the research output on stroke in Latin America.
   METHODS: We performed a bibliometric analysis of studies on stroke in Latin America reported from 2003 to 2017 in Scopus-indexed journals. We extracted the annual research, countries, journals, authors, institutions, citation frequency, and journal metrics. The data were quantitatively analyzed. Publication activity was adjusted to the countries by population size. Also, the results from an author and country co-occurrence analysis are presented as network visualization maps using VOSviewer.
   RESULTS: A total of 2298 Latin American stroke-related reports were identified, most were original research reports (72%). The number of reported studies had increased from 2003 to 2017 (P < 0.001). Brazil was the country with the greatest production with 1273 reports (55.4%), followed by Argentina and Mexico. No association was found between stroke prevalence and mortality and the scientific production of the country. Six universities and three hospitals were the most prolific institutions. A collaborative relationship was found between the United States and Brazil, Argentina, and Mexico. The intraregional collaboration of research on stroke was low among Latin American countries.
   CONCLUSIONS: Despite the continuous increase in research output from Latin American countries, more effort is needed to strengthen the research capacity by developing networks and collaborative research projects, ideally among the Latin American countries themselves.

AB BACKGROUND: Foraminal cervical nerve root compression can be caused by lateral disk herniation or osteophyte formation of the vertebrae. Improved diagnosis and evaluation can be achieved using different imaging techniques: radiographs, computed tomography (CT), and magnetic resonance imaging. We retrospectively evaluated the potential influence of a virtual reality (VR) visualization technique on surgery planning and evaluation of postoperative results in patients with monosegmental, unilateral osseous cervical neuroforaminal stenosis.
   METHODS: Seventy-three patients were included. Ventral decompression of the neuroforamen was performed in 41 patients, dorsal decompression in 32 patients. Patients' files were evaluated. CT scans were visualized via VR software to measure the smallest cross-sectional area of the intervertebral neuroforamen in the lateral resection region. A questionnaire evaluated the influence of VR technique on surgical planning and strategy.
   RESULTS: The VR-technique had a moderate influence on the choice of the approach (ventral or dorsal), a significant influence on the ventral approach strategy, and no influence on the positioning of the patient or the dorsal approach strategy. A significant difference was found in the size of the smallest cross-sectional area of the intervertebral neuroforamen in the lateral resection region between ventral and dorsal approaches, with no correlation to the clinical outcome.
   CONCLUSIONS: Reconstruction of pre- and post-operative 2D-CT images of the cervical spine into 3D images, and the spatial and anatomical reconstructions in VR models, can be helpful in planning surgical approaches and treatment strategies for patients with cervical foraminal stenoses, and for evaluation of their postoperative results.

TI Is Gross Total Resection Reasonable in Adults with Craniopharyngiomas
   with Hypothalamic Involvement?
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
LA English
DT Article
DE Body mass index; Endoscopic endonasal surgery; Hypothalamus; Pituitary;
   Subtotal resection
AB OBJECTIVE: The treatment of hypothalamus-invading craniopharyngiomas, based on pediatric experience, is subtotal resection (STR) with radiotherapy. This strategy sometimes leads to uncontrollable tumor progression. In adults, with the use of endoscopic endonasal surgery (EES), does removing the hypothalamic part of the tumor-whenever possible-compromise the outcome of the patients?
   METHODS: We included adults with craniopharyngioma treated by a first EES in 2008-2016 by senior neurosurgeon (E.J.). Endocrine, ophthalmologic, and hypothalamic data were retrospectively collected, including body mass index (BMI), cognitive and social status, with a systematic follow-up interview. Magnetic resonance imaging scans were graded according to Puget classification: 0, no hypothalamic involvement; 1, hypothalamic displacement; and 2, hypothalamic involvement. Grade 2 tumors were separated into gross total resection (GTR) or STR.
   RESULTS: We included 22 patients aged 18-79 years. Presenting symptoms were visual (14, 64%), endocrine dysfunction (10, 45%), BMI >30 (8, 36%), and cognitive/ psychiatric impairment (9, 41%). Fourteen (64%) were grade 2 craniopharyngiomas. GTR was performed in 14 (64%) patients. Postoperatively, 12/14 (86%) cases improved visually, and 20 (91%) needed hormone replacement therapy. There was no difference in BMI evolution in the GTR versus STR group, cognitive status was stable or improved in all patients except 1;4/8 patients with STR experienced progression needing adjuvant treatment versus no patient with GTR.
   CONCLUSIONS: EES GTR of grade 2 craniopharyngiomas does not cause major hypothalamic worsening, in contrast with children operated by cranial approaches. The surgeon's experience is key in deciding when to stop the dissection. Offering GTR whenever possible aims at avoiding tumor progression and radiotherapy.

ID TRANSCALLOSAL APPROACH; INSULA
AB OBJECTIVE: Through a cadaveric study, we divided the cerebral central core (CCC) into different areas and have proposed a corresponding neurosurgical approach for each sector. As a secondary objective, we analyzed the cortical and subcortical microsurgical anatomy of the CCC. The CCC includes the insula, extreme capsule, claustrum, external capsule, lenticular nucleus, internal capsule, caudate nucleus, and thalamus.
   METHODS: Twelve adult human brain hemispheres and one cadaveric head specimen were dissected and studied at the Laboratory of Neuroanatomic Microsurgical of the University of Buenos Aires. Nine cases of CCC neurosurgical pathologies were included in the present study and analyzed. Digital drawings were created of the approaches proposed for each sector of the CCC showing the most relevant surgical details. Photographs of each dissection and measurements obtained were taken.
   RESULTS: We divided the CCC into a medial, intermediate, and lateral sector, with specific subdivisions for the lateral and medial sectors. The lateral projection of the foramen of Monro was found deep to the third short gyri of the insula with the following distances: anterior insular limen margin, 23.95 mm; posterior insular limen margin, 22.92 mm; superior limiting sulcus, 14.99 mm, and inferior limiting sulcus, 13.76 mm. We have proposed the following approaches: an ipsilateral transcallosal approach, a contralateral transcallosal approach, a choroidal transfissure approach, a trans-splenial approach, transparietal access entering the intraparietal sulcus, and trans-sylvian approach. The preoperative imaging studies should be analyzed using our method to select the most accurate and safe approach.
   CONCLUSIONS: We have provided a description of the limits and anatomy of the CCC using brain dissection, an analysis of operated cases, and useful measurements for the neurosurgeon.

AB BACKGROUND: In pediatric cases, the use of autologous bone tissue to repair cranial bone defects is often impossible. The synthetic hydroxyapatite bone substitute (CustomBone) can be a good alternative, especially in case of a large bone defect that has to be repaired.
   METHODS: This study focuses on a pediatric series of 30 children who underwent cranioplasty with a CustomBone implant. Patient age ranged from 8 months to 16 years, with a mean age of 7 years and 8 months. The most common indication for cranioplasty was posttraumatic decompressive craniectomy.
   RESULTS: No complications were reported. Cosmetic results were satisfactory in every patient. Only 1 implant had to be changed after severe head trauma because of an epileptic seizure in the early postoperative period. In all patients, cerebral blood flow improved during the postoperative phase. Complete implant osteointegration is a long process because mean time to begin was 13 months (range, 3-22 months). Mean patient follow-up was 6.7 years. Successful prosthesis integration depends on the accuracy of the preoperative model. The minimum thickness of the implant (4 mm) represents a challenge in very young children, but we used it with success in this series. Moreover, high costs represent another limitation for its use.
   CONCLUSIONS: The CustomBone implant meets all necessary conditions for good clinical outcome: excellent protective properties, restoration of normal intracranial physiology, satisfactory cosmetic results, good integration in the autologous bone, and good resistance in case of trauma.

   MANAGEMENT
AB OBJECTIVE: Outcome in vestibular schwannoma (VS) surgery has improved enormously over the last decades. Surgical positioning remains a matter of discussion. A standardized protocol for diagnostics and management has been applied and evaluated for complications and functional outcome.
   METHODS: We examined 502 VS tumors in 483 patients (227 men and 256 women) between 2005 and 2016. According to our patient selection and treatment algorithm, 488 operations (97%) were performed in the semi-sitting position, and 14 (3%) were in the supine position. Auditory and facial functions were analyzed before and after surgery as were perioperative complications.
   RESULTS: There were 182 patients (36%) with small tumors (Hannover classification T1-T3A) and 320 (64%) large tumors (T3B or T4). Of the patients, 14% were neurofibromatosis type 2 cases. Complete tumor resection was achieved in 96.4%. Hearing preservation occurred in 44% of patients with small tumors and 23% of those with large tumors (Hannover classification), and correlated significantly with tumor size (P < 0.001). Facial palsy (House Brackmann grades II-VI) was present in 63 patients before and in 185 patients after surgery. Useful facial function (House Brackmann grades I-III) early after surgery was maintained in 86% of patients with small tumors and in 77% of patients with large tumors. Intraoperative complications included air embolism in 45 cases (9%), sinus injury in 3 cases, cerebrospinal fluid leakage in 46 cases (9%), and local hemorrhage in 19 cases (4%). Surgical revision was indicated in 31 cases (6%).
   CONCLUSIONS: In a standardized setting, the semi-sitting position allowed a safe approach. This setting offers the advantage of bimanual tumor nerve handling by the surgeon and an optimal visualization of important functional structures.

   RESECTION
AB BACKGROUND: Dumbbell-shaped spinal schwannomas with intradural and extradural components are associated with higher complication rates. This may be in part due to epineurial dissection of the extradural component, which inevitably damages the functioning nerve fibers beneath the epineurium and may lead to dural defects that are often difficult to repair.
   OBJECTIVE: The objective was to describe a radical intracapsular dissection technique that provides a simpler operative field with no need for dural repair and a better chance of preserving functioning nerve fibers.
   METHODS: The technique comprised the following: 1) exposure of the tumor while preserving spinal stability; 2) a single incision encompassing the dura and epineurium; 3) microsurgical dissection of the tumor just beneath the epineurium, preserving the viable nerve fibers; and 4) primary closure of the duroepineurial incision. We describe a case series of 7 patients in whom this type of tumor was excised using this technique.
   RESULTS: Gross total excision was achieved in 5 patients. In 1 patient with a large paravertebral component, the remaining tumor was removed with an additional anterior approach. No cerebrospinal fluid leak was noted, and no recurrence was observed in the median follow-up period of 36 months.
   CONCLUSIONS: The radical intracapsular dissection technique described herein represents an alternative technique for the removal of dumbbell-shaped spinal schwannomas with intradural and extradural components.

AB OBJECTIVE: Histologic types and grades are critical in the diagnosis and treatment of spinal tumors. Intraoperative frozen section is a fast and easy method in confirming pathologic diagnosis during the operation. This study was undertaken to reveal the accuracy of intra-operative frozen section biopsy in order to make proper treatment plans.
   METHODS: This retrospective study concerned patients who underwent spinal tumor surgeries from 1 January, 2012 to 31 December, 2016. Frozen section biopsy and permanent biopsy were compared, and cases that had differences were counted.
   RESULTS: Thirty-seven cases out of 324 patients had discrepancies (11.4%). In discrepant cases 11 cases were ependymoma (29.7%) and 6 cases were schwannoma (16.2%). Among 34 patients who were finally diagnosed with an ependymoma, 11 cases had discrepancies, which was the highest mismatch rate among tumor final pathologic types. By frozen biopsy, astrocytoma (n=5) and ependymoma (n=5) turned out to be the most discrepant pathologic types and 16 frozen section biopsy cases were "null." Frozen biopsy astrocytoma (n=5) mostly turned out to be ependymoma in 4 cases.
   CONCLUSIONS: Pathologic findings from frozen biopsy for spinal cord tumors could not be corresponded to final diagnosis, especially when the results of frozen biopsy were ependymoma or astrocytoma. Therefore careful decision making for treatment plans is required.

AB BACKGROUND: Several diseases that involve the optic canal or its contained structures may cause visual impairment. Several techniques have been developed to decompress the optic nerve.
   OBJECTIVE: To describe minimally invasive extradural anterior clinoidectomy (MiniEx) for optic nerve decompression, detail its surgical anatomy, present clinical cases, and established a proof of concept.
   METHODS: Anatomic dissections were performed in cadaver heads to show the surgical anatomy and to show stepwise the MiniEx approach. In addition, these surgical concepts were applied to decompress the optic nerve in 6 clinical cases.
   RESULTS: The MiniEx approach allowed the extradural anterior clinoidectomy and a nearly 270 degrees optic nerve decompression using the no-drill technique. In the MiniEx approach, the skin incision, dissection of the temporal muscle, and craniotomy were smaller and provided the same extent of exposure of the optic nerve, anterior clinoid process, and superior orbital fissure as that usually provided by standard techniques. All patients who underwent operation with this technique had improved visual status.
   CONCLUSIONS: The MiniEx approach is an excellent alternative to traditional approaches for extradural anterior clinoidectomy and optic nerve decompression. It may be used as a part of more complex surgery or as a single surgical procedure.

   OUTCOMES; QUALITY
AB OBJECTIVE: To compare outcomes of instrumented interbody fusion by the anterior approach (anterior lumbar interbody fusion [ALIF] with posterior pedicle screw fixation [PPF] or lateral lumbar interbody fusion [XLIF] with PPF) or the posterior approach (transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion [TLIF] or posterior lumbar interbody fusion [PLIF]) for spondylolisthesis through meta-analysis.
   METHODS: The MEDLINE via PubMed, Cochrane, Scopus, and Embase databases were searched for studies published between January 2010 and January 2019 evaluating outcomes including lumbar lordosis (LL), segmental lordosis (SL), slip rate, disc height (DH), back visual analogue scale (VAS), leg VAS, and Oswestry disability index (ODI) of ALIF with PPF or XLIF with PPF and TLIF or PLIF for spondylolisthesis. Two authors performed the data extraction independently. Any discrepancies were resolved by a consensus.
   RESULTS: Eight comparative studies were identified. There was no significant difference between the anterior approach and the posterior approach for preoperative LL, SL, and DH. In addition, postoperative back and leg VAS, and ODI between the 2 groups were not different. However, the anterior approach was more effective for restoration of postoperative LL, SL, and DH than the posterior approach.
   CONCLUSIONS: A literature review identified 8 comparative studies reporting outcomes of the anterior approach and the posterior approach in instrumented interbody fusion for spondylolisthesis. Despite heterogeneity, a limited meta-analysis showed that the postoperative restoration of LL, SL, and DH was better in the anterior approach group. Further large multicenter studies would be necessary to substantiate our results.

ID SUPERIOR OPHTHALMIC VEIN; INFERIOR PETROSAL SINUS; TRANSVENOUS
   EMBOLIZATION; FACIAL VEIN; ENDOVASCULAR TREATMENT; MANAGEMENT; PUNCTURE
AB BACKGROUND: The transvenous approach via the inferior petrosal sinus (IPS) is the most commonly used route to access cavernous sinus dural arteriovenous fistulas (CSDAVF). The facial (FV) or superficial temporal vein (STV) are alternatives in cases with IPS occlusion. However, navigation through the ophthalmic vein via FV or STV is difficult because of its specific anatomical features, such as abrupt angulations and tortuous course. Herein, we introduce a microwire looping method to overcome these obstacles, thus enabling access to cavernous sinus.
   METHODS: We initially tried to navigate a microcatheter through the vein using a conventionally shaped microguide-wire tip. If the traditional method failed, we made a single-or double-looped microguidewire. After anchoring the microguidewire, we pushed the microcatheter to add microcatheter tension and steered the microguidewire. Then, looping was formed and the looped microguidewire tip was easily passed through the abruptly angulated or tortuous vein.
   RESULTS: This looping technique was applied in 7 CSDAVFs (4 were through FV and 3 were through STV) that were unable to pass through IPS. In all cases, a total of 10 microcatheters (4 with single microcatheter and 3 with double microcatheters) successfully approached CSDAVF, achieving effective transvenous coil embolization. The clinical and radiologic outcomes were excellent in all patients. There was 1 postprocedural cranial nerve palsy without any morbidity or mortality.
   CONCLUSIONS: Making a microguidewire loop to pass through abruptly angulated or tortuous head and neck veins might be an effective and safe alternative for when catheterization is not feasible by the traditional method.

AB BACKGROUND: 3D printed models have grown in popularity for resident training. Currently there is a paucity of simulators specifically designed for advanced cervical instrumentation. Our institution created a unique simulator for the instruction of freehand placement of C2 laminar screws using a specific 3-dimensional printing technique to replicate the corticocancellous interface. This study was designed to determine the efficacy of the simulator for teaching neurosurgical residents the freehand technique of C2 laminar screw placement.
   METHODS: Ten participants with different experience levels participated in the study. The participants were separated into 2 groups based on experience level. Primary outcome assessments were breach rates, screw-screw interaction, and the ability to successfully place 2 screws in 1 model. Participants were graded based on a performance scoring system, and the outcomes of the 2 groups were compared.
   RESULTS: All participants in the novice group showed improved technical ability on repeated use of the simulator and were able to successfully place bilateral screws by the fourth attempt. Statistical analysis indicated an association between operative experience level and successful bilateral screw placement, implying that the simulator accurately represented an in vivo intraoperative scenario.
   CONCLUSIONS: By utilizing our novel 3D printing production method, we have created a unique simulator for the freehand placement of C2 laminar screws. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a study investigating the use of a 3-dimensional printed simulator specifically designed to teach the freehand placement of C2 laminar screws to neurosurgical trainees.

AB OBJECTIVE: Granular cell tumors (GCTs), pituicytomas, and spindle cell oncocytomas are rare, nonfunctioning pituitary tumors sharing positive staining of thyroid transcription factor 1. We present our series, the first single-institutional report with long-term surgical follow-up of all 3 tumor types.
   METHODS: Our institutional pathology database was queried for these 3 pathologic diagnoses. Clinical records were assessed for clinical presentation, preoperative and postoperative endocrine status, tumor location on imaging, surgical characteristics, pathology results, and tumor recurrence.
   RESULTS: Data were analyzed for 4 patients with GCTs, 4 with pituicytomas, and 3 with spindle cell oncocytomas. The most common symptoms at presentation were vision changes (64%), headache (55%), endocrine abnormalities (55%), and fatigue (46%). GCTs were the only subtype to present exclusively in the infundibulum and the only subtype in our series to be treated with a transcranial trans-sylvian approach to resection (n = 2). In our study, in contrast to other reports, estimated blood loss was less than 300 mL in all patients. Imaging confirmed gross total resection in all 11 cases with no known recurrences at a mean (standard deviation) follow-up of 4.7 (3.7) years.
   CONCLUSIONS: We present a single-institution series of rare thyroid transcription factor 1-staining posterior pituitary tumors of the sellar region. Key novel findings include gross total resection with no tumor recurrence at nearly 5 years of mean follow-up and no cases of excess or uncontrolled blood loss. Our findings reinforce the observation that GCTs present in the suprasellar space.

AB OBJECTIVE: The optimal management of dural closure is unclear; therefore, we aimed to survey current common practices among Italian practitioners.
   METHODS: The Delphi method was used to achieve a consensus on dura mater closing techniques in Italy. A steering committee decided 3 major topics to be investigated: pre- and postoperative conditions associated with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak, indications to perform watertight dural closure, and dural closure technique. A questionnaire containing 12 statements was then submitted to Italian neurosurgeons.
   RESULTS: The response rate was 60%. Among 60 items, 36 reached a positive consensus, 5 reached a negative consensus, and 19 did not reach consensus. Intrathecal hypertension, arachnoid opening, previous treatments, spinal incidental durotomy, wide size of osteo-dural defect, and lack of nasoseptal flap were considered major risk factors for CSF leak. Early mobilization, avoidance of stress maneuvers, and use of CSF external drainage were considered to reduce CSF leak rate. Italian neurosurgeons always attempt watertight dural closure, ideally with monofilament nonabsorbable sutures. Both autologous and heterologous dural grafts are used. Among dural sealants, fibrin glues are preferred, which are used most commonly in transsphenoidal surgery.
   CONCLUSIONS: This study elucidates the areas of consensus and uncertainty on dural closure management among a group of Italian neurosurgeons. It provides reliable and comparable data for the investigation of the departments' daily practice in dural closure. Given the lack of solid evidence, there is a need for further comparative studies of dural repair strategies.

AB BACKGROUND: Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) is a nonspecific inflammatory biomarker and has been reported to be useful in predicting community-acquired pneumonia and Mycoplasma pneumoniae pneumonia. The connection between LDH level and postoperative pneumonia (POP) in patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH) is still unclear. The aim of this study was to assess feasibility of predicting POP in patients with aSAH using LDH.
   METHODS: Admission serum LDH level was obtained in 647 patients with aSAH enrolled in a prospective observational study. The relationship between LDH level and POP was analyzed.
   RESULTS: POP occurred in 187 patients (28.90%). Patients with POP had significantly higher LDH levels than patients without POP (261.26 +/- 126.51 U/L vs. 189.00 +/- 69.20 U/L, P < 0.001). Multivariate analysis showed that LDH level remained a significant independent factor associated with POP in patients with aSAH, even after adjusting for possible confounding factors. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis showed that LDH level had a sensitivity of 63.6% and a specificity of 71.3% for predicting POP based on best threshold of 203.5 U/L. There were additive interactions between elevated LDH level and World Federation of Neurosurgical Societies grade or mechanical ventilator use. When patients were classified by World Federation of Neurosurgical Societies grade or mechanical ventilator use, regardless of World Federation of Neurosurgical Societies grade (<III or >= III) or length of mechanical ventilator use (0-24 hours or >= 24 hours), the POP-free rate of patients with admission LDH >= 250 U/L was significantly worse compared with patients with LDH <250 U/L.
   CONCLUSIONS: LDH might be a helpful predictor of POP occurrence in patients with aSAH.

AB BACKGROUND: Surgical indications for patients with pineal cysts are controversial. There are absolute indications such as hydrocephalus or tectal compression; otherwise, it is difficult to decide whether surgery would be beneficial when symptoms are not distinct.
   OBJECTIVE: We tried to clarify the indications and clinical course of patients after resection of pineal cysts without ventriculomegaly.
   METHODS: We reviewed our database for all patients operated on for pineal cyst without ventriculomegaly from 2003 to 2018. We studied the presenting symptoms, cyst size, surgical approach, extent of resection, and clinical and radiologic follow-up. Follow-up ranged from 3 months to 14 years (mean 3.74 years).
   RESULTS: Forty-three patients underwent surgery for pineal cyst in absence of ventriculomegaly; 36 female patients, 7 male patients, mean age 25.63 years (+/-10.62 years, range 4-52 years). Presenting symptoms included headache (41/43), nausea and vomiting (31/43), dizziness (19/43), visual disturbances (10/43), and sleep disturbances (8/43). Mean cyst size was 15.7 mm (+/-4.9 mm, range 9-27 mm). In total, 41 of 43 patients reported a good outcome, represented by a Chicago Chiari Outcome Scale score of 11 or greater and only 2 of 43 patients reported a bad outcome, defined by Chicago Chiari Outcome Scale score of 10 or less.
   CONCLUSIONS: We suggest that pineal cysts without ventriculomegaly are an indication for surgery when patients present with headache and/or visual disturbances and other causes have been excluded. Resolution of symptoms and quality of life in our cohort may denote a good indication for resection. However, we must admit that there is still no evidence to recommend this technique as a treatment of headache in these patients.

AB OBJECTIVE: Previous studies have identified the impact of affective disorders on preoperative and postoperative perception of pain. However, there is a scarcity of data identifying the impact of affective disorders on post-discharge narcotic refills. The aim of this study was to determine whether patients with affective disorders have more narcotic refills after complex spinal fusion for deformity correction.
   METHODS: The medical records of 121 adult (>= 18 years old) spine deformity patients undergoing elective, primary complex spinal fusion (>= 5 level) for deformity correction at a major academic institution from 2010 to 2015 were reviewed. Patient demographics, comorbidities, intra-operative and postoperative complication rates, baseline and postoperative patient-reported pain scores, ambulatory status, and narcotic refills were collected for each patient. The primary outcome was the rate of 6-week and 3-month narcotic refills.
   RESULTS: Of the 121 patients, 43 (35.5%) had a clinical diagnosis of anxiety or depression (affective disorder) (AD n = 43; No-AD n = 78). Preoperative narcotic use was significantly higher in the AD cohort (AD 65.9% vs. No-AD 37.7%, P = 0.0035). The AD cohort had significantly higher pain scores at baseline (AD 6.5 +/- 2.9 vs. No-AD 4.7 +/- 3.1, P = 0.004) and at the first postoperative pain score reported (AD 6.7 +/- 2.6 vs. No-AD 5.6 +/- 2.9, P = 0.049). However, there were no significant differences in narcotic refills at 6 weeks (AD 34.9% vs. No-AD 25.6%, P = 0.283) and 3 months (AD 23.8% vs. No-AD 17.4%, P = 0.411) after discharge between the cohorts.
   CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that whereas spinal deformity patients with affective disorders may have a higher baseline perception of pain and narcotic use, the impact of affective disorders on narcotic refills at 6 weeks and 3 months may be minimal after complex spinal fusion.

AB OBJECTIVE: Little is known about the effectiveness of lumbar drainage (LD) in the treatment of delayed or recurrent cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leaks. We report our institutional experience and the effectiveness of LD in the management of delayed or recurrent CSF leaks.
   METHODS: Between January 2014 and December 2018, a total 21 patients with delayed or recurrent CSF leaks were enrolled in the research. All patients were treated conservatively for 48 hours, and LD was prescribed if CSF leaks still existed after 48 hours. If LD failed, endoscopic endonasal surgery (EES) was performed as soon as possible. Medical records were collected to analyze the effectiveness of LD.
   RESULTS: Among 21 patients, 4 patients experienced resolution with conservative treatment, and 17 patients were treated by CSF diversion by LD. The total cure rate of LD was 9/17 (52.9%). The cure rate was not statistically significantly different (relative risk [3.33; Fisher exact test P = 0.131) between the traumatic group (8/12, 66.7%) and the transsphenoidal surgery group (1/5, 20.0%). During the follow-up time, no recurrence of CSF leaks was observed.
   CONCLUSIONS: The cure rate of LD in delayed or recurrent CSF leaks was lower than that of initial treatment with LD. The cure rate in the traumatic group tended to be higher than that in the transsphenoidal surgery group. EES can be used as a remedial treatment for patients in whom LD has failed.

ID SPINAL SURGERY; POSTOPERATIVE PAIN; MANAGEMENT; THERAPY; CARE
AB PURPOSE: The concept of enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) spread to different surgical specialties to minimize surgical stress response and to reduce length of hospital stay (LOS) and cost. Recently, several studies have reported experience with the ERAS program for spine surgery. The aim of this study is to introduce the establishment and implementation of the ERAS pathway for minimally invasive surgery (MIS) transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion (TLIF).
   METHODS: A multidisciplinary ERAS team was created to develop and implement a multimodal and evidence-based ERAS protocol for patients undergoing MIS-TLIF at a single spine center from January 2018. Fourty four cases in the ERAS group were compared with a historical cohort of 30 cases (from January 2017 to December 2017) who underwent MIS-TLIF before the pathway implementation (pre-ERAS group). We reviewed the compliance with ERAS components. The primary outcome was LOS. The secondary outcomes included 30-day readmission rate, 30-day reoperation rate, and financial cost. Perioperative factors and perioperative complications were also assessed.
   RESULTS: The protocol was composed of 11 ERAS components. The ERAS group showed high compliance with the ERAS program. The ERAS group manifested shorter LOS and lower cost compared with the the pre-ERAS group. There were no significant differences in complication rate, 30-day readmission and reoperation rates. Furthermore, the blood loss, operative time, intraoperative fluid infusion and postoperative drainage of the ERAS group decreased.
   CONCLUSIONS: Our ERAS program tailored for MIS-TLIF is able to reduce LOS and cost with minimal complications. The ERAS pathway expedites recovery in patients undergoing lumbar spine fusion.

TI Moyamoya-Related Stroke Risk During Pregnancy: An Evidence-Based
   Reappraisal

DE Delivery; Moyamoya; Postpartum; Pregnancy; Puerperium; Stroke
ID CLINICAL-FEATURES; VAGINAL DELIVERY; DISEASE; WOMEN; EXPERIENCE
AB BACKGROUND: Moyamoya is a rare, yet classic etiology of stroke in young adults, affecting predominately women of childbearing age. The impact of pregnancy on the natural history of symptomatic moyamoya remains a matter of extensive debate, however.
   METHODS: In October 2017, a MEDLINE search was performed using 14 keywords. A total of 12 original articles reporting on cohorts of at least 5 patients were retrieved and reviewed. Individual study data were extracted, pooled, and analyzed.
   RESULTS: A total of 736 pregnancies in 483 patients were included in our analysis. The mean age at delivery was 31 years, and the mean age at diagnosis (before pregnancy) was 22.6 years. Clinical presentation was ischemic stroke in 50.8%, hemorrhagic stroke in 45.9%, headaches in 2.1%, and ischemic-hemorrhagic stroke in 1.2%. After excluding patients first diagnosed during or after pregnancy (n = 283) and those who had been revascularized before pregnancy (n = 183), a total of 270 pregnancies in 188 patients were analyzed. During 224.6 patient-years of follow-up, 22 moyamoya-related neurologic events occurred (annual event rate 9.8%), more than two-thirds of which were transient (12 transient ischemic attacks and 3 seizures). Seven strokes occurred (6 hemorrhagic and 1 ischemic), yielding an annual stroke risk of 3.1%. As a result, 1 patient died and 2 were permanently disabled (annual death/disability rate 1.3%). All remaining patients experienced favorable functional outcomes.
   CONCLUSIONS: The risk of moyamoya-related stroke during pregnancy, delivery, and the postpartum period appears to be similar to or lower than that suggested by published natural history studies in symptomatic patients. A neuroprotective effect of pregnancy in moyamoya patients cannot be excluded.

AB OBJECTIVE: To investigate potential risk factors for cerebral hyperperfusion syndrome (CHS) after surgery in patients with moyamoya disease (MMD) using phase-contrast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).
   METHODS: The study included 84 adult patients (89 brain hemispheres) with MMD who underwent surgery. Preoperative phase-contrast MRI scans were performed for all patients. Peak velocity, average velocity, average flow, forward volume, and region of interest area of the bilateral internal and external carotid arteries, superficial temporal artery, and vertebral artery were calculated and analyzed. Patients were divided into CHS and non-CHS groups. Patients' age, sex, clinical symptoms, Suzuki stage, and MRI flow examination results were compared between the 2 groups.
   RESULTS: Nineteen of 84 patients (89 hemispheres) with MMD were in the CHS group. Patients with ischemic onset symptoms were more likely to develop CHS after surgery (P < 0.05). There were no significant differences in age, sex, and Suzuki stage between the 2 groups. For surgery ipsilateral vessels, peak velocity, average flow and forward volume of superficial temporal artery and average flow of external carotid artery and region of interest area of internal carotid artery in the CHS group were significantly lower compared with the non-CHS group (P < 0.05). For surgery contralateral vessels, forward volume of superficial temporal artery and external carotid artery in the CHS group was significantly lower compared with the non-CHS group (P < 0.05).
   CONCLUSIONS: Patients with MMD and ischemic onset symptoms are more likely to develop CHS after surgery. Preoperative phase-contrast MRI analysis may be helpful to predict CHS in patients with MMD after surgery.

AB OBJECTIVE: Clinoidal meningiomas present specific characteristics related to their peculiar site of anatomic origin. Clinical series focusing on pure clinoidal meningiomas are not numerous. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis, including our own case series, of the available literature to better identify the specific features of these tumors.
   METHODS: A systematic review and meta-analysis were performed for surgically treated pure clinoidal meningiomas using PubMed, Cochrane, and Embase databases. A retrospective review of a cohort of 18 consecutive patients treated between 2010 and 2018 in our department was also included in this meta-analysis.
   RESULTS: A total of 1208 patients were included in the analysis. With a weighted mean follow-up of 48.1 months, the pooled rate of gross total resection was 64.2% (95% confidence interval [CI], 57.3%-71.0%) in the overall population, 11.8% (95% CI, 2.4%-21.1%) in the Al-Mefty I subgroup, 92.6% (95% CI, 88.9%-96.3%) in the Al-Mefty II subgroup, and 84.2% (95% CI, 70.8%-97.6%) in the Al-Mefty III subgroup. Overall visual improvement after treatment was found in 48% (95% CI, 38.6%-57.4%) of patients with a pooled deterioration rate of 4.5% (95% CI, 3%-6%). Pooled overall recurrence was observed in 8.9% of patients (95% CI, 6.0%-11.8%) and mortality occurred in 1.2% (95% CI, 0.6%-1.8%).
   CONCLUSIONS: The rate of gross total resection is proportional to the dural origin of these tumors, which is intimately related to critical neurovascular structures. Complementary radiosurgery could represent a valid treatment strategy. Postoperative visual improvement remains less satisfying compared with other suprasellar meningiomas. The introduction of skull-base techniques, such as extradural anterior clinoidectomy, has enabled improvements in visual outcome without any increase in approach-related morbidity.

AB BACKGROUND: Idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (iNPH) is one of the very few treatable types of dementia. Shunt therapy has been shown to be effective in improving symptoms. However, the long-term results of cerebrospinal fluid diversion are variable. The aim of this retrospective study was to investigate long-term outcomes of patients with idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus treated with ventriculoperitoneal shunt by using programmable valves.
   METHODS: Symptoms before treatment were recorded. Clinical symptoms and outcome after ventriculoperitoneal shunt were assessed based on changes in gait, urinary incontinence, and cognitive dysfunction at yearly follow-up spanning at least 10 years.
   RESULTS: Among 50 patients treated, 5 had died at the time of the evaluation. Median age was 71 years, and mean follow-up time of the surviving patients was 120.2 +/- 2.3 years. Overall, there was a significant and lasting improvement among all symptoms compared with the baseline (P < 0.05). Gait showed better and sustained improvement compared with the baseline (P < 0.05). Cognitive impairment and urinary incontinence improved in the early follow-up (P < 0.05) followed by declines in long-term follow-up. Ten patients (20%) required surgical revisions for shunt malfunction. Change in valve pressure was performed in 20 patients (40%). Overall, 93.3% revisions resulted in clinical improvement.
   CONCLUSIONS: Surgical treatment for idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus by ventriculoperitoneal shunt is a safe modality that improves symptoms in most patients, including in the long-term. Strict follow-up is necessary for early diagnosis of shunt malfunction or need for valve adjustment.

AB BACKGROUND: The aim of this study is to share our experiences on a series of 21 patients with intraventricular meningiomas (IVMs). Histopathologic examinations are reviewed in detail and the cell of origin of IVMs is discussed.
   METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 1372 patients with intracranial meningioma who were surgically treated between September 1986 and July 2018. From this cohort, 21 patients with IVM were identified. The clinical, radiologic, surgical, and follow-up records were analyzed. The archival pathologic specimens were reviewed. Tissue microarray blocks were performed from the formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded samples of all IVM cases, 2 choroid plexus tissue adjacent to the tumors, and 10 extraventricular fibrous meningioma cases selected as control randomly. Immunohistochemical staining with the antibodies S-100, SOX10, NGFR, and OTX2 was performed according to the protocols indicated by the manufacturers.
   RESULTS: Surgical complications included hemiparesis in 1 patient (5%), postoperative seizure in 1 patient (5%), sensorial aphasia in 1 patient (5%), and preexisting headache in 1 patient (5%). Seventeen (81%) of the IVMs had grade I pathology and 4 (19%) had grade II pathology. The immunoprofile of IVMs is identical to the immunoprofile of normal choroid plexus epithelium.
   CONCLUSIONS: Transcortical approaches using intra-operative ultrasonography and intraoperative monitoring with avoidance of eloquent cortical areas can achieve good outcomes. Resection of the choroidal attachments should be attempted. Our results indicate that IVMs do not show arachnoid cap cell phenotype and the findings support that IVMs originate from the choroid plexus epithelium or the progenitors of the choroid plexus epithelium.

DE Giant schwannoma; Pelvis; Sacrum; Schwannoma
ID INVASIVE SPINAL SCHWANNOMA; CLINICAL-FEATURES; RESECTION
AB OBJECTIVE: Giant sacral schwannomas are rare and difficult to treat. Unexpected neurologic deficits after surgery and tumor recurrence should be considered when surgery is performed. We attempt to remove the tumors via piecemeal total or subtotal excision, leaving parts of the capsule adjacent to nerves to preserve the nerves. This study aimed to present the cases of giant sacral schwannoma at our institutions as well as review the relevant literature and to discuss surgical management.
   METHODS: This study included 11 patients (5 male and 6 female, mean age 53 years) with giant sacral schwannoma who were treated surgically. The clinical features, surgical details, and outcomes were investigated retrospectively.
   RESULTS: The tumors were intraosseous type in 4 cases, dumb-bell type in 3 cases, and retroperitoneal type in 4 cases. The surgeries were performed by a combined anterior and posterior approach in 4 cases, a posterior approach in 4 cases, and an anterior approach in 3 cases. The tumors were removed via piecemeal total or subtotal excision in 7 cases, partial excision in 3 cases, and enucleation in 1 case. After surgery, symptoms improved in all cases. The tumor recurred in 2 patients after partial excision. No patients receiving piecemeal total or subtotal excision showed recurrence. One patient developed motor weakness after piecemeal subtotal excision, but the symptoms resolved.
   CONCLUSIONS: Adopting an appropriate surgical approach based on the location of the tumor is important. Piecemeal total or subtotal excision, with parts of the capsule adjacent to nerves left behind may help achieve a good outcome, avoiding a postoperative neurologic deficit.

ID STROKE TREATMENT; RISK-FACTORS; CHINA; MORTALITY; FEMALE; CARE
AB BACKGROUND: Results are conflicting as to whether sex has an impact on the outcome of intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), especially when etiologies differ. In this study, we investigated whether sex differences exist in patients with vascular abnormality-related ICH.
   METHODS: Patients (age >= 18 years) diagnosed with ICH within 7 days of symptom onset were admitted consecutively between January 2012 and February 2014 from 50 hospitals across mainland China. Vascular abnormality related to ICH included aneurysm, arteriovenous malformation, moyamoya disease, and cavernous malformation. The outcomes were death and death/disability at 3 months. Disability was defined as modified Rankin Scale score >2. Multivariable logistic regression was used to estimate the association between sex and outcome.
   RESULTS: Women accounted for 41.9% (170) of the 406 patients, and they tended to be older than the men (women: 43.5 +/- 19.3 years; men: 40.0 +/- 17.7 years; P = 0.056). The proportions of ICH-related vascular abnormalities were as follows: aneurysm, 32% (130/406); arteriovenous malformation, 50.3% (204/406); moyamoya disease, 11.3% (46/406); and cavernous malformation, 6.4% (26/406). After we adjusted for age, National Institute of Health Stroke Scale, Glasgow Coma Scale score, location of hemorrhage, and surgery, female sex remained an independent predictor of death/disability at 3 months (odd ratio 2.49, 95% confidence interval 1.31-4.75), but not for death alone (odd ratio 1.45, 95% confidence interval 0.58-3.61).
   CONCLUSIONS: In our study, female sex was an independent risk factor for poor outcomes in patients with vascular abnormality-related ICH. The factors contributing to this sex difference should be investigated in the future.

AB OBJECTIVE: The pterional approach (PA) has been used to remove cranio-orbital lesions that have communicated via the supraorbital fissure (SOF). The supraorbital eyebrow approach (SEA) has become increasingly popular as a minimally invasive approach. However, few reports have examined the SEA for cranio-orbital lesions. We assessed the relative advantages, disadvantages, and selection criteria for these 2 approaches.
   METHODS: The data from all consecutive patients who had undergone removal of a cranio-orbital lesion that communicated via the SOF using the PA or SEA were analyzed.
   RESULTS: Of the 25 patients, 13 had undergone surgical resection using the SEA and 12 had undergone resection using the PA. The SEA provided better cosmetic satisfaction, resulted in a shorter surgical time, and required a shorter incision (P < 0.05). Proptosis had improved significantly in all the patients. No significant differences were found in the total resection rates, visual outcomes, recovery of ptosis, or other new surgically related complications between the 2 groups (P > 0.05). All the patients were followed up for an average of 21.9 months. One patient in each group had developed recurrence or progression that required radiotherapy. The disease of the other patients with subtotal resection was stable or atrophic.
   CONCLUSION: The SEA provided better cosmetic satisfaction, resulted in a shorter surgical time, and required a shorter incision. The SEA might be a more minimally invasive option for lesions communicating via the SOF without obvious hyperostosis. The PA might be more reasonable for lesions with obvious hyperostosis and more extensive lesions in the cavernous sinus.

TI Mercury vs. Water: An Analysis of Multi-Institutional Survey Data
   Assessing Intracranial Pressure Unit of Measure Awareness
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
LA English
DT Article
DE Intracranial pressure; Measures; Neurological surgery
ID MANAGEMENT
AB BACKGROUND: Intracranial pressure (ICP) reporting impacts neurosurgical care. Millimeters of mercury (mmHg) and centimeters of water (cmH(2)O) are both used to report ICP in clinical practice and the literature. In this study, we investigated ICP unit of measure awareness in the neurosurgical community.
   METHODS: A survey was conducted at four US academic neurosurgery departments asking the following questions: What is your threshold for a concerning ICP? How many minutes is that ICP sustained for you to be concerned? What unit are you implying when you state that ICP? What unit of measure is an ICP reported on the monitor when transduced? When setting an external ventricular drain Becker bag level, what unit of measure do you set it to? Do you ever manually check an ICP based on a column of cerebrospinal fluid? How many cmH(2)O is 20 mmHg?
   RESULTS: An ICP of 20 and sustained for five minutes were the two most common answers. Some 71% of residents and 34% of attendings reported using cmH(2)O as the unit of measure; 18% of residents and 24% of attendings implied different units when discussing ICP than the unit they thought was transduced; and 53% of residents and 34% of attendings did not know the transduced ICP unit of measure reported in their intensive care unit.
   CONCLUSIONS: Variability and discrepancies regarding the ICP unit of measure exist in academic neurosurgery departments. Clinicians should familiarize themselves with their hospital's practices. Institutions and all of medicine may consider standardizing the ICP unit of measure, using mmHg as a universal nomenclature.

AB BACKGROUND: Experiencing cranial surgery under awake conditions may expose patients to considerable psychological strain.
   METHODS: This study aimed to investigate the occurrence and course of psychological sequelae following awake craniotomy (AC) for brain tumors in a series of 20 patients using a broad, validated psychological assessment preoperatively, intraoperatively, postoperatively and a standardized follow-up of 3 months. In addition, the association of the preoperative psychological condition (including, but not limited to, anxiety and fear) with peri-operative pain perception and interference was assessed.
   RESULTS: AC did not induce any shift in the median levels of anxiety, depression, and stress symptoms already present prior to the procedure. Furthermore, anxiety and depression were all moderately to strongly associated over time (all P < 0.05). Stress symptoms also correlated positively over all times of measurement. Stress 3 days after surgery was strongly associated with stress 3 months after surgery (P < 0.001), whereas the correlation between preoperative and immediate postoperative stress showed a statistical trend (P = 0.07). Preoperative fear was not related to intraoperative pain, but to pain and its interference with daily activity on the third postoperative day (P < 0.001 and P < 0.01, respectively).
   CONCLUSIONS: Postoperative psychological symptoms clearly correlated with their corresponding preoperative symptoms. Thus, mental health was not negatively affected by the AC experience in our series. Intraoperative fear and pain were not related to the preoperative psychological condition. However, preoperative fear and anxiety were positively related with pain and its interference with daily activity in the immediate postoperative period.

AB OBJECTIVE: In thoracolumbar (TL) burst fractures, vertebral body height loss (VBHL) indicates the degree of instability and constitutes one of the decision criteria for surgical treatment. However, the relative reliability and variability of different measurement techniques for VBHL are unknown. We compared the reliability of different methods used to assess VBHL.
   METHODS: A total of 144 patients with TL burst fractures were included, and lateral radiographs were taken twice at an interval of 2 weeks, which were examined by 3 observers. The measurement methods used included the anterior/posterior vertebral body height compression ratio (APCR), anterior height compression percentage (AHCP), and anterior/posterior vertebral body height compression ratio percentage. To compare the accuracy of measurements according to vertebral degeneration, subjects were divided into 2 groups based on the median age of 50 years.
   RESULTS: In intraobserver comparisons, the APCR method showed a higher inter-and intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) (>0.714) compared with the other methods. In interobserver comparisons, the ICC of the APCR (>0.793) was excellent. In intraobserver comparisons of the aged >50-years group, only the APCR method showed an excellent ICC (>0.753), whereas the AHCP method showed a fair to good ICC, and the anterior/posterior vertebral body height compression ratio percentage method had the lowest ICC. In interobserver comparisons of the aged >50-years group, the APCR and AHCP methods showed excellent ICCs. In the aged <= 50-years group, all 3 methods showed similar fair to good ICC values.
   CONCLUSIONS: Based on comparative reliability analyses, we recommend the APCR method as the first-line technique and the AHCP as an alternative technique for measuring VBHL in TL burst fractures.

AB OBJECTIVES: The pallidothalamic tract connects the globus pallidus internus with the ventroanterior and ventrolateral parts of the thalamus. Lesioning or stimulation of the pallidothalamic tract has ameliorating effects on dyskinesia and dystonia in patients with Parkinson disease. However, the effect of the procedure on dystonia due to other etiologies has not been reported.
   METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed patients with dystonia who underwent unilateral pallidothalamic tractotomy between July 2017 and October 2018 at Tokyo Women's Medical University Hospital. The Burke-Fahn-Marsden Dystonia Rating Scale-Movement Scale was used to evaluate the severity of dystonia at three time points (before surgery, 3 months postoperatively, and the last available follow-up). Adverse events were also evaluated.
   RESULTS: Eleven patients underwent unilateral pallidothalamic tractotomy, including 5 with generalized dystonia, 4 with segmental dystonia, and 2 with focal (cervical) dystonia. All patients had undergone unilateral pallidotomy before contralateral pallidothalamic tractotomy. The mean interval between the previous surgery (pallidotomy) and pallidothalamic tractotomy was 9.5 +/- 3.1 months. The mean follow-up period was 11.5 +/- 4.2 months. The Burke-Fahn-Marsden Dystonia Rating Scale-Movement Scale scores at 3 months after pallidothalamic tractotomy (5.8 +/- 8.4) and at the last available follow-up (5.6 +/- 8.3, P < 0.001) were significantly improved compared with that before pallidothalamic tractotomy (21.8 +/- 16.3). The most common adverse event was reduced voice volume (6 patients), which was mild and did not interfere with the patient's daily activities.
   CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that pallidothalamic tractotomy can be an alternative treatment target for dystonia. A larger and longer prospective study is needed to elucidate the safety and efficacy of pallidothalamic tractotomy for dystonia.

AB OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the 30-day outcomes of using the Enterprise stent to treat patients with hypoperfusion of symptomatic severe intracranial stenosis.
   METHODS: Patients with symptomatic severe intracranial stenosis (70%-99%) who underwent Enterprise stent intervention between August 2014 and November 2018 were retrospectively analyzed. The 30-day primary outcomes included the success rate of stenting and the incidence of complications, including ischemic stroke, cerebral hemorrhage, and death. The 30-day complication rates of patients with different lesion locations and classifications of Mori morphology were compared.
   RESULTS: Sixty-eight patients were treated using 70 Enterprise stents. The success rate was 100%. The 30-day complication rate was 4.4%. The rates of ischemic stroke, cerebral hemorrhage, and death were 1.5%, 2.9%, and 0%, respectively. No significant difference was found in the 30-day complication rate between patients with different lesion locations and classifications of Mori morphology (P > 0.05).
   CONCLUSION: Enterprise stents were relatively safe in treating patients with hypoperfusion of symptomatic severe intracranial stenosis.

AB OBJECTIVE: To investigate the association between vascular morphology and the development of intracranial aneurysms (IAs), the morphological changes of intracranial arteries after IA induction were examined using a rodent model.
   METHODS: The vascular morphology of the circle of Willis in rats was visualized at 1 week and at 3 months after IA induction using 7-T magnetic resonance imaging. The following 2 angle parameters were defined: the angle between the parent artery and the daughter arteries (PD angle), and the widening of the daughter arteries (DD angle). The correlations of the angle parameters with IA size and with the number of macrophages infiltrated in the IA wall by immunohistochemistry were examined.
   RESULTS: Magnetic resonance imaging showed bending of the arteries over time around the predilection site for IAs. The PD angle increased significantly 1 week after IA induction (P < 0.05) and correlated with IA size (P < 0.01). The DD angle did not increase after 1 week, but increased 3 months after IA induction (P < 0.01). The PD angle 1 week after surgery also correlated with the number of infiltrated macrophages in aneurysmal walls (P = 0.01).
   CONCLUSIONS: Sequential inward bending of arterial bifurcations occurred after IA induction in the rat model. The degree of arterial bending correlated with IA development and inflammation in the IA wall, suggesting that the vascular morphology may be strongly associated with IA development through a proinflammatory mechanism.

ID BLUNT CEREBROVASCULAR INJURIES; 10-YEAR RETROSPECTIVE ANALYSIS;
   THROMBOSIS
AB BACKGROUND: Vertebral artery injuries (VAIs) caused by cervical trauma include irregularities with narrowing of the arterial wall, dissection, pseudoaneurysm formation, occlusion, and transection. Although recent guidelines have recommended anticoagulant or antiplatelet therapy to prevent subsequent stroke in patients with traumatic VAIs, regardless of the type of vascular injury, the clinical role of endovascular surgery in the treatment of traumatic VAIs remains to be elucidated.
   METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated the treatment outcomes of 23 patients with cervical fracture and vertebral artery occlusion (VAO) who had required cervical surgery in the acute stage.
   RESULTS: No patient received antiplatelet or anticoagulant therapy, because the VAs had already become occluded. After cervical surgery, 5 of the 23 patients developed radiologically confirmed thromboembolic stroke after cervical surgery. None of these 5 patients with postoperative infarction had undergone preoperative VA embolization. Univariate analysis revealed that only the implementation of preoperative VA embolization was associated with the prevention of postoperative infarction (P = 0.004). Factors such as age, reduction, level of VAO, and diabetes mellitus did not correlate with increased risk.
   CONCLUSIONS: The clinical role of endovascular surgery for traumatic VAI has not been previously established; however, a more specific selection of patients according to the VAI type might be necessary. Our data have indicated that preoperative embolization of the occluded VA significantly reduces the risk of postoperative infarction in a specific cohort of patients with traumatic VAI (i.e., patients with post-traumatic VAO who require cervical surgery).

The patients were divided into a craniotomy group and a cranioplasty group. Head CT scans were analyzed to evaluate bone fusion and resorption.
   RESULTS: Records from 978 patients who underwent craniotomy or cranioplasty between September 2004 and November 2015 were reviewed; 369 patients were eligible for the final analysis (craniotomy, n = 276; cranioplasty, n = 93). The mean cryopreservation period for the bone flap in the cranioplasty group was 49.3 days. The mean patient age was 51.4 +/- 18.1 years in the craniotomy group and 51.6 +/- 17.1 years in the cranioplasty group. Head CT scans showed bone fusion rates of 76.6% in the craniotomy group and 53.3% in the cranioplasty group at 6 months postsurgery (P = 0.015) and 78.6% and 78.1%, respectively, at 1 year post-surgery (P = 0.951). There was also a significant difference in the bone flap resorption rate between the 2 groups.
   CONCLUSIONS: Bone flap fusion rates after craniotomy and cranioplasty were significantly different before 12 months, but not significantly different thereafter. Bone resorption occurred more frequently in the cranioplasty group over time.

AB OBJECTIVE: Intraoperative aneurysm rupture (IPR) always results in a poor prognosis for the patient. However, the risk factors of IPR are unclear. In this article, the risk factors are explored, a nomogram model for predicting IPR is established, and the prognostic factors for patients with IPR are analyzed.
   METHODS: A total of 549 patients with aneurysm, which were embolized from September 2011 to September 2015, were enrolled for analysis. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression were performed to explore the risk factors for IPR, and a nomogram was established. A nonparametric Mann-Whitney U test was performed to analyze prognostic factors for patients with IPR.
   RESULTS: Twenty-one patients (4.4%) experienced IPR. In univariate analysis, Hunt-Hess grade (P = 0.002), time from hospitalization to treatment (P = 0.08) and subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) to treatment (P = 0.08), aneurysm neck (P = 0.08), assistive technique (P = 0.03), and intraoperative cerebral vasospasm (P < 0.001) were significantly associated with IPR. In multivariate analysis, Hunt-Hess grade (odds ratio [OR], 8.177; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.714-39.012; P = 0.008), aneurysm neck (OR, 5.629; 95% CI, 1.149-27.575; P = 0.033), assistive technique (OR, 1.393; 95% CI, 0.961-2.018; P = 0.080), and intraoperative cerebral vasospasm (OR, 4.280; 95% CI, 1.081-16.947; P = 0.038) were independent risk factors for IPR. Hydrocephalus (P = 0.069), history of SAH (P = 0.10), >= 2 SAH (P = 0.051), location of aneurysm (P = 0.09), and number of aneurysms (P = 0.025) were associated with the bad outcome.
   CONCLUSIONS: Hunt-Hess grading, aneurysm neck, intraoperative assistive technology, and vasospasm were independent risk factors for IPR. Hydrocephalus requiring surgical intervention, times of rupture, location of aneurysm, and the number of aneurysms were relevant to the prognosis of patients.

   OUTCOMES; STROKE
AB BACKGROUND: Iatrogenic spinal cord injury (iSCI) during spinal corrective surgery can result in devastating complications, such as paraplegia or paraparesis. Perioperatively, iSCI often occurs as a direct injury during spinal cord instrumentation placement. Currently, treatment of iSCI remains limited to posttraumatic hypothermia, which has demonstrated some value in recent clinical trials. Here we report the outcomes of preinjury hypothermia initiated preprocedurally and maintained for a considerable time after iSCI.
   METHODS: Twenty-six female SpragueeDawley rats were assigned at random to either a normothermic group (36 degrees C) or a hypothermic group (32 degrees C) and then underwent a laminectomy procedure at the T8 level. Each group was further divided at random to receive a 200-kdyn force contusive spinal cord injury or a sham impact. Hypothermic rats were then rewarmed after 2 hours of hypothermic treatment. Behavioral scores, temperature profiles, weights, and somatosensory evoked potentials were obtained at baseline and at specified time points after the procedure.
   RESULTS: The median survival was 42 days for the iSCI hypothermic group and 11 days for the iSCI normothermic group (hazard ratio, 3.82; 95% confidence interval, 1.52-9.57). The probability of survival was significantly higher in the iSCI hypothermic group compared with the iSCI normothermic group (chi(2) = 4.18; P = 0.040). The hypothermic group exhibited a higher Basso, Beattie and Bresnahan (BBB) locomotor rating scale score (17 vs. 14; P < 0.01), lower normalized latencies (1.06 +/- 0.16 seconds vs. 1.34 +/- 0.17 seconds; P = 0.04), and higher peak-to-peak amplitudes (0.32 +/- 0.10 mV vs. 0.12 +/- 0.09 mV; P = 0.005).
   CONCLUSIONS: The use of prophylactic hypothermia before iSCI was significantly associated with an increased survival rate, higher BBB scores, and improved neurophysiological measures.

AB BACKGROUND: This study aimed to investigate the risk of proximal junction kyphosis (PJK) and proximal junction failure (PJF) associated with screw trajectory (straightforward vs. mixed vs. anatomic) at upper instrumented vertebra (UIV).
   METHODS: A single-center, single-surgeon consecutive series of adult patients who underwent lumbar fusion for circle minus 4 levels (the UIV of the thoracolumbar spine, T9-L2, and the lower instrumented vertebra at the sacrum or pelvis) was retrospectively reviewed. Patients were divided into 3 groups according to UIV screw trajectory: group S, 2 straightforward screws; group M, 1 straightforward screw and 1 anatomic trajectory screw; and group A, 2 anatomic trajectory screws.
   RESULTS: A total of 83 patients were included in this study, including 51 in group S, 16 in group M, and 16 in group A. The incidence of PJK in group S (12 patients, 23.5%), group M (7 patients, 43.8%), and group A (9 patients, 56.3%) significantly increased in sequence by group (P = 0.044). Anatomic trajectory screw fixation increased the risk for PJF requiring revision surgery compared with straightforward screw fixation (3 patients [18.8%] vs. 1 patient [2.0%]; P = 0.040). Multivariable analysis identified that anatomic trajectory screw fixation was a significant risk factor for PJK (P = 0.008; adjusted odds ratio = 7.591; 95% confidence interval, 1.69-34.093).
   CONCLUSION: Anatomic trajectory screw fixation at the UIV is a substantial risk factor for PJK and PJF. To reduce PJK and PJF, straightforward screw fixation at the UIV is recommended in adult spinal deformity correction surgery.

AB OBJECTIVE: The Woven EndoBridge (WEB) device is an innovative tool for endovascular treatment of wide-necked bifurcation aneurysms. Numerous studies of primary aneurysm treatment with the WEB device have been reported. We analyzed the safety and efficacy of WEB embolization for recurrent and residual aneurysms.
   METHODS: We performed a retrospective observational study of consecutive patients with initially endovascularly or surgically treated aneurysms and an aneurysm recurrence or remnant retreated with the WEB device at 3 German high-volume neurovascular centers from May 2011 to February 2018. The technical success, complications, and angiographic outcomes were evaluated.
   RESULTS: Eleven patients (median age, 65 years; 5 women) with 11 aneurysms (median size, 6.8 mm) were identified. The aneurysms were located at the anterior communicating artery in 4, basilar tip in 4, internal carotid artery in 1, middle cerebral artery in 1, and posterior communicating artery in 1 patient. Three aneurysms had been previously clipped and 8 had undergone endovascular therapy. WEB embolization was feasible in 10 patients. Ancillary devices were used for 4 aneurysms. Perforation occurred in 1 aneurysm, which resolved without sequelae. Of the 9 patients available for angiographic follow-up (median follow-up, 6 months), complete and nearcomplete aneurysm occlusion was achieved in 3 (33%) and 7 patients (78%), respectively. Three patients underwent repeat treatment (33%).
   CONCLUSIONS: The results of the present study have indicated that WEB embolization of previously treated aneurysms is reasonably safe. However, careful aneurysm selection could be necessary to achieve adequate midterm occlusion rates.

AB BACKGROUND: Uganda has one of the largest unmet neurosurgical needs in the world, but has seen major improvements in neurosurgery-largely centered at Mulago National Referral Hospital (MNRH). This study implements the first long-term follow-up and outcomes analysis of central nervous system tumor patients in Uganda.
   METHODS: Inpatient data were collected using a prospective database of patients presenting to the MNRH neurosurgical ward between 2014 and 2015. Follow-up health care status was assessed in the patient's language using phone surveys. Analysis was performed to identify which factors were associated with patient outcomes.
   RESULTS: The MNRH neurosurgical ward saw 112 patients with central nervous system tumors (adult N = 87, female: 70%, median age: 37 years). Meningiomas (21%) comprised the most common tumor diagnosis. In-hospital mortality (18%), 30-day mortality (22%), and 1-year mortality (35%) were high. Thirty percent of patients underwent tumor resection in-patient and had greater median overall survival (66.5 months vs. 5.1 months for nonsurgical patients, P = 0.025). For those with known pathologic diagnoses, patients with glioblastomas had decreased median overall survival (0.83 months vs. 59 months for meningiomas, P = 0.02). Phone interviews yielded an 85% response rate. Of the survivors at the time of follow-up, 55% reported a subjective return to normalcy, and 75% received follow-up care for their tumor with most returning to MNRH.
   CONCLUSIONS: We show evidence for improved overall survival with surgical care at MNRH. In addition, phone interviews as a method of measuring health outcomes provided an effective means of follow-up, showing that most patients do seek follow-up care.

AB BACKGROUND: The neurosurgery literature lacks a comprehensive report of neurosurgical randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published in general medical journals. RCTs published in these journals have high visibility and impact on decision-making by general medical practitioners and health care policymakers.
   METHODS: A systematic review of neurosurgical RCTs in the New England Journal of Medicine, The Lancet, Journal of the American Medical Association, The BMJ, and Annals of Internal Medicine was completed.
   RESULTS: There were 78 neurosurgical RCTs published in the selected high-impact journals from 2000 to 2017. The most common study topics were neurovascular (n=39, 50%) and spine (n=24, 30.8%). Of these RCTs, 44 (56.4%) compared operative with nonoperative management. For studies published before 2017, the mean number of citations was 899. Approximately half of the studies showed superiority of operative management over nonoperative management in the intent to treat primary outcome of interest (n=24, 54.5%). However, stratified by subsubspecialty, 7 (87.5%) of the functional RCTs, 9 (50%) of the neurovascular RCTs, 1 (50%) of the trauma RCTs, and 7 (43.8%) of the spinal RCTs demonstrated superiority of operative management over nonoperative management. Additionally, there were large subspecialty differences in study characteristics, such as rate of double blinding, proportion of patient enrollment from patients screened, and proportion of crossover from nonsurgical to surgical arm.
   CONCLUSIONS: Neurosurgical RCTs in general medical journals have large subspecialty differences in characteristics such as crossovers from nonsurgical to surgical treatment arms and the proportion of studies demonstrating benefit of operative intervention over nonoperative management.

AB BACKGROUND: The underlying mechanisms of headache in adult moyamoya disease (MMD) are not clear. The aim of this study is to clarify the factors that are associated with headache in adult patients with MMD after superficial temporal artery (STA)-middle cerebral artery (MCA) anastomosis.
   METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the cases of 68 adult patients with MMD: 30 with surgery and 38 without surgery. Each STA-MCA anastomosis was performed by the standard technique. Magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) and single photon emission computed tomography were performed perioperatively. We stratified the intensity and frequency of the patients' headaches into 4 ranks. Pre-and postoperative STA diameters were retrospectively measured on digital subtraction angiography (DSA) and/or MRA.
   RESULTS: In the surgery group, preoperative regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) laterality and a postoperative rCBF increase >20% showed no significant difference between the patients with and without headache with a univariate analysis. The postoperative STA diameters of the distal branch (DSA) and main trunk (DSA/MRA) in the patients with headache were significantly larger than those of the patients without headache. The rate of postoperative increase of the STA diameters of the distal branch/main trunk was also significantly higher in the patients with headache than those without headache. A multivariate analysis showed that the standard regression coefficient beta for sex, a >20% increase of postoperative rCBF, and the increase rate of the STA diameter of the distal branch shown by DSA was 0.37, 0.54, and 0.56, respectively.
   CONCLUSIONS: The results of our analyses revealed that aside from ischemia, the postoperative increase rate of the STA may be a candidate reason for headache, especially in adult patients with MMD.

AB BACKGROUND: The surgical resection of large supracerebellar hemangioblastomas (SHBs) is exceptionally challengingdueto their vascularityanddeepanatomiclocationand is associated with a high risk of postoperative complications and mortality. Access to the posterior incisural space can be achieved by either an infratentorial supracerebellar approach or occipital transtentorial approach (OTA). However, the optimalsurgical strategyhasnotyetbeenestablished. Here, we report 2 cases of large SHBs that were successfully and safely resected via a unilateral OTAwith multimodal assistance.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: Two patients presented to our hospital with ataxia due to large, solid SHBs. After preoperative embolization, gross total resection of the SHBswas achieved via an OTA. Furthermore, endoscopic assistance was used to resect the remnant portion of the tumor in the second patient. Both patients experienced transient ataxia but were discharged from the hospital without serious complications.
   CONCLUSIONS: The combination of an OTA with preoperative embolization and endoscopic assistance may reduce the intraoperative risk and contribute to improved outcome in patients with such clinically challenging tumors.

AB BACKGROUND: Granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) has been observed to have direct protective effects on neurons after stroke in experimental models and in humans. In the present study, the antiapoptotic effects of G-CSF on spinal alpha-motoneurons after inducement of peripheral sciatic nerve lesions were evaluated in a rat model.
   METHODS: Of 48 rats, 24 were treated with G-CSF and 24 were treated with glucose 5% solution (control group). The spinal cord of 6 rats in each group were removed at days 1, 4, 7, and 14. The alpha-motoneurons of spinal cord section L4-L6 were counted and investigated for the expression of choline acetyltransferase (ChAT), G-CSF receptor (G-CSFR), and Bcl-2 and Bax proteins. Additionally, alpha-motoneuron fluorescence double staining was performed for ChAT/Bcl-2, ChAT/Bax, and ChAT/G-CSFR.
   RESULTS: Without G-CSF treatment, the number of ChAT-positive alpha-motoneurons on the lesion side was significantly decreased (P < 0.001). The number of alpha-motoneurons with Bcl-2 and G-CSFR positivity on the lesion side was significantly decreased (P < 0.05). In contrast, the number of alpha-motoneurons with Bax positivity was significantly greater (P < 0.05). After G-CSF treatment, the differences in the number of alpha-motoneurons on the 2 sides were not statistically significant. Fluorescence double staining of alpha-motoneurons was positive for ChAT/Bcl-2, ChAT/Bax, and ChAT/G-CSFR.
   CONCLUSION: The results indicated that G-CSF has neuroprotective properties in spinal alpha-motoneurons and contributes to antiapoptotic effects after peripheral nerve lesions. The relevance of G-CSF, its precise mode of action, and the effect of these findings in clinical situations remains to be elucidated and require examination in further studies.

ID SHORT-TERM COMPLICATIONS; SPINE SURGERY; ELDERLY-PATIENTS; SAFETY
AB BACKGROUND: Same-day surgery has been demonstrated to be a safe and cost-effective alternative to traditional inpatient surgery. Several studies have demonstrated no differences in the postoperative complication profile or 30-day hospital readmission rates with outpatient versus inpatient anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF). However, none of these studies compared the outcomes in elderly patients (aged >65 years) undergoing ACDF. Whether the results from previous studies can be applied to this subgroup pf patients remains unknown. The aim of the present study was to compare the 30-day hospital readmission rates for Medicare patients (aged >65 years) undergoing outpatient versus inpatient ACDF.
   METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of a Medicare database, including data from 17,421 patients. Of the 17,421 patients, 16,386 had undergone inpatient ACDF and 1035, outpatient ACDF. Age, sex, comorbidities, postoperative complications, readmission rates, and overall financial costs were compared between the 2 cohorts.
   RESULTS: In a Medicare sample (aged >65 years), inpatient ACDF was associated with a greater incidence of postoperative complications compared with outpatient ACDF. Outpatient surgery was associated with significantly lower rates of postoperative complications (urinary tract infection, surgical site infection, deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, and myocardial infarction) and significantly lower treatment costs (P <= 0.001). All-cause 30-day hospital readmission rates were also greater for inpatients (10.1% vs. 4%; P = 0.17).
   CONCLUSION: The results from the present study suggest that outpatient ACDF appears to be safe and effective with low complication and readmission rates in a Medicare patient sample.

ID BASILAR ARTERY-OCCLUSION; STROKE; ONSET; MRI
AB BACKGROUND: There are currently no imaging criteria to identify patients who would benefit from endovascular recanalization of posterior circulation strokes. Applying the Posterior Circulation Alberta Stroke Program Early Computed Tomography Score (pc-ASPECTS) to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been demonstrated to be an accurate predictor of functional outcome. Here, we aimed to evaluate the accuracy of the pc-ASPECTS with preintervention MRI as a predictor of functional outcome in a cohort undergoing endovascular recanalization.
   METHODS: This is a 15-year retrospective study of patients undergoing endovascular recanalization of posterior circulation with baseline MRI or computed tomography. We analyzed baseline imaging, clinical data, and type and timing of intervention to the functional outcome at 90 days. Using MRI pc-ASPECTS, we evaluated interrater reliability and accuracy in predicting functional outcome and compared them to the use of single-anatomic location for this function.
   RESULTS: Door-to-recanalization time in the MRI cohort was significantly longer (median: 8.7 vs. 2.7 hours, P = 0.03); however, functional outcome was not different. Within the MRI cohort, pc-ASPECTS and National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale were the only factors that were significantly different between the groups with good and bad functional outcome (P < 0.001). The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for the pc-ASPECTS and good functional outcome was 0.96, with the optimal threshold of >= 8 resulting in positive predictive value of 90% and negative predictive value of 100%.
   CONCLUSIONS: Despite longer time to intervention with MRI as the initial imaging modality in posterior circulation strokes, it does not negatively affect the functional outcome. Pc-ASPECTS is an easy to use and accurate prognostic tool for the real-time evaluation of preintervention MRI in this population.

AB BACKGROUND: Spontaneous intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) of the cerebellum can be life threatening because of mass effect on the brainstem and fourth ventricle. Suboccipital craniectomy is currently the treatment of choice for cerebellar ICH evacuation. Minimally invasive surgery (MIS) is currently being investigated for the treatment of supratentorial ICH. However, its utility for cerebellar ICH is unknown. The aim of this multicenter, retrospective cohort study is to evaluate the outcomes of MIS for cerebellar ICH.
   METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the records of all patients with cerebellar ICH who underwent MIS using either the Apollo or Artemis Neuro Evacuation Device (Penumbra Inc., Alameda, California, USA) at 3 institutions from May 2015 to July 2018. Data from each contributing center were deidentified and pooled for analysis.
   RESULTS: The study cohort comprised 6 patients with a median age of 62.5 years. The median pre- and postoperative Glasgow Coma Scale scores were 10.5 and 15, respectively. The median degree of hematoma evacuation was 97.5% (range, 79%-100%). There were no procedural complications, but 1 patient required subsequent craniectomy (retreatment rate 17%). The median discharge modified Rankin scale score was 4, including 3 patients who improved to functional independence at follow-up durations of 3 months. Two patients died from medical complications (mortality rate 33%).
   CONCLUSIONS: MIS could represent a reasonable alternative to conventional surgery for the treatment of appropriately selected patients with cerebellar ICH. However, further studies are needed to clarify the perioperative and long-term risk to benefit profiles of this technique.

AB OBJECTIVE: To analyze the effects of direct vertebral rotation (DVR) on radiologic outcomes in the treatment of thoracic adolescent idiopathic scoliosis after selective thoracic fusion with pedicle screw instrumentation.
   METHODS: Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis patients with single thoracic curves (n = 110) treated by selective thoracic fusion with a minimum of 2 years of follow-up were retrospectively analyzed. The patients were separated into 2 groups: non-DVR (n = 63) and DVR (n = 47).
   RESULTS: There was a significant difference in fused segments between the non-DVR and DVR groups (P < 0.001). There was also a significant difference in main thoracic curve postoperatively (P = 0.001) and at the last follow-up (P = 0.006) between the non-DVR and DVR groups. However, there was no significant difference in proximal thoracic and lumbar curves postoperatively (proximal thoracic curve: P = 0.186; lumbar curve: P = 0.155) and at the last follow-up (proximal thoracic curve: P = 0.250; lumbar curve: P = 0.060) between the 2 groups. Significant improvements in the lowest instrumented vertebra tilt and disc angle were noted but then slight deteriorations in such were observed during the follow-up period in the non-DVR group. The prevalence of unsatisfactory results was 20.6% (13 of 63) in the non-DVR group and 19.1% (9 of 47) in the DVR group, with no significant difference (P = 0.522).
   CONCLUSIONS: For correcting single thoracic adolescent idiopathic scoliosis by selective thoracic fusion with pedicle screw instrumentation, the addition of DVR to the surgical procedure showed comparable radiologic outcomes compared with non-DVR procedures.

ID TECHNICAL NOTE; DECOMPRESSION; STENOSIS; DRAINAGE; MRI
AB BACKGROUND: Although postoperative spinal epidural hematoma is a rare complication, it can cause severe neurologic complications. Studies regarding biportal endoscopic spinal surgery, a type of minimally invasive spinal surgery technique, have been recently reported. The purpose of our study is to report the incidence and risk factors of postoperative hematoma after biportal endoscopic spinal surgery.
   METHODS: The subjects included 310 patients that underwent biportal endoscopic spinal surgery from 2015 to 2017. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed in all patients before surgery, and also after surgery to identify epidural hematoma. Using electronic medical records, perioperative factors such as age, sex, operation name, operation level, water infusion pump usage, thrombin-containing hemostatic agent, and anticoagulant medication were statistically analyzed in the aspect of postoperative hematoma.
   RESULTS: The overall occurrence rate of postoperative hematoma was 23.6% (n = 94). A total of 304 levels (76.4%) were without hematoma according to the postoperative MRI among the total 398 levels. Six patients underwent revision surgery of hematoma evacuation. Female sex, old age (>70 years), preoperative anticoagulation medication, and usage of intraoperative water infusion pump were significantly correlated to the occurrence of postoperative hematoma.
   CONCLUSIONS: Although symptomatic postoperative hematoma was extremely rare at 1.9%, radiologic hematoma confirmed by postoperative MRI was higher at 23.6%. The perioperative risk factors of postoperative hematoma after biportal endoscopic spinal surgery include female sex, older age (>70 years), preoperative anticoagulation medication, usage of intraoperative water infusion pump, and surgery requiring more bone work (laminectomy or interbody fusion).

AB OBJECTIVE: Repair of spinal cord injury (SCI) using peripheral nerve graft (PNG) and acidic fibroblast growth factor (aFGF) has shown promising results in rats and a few human patients, but not in nonhuman primates. The aim of this study was to verify the effective use of PNG and aFGF for repairing incomplete SCI in nonhuman primates.
   METHODS: Six adult rhesus macaques received spinal cord hemisection at T8 level and were grouped into repair and control groups (n = 3 in each). Animals in the repair group underwent nerve repair with autologous PNG plus aFGF immediately after lesioning. The control group received exactly the same operation for lesioning but no treatment. Postoperative behavioral evaluations, electrophysiologic tests (including motor and somatosensory evoked potentials), and magnetic resonance imaging were performed and compared between the 2 groups as well as histologic examination of the spinal cord cephalic to, at, and caudal to the lesion site after sacrifice.
   RESULTS: Animals in the repair group had better motor function in the lower limbs at every observed time point and demonstrated more improvement on electrophysiologic examinations than the control group. The repair group had smaller areas of myelomalacia on magnetic resonance imaging around the lesion compared with the control group, suggesting diminished inflammatory responses with the repair strategy.
   CONCLUSIONS: PNG plus aFGF for SCI in nonhuman primates yielded improvements in clinical behavior, electrophysiologic tests, and magnetic resonance imaging. This study suggests that the repair strategy is feasible and effective for nonhuman primate SCI. Further investigations are warranted to corroborate its effectiveness for clinical application.

AB BACKGROUND: Neurogenic stunned myocardium (NSM) is a devastating complication of subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). The most widely accepted mechanism in the pathogenesis of NSM and takotsubo cardiomyopathy is catecholamine-mediated direct myocardial injury. The aim of this study is to examine if there is any effect of sympathetic overactivity of the stellate ganglions on myocardial tissues, secondary to vagal complex degeneration in SAH-induced NSM.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study was conducted on 25 New Zealand female rabbits. After the examination, all animals were assigned into 3 groups randomly: a control group (n = 5), a sham group (n = 5), and a study group (n = 15) that was subjected to experimental SAH with double injection of blood into the cisterna magna. After 7 animals exhibited NSM, all animals were killed. Their brains, vagal complexes, stellate ganglions, and hearts were extracted and examined by histopathologic methods. Degenerated nodose ganglion neurons and stellate ganglion neuron densities were compared with degenerated myocardial tissue/normal myocardial tissue ratios, and the results were analyzed with the Mann-Whitney U test.
   RESULTS: Three rabbits in the study group died immediately after the second injection of blood. NSM developed in 7 animals after 1 to 5 days, which was diagnosed with transthoracic echocardiography. Interestingly, the animals that developed NSM had more stellate ganglia neurons and more degenerated neuron densities of nodose ganglia (P < 0.001).
   CONCLUSIONS: NSM and takotsubo cardiomyopathy may be induced by vagal complex degeneration and sympathetic overactivity, which originated from more neurons, including stellate ganglia and more degenerated neuron densities of nodose ganglia.

AB BACKGROUND: Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak remains a significant complication of posterior fossa tumor surgery. The goal of this study was to evaluate the wound CSF leakage rate in pediatric patients who underwent fourth ventricle tumor resection in a single-site setting and to explore the association of CSF leakage with the length of stay in the intensive care unit (ICU) and with dural sealant application.
   METHODS: Two hundred and eleven patients who underwent fourth ventricle tumor surgery between 2008 and 2016 were included in this study. Patient data were evaluated retrospectively.
   RESULTS: Postoperative wound CSF leakage was observed in 6 patients (2.8%). One hundred and seventy-six patients (83.4%) stayed in the ICU for <= 1 day, and CSF leakage developed in 4 of these patients (2.3%). Thirty-five patients (16.6%) stayed in the ICU for >1 day, and CSF leakage was observed in 2 of these patients (5.7%). The observed difference was not statistically significant (P = 0.260). There were no statistically significant differences in the CSF leakage rates in groups with and without dural sealing before (n = 2 [3%] and n [4 = 2.8%], respectively; P = 0.99) and after (n = 2 [3.0%] and n = 4 [6.0%], respectively; P = 0.68) application of the propensity score matching algorithm.
   CONCLUSIONS: The low CSF leakage rate (2.8%) identified in this study was associated with a certain algorithm of patient management. There was no strong evidence that the CSF leakage rate was associated with the length of stay in the ICU or with dural sealant application.

AB OBJECTIVE: The association of primary brain tumors with coexisting unruptured intracranial aneurysms (UIAs) has been debated, and treatment strategies have not yet been established. We evaluated the flow association between brain tumors and coexisting UIAs and the outcomes of patients with brain tumor who did not receive treatment of coexisting UIAs.
   METHODS: The medical records of patients with coexisting UIAs and brain tumors who had undergone surgical tumor resection were retrospectively analyzed to evaluate the incidence of UIAs according to tumor type, association of arterial feeder vessels and coexisting UIAs, and the occurrence of subarachnoid hemorrhage during the follow-up period for patients who had not receive treatment for the UIAs.
   RESULTS: Of the 55 patients, 21 (38.9%) had undergone treatment of UIAs and 33 (61.1%) had received regular follow-up examinations without UIA treatment. Two patients (6.1%) developed subarachnoid hemorrhage. Of the 33 patients with astrocytic or oligodendroglial tumors who had not undergone treatment of UIAs, 2 had experienced an interval increase. Flow-related UIAs were found to be significantly more common in patients with astrocytic or oligodendroglial tumors than in those with tumors of other histological types (P [0.01).
   CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of UIAs among patients with primary brain tumors appears to be greater than that in the general population. An interval increase in aneurysm size and aneurysmal rupture was observed in 2 patients with astrocytic or oligodendroglial tumors. We would recommend perioperative treatment of flow-related UIAs in patients with astrocytic or oligodendroglial tumors and noninvasive evaluations such as magnetic resonance angiography if coexisting UIAs remain untreated.

AB OBJECTIVE: To identify causes of recurrent hemifacial spasm (HFS) after initial microvascular decompression (MVD) and to assess the feasibility of redo MVD.
   METHODS: The study included 21 patients who underwent redo MVD over the last 2 decades. Their medical charts were retrospectively reviewed for preoperative medical history, previous and redo MVD intraoperative findings, and previous and redo MVD postoperative outcomes.
   RESULTS: Redo MVDs were the second operation in 20 patients and the third operation in 1 patient. The median interval between previous and redo MVD was 46.3 months (range, 14.4-188.2 months). Compression of offending vessels such as a vein or perforating artery located medial to or at the cisternal segment of the facial nerve was found to be a possible cause of previous MVD failure. MVD failure resulted from neglect of offending vessels in 10 patients, insufficient decompression in 7 patients, and untouched neurovascular compression sites in 4 patients. Spasm-free rates after redo MVD were 80.5% at 1 year and 90.5% in the last year of follow-up (median, 15.8 months; range, 3.6-152.0 months). Permanent hearing loss and facial palsy were each observed in 2 patients (9.5%). In addition, 1 patient each experienced cerebellar infarction and vocal cord palsy.
   CONCLUSIONS: Redo MVD remains a feasible treatment option for patients with HFS who failed to benefit from previous MVD, but it is associated with an increased risk of cranial nerve and vascular injuries.

AB OBJECTIVE: To present a preliminary experience of perioperative management for patients with spinal tuberculosis (STB) and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and discuss strategic factors that should be considered.
   METHODS: A retrospective study of 6 patients with STB and ESRD who underwent spine surgeries in our hospital from January 2010 to May 2017 was carried out. Medical records were reviewed for clinical manifestations, laboratory examinations, radiologic findings, perioperative management, clinical outcomes, and complications.
   RESULTS: Except for 1 patient who died of cardiac arrest 5 days after surgery, this case series was followed with a mean follow-up period of 17.0 months (range, 9-23). There were no patients reporting major side effects related to an adjusted antituberculosis chemotherapy regimen. Post-operatively, surgical incision healed primarily, whereas delirium and pneumonia were noted in 2 patients. At final follow-ups, solid bony fusion was achieved in 4 patients, whereas fusion was indefinite in the patient who underwent surgery at L3/4 level. Visual analogue scale score improved from preoperative 5.2 +/- 0.37 to 2.6 +/- 0.55 at the final follow-ups.
   CONCLUSIONS: Perioperative management of patients with STB and ESRD is a complicated issue, with multiple factors to be considered. Spinal surgery can achieve acceptable outcomes in these patients if meticulous management is performed.

AB OBJECTIVE: To evaluate clinical and radiologic results as well as biomechanical changes after anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF), cervical disc replacement (CDR), and posterior cervical foraminotomy (PCF) and/or discectomy in individuals with unilateral single-level cervical radiculopathy.
   METHODS: A total of 97 patients received surgical treatment for unilateral intolerable radiculopathy between February 2012 and August 2017. Clinical outcomes included Neck Disability Index (NDI), visual analogue scale (VAS) for neck and arm pain, and modified Odom's criteria. Range of motion (ROM) of the whole cervical (C-ROM), operated segment (S-ROM), and upper and lower adjacent segment (U-ROM and L-ROM) were measured.
   RESULTS: A total of 55 ACDFs, 21 CDRs, and 21 PCFs were performed. Clinical improvement in NDI and VAS scores were significant after surgery; however, there was no statistical significance among groups. Satisfaction rate (based on Odom's criteria) of PCF (76.2%) was inferior to that of ACDF (90.9%) and CDR (90.5%) without statistical difference. S-ROM, U-ROM, and L-ROM were slightly better in the CDR and PCF groups, without statistical significance. C-ROM significantly increased in CDR group (P = 0.04) and slightly increased in PCF group (P = 0.27). In the ACDF group, C-ROM decreased (P = 0.21) and on the contrary, the U-ROM and L-ROM increased (P > 0.05).
   CONCLUSIONS: ACDF, CDR, and PCF resulted in pain relief and improvement in neck function for patients with unilateral radiculopathy. Comparatively, ACDF provides the lowest reoperation rate. CDR is effective in ameliorating cervical ROMs. PCF has a greater probability of reoperation; however, ROM after surgery is better than with ACDF.

AB BACKGROUND: For multilevel cervical fusion, anterior corpectomy and fusion (ACCF) induces more implant-related complications than anterior diskectomy and fusion (ACDF), which implies that the biomechanical stability of ACCF may be insufficient. The aim of this study was to assess whether the optimization of the cage profiles could improve the biomechanical performance of multilevel ACCF.
   METHODS: Three finite element models were constructed and compared, including 3-level ACDF, 2-level ACCF using a conventional cage for reconstruction, and 2-level ACCF using a new cage for reconstruction. The ends of the new cage possessed additional end rings and emulated the end plate geometries. The ranges of motion (ROMs) of the surgical segments and the stress peaks in the end plate, fixation system, and screw-bone interface were compared.
   RESULTS: Compared with preoperative status, ACDF and ACCF reduced the segmental ROMs by 96.1%-98.2%. The end plate stress peaks were the highest in ACCF using the conventional cage (10.1-18.6 MPa), followed by ACCF using the new cage (7.7-14.3 MPa) and ACDF (5.3-9.1 MPa). ACDF induced the highest stress peaks in the fixation system and screw-bone interface (32.5-39.3 MPa and 12.1-12.7 MPa, respectively), followed by ACCF using the conventional cage (20.4-31.7 MPa and 10.3-13.6 MPa, respectively) and ACCF using the new cage (18.6-25.7 MPa and 9.7-12.6 MPa, respectively).
   CONCLUSIONS: The application of the new cage decreased the risks of cage subsidence and instrument-related complications in multilevel ACCF. Under the condition where cage subsidence was prevented, ACCF was superior to ACDF in terms of construct stability and avoiding instrument-related complications.

AB OBJECTIVE: To characterize the intratumoral immune microenvironment and evaluate its clinical implications in patients with primary axial osteosarcoma.
   METHODS: Immunohistochemistry was used to interpret tumor programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression and tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) profile of cluster of differentiation 8 (CD8), PD-L1, and programmed death 1 (PD-1) within 69 tumor specimens.
   RESULTS: Overall, all tumor specimens presented lymphocytic infiltrates, with PD-L1+ TILs being the most common subset (mean, 215.1 per slide mm(2)). Positive tumor PD-L1 expression was presented in 43.5% of tumors. Moderate to strong relationships were detected among TILs subsets and tumor PD-L1 expression. In addition, the density of PD-L1+ TILs was significantly correlated with favorable clinicopathologic features, including earlier Enneking stage. The positivity of tumor PD-L1 expression was associated with the tumor site and pathologic grade (P = 0.021 and 0.037, respectively). In univariate survival analysis, the high density of PD-L1+ TILs or CD8+ TILs was significantly correlated with both prolonged event-free survival and overall survival (OS), whereas the high infiltration of PD-1+ TILs was significantly associated with reduced OS, as was the positive tumor PD-L1 expression. Furthermore, multivariate analysis showed that CD8+ TILs and PD-L1+ TILs remained their significance for both event-free survival (P = 0.012 and 0.004, respectively) and OS (P = 0.033 and 0.002, respectively). However, both PD-1+ TILs and tumor PD-L1 expression failed to reach significance for OS.
   CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggested that the immune microenvironment is of clinically relevant significance in patients with axial osteosarcoma. Specifically, we identified both PD-L1+ TILs and CD8+ TILs as independent favorable prognostic markers.

AB OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the safety and efficacy of stent-only technique with Low-profile Visualized Intraluminal Support (LVIS) for uncoilable intracranial aneurysms.
   METHODS: Twelve uncoilable aneurysms in 12 patients were treated with the stent-only technique in our department from January 1, 2016, to December 31, 2017. The characteristics of the aneurysms and the patients were analyzed. The midterm follow-up results of these patients also were analyzed.
   RESULTS: Twelve patients (7 male and 5 female) were enrolled in the series. The 12 aneurysms included 6 vertebralebasilar artery aneurysms, 3 internal carotid artery aneurysms (2 blood blister-Llike aneurysms and 1 posterior communicating artery aneurysm), 1 posterior cerebral artery dissecting, 1 anterior cerebral artery dissecting of the third segment, and 1 pseudoaneurysm at the first segment of the anterior cerebral artery. Seven aneurysms were? ruptured, whereas 5 remained unruptured. A total of 24 LVIS stents were deployed. Three aneurysms were covered by 3 overlapped stents, 6 aneurysms were covered by 2 stents, and the other 3 aneurysms were covered by 1 stent. All procedures were successful without any perioperative complications. Imaging follow-up between 3 and 10 months after operation was available in all 12 patients, with complete obliteration in 10 aneurysms, improvement in 1, and parent artery occlusion in 1.
   CONCLUSIONS: LVIS stent-only technique is safe and efficacious for uncoilable aneurysms, even for ruptured ones.

AB OBJECTIVE: To identify predictors of short-term mortality and complications after anterior odontoid screw fixation.
   METHODS: This was a retrospective analysis of a national database. The American College of Surgeons National Quality Improvement Database was queried using Current Procedural Terminology codes to identify patients aged >= 60 years who underwent surgery for anterior fixation of odontoid fracture admitted from 2007 to 2016. Univariate analysis and subsequent multivariate analysis were used to analyze risk factors for postoperative complications and 30-day postoperative mortality. Complications were defined as surgical-site infection, wound breakdown, pneumonia, venous thromboembolism, stroke, myocardial infarction, sepsis, renal progressive renal insufficiency/acute kidney injury, or cardiac arrest.
   RESULTS: A total of 198 patients were identified. Mean age was 77.7 (+/- 8.7) years and 60.6% were female. Overall mortality rate was 7.6%, and the complication rate was 9.1%. In multivariate analysis, dependent functional status (0.012; odds ratio [OR] 5.2; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.42-18.72) and preoperative systemic inflammatory response syndrome (P = 0.011; OR 6.2; 95% CI 1.52-25.79) predicted mortality. Emergency case status (P = 0.033; OR 3.4; 95% CI 1.10-10.70) predicted perioperative complications. Age was not significantly associated with either complications or mortality in multivariate analysis.
   CONCLUSIONS: Functional dependence and preoperative systemic inflammatory response syndrome predict mortality following odontoid screw placement. Although age often is considered a limiting factor in pursuing surgical intervention in patients with odontoid fracture, age did not independently increase odds of either complications or perioperative mortality in this analysis. Further studies are needed to explore these findings.

AB OBJECTIVE: We compared the biomechanical differences among posterolateral fusion (PLF) and transforaminal, extreme, and oblique lumbar interbody fusion (TLIF, XLIF, and OLIF, respectively) procedures.
   METHODS: An intact finite element (FE) model of the L3-L5 lumbar spine was constructed. The PLF, TLIF with a banana-shaped cage, TLIF with a straight cage, XLIF, and OLIF procedures were simulated at the L4-L5 level. The range of motion (ROM) and stress peaks in the cortical endplate, cancellous bone, and posterior instrument were compared among the 5 constructs.
   RESULTS: The PLF construct had much greater ROM than did the other constructs (0.44 degrees-1.05 degrees vs. 0.28 degrees-0.72 degrees). The TLIF with a straight cage induced the greatest stress peaks in the endplate and cancellous bone (24.94-60.03 MPa and 0.72-1.96 MPa, respectively), followed by the TLIF with a banana-shaped cage (23.73-44.8 MPa and 0.6-1.36 MPa, respectively). The OLIF construct (16.76-32.41 MPa and 0.54-1.07 MPa, respectively) and XLIF construct (17.01-35.34 MPa and 0.56-1.12 MPa, respectively) induced much lower stress peaks in the endplate and cancellous bone. In the PLF construct, the stress peaks in the posterior instrument ranged from 244.6 to 377.4 MPa, significantly greater than those in the other constructs (123.9-237.4 MPa).
   CONCLUSION: The PLF had less stability than the other 3 fusion procedures owing to the greater ROM and stress peaks in the posterior instrument. The OLIF and XLIF induced fewer stress peaks in the cortical endplate and cancellous bone than did the TLIF procedure, which was beneficial for subsidence resistance and disc height and segmental angle maintenance.

AB INTRODUCTION: The natural history of growth and radiologic progression of neuromuscular choristomas (NMCs) remain unknown. The purpose of this study was to describe the radiologic growth pattern of NMCs and to determine how the pattern of growth relates to clinical progression.
   METHODS: A retrospective review was performed for patients with a confirmed diagnosis of NMC and at least 2 years of radiologic (magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]) follow-up. Medical records, including physical examinations and radiologic studies, were reviewed in detail. The NMC length and transverse dimensions were compared between serial MRI examinations.
   RESULTS: Eleven patients with a mean radiologic follow-up time of 5.6 years (range 2-19 years) were identified. Motor deficits occurred in 10 patients (90%), sensory deficits in 5 patients (45%), and neuropathic pain in 4 (36%) patients. Eight patients (73%) presented with manifestations of limb undergrowth, 2 (18%) with congenital hip dysplasia, and 1 with a cavus foot deformity. Progression of motor and sensory deficits was observed in 5 (45%) and 1 (9%) patients, respectively. The maximal length and height of the NMC was significantly (P < 0.05) longer (initial 218 +/- 118 mm vs. follow-up 270 +/- 135 mm) and larger (20 +/- 10 mm vs. 24 +/- 14 mm) on the follow-up scan. MRI demonstrated abnormalities that were in continuity along the longitudinal extent of the NMC.
   CONCLUSIONS: According to this small but relatively long-term follow-up cohort, the growth pattern of this lesion is slow but progressive. We found a longitudinal continuity pattern of growth in all MRI scans, often spanning a great distance.

AB INTRODUCTION: Primary central nervous system (pCNS) melanoma is an extremely rare malignant tumor. We explored the incidence, outcomes, and predictors of pCNS melanoma.
   METHODS: We queried the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database to identify all patients diagnosed with pCNS melanoma during 1973-2015. Overall survival (OS) was obtained by using the Kaplan-Meier curves. Log-rank test was used to compare survival across groups of age, sex, race, tumor location, size, surgical resection, radiotherapy, chemotherapy and year of diagnosis. Cox regression was used for univariate and multivariate analysis of survival.
   RESULTS: A total of 84 pCNS melanomas were identified with a 5-year OS of 37.7%. The overall age-adjusted incidence rate was 0.52 per 10,000,000 person-years. Age <= 19 years (vs. age 20-59 years, hazard ratio [HR] = 2.37, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.11-5.07, P = 0.03) and intracranial location (vs. intraspinal, HR = 1.98, 95% CI: 1.04-3.77, P = 0.04) were associated with decreased survival rate. Gross total resection surgery (vs. partial resection, HR = 0.31, 95% CI: 0.15-0.66, P = 0.002) was associated with improved survival rate. There was no significant association between other demographic characteristics, tumor size, therapy methods, year of diagnosis, and OS.
   CONCLUSIONS: The overall age-adjusted incidence rate of pCNS melanoma is 0.52 per 10,000,000 person-years. Age <= 19 years and intracranial tumor location are independent risk factors of low survival rate, whereas gross total resection is associated with better survival rate.

AB BACKGROUND: Severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) is the most common cause of disability in children. Refractory increased intracranial pressure can be a therapeutic challenge. Decompressive craniectomy can be proposed when medical management is insufficient, but its place is not clearly defined in guidelines. The aim of this study was to identify prognostic factors in children with TBI.
   METHODS: We performed a retrospective, multicenter study to analyze long-term outcomes of 150 children with severe TBI treated by decompressive craniectomy and to identify prognostic factors.
   RESULTS: A satisfactory neurologic evolution (represented by a King's Outcome Scale for Childhood Head Injury score >3) was observed in 62% of children with a mean follow-up of 3.5 years. Mortality rate was 17%. Prognostic factors associated with outcome were age, initial Glasgow Coma Scale score, presence of mydriasis, neuromonitoring values (maximal intracranial pressure >30 mm Hg), and radiologic findings (Rotterdam score >= 4).
   CONCLUSIONS: This study in a large population confirms that children with severe TBI treated by decompressive craniectomy can achieve a good neurologic outcome. Further studies are needed to clarify the use of this surgery in the management of children with severe TBI.

AB OBJECTIVE: To review the surgical outcomes of the octogenarian population at a single institution after spinal traumatic injury.
   METHODS: Patients with both radiographic and clinical evidence of acute traumatic spine injury were reviewed using an institutional trauma survey to determine patient demographics and outcome data in a population of patients aged 80 years and older.
   RESULTS: Thirty-nine patients aged 80 years and older underwent surgical intervention for acute spinal trauma. There were 25 cases of cervical spine and 14 cases of thoracolumbar spine surgical intervention. Falls were the number one cause of acute spinal injury (31/39, 71%). Major respiratory disorders were the most common postoperative adverse event (12/39, 31%). Five patients experienced superficial wound dehiscence, fascial dehiscence, superficial infection, or delayed wound erosion. Patients were either discharged to home (10.5%), inpatient rehabilitation, (38.5%), skilled nursing facilities (17.9%), or long-term care facilities (17.9%). The postoperative mortality was 10.3%.
   CONCLUSIONS: Although the octogenarian population has increased risk for postoperative events after acute spinal injuries, surgical intervention may be worthwhile in the elderly population. Although direct surgical complication rates are not higher, medical risks are significantly higher after surgery.

   ORBITOPTERIONAL APPROACH; MEMBRANE
AB BACKGROUND: Shunt-dependent hydrocephalus (SDH) is a common complication after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage and affects its outcome significantly. Whether fenestration of the lamina terminalis (FLT) during anterior circulation aneurysm clipping for aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage can decrease the occurrence of SDH is still controversial.
   METHODS: Ovid and PubMed databases were retrieved by the following key words: "hydrocephalus," "subarachnoid hemorrhage," "aneurysm," "fenestration," and "lamina terminalis." The Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test was used to compare overall incidence of SDH.
   RESULTS: The literatures were searched, and 15 were included involving 2839 patients. The overall incidence of SDH in fenestrated cohort was 11.4%, compared with 15.3% in the nonfenestrated cohort (P = 0.008). The relative risk of SDH in fenestrated cohort was 0.67 (95% confidence interval 0.50-0.90).
   CONCLUSIONS: This meta-analysis suggests that FLT during anterior circulation aneurysm clipping reduces the incidence of SDH. However, a well-designed, randomized controlled trial is necessary to prove the efficacy of FLT to reduce SDH.

TI Can Lipomatosis of the Nerve Occur or Extend Intradurally?

LA English
DT Article

   nerves
ID FIBROLIPOMATOUS HAMARTOMA; NEURAL FIBROLIPOMA
AB BACKGROUND: Diverse adipose lesions can affect peripheral nerves, including an intrinsic disorder known as lipomatosis of nerve (LN). This condition leads to massive nerve enlargement and has often been associated with nerve territory overgrowth. Although LN has been well documented as a peripheral lesion, it is uncertain whether LN can occur or extend intradurally.
   METHODS: In the present 2-part study, we searched our institutional database and the world literature to identify any case of LN occurring or extending intradurally. Strict pathognomonic imaging and histopathologic features of LN were required to be present.
   RESULTS: We did not identify any case of LN that had occurred or extended intradurally in our institution. Specifically, in our database, we found no case of intradural LN, and an evaluation of the imaging studies of proximal examples of LN did not show any extension proximal to the spinal foramen. Our literature search identified 208 reports of potential interest, of which only 3 had reported on spinal LN. Although 2 of the 3 cases showed some similarities to LN, none had demonstrated features diagnostic for LN and none had demonstrated nerve territory overgrowth. A review of 16 cases of LN in proximal locations summarized in a recently reported systematic review did not reveal any cases with LN proximal to the foramen or in an intradural location.
   CONCLUSION: A review of our institutional cases and reported cases did not show any example of LN extending or occurring intradurally. It appears that LN is a benign tumor-like nerve lesion that is without a central location, unlike more well-known tumors such as schwannomas.

AB OBJECTIVE: Supratentorial cortical ependymomas (CEs) are rare. These lesions, selectively occurring in the superficial cortex, have not been fully characterized. We analyzed the clinicopathological and genetic features of CEs.
   METHODS: Eight patients with CEs from our institution and 84 other reported CE cases were included in the present study. We retrospectively reviewed their clinical characteristics, imaging findings, treatment methods, pathological features, molecular status, and clinical outcomes.
   RESULTS: The median age at diagnosis of our 8 patients was 7.5 years. The mean tumor diameter was 70 mm. All the tumors had a cystic appearance, and calcification was observed in 6. Gross total resection was achieved in 6 patients and subtotal resection in 2 patients. Of the 8 tumors, 7 were World Health Organization grade III and 1 was World Health Organization grade II. Six tumors were immunopositive for L1 cell adhesion molecule (L1CAM). We investigated the presence of C11orf95-RELA fusion in 5 patients, all of whom exhibited it. Postoperative radiotherapy was performed for all patients with grade III tumors, except for children aged <3 years. Although 4 patients developed recurrence, all were alive throughout the follow-up period. Compared with previously reported CEs, our patients were younger and had larger tumors; however, the clinical outcomes did not differ significantly.
   CONCLUSIONS: Although most CEs in our group were immunopositive for L1CAM and showed C11orf95-RELA fusion, which have been associated with a poor prognosis in supratentorial ependymomas, all our patients had good outcomes. Gross total resection and adjuvant radiotherapy contributed to the relatively favorable prognosis of CEs compared with other supratentorial ependymomas.

AB BACKGROUND: Cervical spine immobilization, including cervical collars, has been recommended in most trauma guidelines. However, cervical spine immobilization can be associated with harm, and an increasing body of evidence has demonstrated associated complications. We hypothesized that older trauma patients placed in cervical collars for >24 hours were at greater risk of developing collar-related complications compared with those placed in cervical collars for <= 24 hours.
   METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of injured patients without a fracture of the cervical vertebrae, aged >= 65 years, who had been placed in a cervical collar during the period from January 1, 2015 to December 31, 2015. The primary outcome was the composite of the in-hospital development of nosocomial pneumonia and collar-related pressure ulcers.
   RESULTS: A total of 1154 patients had been treated with cervical collars during the study period, and 61 (5.1%) had developed collar-related complications. Male sex, a lower initial Glasgow Coma Scale score, a history of congestive heart failure, a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or asthma, operative management, and longer hospital and intensive care unit lengths of stay demonstrated a univariable association with collar-related complications (P < 0.10), in addition to a duration in the collar for >24 hours. An independent association was found between collar duration >24 hours and the outcome of interest (adjusted odds ratio, 2.50; 95% confidence interval, 1.16-5.39; P = 0.02).
   CONCLUSIONS: Among older patients without a cervical vertebral fracture, duration of cervical collar use for >24 hours was associated with the development of collar-related complications. We recommend attention to early collar clearance for older trauma patients.

AB OBJECTIVE: Early brain injury after subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), which is considered a main factor leading to poor outcome, is believed to be caused by the increase of intracranial pressure (ICP) and/or the presence of subarachnoid blood clots (SBC) itself. The purpose of this study was to examine whether ICP or SBC is more important to neurologic deficit in the presence of apoptosis or edema.
   METHODS: A total of 50 rats were allocated to 3 groups: an endovascular perforation SAH model (the SAH group), a cisterna magna saline injection model (the saline injection group), and a cisterna magna sham injection model (the sham injection group). Statistical analysis of correlations among the ICP, the grade of clot volume, neuronal apoptosis, brain water content (brain edema), and neurologic deficit was performed.
   RESULTS: In the SAH group, each of increased ICP and clot volume was correlated with neuronal apoptosis and brain edema. In the saline injection group, increased ICP was associated with apoptosis, but it did not correlate with brain edema. Neuronal apoptosis (r = 0.75; P < 0.01) and brain edema (r = 0.89; P < 0.01) correlated independently with neurologic deficit in the SAH group.
   CONCLUSIONS: The present study suggests that neuronal apoptosis is caused mainly by increased ICP, whereas brain edema is induced by SBC, and increased ICP could aggravate it in the presence of SBC. Brain edema could affect neurologic deficit, but apoptosis alone may be less influential. Not only ICP but also SBC seem important for brain damage in the acute stage of SAH.

AB BACKGROUND: Clinical examination, including preand postoperative assessment of olfaction function, should be included in evaluating surgical outcomes in patients with pituitary adenomas. Most of the studies are lacking assessment of olfactory function.
   METHODS: A prospective study of 143 patients who underwent surgical resection of pituitary adenomas from January 2014 to December 2017 was performed. Data on clinical presentation, pre-and postoperative neurologic, endocrinologic, and ophthalmologic examinations, complications, and follow-up outpatient examinations were recorded. Olfactory function was assessed using the Sniffin' Sticks odor identification test preoperatively, postoperatively (3 months), and 1 year after surgery.
   RESULTS: Normosmia was present preoperatively in 93.7% of patients, postoperatively in 95.8% of patients, and in 95.1% 1 year postsurgery. Hyposmia was present preoperatively in 4.2% of patients, postoperatively in 2.1% of patients, and in 1.4% 1 year after surgery. Anosmia was present preoperatively in 2.1% of patients, postoperatively in 2.1% of patients, and in 3.5% 1 year after surgery. In patients with preoperative normosmia, postoperative hyposmia and anosmia were present in 1.5% of patients. There were no differences according to age, sex, size, or type of pituitary adenoma.
   CONCLUSIONS: Assessment of olfactory function should be included in the analysis of pituitary adenoma surgery results. This prospective study showed low risk of olfaction deterioration if an endoscopic endonasal approach is used without any mucosal flaps for skull base reconstruction. Further studies that include objective olfaction assessment are warranted.

TI Psychosocial Stress Reactivity as Predictor of Operative Outcome in

AB BACKGROUND: A large proportion of the population suffers from chronic back pain. For optimal treatment, the question arises which patients would benefit from conservative therapy and for whom lumbar disc surgery is most appropriate. It seems reasonable to analyze the impact of paraclinical parameters on the operation outcome to identify patients who would benefit less from surgery or need special pre-/postoperative medical care.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: From March 2012 to July 2014, 32 patients were treated via microscopically supported interlaminar fenestration and discectomy at the Department of Neurosurgery, University Hospital Carl Gustav Carus Dresden. One day before the operation, a cortisol survey was made during the stress response of the Trier Social Stress Test. At the same time, a survey of relevant questionnaires was conducted by which the postoperative symptom experience was made operational and comparable with the evaluation of the same information thirty days afterwards.
   RESULTS: It could be shown that there is a connection between cortisol reactivity and the pain burden following operations. Patients with a greater cortisol reaction under stress exposition partially experienced more intense postoperative pain than the patients with a lower cortisol reaction. However, this relationship could only be explained by single significant results, whereas further calculations could not produce any significance.
   CONCLUSIONS: Cortisol reactivity seems to be associated with pain development. The inconsistent findings in empiricism as well as in this investigation are indicative of a complex association of postoperative pain and cortisol reactivity, which needs to be examined further.

TI Social Media Use for Professional Purposes in the Neurosurgical
   Community: A Multi-Institutional Study
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
LA English
DT Article
DE Neurosurgery; Outreach; Social media
AB BACKGROUND: Since the debut of Facebook in 2004, social media (SoMe) has garnered increased popularity and usage worldwide. Given its appeal and visibility, many industries have used SoMe to promote products for professional purposes. Specialized sites have subsequently been created to connect users in similar disciplines. Although SoMe sites have amassed over 1-billion followers, SoMe usage in the neurosurgical community has not yet been well described.
   METHODS: We present an online survey administered to neurosurgery faculty, fellows, and residents in 102 U.S. accredited programs to gauge usage and perception of SoMe for professional purposes.
   RESULTS: Of all surveys distributed, 241 neurosurgeons responded with an attending, resident, to fellow breakdown of 137, 96, and 8, respectively. A total of 55.97% of respondents were under the age of 34, 2% were over the age of 75, and 81% of respondents identified as men. An overwhelming majority cited conferences (83%) and in-person meetings as their preferred method of networking. However, 70% state they use SoMe for professional purposes with Doximity and LinkdIn listed as the most popular (49% and 48%, respectively) platforms. Lack of time and perceived value, in addition to privacy concerns, were noted to be the main factors for those refraining from SoMe use.
   CONCLUSIONS: As SoMe becomes increasingly popular and its use expands, the majority of neurosurgeon respondents are also using SoMe for professional purposes. Although lack of time, lack of perceived value, and privacy concerns were hindrances to usage, other factors like age do not seem to correlate with SoMe adoption for professional aims.

ID SPINAL-CORD; DURAL SAC; LEVEL; PARAGANGLIOMA
AB BACKGROUND: The intradural filum terminale (iFT) connects the conus medullaris (CM) with the dural sac (DS), and the extradural filum terminale (eFT) connects the DS to the coccyx. The aim of the present study was to update the description of the FT and integrate these data in a physiological and pathological context.
   METHODS: Anatomical measurements and histological investigations were performed on 10 human cadavers.
   RESULTS: The mean length of the iFT and eFT was 167.13 and 87.59 mm, respectively. The mean cranial diameter of the iFT was 1.84 mm. It was >2 mm in 2 specimens. The mean half and caudal diameter of the iFT was 0.71 and 0.74 mm, respectively. The cranial diameter of the eFT correlated with the caudal diameter of the eFT (rho = 0.94; P = 0.02). The level of the CMeiFT junction correlated significantly with the iFT length (rho = -0.67; P = 0.03). The mobilization of the iFT was not transmitted to the extradural elements and vice versa. The iFT contained axons and ependymal cells, which were dense in the first third and then randomly arranged caudally in islets. This could explain why ependymomas can occur all along the iFT. Ganglion cells were abundant around the junction with the DS. The eFT contained smooth muscle cells, adipocytes, and axons. A mechanoreceptor was identified in 1 specimen.
   CONCLUSIONS: Consistently with their common embryological origin, a real anatomical and histological continuum is present between the CM and FT. The FT should, therefore, no longer be considered a simple ligament but, rather, a complex fibrocellular structure.

AB OBJECTIVE: The aims of this study were to evaluate the risk factors for muscle injury in patients undergoing posterior lumbar spinal surgery and the clearance of postoperative biochemical changes following lumbar fusion and secondarily to evaluate the timing for monitoring postoperative biochemical serum levels and potential clinical correlation.
   METHODS: The study prospectively enrolled 39 patients with degenerative disease of the lumbar spine. Biochemical markers (creatine phosphokinase [CPK], creatinine, and hemoglobin) were analyzed in 5 predefined stages. All relevant clinical data were collected. Rhabdomyolysis (RML) was defined as a postoperative 5-fold increase of the baseline CPK value.
   RESULTS: Patients from the lumbar fusion group had the highest postoperative CPK ratio. Overall, the rate of RML was 43.6%. CPK and creatinine activity reached their maximum on the first postoperative day in 69.2% and 87.5% of patients, respectively. Lumbar fusion (P = 0.005), surgical time >270 minutes (P = 0.028), and fall in hemoglobin levels >3 g/dL (P = 0.034) were identified as independent factors associated with higher risk of RML.
   CONCLUSIONS: The risk of RML increases with prolonged and invasive surgery with higher bleeding potential. Knowing the clearance of postoperative biochemical changes permits a standardized strategy with measurements in precise intervals, thereby avoiding unnecessary costs. The clinical significance is still undetermined.

DE Bone cuts; Spinal decompression; Spine; Surgical technique
ID UNILATERAL LAMINOTOMY; STENOSIS
AB OBJECTIVE: The foundation of spine surgery centers on the proper identification, decompression, and stabilization of bony and neural elements. We describe easily reproducible and reliable methods for optimal decompression and release of neural structures to alleviate symptoms and improve patients' quality of life.
   METHODS: Multiple spinal decompression techniques were described in procedures for which the goal of surgery was decompression alone or decompression and fusion. Eight fundamental techniques were described: inverted U-cut, J-cut, T-cut, L-cut, Z-cut, I-track cuts, C-cut, and O-cut.
   RESULTS: These foundational cuts may be combined, as needed, to develop an individually tailored approach to the patient's pathology.
   CONCLUSIONS: After properly identifying the anatomic structures, each of these techniques provides a consistent, reproducible, and efficient means to decompress the spine under various circumstances. These techniques provide surgical trainees with a framework for approaching surgical decompression.

AB BACKGROUND: We evaluated the factors influencing overall survival (OS) and event-free survival (EFS) in children with atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumors (ATRTs).
   METHODS: We performed a retrospective study of children aged <16 years and tumor histological diagnosis of ATRT. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to determine the effect of individual and interdependent variables and survival.
   RESULTS: A total of 34 children had undergone surgery, with a male/female ratio of 1.8:1. On univariate analysis, the factors with statistically significant influence on OS and EFS were the extent of resection (P = 0.012 and P = 0.015, respectively), adjuvant therapy (P <= 0.001 and P = 0.001, respectively), and rhabdoid cell percentage (P = 0.004 and P = 0.005, respectively). On survival analysis, the median OS and EFS were better for those who had completed adjuvant therapy versus those who had not received adjuvant therapy (OS, 22.7 months vs. 3.5 months; EFS, 10.9 months vs. 3.5 months), those who had undergone gross total resection versus those who had undergone partial decompression (OS, 10.9 months vs. 2 months; EFS, 8.9 months vs. 2.5 months), and those with <50% rhabdoid cells in the biopsy specimen versus those with >50% rhabdoid cells (OS, 10.9 months vs. 3.7 months; EFS, 8.9 months vs. 3.5 months). On multivariate analysis, only the extent of resection and adjuvant therapy status had a significant influence on OS and EFS.
   CONCLUSION: Achieving gross total resection should be the aim of surgery, depending on the tumor location, and these children should undergo upfront adjuvant treatment.

   SURGERY; TRENDS; PROVIDER; CASELOAD
AB BACKGROUND: Evolving technologies and health care quality metrics have altered treatment algorithms for acoustic neuromas (ANs), increasing trends toward observation and radiosurgery, with proportionate declines in use of microsurgery. A correlation between increasing surgical volumes and superior outcomes has been investigated previously in numerous surgical diseases, including AN.
   OBJECTIVE: To re-evaluate the volume-outcome relationship of AN resection in a changing health care system, with evolving treatment strategies.
   METHODS: Patients who underwent AN resection between 2009 and 2013 were retrospectively identified in the State Inpatient Database subset of the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project. Generalized linear mixed-effect models were used to assess odds of various outcome measures (length of stay [LOS], discharge disposition, and facial nerve or severe clinical complications). Institutions were grouped into low-volume centers (1-6 cases/year) and high-volume centers (HVC; >= 31 cases/year) for analysis.
   RESULTS: A total of 1873 patients underwent AN resection between 2009 and 2013 with a mean age of 50.1 +/- 14.1 years (+/- standard deviation). For each additional case treated annually, patients were 2% (odds ratio [OR], 0.98; 95% confidence interval, 0.96-0.99) less likely to experience a severe complication (P = 0.004). Each additional case also trended toward a decreased rate of facial nerve complications and nonroutine discharge. Inpatient LOS was also shorter for patients at HVCs (median, 4 vs. 5 days; P < 0.001).
   CONCLUSIONS: Despite a relative decline in microsurgery compared with previous eras, care at HVCs is still associated with superior short-term outcomes, such as decreased LOS, facial nerve or other severe complications, and nonroutine discharges.

AB OBJECTIVE: Hyponatremia has been frequently observed after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), and some data have suggested a correlation with symptomatic cerebral vasospasm and poor outcomes. The present prospective study investigated sodium and water disturbances after aneurysmal SAH with regard to symptomatic vasospasm and patient outcomes. -
   METHODS: Data from all patients with aneurysmal SAH treated in our department during a 2-year period were collected. Daily natriuresis, sodium levels, water balance, and serum and urine osmolality were measured at 4 different points: day 1 of admission or bleeding, day 3, day 7, and day 14-21 or discharge. The clinical parameters (i.e., Hunt and Hess grade, aneurysm location and treatment, onset of vasospasm) were reviewed. The patients' outcome was assessed using the Glasgow outcome score and modified Rankin scale.
   RESULTS: A total of 101 patients (70 women; median age, 52 years) were enrolled in the present study. Of these 101 patients, 59.4% had a good grade SAH (Hunt and Hess grade 1-3). The most common aneurysm location was the anterior communicating artery (37%). The results from an electrolyte analysis were available for <= 91 patients at days 1 and 78 at discharge. In 33 patients (32.7%), hyponatremia had been diagnosed at any time point. Hyponatremia was most frequently observed at day 1 and later at days 7-10. A location in the anterior communicating artery resulted in hyponatremia more frequently only at day 1 (P = 0.007). The main causes of hyponatremia were cerebral salt-wasting syndrome (early onset) and syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (early and late onset).
   CONCLUSION: Distinguishing early-and late-onset hyponatremia is of major relevance, because different therapeutic approaches are required. Only hyponatremia at discharge resulted in less favorable outcomes.

AB OBJECTIVE: The diagnosis and timely treatment of shunt infections (SI) in children is of paramount importance. In some cases, the standard cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) variables will not be sufficient for an accurate diagnosis of SI. CSF lactate (LCSF) has been found to assist in differentiating bacterial from nonbacterial meningitis in non-neurosurgical patients. To the best of our knowledge, the use of lactate in diagnosing or confirming the presence of SI has not yet been discussed. The goal of the present study was to describe the role of LCSF levels in children with shunts and Ommaya reservoirs and to evaluate its role in the accurate diagnosis of shunt-related infection.
   METHODS: We retrospectively collected data for a consecutive series of pediatric patients treated at a large tertiary pediatric neurosurgical department, for whom CSF samples from shunts had been collected during a 2-year period (2016-2017). The lactate levels were correlated with the presence of SI.
   RESULTS: A total of 61 CSF samples were analyzed, with 6 SIs found. The LCSF levels and white blood cell count were both found to correlate with the presence of CSF infections. A cutoff value of >= 2.95 mmol/L reached a sensitivity of 83%, specificity of 83%, and positive predictive value of 50%. LCSF <2.95 mmol/L had a negative predictive value of 96%.
   CONCLUSIONS: LCSF levels can be used as an additional chemical marker for the diagnosis and confirmation of SIs. An LCSF value of <2.95 mmol/L had a high negative predictive value.

AB OBJECTIVE: The present study examined the differences in outcomes of cervical spinal surgery for patients with and without a major psychiatric comorbidity using the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project National Inpatient Sample database.
   METHODS: Data were queried from the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project National Inpatient Sample database from 2013 to 2014 for hospitalizations with a major psychiatric comorbidity and a diagnosis of cervical spondylotic myelopathy treated by an appropriate surgical procedure. The included psychiatric comorbidities were schizophrenia, episodic mood disorders (bipolar I and II disorders), delusional disorders, and psychoses not otherwise specified. Univariate and multivariate regression analyses were performed to determine the differences in outcomes between patients with and without a major psychiatric comorbidity.
   RESULTS: A total of 18,335 hospitalizations met the inclusion criteria, of which 648 (3.5%) included a major psychiatric comorbidity. Multivariate regression analysis demonstrated that psychiatric comorbidity was an independent predictor of nonehome discharge (odds ratio [OR], 1.81; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.43-2.30; P < 0.0001) and a longer hospital stay (+0.52 day; 95% CI, 0.43-0.61; P < 0.0001) but was not an independent predictor of overall complications (OR, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.58-1.07; P = 0.13) or total hospital charges ($1992; 95% CI, -$917-$4902; P = 0.18).
   CONCLUSIONS: Psychiatric comorbidity was associated with an increased risk of nonehome discharge and a longer length of stay for patients undergoing surgical intervention for cervical myelopathy. However, we did not find an associated increased risk of in-hospital mortality, complications, or total hospital charges. Psychiatric comorbidity should not be weighed against patients who require surgical treatment for cervical spondylotic myelopathy, and special attention should be given to postoperative care and discharge planning for this unique patient population.

AB OBJECTIVE: Lateral lumbar interbody fusion (LLIF) at the L4-L5 level is a controversial topic in the spine data. The aim of the present study was to compare the rate of nerve-related motor deficits in patients undergoing LLIF with and without L4-L5 involvement.
   METHODS: The clinical data from consecutive patients who had undergone LLIF from 2006 to 2016 at a single academic institution were retrospectively reviewed for new postoperative motor weakness of the quadriceps or tibialis anterior muscle. The patients were divided into 2 groups according to L4-L5 involvement. Regression analysis was performed to examine the association of LLIF at L4-L5 and the risk of new motor deficits.
   RESULTS: A total of 872 patients met inclusion criteria. The rate of new motor deficits at the 6-week postoperative visit in the L4-L5 group was 13.1%, which was significantly greater than that in the non-L4-L5 group at 5.5% (P < 0.001). After adjustment for potential confounders in multivariate logistic regression models, L4-L5 was still significantly associated with an increased risk of new motor deficit (odds ratio, 2.290; P = 0.008). Of the 686 patients with a minimum follow-up of 6 months, persistent nerve-related motor deficits at the last follow-up examination were recorded in 2.5% of the L4-L5 group and 0.4% of the none L4-L5 group (P = 0.065).
   CONCLUSIONS: The results from the present large study are in line with previous investigations reporting an initial increased risk of new motor deficits for LLIF performed at L4-L5. However, most new motor deficits were transient in nature and had resolved over time.

   Overlooked Aspect
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
LA English
DT Article
DE Bone flap; Cosmetic outcome; Cranioplasty; Decompressive craniectomy
ID HEMICRANIECTOMY
AB BACKGROUND: Cranioplasty (CP) is an obligatory surgery after decompressive craniectomy (DC). The primary objective is to protect the brain from external injury and prevent syndrome of trephined. In a government hospital, such cases pose a significant burden to a trauma center. Because of this reason, cosmetic outcome is never taken into account for the CP. We present results of CP performed at our hospital.
   METHODS: This is a retrospective review of the cases of CP performed over the past 3 years at our hospital. The cosmetic outcome was divided into 3 grades: 1-good symmetrical, 2-irregularities, 2a-elevated and 2b depressed, and 3-bad cosmetic outcome requiring reoperation.
   RESULTS: A total of 133 patients with acute brain injury underwent CP during the study period. The outcome was good in 74 (55.6%) and bad, requiring reoperation, in 2 (1.5%) cases. Various types of the CP materials like autologous bone flap, titanium mesh, and customized titanium plates were used. Methods of fixation were threads or miniplates and screws. In univariate analysis, cerebral venous thrombosis as an indication for DC, use of autologous bone flap, and fixation with thread were associated with poor outcome. However, in multivariate analysis only the method of implant fixation was associated with poor outcome. It was found that if screws and plates are used for fixation of bone flap, the chances of bad outcome are reduced by 74.6%.
   CONCLUSIONS: The cosmetic outcome is overlooked for CP. The bone flap fixation has to be rigid for a good outcome.

AB BACKGROUND: The adoption of endovascular techniques for treatment of pericallosal artery aneurysms (PAAs) has been comparatively gradual due to anatomic and technological factors. We conducted a retrospective cohort study to evaluate the outcomes of PAA treatment with coiling and flow diversion at our institution.
   METHODS: This was a retrospective study of patients treated endovascularly for PAAs from December 2007 to January 2019.
   RESULTS: In total, 33 patients with 34 aneurysms were included (25 aneurysms ruptured, 9 unruptured or recurrent). Of the ruptured group, 22 were coiled (88%) and rest treated with flow diversion. Initial angiographic follow up rate was 72%, at median of 159 days. Overall recurrence rate was 40% (10/25) at median of 376 days, all among coiled aneurysms. 6 recurrent aneurysms were retreated with further coiling (2) and flow diversion (4). Of the unruptured/recurrent group, 5 were coiled (55%) and remainder treated with flow diversion. Angiographic follow-up rate was 100% at median of 267 days. Recurrence rate was 22% (2/9), both in coiled aneurysms. Overall, 27 aneurysms were coiled, 9 treated with flow diversion and 3 with "partial" flow diversion. All aneurysms treated with pipeline flow diversion achieved 100% occlusion. No re-rupture or new rupture was observed. Good clinical outcome (modified Rankin Scale 0-2) was seen in 79% of patients.
   CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrates that endovascular coiling for PAAs is associated with a definite rate of recurrence, which has to be monitored with timely angiography. We also demonstrate the excellent effectiveness of flow diversion for PAAs with either presentation.

ID RISK-FACTORS; PERIOPERATIVE MANAGEMENT; INTRACRANIAL HEMORRHAGE;
   ANTIPLATELET AGENTS; COAGULATION
AB BACKGROUND: An appropriate time (5-7 days) of discontinuation of low-dose acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) in patients undergoing surgery for chronic subdural hematoma (CSDH) is recommended. However, patient clinical deterioration often does not allow to wait the recommended time for surgery. Clear guidelines regarding the perioperative management of patients with ASA therapy are still lacking. The aim of this study is to compare the surgical outcome, complications, and mortality of patients suffering from CSDHs who underwent urgent surgery or before and after 5 days of discontinuation of low-dose ASA.
   METHODS: A retrospective 3-center study included patients treated for CSDH taking low-dose ASA. Aspirin was discontinued on hospital admission. Based on the timing of discontinuation, we classified patients in 3 groups: urgent (surgery at admission), surgery within 5 days, and surgery 5 days after discontinuation. Surgery consisted of minicraniotomy or burr holes. Variables analyzed were age, comorbidities, modified Rankin Scale, complications, rebleedings, and mortality. Outcome measures were acute rebleeding requiring surgery, recurrence, mortality, complications, and clinical conditions. The chi(2) test and the Fisher exact test were used to compare variables. Logistic regression analysis was used for defining the impact on outcome measures.
   RESULTS: We enrolled 164 patients. After aspirin discontinuation, patients underwent surgery: on admission (69 cases [42.1%]), within 5 days (59 patients [36%]), and after 5 days (36 cases [22%]). No correlation was observed between time of discontinuation and outcome measures, including having a worse clinical outcome.
   CONCLUSIONS: Our data showed that the time of discontinuation of ASA does not influence outcome.

   THERAPY; KIDNEY
AB BACKGROUND: After aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH), crystalloid fluids with a relatively high sodium concentration have been used to maintain the cerebral blood flow. However, the prophylactic delivery of water and sodium by intravenous (IV) infusion will not necessarily improve the prognosis of patients after aSAH, and the excessive supply of water and sodium can negatively affect the outcome. We hypothesized that the delivery of an optimal amount of water and sodium separately might improve the outcome after aSAH.
   METHODS: We recruited 55 consecutive patients who had undergone clipping or endovascular coil embolization after aSAH. Group 1 (n = 33) received conventional therapy (i.e., prophylactic IV sodium and water = protocol 1]). Group 2 (n = 22) received the optimal amount of water and sodium separately (protocol 2).
   RESULTS: The median total of water and sodium chloride supplied in group 1 was significantly greater than that supplied in group 2 (P < 0.01). The modified Rankin scale score at discharge was 0-2 in 15 patients (95%) in group 2 and 23 patients (55%) in group 1 (P < 0.001). On multivariate logistic regression analysis, the odds ratio for a discharge modified Rankin scale score of 0-2 or 3-6 was significantly associated with the treatment protocol (P < 0.05) and the net fluid balance on days 4-8 (P < 0.05).
   CONCLUSION: The separate delivery of optimal amounts of water and sodium could be a promising therapeutic strategy to improve the prognosis after aSAH.

TI Impact of Integral Dose on the Maintenance of Pain Relief in Patients

DT Article
DE Gamma knife radiosurgery; Integral dose; Stereotactic radiosurgery;

ID STEREOTACTIC RADIOSURGERY
AB BACKGROUND: Integral dose (ID) defined as the product of mean dose and target volume, is a measure of the absorbed radiation energy.
   OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of ID on the duration of pain relief after primary Gamma knife stereotactic radiosurgery (GKSRS) in trigeminal neuralgia.
   PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 78 patients who achieved initial pain response of I-III on the Barrow Neurological Institute Pain Scale (BNI-PS) following primary GKSRS for idiopathic trigeminal neuralgia were included in this study. A Cox regression model was used to compute the prognostic factor with respect to the ID within the 50% isodose line. Facial pain relief maintenance interval was defined as time interval between the day of improved BNI-PS grade and pain level back to the BNI-PS IV or V. The median duration of follow-up was 42 months (range 6-108 months).
   RESULTS: After the initial GKSRS, patients achieved pain relief at a median of 0.5 months (range, 7 days to 6 months); 28 patients developed recurrence of pain. There was a positive correlation between the pain relief maintenance and increasing ID within 50% isodose line (hazard ratio 1.85, P = 0.04) on multivariable Cox-regression analysis. Using logistic regression analysis, we found that ID was not predictive of developing post-stereotactic radiosurgery hypoesthesia (P = 0.64, hazard ratio 1.057).
   CONCLUSIONS: Stereotactic radiosurgery can be individualized based on trigeminal nerve morphology to achieve durable pain relief in patients with trigeminal neuralgia. ID calculation aids in planning an optimal radiation dose based on the nerve morphology to provide durable pain relief of idiopathic trigeminal neuralgia.

AB BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to determine the number of cases needed to achieve the level of competence for percutaneous endoscopic lumbar diskectomy (PELD) via the bi-needle technique using the cumulative summation test for learning curve (LC-CUSUM).
   METHODS:A retrospective design was used. We included 60 patients who underwent a single-level PELD via the bi-needle technique performed by a single surgeon. The surgeon had 5 years of experience in open surgery including the transforaminal endoscopic spine system and Yeung endoscopic spine system but no experience in the bi-needle technique. Surgery success was defined as an operative time <60 minutes, and the acceptable procedure was completed within 3 times of C-arm fluoroscopies. The LC-CUSUM was used to analyze the data.
   RESULTS: The average operative time for PELD via the bi-needle technique was 58.3 +/- 12.4 minutes. The mean operative time was 65.7 +/- 12.1 minutes in the early learning period (30 cases) and 51.0 +/- 7.5 minutes in the late learning period (30 cases) (P < 0.05). On the basis of the evaluation indexes of the operative time and radioactive exposure, the LC-CUSUM signaled proficiency for the bi-needle technique at the 50th-54th operation. Seven cases of complications were observed during the whole learning process, with 6 in the early period and 1 in the late period (P < 0.05).
   CONCLUSIONS: The novel bi-needle technique is safe and effective for PELD with appropriate patients, and the learning curve is acceptable. A substantial learning period (50-54 cases) is needed before a spine surgeon can master the bi-needle technique.

TI Vacuum Facet Phenomenon in Computed Tomography Imaging: A Sign of
   Instability in Degenerative Spondylolisthesis?
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
LA English
DT Article
DE Degenerative spondylolisthesis; Lumbar facet joint; Lumbar instability;
   Vacuum phenomenon
AB OBJECTIVE: The aim of the present study was to investigate the relationship between vacuum facet phenomena and lumbar instability in patients with degenerative spondylolisthesis (DS) in L4-L5.
   METHODS: Patients with L4-L5 DS who had both lumbosacral flexion-extension radiographs and computed tomography (CT) scans available for review from January 2016 to December 2017 were eligible for the present study. The dynamic motion index (DMI) of each patient was used to represent the percentage of slippage of L-L4 on the L5 vertebral disks on the flexion radiographs minus the percentage on the extension radiographs. The facet vacuum index refers to the average width of the facet vacuum on the left and right sides.
   RESULTS: A total of 67 patients with L4-L5 DS were included in the present study. Of the 67 patients, 35 had a vacuum facet phenomenon on their CTscan and 32 patients did not. The incidence of lumbar instability in the patients with a vacuum facet phenomenon was significantly greater than that in the patients without a vacuum facet phenomenon (P = 0.015). The mean DMI for the patients with a vacuum facet phenomenon was significantly greater than that for the patients without a vacuum facet phenomenon (P < 0.001). A positive linear correlation was found between the facet vacuum index and DMI for patients with a vacuum facet phenomenon (Pearson correlation coefficient, 0.597; P < 0.001).
   CONCLUSIONS: A linear correlation was found between the degree of segmental motion and the width of the vacuum facet phenomenon in patients with DS at L4-L5. Our study has shown that vacuum facet phenomena detected on the CT images of patients with DS are highly predictive of segmental instability.

TI Abnormal Embryonic Development of Cerebral Arteries as a Potential Cause
   of Moyamoya Disease
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
LA English
DT Article
DE Cerebral artery development; Embryology; Moyamoya disease
AB OBJECTIVE: Moyamoya disease (MMD) is a cerebrovascular disorder, currently defined as progressive stenosis of intracranial internal carotid artery and its main branches with secondary formation of netlike vessels. Its precise formation mechanism, however, is unknown. We propose that MMD is caused by abnormal embryonic development of the cerebral arteries and also propose a mechanism for MMD formation.
   METHODS: The anterior, middle, and posterior cerebral arteries, anterior choroidal arteries (AChoA) and posterior choroidal arteries, and posterior corpus callosum arteries were analyzed separately for each patient with MMD to determine whether the arteries exhibited the following characteristics, which we regarded as remnants of primitive vessels: 1) plexiform arteries rather than normal artery trunks; 2) clustered arteries converging at locations of normal artery trunks; and 3) dilated AChoA.
   RESULTS: We retrospectively analyzed 39 consecutive patients with MMD, of whom 30 had anterior cerebral arteries, 31 middle cerebral arteries, 10 posterior cerebral arteries, 30 AChoAs, 18 posterior choroidal arteries, and 20 posterior corpus callosum arteries and had the characteristics of primitive vessel remnants. Altogether, 82.05% of the patients had the remnants of primitive vessels.
   CONCLUSIONS: MMD is more likely to be caused by abnormalities of cerebral artery development, which mainly occur in the embryonic period or postnatally. The abnormality developing processes include sprouting angiogenesis, vessel fusion, and pruning, which primarily affect cranial ramus of primitive internal carotid artery, may occasionally affect the caudal ramus of the primitive internal carotid artery, and rarely affect the vertebrobasilar artery system. So-called moyamoya vessels comprise un-fused primitive small vessels; to compensate, enlarged AChoAs remain undegenerated but are not dilated.

   PLACEMENT
AB BACKGROUND: A number of randomized controlled trials have shown the benefit of drain placement in the operative treatment of chronic subdural hematoma (CSDH); however, few reports have described real-life results after adoption of drain placement into clinical practice. We report the results following a change in practice at Helsinki University Hospital from no drain to subdural drain (SD) placement after burr hole craniostomy for CSDH.
   METHODS: We conducted a retrospective observational study of consecutive patients undergoing burr hole craniostomy for CSDH. We compared outcomes between a 6-month period when SD placement was arbitrary (Julye December 2015) and a period when SD placement for 48 hours was routine (July-December 2017). Our primary outcome of interest was recurrence of CSDH necessitating reoperation within 6 months. Patient outcomes, infections, and other complications were assessed as well.
   RESULTS: A total of 161 patients were included, comprising 71 (44%) in the drain group and 90 (56%) in the non-drain group. There were no significant differences in age, comorbidities, history of trauma, or use of antithrombotic agents between the 2 groups (P > 0.05 for all). Recurrence within 6 months occurred in 18% of patients in the non-drain group, compared with 6% in the drain group (odds ratio, 0.28; 95% confidence interval, 0.09-0.87; P = 0.028). There were no differences in neurologic outcomes (P = 0.72), mortality (P = 0.55), infection rate (P = 0.96), or other complications (P = 0.20).
   CONCLUSIONS: The change in practice from no drain to use of an SD after burr hole craniostomy for CSDH effectively reduced the 6-month recurrence rate with no effect on patient outcomes, infections, or other complications.

AB BACKGROUND: Vestibular schwannomas (VS) are benign intracranial neoplasms arising from the eighth cranial nerve for which targeted radiation therapy (RT) has proved increasingly successful. However, long-term hearing and related cranial nerve outcomes have been disputed for the 3 current RT modalities.
   OBJECTIVE: To determine differences in hearing preservation for patients treated with stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS), fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy (FSRT), or hypofractionated stereotactic radiotherapy (hypoFSRT) for VS.
   METHODS: A retrospective electronic chart review was conducted for all patients with unilateral VS treated with primary RT at a single academic medical center between 2000 and 2017. The primary outcome measure was preservation of serviceable hearing status in the affected ear at last follow-up. Secondary outcomes included tinnitus, vertigo, and imbalance.
   RESULTS: A total of 33 FSRT cases, 21 SRS cases, and 6 hypoFSRT cases were identified. Postoperative deterioration in serviceable hearing and tinnitus showed significant differences across cohorts. The SRS cohort had a higher baseline incidence of nonserviceable hearing and disequilibrium compared with other cohorts before RT (P = 0.001 and 0.022, respectively); no differences in baseline morbidity were observed for vertigo and tinnitus. The 5-year tumor control rate was 95.2%, 93.9%, and 100% with SRS, FSRT, and hypoFSRT, respectively.
   CONCLUSIONS: Our series indicated an excellent tumor control rate in all the modalities. Our SRS cohort showed increased incidence and shorter time to hearing deterioration compared with the FSRT and hypoFSRT cohorts. The FSRT and hypoFSRT cohorts have shown comparable overall outcomes. Onset of post-RT tinnitus was observed only with FSRT.

TI Risk Factors for Postoperative Intracranial Hemorrhage After Resection
   of Intracranial Tumor in 2259 Consecutive Patients
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
LA English
DT Article
DE Age; International normalized ratio; Intracranial tumor; Postoperative
   hemorrhage; Tumor size
ID CHRONIC SUBDURAL-HEMATOMA; RECURRENCE; SURGERY; POSTURE
AB BACKGROUND: Postoperative hemorrhage (POH), an uncommon complication after cranial operation, may result in prolonged postoperative hospitalization, severe neurologic impairment, or even death. Most models in studies detecting risk factors for POH include all kinds of cranial lesions; however, factors associated with POH may vary among intracranial diseases. There is a paucity of large sample studies focusing solely on POH after intracranial tumor surgery. Therefore, this study was designed to investigate the preoperative risk factors for POH after surgery for intracranial tumor.
   METHODS: Medical records of 2259 adult patients who underwent primary surgical resection of single intracranial tumor between January 2017 and June 2018 at West China Hospital of Sichuan University were retrospectively studied. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to identify the risk factors for POH after resection of intracranial tumor.
   RESULTS: POH (defined as postoperative hematoma requiring surgical evacuation) occurred in 40 of 2259 patients (1.8%). Univariate analysis revealed that older age (P = 0.037, Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test), higher international normalized ratio (INR) (P = 0.037, Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test), and larger tumor size (P = 0.001, Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test) were significantly associated with POH. Then it was confirmed by multivariate analysis that all of the 3 factors (older age: P = 0.033, higher INR: P = 0.044, larger tumor size: P = 0.002) were independent risk factors for POH after removal of intracranial tumor.
   CONCLUSIONS: Older age, higher INR, and larger tumor size were identified as independent risk factors for POH after resection of intracranial tumor in adults.

TI Morphologic Parameters and Location Associated with Rupture Status of

LA English
DT Article
DE Aspect ratio; Elderly population; Intracranial aneurysms; Shape; Size
   ratio; Undulation index
ID ASPECT RATIO; CEREBRAL ANEURYSMS; SIZE RATIO; RISK; SHAPE
AB BACKGROUND: Treatment of unruptured intracranial aneurysms (IAs) in elderly patients is associated with a high risk of morbidity and mortality, necessitating a thorough understanding of the potential rupture risk. The aim of this study was to identify morphologic parameters and anatomic locations that could discriminate ruptured IAs in patients >= 70 years old.
   METHODS: Retrospective analysis was performed of three-dimensional angiograms and medical records of 344 patients with 411 saccular IAs. Patients >= 70 years old were defined as elderly. IAs were subdivided into ruptured and unruptured. Morphologic parameters and anatomic locations were compared in elderly and younger (<70 years old) patients with ruptured and unruptured IAs.
   RESULTS: The study included 266 patients <70 years old and 78 patients >= 70 years old with 411 aneurysms (102 ruptured and 309 unruptured). In the elderly group, 22 of 95 aneurysms were ruptured (23.15%) compared with 80 of 316 (25.3%) in the younger group. Size ratio and aspect ratio were higher in ruptured IAs, but only in the younger group. Undulation index, indicating IA shape irregularity, was significantly different between ruptured and unruptured IAs in younger and elderly groups. The only variables associated with rupture in the elderly group were undulation index (0.11 +/- 0.07 vs. 0.07 +/- 0.06, P = 0.02) and location (P = 0.001).
   CONCLUSIONS: Aneurysm size, size ratio, and aspect ratio may not be reliable discriminants of rupture in elderly patients. Unruptured IAs in elderly patients should be evaluated on the basis of shape irregularity and anatomic location.

TI Visualization of Dark Side of Skull Base with Surgical Navigation and

AB BACKGROUND: Lesions located at the petrous apex, cavernous sinus, clivus, medial aspect of the jugular foramen, or condylar regions are still difficult to fully expose using the operating microscope. Although approaches to this region through the middle cranial fossa have been previously described, these approaches afford only limited visualization. We have confirmed a transcranial infratemporal fossa combined microsurgical and endoscopic access to the petrous apex, clivus, medial aspect of the jugular foramen, and occipital condyle. We have presented the results of a micro-anatomical cadaver dissection study and its clinical application.
   METHODS: Ten latex-injected cadaveric specimens (20 twenty sides) underwent dissection with navigational guidance to achieve an extended anterior petrosal approach combined with a far vidian corridor approach (between the foramen rotundum and foramen ovale). We performed anatomical dissections to confirm the surgical anatomy and the feasibility and limitations of this approach. Anatomical dissections were performed in the skull base laboratory of Lariboisiere Hospital and Duke University Medical Center. This approach was then applied to some clinical cases.
   RESULTS: The combination of the microscope and endoscope, aided by surgical navigation, was extremely effective and provided a wide view of the petrous rhomboid, the entire clivus, and the medial condylar regions. The extended extradural anterior petrosal approach provided a large corridor to petrous and clival lesions. Endoscopic assistance allows for wide and deep exposure of the middle to lower clivus, epipharyngeal space, and bilateral condylar regions. This approach successfully provided adequate surgical access for resection of tumors located in these regions. The depth of the medial aspect of the jugular foramen was 16.3 +/- 1.2 mm deep from the geniculate ganglion. The emerging point of the inferior petrosal sinus in the jugular foramen was 16.5 +/- 1.8 mm deep from the geniculate ganglion. The hypoglossal canal was 21.6 +/- 2.2 mm deep from the geniculate ganglion. The foramen magnum was located 31.5 +/- 2.4 mm deep from the gasserian ganglion. The inferior petrosal sinus was found to be a reliable landmark to identify the medial portion of the jugular bulb. The introduction of the endoscope through the middle fossa rhomboid enabled visualization of the medial aspect of the jugular bulb, which otherwise would be hampered by the internal auditory canal under the microscope.
   CONCLUSION: After microscopic exposure of the middle fossa rhomboid, neuronavigational endoscopic assistance facilitated visualization of the ventral cavernous region, petrous apex, retropharyngeal space, and middle and inferior clivus down to the medial aspect of the jugular bulb and condyle regions. Additional maxillary nerve-mandibular nerve vidian corridor visualization provides a lateral transsphenoidal approach to upper clivus lesions.

AB OBJECTIVE: To report baseline demographics and examine for differences in survival for patients with World Health Organization (WHO) grade II and III spinal meningioma.
   METHODS: The National Cancer Database was queried for patients diagnosed with WHO grade II or grade III spinal meningioma between 2004 and 2015. Cases with histopathological confirmation were included. Descriptive statistics were calculated and stratified by tumor type. Facility type, 30-day readmission, and 90-day mortality were also examined. Crude and adjusted Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to evaluate for differences in survival.
   RESULTS: A total of 287 patients with WHO grade II or grade III spinal meningioma (white, n = 237; black, n = 32; Asian and Pacific Islander, n = 11; unknown race, n = 7) were identified. The mean patient age was 56.4 years, and the majority were female (70%; n = 201). Almost one-half of the patients were treated in an academic/research program (45.3%; n = 130,). Those with WHO grade III lesions received the earliest treatment, at a mean of 10.8 days following diagnosis. The proportion of patients with unplanned 30-day readmission following surgery was 4.2% (n = 12). Two patients died within 90 days of surgery. Multivariable analysis demonstrated no differences in survival for patients with WHO grade II or grade III lesions (hazard ratio, 2.01; 95% confidence interval, 0.89-4.52; P = 0.09).
   CONCLUSIONS: No difference in overall survival was identified between patients with WHO grade II or III spinal meningioma, although a trend was seen toward worse survival for patients with WHO grade III lesions.

AB OBJECTIVE: The globus pallidus internus (GPi) and subthalamic nucleus (STN) are therapeutic targets for deep brain stimulation (DBS) in the treatment of isolated dystonia. We conducted a meta-regression analysis on long-term studies of bilateral DBS in the GPi and STN to compare the relative effects of the 2 approaches.
   METHODS: We systematically searched the PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Controlled Register of Trials databases to identify studies reporting the treatment outcomes of GPi DBS and STN DBS for isolated dystonia. The primary outcome measure was the change in the Burke-Fahn-Marsden dystonia rating scale movement score between the baseline and follow-up evaluations. We performed a regression analysis using a random effects model.
   RESULTS: A total of 42 follow-up evaluations (30 for GPi and 12 for STN) nested in 19 studies (16 of GPi and 3 of STN) were included in our analysis. The results from univariate regression analysis suggested that shorter disease duration and STN stimulation were associated with a greater standardized change in the Burke-Fahn-Marsden dystonia rating scale movement score. On combining the factors into 1 model, only the disease duration remained significant. The regression analysis results of the GPi and STN subgroups revealed more persistent improvement after STN stimulation.
   CONCLUSIONS: A shorter disease duration correlated positively with better DBS outcomes. The STN appeared to be an optimized stimulation target for the treatment of isolated dystonia, although randomized controlled trials are needed to compare the treatment efficacy of GPi DBS and STN DBS.

TI Association Between Radiofrequency Rhizotomy Parameters and Duration of

   DIAGNOSIS
AB BACKGROUND: Radiofrequency rhizotomy (RFR) is a commonly used, effective procedure for trigeminal neuralgia (TN), but a subset of patients experiences pain recurrence and requires subsequent surgeries. Currently, the rhizotomy temperature and duration of application are empirically determined, and there is no consensus on what settings are most beneficial. In this study, we analyzed patients who underwent trigeminal RFR and had subsequent surgeries to identify whether rhizotomy parameters were associated with the duration of pain relief.
   METHODS: Single-center, retrospective analysis of patients undergoing RFR for TN from 1995 to 2016. The primary endpoint was subsequent procedure. Associations with rhizotomy parameters and covariates were assessed using Cox regression analysis.
   RESULTS: The study included 338 patients, average age 65 years; 61% were women. Temperature was significantly associated with both the degree of immediate postoperative pain relief and the duration of pain relief, and in subgroup analyses by multiple sclerosis status and RFR procedural count. Ablation duration was also independently significant, though not when analyzed alongside age, sex, and race. Duration of pain relief was generally shorter in patients with multiple sclerosis and in repeated RFR.
   CONCLUSIONS: Higher temperatures may be necessary to achieve pain relief in some patients, given the progressive nature of the facial pain, but they are not associated with longer duration of pain relief in patients who have recurrent pain. Modulation of the ablation duration does not seem to affect the short-term or long-term outcomes.

AB OBJECTIVE: Hemorrhage in the basal ganglia is a common type of intracerebral hemorrhage and has high mortality and poor prognosis. In our study, we aimed to evaluate surgical outcomes and functional recovery after evacuation of hematoma using either craniotomy or endoscopy.
   METHODS: We analyzed retrospective data from 58 patients with basal ganglia hemorrhage who were treated with hematoma evacuation using either craniotomy or endoscopy. Magnetic resonance imaging and a navigation system were used for calculating hematoma volume and for navigation during surgery. Clinical information and surgical outcomes were recorded. At 6-month follow-up, the recovery of neurologic function and the results of the Aphasia Battery of Chinese test were assessed.
   RESULTS: The endoscopy group showed lower intraoperative blood loss (75.36 +/- 45.56 vs. 462.67 +/- 120.08 mL, P < 0.001), shorter operation time (1.59 +/- 0.30 vs. 4.17 +/- 0.86 hours, P < 0.001), and a higher hematoma clearance rate (0.93% +/- 0.05% vs. 0.88% +/- 0.13%, P = 0.04) than the craniotomy group, respectively. No significant differences in mortality were identified, but a trend toward lower mortality in the endoscopy group was apparent (7.14% in the endoscopy group vs. 16.67% in the craniotomy group, P = 0.43). Assessment of neurologic recovery indicated significant differences in the modified Rankin Scale grades between the 2 groups (chi(2) = 4.381, P = 0.036). Listening comprehension and speaking ability were also better in the endoscopy group than the craniotomy group (chi(2) = 4.693, P = 0.03).
   CONCLUSIONS: Evacuation by endoscopy had better surgical outcomes, recovery of neurologic function, and aphasia recovery than evacuation by craniotomy. It appears that endoscopy is the surgical treatment of choice for middle-aged and elderly patients with a basal ganglia hemorrhage volume of >35 mL.

AB OBJECTIVE: To report on the incidence of Modic changes (MCs) in patients with cervical radiculopathy due to a herniated disc. Presence of MCs was correlated to clinical outcomes and the presence of radiological degeneration.
   METHODS: Patients that underwent anterior discectomy for a cervical radiculopathy due to a herniating disc were analyzed for the presence of MCs at baseline and at 1-year follow-up after surgery. Neck Disability Index, physical component summary, mental component summary, and visual analog scale for neck pain and for arm pain were evaluated as clinical outcomes. The presence of radiological degeneration was defined by the method of Goffin.
   RESULTS: The prevalence of MCs was found at 18% at baseline and increased to 28% one year after surgery. Both at baseline and at 1-year follow-up, the percentage of patients with and without MCs reporting neck pain was comparable. Likewise, both at baseline and at 1-year follow-up, the percentage of patients with and without MCs reporting disabling arm pain was comparable. At baseline, the patients with MC demonstrated more radiologic degeneration than those without MC (OR 0.42), but this difference disappeared at 1 year after surgery.
   CONCLUSIONS: MCs were not associated with neck pain, nor with arm pain. Furthermore, there was a tendency for a correlation between the presence of MCs and radiological degeneration.

ID HOSPITAL VOLUME; OUTCOMES; EXCELLENCE; ECONOMIES; SURGERY; CENTERS
AB BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVE: Several studies have documented improved outcomes at high-volume hospitals for neurosurgery. However, the relationship between neurosurgical volume and costs remains poorly understood.
   METHODS: Using neurosurgery-specific Diagnosis-Related Groups (DRG) codes, we identified adult neurosurgical admissions in the National Inpatient Sample from 2002 to 2014. We stratified hospitals by annual neurosurgical volume as high-volume (top 20%) or low-volume centers (bottom80%). We performed survey-weighted regression analyses to examine the impact of case volume on inpatient costs.
   RESULTS: A total of 12,129,029 admissions underwent neurosurgery from 2002 to 2014, with 59.6% treated at high-volume hospitals. Patients at high-volume centers were more likely to have private insurance, higher risk of mortality scores, and higher DRG weight procedures than those at low-volume centers (P < 0.001). High-volume hospital admissions were on average 9% or $1791 more expensive than their low-volume counterparts. However, after adjustment for patient, hospital, and case-mix differences, high-volume hospitals were 4.3% less expensive than low-volume centers ($21,825 vs. $22,924; P < 0.01). The southern United States, which had the biggest volume, showed the highest savings (6.5%).
   CONCLUSIONS: High-volume hospitals provide more cost-effective neurosurgical care. Centralization of care at high-volume neurosurgical institutions may be a promising strategy to delivering higher-value care, achieving better outcomes at lower costs.

AB OBJECTIVE: To explore the effect of preoperative planning using mixed reality (MR) on training of percutaneous transforaminal endoscopic discectomy (PTED).
   METHODS: Before the training, we invited an experienced chief physician to plan the puncture path of PTED on the X-ray films of the lumbar spine model and the 3D Slicer platform, respectively, and used this as the standard to guide trainees. In the aggregate, 60 young residents were randomly divided into Group A (N = 30) and Group B (N = 30). Group A learned the 2-dimensional standard planning route, whereas Group B learned the standard route planning based on MR through the 3D Slicer platform. Then, trainees were asked to conduct PTED puncture on a lumbar spine model. Questionnaires were distributed to trainees before and after the training. During the training, puncture times, operating time (minutes), and fluoroscopy times were recorded.
   RESULTS: After the training, it was obvious that more trainees showed their recognition of MR, believing that MR could help preoperative planning and training of PTED. Their high satisfaction with the training indicated the success of our training. Moreover, puncture times, operating time (minutes), and fluoroscopy times of Group B were significantly lower than those of Group A.
   CONCLUSIONS: MR technology contributes to preoperative planning of PTED and is beneficial in the training of PTED. It significantly reduces puncture times and fluoroscopy times, providing a standardized method for the training of PTED.

   EXERCISE; OBESITY; VARIANT
AB OBJECTIVE: The most potent vasoconstrictor, endothelin-1 and its receptors, endothelin receptor A (EDNRA) and endothelin receptor B (EDNRB) are involved in hypertension. Hypertension is a major risk factor of intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). Recent studies have demonstrated increased plasma endothelin-1 level in ICH patients and relationships between EDNRA and EDNRB genetic variants and ischemic stroke. The aim of the current study was to investigate whether EDNRA and EDNRB polymorphisms are associated with ICH by interacting with blood pressure levels.
   METHODS: Five EDNRA and EDNRB polymorphisms were genotyped in this case-control study.
   RESULTS: We identified that EDNRA rs5333 T allele might be a protective factor of ICH (adjusted odds ratio [OR] [0.638, 95% CI: 0.417-0.977, P = 0.038), while EDNRB rs5351 A allele could be a risk factor of ICH (adjusted OR = 1.476, 95% CI: 1.042-2.089, P = 0.028). Moreover, we only found that the GG genotype of EDNRA rs5335 had higher diastolic blood pressure than the GC D CC genotypes in ICH patients (91.69 +/- 18.77 vs. 84.71 +/- 21.48, P = 0.004).
   CONCLUSIONS: These findings support the important role of EDNRA and EDNRB polymorphisms in ICH, and suggest that they do not interact with blood pressure levels on altering ICH risk.

AB BACKGROUND: Thyroid cancer, one of the most common endocrine malignancies in developed areas and China, is associated with favorable prognosis. However, the presence of spinal metastases will remarkably reduce the life expectancy for patients with thyroid cancer. In addition, limited information is available about such disease.
   METHODS: Various potential clinical factors were submitted to univariate and multivariate analyses to identify the independent variables that predicted the prognosis for patients. In addition, the survival rate was estimated according to the KaplaneMeier method, and statistic differences were calculated by the log-rank test. Moreover, factors with a P value of <= 0.1 were performed multivariate analysis using a multivariate Cox proportional hazards model, and factors with a P value of <0.05 were considered as statistically significant.
   RESULTS: Seven potential independent prognostic factors had been identified through univariate analysis, which were then subjected to multivariate analysis. Our results suggested that age of <= 50 years, single segment involved, and follicular thyroid cancer were the independent favorable prognostic factors.
   CONCLUSIONS: Findings in this study indicate that age of <= 50 years, single segment involved, and follicular thyroid cancer are favorable prognostic factors for patients with thyroid cancer spinal metastases.

AB OBJECTIVE: We aimed to characterize the expression of transforming growth factor-a (TGF-alpha) and Ki-67 and to assess the relationship between TGF-alpha and Ki-67 expression and prognostic factors in skull base chordoma.
   METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the data from 46 patients with skull base chordoma. The follow-up duration ranged from 1 to 168 months (mean, 74.1). The survival data were statistically analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method and multivariate Cox regression analysis. The expression of TGF-alpha and Ki-67 were detected by immunohistochemical staining of paraffin-embedded patient tissue specimens.
   RESULTS: The total resection (TR) group had longer overall survival compared with the non-TR group (P = 0.042). The TR group also had longer progression-free survival (PFS) than did the non-TR group (P = 0.046). The group with a high Ki-67 labeling index (Ki-67LI) had shorter overall survival than did the group with a low Ki-67LI (P = 0.039). Also, the group with a high Ki-67LI had significantly shorter PFS than did the group with a low Ki-67LI (P = 0.016). Moreover, the group with high TGF-alpha expression had significantly shorter PFS compared with the group with low TGF-alpha expression (P = 0.005).
   CONCLUSIONS: Our results have shown that high levels of TGF-alpha and Ki-67 are associated with shorter PFS in patients with chordoma. We have confirmed the role of Ki-67 as a functional molecular marker of poor prognosis. We also identified TGF-alpha as a potential novel biomarker for predicting prognosis for patients with skull base chordoma.

AB BACKGROUND: Hyperactive dysfunction syndrome (HDS) of the cranial nerves, such as trigeminal neuralgia (TN), hemifacial spasm (HFS), and glossopharyngeal neuralgia (GPN), is commonly managed by microsurgical treatment. However, certain patients may present a combination of these syndromes in the neurosurgery department. Here, we aimed to retrospectively assess patients with combined HDS from a single center.
   METHOD: Of 1275 consecutive patients with HDS treated at our center between 2007 and 2017, 37 patients with combined HDS were enrolled, and their medical and surgical records were analyzed.
   RESULTS: The patients with combined HDS, accounting for 2.9% of all patients with HDS, included 22 patients with bilateral TN, 5 patients with TN-HFS, 8 patients with TN-GPN, and 2 patients with GPN-HFS. A comparison of patients with single and combined HDS indicated a significant difference in the mean age at initial diagnosis (63.57 vs. 56.18 years, P = 0.000) but no such difference in the sex ratio (0.54 vs. 0.59, P = 0.865) or incidence of hypertension (32.43% vs. 24.56%, P = 0.274). In total, 32 microvascular decompression (MVD) procedures were performed in the 27 patients with combined HDS, and repeated MVD was required in 5 patients with bilateral TN. Of the 27 patients who underwent MVD, 25 (92.6%) experienced clinical cure or obvious alleviation.
   CONCLUSIONS: Combined HDS involves a group of functional disturbance disorders affecting specific cranial nerves, and it may include TN, HFS, and GPN. In addition to gender and incidence of hypertension, age appeared to be a vital indicator for the development of combined HDS, although this finding was inconsistent in previous studies. MVD appears to be a safe and effective treatment for combined HDS, with a high rate of long-term success.

TI Analysis of Peripheral Blood Cells' Transcriptome in Patients With

DT Article
DE Gene expression omnibus; Peripheral blood cells' transcriptome;

ID INTRACRANIAL ANEURYSMS; INFLAMMATION
AB BACKGROUND: Subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) is an uncommon disease. Considering ruptured intracranial aneurysms as the main cause of this disease and only a minority of the intracranial aneurysms will rupture sooner or later, to understand the underlying pathology or a specific gene expression profile of an impending ruptured intracranial aneurysm is of great importance.
   METHODS: The transcriptome in peripheral blood cells of patients with SAH from ruptured aneurysm was compared with that of control patients suffering from headaches. The microarray dataset GSE36791 comprised 43 patients with SAH from ruptured aneurysms and 18 control patients. Differential expression analysis was performed with the R language packages to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Gene Ontology enrichment analysis and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway database analysis were performed to identify significantly altered biological functions and pathways, respectively. The protein-protein interaction networks were constructed with information from the STRING database.
   RESULTS: A total of 528 DEGs were identified, of which 311 were upregulated and 217 downregulated. Clustering analysis confirmed that these genes can distinguish ruptured aneurysm SAH patients from the control patients. The DEGs were mainly enriched for immune/inflammation response and related pathways. Among the DEGs, 8 genes (ARG1, MAPK14, RPS2, SPI1, FYN, CEBPB, FLOT1, and CD4) were identified as the key regulators in the Protein-Protein Interaction network. MAPK14, CEBPB, FLOT1, and CD4 might be potential biomarkers of SAH.
   CONCLUSION: This study identified a range of DEGs SAH patients with ruptured aneurysms, which may enhance our current knowledge on this disease and may provide potential biomarkers of this disease.

AB OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of tranexamic acid (TXA) in patients with adolescent idiopathic scoliosis undergoing corrective surgery.
   METHODS: A literature search of PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library was performed to identify studies published from inception to February 2019. After study selection and data extraction, statistical analysis was performed. Odds ratios and weighted mean differences (WMDs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for all available clinical outcomes were analyzed using fixed-effects or random-effects models.
   RESULTS: Twelve studies comprising 2500 patients were included. Intravenous TXA use was associated with significantly fewer patients received blood transfusions (odds ratio, 0.12; 95% CI, 0.06 to 0.22; P < 0.001), less intraoperative estimated blood loss (WMD, -470.07; 95% CI, -645.23 to -294.90; P < 0.001), less intraoperative estimated blood loss per segment (WMD, -27.40; 95% CI, -32.80 to -22.00; P < 0.001), less cell salvage blood transfusion (WMD, -106.02; 95% CI, -170.84 to -41.20; P = 0.001), and shorter surgical time (WMD, -26.18; 95% CI, -46.91 to -5.46; P = 0.010). No significant difference was found in postoperative hemoglobin (WMD, 0.39; 95% CI, -0.07 to 0.86; P = 0.100) and hemoglobin change (WMD, -0.92; 95% CI, -2.90 to 1.07; P = 0.360) between TXA and control groups. No renal, thromboembolic, or other major complications associated with TXA were noted in included studies.
   CONCLUSIONS: TXA was effective in reducing surgical time, intraoperative estimated blood loss, and blood transfusion without increasing complications in patients undergoing corrective surgery for adolescent idiopathic scoliosis. TXA had no influence on postoperative hemoglobin and hemoglobin change.

AB Ballistic effects due to recoil nuclei will be the predominant mode of long-term radiation damage of nuclear waste glass in disposal facilities. While these ballistic effects are known to modify the glass structure in ways that have been quantified using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, the effect of irradiation-induced structural changes on glass corrosion is not understood. Monte Carlo (MC) simulations were therefore performed to quantify the effects of structural changes determined from MD simulations on the corrosion of simplified nuclear waste glasses, namely sodium borosilicate and sodium alumino-borosilicate glasses. MC simulations were first performed to determine separately the effects of irradiation-induced changes in boron coordination, the number and nature of Q. species, and the angular distribution of Si-O-Si linkages, that is, changes to the short-range order of the glass. Generally, the MC simulations showed the resulting effects on the kinetics (B release rate) and extent (B leached thickness) of corrosion were correlated to the extent of depolymerization of the glass network introduced by these local structural changes. The combined effects of these structural changes, as parameterized using the results of MD simulations, were then determined using a glass composition for which relevant experimental data were available for comparison. Here, the combined effect of local changes was lower than the increase in alteration depth observed upon irradiation. This insight from the MC simulations highlighted the need to consider changes in the medium-range order to completely account for experimental observations.

AB Photo-induced phenomena are investigated in new metastable Ag-x(As20S80)(100-x) chalcogenide thin-films prepared by the co-evaporation technique. Under irradiation using an Ar laser at 488 run, periodic ripples structures formation are observed inside of the irradiated spot. With an increasing irradiation time or power density, a characteristic evolution of ripples is observed from a random structure to a series of generally aligned peaks-andvalleys periodic structures until a complete break-up of the film (laser dewetting). The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) of irradiated areas shows periodic ripples are aligned perpendicularly to the electric field vector of the incident light. Moreover, photo-induced birefringence (PIB) is observed during ripples formation. The kinetics of structural changes during the irradiation of the films is analysed using Raman spectroscopy. The molecular rearrangement from sulphur-cis toward sulphur-trans through irradiation is proposed to explain the experimentally observed PIB.

AB The high polarizability, low photon energy, high non-linear character and dual functions in glass network make diamagnetic Nb2O5 attractive to magneto optical glass based photonics and sensing devices. In this paper, we report for the first time the influence of Nb2O5 on glass formation, structure, photoluminescence, magnetic and Faraday rotation properties of heavy metal oxide diamagnetic glass. Results suggested that Nb2O5 doping amount greatly influenced its coordination numbers and roles in glass network. Ni2O5 amount <= 5 mol% in glass presented in NiO4 which played glass former role and strengthened the PbO4, BiO6, BiO3 and BO3 units composed glass network connectivity, transparent and homogeneous glasses were obtained. DSC measurement showed that the 1%, 2% and 5%Nb2O5 doping increased the T-g and thermal stability of glass. Nb2O5 doping amount higher than 5% presented as NiO6 units which played glass modifier role in glass which distorted glass structure and produced BiNbO4 and Nb2O5 crystalline. A red-shift of absorption edge from 500 nm to 529 nm was observed for Nb2O5 doped glasses. Due to the high optical basicity of host, niobium existed in glass only as Ni5+, and the electron transfers between O2- and Nb5+ displayed two broad emission bands centered at 376 cm and 493 nm (excited at 267 nm) in photoluminescence spectra. 5Nb(2)O(5)-5B(2)O(3)-45PbO-45Bi(2)O(3) glass exhibited significant thermal stability (100 degrees C), good photoluminescence, high magnetic susceptibility (57.32 x 10(-6) emu/g), and Verdet constant (0.1713 min/G.cm at 633 nm). The novelty of this work is to combine the high polarizability, dual roles properties of Nb2O5 and the high optical basicity of diamagnetic host glass to achieve a diamagnetic valence of Nb and enhance Faraday rotation performance.

AB Polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) nanocomposite films embedded with iron (Fe) nanoparticles were prepared via the solution cast technique. The effect of Fe nanoparticles on the structural and optical properties of PVA nanocomposite films were investigated using X-ray diffraction, a scanning electron microscope, and UV-Vis spectroscopy. The size of the Fe nanoparticles was calculated using the Debye-Scherrer equation, and it was found that there was an increase in nanoparticle size after dispersion in the polymer matrix due to aggregation. Optical parameters such as optical band gap, Urbach energy, refractive index and extinction coefficient were investigated. The transmittance of a pure PVA film decreases from 82% to 18% after 3 wt% Fe nanoparticle dispersion in a polymer matrix. The direct optical band gap was found to decrease whereas Urbach energy was found to increase with the increase in Fe nanoparticle concentration. In addition, the refractive index and extinction coefficient of polymer nanocomposite films were found to increase compared to those made of pure PVA. Also, the optical dielectric and optical conductivity were observed to increase with an increase in Fe nanoparticle concentration.

AB To understand the impact of dissolved water on structure and properties, four boron-rich glasses of molar compositions 15-x Na2O x CaO 15 SiO2 70 B2O3 (with x = 0, 7.5, 10) and 10 Na2O 15 SiO2 75 B2O3 were prepared and subsequently hydrated (up to 8 wt% H2O). Density measurements show a non-linear trend upon hydration implying large structural changes in particular at water contents < 2 wt%. Near-infrared spectroscopy shows hydroxyl groups are the dominant species in all glasses upon the entire range of water content. Molecular H2O is detectable only at total water contents > 2 wt%. B-11 MAS NMR spectra show that the abundance of BO4 species is mainly controlled by ratio of (Na2O + CaO)/B2O3 while incorporation of water plays a minor role. Compared to borate glasses, the efficiency of formation of BO4 tetrahedra is favored by crosslinking of the network by SiO4-units. The glass transition temperatures, determined by differential thermal analysis, decreases continuously with water content due to breakage of B-O-B bonds by hydrolysis. However, compared to silicates and aluminosilicates, the effect of dissolved water is less pronounced which can be explained by weaker B-O-B bonds in comparison to Si-O-Si bonds.

AB In this work, amorphous Ge1-xCx films were deposited on As40Se60 chalcogenide glass by radio frequency magnetron co-sputtering (rf MS) under low temperature. The deposition temperature rise, the structural, mechanical and optical properties of Ge1-xCx films as a function of sputtering power was investigated by thermocouple, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), Raman Spectroscopy, X-ray Diffraction (XRD), Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM), Fourier Transformed Infrared Spectroscopy, Surface Profiler, Continuous Stiffness Measurement (CSM) and Environmental Testing Equipment. All the deposition temperature rise of Ge1-xCx films generated from radical ions and neutrals decomposed with different sputtering power are mild (< 75 degrees C) and much lower than the transition temperature of As40Se60 chalcogenide glass (185 +/- 5 degrees C). The results reveal that C-Ge sp(3) hybridization structure decrease, olefinic chains and nc-graphite clusters are transformed to fused aromatic rings, the disorder state and C-C sp(3) hybridization structure of amorphous carbon phase increase as sputtering power increases from 50 W to 450 W. Ge atoms are strong nucleation sites for the transformation of olefinic chains and nc-graphite to fused aromatic rings, whereas, highly hydrogenated olefinic chains can inhibit this nucleation function. The nanohardness of Ge1-xCx films increases from 4.1 GPa to 12.1 GPa, residual stress of Ge(1-x)Cx films transforms from tensile stress to compressive stress, refractive index of Ge1-xCx films increases from 2.1 (150 W) to 3.1 (450 W) as sputtering power increases from 50 W to 450 W. Ge1-xCx film (150 W) with tensile stress was used as transition layer, consisting of Ge1-xCx/ Diamond-like Carbon (DLC) double protective antireflective film, which shows excellent adhesion and environmental durability on the surface of As40Se60 chalcogenide glass. The average infrared transmittance and nanohardness of As40Se60 chalcogenide glass are promoted from 62.2% to 72.6% (3 mu m ( )similar to 5 mu m) and 1.9 GPa to 7.8 GPa, respectively.

AB We show that strong coupling with the nuclear spin ensemble leaves an imprint on the nutation dynamics of the electron spin in the form of forced oscillations. The frequency of these oscillations equals Larmor precession frequency of the nuclear spins. This effect is evidenced by our experimental data on Rabi oscillations of paramagnetic nitroxyl radical TEMPO ((2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidin-1-yl)oxidanyl) dispersed in glassy and crystalline ethanol. The data are interpreted in terms of a simple model that represents an impact of the proton spin bath as random local field with certain probability distribution. The electron spin coherence times of TEMPO in ethanol obtained by means of Hahn spin echo and Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill sequences are compared with the calculations based on a spin diffusion model.

AB Ion exchanges (IE) on silicate, tellurite, borate and phosphate glass have been extensively studied for different objectives such as changing glass refractive index, strengthening glass structure or realizing nanometal-glass systems, however, ion exchange on lead-bismuth-borate diamagnetic glass for Faraday rotation improvement is interesting and attractive for magneto optical glass and magneto optical waveguide devices. In this study, for the first time, we studied the one-step Ag+-Na+ ion exchange on diamagnetic Bi2O3-PbO-B2O3-Na2O (PBBN) glass for the aim of improving diamagnetic properties and providing an efficient route for magneto-optical waveguide. The Ag+-Na+ ions has been sucessfully exchanged at 270 degrees C for 20 min condition. And without any further heat or H-2 treatment after IE, the Ag+ ions and Ag-0 nanoparticles co-existed in glass. Heat treatment in H-2 after IE not only greatly increased the Ag-0 NPs size, but also produced the Bi-0 crystals which were not helpful for glass properties. Ag nanoparticles showed characteristic surface plasmon resonance peak at 500-550 nm range. Raman spectra displayed the evolutions of Ag+ and Ag-0 in functions of different ion exchange conditions. The UV-Visible and Faraday rotation measurements suggested that high polarizability and diamagnetic susceptibility properties of diamagnetic Ag+ ions and Ag-0 nanoparticle induced surface plasmonic effects improved the optical refractive index and magneto optical Verdet constant. A simple linear optical waveguide also were obtained on PBBN glass surface using the optimized IE parameters. The proposed one-step ion exchange technique on diamagnetic glass will be an efficient method for glass properties enhancement and magneto optical waveguide fabrication.

AB In order to understand how surface charge accumulation and other reactivity-related phenomena are controlled by the surface structure, it is necessary to have a detailed appreciation of the bulk glass structures. Here, we report a detailed MD study of the bulk structures of silica-rich calcium aluminosilicate (CAS) glasses along the tecto-silicate join.
   It is confirmed that the structures of these glasses contain small concentrations of over- and under-coordinated defect species, such as NBO, TBO and [5]-coordinated aluminum, Al-C5, in contrast to the simple idea that these fully charge-compensated compositions, with Ca/Al2O3 ratios of unity, should have fully polymerized structures. The Si,Al distribution was found to be largely random (i.e. Lowenstein's rule is not obeyed) and no significant segregation of Ca to Al was observed.
   Interactions between TBO and Al-C5 were manifest both in the presence of an additional small peak in the Al-O-Al BAD and in the formation of structural complexes involving small-membered rings, particularly 2-rings. These defect structural complexes contributed to the structural inhomogeneity of these glasses.

AB The influence of diel temperature variations (DTVs) on nitrogen removal and bacterial communities was investigated in two parallel anammox reactors (i.e., control and DTV reactors). The control reactor was ope rated at a constant temperature of 30 degrees C, whereas the DTV reactor was operated in a temperature fluctuation mode with a cycle of 12/12 h of high/low temperatures. Nine water temperature variations for t he day/night periods were set from 30/30 degrees C (i.e., Delta 0 degrees C) to 38/22 degrees C (i.e., Delta 16 degrees C). An increase in DTVs from Delta 8 degrees C (34/26 degrees C) to Delta 16 degrees C (38/22 degrees C) caused a significant decline in reactor performance and a shift in bacterial diversity. Compared to the control reactor, for instance, nitrogen removal efficiency decreased (P < 0.05) when temperature fluctuations exceeded Delta 8 degrees C in the DTV reactor with a decreasing Delta NO3-/Delta NH4+ ratio (from 0.21 +/- 0.15 to 0.16 +/- 0.04). The results of 16S rRNA gene sequencing showed that the initial disturbance of temperature variations led to increased levels of bacterial diversity (i.e., alpha diversity) and decreased community levels of anammox consortia whereas they slightly recovered at the and of each DTV phase. Notably, Candidatus Jettenia was more sensitive to strong water temperature fluctuations, with the lower relative abundance at Delta 14 degrees C (17.11 +/- 5.01%) and Delta 16 degrees C (17.83 +/- 7.22%) than at Delta 4 degrees C (39.82 +/- 0.01%). In contrast, Ca. Brocadia and Ca. Kuenenia had higher relative abundance at Delta 14 degrees C (i.e., 0.24 +/- 0.07% and 0.09 +/- 0.02%, respectively) and Delta 16 degrees C (i.e., 0.28 +/- 0.05% and 0.12 +/- 0.03%, respectively) compared to that at Delta 4 degrees C (i.e., 0.15 +/- 0.04% and 0.04 +/- 0.01%, respectively). Nitrifiers (i. e., unidentified_Nitrospiraceae and Nitrosomonas) and denitrifiers (i.e., Denitratisoma) were also capable of tolerating high temperature perturbations. Overall this study furthers our knowledge of responses of the microbial ecology of anammox bacteria to DTVs in anammox processes, which could aid us in optimizing anammox-related wastewater treatment systems and in understanding the nitrogen cycles of natural ecosystems.

AB Improving biodegradation of pharmaceuticals during wastewater treatment is critical to control the release of emerging micropollutants to natural waters. In this study, biodegradation of six model pharmaceuticals was investigated at different initial concentrations in two discrete activated sludge systems, and moreover, the correlation was explored between the biodegradation rate and key molecular properties of the contaminants. First, the biodegradation rates of the pharmaceuticals were measured fitting a pseudo first-order kinetic model to the experimental kinetic data. The degradation rate constants (k(bio)) were found to negatively correlate to the initial concentration of the chemicals, indicating an inhibitory effect on the microorganisms by the pharmaceuticals. Further examinations of the rate data against the key molecular properties of the pharmaceuticals revealed, for the first time, that the electrophilicity index (omega), a measure of electrophilic power, served as a better indicator of the biodegradability and predictive parameter for the k(bio) than the conventional log K-ow (a measure of hydrophobicity) in the two discrete aerobic activated sludge systems. However, the correlation strength (goodness-of-fit) between omega and k(bio )deteriorated when the reactor turned from aerobic to anoxic and anaerobic conditions, suggesting that electron transfer from pharmaceutical molecules to enzymes was inhibited when dissolved oxygen was deficit or absent. Our results show that omega can potentially serve as a straightforward and robust indicator for predicting the biodegradability of pharmaceutical in conventional activated sludge processes.

AB Dissolved organic matter (DOM) from alpine glaciers is highly biolabile and plays a vital role in the biogeochemical cycle of meltwater-impacted environments. To unravel the composition and interactions of DOM with the bacterial community in glacier and glacier meltwater, we conducted sampling of two different Tibetan Plateau glaciers and carried out laboratory bio-incubation experiments. The field data revealed that four protein-like components accounted for 86.0 +/- 11.9% of the total variability of all six fluorescence components, which suggests a predominantly microbial source of glacial chromophoric DOM (CDOM). The ice and meltwater samples displayed major contributions of molecular formulae associated with lipids and proteins (i.e. high H/C) as revealed by ultrahigh resolution mass spectrometry. Multiple linear regression models revealed that the abundant phyla explain 64.2%, 61.3%, and 65.0% of the variability of microbial and terrestrial humic-like, and protein-like components, respectively. Correlation-based network analysis determined the metabolic niches of the bacterial community members associated with different fluorescence types in biogeochemical processes. Furthermore, laboratory DOM bio-incubation experiments confirmed that sub-components of the CDOM pool differentially participate in bacterial metabolism. We therefore conclude that the bacterial community interacted closely with the compositional variability of DOM in the investigated alpine glacial environments by both producing and consuming of DOM.

AB The hydrophobic polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are apt to adhere tightly to the sediments in aquifer and thus pose great threats to the aquatic environment of groundwater and surface water as well as human health. The present study constructed functionalized microbubbles, named colloidal ozone aphrons (COAs), by dissolving ozone-contained air into the nonionic surfactant (Tween-20) solution at the pressure of 300 kPa for the in situ remediation of phenanthrene (PHE)-contaminated sediments. The COA system aimed at improving the PHE elimination in terms of (i) enhancing the migration and transpor tation ability of the bubble system in the contaminated aquifer matrix, (ii) accurately desorbing the target hydrophobic contaminants from sediments, and (iii) reinforcing the in situ oxidation degradation immediately after or simultaneously when the PAHs are desorbed into the aqueous phase. Experimental results demonstrated that the COAs exhibited similar characteristics as the classical colloidal gas aphrons (CGAs), including the high stability (half-life time > 200 s), typical morphology and average bubble size ( 114-162 mu m); higher air hold-up of COAs was achieved (i. e. > 20%) compared with the air-microbubbles (1-2%) obtained under the same generation conditions. Although the encapsulated ozone could oxidize the surfactant-layers, the properties and behaviors of COAs were not greatly affected. The surfactant multi-layers endowed the COAs with strong hydrophobic attraction with PHE, great migration capacity and enlarged oxidation area in the sediment matrix. Approximately 96.9% of PHE was removed from the sediments and 84.9% of the overall PHE was oxidized at the high ozone concentration of 0.6 mg/L when the initial PHE concentration was 240.0 mu g/kg. The COA-involved remediation technology provided the insight of combining the processes of washing and oxidizing through adopting the particularly conceived microbubbles. The in situ and selective removal of hydrophobic organic contaminants from sediments in aquifer was well achieved in this study. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The reuse of water in a range of potable and non-potable applications is an important factor in the augmentation of water supply and in improving water security and productivity worldwide. A key hindrance to the reuse of water is the cost of compliance testing and process validation associated with ensuring that pathogen and chemicals in the feedwater are removed to a level that ensures no acute or chronic health and/or environmental effects. The critical control point (CCP) approach is well established and widely adopted by water utilities to provide an operational and risk management framework for the removal of pathogens in the treatment system. The application of a CCP approach to barriers in a treatment system for the removal of chemicals is presented. The application exemplar is to a small community wastewater treatment system that aims to produce potable quality water from a secondary treated wastewater effluent, however, the concepts presented are generic. The example used seven treatment barriers, five of which were designed and operated as CCP barriers for pathogens. The work demonstrates a method and risk management framework by which three of the seven barriers could also include a CCP approach for the removal of chemicals. Analogous to a CCP approach for pathogens, the potential is to reduce the use of chemical analysis as a routine determinant of performance criteria. The operational deployment of a CCP approach for chemicals was augmented with the development of a decision tree encompassing the classification of chemicals and the total removal credits across the treatment train in terms of the mechanistic removal of chemicals for each barrier. Validation of the approach is shown for an activated sludge, ozone and reverse osmosis barrier. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Siderite (FeCO3) is one kind of abundant and cheap carbonate minerals, but it has never been used as inorganic carbon sources and pH buffer in the sulfur autotrophic denitrification before. In this study, sulfur-siderite autotrophic denitrification (SSAD) system was formed. Batch, column and pilot experiments of the SSAD system showed that siderite could provide inorganic sources and pH buffer for sulfur autotrophic denitrification. The optimal volume ratio of sulfur and siderite was 1:3 for the SSAD system. Siderite could not be used as an electron donor by the sulfur autotrophic denitrifiers. The SSAD column removed 28 mg/L NO3- -N and 3.1 mg/L PO43--P completely at 12 h HRT. The SSAD pilot biofilter during treating secondary effluent obtained stable NO and PO43- - removal, and controlled effluent NO3--N and PO43--P around 4 and 0.2 mg/L, respectively, at 4 h HRT, and no blocking occurred in operation of 401 days. In the SSAD system, the main bacteria were Thiobacillus (67.8%), Sulfurimonas (20.0%), and Simplicispira (3.5%); and Sulfurimonas (29.4%), Ferritrophicum (15.2%), and Thiobacillus (10.3%) during treating synthetic wastewater and secondary effluent, respectively. PO43- was removed through iron phosphate precipitate. The SSAD system was a promising way to remove NO3- and PO43-- simultaneously from wastewater lack of organic carbon sources.

AB A three-dimensional Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) model was developed to study shear stress induced by spherical cap bubbles in hollow fibre (HF) membrane modules configured with a packing density of 38 m(2)/m(3), to predict the shear profile in a commercial hollow fibre membrane module of 265 m(2)/m(3). The CFD models computational effort was minimised by simulating the formation of bubble structures and their rising velocities in modules with packing densities of 1.8 and 38 m(2)/m(3) and validated with experimental calibration of shear profiles via electro-diffusion methods (EDM). Pulse bubbles (300 mL) generated from a single sparger at 0.5 Hz produced more satellite bubbles in the wake zone of the leading bubble in high packing density (38 m(2)/m(3)) than in low packing density modules (1.8 m(2)/m(3)). The bubble rise velocity was approximately 8% lower in the 38 m(2)/m(3) than in the 1.8 m(2)/m(3) module. Increasing packing density reduced the shear profile from a single sparger and the dispersion of the satellite bubbles in the horizontal plane, especially in the upper part of the membrane module. For systems with multiple spargers, the interaction between pulses generated more shear than the pulses from a single sparger, and produced a more uniform shear profile in the module through asynchronous bubble release from adjacent spargers than synchronous release. A 33% increase in the "Zone of Influence", the flow region where the upward velocity >0.2 m/s, was achieved by moving from a synchronous to an asynchronous form of aeration. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Depleted oxygen (O-2) in the sediment and overlying water of malodorous black water poses a potential threat to aquatic ecosystems. This study presents a method for sustainable regulation of the dissolved oxygen (DO) levels towards the malodorous black water. Oxygen-loaded natural porous materials were prepared by vacuum degassing to remove air from the pores and fill them with pure O-2. Capping anaerobic sediment with the prepared 6 oxygen-loaded porous materials was effective in prompting the DO concentration of the malodorous black water. Although granules activated carbon (GAC) displayed the highest oxygen-loading capability, oxygen-loaded volcanic stone additive was more efficient for long-lasting combating of the anaerobic condition because the DO level at sediment-water interface (SWI) and the DO penetration depth showed approximately 5.38- and 3.75-fold increase, respectively, compared with the untreated systems. The improvement in DO was substantially enhanced in the presence of submerged macrophyte (Vallisneria natans), during which the release of O-2 from oxygen-loaded volcanic stone facilitated the plant growth. With the joint efforts of the O-2 released from volcanic stone and photosynthesis by the macrophytes, the DO levels were maintained at approximately 6.80 mg/L after a 41-day incubation, which exceeded (P < 0.05) the value in only oxygen-loaded volcanic stone or macrophytes added treatments. In addition to the elevated DO level, the combined employment of oxygen-loaded volcanic stone and macrophytes triggered a negative ammonia (NH4+-N) flux across the SWI and an 85.82% reduction of methane (CH4) production compared with those without treatment, accompanied by a decrease in total inorganic carbon and a 2.55- fold increasing of submerged macrophyte biomass, which is presumably attributed to nitrification, remineralization, and assimilation. The results obtained here shed a degree of light on the sustainable modulation of the anaerobic condition in malodorous black water. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This study attempted to investigate the influence of operation mode and wastewater strength on startup period, aerobic granular sludge (AGS) characteristics, and system effluent quality at pilot scale. Granulation was monitored in three pilot-scale granular sequencing batch reactors (GSBRs). Comparative evaluation of AN/O/AX/O_SBR and O_SBR, fed with wastewater of the same composition but run with completely different SBR reaction phase arrangements (alternating vs. purely aerobic), revealed the effect of SBR operation mode. Comparative study of the GSBRs operated with alternating SBR reaction phases (AN/O/AX/O_SBR and AN/O_SBR) and fed with wastewater of different strength (high- vs. medium-strength) determined the effect of wastewater composition. Granulation time and granule size were regulated by wastewater strength and the resulting organic and sludge loading conditions. Whereas, AGS morphology, granule structure, and floccular proportion of AGS were attributed to SBR operation mode. Effluent clarity in terms of suspended solid concentration depended on wastewater strength. Subtle but distinct microbial selection strategies were in effect during granulation which were also imposed by wastewater strength. Due to strong correlation between the effluent and AGS microbial structures, demonstrated by biodiversity analysis, differences in the microbial composition of effluent biomass and washout patterns of the GSBRs could be explained by wastewater strength as well. Limited nutrient removal efficiencies, restricted by organic matter concentration, could be due to involvement of unorthodox nutrient removal pathways which warrants further investigation.

AB The Tibetan Plateau is a critical ecosystem that sensitively responds to ongoing glacier shrinkage and permafrost thaw. Dissolved organic matter (DOM) in Tibetan Alpine rivers plays pivotal roles in the biogeochemical cycling of elements and nutrients at regional and even global scales, impacting water quality, downstream environments, and climate. However, little is known about the characteristics and dynamics of DOM in these watersheds. We investigated five major Himalayan rivers in the southern Tibetan Plateau, utilizing bulk dissolved organic carbon (DOC), optical properties, and molecular formulas. We found extremely low DOC and fluorescent DOM (FDOM) levels in the rivers (average DOC: 0.25-0.87 mg L-1, FDOM: 0.02-0.05 RU) with a highly degraded molecular signature, which was enriched with heteroatomic molecular formulas (S-containing: 58-72%, N-containing: 61-86%) and condensed aromatics (31-39% vs. similar to 11% in world major rivers). Further, 81-99% of the condensed aromatics was identified as dissolved black nitrogen (DBN) with multiple nitrogen atoms, typical for grassy biomass combustion. The findings highlighted potentially fast DOM remineralization leading to the release of CO2 and enriched apparently anthropogenic condensed aromatics and heteroatomic formulas in what have been considered pristine Tibetan rivers. These findings should be considered in future biogeochemical models and ecosystem management. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Ubiquitous presence of chloride in water effluents may result in the unavoidable electrogeneration of active chlorine species when considering the application of electrochemical advanced oxidation processes as water treatment technologies. However, less attention has been drawn to the subsequent generation of other combined chlorine species such as chloramines. In this work, the electrogeneration of chloramines has been assessed in different water matrices containing NHCl4, urea or synthetic urine. The yield of chloramines has been followed in-situ by differential electrochemistry mass spectroscopy (DEMS) during electrochemical advanced oxidation process with boron-doped diamond (BDD) anodes. Furthermore, the influence of several variables such as chloride concentration, pH or organics concentration on the different distribution of inorganic monochloramine, dichloramine and trichloramine released as products has been considered.

AB Microbes drive ecosystems and their viruses manipulate these processes, yet the importance of tidal functioning on the estuarine viruses and microbes remains poorly elucidated. Here, an integrative investigation on tidal patterns in viral and microbial communities and their inherent interactions over an crobial abundances oscillated significantly over the tidal cycle with relatively higher abundances observed at spring tide compared to neap tide. The distinct tidal dynamic patterns in bacterial production and community composition were tightly associated with the variations in viral infection, production and decay, revealing the tide-driven interactions between viruses and microbes. Concurrent with the higher viral decay but lower bacterial abundance and inhibited bacterial metabolism during the neap tide, lower gross viral production was coupled with a synchronous switching from viral lytic to lysogenic infection induced by the loss of viral infection efficiency and the transition from marine to freshwater bacterial populations triggered by tidal mixing. Our results highlighted the major tidal impact on the microbial dynamics through virus-host interactions, with cascading effects, neglected so far, on estuarine biogeochemical cycles.

AB The quality and quantity of natural organic matter (NOM) has been observed to evolve which poses challenges to water treatment facilities. Even though NOM may not be toxic itself, its presence in water has aesthetic effects, enhances biological growth in distribution networks, binds with pollutants and controls the bioavailability of trace metals. Even though NOM has heterogeneous functional groups, the predominant ones are the carboxyl and the phenolic groups, which have high affinities for metals depending on the pH. The properties of both the NOM and the trace elements influence the binding kinetics and preferences. Ca2+ prefers to bind with the carboxylic groups especially at a low pH while Zn2+  prefers the amine groups though practically, most cations bind to several functions groups. The nature of the chemical environment (neighboring ligands) the ligand finds itself equally influences its preference for a cation. The presence of NOM, cations or a complex of NOM-cations may have significant impact on the efficiency of water processes such as coagulation, adsorption, ion exchange resin and membrane filtration. In coagulation, the complexation between the coagulant salts and NOM helps to remove NOM from solution. This positive influence can further be enhanced by the addition of Ca2+. A negative influence is however, observed in lime-softening method as NOM complexes with Ca2+. A negative influence is also seen in membrane filtration where divalent cations partially neutralize the carboxyl functional groups of NOM thereby reducing the repulsion effect on NOM and increasing membrane fouling. The formation of disinfection by-products could either be increased or reduced during chlorination, the speciation of products formed is modified with generally the enhancement of haloacetic acid formation observed in presence of metal cations. This current work, presents in details the interactions of cations and NOM in the environment, the preference of cations for each functional group and the possible competition between cations for binding sites, as well as the possible impacts of the presence of cations, NOM, or their complex on water treatment processes.

AB Chromate is considered to be a toxic contaminant because of its potential to harm animal and human health. In this study, polypyrrole/calcium rectorite clay composites (PPy/Ca-REC composites) were prepared as a potential adsorbent, via in situ polymerization of pyrrole monomer for adsorption of Cr(VI) from aqueous solution. The XRD results indicated that the clay sheets were exfoliated in the prepared composites. SEM results showed good dispersion of the PPy on the clay sheets. The adsorption of Cr(VI) onto the PPy/Ca-REC adsorbent was highly pH-dependent, and the removal efficiency by PPy/Ca-REC composites was much higher than the PPy homopolymer. Adsorption kinetics followed a pseudo-second-order kinetic model with an equilibrium reached within 30-180 min. The adsorption isotherm data were fitted well by the Langmuir isotherm model with the maximum adsorption capacity of 714.29-833.33 mg/g at 25-45 degrees C. The PPy/Ca-REC composites could be regenerated and reused for three consecutive adsorption-desorption cycles without loss of the original removal efficiency for Cr(VI) removal. Furthermore, the selective adsorption of Cr(VI) was demonstrated in binary adsorption systems with coexisting ions. The mechanisms of Cr(VI) removal containing electrostatic interactions, ionic interaction as well as reduction of Cr(VI) to Cr(III), which could be observed by the XPS results. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

AB In this study, we investigated the use of a natural process called microbial induced calcium carbonate precipitation (MICP) to grow bio-bricks using the urea present in human urine. We first collected fresh urine and stabilized the urine with calcium hydroxide. This prevented any significant loss of urea which a llowed it to then be used for the MICP process. We used Sporosarcina pasteurii bacteria to help drive the MICP process. The bacteria degraded the urea present in the urine to form carbonate ions which then combined with the calcium ions present in the urine solution to produce calcium carbonate. This calcium carbonate was then used as a bio-cement to glue loose sand particles together in the shape of a brick. The maximum compressive strength we obtained for a bio-brick was 2.7 MPa which compares well with conventionally made bricks. We successfully showed that human urine can be used to manufacture biobricks thus offering an additional use of human urine. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In this study, landfill sludge (LS) was excavated from a 10 year old full-scale sludge landfill and used to investigate effects of dosage on sludge dewaterability, rheological properties and extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) variations by FeCl3-lime conditioning. LS had lower content of organic matters (0.28) and smaller particle size than excess sludge (ES), and greatly lower viscosity and high flowability. The suitable concentration of LS for conditioning (107.2-118.6 g/L) was much higher than that of ES (34 g/L) by rheological analysis. Both FeCl3 and lime improved dewaterability of LS and caused decline of slime and loosely bound EPS (LB-EPS). FeCl3 destroyed proteins in slime and LB-EPS owing to coagulation and acidification effects, weakened internal structure strength, and thus improved dewaterability. Lime addition caused alkaline hydrolysis of polysaccharides in slime and LB-EPS, reduced viscosity and flowability, and improved flowability and dewaterability for LS. The optimal dosage for dewatering using 57.6 mg lime/g dried solids (DS) and 53.6 mg FeCl3/g DS was obtained by using an integrative response surface methodology (RSM) coupled nonlinear programming approach under water content constraint of 55%. The integrative optimization achieved 26.0% cost saving in comparison to RSM optimized condition. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In this study, enhanced nitrogen removal through in situ enrichment of anammox bacteria was successfully obtained in a full-scale municipal wastewater treatment plant (WWTP). The WWTP was an anaerobic-anoxic-oxic (AAO) process and upgraded by adding moving carriers into the anoxic zone. Enhanced nitrogen removal was obtained during almost two years of operation. The significant nitrogen removal might be associated with the in situ enrichment of anammox bacteria on the adding carriers, as revealed by the comprehensive results of molecular analysis and N-15-stable isotope tracing tests. Quantitative PCR results indicated that anammox bacteria in the anoxic-carrier biofilms presented a higher abundance than flocculent sludge (16S rRNA: P < 0.005; HzsB: P < 0.042). The 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing showed significant differences in the phylum Planctomycetes (P < 0.001) between anoxic-carrier biofilms and flocculent sludge. And metagenomic sequencing analysis further revealed the anammox relative abundance in the anoxic-carrier biofilms was significantly higher than the reported level in the flocculent sludge of conventional WWTPs. In addition, N-15-stable isotope tracing tests showed that anammox could be combined with nitrate reduction by the anoxic-carrier biofilms. Thus, enriched anammox bacteria might contribute to nitrogen loss and lead to improvements in the nitrogen removal, which was also supported by the mass balance analysis of organic carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus of the WWTP. Overall, this study suggests that anoxic-carrier biofilms might be a candidate to enhance nitrogen removal through partial anammox in municipal WWTPs. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Pre-chlorination and UV disinfection are two common processes in drinking water treatment plants. Sulfamethoxazole (SMX), an antibiotic widely detected in source water, was selected as a precursor to study the conversion of chlorine/nitrogen species and DBP formation in pre-chlorination/post-UV process. The combined chlorine (mainly organic chloramines) produced in pre-chlorination of SMX can self-degrade and release free chlorine back again as pre-chlorination time goes on. With free chlorine dose increasing, the self-degradation rate of combined chlorine increased obviously. But the combined chlorine stopped self-degrading and remained stable around 1 mg-Cl-2/L after adding 0.30 mM chlorine for 30 min. Post-UV treatment after pre-chlorination can enhance the degradation and achieve a complete removal of combined chlorine (including organic chloramines). Deamination occurred during prechlorination/post-UV process and deamination amount (-NH2) per SMX concentration was 0.19 M/M. Radicals in this process had no obvious influence on chlorine/nitrogen species conversion. Direct chlorination of SMX had the lowest DBP formation potentials while the application of pre-chlorination and UV enhanced them. Compared with UV treatment only, dichloroacetonitrile formation potential of SMX reduced by 1.58 x 10(-3) mol/mol-SMX (17.37 mu g/l) after pre-chlorination/post-UV treatment. During prechlorination/post-UV/final-chlorination treatment of SMX, Br- and natural organic matter can enhance DBP formation and toxicity-weighted values. Acid conditions showed a very high DBP risk, while alkaline conditions could cut this risk obviously, especially for the toxicity-weighted values of these DBPs. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

AB With the widespread use of oxytetracycline (OTC), residual OTCs have been detected in natural surface waters, as well as in water and wastewater treatment systems. Semiconductor photocatalysis has been proven to be a green and high-performing method for the removal of organic contaminants. However, most photocatalysts are only effective when irradiated by UV light. This study explores the efficiency of a new semiconductor photocatalysis method for OTC removal under solar and visible light. To expand the spectral range from the UV to the visible region, a facile prepared ball-like TiO2 at graphene oxide (TiO2@GO) composite, a TiO2-associated catalyst, was synthesized. Chemical characterization indicated that the TiO2@GO has the features of both TiO2 and GO, with the regular TiO2 fiber balls cladded by GO nanosheets. The photocatalytic activity of TiO2@GO composites under solar and visible light was evaluated in terms of OTC degradation. Values of 100% and 90% OTC removal efficiencies were achieved with TiO2@GO at 6 mg/L under solar and visible light irradiation, respectively. The band structure of TiO2@GO expanded the spectral range to full light wavelengths, facilitating formation of a light-induced electron hole (h(+)), which was identified in this study as the major cause of OTC degradation. The pH and TSS levels (>100 mg/L) were found to have high and low impacts, respectively, on the removal efficiency of OTC, while natural organic matter (NOM) was found to have an insignificant impact. Furthermore, the degradation of OTC with catalysis by TiO2@GO was verified using two real water samples, and averages of 90% and 75% OTC removal efficiencies were achieved under solar and visible light respectively. The results indicate that the synthesized TiO2@GO composites can provide an effective way of removing toxic organic compounds, including OTC, from the water system. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Phosphorus (P) is the main nutrient that causes eutrophication in fresh waters. The majority of P in lake ecosystems is usually stored in the bottom sediment, hence P cycling from the sediment into the water column can significantly and negatively impact water quality. However, sediment nutrients are not taken into account, for instance, in the ecological status assessment determined by the European Water Framework Directive. This encourages lake managers to improve the water quality at the expense of the sediment; for example, chemical inactivation of P has been applied to the sediment in numerous lakes for rapid water quality improvement While this may generate immediate results, inactivation of sediment P may in fact delay the long-term recovery of lake ecosystems and inhibit the re-use of nutrients. In some specific cases, these rapid restoration efforts that compromise sediment quality are justified. Nevertheless, we should aim for a general strategy that can promote permanent recovery of lake ecosystems - including their sediments. The support for such restoration activities may be difficult to find, since the tangible outcome is realized only after long periods of time. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Although photochemical transformation is a major degradation pathway for antibiotics in surface freshwaters, the photodegradation of antibiotics from freshwaters downstream into seawater is largely unknown. Herein, sulfadiazine was adopted as a representative antibiotic to probe the alteration of photolytic kinetics along freshwater to seawater sampled from Qinzhou Bay, China. The results showed th at the photodegradation rate constants of sulfadiazine significantly increased in estuarine waters along freshwaters to seawaters. Experiments in synthetic water samples with isolated local dissolved organic m atter (IL-DOM) indicated that the increased photodegradation of sulfadiazine is attributed to the integrative effect of both IL-DOM and halide ions. Radical quenching experiments with tert-butanol (quenching of center dot OH) and isopropanol (quenching of both center dot OH and reactive halogen species, RHS) demonstrated that RHS are largely responsible for the halide-specific enhancement in the photo-degradat ion of sulfadiazine, rather than other reactive species, such as triplet-excited IL-DOM and center dot OH. However, triplet-excited IL-DOM was involved in the production of RHS by the oxidation of halide ions by the triplet-excited states. Experiments conducted with DOM analogues verified DOM-sensitized RHS formation, and the degradation induced by RHS is positively correlated with the triplet-excited reduction potentials of DOM analogues. These findings are helpful in deeply understanding the transformation of antibiotics, and demonstrate the importance of RHS-induced degradation in antibiotics fate models in estuarine water systems.

AB Forward osmosis (FO) has been adopted to treat complex wastewater such as landfill leachate due to its high rejection of organics. In this study, the in-line adsorptive process using biochar (BC) or powdered activated carbon (PAC) was applied to a cross flow FO system to enhance the mitigation of the FO membrane fouling from landfill leachate. The changes in the leachate composition along the treatments were tracked by excitation emission matrix-parallel factor analysis (EEM-PARAFAC) to identify tryptophan-like (C1), fulvic-like (C2), and humic-like (C3) components. After a single operation of FO, the Cl was found to be the main constituent responsible for membrane fouling irrespective of varying operation conditions regarding draw solute concentrations and flow rates. Both sorbents (i.e., BC and PAC) exhibited the preferential removal behavior towards C1 > C2 > C3, which was welt supported by their individual adsorption isotherm model parameters. The addition of in-line adsorption treatment to FO resulted in substantial improvements in the filtered volume (>57%) and the flux recovery (>80%) compared to the single FO operation. Without chemical cleaning of membrane, the flux was fully recovered at a dose of 10 g/L BC or 0.3 g/L of PAC. A significant and negative correlation was found between the flux recovery and the C1 of the feed leachate or the corresponding spectral peak intensity (p < 0.05) for the integrated FO system, suggesting the potential of using on-line fluorescence monitoring for the performance of the integrated system in terms of fouling mitigation. This study provided a new insight into the effectiveness of BC or PAC adsorption as the in-line integration with an FO system for the targeted removal of FO membrane foulants in landfill leachate.

AB Although rivers represent an important pathway for the transport of microplastics to the oceans, research on riverine microplastics is limited compared to the marine environment. Hence, we investigated the spatiotemporal distribution of microplastics in the Nakdong River down to 20 mu m in size and characterized them using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy in surface and mid waters and sediment. The mean (+/- standard deviation) abundance of microplastic in the Nakdong River was in the range of 293 +/- 83 (upstream, February 2017) to 4760 +/- 5242 (downstream, August 2017) particles/m(3) in water, and 1970 +/- 62 particles/kg in sediment. The abundance of microplastics was about three times higher in surface than mid waters in the downstream area. Polypropylene and polyester accounted for 41.8% and 23.1% of microplastics in the water, respectively, whereas about 50% in the sediment was composed of polypropylene and polyethylene. Microplastics smaller than 300 mu m in size accounted for 74% in the water and 81% in sediment, and the distribution peaked in the 50-150 mu m size range. Based on these results, we estimated the annual load of microplastics carried by the Nakdong River in 2017 to be 5.4-11 trillion by number and 53.3-118 tons by weight. The proportions of the total load transported through surface water and the water column were 8% and 92%, respectively. In addition, the microplastic load was concentrated in the wet season, which makes up 71% in number and 81% in weight. These results indicate that it is necessary to reflect seasonal variation and sample both in the surface water and water column to estimate microplastic transport. Without considering these factors, the annual load of microplastics may be overestimated or underestimated. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This study investigated the hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) activation potential of Fe-Mn binary oxides modified bio-char (FeMn/bio-char) for the degradation of naphthalene, the dominant PAHs in drinking water. Results showed that FeMn/bio-char exhibited 80.7- and 2.18-times decomposition rates towards H2O2 than that of pure bio-char and Fe-Mn binary oxides, respectively, and consequently the FeMn/biochar/H2O2 photo-Fenton system presented highest naphthalene removal efficiency. The enhanced catalytic activity could be ascribed to the synergistic effect of the combination of bio-char and Fe-Mn binary oxides, such as promoting the adsorption capacity towards contaminant, increasing concentration of persistent free radicals (PFRs) and introducing Fe-Mn binary oxides as new activator. According to the batch-scale experiments, FeMn/bio-char/H2O2 photo-Fenton system could degrade naphthalene effectively at a wide pH ranges, and 82.2% of naphthalene was degraded under natural pH of 5.6 within 148 min. Free radicals quenching studies and electron spin resonance (ESR) analyses verified that the dominant free radical within FeMn/bio-char/H2O2 photo-Fenton system was hydroxyl radical (center dot OH). According to the preliminary analysis, the generation of center dot OH were ascribed to the activation of H2O2 by Fe (II), Mn (II) and PFRs on the catalyst surface. The mainly degradation intermediates of naphthalene were identified by GC-MS analysis. Consequently, the possible degradation pathways were proposed. Moreover, naphthalene degradation experiments were also conducted in river, tap water, industrial wastewater as well as medical wastewater, and the results indicated that the FeMn/bio-char/H2O2 photo-Fenton system was effective in the treatment of naphthalene in natural waters. This study brings a valuable insight for the potential environmental applications of modified bio-char. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Decentralized wastewater treatment represents a promising sustainable option for future wastewater management. Blacicwater collected from toilets contains high concentrations of organic matter, ideal for energy recovery using anaerobic digestion. Up-flow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB) reactors treating conventional toilet (CT, 9 L water per flush) and vacuum toilet (VT, 1 L water per flush) blackwater with increments of loadings were successfully operated to steady state in three phases. The organic loading rates were maintained at comparable levels between the two reactors. The methanisation rates were 0.23-0.29 and 0.41-0.48 gCH(4)-COD/gfeedCOD in the CT and VT reactors, and the COD removal rates were 72% and 89%, respectively. The enriched microbial consortia and the community dynamics under different loading phases were compared. The rank abundance distributions and alpha-diversity showed that archaeal communities were predominated by mono-enrichments in both CF and VT reactors, while bacterial communities showed lower diversity in the VT reactor. Through principal coordinates analysis (beta-diversity), clear divergences of archaeal and bacterial communities between the CT and VT reactors were revealed, and the archaeal community developed at a slower rate than the bacterial community. The enriched archaea were hydrogenotrophic methanogens, Methanolinea in the CT reactor (56.6%), and Methanogenium in the VT reactor (62.3%). The enriched bacteria were Porphyromonadaceae in both CT (15.9%) and VT (13.4%) reactors, sulfate-reducing bacteria in the CT reactor, and Fibrobacteraceae in the VT reactor (13.8%). Links between enriched consortia and ammonia stress were discussed. isotope fraction analysis of the biogas showed a slight shift from acetoclastic methanogenesis to hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis. A closer look into the predicted metagenomic functional profiles showed agreeing results, where hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis and jhs gene abundances were higher in the VT reactor. We demonstrated that different blackwater types enriched different microbial consortia, probably due to ammonia concentrations and sulfate loadings, which should be taken into consideration for practical applications.

AB Biological removal of organics, nitrogen and from saline wastewaters is adversely impacted by high salinity, which can be a major concern for treatment of industrial or domestic saline wastewater. In anaerobic treatment systems, sulfidogensis, especially when treating sulfate-rich saline wastewaters (e.g. seawater has 930 mgSO(4)-S L-1, or 2800 mgL(-1) as SOi(4)(2-)) can cause additional biological, operational, and safety issues, due to H2S toxicity. Here, the use of anaerobic purple phototrophic bacteria (PPB) is tested as mediator to treat high salinity domestic wastewater (NaCl), and marine wastewater (Red Sea Salt high sulfate, potassium, etc.) in a continuous anaerobic infra-red photo bioreactor, operated over 372d. Saline adapted PPB simultaneously removed COD, nitrogen and phosphorus with biomass yields of 0.8 gCOD gCOD(-1). Batch activity tests found a broad optimum peak for saline adapted PPB between 30 and 70 mS cm(-1), and 50% reduced activity at 140 mS cm(-1) (3.5x seawater). For marine wastewater, high sulfate influent concentrations (770 mgSO(4)-S L-1) did not result in substantial H2S production (<1.6 mgS L-1) over 80 d. When irradiation was removed, sulfide rapidly rose to >90 mgS L-1 and the process failed. The results indicate rapid adaptation to high-salt conditions (both NaCl and marine), and the capacity for PPB to form a combined wastewater treatment/resource recovery process, particularly for salty industrial wastewater.

AB Conventional wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) clean wastewater and minimize water pollution; but, while doing so, they also contribute to air pollution and need energy/material input with associated emissions. However, energy recovery (e.g. anaerobic digestion) and resource recovery (e.g. water reuse) allow us to offset the adverse environmental impacts of wastewater treatment. Life cycle assessments (LCA) have been used more and more to evaluate the environmental impacts of WWTPs and to suggest improvement options. There is a need to search for resource recovery applications that genuinely realize a net-zero impact on the total environment of WWTPs. In this work, a scheme with highly efficient energy and resource recovery (especially for thermal energy) is proposed and evaluated. The environmental impact of a conventional WWTP in comparison with the scheme proposed here, with energy/resource recovery included, was calculated, and discussed with reference to LCA methodology. In the process of using LCA, it was necessary to choose a regional situation to focus on. In this case, a Chinese situation was focused as a reference, but the qualitative information gained is of worldwide relevance. The results clearly revealed that conventional WWTP does not benefit the total environment as a whole while the new scheme benefited the total environment via resource/energy recovery-based processes. Among others, thermal energy recovery played a significant role towards a net-zero LCA analysis (contributing around 40%) which suggests that more attention and research should be focused on it.

AB Quantitative Structure Biodegradation Relationships (QSBRs) are a tool to predict the biodegradability of chemicals. The objective of this work was to generate reliable biodegradation data for mono-aromatic chemicals in order to evaluate and verify previously developed QSBRs models. A robust biodegradation test method was developed to estimate specific substrate utilization rates, which were used as a proxy for biodegradation rates of chemicals in pure culture. Five representative mono-aromatic chemicals were selected that spanned a wide range of biodegradability. Aerobic biodegradation experiments were performed for each chemical in batch reactors seeded with known degraders. Chemical removal, degrader growth and CO2 production were monitored over time. Experimental data were interpreted using a full carbon mass balance model, and Monod kinetic parameters (Y, K-s, q(max) and mu(max)) for each chemical were determined. In addition, stoichiometric equations for aerobic mineralization of the test chemicals were developed. The theoretically estimated biomass and CO2 yields were similar to those experimentally observed; 35% (s.d +/- 8%) of the recovered substrate carbon was converted to biomass, and 65% (s.d +/- 8%) was mineralised to CO2. Significant correlations were observed between the experimentally determined specific substrate utilization rates, as represented by q(max) and q(max)/K-s, at high and low substrate concentrations, respectively, and the first order biodegradation rate constants predicted by a previous QSBR study. Similarly, the correlation between q(max) and selected molecular descriptors characterizing the chemicals structure in a previous QSBR study was also significant. These results suggest that QSBR models can be reliable and robust in prioritising chemical half-lives for regulatory screening purposes. (C) 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB The sulfidogenic process driven by sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) is not suitable for mercury-contaminated wastewater treatment due to the highly toxic methyl-mercury (MeHg) produced by SRB. In our previous study, we observed in short-term batch tests that sulfur-reducing bacteria ((SRB)-R-0) could remove mercury ions without MeHg production. Thus, the aim of this study is to develop a biological sulfur reduction process driven by (SRB)-R-0 for mercury-contaminated wastewater, and investigate its long-term performance on mercury removal and MeHg accumulation. Receiving mercury-contaminated wastewater containing 0-50 mg Hg(II)/L for 326 days, (SRB)-R-0 in the sulfur-reducing bioreactor showed high tolerance with mercury toxicity, and removed 99.4% +/- 1.4% of the influent Hg(II) by biogenic sulfide. MeHg was always found to be undetectable in the bioreactor, even though the sulfidogenic bacteria were exposed to high levels of Hg(II) in long-term trials. The result of qPCR analysis further revealed that the mercury-methylation functional gene (hgcA) concentration in the bioreactor sludge was found to be extremely lower than in the SRB-enriched sludge, Geobacter sulfurreducens PCA and Desulfomicrobium baculatum DSM 4028, implying that there was no or few mercury methylators in the bioreactor. In short, the biological sulfur reduction process using (SRB)-R-0 can efficiently treat mercury-contaminated wastewater, with high Hg(II) removal efficiency and no MeHg accumulation.

AB Ultraviolet light-emitting diodes (UV-LEDs) are promising alternatives to conventional low-pressure UV (LPUV) lamps, mainly because they contain no toxic mercury and have a potential for less energy consumption and longer lifetime. In this study, UV sources including UV-LEDs (265, 275 and 285 nm) and LPUV (254 nm) were compared in UV/chlorine degradation of an organic contaminant, ronidazole (RNZ). UV-LED/chlorine performed better than LPUV/chlorine at neutral and alkaline pH values for RNZ degradation considering the fluence-based rate constant. However, the wall plug efficiencies of UV-LEDs are relatively low at present and must reach about 20-25% to achieve the same electrical energy per order as the LPUV in UV/chlorine degradation of RNZ at pH 7.5 and 9. Neither the contribution of radical (HO center dot or Cl center dot) nor the quantum yield of chlorine could explain the different RNZ degradation rate by UV/chlorine at different wavelengths and pH values, while the chlorine photolysis rate should be the key factor for these phenomena. The effects of common co-existing substances in real water (chloride, bicarbonate and natural organic matter) on UV/chlorine degradation of RNZ were similar at different UV wavelengths. Opposite to other oxidants or reductants, the molar absorption coefficient of chlorine increases when the UV wavelength increases from 254 to 285 nm at neutral and alkaline pH, which makes UV-LED/chlorine one of the best choices for UV-LED-based advanced oxidation/reduction processes.

AB The alternative disinfectant chloramine can lower the formation of carbonaceous DBPs (C-DBPs) but promote the formation of nitrogenous DBPs (N-DBPs), which are more cytotoxic and genotoxic. In this study, the combination of thermally activated persulfate pre-oxidation and post-chloramination (TA/PS-NH2Cl) was proposed to control the formation and reduce the toxicity of both C-DBPs and N-DBPs. The formation, speciation and toxicity of trihalomethanes, haloacetic acids, haloaldehydes, haloacetonitriles, halonitromethanes and haloacetamides, collectively defined as CX3R-type DBPs, under TA/PS-NH2Cl process were compared with processes of chlorination alone (Cl-2), chloramination alone (NH2Cl) and coupled thermally activated persulfate pre-oxidation with post-chlorination (TA/PS-Cl-2). Results showed that chloramination could reduce formation of C-DBPs and total organic halogen (TOX) while increase NDBP formation, and the introduction of TA/PS pretreatment process slightly increased the formation of CDBPs and TOX but sharply reduced the formation of N-DBPs with higher toxicity as well as brominated CX3R-type DBPs that are more toxic than their chlorinated analogues. By comprehensive toxicity calculation, an outright decline of both cytotoxicity and genotoxicity risk of CX3R-type DBPs was observed during TA/PS-NH2Cl process compared with Cl-2, NH2Cl, and TA/PS-Cl-2 processes. In summary, TA/PS-NH2Cl process was a potential effective method for integrally controlling the formation of CX3R-type DBPs and their toxicity and is suggested to be used to treat raw waters containing no bromide or low levels of bromide considering bromate caused by TA/PS pre-oxidation. The study may provide a feasible and economical method for DBP control on the background of global warming. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Unintended effects of engineering agents and materials on the formation of undesirable disinfection byproducts (DBPs) during drinking water treatment and distribution were comprehensively reviewed. Specially, coagulants, biologically active filtration biofilms, activated carbons, nanomaterials, ionexchange resins, membrane materials in drinking water treatment and piping materials, deposits and biofilms within drinking water distribution systems were discussed, which may serve as DBP precursors, transform DBPs into more toxic species, and/or catalyze the formation of DBPs. Speciation and quantity of DBPs generated rely heavily on the material characteristics, solution chemistry conditions, and operating factors. For example, quaternary ammonium polymer coagulants can increase concentrations of N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) to above the California notification level (10 ng/L). Meanwhile, the application of strong base ion-exchange resins has been associated with the formation of N-nitrosamines and trichloronitromethane up to concentrations of 400 ng/L and 9.0 mu g/L, respectively. Organic compounds leaching from membranes and plastic and rubber pipes can generate high NDMA (180-450 ng/L) and chloral hydrate (similar to 12.4 mu g/L) upon downstream disinfection. Activated carbon and membranes preferentially remove organic precursors over bromide, resulting in a higher proportion of brominated DBPs. Copper corrosion products (CCPs) accelerate the decay of disinfectants and increase the formation of halogenated DBPs. Chlorination of high bromide waters containing CCPs can form bromate at concentrations exceeding regulatory limits. Owing to the aforementioned concern for the drinking water quality, the application of these materials and reagents during drinking water treatment and distribution should be based on the removal of pollutants with consideration for balancing DBP formation during disinfection scenarios. Overall, this review highlights situations in which the use of engineering agents and materials in drinking water treatment and distribution needs balance against deleterious impacts on DBP formation.

AB In-stream attenuation of dissolved and particulate forms of carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus are a crucial ecosystem service, especially in watercourses downstream of chemical pollution point-sources (i.e. wastewater treatment plants). Most chemical-fate models assume that attenuation is directly proportional to the concentration of available dissolved organic carbon, and inorganic nitrogen and phosphorus compounds in watercourses, but there are multiple evidences of saturation and even inhibition of attenuation at higher concentrations. Our current comprehension of nutrient attenuation kinetics in streams remains a limiting factor for the development and calibration of predictive models of the chemical fate of these compounds in rivers, thus hindering the development and implementation of more effective regulatory strategies. Here, we assessed the in-stream attenuation of dissolved organic carbon, inorganic nitrogen (NH4+, NO2-, NO3-) and phosphorus (PO43-) compounds at increasing concentrations of these compounds, and analyzed the interaction between attenuation kinetics and biofilm structure and function. Specifically, the net balances of these compounds were assessed in artificial streams exposed to eight treatments following the gradient of WWTP contribution to the river flow (0, 14, 29, 43, 58, 72, 86, and 100% of WWTP effluent water). Results indicate that biological in-stream attenuation by a given biofilm of an effluent dominated watercourse might be saturated if exposed for short periods to high nutrient concentrations such as during combined sewer overflow events, but that communities can adapt if exposed long enough to high concentrations, therefore avoiding or at least minimizing saturation. More attention should be therefore given to the management of effluent-dominated watercourses, as reductions in the temporal variability of the discharged wastewater by WWTP might enhance attenuation and thus reduce water quality issues downstream.

AB The wide application of chlorine disinfectant for drinking water treatment has led to the appearance of chlorine-resistant bacteria, which pose a severe threat to public health. This study was performed to explore the physiological-biochemical characteristics and environmental influence (pH, temperature, and turbidity) of seven strains of chlorine-resistant bacteria isolated from drinking water. Ozone disinfection was used to investigate the inactivation effect of bacteria and spores. The DNA concentration and cell surface structure variations of typical chlorine-resistant spores (Bacillus cereus spores) were also analysed by real-time qPCR, flow cytometry, and scanning electron microscopy to determine their inactivation mechanisms. The ozone resistance of bacteria (Aeromonas jandaei < Vogesella perlucida < Pelomonas < Bacillus cereus <Aeromonas sobria) was lower than of spores (Bacillus alvei < Lysinibacillus fusiformis < Bacillus cereus) at an ozone concentration of 1.5 mg/L. More than 99.9% of Bacillus cereus spores were inactivated by increasing ozone concentration and treatment duration. Moreover, the DNA content of Bacillus cereus spores decreased sharply, but approximately 1/4 of the target genes remained. The spore structure exhibited shrinkage and folding after ozone treatment. Both cell structures and gene fragments were damaged by ozone disinfection. These results showed that ozone disinfection is a promising method for inactivating chlorine-resistant bacteria and spores in drinking water. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Contaminants in sewer overflows can contribute to exceedances of environmental quality standards, thus the quantification of contaminants during rainfall events is of relevance. However, monitoring is challenged by i) high spatiotemporal variability of contaminants in events of hard-to-predict durations, and ii) a large number of remote sites, which would imply enormous efforts with traditional sampling equipment. Therefore, we evaluate the applicability of passive samplers (Empore styrene-divinylbenzene reverse phase sulfonated (SDB-RPS)) to monitor a set of 13 polar organic contaminants. We present calibration experiments at high temporal resolution to assess the rate limiting accumulation mechanisms for short events (<36 h), report parameters for typical sewer conditions and compare passive samplers with composite water samples in a field study (three locations, total 10 events). With sampling rates of 0.35-3.5 L/d for 1 h reference time, our calibration results indicate a high sensitivity of passive samplers to sample short, highly variable sewer overflows. The contaminant uptake kinetic shows a fast initial accumulation, which is not well represented with the typical first-order model. Our results indicate that mass transfer to passive samplers is either controlled by the water boundary layer and the sorbent, or by the sorbent alone. Overall, passive sampler concentration estimates are within a factor 0.4 to 3.1 in comparison to composite water samples in the field study. We conclude that passive samplers are a promising approach to monitor a large number of discharge sites although it cannot replace traditional stormwater quality sampling in some cases (e.g. exact load estimates, high temporal resolution). Passive samplers facilitate identifying and prioritizing locations that may require more detailed investigations. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The application and fate of antibiotics are closely related to human health and the ecological balance, which has gradually aroused the widespread global concerns. Long-term antibiotic residues can easily induce antibiotic resistance and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in the environment. Although many studies have investigated the metabolic pathways of biosynthesis or degradation of oxytetracycline (OTC) and its influencing factors under laboratory or controlled conditions, the understanding of OTC degradation pathways and influencing factors in the environment is still poor. In the present study, the role of Pseudomonas (T4) in OTC biodegradation were investigated with different carbon sources, metal ions, substrate concentrations, temperatures, and pH values, as well as the temporal changes in the relative abundance of OTC ARGs. It was found that OTC could be degraded by T4 as a sole carbon source. Comparison with Cu2+, the addition of Fe3+ could significantly promote the growth of T4, and then increased the OTC degradation percentage to 65.3%. The initial concentration of OTC, temperature, and pH had significant impacts on OTC degradation. At the initial OTC concentration of 50 mg L-1, the percentage degradation of OTC by T4 could reach 81.0% at the presence of Fe3+, and at 40 degrees C and pH = 7. Common tetracycline ARGs were not found during the OTC degradation by T4 in the present study. The eight main putative OTC degradation byproducts were identified by ultra-high definition accurate-mass quadrupole time-of-flight tandem mass spectrometry (QTOF/MS). Six different reaction types and seven possible degradation pathways were proposed, including enol-ketone conversion, hydroxylation, dehydration, deamination, demethylation and decarbonylation. Under optimal conditions, the OTC degradation percentages by T4 could reach to 88.2%, 91.6% and 92.0% in pond water, fish wastewater and industrial wastewater, respectively. These results demonstrate the high effectiveness of T4 at the presence of Fe3+ for the enhanced biodegradation of OTC in water environment, without resulting in the occurrence of ARGs. This has important implications for the removal of OTC from aquatic environments by the technology proposed from this study. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Contamination of water by fecal matter and potential human enteric pathogens is a serious health concern. Microbiological water quality has been assessed by conventional culture-based methods of fecal indicator bacteria (FIB). Recently, molecular techniques for FIB have been introduced as alternative tools for rapid detection. However, such molecular techniques require a modern laboratory setting, expensive equipment, and skilled personnel. In this study, we developed a simple and rapid DNA extraction method based on a syringe filter without any specialized equipment. Furthermore, loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) PCR for fecal indicator bacteria (FIB) (i.e. E. coli and E. faecalis) was carried out using the DNA extracts from the syringe-filter based DNA extraction method. The efficiency of the extracted DNA from the syringe-filter based method was comparable to the results of the commercial kit method. We also tested fresh and marine-water collected directly from different locations in Singapore that were spiked with E. coli or E. faecalis. The LAMP assays combined with our DNA extraction method showed higher sensitivity and more tolerance to PCR inhibitors than that of conventional PCR methods. We further developed a portable LAMP device to conduct isothermal PCR reactions for rapid on-site measurement of FIB. As the color changes in the end point of the LAMP reaction can be observed with the naked eye, the portable LAMP device was easily operated and quick, obtaining results in 30 min. The simple, portable and user-friendly platform can be used as an initial screening for the rapid detection of the presence FIB in lower-resource settings. In conclusion, the portable LAMP device coupled with a syringe-filter based DNA extraction method enables us to detect the presence of FIB for assessing microbial water quality within 1 h without any sophisticated laboratory equipment or highly trained personnel.

AB A simple balancing method using passive samplers over a week's period has been developed and tested successfully to determine elimination rates of 22 common micropollutants of household and industrial sources in 18 full-scale wastewater treatment plants of different design and performance. Independent reactor tests to delineate elimination rates with native sludge of the treatment plants correlated very well with the full-scale elimination rate determinations. As opposed to common assumptions, this large dataset indicated that shorter sludge retention times - read: higher active biomass - showed higher micropollutant elimination rates in many cases. Multivariate statistical analysis of the elimination rates over the 18 treatment plants was able to group compounds according to common degradation pathways and showed that sensitivity to SRT drove the grouping. The dataset also allowed to determine population equivalent normalized loads of the investigated micropollutants. The application of WWTP balancing with passive sampling makes it relatively easy to gather elimination rates and inlet loads on a much broader basis than before and gives orientation for more in-depth analysis of degradation pathways.

AB Biological nitrogen removal from mature landfill leachate is ineffective due to the extremely low carbon/nitrogen (C/N) ratio. Moreover, a large amount of waste activated sludge (WAS) is inevitably generated from WWIPs during the municipal sewage treatment process. In this study, an innovative process was developed to enhance nitrogen removal from low C/N (1:1) mature landfill leachate and to reduce the WAS during a 300-day operation. Two sequencing batch reactors (SBRs) were involved in this process. Firstly, the mature landfill leachate was pumped into an aerobic reactor to undergo partial nitrification (PN-SBR). Then, the PN-SBR effluent and WAS were pumped into an anoxic reactor to undergo integrated fermentation and denitritation (IFD-SBR). The pH profile was treated as a real-time parameter to pre-cisely control the duration of the PN and IFD processes. partial nitrification and integrated fermentation denitritation (PNIFD) system achieved a total nitrogen removel efficiency of 95.0% and an average nitrogen removal rate (NRR) of 0.63 kg/m(3).d during the last operational phase. Due to a variety of refractory contaminants, the effluent COD concentration was 1865.9 mg/L and a 19.7% COD removal efficiency was obtained under an influent concentration of 2324.5 mg/L Compared with the traditional nitrogen removal process, PNIFD not only decreased requirements for oxygen by 25% and the external or ganic carbon by 100%, but also achieved simultaneous reduction of external WAS. More than 53.7% of the external sludge was reduced during the IFD-SBR operational cycle, with an average external sludge reduction rate (SRR) of 5.09 kg/m (3).d. Fermentation/denitritation related microorganisms, such as Anaerolineaceae, Acidimicrobiaceae and Thauera, accounted for up to 41.5% of the total abundance in the IFD-SBR. Based on the long and stable operation, this study provides a simple and promising approach for synchronous nitrogen removal and WAS reduction. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB N-doped biochars (NBCs) were prepared by pyrolyzing corncob biomass and urea in different proportion which manifested superior catalytic performance of peroxydisulfate (PDS) activation for sulfadiazine (SDZ) degradation. Through both dynamic fitting and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, the critical role of edge nitrogenation in biochar (BC) structure was revealed for the first time. The incorporation of edge nitrogen configurations (pyridinic N and pyrrolic N rather than graphitic N) generated reactive sites for the PDS activation. Additionally, a thorough investigation was conducted to explicate the PDS activation mechanism by NBC through chemical quenching experiments, electron spin resonance (ESR) detection, oxidant consumption monitoring and electrochemical analysis. Different from the well-reported singlet oxygen (O-1(2)) dominated nonradical mechanism, an electron transfer pathway involving surface-bound reactive complexes was proved to play a major role in the NBC/PDS system. Benefit from the electron transfer mechanism, the NBC/PDS system not only has wide pH adaptation for real application, but also shows high resistance to the inorganic anions in aquatic environment. We believe this study will deepen the understanding of the carbon-driven persulfate activation mechanism and provide strong technical support for the BC-mediated persulfate activation in practical applications.

AB Bioassays with sea urchin embryos are widely used to define the environmental quality of marine waters. Anomalies during embryogenesis are generally considered as end-points, whereas a toxigenomic approach, despite it is wide use in other species, is yet in its infancy. In the present study we evaluated toxigenic effects induced by copper on the sea urchin Paracentrotus lividus embryo, combining morphological observations with gene expression analysis. Many anthropogenic activities release copper in the marine environment, with harmful effects on aquatic organisms. In the present study P. lidivus embryos were exposed to different concentrations of copper (24, 36, 48 mu g/L) and the activation of fifty specific marker genes, involved in different biological processes (stress, skeletogenesis, development/differentiation, detoxification) was investigated at early blastula, late gastrula and pluteus stage. At blastula stage no morphological anomalies were found, with early down-regulation of genes involved in development/differentiation and a moderate up-regulation of some detoxification genes. At gastrula stage a slight increase in developmental anomalies (up to 19% of malformed embryos) was followed by an increased number of targeted genes belonging to the same two classes, relative to the blastula stage. At pluteus stage morphological anomalies increased in a dose dependent manner. All the analyzed genes were strongly up-regulated, stress and skeletogenic genes showing a "late response" and almost all genes were targeted by copper at all the concentrations tested. The present study represents the first molecular report on the potential negative effect of copper on P. lividus embryos in the environment. Gene expression analysis should be considered as a promising tool for future environmental biomonitoring programs. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Different from current nutrient recovery technologies of recovering one or two nutrient components (PO43- or NH4+) from wastewater, this study aimed to fractionate various nutrient anions and cations simultaneously, including PO43-, SO42-, NH4+, K+, Mg2+ and Ca2+, into several streams. The recovered streams could be further paired together to produce high-value products. A novel electrodialysis process was developed by integrating monovalent selective anion and cation exchange membranes into an electrodialysis stack. Results revealed that nutrient recovery was achieved effectively by fractionating PO43- and SO42- into the anionic product stream, whereas bivalent cations (Mg2+ and Ca2+) were extracted in the cationic product stream and the monovalent cations (K+ and NH4+) were concentrated in the brine stream. For the permeation capabilities of anions, SO42- and Cl- possessed the higher preference, whereas PO43- permeated the membrane more difficult. As to the cations, the permeation sequence was: NH4+ approximate to K+ >Ca2+>Mg2+ approximate to Na+. Enhancing voltage values not only promoted ion migration rates, but also led to the increase of energy consumption. Although elevating initial phosphate concentration in the anionic product streams from 60 mg/L to 470 mg/L did not influence phosphate fractionation significantly, the current efficiency decreased from 3.55% to 0.65% and a remarkable increased of energy consumption from 29.42 kWh/kg NaH2PO4 to 160.13 kWh/kg NaH2PO4 was observed. Further experiments were conducted for phosphorus recovery by pairing two recovered product streams, which revealed that phosphate precipitation could be achieved by using inherent Ca2+ and Mg2+ in the wastewater without dosing external cation sources.

AB Electrochemical water treatment is a promising alternative for small-scale and remote water systems that lack operational capacity or convenient access to reagents for chemical coagulation and disinfection. In this study, the mitigation of viruses was investigated using electrocoagulation as a pretreatment prior to electrooxidation treatment using boron-doped diamond electrodes. This research is the first to investigate a sequential electrocoagulation-electrooxidation treatment system for virus removal. Bench-scale, batch reactors were used to evaluate mitigation of viruses in variable water quality via: a) electrooxidation, and b) a sequential electrocoagulation-electrooxidation treatment train. Electrooxidation of two bacteriophages, MS2 and Phi X174, was inhibited by natural organic matter and turbidity, indicating the probable need for pretreatment. However, the electrocoagulation-electrooxidation treatment train was beneficial only in the model surface waters employed. In model groundwaters, electrocoagulation alone was as good or better than the combined electrocoagulation-electrooxidation treatment train. Reduction of human echovirus was significantly lower than one or both bacteriophages in all model waters, though bacteriophage Phi X174 was a more representative surrogate than MS2 in the presence of natural organic matter and turbidity. Compared to conventional treatment by ferric salt coagulant and free chlorine disinfection, the electrocoagulation-electrooxidation system was less effective in model surface waters but more effective in model groundwaters. Sequential electrocoagulation-electrooxidation was beneficial for some applications, though practical considerations may currently outweigh the benefits. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Technologies capable of selective removal of target contaminants from water are highly desirable to achieve "fit-for-purpose" treatment. in this study, we developed a simple yet highly effective method to achieve calcium-selective removal in an electrosorption process by coating the cathode with a calcium-selective nanocomposite (CSN) layer using an aqueous phase process. The CSN coating consisted of nano-sized calcium chelating resins with aminophosphonic groups in a sulfonated polyvinyl alcohol hydrogel matrix, which accomplished a Ca2+-over-Na+ selectivity of 3.5-5.4 at Na+:Ca2+ equivalent concentration ratio from 10:1 to 1:1, 94 - 184% greater than the uncoated electrode. The CSN coated electrode exhibited complete reversibility in repeated operation. Mechanistic studies suggested that the CSN coating did not contribute to the adsorption capacity, but rather allowed preferential permeation of Ca2+ and hence increased Ca2+ adsorption on the carbon cathode. The CSN-coated electrode was very stable, showing reproducible performance in 60 repeated cycles. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This study investigates the efficiency of anaerobically-digested sludge (ADS) conditioning using peroxymonosulfate (PMS) activated by EDTA chelated-Fe2+ process (PMS-EDTA-Fe2+), and the roles and mechanism of EDTA are explored by investigating the capillary suction time (CST), specific resistance to filtration (SRF), bound water content (BWC), extracellular polymeric substances (EPS), iron species transformation, sludge morphology, and active radicals formation. PMS-EDTA-Fe2+ process exhibits better performance in sludge dewatering than PMS-Fe2+ process. Upon the introduction of EDTA at optimum molar ratio of EDTA to Fe2+ (R(EDTA:Fe)2+) of 1 : 3, CST, SRF, and BWC are decreased by 60.0%, 70.6%, and 1.5%, and the cell viability is decreased from 75.4% to as low as 24.7%. EDTA introduction significantly enhances the yield of active radicals (i.e., SO4-center dot and (OH)-O-center dot) by nearly 50% as compared to PMS-Fe2+ process. This effect contributes to stronger cells lysis as indicated by SEM and CLSM, and the contents of polysaccharide and protein in total EPS fractions are increased by 19.2% and 37.4% accordingly. Additionally, EDTA increases the iron mobility by forming Fe-II/III-EDTA complexes and potentially inhibits ADS coagulation at high doses. The total dissolved iron (Fe-Tot_(dis)) concentration increases from 203.4 mg/L to 601.4 mg/L due to the introduction of EDTA at 0.4 mmol/g VSS, and the dominant iron species in supernatant transformed from Fe2+ to Fe3+ accordingly. The optimization of EDTA doses is significant to balance oxidation and coagulation effects and to achieve better dewatering performance. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Water is one of the possible transmission routes for water- and foodborne parasites to humans. Echinococcus multilocularis is a parasite, which causes alveolar echinococcosis (AE). Nevertheless, no environmental studies have been performed as yet to confirm the occurrence of E. multilocularis in water supplies. Accordingly, 105 water samples of 50 L volume were collected from surface waters (lakes, rivers, canals) and wells in the Warmia-Masuria Province (Echinococcus endemic area) and Pomerania Province (Echinococcus non-endemic area), Poland. The water was filtered and subsequently analysed with nested PCR and real-time PCR. E. multilocularis DNA was found in two (1.9%) samples, which originated from two lakes localised in the Warmia-Masuria Province. Sequencing of the positive samples confirmed that the PCR products were fragments of the E. multilocularis mitochondrial 12S rRNA gene. This is the first investigation describing E. multilocularis detection in environmental water samples, using molecular diagnostic tools. The results indicate that water could be considered as a potential source of E. multilocularis infections in humans and animals, in endemic areas. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Routine biosolids monitoring data provides an independent and comprehensive means to estimate water lead release pre-, during and post-Flint Water Crisis (FWC). The mass of potable plumbing-related metals ( i.e., lead, cadmium, copper, nickel and zinc) in sewage biosolids strongly correlated with one another during the FWC (p < 0.05). A simple parametric regression model based on 90th percentile potable water lead measurements (WLL90) from five city-wide citizen science sampling efforts August 2015-August 2017 was strongly correlated to corresponding monthly lead mass in biosolids [Biosolids-Pb (kg) = 0.483 x WLL90 (mu g/L) + 1.79: R-2 = 0.86, p < 0.05]. Although total biosolids lead increased just 14% during the 18 months of the FWC versus the comparable time pre-FWC, 76% of that increase occurred in July -September 2014, and the corresponding percentage of Flint children under 6 years with elevated blood lead >= 5 mu g/dL (i.e., %EBL5) doubling from 3.45% to 6.61% in those same three months versus 2013 (p < 0.05). %EBL5 was not statistically higher during the remaining months of the FWC compared to preFWC or post-FWC. As expected, lead in biosolids during the FWC, when orthophosphate was not added, was moderately correlated with water temperature (R-2 = 0.30, p < 0.05), but not at other times pre- and post-FWC when orthophosphate was present. Tripling the orthophosphate dose post-FWC versus pre-FWC and some lead pipe removal, decreased lead in biosolids (and %EBLS) to historic lows (2016-2017 vs. 2012-2013; p < 0.05), supporting the effectiveness of these public health interventions in reducing childhood water lead exposure.

AB The rate at which organic contaminants can be degraded in aquatic environments is not only dependent upon specific degrading bacteria, but also upon the composition of the microbial community, mass transfer of the contaminant, and abiotic processes that occur in the environment. In this study, we present three-phase batch experiments of tetrachloroethene (PCE) degradation by a consortium of organohalide-respiring bacteria, cultivated alone or in communities with iron- and/or sulfate-reducers. We developed a modeling approach to quantitatively evaluate the experimental results, comprised of chemical and biomolecular time series data. The model utilizes the IPhreeqc module to couple multiphase mass transfer between gaseous, organic and aqueous phases with microbial and aquatic geochemical processes described using the geochemical code PHREEQC. The proposed approach is able to capture the contaminant degradation, the microbial population dynamics, the effects of multi-phase kinetic mass transfer and sample removal, and the geochemical reactions occurring in the aqueous phase. The model demonstrates the importance of aqueous speciation and abiotic reactions on the bioavailability of the substrates. The model-based interpretation allowed us to quantify the reaction kinetics of the different bacterial guilds. The model further revealed that the inclusion of sulfate-reducing bacteria lowers the rate of PCE degradation and that this effect is moderated in the presence of iron-reducing bacteria.

AB This article provides new evidence on the patent trading flows of small and large firms. We document aggregate patterns of patent sales and acquisitions of small and large firms. We also examine the extent to which the initial innovator's and the potential buyers' prior knowledge stocks in the same technology area and in geographical proximity with a patented invention are associated with the likelihood that the patent is sold, and whether the patent sold is bought by a small or large firm. To do so, we develop a dataset that matches patent sales and information on whether transacted patents are owned by small or large firms following a patent sale.

AB This study examines the relationship between gender diversity and research outcomes. Existing research on the topic primarily focuses on how team gender diversity influences scholarly productivity in terms of citations and publication rates. Far less attention has been devoted to the question of how the intellectual contents of research disciplines change as they become more gender diverse. Drawing on a global sample of more than 25,000 management papers, we use natural language processing techniques, correspondence analysis and regression models to illuminate impact-, content- and status-related dimensions of gender diversity in management research. In regression models adjusting for geographical setting, institutional prestige and collaboration patterns, we find no discernable effects of team gender diversity on per-paper scientific impact. In contrast, our analyses converge to yield a broadly consistent pattern of gender-related variations in research focus: women are well represented in social- and human-centered areas of management, while men comprise the vast majority in areas addressing more technical and operational aspects. Our findings corroborate recent sociological research suggesting that cultural norms and expectations are channeling women and men towards different areas of work and study. We argue that the broadened repertoire of perspectives, values and questions resulting from gender diversity may render management research more responsive to the full gamut of societal needs and expectations.

AB Drawing on data from an original survey of UK and US publicly traded knowledge-intensive business services (KISS) firms, we investigate what types of KIBS firms collaborate with universities and consider the collaboration important for their innovation. First, we find that science-based KIBS firms (those engaged in a science, technology, and innovation [STI] mode of organizational learning), like science-based manufacturing firms, are active collaborators with universities for innovation. This relationship is further enhanced if these firms also provide highly customized services. Second, in contrast to the existing literature suggesting that firms engaged in a doing, using, and interacting (DUI) mode of organizational learning do not regard collaboration with universities as important for their innovation, we find that KIBS firms engaged in a DUI mode of organizational learning and offering highly customized services are active collaborators with universities for innovation, despite the fact that they may not possess highly formalized scientific knowledge. These findings suggest that KIBS firms co-create knowledge with universities differently than manufacturing firms. Moreover, the findings highlight the wide variety of roles that KIBS firms play in innovation networks with universities.

AB This study investigates how research group characteristics relate to the early career success of PhD candidates who are trained in the group. In particular, I study how the citation impact of early-career PhDs is related to the staff composition and funding of the group. Using data on a cohort of Swedish doctoral graduates in science, engineering, mathematics and medicine, two sets of findings are obtained. First, students who were trained in groups with a lower number of PhD students perform better in terms of academic productivity. From the perspective of research policy, this finding suggests a decreasing return to funding additional PhD student positions allocated to professors who are already maintaining larger research groups. Second, PhD students trained in groups with funding for PhD research that is conditioned by funder influence over the topic of thesis research are more likely to stay in academia. Controlling for career destination, however, PhDs from such groups have lower than average scientific productivity and citation impact. These results suggest that finders of PhD studies face a trade-off between the two different funding objectives of "getting what they want" in terms of research content and fostering successful scholars.

AB Using data on the entire population of businesses registered in the states of California and Massachusetts between 1995 and 2011, we decompose the well-established gender gap in entrepreneurship. We show that female led ventures are 63 percentage points less likely than male-led ventures to obtain external funding (i.e., venture capital). The most significant portion of the gap (65 percent) stems from gender differences in initial startup orientation, with women being less likely to found ventures that signal growth potential to external investors. However, the residual gap is as much as 35 percent and much of this disparity likely reflects investors' gendered preferences. Consistent with theories of statistical discrimination, the residual gap diminishes significantly when stronger signals of growth are available to investors for comparable female- and male-led ventures or when focal investors appear to be more sophisticated. Finally, conditional on the reception of external funds (i.e., venture capital), women and men are equally likely to achieve exit outcomes, through IPOs or acquisitions.

AB Only recently have enough women joined senior leadership positions in high tech firms for research on senior management gender diversity in high tech industries to be possible. We propose that senior management gender diversity fosters strategic change in high tech firms, especially under conditions where alliance formation intensity and top management team (TMT) educational background diversity are high, because the breadth of opportunity and knowledge associated with these conditions facilitates implementation of new ideas. Results show that both inter-organizational strategic alliance formation intensity and TMT educational background diversity positively moderate the relationship between senior management gender diversity and strategic change. We also find support for a moderated mediation model whereby a gender-diverse senior management positively impacts strategic change, which ultimately improves firm performance when the firm exhibits high alliance formation intensity and has a TMT that is diverse across educational background.

AB Building on Lee and Malerba's (2017) framework, we explore how leading firms in Brazil's forestry and pulp industry responded to windows of opportunity, in learning terms, shaping an early entry into path-creation technological catch-up, shifting that industry into a globally leading position. Drawing on an in-depth inductive study based on 50 years of evidence, a 10-year fieldwork in large firms, and on a novel approach to micro-level external and internal absorptive capacity (AC), as empirically observable external and internal learning mechanisms (LMs) underlying firms' innovative capability accumulation (technological catch-up), we find that: (1) firms responded to changing windows of opportunity by developing dual AC through the intensity and the manner of use of multiple LMs across the emergence, gradual catch-up, and forging-ahead phases of the path creation process; (2) however, there were variations within and across firms in the effectiveness with which they developed their dual AC over these phases, leading to a non-homogenous technological catch-up: while some firms reached a world-leading capability level, others became fast-followers. We contribute to deepening and refining the understanding of technological catch-up through robust empirical insights on how the dynamic interplay between windows of opportunity and variation in the micro-level dual AC development's effectiveness helps to explain the nature and extent of firms' technological catch-up. We also provide a basis to further the analysis of technological catch-up and its learning processes, particularly in natural resources-rich industries in resource-rich developing countries.

AB UK Research Councils (UKRCs) spend around 3bn pound pa supporting R&D and innovation. We provide a comprehensive assessment of these grants on the performance of participating UK firms, using data on all projects funded by UKRCs over the 2004-2016 period and applying a propensity score matching approach. We exploit the richness of the data available in the Gateway to Research database by investigating the heterogeneous effect of these projects across several novel directions which have not been explored before. We find a positive effect on the employment and turnover growth of participating firms, both in the short and in the medium term. Exploring impacts across different types of firms we find stronger performance impacts for firms in R&D intensive industries and for smaller and less productive firms. We also consider how impacts vary depending on the characteristics of the funded research projects in terms of partners characteristics, receipt of other research grants and grant value. Finally, we focus on the different sources of grants, analysing in particular the evolution in the funding strategy of Innovate UK. Our results have implications for the extent and targeting of future Research Council funding both in the UK and elsewhere.

AB In the innovation process of firms, suppliers increasingly play a key role as external sources of ideas. Although the beneficial impact of supplier integration has been acknowledged, there is also evidence that not all such innovation efforts are successful, particularly regarding the identification of truly innovative solutions. Therefore, in recent years, large firms have begun to move beyond their existing supply base, drawing on innovation ideas from start-ups, that is, with young firms with whom they have no pre-existing bonds. Yet there is no empirical evidence regarding whether start-ups' ideas actually outperform those of established suppliers. We address this question by presenting a unique, real-world comparison of 314 supplier and start-up ideas ideas that were identified, evaluated, and followed up over the course of an open innovation initiative conducted by a large automotive manufacturer. We find that start-ups' ideas are characterized by a higher degree of novelty and to some extent higher benefit for end customers but, on the downside, are less likely to be implemented than suppliers' ideas. Overall, our study adds new dimensions to the discourse on open innovation and provides valuable insights regarding the outcome of supplier and start-up involvement in the front end of the innovation process.

AB In recent years, several organizations have opened up their innovation processes to individuals from outside of the organization by means of digital crowdsourcing. The literature on crowdsourcing has emphasized the importance of using digital technology to reach far beyond organizational boundaries and include individuals with (educational) backgrounds that are very different and unrelated to those within the organization in its innovation process. It has been argued that such individuals will contribute novel insights because they consider an organization's innovation challenge from different perspectives. Building on the literature on creativity and absorptive capacity, we instead argue that having a related perspective will positively affect an individual's idea performance, while unrelated perspectives only positively contribute to idea performance in combination with a related perspective. Analyses of 2178 ideas contributed by 948 crowd members to 68 crowdsourced idea challenges show that it is important to consider how (educational) backgrounds can provide individuals with multiple perspectives, which can be either related or unrelated, and study how the interplay of related and unrelated perspectives affects the value of ideas in organizational open innovation initiatives.

AB Science's main norms prescribe scientists to use citations as acknowledgements of cognitive content irrespective of geographical location. Previous studies, however, suggested that there is a considerable geographical bias in scientific citations. We argue that this geographical bias does not, in itself, falsify the notion that citations reflect acknowledgement of cognitive content, because cognitively related knowledge may be geographically concentrated as well. We analyse the role of organizational, regional and national co-location on citation likelihood for 5.5 million article pairs, and find that the geographical bias in citations is weak once cognitive relatedness is accounted for. Furthermore, we find that the effect of co-location on citation likelihood is strongest at the organizational level, weaker at the regional level, and weakest at the national level. In addition, we show that geographical co-location particularly increases the citation likelihood between two papers when knowledge relatedness between articles is low, suggesting that interdisciplinary research benefits most from co-location. Finally, we find that, when knowledge relatedness is high, the effect of geographical co-location on citation likelihood is non-existent. We discuss the implications regarding policies aimed to discourage strategic citations and to foster interdisciplinary research.

AB Accelerator programs are an increasingly important part of entrepreneurial ecosystems. While accelerators have core defining features-fixed-term, cohort-based educational and mentorship programs for startups- there is also significant variation amongst them. In this paper, we relate key variation in the antecedents, organizational design and operation of these programs to theories of firm-level entrepreneurial performance. We then document descriptive correlations between these design elements and the performance of the startups that attend these programs. In doing so, we probe the connections between design and performance in ways that integrate previously disparate research on accelerators and expand our understanding of startup intermediaries. Our findings delineate the building blocks as well as an agenda for future researchers to build upon not only our understanding of accelerators, but also our understanding of what new ventures need to survive and flourish.

AB Much has been said about the role that technological networking activities play on the innovative performance of firms, but little is known about how the regional context influences the efficiency of such networking activities. In this paper we hypothesize that the transformation of firms' networking activities into innovation may vary depending on the regional environment in which the firm is located. For Spanish manufactures in the period 2000-12 and through the use of a multilevel framework, we obtain that after controlling for the firm's characteristics, the regional context has not only a direct effect on firms' innovation performance, but it also conditions the returns to firms' networking activities, although differently in the case of cooperation and outsourcing. Cooperating in innovation activities is more beneficial for those firms located in a knowledge intensive region, whereas R&D outsourcing seems to be more profitable for firms in regions with a low knowledge pool.

AB Recent studies document a 30-year decline in various measures of entrepreneurship in the U.S. Using detailed Swedish employer-employee data over the period from 1990 to 2013, we find young firms to be more prominent in the Swedish business sector than in the U.S. business sector. Young Swedish firms, aged five years or less, account for more than half of all firms during this period. We also observe an increase in Swedish entrepreneurial activity for start-ups. However, since the mid-2000s, job destruction rates for young firms have been increasing, which implies a declining employment share for younger firms. Moreover, most of the job creation by young firms occurs in the expanding service sector. We discuss different explanations for why Sweden appears not to have the same strong decline in entrepreneurial activity as the U.S. has had during the last two decades. We argue that one important explanation is the economic reforms that were implemented in Sweden in the 1990s that mitigated several hurdles to entrepreneurship.

AB We analyze whether funding bodies are biased against diverse teams, which have often been linked to the production of transformative research. We develop a general framework that compares the drivers of success in the ex-ante grant decision process to the drivers of success in ex-post performance. We use our framework to systematically analyze the decisions of one of the major public funding organizations for scientific research worldwide, the UK's Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC). We find that structurally diverse teams are not only penalized but are also biased against. Indeed, although teams that exhibit greater diversity in knowledge and skills, education, and/or scientific ability, are significantly less likely to obtain funding, they are generally more likely to be successful. Our mediating effects show that the evidence of a bias against diversity is weaker for teams led by prestigious researchers.

AB We study the impact of the European Union Trademark (EUTM), the first pan-European intellectual property right (IPR) title established in 1996. The EUTM drastically reduced the cost of trademark protection, particularly for firms active in many EU member states. As a consequence, the number of marks and the resources spent on protection increased substantially, indicating that there was a large latent demand for IPR protection. Our results suggest that the fragmentation of the EU IPR system, due to the resulting high cost of IPR protection, is an impediment to market entry and innovation, especially for companies operating in smaller EU member states. Our findings are informative for the governance of IPR protection in the EU as well as for plans to harmonize the IPR environment in other trade blocs.

   NETWORKS; GROWTH
AB Quantitative research evaluation requires measures that are transparent, relatively simple, and free of disciplinary and temporal bias. We document and provide a solution to a hitherto unaddressed temporal bias - citation inflation - which arises from the basic fact that scientific publication is steadily growing at roughly 4% per year. Moreover, because the total production of citations grows by a factor of 2 every 12 years, this means that the real value of a citation depends on when it was produced. Consequently, failing to convert nominal citation values into real citation values produces significant mis-measurement of scientific impact. To address this problem, we develop a citation deflator method, outline the steps to generalize and implement it using the Web of Science portal, and analyze a large set of researchers from biology and physics to demonstrate how two common evaluation metrics - total citations and h-index - can differ by a remarkable amount depending on whether the underlying citation counts are deflated or not. In particular, our results show that the scientific impact of prior generations is likely to be significantly underestimated when citations are not deflated, often by 100% or more of the nominal value. Thus, our study points to the need for a systemic overhaul of the counting methods used evaluating citation impact - especially in the case of researchers, journals, and institutions - which can span several decades and thus several doubling periods.

AB In this work, we improve a weakly-compressible SPH method which is based on our previous work of Zhang et al. (2017) [30] by employing a weighted essentially non-oscillatory (WENO) reconstruction. The key idea is to construct along each interacting particle pair a 4-point stencil and to apply a WENO reconstruction for determining the particle interaction with a low-dissipation Riemann solver. Several numerical examples on Taylor-Green vortex flow, dam break and non-linear liquid sloshing demonstrate that the method preserves the capability of producing smooth and accurate pressure fields of the original method and now achieves also very small numerical dissipation.

AB In this paper, we continue our work in [46] and propose a new type of high-order finite volume multi-resolution weighted essentially non-oscillatory (WENO) schemes to solve hyperbolic conservation laws on triangular meshes. Although termed "multi-resolution WENO schemes", we only use the information defined on a hierarchy of nested central spatial stencils and do not introduce any equivalent multi-resolution representation. We construct new third-order, fourth-order, and fifth-order WENO schemes using three or four unequal-sized central spatial stencils, different from the classical WENO procedure using equal-sized biased/central spatial stencils for the spatial reconstruction. The new WENO schemes could obtain the optimal order of accuracy in smooth regions, and could degrade gradually to first-order of accuracy so as to suppress spurious oscillations near strong discontinuities. This is the first time that only a series of unequal-sized hierarchical central spatial stencils are used in designing arbitrary high-order finite volume WENO schemes on triangular meshes. The main advantages of these schemes are their compactness, robustness, and their ability to maintain good convergence property for steady-state computation. The linear weights of such WENO schemes can be any positive numbers on the condition that they sum to one. Extensive numerical results are provided to illustrate the good performance of these new finite volume WENO schemes. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The emergence and understanding of new design paradigms that exploit flow induced mechanical instabilities for propulsion or energy harvesting demands robust and accurate flow structure interaction numerical models. In this context, we develop a novel two dimensional algorithm that combines a Vortex Particle-Mesh (VPM) method and a Multi-Body System (MBS) solver for the simulation of passive and actuated structures in fluids. The hydrodynamic forces and torques are recovered through an innovative approach which crucially complements and extends the projection and penalization approach of Coquerelle et al. [1] and Gazzola et al. [2]. The resulting method avoids time consuming computation of the stresses at the wall to recover the force distribution on the surface of complex deforming shapes. This feature distinguishes the proposed approach from other VPM formulations. The methodology was verified against a number of benchmark results ranging from the sedimentation of a 2D cylinder to a passive three segmented structure in the wake of a cylinder. We then showcase the capabilities of this method through the study of an energy harvesting structure where the stocking process is modeled by the use of damping elements. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

AB A numerical model based on decomposed vaporization mechanisms has been developed for the study of vaporization of liquid droplets with large deformation and high mass transfer rate. In this model, the vaporization-induced volume, energy, and species source terms in the gas phase are modeled using a body-fitted layer placed around the interface on the gas side. In this layer, continuous distributions of volume, energy, and species sources are specified by the conservation laws. A corresponding body-fitted sink layer is placed on the liquid side of the interface to account for mass, energy and species loss in the liquid phase due to vaporization. The formulation retains the advantages of interface localization methods and mitigates the error and complexity caused by the combined treatment of mass/heat transfer and interface localization. The new model is versatile and does not depend on the specific interface localization method, and can thus be implemented in any of the existing methods. As a specific example, the present approach is implemented in a volume-of-fluid (VOF)-based code "Gerris". A number of test cases concerning liquid vaporization in both quiescent and convective environments are presented, with the constant-density assumption, to verify and validate this model in terms of interface localization. In particular, the vaporization of a single n-decane droplet in a uniform air flow of 1000 K at 1 atm is investigated. The predicted liquid volume evolution demonstrates the robustness and accuracy of interface localization for cases with large density ratio and high vaporization rate. Vaporization of n-decane droplets with large deformation and high mass transfer is also investigated systematically. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Bayesian inverse problems highly rely on efficient and effective inference methods for uncertainty quantification (UQ). Infinite-dimensional MCMC algorithms, directly defined on function spaces, are robust under refinement (through discretization, spectral approximation) of physical models. Recent development of this class of algorithms has started to incorporate the geometry of the posterior informed by data so that they are capable of exploring complex probability structures, as frequently arise in UQ for PDE constrained inverse problems. However, the required geometric quantities, including the Gauss-Newton Hessian operator or Fisher information metric, are usually expensive to obtain in high dimensions. On the other hand, most geometric information of the unknown parameter space in this setting is concentrated in an intrinsic finite-dimensional subspace. To mitigate the computational intensity and scale up the applications of infinite-dimensional geometric MCMC (infinity-GMC), we apply geometry-informed algorithms to the intrinsic subspace to probe its complex structure, and simpler methods like preconditioned Crank-Nicolson (pCN) to its geometry-flat complementary subspace.
   In this work, we take advantage of dimension reduction techniques to accelerate the original infinity-GMC algorithms. More specifically, partial spectral decomposition (e.g. through randomized linear algebra) of the (prior or Gaussian-approximate posterior) covariance operator is used to identify certain number of principal eigen-directions as a basis for the intrinsic subspace. The combination of dimension-independent algorithms, geometric information, and dimension reduction yields more efficient implementation, (adaptive) dimension-reduced infinite-dimensional geometric MCMC. With a small amount of computational overhead, we can achieve over 70 times speed-up compared to pCN using a simulated elliptic inverse problem and an inverse problem involving turbulent combustion with thousands of dimensions after discretization. A number of error bounds comparing various MCMC proposals are presented to predict the asymptotic behavior of the proposed dimension-reduced algorithms. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Liu and Jiao proposed a WLS-ENO method (Weighted-Least-Squares based Essentially NonOscillatory). Comparing to the WENO method (Weighted ENO), the WLS-ENO method is more flexible for solving the hyperbolic conservation laws. Notice that, a WLS problem is generated for each WLS-ENO procedure, although the QR factorization with column pivoting is employed, the computational cost of solving WLS problem is still heavy. So in this paper, we will propose an improved WLS-ENO method for improving the efficiency. The basic idea of new method is that, let the reconstructed polynomial approximate the cell averages of some smooth cells in conservation fashion, and approximate other cell averages in WLS fashion, so that the resulted WLS problem only has one unknown. Because the resulted WLS problem can be solved by using the normal equation directly, the whole computational cost is small, thus the new method has better efficiency. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

AB In this paper a coupled phase field framework will be proposed for simulating the incompressible two-phase flows. For tracking the interface between two different phases, the improved conservative phase field equation is proposed, while the non-linear preconditioning phase field equation is utilized for alleviating the issue of erroneous estimation of normal vector. The proposed method is then incorporated with the improved divergence-free condition compensated coupled framework for solving two phase flows. With the present quasi multi moment framework, not only can the pressure and velocity be fully coupled, the balanced-forced surface tension model can also be employed without any issue. In order to show the applicability and accuracy, benchmark problems will first be investigated by the present framework, before a more comprehensive comparison with other experimental results and numerical predictions.

AB In this study, an alternative axisymmetric lattice Boltzmann flux solver (LBFS) is proposed within the framework of the kinetic theory-based axisymmetric lattice Boltzmann (LB) model. The macroscopic equations recovered from the axisymmetric LB model are globally resolved by the finite volume method, while numerical fluxes on the cell interface are locally reconstructed from solutions to the axisymmetric LB equation with the second-order of accuracy. Unlike the previous fractional step - axisymmetric LBFS which is based on the standard LB model and contains complicated source terms of various space derivatives, the present scheme originates from the kinetic theory-based lattice Boltzmann equation defined on the cylindrical coordinates which naturally incorporates the axisymmetric effects into the distribution functions and greatly simplifies the source terms involved. As a result, no space derivatives emerge in the source terms, and the corrector step in the previous LBFS model is removed, which yields more compact formulations. Moreover, previous inconsistency between the local reconstruction and the global governing equations is fixed in the present solver, which helps to nurture the computational results. By consolidating the evolutions of the azimuthal velocity and the temperature into the present axisymmetric LBFS, it is particularly suitable for simulations of isothermal and thermal swirling flows. The accuracy and robustness of the proposed scheme are validated through various benchmark tests. Comprehensive comparisons with the results from the previous solver demonstrate that the present solver is quantitatively more accurate than the previous solver, particularly in predicting the pressure distributions.

AB The entropy conservative/stable staggered grid tensor-product algorithm of Parsani et al. [1] is extended to multidimensional SBP discretizations. The required SBP preserving interpolation operators are proven to exist under mild restrictions and the resulting algorithm is proven to be entropy conservative/stable as well as elementwise conservative. For 2-dimensional simplex elements, the staggered grid algorithm is shown to be more accurate and have a larger maximum time step restriction as compared to the collocated algorithm. The staggered algorithm significantly reduces the number of (computationally expensive) two-point flux evaluations, which is potentially important for both explicit and implicit time-marching schemes. Furthermore, the staggered algorithm requires fewer degrees of freedom for comparable accuracy, which has favorable implications for implicit time-marching schemes. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

AB A new diffusion scheme satisfying the maximum principle on two-dimensional (2D) polygonal meshes is proposed. Being different from the existing schemes which are based on the nonlinear combination of the two one-side fluxes, the scheme in this paper is constructed by a modification of the conventional linear Two-Point Flux Approximation (TPFA) scheme, in which the two-side flux is constructed. To improve its accuracy on 2D skewed meshes, the TPFA scheme is rewritten by adding a tangential part, i.e., the tangential component of the flux multiplied with a nonlinear factor. A new method for the discretization of the tangential part is presented so that both the conservation condition and the maximum principle are satisfied, while the TPFA part remains unchanged. Moreover, by virtue of the harmonic averaging points for the calculation of the tangential part, the scheme has a minimal stencil, similar to the TPFA scheme. Finally, some numerical examples are presented to verify that it is second order accurate on 2D polygonal meshes for anisotropic diffusion problems. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB In this paper we propose a fluctuation splitting finite volume scheme for a nonconservative modeling of shear shallow water flow (SSWF). This model was originally proposed by Teshukov (2007) in [14] and was extended to include modeling of friction by Gavrilyuk et al. (2018) in [7]. The directional splitting scheme proposed by Gavrilyuk et al. (2018) in [7] is tricky to apply on unstructured grids. Our scheme is based on the physical splitting in which we separate the characteristic waves of the model to form two different hyperbolic sub-systems. The fluctuations associated with each sub-systems are computed by developing Riemann solvers for these sub-systems in a local coordinate system. These fluctuations enable us to develop a Godunov-type scheme that can be easily applied on mixed/unstructured grids. While the equation of energy conservation is solved along with the SSWF model in [7], in this paper we solve only SSWF model equations.
   We develop a cell-centered finite volume code to validate the proposed scheme with the help of some numerical tests. As expected, the scheme shows first order convergence. The numerical simulation of 1D roll waves shows a good agreement with the experimental results. The numerical simulations of 2D roll waves show similar transverse wave structures as observed in [7].

AB A novel lattice Boltzmann (LB) model with adjustable equation of state (EOS) is developed in this work for simulating coupled thermo-hydrodynamic flows. The velocity field is solved by the recently developed multiple-relaxation-time (MRT) LB equation for density distribution function (DF), by which an adjustable EOS can be recovered. As to the temperature field, a novel MRT LB equation for total energy DF is directly developed at the discrete level. By introducing a density-DF-related term into this LB equation and devising the equilibrium moment function for total energy DF, the viscous dissipation and compression work are consistently considered, and by modifying the collision matrix, the targeted energy conservation equation is recovered without deviation term. The full coupling of thermo-hydrodynamic effects is achieved via the adjustable EOS and the viscous dissipation and compression work. The present LB model is developed on the basis of the standard lattice, and various EOSs can be adopted in real applications. Moreover, both the Prandtl number and specific heat ratio can be arbitrarily adjusted. Furthermore, boundary condition treatment is also proposed on the basis of the judicious decomposition of DF into its equilibrium, force (source), and nonequilibrium parts. The local conservation of mass, momentum, and energy can be strictly satisfied at the boundary node. Numerical simulations of thermal Poiseuille and Couette flows are carried out with three different EOSs, and the numerical results are in good agreement with the analytical solutions. Then, natural convection in a square cavity with a large temperature difference is simulated for the Rayleigh number from 10(3) up to 10(8) . Good agreement between the present and previous numerical results is observed, which further validates the present LB model for coupled thermo-hydrodynamic flows. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

ID UNCERTAINTY
AB At the heart of structural engineering research is the use of data obtained from physical structures such as bridges, viaducts and buildings. These data can represent how the structure responds to various stimuli over time when in operation. Many models have been proposed in literature to represent such data, such as linear statistical models. Based upon these models, the health of the structure is reasoned about, e.g. through damage indices, changes in likelihood and statistical parameter estimates. On the other hand, physics-based models are typically used when designing structures to predict how the structure will respond to operational stimuli. These models represent how the structure responds to stimuli under idealised conditions. What remains unclear in the literature is how to combine the observed data with information from the idealised physics-based model into a model that describes the responses of the operational structure. This paper introduces a new approach which fuses together observed data from a physical structure during operation and information from a mathematical model. The observed data are combined with data simulated from the physics-based model using a multi-output Gaussian process formulation. The novelty of this method is how the information from observed data and the physics-based model is balanced to obtain a representative model of the structures response to stimuli. We present our method using data obtained from a fibre-optic sensor network installed on experimental railway sleepers. The curvature of the sleeper at sensor and also non-sensor locations is modelled, guided by the mathematical representation. We discuss how this approach can be used to reason about changes in the structures behaviour over time using simulations and experimental data. The results show that the methodology can accurately detect such changes. They also indicate that the methodology can infer information about changes in the parameters within the physics-based model, including those governing components of the structure not measured directly by sensors such as the ballast foundation.

AB We present a novel hybrid methodology combining the reference map theory with the level-set method for tracking moving interfaces. Instead of directly advecting the level-set function, we track the reference map, which maps the deformed state into the original one. We then reconstruct the deformed level-set function from this mapping and the original geometry. Because of the better smoothness of the reference map and the reduced impact of the reinitialization, this new approach grants higher precision. This results in significant improvements regarding interface location precision and mass conservation, especially in situations involving small deformations. Moreover, the implementation of the method is straightforward since it is based on the same numerical techniques used for the level-set method. Our coupled method is extensively validated in the case of externally generated velocity fields and incorporated into our previously introduced two-phase incompressible Navier-Stokes flow solver.

AB We propose a modified threshold dynamics method for wetting dynamics, which significantly improves the behavior near the contact line compared to the previous method (J. Comput. Phys. 330 (2017) 510-528). The new method is also based on minimizing the functional consisting of weighted interface areas over an extended domain including the solid phase. However, each interface area is approximated by the Lyapunov functional with a different Gaussian kernel. We show that a correct contact angle (Young's angle) is obtained in the leading order by choosing correct Gaussian kernel variances. We also show the Gamma convergence of the functional to the total surface energy. The method is simple, unconditionally stable with O (NlogN) computational complexity per time step and is not sensitive to the inhomogeneity or roughness of the solid surface. It is also shown that the dynamics of the contact point is consistent with the dynamics of the interface away from the contact point. Numerical examples have shown significant improvements in the accuracy of the contact angle and the hysteresis behavior of the contact angle. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The present paper develops two new techniques, namely additive correction multicloud (ACMC) and smoothed restriction multicloud (SRMC), for the efficient solution of systems of equations arising from Radial Basis Function-generated Finite Difference (RBF-FD) meshless discretizations of partial differential equations (PDEs). RBF-FD meshless methods employ arbitrary distributed nodes, without the need to generate a mesh, for the numerical solution of PDEs. The proposed techniques are specifically designed for the RBF-FD data structure and employ simple restriction and interpolation strategies in order to obtain a hierarchy of coarse-level node distributions and the corresponding correction equations.
   Both techniques are kept as simple as possible in terms of code implementation, which is an important feature of meshless methods. The techniques are verified on 2D and 3D Poisson equations, defined on non-trivial domains , showing very high benefits in terms of both time consumption and work to convergence when comparing the present techniques to the most common solver approaches. These benefits make the RBF-FD approach competitive with standard grid-based approaches when the number of nodes is very high, allowing large size problems to be tackled by the RBF-FD method.

AB Recent researches on migration focus on computational efficiency and imaging accuracy. Modeling is at the heart of the reverse time migration (RTM), a powerful tool for imaging geologically complex structures, and controls its efficiency and accuracy. Finite-difference (FD) method is widely used in modeling. Though the rhombus stencil FD scheme has high accuracy, it is expensive and only applicable to square grids. In order to make the high-accuracy FD scheme more efficient and flexible, we develop a rectangle-grid cross and rhombus stencils FD scheme (RCR). To further improve accuracy, the optimal FD method based on least squares (LS) is introduced into the RCR. Correspondingly, the absorbing boundary condition (ABC) should be extended to rectangular grids for suppressing the boundary reflections of modeling, we therefore develop the rectangular-grid hybrid ABC. To obtain high-efficiency and high-accuracy RTM images, the adaptive variable-length spatial operators scheme is combined with the LS-based RCR when implementing the wavefield extrapolation, and the efficient boundary condition is adopted when performed on GPU card. By comparing the RCR with the rectangular-grid on cross stencil FD scheme (RC) in terms of their phase dispersion, stability and snapshot, we demonstrate the superiority of the LS-based RCR. We have also proven the effectiveness of the rectangular-grid hybrid ABC on absorption, and shown that under the similar accuracy, the RCR-based RTM can achieve higher efficiency than the RC-based one by adopting a larger time interval. Finally, the RCR-based RTM obtains a well-imaged profile for field data. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB We revisit and investigate the application of an infinite mapping layer in the context of different physical fields. This layer remaps the infinite physical domain to a finite extension covering the boundary of the computational domain. Thus, infinite domain problems are solved efficiently by this advanced finite element method. Compared to infinite elements, this method has major practical advantages since it uses standard basis functions. However, the solution at the outer boundary of the infinite layer must be bounded. In principle, this method can be applied to arbitrarily shaped mapping layers.
   The presented method is verified against three physical field problems and their analytic solution. Firstly, the computation of the electrostatic potential in an unbounded region is investigated. Secondly, a benchmark problem of mechanical engineering demonstrates the method for continuum mechanics. Finally, eigenmodes of deep water waves are solved accurately. For these three cases, we assess three different mapping functions of tangent, exponential, and rational type and comment on their suitability for different physical field problems. The method guarantees high efficiency and accuracy, as shown by the application examples. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB This paper develops the unsteady continuous adjoint method for aeroacoustic optimization problems governed by time-dependent turbulent flows. To predict the flow-induced sound radiation from a body in free-stream, an incompressible Improved Delayed Detached Eddy Simulation is firstly performed. The generated noise is then propagated with the Kirchhoff Integral method, which uses the pressure distribution on the body surface to compute the sound pressure at selected receivers. The continuous adjoint method for the aforementioned process is developed and presented for the first time. The differentiated Kirchhoff Integral is used to compute the boundary condition of the adjoint velocity on the body surface and, then, the unsteady adjoint equations are solved backwards in time. The time window during which the simulation is performed and the one during which the objective function is evaluated do not coincide. This is reflected on the adjoint boundary conditions along the body and the time integration of the sensitivity derivatives. To ensure the consistency of the continuous adjoint-based gradients, grid sensitivities are taken into account. By incorporating the grid displacement equations during the mathematical development of the adjoint method, the surface integral of the residuals of the flow PDEs, which is commonly omitted, is replaced with a volume integral of the grid sensitivities and gives rise to the adjoint grid displacement equations along with an accurate sensitivity derivatives expression. The proposed method is verified against finite differences in a 3D turbulent flow around a cylinder and, then, applied to a real-world test case, concerned with the flow-induced sound radiation of the side mirror of the generic SAE vehicle.

AB This paper develops a multifidelity method that enables estimation of failure probabilities for expensive-to-evaluate models via information fusion and importance sampling. The presented general fusion method combines multiple probability estimators with the goal of variance reduction. We use low-fidelity models to derive biasing densities for importance sampling and then fuse the importance sampling estimators such that the fused multifidelity estimator is unbiased and has mean-squared error lower than or equal to that of any of the importance sampling estimators alone. By fusing all available estimators, the method circumvents the challenging problem of selecting the best biasing density and using only that density for sampling. A rigorous analysis shows that the fused estimator is optimal in the sense that it has minimal variance amongst all possible combinations of the estimators. The asymptotic behavior of the proposed method is demonstrated on a convection-diffusion-reaction partial differential equation model for which 10(5) samples can be afforded. To illustrate the proposed method at scale, we consider a model of a free plane jet and quantify how uncertainties at the flow inlet propagate to a quantity of interest related to turbulent mixing. Compared to an importance sampling estimator that uses the high-fidelity model alone, our multifidelity estimator reduces the required CPU time by 65% while achieving a similar coefficient of variation.

AB A novel dual-scale compact method for solving nonparaxial Helmholtz equations at high wavenumbers is proposed and analyzed. The approach is based on decomposing the axisymmetric transverse domain and governing equation according to interconnected micro and macro regions to maintain the smoothness of the underlying problem. Dual compact strategies are then implemented for acquiring highly accurate and efficient beam propagation computations. Aiming at the highly oscillatory solution features, the paper provides a rigorous analysis on the numerical stability. It is shown that the dual-scaled compact method is asymptotically stable. The analysis also reveals necessary constraints for the conventional stability. Computer experiments including self-focusing beam propagation simulations are conducted with various domain scaling factors to validate the theoretical results. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

AB Large scale dynamical systems (e.g. many nonlinear coupled differential equations) can often be summarized in terms of only a few state variables (a few equations), a trait that reduces complexity and facilitates exploration of behavioral aspects of otherwise intractable models. High model dimensionality and complexity makes symbolic, pen-and-paper model reduction tedious and impractical, a difficulty addressed by recently developed frameworks that computerize reduction. Symbolic work has the benefit, however, of identifying both reduced state variables and parameter combinations that matter most (effective parameters, "inputs"); whereas current computational reduction schemes leave the parameter reduction aspect mostly unaddressed. As the interest in mapping out and optimizing complex input-output relations keeps growing, it becomes clear that combating the curse of dimensionality also requires efficient schemes for input space exploration and reduction. Here, we explore systematic, data-driven parameter reduction by means of effective parameter identification, starting from current nonlinear manifold-learning techniques enabling state space reduction. Our approach aspires to extend the data-driven determination of effective state variables with the data-driven discovery of effective model parameters, and thus to accelerate the exploration of high-dimensional parameter spaces associated with complex models.

DE Particle tracking; Larmor radius; Magnetic fields; Ultra high energy
   cosmic rays
AB We analyzed the performance of several numerical integration methods in the ultra-relativistic regime. The integration methods include the fourth order Runge-Kutta, Boris, Vay, and a new method (called New Euler). For a proton traveling in a circular trajectory through a uniform perpendicular magnetic field, we have calculated the relative percentage error of Larmor radius of the particle's trajectory, relative efficiency between the methods, and relative percentage error of the particle's energy as a function of CPU time. In these calculations, we have investigated the influence of the following parameters: particle's energy, magnetic field strength, and the integration step. On calculating the Larmor radius, the four methods examined have all presented great precision. Among all studied cases, the most efficient method was the Boris method, which completes within a given CPU time more than twice cycles (complete circles, or periods of revolution) given by the Runge-Kutta one. The least efficient was the New Euler method (0.08 cycles), followed by Vay one (0.21 cycles). On the calculation of the particle's energy, New Euler method has exhibited the best properties, with the maximum relative percentage error of the particle's energy of roughly 10(-13)% remaining constant during the entire simulation. Except in the cases with the biggest simulation step, when for the Runge-Kutta method the particle's energy diverges asymptotically from its initial value, and with the smallest simulation step and lowest energy, when the Boris method has presented less precision than the Runge-Kutta one. The Runge-Kutta and Boris methods have presented approximately the same precision, with the maximum relative percentage error of similar to 10(-11)%. The Vay method has presented the worst precision, with the particle's energy diverging asymptotically for all studied cases, with the relative percentage error of the particle's energy reaching approximately 10(-8)%, in ten seconds of CPU time.

AB The second-order backward-difference (BDF2) method requires solutions at two previous time steps and is often started with the first-order backward-difference (BDF1) method. The initial time step is typically taken to be small in order to minimize the effect of the first-order error. However, contrary to expectations, the solution computed in this way generates a very large error for stiff problems and the error grows as the initial time step is further reduced. As shown in this note, the problem is originated from the fact that the variable-coefficient BDF2 method combined with any first- or higher-order one-step method is asymptotically equivalent to the trapezoidal method and therefore not L-stable. Based on the study presented, it is strongly recommended that BDF2 method be started with a self-starting second-order implicit Runge-Kutta method, which guarantees second-order accuracy and L-stability at no additional cost.

AB In Hu et al. (2016) [22], it has been successfully demonstrated that using lower-order moment model correction is a promising idea to accelerate the steady-state computation of high-order moment models of the Boltzmann equation. To develop the existing solver, the following aspects are studied in this paper. First, the finite volume method with linear reconstruction is employed for high-resolution spatial discretization of the resulting equations. Second, by introducing an appropriate parameter tau in the correction step, it is found that the performance of the solver can be improved significantly, i.e., more levels would be involved in the solver, which further accelerates the convergence of the method. Third, Heun's method is employed as the smoother in each level to enhance the robustness of the solver. Numerical experiments in microflows are carried out to demonstrate the efficiency and to investigate the behavior of the new solver. In addition, several order reduction strategies for the choice of the order sequence of the solver are tested, and the strategy m(l-1) = [m(l)/2] is found to be most efficient. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

AB The Galerkin difference (GD) basis is a set of continuous, piecewise polynomials defined using a finite-difference-like grid of degrees of freedom. The one dimensional GD basis functions are naturally extended to multiple dimensions using a tensor product construction on quadrilateral elements. The GD basis can be used to define the solution space for a discontinuous Galerkin finite element discretization of partial differential equations. In this work we propose two approaches to handling complex geometries within this setting: (1) using nonconforming, curvilinear GD elements and (2) coupling affine GD elements with curvilinear simplicial elements. In both cases the (semidiscrete) discontinuous Galerkin method is provably energy stable even when variational crimes are committed. Additionally, for both element types a weight-adjusted mass matrix is used, which ensures that only the reference mass matrix must be inverted. We also present sufficient conditions on the treatment of metric terms for the curvilinear, nonconforming GD elements to ensure that the scheme is both constant preserving and conservative. Numerical experiments confirm the stability results and demonstrate the accuracy of the coupled schemes. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB Stochastic problems governed by nonlinear conservation laws are challenging due to solution discontinuities in stochastic and physical space. In this paper, we present a level set method to track discontinuities in stochastic space by solving a Hamilton-Jacobi equation. By introducing a speed function that vanishes at discontinuities, the iso-zeros of the level set problem coincide with the discontinuities of the conservation law. The level set problem is solved on a sequence of successively finer grids in stochastic space. The method is adaptive in the sense that costly evaluations of the conservation law of interest are only performed in the vicinity of the discontinuities during the refinement stage. In regions of stochastic space where the solution is smooth, a surrogate method replaces expensive evaluations of the conservation law. The proposed method is tested in conjunction with different sets of localized orthogonal basis functions on simplex elements, as well as frames based on piecewise polynomials conforming to the level set function. The performance of the proposed method is compared to existing adaptive multi-element generalized polynomial chaos methods. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB We study the error scaling properties of large-eddy simulation (LES) in the outer region of wall-bounded turbulence at moderately high Reynolds numbers. In order to avoid the additional complexity of wall-modeling, we perform LES of turbulent channel flows in which the no-slip condition at the wall is replaced by a Neumann condition supplying the exact mean wall-stress. The statistics investigated are the mean velocity profile, turbulence intensities, and kinetic energy spectra. The errors follow (Delta/L)(alpha) Re-tau(gamma), where Delta is the characteristic grid resolution, Re-tau is the friction Reynolds number, and L is the meaningful length-scale to normalize Delta in order to collapse the errors across the wall-normal distance. We show that Delta can be expressed as the L-2-norm of the grid vector and that L is well represented by the ratio of the friction velocity and mean shear. The exponent alpha is estimated from theoretical arguments for each statistical quantity of interest and shown to roughly match the values computed by numerical simulations. For the mean profile and kinetic energy spectra, alpha approximate to 1, whereas the turbulence intensities converge at a slower rate alpha < 1. The exponent gamma is approximately 0, i.e. the LES solution is independent of the Reynolds number. The expected behavior of the turbulence intensities at high Reynolds numbers is also derived and shown to agree with the classic log-layer profiles for grid resolutions lying within the inertial range. Further examination of the LES turbulence intensities and spectra reveals that both quantities resemble their filtered counterparts from direct numerical simulation (DNS) data, but that the mechanism responsible for this similarity is related to the balance between the input power and dissipation rather than to filtering.

The waveguide terminates at one end and has unknown geometry due to compactly supported wall deformations. The goal of imaging is to determine these deformations and to identify localized scatterers in the waveguide, using a remote array of sensors that emits time harmonic probing waves and records the echoes. We present a theoretical analysis of the imaging approach and illustrate its performance with numerical simulations. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB We present an image-guided computational approach for inversely determining in vivo material properties of fish fins and simulating flow-structure interactions (FSI) of fin deformations based on a highly realistic hybrid membrane-beam structure. This approach is established by coupling an imaged-based reconstruction, a genetic-algorithm (GA)-based optimization, a finite-element-method (FEM)-based computational structural dynamics model and an immersed-boundary-method (IBM)-based computational fluid dynamics (CFD) solver. An inverse-problem procedure is developed to determine material properties from prescribed kinematic motions obtained from high-speed images. The procedure is validated through two tests including a flexible pitching plate and a shell-beam structured flexible plate in heaving motion. The FSI model (forward problem) is validated through two benchmark tests including flow-induced vibration of a flexible beam attached to a fixed cylinder and a flexible pitching plate in a uniform flow. This integrated method is then applied to the FSI analysis of propulsion of a rainbow trout caudal fin with a specific focus on the fin material properties, fin deformations, hydrodynamic performances and flow structures. We demonstrate that, by using reconstructed kinematics and deformation obtained from the high-speed videos, the non-uniform material properties of the fin can be determined through the inverse problem procedure. A fully-coupled FSI simulation is then carried out based on the outcome of the inverse problem. The results have shown the feasibility of the present integrated approach in accurately modeling and quantitatively evaluating flexible-fin kinematics and hydrodynamics in swimming in terms of both chordwise and spanwise deformations, thrust and lateral forces, and vortex dynamics.

AB In this paper, new high order schemes are constructed and analyzed, for the numerical solution of Euler equations of isentropic gas dynamics. Material waves are treated explicitly, while acoustic waves are treated implicitly, thus avoiding severe CFL restrictions for low Mach flows. High order accuracy in space is obtained by finite difference WENO schemes; while high order in time is obtained by IMEX methods with semi-implicit linearization treatment. The schemes are proven to be asymptotic preserving and asymptotic accurate as the Mach number vanishes. Several tests in one and two space dimensions illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed schemes. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB A class of modular high order forward semi-Lagrangian (FSL) schemes with a number of advantages (outlined below) for linear advection equations is extended to have high resolution, in the sense that sharp gradients can be captured without loss of accuracy, by means of weighted essentially non-oscillatory derivative (DWENO) calculations based on finite differences. Principally, our approach (the convected scheme, CS) differs from conventional high order FSL schemes in the means by which it reaches higher order accuracy. The high order CS progressed in this work reserves use of a low order histogram representation of the solution and a mass-conservative volume-weighted projection operator which ordinarily produces a second order accurate solution. A higher order version is obtained by compensating for the amount by which the CS solution and the exact solution disagree at every order in a Taylor series sense. Instead of including these error terms algebraically, which changes the projection operator itself, the novel idea of the CS is to incorporate this information geometrically as a commensurate adjustment to the volume-weighted proportion assigned to each cell. We leverage DWENO approximations to compute these Taylor series error terms more sensitively, and show the corresponding WENO convected schemes (WENO-CS) achieve the desired dual high order and high resolution behavior. Fifth, seventh, and ninth order WENO-CS base solvers are presented for the 1D constant speed advection equation prototype, and are employed in a Strang splitting approach for the numerical solution of linear and nonlinear two-dimensional hyperbolic equations. Results are showcased for 2D linear transport and rigid body rotation, as well as for classic benchmark problems for the (1 + 1)-dimensional Vlasov-Poisson system including Landau damping, and the two-stream instability. The schemes enjoy the usual benefits of semi-Lagrangian schemes (e.g. no CFL time step restriction) while further claiming distinct advantages afforded to forward schemes including automatic mass conservation, compact support, and therefore straightforward parallelization.

AB A set of non-convex calculation tools for volume of fluid (VOF) methods in general grids is presented. The complexity of the volume truncation operation and the computation of the interface position to cut off a certain liquid volume fraction from a cell, involved in VOF methods, is greatly increased when non-convex grids and polytopes are considered. Therefore, the tools for convex geometries developed in a previous work by Lopez and Hernandez (2008) [32] have required profound adaptation for the different algorithms not only to address the challenges of the new geometry, but also to maintain the efficiency and robustness of previous tools. Also, a new method for the liquid volume initialization in general polygonal and polyhedral cells, either convex or non-convex, is proposed. A comparison with conventional procedures based on convex decomposition is carried out using different tests, whereby it is demonstrated that the proposed tools represent a substantial improvement in computational efficiency. Overall, a speedup of around one order of magnitude is achieved for the reconstruction of several 2D and 3D interfacial shapes. (C) 2019 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB Direct three-dimensional (3D) numerical simulations of acoustic fields in range-dependent shallow water environments remains a challenge due to environmental complexities and large computational cost. We develop an efficient 3D boundary element method (BEM) to solve the Helmholtz equation for shallow water acoustic propagation, which utilizes a Pre-corrected Fast Fourier Transform (PFFT) approach to reduce the computational effort from 0 (N-2 similar to 3) to 0 (N log N) where N is the total number of boundary unknowns. To account for inhomogeneous media, the method allows for arbitrary number of coupled multi-layer BEM sub-domains. With 0 (N log N) efficiency and the use of massively parallel high-performance computing platforms, we are able to conduct multi-layer 3D direct numerical simulations of low-mid frequency acoustics over kilometer ranges. We perform extensive validations of the method and provide two shallow water waveguide examples benchmarked against theoretical solutions. To illustrate the efficacy and usefulness of the PFFT-BEM method, we perform 3D large-scale direct numerical simulations to assess the performance of two established canonical models: axisymmetric coupled mode model for 3D seamount; and Kirchhoff approximation and perturbation theory for 3D rough surface scattering.

AB In this study, we establish a full coupling model (FCM) to simulate strong bubble-sphere interactions based on a three-dimensional boundary integral method. Different from the conventional loose coupling model (LCM), FCM adopts several auxiliary functions to deal with the mutual dependence between the hydrodynamic force and the sphere acceleration. In addition, the weighted moving least square method, a mesh density control scheme and an adaptive mesh refinement scheme are implemented to improve the quality of mesh on the deformable bubble surface. To validate the present model, convergence tests on different mesh sizes and time steps are conducted at first. The numerical results are also compared with the axisymmetric model, in which consistent results have been achieved. We further make comparisons between the numerical results and those from several experiments under different boundary conditions. For weak interaction cases, both LCM and FCM can give the results that have good agreement with the experiment data. As the interaction effects become stronger, the advantage of the FCM over the LCM becomes increasingly obvious. Particularly, when the pulsating bubble is in contact with the sphere surface, the essential physical features of the experiments can be well reproduced by the FCM while the predictions by the LCM are significantly different from the experiment. The present 3D model can be further extended to study more complex underwater contact explosions, cavitation inception on a structure and airgun bubble dynamics. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

AB An appropriate calibration and forecasting of volatility and market risk are some of the main challenges faced by companies that have to manage the uncertainty inherent to their investments or funding operations such as banks, pension funds or insurance companies. This has become even more evident after the 2007-2008 Financial Crisis, when the forecasting models assessing the market risk and volatility failed. Since then, a significant number of theoretical developments and methodologies have appeared to improve the accuracy of the volatility forecasts and market risk assessments. Following this line of thinking, this paper introduces a model based on using a set of Machine Learning techniques, such as Gradient Descent Boosting, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine and Artificial Neural Network, where those algorithms are stacked to predict S&P500 volatility. The results suggest that our construction outperforms other habitual models on the ability to forecast the level of volatility, leading to a more accurate assessment of the market risk.

AB Classical time series analysis methods are not readily applicable to the series with missing observations. To deal with the missingness in time series, the common approach is to use imputation techniques to fill in the gaps and get a regularly spaced series. However, this approach has several drawbacks such as information and time bias, relationship causality, and not being suitable for the series with a high missingness rate. Instead of directly imputing the missing values, we propose a bagging algorithm to improve on the accuracy of imputation methods utilizing block bootstrap methods and marked point processes. We consider non-overlapping, moving, and circular block bootstrap methods along with amplitude modulated series and integer valued sequences. Imputation methods considered for bagging are Stineman and linear interpolations, Kalman filters, and weighted moving average. Imputation accuracy of the proposed algorithm is investigated by nearly 3000 yearly, quarterly, and monthly time series from different sectors under the "missing completely random" and "missing at random" missingness mechanisms. The results of the numerical study show that the proposed algorithm improved the accuracy of the considered imputation methods at most of the instances for different missingness rates and frequencies under both missingness mechanisms.

AB This paper considers the problem of policy optimization in the context of continuous-time Reinforcement Learning (RL), a branch of artificial intelligence, for financial portfolio management purposes. The underlying asset portfolio process is assumed to possess a continuous-time discrete-state Markov chain structure involving the simplex and ergodicity constraints. The goal of the portfolio problem is the redistribution of a fund into different financial assets. One general assumption has to be set, namely that the market is arbitrage-free (no price arbitrage is possible) then the problem of how to obtain the optimal policy is solvable. We provide a RL solution based on an actor/critic architecture in which the market is characterized by a restriction called transaction cost, involving time penalization. The portfolio problem in Markov chains is determined by solving a convex quadratic minimization problem with linear constraints. Any Markov chain is generated by a stochastic transition matrices and the mathematical expectations of the rewards. In particular, we estimate the elements of the transition rate matrices and the mathematical expectations of the rewards. This method learns the optimal strategy in order to make a decision on what portfolio weight to take for a single period. With this strategy, the agent is able to choose the state with maximum utility and select its respective action. The optimal policy computation is solved employing a proximal optimization novel approach, which involves time penalization in the transaction costs and the rewards. We employ the Lagrange multipliers approach to include the restrictions of the market and those that are imposed by the continuous time frame. Moreover, a specific numerical example in baking, that fit into the general framework of portfolio, validates the effectiveness and usefulness of the proposed method. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

AB We investigate some legal interpretation techniques from the viewpoint of the Argentinian jurisprudence. This allows the proposal of a logical framework-from a computer science perspective- for modeling such specific reasoning techniques towards an appropriate construction of legal arguments. Afterwards, we study the usage of assumptions towards construction of hypotheses. This is proposed in the dynamic context of legal procedures, where the referred argumentation framework evolves as part of the investigation instance prior to the trial. We propose belief revision operators to handle such dynamics, preserving a coherent behavior with regards to the legal interpretation used. Abduction is finally proposed to construct systematic hypothesization, with the objective to bring semi-automatic recommendations to push forward the investigation of a legal case.

AB Artificial intelligence (Al) has transformed the world and the relationships among humans as the learning capabilities of machines have allowed for a new means of communication between humans and machines. In the field of health, there is much interest in new technologies that help to improve and automate services in hospitals. This article aims to explore the literature related to conversational agents applied to health care, searching for definitions, patterns, methods, architectures, and data types. Furthermore, this work identifies an agent application taxonomy, current challenges, and research gaps. In this work, we use a systematic literature review approach.
   We guide and refine this study and the research questions by applying Population, Intervention, Comparison, Outcome, and Context (PICOC) criteria. The present study investigated approximately 4145 articles involving conversational agents in health published over the last ten years. In this context, we finally selected 40 articles based on their approaches and objectives as related to our main subject. As a result, we developed a taxonomy, identified the main challenges in the field, and defined the main types of dialog and contexts related to conversational agents in health. These results contributed to discussions regarding conversational health agents, and highlighted some research gaps for future study. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID IDENTIFICATION; SYSTEMS
AB In this work, a multi-agent distributed model predictive control (DMPC) including fuzzy negotiation has been developed. A novel fuzzy inference system is introduced as a negotiation technique between agents in a cooperative game algorithm, allowing for the consideration of economic criteria and process constraints within the negotiation process, providing an easier interpretation of the available knowledge. The fuzzy negotiation produces smoother control actions than where the negotiation is based only on costs evaluation, because both agents provide their best to generate the final control action. The results show good tracking and disturbance rejection in the case study proposed. The methodology has been implemented in a JAVA based platform with a friendly user interface to deploy the multi-agent system (MAS), and it has been validated in the water level control in a four coupled tanks system.

AB Decision trees are efficient means for building classification models due to the compressibility, simplicity and ease of interpretation of their results. However, during the construction phase of decision trees, the outputs are often large trees that are affected by many uncertainties in the data (particularity, noise and residual variation). Combining attribute selection and data sampling presents one of the most promising research directions to overcome decision tree construction problems. However, the search space composed of all possible combinations of subsets of training samples and attributes is extremely large. In this paper, a novel approach is presented that allows generating an optimized decision tree by selecting an optimal couple of training samples and attributes subsets for training. As the search space of candidate couples of training samples and attributes subsets is extremely large, we use particle swarm optimization to make the search of an "optimal" solution tractable. The selected optimized solution helps in avoiding over-fitting and complexity problems suffered in the construction phase of decision trees. We conducted an extensive experimental evaluation on 22 datasets from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The obtained results show that the proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art classical as well as evolutionary decision tree construction methods in terms of simplicity, accuracy, and F-measure. We further evaluate our approach on a real-world engineering application for condition monitoring of rotating machinery under severe non-stationary conditions. The obtained results showed that the proposed approach allowed to optimize the use of instantaneous angular speed to diagnose gears defects. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The task of designing a recommender system is a complex process. Because of the many technological advancements that may be included in a recommender system, engineers are faced with a fast growing number of design related decisions to be taken. Unfortunately, there is no general approach yet for decision makers that can act as a framework guiding the design of a recommender system. The rich collection of literature on recommender systems, though, offers a great source to identify the key areas where these decisions need to be taken. In this paper, we survey existing literature with the aim of building a recommender system model inspired by Osterwalder's canvas theory. The result of our semi-structured synthesis is a novel design approach in the form of a canvas for designing recommender systems. This work provides a better understanding and can serve as a guide for decision making in recommender system design. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The learning problem from imbalanced data set poses a major challenge in data mining community. Conventional machine learning algorithms show poor performance in dealing with the classification problems of imbalanced data set since they are originally designed to work with balanced class distribution. In this paper, we propose a new over-sampling technique, which uses the real-value negative selection (RNS) procedure to generate artificial minority data with no requirement of actual minority data available. The generated minority data with rare actual minority data if available are combined with the majority data as input to a bi-class classification approach for learning. In the experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of RNS in avoiding the problems often encountered by the existing over-sampling methods such as the generation of noisy instances and almost duplicated instances in the same clusters. Moreover, the extensive experimental results on the different imbalanced datasets from UCI repository and real-world imbalanced datasets show that when dealing with the classification of imbalanced datasets, the proposed hybrid approach can achieve better performance in terms of both G-Mean and F-Measure evaluation metrics as compared to the other existing imbalanced dataset classification techniques.

AB Moth-flame optimization algorithm (MFO) is a new nature-inspired meta-heuristic based on the navigation routine of moths in the environment known as transverse orientation. For some complex optimization tasks, especially high dimensional and multimodal problems, the conventional MFO may face problems in the convergence trends or be trapped into the local and deceptive optima. Therefore, in this study, two strategies have been introduced into the conventional MFO to get a more stable sense of balance between the exploration and exploitation propensities. First, Gaussian mutation is employed to increase the population diversity of MFO. Then, a chaotic local search is applied to the flame updating process of MFO for better exploiting the locality of the solutions. The proposed CLSGMFO approach was compared against a wide range of well-known classical metaheuristic algorithms (MAs) and various advanced MAs using 23 classical benchmark functions. It was shown that the designed CLSGMFO can outperform most of the popular MAs in terms of solution quality and convergence speed. Moreover, based on CLSGMFO, a hybrid kernel extreme learning machine model, which is called CLSGMFO-KELM, is established to deal with financial stress prediction scenarios. To investigate the effectiveness of the CLSGMFO-KELM model, the proposed hybrid system was tested on two widely used financial datasets and compared against a broad array of popular classifiers. The results demonstrate that the proposed learning scheme can offer a superior kernel extreme learning machine model with excellent predictive performance. Accordingly, the proposed CLSGMFO can serve as an effective and efficient computer-aided tool for financial prediction. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Facial image manipulation is a particular instance of digital image tampering, which is done by corn positing a region from one facial image into another facial image. Fake images generated by facial image manipulation now spread like wildfire on news websites and social networks, and are considered the greatest threat to press freedom. Previous research relied heavily on handcrafted features to analyze tampered regions which were inefficient and time-consuming. This paper introduces a framework that accurately detects manipulated face image using deep learning approach. The original contributions of this paper include (1) a customized convolutional neural network model for Manipulated Face (MANFA) identification; it contains several convolutional layers that effectively extract features of multi-levels of abstraction from a tampered region. (2) A hybrid framework (HF-MANFA) that uses Adaptive Boosting (AdaBoost) and eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) to deal with the imbalanced dataset challenge. (3) A large manipulated face dataset that is manually collected and validated. The results from various experiments proved that proposed models outperformed existing expert and intelligent systems which were usually used for the manipulated face image detection task in terms of area under the curve (AUC), computational complexity, and robustness against imbalanced datasets. As a result, the presented framework will motivate the finding of a more powerful altered face images detection method and encourages the integration of the proposed model in applications that have to deal with manipulated images regularly.

AB Similarity measure is an essential component of information retrieval, document clustering, text summarization, and question answering, among others. In this paper, we introduce a general framework of syntactic similarity measures for matching short text. We thoroughly analyze the measures by dividing them into three components: character-level similarity, string segmentation, and matching technique. Soft variants of the measures are also introduced. With the help of two existing toolkits (SecondString and SimMetric), we provide an open-source Java toolkit of the proposed framework, which integrates the individual components together so that completely new combinations can be created. Experimental results reveal that the performance of the similarity measures depends on the type of the dataset. For well-maintained dataset, using a token-level measure is important but the basic (crisp) variant is usually enough. For uncontrolled dataset where typing errors are expected, the soft variants of the token-level measures are necessary. Among all tested measures, a soft token-level measure that combines set matching and q-grams at the character level perform best. A gap between human perception and syntactic measures still remains due to lacking semantic analysis. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Complex Event Processing (CEP) is an established software technology to extract relevant information from massive data streams. Currently, domain experts have to determine manually CEP rules that define a situation of interest. However, often CEP rules cannot be formulated by experts, because the relevant interdependencies and relations between the data are not explicitly known, but inherently hidden in the data streams. To cope with this problem, we present a new learning approach for CEP rules, which is based on Genetic Programming. We discuss in detail the different building blocks of Genetic Programming and how to adjust them to CEP rule learning. Extensive evaluations with synthetic and real world data demonstrate the high potential of the approach and give some hints about the choice of suitable process parameters. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

AB In this paper, we propose SummCoder, a novel methodology for generic extractive text summarization of single documents. The approach generates a summary according to three sentence selection metrics formulated by us: sentence content relevance, sentence novelty, and sentence position relevance. The sentence content relevance is measured using a deep auto-encoder network, and the novelty metric is derived by exploiting the similarity among sentences represented as embeddings in a distributed semantic space. The sentence position relevance metric is a hand-designed feature, which assigns more weight to the first few sentences through a dynamic weight calculation function regulated by the document length. Furthermore, a sentence ranking and a selection technique are developed to generate the document summary by ranking the sentences according to the final score obtained through the fusion of the three sentences selection metrics. We also introduce a new summarization benchmark, Tor Illegal Documents Summarization (TIDSumm) dataset, especially to assist Law Enforcement Agencies (LEAs), that contains two sets of ground truth summaries, manually created, for 100 web documents extracted from onion websites in Tor (The Onion Router) network. Empirical results show that, on DUC 2002, on Blog Summarization, and on TIDSumm datasets, our text summarization approach obtains comparable or better performance than the state-of-the-art methods for different ROUGE metrics.

AB Fire outbreaks are a serious risk in campsites due to the surroundings and dynamic environment of these areas. Due to climate change, conditions of high ignition propensity are becoming more frequent, leading to an increased need for the development of alternative fire prevention systems that can mitigate the consequences of fire incidents. In this context, this work explores thermal imaging data for early detection of fire outbreaks, aiming for application in a real context. To that end, experimental trials were conducted in laboratory and at the venue of a summer festival under real operation conditions. The datasets acquired are characterized in detail, and a feature engineering process is devised for the analysis of the response of thermal imaging sensors to a fire ignition. To deal with high-dimensional data, the feature construction method follows a statistical color-based approach, that characterizes the dynamic changes in the data using three features. Subsequently, this paper proposes a fuzzy modeling approach based on these variables, which is transparent to interpretation and enables the assessment of patterns modeled. The performance of the classification algorithm for detection of fire outbreaks is evaluated and framed with works in the state-of-the-art for this application. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

ID CLASSIFIERS
AB Predictive analytics is an essential capability in business process management to forecast future status and performance of business processes. In this paper, we focus on one particular predictive monitoring task that is solved using classification techniques, i.e. predicting the next event in a case. Several different classifiers have been recently employed in the literature in this task. However, a quantitative benchmark of different classifiers is currently lacking. In this paper, we build such a benchmark by taking into account 20 classifiers from five families, i.e. trees, Bayesian, rule-based, neural and meta classifiers. We employ six real-world process event logs and consider two different sampling approaches, i.e. case and event-based sampling, and three different validation methods in order to acquire a comprehensive evaluation about the classifiers' performance. According to our benchmark, the classifier most likely to be the overall superior performer is the credal decision tree (C-DT), followed by the other top-4 performers, i.e. random forest, decision tree, dagging ensemble, and nested dichotomies ensemble. We also provide a qualitative discussion of how features of an event log can affect the choice of best classifier. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This paper proposes a novel approach based on adaptive dimensionality reduction (ADR) and a semi supervised 3-D convolutional neural network (3-D CNN) for the spectro-spatial classification of hyper spectral images (HSIs). It tackles the problem of curse of dimensionality and the limited number of training samples by selecting the most relevant spectral bands. The selected bands should be informative, discriminative and distinctive. They are fed into a semi-supervised 3-D CNN feature extractor, then a linear regression classifier to produce the classification map. In fact, the proposed semi-supervised 3-D CNN model seeks to extract the deep spectral and spatial features based on convolutional encoder-decoder to enhance the HSI classification. It uses several 3-D convolution and max-pooling layers to extract these features from the selected relevant bands. The main advantage of the proposed approach is to reduce the high dimensionality of HSI, preserve the relevant spectro-spatial information and enhance the classification using few labeled training samples. Experimental studies are carried out on three real HSI data sets: Indian Pines, Pavia University, and Salinas. The obtained results show that the proposed approach performs better than other deep learning-based methods including CNN-based methods, and significantly improves the classification accuracy of HSIs.

AB Classification of text based on its substance is an essential part of analysis to organize enormously large text data and to mine the salient information contained in it. It is gaining greater attention with the surge in the volume of on-line data available. Classical algorithms like k-NN (k-nearest neighbor), SVM (Support Vector Machine) and their variations have been observed to yield only reasonable results in addressing the problem, leaving enough room for further improvement. A class of algorithms commonly referred to as Sparse Methods has been emerged recently from compressive sensing and found numerous effective applications in many areas of data analysis and image processing. Sparse Methods as a tool for text analysis is an alley that is largely unexplored rigorously. This paper presents exploration of sparse representation-based methods for text classification. Based on the success of sparse representation based methods in different areas of data analysis, we intuitively hypothesized that it should work well on text classification problems as well. This paper empirically reinforces the hypothesis by testing the method on Reuters and WebKB data sets. The empirical results on Reuters and WebKB benchmark data show that it can outperform classical classification algorithms like SVM and k-NN. It has been observed that obtaining the basis of representation and sparse codes are computationally costly operations affecting the performance of the system. We also propose a class-wise dictionary refinement algorithm and dynamic dictionary selection algorithm to make sparse coding faster. The addition of dictionary refinement to the classification system not only reduces the time taken for sparse coding but also gives improved classification accuracy. The outcomes of the study are empirical verification of sparse representation classifier as a text classification tool and a computationally efficient solution for the bottleneck operation of sparse coding.

AB Feature extraction from financial data is one of the most important problems in market prediction domain for which many approaches have been suggested. Among other modern tools, convolutional neural networks (CNN) have recently been applied for automatic feature selection and market prediction. However, in experiments reported so far, less attention has been paid to the correlation among different markets as a possible source of information for extracting features. In this paper, we suggest a CNN-based framework, that can be applied on a collection of data from a variety of sources, including different markets, in order to extract features for predicting the future of those markets. The suggested framework has been applied for predicting the next day's direction of movement for the indices of S&P 500, NAS-DAQ DAQ, DJI, NYSE, and RUSSELL based on various sets of initial variables. The evaluations show a significant improvement in prediction's performance compared to the state of the art baseline algorithms. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The characterization of cardiac function is of high clinical interest for early diagnosis and better patient follow-up in cardiovascular diseases. A large number of cardiac image analysis methods and more precisely in cine-Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) have been proposed to quantify both shape and motion parameters. However, the first major problem to address lies in the cardiac image segmentation that is most often needed to extract the myocardium before any other process such as motion tracking, or registration. Moreover, intelligent systems based on classification and learning techniques have emerged over the last years in medical imaging. In this paper, a new method is proposed to help medical experts in classifying the Left Ventricle (LV) wall motion without the need of image segmentation and through the learning of motion features by using dictionary learning techniques. Specifically the novelty of this approach lies in the extraction of new spatio-temporal descriptors and in the use of discriminative dictionary learning (DL) techniques to classify normal/abnormal LV function in cardiac MRI. Local radial spatio-temporal profiles are first extracted from bidimensional (2D) short axis (SAX) MRI images, for each anatomical segment of the LV cavity. These profiles inherently contain discriminatory information that can help for cardiac motion characterization. An advantage of this approach is that these profiles are constructed from a very limited user interaction that corresponds to a number of five points in only one frame of the sequence, (without the need of LV boundaries segmentation) and by exploiting all the phases of the cardiac cycle. Two specific discriminative DL algorithms have been selected for the LV wall classification based on these profiles: Label Consistent K-SVD (LC-KSVD) and Fisher Discriminative (FD-DL). For the application of the proposed methods, cine-MR SAX images have been collected from a control group of 9 healthy subjects and from 9 patients with cardiac dyssynchrony. Radial strain curves in 2D Speckle Tracking Echocardiography (2D-STE) have been analysed for the patient group and have been used as reference truth. They allowed to label each profile as normal or abnormal. The best performance has been achieved in the Wavelet domain by the LC-KSVD algorithm with an accuracy of 84.07% in the classification of radial spatio-temporal profiles and using a leave-one-out patient cross validation. The approach has been compared with recent methods of the literature and offers a good compromise between performance, user interaction, time computing and complexity. This new method of LV classification, with minimal user interaction and based on discriminative DL has not been previously reported. It could help to improve the performance of pre-screening systems for cardiac assessment, which can affect positively the quality of the early diagnosis for heart failure patients.

TI A new data clustering algorithm based on critical distance methodology

AB A variety of algorithms have recently emerged in the field of cluster analysis. Consequently, based on the distribution nature of the data, an appropriate algorithm can be chosen for the purpose of clustering. It is difficult for a user to decide a priori which algorithm would be the most appropriate for a given dataset. Algorithms based on graphs provide good results for this task. However, these algorithms are vulnerable to outliers with limited information about edges contained in the tree to split a dataset. Thus, in several fields, the need for better clustering algorithms increases and for this reason utilizing robust and dynamic algorithms to improve and simplify the whole process of data clustering has become an urgent need. In this paper, we propose a novel distance-based clustering algorithm called the critical distance clustering algorithm. This algorithm depends on the Euclidean distance between data points and some basic mathematical statistics operations. The algorithm is simple, robust, and flexible; it works with quantitative data that are real-valued, not qualitative, and categorical with different dimensions. In this work, 26 experiments are conducted using different types of real and synthetic datasets taken from different fields. The results prove that the new algorithm outperforms some popular clustering algorithms such as MST-based clustering, K-means, and Dbscan. Moreover, the algorithm can precisely produce more reasonable clusters even when the dataset contains outliers and without specifying any parameters in advance. It also provides a number of indicators to evaluate the established clusters and prove the validity of the clustering. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

ID PERFORMANCE
AB A kind of binder-free CNTs/(Ni-P)/Sn composites are designed and electroplated on Cu current collector as anodes for lithium-ion battery. The influence of the Ni-P alloys on the physical and electrochemical performance of the CNTs/Sn anode is examined. XPS emphatically exhibits the buildup of the chemical binding force at the surface of Sn-CNTs electrode formed by the alloying reaction of Sn and Ni elements. The CNTs/(Ni-P)/Sn composites exhibit remarkable cycle performances with a reversible specific capacity of 400 mAh g (1) after 100 cycles which is much higher than that of the CNTs/Sn electrodes, and deliver an excellent rate performance of 372.3 mAh g (1) at 4 C. The positive-going effect of combining CNTs with Ni-P alloys was experimentally established to ensure the significant improvement of the electrochemical performance for Sn anode.

AB Mercury sulphide (HgS) nanoparticles decorated single walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNT/HgS) were synthesized via a hydrothermal route. We investigated structural and photocatalytic properties of SWCNT/HgS nanohybrid. The diameter of pure SWCNTs and SWCNT/HgS as determined by Raman spectroscopy was 1.607 nm and 1.646 nm, respectively. Hexagonal phase of alpha-HgS nanoparticles decorated on SWCNTs was evidenced in HRTEM, SAED, XPS and XRD spectra. An increase in photocatalytic efficiency of SWCNT/HgS nanohybrid (99.08%) as compared to HgS NPs (73.0%) was observed for photodegradation of methylene blue (5 ppm) under sunlight. This study suggests a promising approach to rational design of advanced heterogeneous photocatalysts for environmental remediation. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A Li-doped graphitic carbon nitride (g-CNLi) was synthesized through a two-step method including the first ionothermal route and the following H2O2 treatment. Characterizations indicate that the crystal structure of g-CNLi resembles the intermediate without H(2)O(2 )treatment. However, compared to pristine graphitic carbon nitride (g-CN), g-(CNLi )presents significantly visible-light absorption enhancement. As a consequence, the photodegradation of methylene blue by g-CNLi is greatly improved under visible-light irradiation. Furthermore, Li atoms doping into g-CN might be responsible for the optical property of g-CNLi. The present work could provide a new insight into optimizing photocatalyst for efficient solar light utilization. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID BEHAVIOR; PLA
AB Bioresorbable cardiovascular stents are usually subjected to dynamic mechanical loads in vivo, which results in a different degradation profile compared to that measured under a static in vitro immersion test. In this study, a dynamic test platform was used to mimic cyclic pulsatile pressure and compared the changes in polymer properties of poly(p-dioxaone)/polycaprolane (PPDO/PCL) braided composite bioresorbable stents (BCBRSs) with static loading and non-loaded environments. The results showed static compressive load accelerated the changes in the hydrolysis process and crystallinity for polymers while the pulsatile pressure increased surface corrosion of the stent struts. Moreover, the degradation rate under dynamic loading was attenuated due to the mitigation of viscous flow of molecule chains and autocatalysis process, compared with that under static loading and non-loaded conditions.

The properties of GNS were characterized by scanning electron microscopy, tunneling electron microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and Raman spectroscopy. By applying Langmuir adsorption isotherm, the maximum adsorption capacity was calculated to be 25.84 mg/g, which is relatively high due to the effective interaction of As(III) and oxygenated functional groups available on the surface of as-prepared GNS.

AB Hollow mesoporous silica nanoparticles have been heavily explored as drug delivery vehicles due to their high drug loading capacity resulting from their interior cavities. Previously, hollow mesoporous silica nanoparticles were mainly prepared with pre-synthesized templates, such as iron oxide, solid silica, polystyrene and gold nanoparticles. Therefore multiple steps were required, which make the synthesis complex and relatively time consuming. Here, we reported a novel approach to obtain hollow mesoporous silica nanoparticles by using in-situ formed copper sulfide nanoparticles as temporary templates. Without pre-synthesized templates, hollow mesoporous silica nanoparticles can be obtained with minimum number of steps. The obtained nanoparticles with uniform morphology, excellent biocompatibility, high drug loading capacity and pH-responsive drug release behavior can be excellent drug delivery vehicles.

AB Solvent post-treatment of PEDOT:PSS conductive thin films have been shown to be an effective way to improve their electrical conductivity. However, such treatment could also have an impact on the performance stability and surface properties of PEDOT:PSS films. In the current work, PEDOT:PSS samples were prepared with different thicknesses and treated using a simple solvent post-treatment method. The electrical performance stability of the solvent post-treated films was investigated over prolonged time period. The electrical stability of the studied samples shows some dependence on their thickness. Moreover, reduced electrical performance degradation was noticed after solvent treatment. An alteration in the films wetting-dewetting properties after the treatment was also observed. The correlation between the surface properties and the improved performance stability of the treated PEDOT:PSS films is discussed in the light of the obtained results. Some remarks on the impact of solvent treatment on the performance of the treated-PEDOT:PSS films based devices are also given. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Trifluoroacetate metal organic deposition (TFA-MOD) with low fluorine contents would bring benefits for the environment and the epitaxial growth of YBa2Cu3Oy (YBCO) film. In this paper, a simple and effective method which could tune the fluorine content and improve the performance of YBCO film was reported. YBCO Low-Fluorine/YBCO Fluorine-Free composites were prepared on LaAlO3 single crystal substrate. During the pyrolysis process, the fluorine would diffuse across the interface of YBCO Low-Fluorine/YBCO Fluorine-Free composites. Both the fluorine in the YBCO Low-Fluorine and the carbon in the YBCO Fluorine-Free could be reduced. It could significantly improve the epitaxial growth and performance of YBCO film.

AB This paper presents the novel development of highly porous carbon nanotube (CNT)/shape memory polymer (SMP) nanocomposites for potential endovascular treatment of intracranial aneurysms (ICAs). Pristine SMP foam is fabricated using a sugar template method. CNT/SMP nanocomposites are fabricated by infiltrating CNTs into the pristine SMP foam in ethanol via ultrasonication. The porous nanocomposites are characterized to identify key parameters, such as the average pore size, density, porosity and electrical resistivity. A resistive-heating mechanism is developed to trigger shape recovery of the nanocomposites. The results of this work will lay a solid foundation for our subsequent development of new personalized biomedical devices to treat ICAs using a catheter-based endovascular procedure.

AB The present study reports microstructural observation during thermal treatment of 6063 aluminum alloy. Microscopic investigation employing low-energy electron and X-ray photoemission electron techniques was conducted. Work function pertaining thereto such techniques was analyzed. During the thermal treatment representing homogenization of the alloy, as-cast intermetallics transform morphologically from initial beta-AlFeSi to alpha-Al(FeMn)Si. The transformation is governed by elemental diffusion between the as-cast intermetallics and the aluminum matrix and by reversible wetting of grain boundaries. These lead to formation of discrete and globular particles of alpha-Al(FeMn)Si all over the aluminum matrix. This in-situ study reveals that the phase transformation is not taken place by nucleation of alpha-Al(FeMn)Si onto surfaces of beta-AlFeSi. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this work, a homogeneous defect-free ultrafine grained microstructure with an average grain size of 0.5 mu m was achieved in Ti-6Al-4V via high strain rate (10 s(-1)) deformation with a martensitic microstructure. At the initial stage, the alpha martensite decomposed into fine lamellar alpha + beta structures, leading to promotion of dynamic recrystallization (DRX). With the imposed strain increasing, substructures formed inside alpha lamellae and gradually transformed to new ultrafine grains through continuous dynamic recrystallization (CDRX). At the same time, beta phase nucleated and formed on the intervariant lath boundaries during the decomposition of alpha martensite. This study indicated that the phase transformation of alpha'/alpha+beta strongly contribute to the achievement of ultrafine grains. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have rapidly achieved power conversion efficiencies comparable to those of first generation c-Si and second generation thin film solar cell technologies. Although studies on upscaling of PSC technology for practical applications are growing, operation stability remains a challenge and need to be addressed. Ingress of ambient moisture into the device architecture and subsequent decomposition of organometal halide perovskite absorber is identified as one of the major reason for poor operational stability of PSCs. In this letter, we report a low temperature glass-to-glass encapsulation of PSCs using ultraviolet (UV) light curable epoxy edge sealant. Controlled UV irradiation induces epoxy cross-linking and hermitic glass-to-glass encapsulation at <50 degrees C and therefore device retains 85% of its original performance. Nevertheless, conventional encapsulation carried out using surlyn thermoplastic gasket at 120 degrees C decreased the device's original performance by about 25%. Preliminary stability studies carried out by aging the PSCs at 30 degrees C, 50% humidity show that UV cured epoxy edge sealing effectively prevent the moisture ingress and thus improve the device stability beyond 70 days.

AB A high strength ultra-heavy plate steel was studied to elucidate the mechanism responsible for the difference in strength and toughness between surface and core. The yield strength and tensile strength on the surface were 724 and 821 MPa, respectively, while the core had only 625 and 707 MPa. The -40 degrees C Charpy impact energy on the surface was 235 (+/- 7) J, while the core was only 128 (+/- 24) J. Electron backscattered diffraction (EBSD) indicated that the density of high angle grain boundaries (HAGBs) in the surface was significantly higher than that in the core. The density of HAGBs was greatly increased by the twin-related V1/V2 variant pairs, while the density of the low angle grain boundaries (LAGBs) in the core was higher because of more variant pairs such as V1/V4, V1/V8, etc. The transformation mode dominated by CP (closed-packed plane) grouping was formed on the surface because of high cooling rate, and lower cooling rate in the core resulted in a transformation mode dominated by Bain grouping.

AB In this work, a novel copper/bronze laminate was skillfully fabricated by diffusion welding. The impact resistance of such coarse-grained laminate was evaluated by Charpy notched impact testing and the evolution of its fracture mechanism was systematically elucidated. The well-bonded transition interfaces can effectively inhibit crack initiation and propagation under high impact loads. The enhanced impact toughness was achieved from delamination of heterostructured interfaces, which consumed high impact energy. Simultaneously, the coarse-grained copper/bronze layers can consume a large amount of impact energy via undergoing coordinated plastic deformation during the impact process. Consequently, this work broadens the enhancement methods on the mechanical performance of metallic materials by a new structural design strategy. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The current study investigates the fabrication of semiconducting molybdenum disulfide thin film using reactive magnetron sputtering technique at 300 degrees C for thin film transistors (TFTs) application. X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and Field emission-scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) techniques were used to identify the structural, elemental compositional and morphological properties of the synthesized thin film. XRD and Raman data confirm the growth of hexagonal structure and FE-SEM images indicate the vertical aligned layered morphology. The fabricated TFT demonstrates excellent performance in terms of field-effect mobility of 24.17 cm(2) V(-1)s(-1) and a high I-on/I-off  ratio of the order of 10(6). (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB Introducing a high density of defect sinks is a promising approach to relieve helium embrittlement in structural alloys for future fusion energy applications. However, the interaction between preset defect evolution and helium behavior at elevated temperatures, which could lead to dramatic changes of microstructure and properties of alloys, is still not well understood. In this contribution, cold-rolled nickel subjected to He+ irradiation at 500 degrees C was investigated to uncover the interaction process and the consequent microstructure evolution. Our experimental results revealed that during the initial period partial recrystallization and grain growth were unaffected by He+ irradiation, leading to the formation of coarse grains. With the increasing of helium concentration, helium bubbles retarded dislocation rearrangement and grain boundary migration in the remaining recrystallization areas, and meanwhile the stabilized grain boundaries facilitated helium bubble coarsening and bubble-to-void transformation. Such interaction ultimately led to the retention of fine grains with severe swelling and hardening. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB The thermal conductivity (lambda) of glass foams is thought to depend on pore size. We report on the impact of pore size, determined using X-ray microtomography, and percentage porosity on the lambda of glass foams. Glass foams were prepared by heating powder mixtures of obsolete cathode ray tube (CRT) panel glass, Mn3O4 and carbon as foaming agents, and K3PO4 as additive, to a suitable temperature above T-g, and subsequent cooling. Here, we report for the first time a correlation between and pore size in the range 0.10-0.16 mm showing a decrease from 57 to 49 mW m(-1) K-1 with increasing the pore size for glass foams with porosities of 87-90%. This indicates that the pore structure should be optimized in order to improve the insulating performance of glass foams. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Micro-nanostructure metal oxides derived from metal organic frameworks had attracted widely attention due to their potential application in high energy density lithium ion batteries. In this work, ZnO/Co3O4/CoO/Co composite materials were successfully synthesized by a facile approach through calcination of preformed Zn-Co-ZIF precursor and tested as anode materials for lithium ion batteries. This porous composite materials exhibit superior lithium storage capabilities with good cycling stability and rate capability. It demonstrates a reversible capacity (972.6 mA h g(-1) at 100 mA g(-1) after 100 cycles), excellent rate capability (681.2 mA h g(-1) at 1000 mA g(-1)). The enhanced electrochemical performance of the porous ZnO/Co3O4/CoO/Co hybrid composite materials can be ascribed to the synergetic effect of multi-component functional micro/nanoparticles systems.

AB Powdered and fibrous Li2FeSiO4/C (LFS/C) composites with similar carbon content were synthesized by traditional solid-state route and electrospinning technique, respectively, for investigating initial aqueous super-capacitive mechanisms. The relationship between the scan rate and response current revealed their storage mechanisms, indicating that the LFS/C-Fiber displays more capacitive contribution to the total energy compared to that of LFS/C-Powder. The improved capacitive contribution is attributed to the morphological characteristics that partially increased the insertion contribution compared to that of the capacitive one. Furthermore, compared to the "Area Effect (E-Area)", the "Size Effect (E-Size)" significantly increased the "real" capacitive part. Consequently, for the development of a high-rate and quick charge/discharge device, the morphological characteristic of synthesized composites should be considered as an essential factor.

AB The development of the metal-free materials with hollow core-shell construction as higher efficient catalysts in related energy conversion field is still a great challenge. This structure usually possesses a larger specific surface area. However, the catalytic activity of dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) is weakened due to its fewer active edge sites. Here, a novel strategy is described by building a category of N, S doped hollow core-shell carbon microspheres (N, S-HCCS) in the process of simple easy operation. The electrochemical measurements include electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, Tafel polarization measurements and cyclic voltammetry, which unravel the outstanding electrocatalytic activities of N, S-HCCS as counter electrode (CE) for iodine ion. The photoelectric conversion efficiency (PCE) value of the whole cell reaches 8.03%, which is far larger than Pt's value (7.52%). (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB We demonstrate that the sensitivity of grain sizes to precursor CH3NH3I/PbI2 molar ratio can be promoted by hydroiodic acid additive for one-step spin-coated CH3NH3PbI3 film. Thus, the full-coverage, high-crystallinity CH3NH3PbI3 film with average grain size of similar to 1.75 mu m can be obtained by simply adjusting precursor molar ratio. Planar perovskite solar cell (PSC) with this desired film yields the optimized efficiency of 19.29%. Hence, our work suggests a facile precursor stoichiometry engineering through the assistance of hydroiodic acid to obtain efficient CH3NH3PbI3 PSCs. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Zirconium Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs, UiO-66 and UiO-67) have been used for the removal from aqueous solutions of persistent fluorinated pollutants, perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS). The two isostructural materials differ in cavity size, defined by the ligand, bdc (benzene-dicarboxylic acid) or bpdc (biphenyl-dicarboxylic acid) for UiO-66 and UiO-67 respectively. Both materials enable efficient sorption of PFOA and PFOS. Sorption kinetics and isotherms have been experimentally determined, and thermodynamic parameters Delta H degrees, Delta S degrees and Delta G degrees have been determined. UiO-67 shows higher sorption capacities (up to 743 mg.g(-1) for PFOA and 585 mg.g(-1) for PFOS) compared to these of UiO-66 (388 and 160 mg.g(-1) for the sorption of PFOA and PFOS respectively) with a change in the sorption mechanism.

AB We report a method to increase the efficiency of radio-frequency (RF) generated plasma for surface modification of electrospun biomaterials by introducing magnetization. The x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) reveals the oxygen/carbon ratio is consistently higher for various exposure times for magnetized plasma than non-magnetized plasma. The principle demonstrated here supports the use of magnetic fields as an additional controllable parameter in plasma processing of biomaterials and is extendable to other plasma sources. The surface activation and functionalization of biomaterials has impact in the broader arena of tissue engineering applications in that magneto-plasma processing (MPP) enables us to tune the shape of plasma plume for selective enhanced functionalization of surface of scaffolds, which in turn has wide applications for basic cell-patterning science and in applied regenerative medicine.

AB In this work, we present a method to improve the mechanical properties of CNF films by replacing the secondary hydrogen bonding in CNF films with glutaraldehyde (GA)-based covalent bonds using acidic catalysts. The CNF film treated with GA exhibits similar to 180% higher tensile strength than that for the untreated CNF film. In terms of the elastic modulus, the film shows a value of 12.3 GPa, which is similar to 160% higher compared to the untreated CNF film. Using Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) analyses on the films, it was found that the mechanical properties of the GA-treated films were significantly affected by the relationship between the degree of GA cross-linking and the reduction in the crystallinity index of the CNFs.

AB Using titanium (Ti) for clinical implants often requires surface modification to improve long-term stability and biological activity. However, due to the presence of stable oxide film, modifying the surface of Ti by chemical conversion is difficult. In this research, an electro-assisted method was used to rapidly form chemical transformation coatings on Ti. The effects of Fe2+ and temperature on the phase composition, microstructures, properties, and the formation mechanism of coatings were investigated. The temperature affected the hydrogen evolution by changing the overpotential of hydrogen, thereby affecting the composition of the coatings. The coatings formed at 60 degrees C were mainly composed of hopeite, whereas those formed at 30 degrees C mainly composed of elemental zinc (Zn). Fe2+ promoted the reduction of Zn2+ by abnormal co-deposition with Zn2+ and then changed the morphology and properties of the conversion coating. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The Cs2CO3 is incorporated onto TiO2 electron transport layer, which leads to an increase of power conversion efficiency from 5.25% to 6.88%. The introduction of Cs2CO3 modification layer can improve the contact between active layer and electron transport layer, and the ultrathin Cs2CO3 layer hardly hinders the electron transport due to the quantum tunneling effect, resulting in the improvement of short circuit current and the fill factor.

AB In this work, 60 mm thick Ti-6Al-4V plates were joined by narrow-gap multi-pass gas tungsten arc welding (GTAW) technology to investigate microstructure and deformation resistance of joints. Depending on cooling condition, mixed weld microstructure consists of stable alpha phase, martensite alpha' phase and few retained beta phase. Hardness of joined parts is higher than base metal (BM) mainly contributed by martensite strengthening. A simplified model was established to reveal microstructure evolution during welding thermal cycle. It can also demonstrate that different thermal action effect is responsible for distinct microstructure forms especially martensite alpha', which varies hardness in different regions of joints.

ID QUANTUM DOTS; PERFORMANCE; NANOFIBERS; REMOVAL
AB Wide band-gap semiconductor TiO2 is an efficient anode material for photo-electrocatalytical (PEC) applications. Its light-sensitivity is limited to the UV but can be extended to the visible by chemical doping or chromophore sensitization. Moreover, its conductivity can be enhanced by coupling with carbon materials, which should limit back electron-hole recombination. In this context, we prepared heteronanostructures based on TiO2 nanofibers supported on Ti sheet and impregnated with carbon dots (CDs), and used them as photo-anodes in photo-electrochemical cells. They showed a higher photocurrent than non-CD-impregnated photo-anodes, underlining the importance of CDs for water-splitting processing. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Herein, we report the hardening effect of Al in CoCrNi medium-entropy alloys. Al contents of up to 25 at% were added to CoCrNi and hardness measurements and phase investigation of the as-cast alloys were subsequently performed. The hardness of the as-cast alloys increased with increasing Al content and the BCC/B2 and sigma phase fraction increased as well. An additional hardness measurement was performed on cold-rolled and annealed alloys, and revealed a sharp increase in the hardness of Al7.7CoCrNi. Microstructural analysis of Al7.7CoCrNi was also performed and significant heterogeneous precipitation of the B2 phase was observed. Our findings demonstrated that heterogeneous precipitation owing to Al addition resulted in the abrupt hardening of Al7.7CoCrNi. However, the retarded grain growth due to heterogeneous precipitation may have more significantly contributed to the hardening effect. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID NITROGEN
AB c-oriented Cu doped epsilon-Fe2-3N films are fabricated on c-Al2O3 by magnetron sputtering. It is found that the crystal constant c decreases with increasing Cu doping amount, which is due to the smaller radius of Cu atoms. The XPS peaks of Fe 2p and Cu 2p are confirmed with Fe-N and Cu-N binding energy determined. The saturation magnetizations decrease with increasing Cu doping amount, which are attributed to the weakening of Fe-Fe ferromagnetic coupling by Cu doping. Furthermore, the temperature dependences of (R-T-R-300 (K))/R-300 K indicate that the resistivity variations with changing temperature are weakened by Cu doping. The manipulable magnetic and transport properties by Cu doping may provide a new method of designing spintronic devices. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this work, an innovative approach to covalently anchor cyclodextrins (CDs) on the surface of submi-crometric particles, prepared from an equimolar mixture of poly(L-lactide) (PLLA) and poly(D-lactide) (PDLA), was developed. The idea of the applied method lays in the potential reactivity of amino CDs towards the polymer functionalities to produce an aminolysis reaction, which should lead to the direct grafting of cyclodextrin molecules on the polymer surface. A preliminary investigation demonstrated the significant capacity of the modified particles to adsorb a model pollutant (alizarin red) and a hydrophobic drug (ketoprofen). (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB Hierarchical zeolite Beta has been successfully synthesized by adding graphene oxide (GO) in the hydrothermal system and characterized by XRD, SEM and N-2 adsorption-desorption. The results show that the mesoporous distribution of the hierarchical zeolite Beta can be adjusted in the range of 3-7 nm and the meso-porosity can be varied by changing the type and content of GO. The formation of mesoporous structure in the zeolitic particles is from that the growth of crystalline is blocked in part by GO attached onto the zeolitic crystalline surface. Compared to spherical structure of GO nanopowders, laminar structure of GO nanosheets is propitious to increase the connectivity of the mesopores in the zeolite materials. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB Triethylamine (TEA), a high-molecular amine, has a terrible desorption rate on oxide surfaces, and it remains a challenge to develop a rapid response sensor to detect it. Herein, Cr-doped alpha-MoO3 nanorods have been prepared through a grinding and subsequent annealing route. The microstructure of the as-obtained Cr-doped alpha-MoO3 nanorods was determined using various analysis techniques. Sensing experiments showed that the Cr-doped alpha-MoO3 nanorods exhibit a significant response for TEA, with actual concentrations as low as 1 ppm at 200 degrees C. Moreover, the sensor can be completely recovered after a TEA-sensing event in less than 2 min using pulse-heating at 300 degrees C in air. In addition, an ultrahigh selectivity for TEA against other vapors was observed. This doping method, combined with a pulse-heating technique, may act as an efficient strategy for designing a high-performance gas sensor. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this study, we demonstrated that low density organosilica monoliths (LDM) containing hollow silica nanospheres (HSNS) may have a great potential for the use as thermal insulation materials. First, hydrophilic and hydrophobic HSNS have been prepared by a simple sol-gel method and have an average diameter centered around 120 nm and a shell thickness between 10 and 15 nm. LDM containing HSNS have then been prepared as solid cylindric materials without cracks and with a low bulk density of about 0.17 g/cm(3). LDM containing hydrophobic HSNS have shown a measured thermal conductivity of about 0.031 W/(mK), compared to 0.045 W/(mK) of the corresponding LDM without HSNS. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Additionally, NH3-sensing measurements were performed based on both samples. Remarkably, the loosely-arranged WO3 nanostructures, which possess an abundance of semi-closed spaces and a larger specific surface area, exhibited improved NH3-sensing properties compared to that of the tightly-arranged WO3 nanostructures. This discovery can provide guidance for improving the gas-sensing properties of nanosheet-assembled hierarchical MO x flower-like nanostructures. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A facile and rapid method was developed for preparing aerogel from polysulfonamide (PSA) via sol-gel process. Through hydrogen bond fracture and regeneration between PSA molecules in the solvents of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and tetra-n-butylammonium fluoride (TBAF), a three-dimensional network structure of PSA aerogel is formed. The obtained PSA aerogel shows high compression strength of 3.25 MPa, and also exhibits the density of 0.06 g/cm(3) and the porosity of 88%, respectively. Moreover, the water contact angle of the PSA aerogel surface is 95 degrees, which suggests good water resistance and dimensional stability for application in oil and water separation, filtration and other fields.

For the deposition of calcium phosphate (CaP) coatings of different phase compositions, the temperature-dependent solubility phenomenon of calcium orthophosphates at a fixed solution pH was used. DCPD and calcium-deficient HA (Ca/P = 1.64) coatings were obtained at substrate temperatures of 85 degrees C and 140 degrees C, respectively. For 30 min of deposition, a 300 mu m thick HA coating consisting of both needle- and plate-shaped crystals of 4 mu m and a 50 mu m thick DCPD coating with needle-like crystals of 7 mu m were obtained. Porous morphologies were characteristic of both coatings. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The coherent nanotwins have been observed in intergranular M6C carbides in GH3535 alloy. Unlike the simple face-centered cubic (FCC) crystals, M6C carbides with a complex FCC lattice possess a complex periodic stacking along the {1 1 1} planes, from which four different potential configurations of the coherent nanotwin interface have been derived. Based on the simplified Ni3Mo3C supercell, the twin boundary energies and the relaxed structure of the four configurations were calculated and compared with each other using first-principle calculation, which indicate that the twined structure with NiMo-2 layer as twinning interface is most energetically favorable and structurally perfect.

AB Optical properties of blast furnace slag based geopolymers synthesized at 60 degrees C with additions of 4, 12 and 20% of Sr2.9Eu0.03DY0.07Al4SiO11 (SEDASO) are studied. In the photoluminescence spectra, the geopolymers exhibit two broad emission bands: in the blue region (persistence at 490 nm) due to 4f(6) 5d(1) -> 4f(7) transitions of Eu2+ and in the red region (at 634 nm), produced by the Mn2+ and Fe3+ present in the geopolymer matrix, generating excitation-wavelength dependent emissions. The quantum yield of emission is enhanced 80% when SEDASO additions are increased from 4% to 20%, with maximum times of light persistence of 233 s. The formation of a micro-interface between the geopolymer matrix and SEDASO is established by means of SEM analysis, which favors stability in the paste, and simultaneously allows greater interaction between incident light and SEDASO. It is envisioned that these emission properties in geopolymers could be used for application in the construction industry, i.e., as luminescent pavement. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID PROCESS PARAMETERS; STEEL
AB Ultra-fine grained AA6061 coating was fabricated on the Q235 substrate by friction surfacing (FS). The grains of the coating were highly refined and equaixed due to the continuous dynamic recrystallization, and the precipitations were well-redistributed. As a result, the grain size and the fraction of low angle boundaries significantly declined. The A(1)* and A(2)* shear textural components were found in the FS coating. Furthermore, the corrosion current of the coating was less than that of the base materials, and the passive potential of the coating increased. The corrosion resistance of the passive file and aluminum alloy were both promoted after FS according to the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In the present work, the effects of thickness reduction per pass introduced by differential speed rolling (DSR) on microstructure and texture evolutions and related mechanical properties of interstitial-free (IF) steel samples were investigated. For this purpose, the samples were subjected to DSR deformation at various per-pass-thickness reductions; 10% (14 passes), 30% (4 passes), and 50% (2 passes). The results showed that the DSR deformation at a high thickness reduction per pass (50%) leads to ultrafine grained structure (similar to 0.5 mu m) with significant fractions of high angle grain boundaries (HAGBs). This structure was conjugated with a high strength and low ductility as compared to those in the non-deformed sample. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Herein, we report an effective bacterial anti-adhesive and bactericidal coating based on a Schiff-base reaction. The hydrophilic polyoxyethylene-bis-amine (PEG-bis-amine) is introduced in the system to endow the coating with valid bacterial anti-adhesive performance, while the tobramycin (Tob) with multi-amines serves as both a bactericidal agent and one of the cross-linkers for the construction of polyimide networks. The coating is obtained via a facile solvent-annealing method. This type of dual-functional antibacterial coating may provide as an excellent antibacterial platform for broad applications in bactericidal surfaces. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this paper, SnS nanotubes are firstly prepared in acidic solution by template free electrodeposition method at room temperature. The morphological evolution and photoelectrochemical properties of SnS nanotubes are investigated. X-ray diffraction (XRD), energy dispersive X-ray spectrometry (EDS) and Raman spectra measurements examine the phase purities of deposited SnS thin films. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) characterizations indicate morphological properties of SnS nanotubes. The band-gap of SnS nanotubes is confirmed by UV-Vis-NIR diffuse reflection spectra. The photoelectrochemical measurements show that the photocurrent density of FTO/SnS nanotubes is about 31 mu A/cm(2) and maximum IPCE value of SnS nanotubes is 7.4%. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB Aligned orientation can affect the performance of thermoelectric materials with lamella microstructures. A series of Cu2Se bulk samples have been sintered by Cu2Se powders with different grain size. Results show that aligned orientation of the bulk samples has been tuned by their different grain size. The sample sintered by 120 mu m-180 mu m Cu2Se powder has obtained more obviously aligned microstructures than other samples, which can provide more passageways for the liquid-like Cu+ ions and is beneficial for increasing the scattering of both carriers and phonons. Eventually, although getting a lower PF, due to its extremely decreased kappa, the highest ZT value of 1.25 at 923 K has been obtained for the sample sintered by 120 mu m-180 mu m Cu2Se powder, which is about 20% higher than 1.05 of other sample. This research suggests that the thermoelectric performance of Cu2Se can be optimized by tuning the appropriate grain size and aligned lamella microstructure. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Compared with ZnS particles, ZnS micropolyhedrons demonstrated excellent electrocatalytic reduction from triiodide to iodide as a counter electrode due to ZIF-8 skeleton. The ordered polyhedrons achieved lower electron transport impedance than that of the chaotic particle structure.

The results indicate that HA without decomposition and phase transformation is well contained and evenly distributed in the composite powders and coating. The simulated body fluid (SBF) test shows that bone-like apatite layer is mineralized on the surface of composite coating after 1-3 days. It demonstrates that the as-prepared Ta/HA composite coating has high bioactivity. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The flower-like BiOI/Bi5O7I heterojunction photocatalysts were prepared by a pH adjustment method, and the photocatalytic oxidation activity of the as-prepared samples was investigated by gas-phase Hg-0 removal. XRD, SEM, TEM, UV-vis, and PL characterization analysis method were adopted to evaluate the physicochemical property of samples. It was found that the sample showed an excellent photocatalytic performance for mercury removal when the pH of the sample fabrication arrived at 10.0. It can be attributed to the formation of an interfacial heterojunction between BiOI and Bi5O7I, which inhibits the recombination of electrons and holes. A possible photocatalytic reaction mechanism for the oxidation of Hg-0 has also been proposed. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Porous microspheres, which can provide sufficient internal space for cell in-growth and protect cells during injection have attracted widespread attention in bone tissue engineering. Hydroxyapatite (HA)/polymer composite scaffolds have been fabricated for bone tissue engineering. The combination between HA and polymer matrix generally includes two modes, physical mixing and chemical grafting. Deciding which combination mode have better effect on osteogenic differentiation is of great importance for bone tissue engineering. Herein, HA and poly (gamma-benzyl-L-glutamate) (PBLG) composites were fabricated by physical mixing or chemical grafting. The effect of two combination modes on cellular proliferation and osteogenic differentiation on the microspheres were analyzed and compared. Rather than the mixture of HA and PBLG (HA/PBLG), hydroxyapatite-graft-poly (gamma-benzyl-L-glutamate) (HA-g-PBLG) microspheres show a more homogeneous distribution of HA and have higher porosity. The rabbit-adipose-derived stem cells (r-ADSCs) seeded in HA-g-PBLG microspheres exhibited more uniform osteogenic differentiation and higher expression of osteogenic genes than those in HA/PBLG microspheres. In summary, the chemical grafting is a better strategy to construct the HA/PBLG composite for bone tissue engineering. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Natural deep eutectic solvents (NADES) are a green, promising class of solvents. Phenolic compounds are among the targets of NADES' use in foods. A health claim is admitted by European Regulations for olive oils (OOs) containing at least 250 mg kg(-1) of selected polyphenols (hydroxytyrosol and its derivatives, included tyrosol, HTD), but their determination involves analytical issues that are being currently debated. A NADES based on glucose and lactic acid was here used to develop a green and rapid tool for correct labelling of OOs. 163 OOs were submitted to liquid/liquid extraction with the NADES. Regression and classification approaches were adopted to relate features of the UV spectra of extracts to HTD content. The models allowed to assess HTD content for screening purposes (R-prediction(2) = 0.84, RMSEP = 35.5 mg kg(-1)). For labelling purposes, oils could be labelled according to health claim limits with an error of 0.6%.

AB The feasibility of producing proliposomes containing curcumin, as well as liposome dispersions, using different mixtures of purified and nonpurified soybean phospholipids was studied. Proliposomes were produced through coating of micronized sucrose and physicochemically characterized over 30 days of storage. In addition, the possible interactions among the components were investigated using X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR). The proliposomes demonstrated a low propensity of water adsorption and low hygroscopicity. In addition, the curcumin content retained in the powders ranged from 67 to 92%. The liposomes were produced following proliposome hydration. Atomic force microscopy indicated the vesicles presented spherical shapes and photon correlation spectroscopy detected that their hydrodynamic diameters ranged from 207 to 222 nm. Finally, the curcumin-loaded liposomes preserved up to 63% of the bioactive compound but remained stable for only 15 days of storage.

AB The post-thawing quality, metabolite profile and amino acid oxidation of frozen pork tenderloin following the use of a high-voltage electrostatic field (HVEF) were investigated in this study. There were not significant differences of pH for pork thawed by air and HVEF, which were consistent with the lactic acid level and glycogen content. No changes in the tenderness of thawed pork were found. There were only 6 volatiles with different contents in the pork tenderloin (P < 0.05). Moreover, there were no oxidized cysteine and methionine residues in myosin of thawed pork by HVEF. A total of 23 discriminating metabolites between the air-thawed and HVEF-thawed pork after orthogonal partial least squares-discriminate analysis (OPLS-DA). There were 10 pathways containing > 5 discriminating metabolites, among them, there were 10 discriminating metabolites in the glycerophospholipid metabolism (ssc00564) and retrograde endocannabinoid signaling (ssc04723). The glycerophospholipid metabolism could be related to the pork spoilage processes.

AB The aim of this research was to prepare ethanol-induced cold-set emulsion gels contain different content of oil and to investigate the effect on the rheological, textural, and microstructural properties. The results showed that the gelation rate, gel strength, water-holding capacity (WHC), and hardness of the ethanol-set emulsion gels improved as the content of oil increased. Rheological analysis showed that the emulsion gels changed from combined polymer/particle gel behavior at low oil contents to particle gel behavior at high oil contents. The emulsion gels contained a three-dimensional network of aggregated oil droplets at high oil contents, while they contained an even distribution of isolated droplets at lower oil contents. The results showed that the properties of the ethanol-set emulsion gels could be modulated by altering the oil content because the oil droplets acted as active fillers. Ethanol-induced gelation presents an intriguing possibility for encapsulation of alcohol-soluble, lipid-soluble and heat-labile bioactive compounds.

AB The formation of toxic disinfection by-products (DBPs) is among the main concerns in the use of chlorine sanitizers for washing fresh and fresh-cut produce to minimize microbial cross-contamination. Even so, robust analytical methods for measuring various DBPs in produce have been lacking. This study has established two liquid-liquid extraction methods, followed by gas chromatography with electron capture detection, to measure 32 conventional and emerging DBPs in different produce types including lettuce, cabbage and strawberry. Good recoveries (50-130%) were achieved for most DBPs in the different produce. The method detection limits were in the range of 0.3-10 ng/g for trihalomethanes, haloacetic acids, nitrogenous DBPs, and other carbonaceous DBPs. Preliminary screening analysis indicated one-third of the target DBPs were found in unwashed produce, and washing with chlorine significantly promoted DBPs' formation and concentrations in the produce. The developed analytical methods will be useful tools for future research on food DBPs.

AB Carnauba wax is widely used in food, due to its physico-chemical characteristics with a predominance of esters and inert and stable components. Even with so many possibilities for the use of carnauba wax in food, there are still a large number of researchers around the world searching for new applications and a demand for new products with new technologies to improve existing ones. Recently, many parts of research which focus on the use of this wax in conservation and food processing have been carried out, some of which highlight the role of this wax in the microencapsulation of flavours, in preparing edible films and super hydrophobic and biodegradable packaging. This paper discusses the use of carnauba wax in food, including the extraction process of the wax, its chemical and physical characteristics, safety aspects, national and international law and permitted uses, along with the presentation of the main scientific research conducted.

AB Influence of heat pump drying (HP at 40, 45 and 50 degrees C), tray drying (TD) and sun drying (SD) on the quality of Arabica coffee was evaluated. Drying process did not affect the caffeine content, but influenced levels of some amino acids. Sucrose content was higher in HP and TD than in SD green coffees. The perceived aroma of brewed coffee from SD was similar to HP, but differed from TD. Concentrations of 30 important odorants were compared for SD, HP (50 degrees C) and TD brewed coffees. 2-Furfurylthiol, a key odorant of coffee, was at the same level in SD and HP coffees and lowest in TD samples. Principal component analysis (PCA) separated SD from HP and TD, based on the concentrations of 23 odorants. Combined results of sensory and chemical analyses showed that in comparison to SD, HP was superior to TD for preserving overall flavor quality.

AB Analytical methods for authenticity testing of organically grown vegetables are urgently needed. Here we present a novel method for organic authentication based on stable isotope ratio analysis of oxygen in plant-derived sulphate. We combined this method with stable isotope ratio analysis of bulk plant tissue and plant-derived nitrate to discriminate organic and conventional potato, carrot, and cabbage from rigidly controlled long-term field trials and from a case study using retail potatoes. It was shown that oxygen isotope ratios of sulphate from organic vegetables were significantly lower compared to their conventional counterparts and the values were directly linked to the fertilisation strategy. The classification power of sulphate isotope analysis was superior compared to known bulk tissue isotope markers and nitrate isotope values. In conclusion, oxygen isotope analysis of plant-derived sulphate represents a promising new method for authentication of organic vegetables.

AB The effect of cold atmospheric plasma (CAP) on protein concentrate from squid (Argentinus ilex) mantle has been evaluated in terms of gel properties, protease inhibition, texture profile, color attributes, and water holding capacity. Different exposure time (15, 60, 120, 180, 240 and 300 s) at 60 kV have been employed. Our results indicated that protease activity decreases with increasing treatment time. The highest reduction (p < 0.05) in protease activity (64%) was observed after 240 s of CAP treatment. Texture profile analysis, color properties and water holding capacity of the treated squid gel revealed a significant increase. Protein carbonyl and sulfhydryl group contents findings' showed a significant increase in carbonyl content (about three times of the original content), while the total sulfhydryl group decreased (up to about 40%) in the crude extract. Microstructure and SDS-PAGE analysis revealed a high degree of protein aggregation in the squid gel treated with CAP.

AB Monogastric animals exhibit different biological responses to structurally diverse glucosinolates and their transformation products, depending on the dietary levels. The transformations of 2-hydroxyalkenyl and aromatic glucosinolates were examined in vitro under gastric conditions, ex vivo in ligated porcine stomachs and in vivo in a rat model.
   Intact glucosinolates were almost completely transformed in vitro within 1 h at pH 3 (73-88%) and at pH 5 (97-100%) upon addition of Fe2+ ranging from two-fold molar excess. Glucosinolate transformations reached 78-99% when incubated ex vivo in ligated porcine stomachs. Rat in vivo feeding trials showed major reductions (81-84%) in the intact glucosinolate contents upon passage through the gastrointestinal (GI) tract.
   Non-enzymatic transformations of glucosinolates occur in the stomach, where pH and the level of Fe2+ are primary determinants. This is the first study to show a complex formation between iron-progoitrin and ironsinalbin, facilitating the transformation into nitriles and thionamides.

AB The effects of temperature, light, and pH on the stability of fucoxanthin in an oil-in-water emulsion were investigated with analyzing the kinetics and thermodynamics of fucoxanthin degradation. In the absence of light and air at pH 4.6, increasing the temperature from 25 to 60 degrees C significantly promoted fucoxanthin degradation. Total and all-trans fucoxanthin demonstrated an energetically unfavorable, non-spontaneous degradation with an Arrhenius temperature dependence. Increasing the light intensity up to 2000 lx at 25 degrees C and pH 4.6 caused a sharp degradation of total, all-trans, 13-cis, and 13'-cis fucoxanthin, but promoted the formation of the 9'-cis isomer. In the absence of light and air at 25 degrees C, decreasing the pH to 1.2 caused significant fucoxanthin degradation, whereas increasing the pH to 7.4 retarded the degradation. The property with the greatest influence on fucoxanthin stability was pH, followed by temperature and then light. Total and all-trans fucoxanthin followed first-order degradation kinetics.

AB We present a study of the hydration shells of some carbohydrate polymers of commercial and biological importance, namely, agave fructans, inulin, and maltodextrin, employing terahertz time-domain spectroscopy and differential scanning calorimetry. We observe that the hydration numbers calculated using terahertz spectroscopy are marginally higher than those of the calorimetric values. We attribute this discrepancy to the definition of hydration number, which in a way correlates with the physical process used to quantify it. The aqueous solutions show a non-proportional increase in the absorption coefficient and the hydration number, with a decrease in the carbohydrate concentration. We demonstrate that this behavior is consistent with the "chaotropic" or "structure breaking" model of the hydration shell around the carbohydrates. In addition, the study reveals that agave fructans and inulin have good hydration ability. Given the high glass transition temperature and good hydration ability, these carbohydrates may behave as good bio-protectants and hydrating additives for food and beverages.

AB This study was aimed to determine the relationship of flavonoid structures to their affinity for an important efflux transporter, multidrug-resistant associated protein 2 (MRP2). The cellular uptake (CU) of 35 flavonoids was investigated in MRP2 overexpression MDCK/MRP2 cells. Resulting data identified 8 flavonoids as MRP2 substrates based on their high CUMK with MK-571 in MDCK/MRP2 cells. Also, three substrates showed better CUMD in MDCK cells than did CUMRP in MDCK/MRP2 cells. Docking analyses showed a good correlation (R = 0.926, p = 0.003) between efflux-fold of flavonoid substrates and their docking S_scoring with the MRP2 model, indicating consistency between in silico and in vitro approaches. A structure affinity relationship (SAR) study indicated that 3-OH, 5-OH, 6-OH, 3'-OH, and 4'-OCH3 substituents were favourable while, 8-OCH3 , 2'-OH, 3'-OCH3 , 4'-OH and 5'-OH were unfavourable for flavonoid affinity to MRP2. Our study provides valuable information for dietary application of flavonoids with specific structures for high absorption.

AB The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of the ingestion of different white grape juices: organic, conventional and conventional grape juice with 5% lemon juice during adolescence on biochemical serum profile and oxidative stress level in liver of adult Wistar rats. The phenolic and vitamin C composition of the juices were evaluated. During 32 days the rats were treated with the juices or oral water (gavage) for at a dose of 7 mu L/g body weight. The animals were divided into 4 groups (n = 16/each). In the end, half of the animals received an intraperitoneal CCl4 injection of 3.0 mL/kg; the other ones received mineral oil. After euthanasia, biochemical parameters were evaluated in serum and oxidative stress in the liver. It is possible to emphasize that the juices have different phenolic and vitamin C contents. The juice consumption didn't alter the weight body and biochemical parameters in adult life.

AB This study investigated the gelation properties of composite gels prepared with golden threadfin bream myosin and 2% (w/v) deacetylated konjac glucomannan under different high pressure processing (HPP). Deacetylated konjac glucomannan increased the immobilized water and increased the gel strength of myosin gel, which were further increased under moderate pressure level (0.1-300 MPa) but decreased under strong pressure level (400-500 MPa). HPP induced unfolding of myosin and the partial transformation of a-helix into other structures (beta-sheet, beta-turn and random coil). Dynamic rheological tests indicated that storage modulus of the pressurised myosin was increased to maximum under 100 MPa. Scanning electron microscopy images revealed that HPP at 300 MPa produced a compact networked microstructure. Moreover, the molecular forces analysis proved that the increase in immobilized water of pressurised gels was mainly attributed to enhanced hydrogen bonds and electrostatic interactions, while the HPP-induced hydrophobic interactions were dominating mechanism to improve gel strength.

AB Procyanidins (PCs) are polyphenols highly accumulated in litchi fruit (Litchi chinensis). Despite their bioactivity, the molecular composition of native and oxidized procyanidins is little understood. In this paper, polyphenols from litchi pericarp were extracted using two solvents (methanol and acetone). The mean degree of polymerization (mDP) of native and identification of oxidized PCs were carried out by phloroglucinolysis- and thioglycolysis-HPLC-ESI-MS/MS, respectively. About 60% of extracted polyphenols corresponded to procyanidins from litchi pericarp. Native PCs were mainly oligomeric procyanidins (mDP 4). Only (-)-epicatechin was detected as terminal and extension units in PCs. Thioglycolysis-HPLC-ESI-MS identified five oxidation markers of PCs with [M - H](-) m/z 575, 593, 609, 679 and 863. Intra- and intermolecular modifications of A and B-type procyanidins were identified. The method used for the characterization of PCs from litchi pericarp allowed understanding of the structural composition of its native and oxidized tannins.

AB trans-Resveratrol, a natural polyphenol present in grapes, has many beneficial effects to human health. However, measurement of trans-resveratrol is technically complicated and time-consuming. In the present study, we obtained a sensitive and specific monoclonal antibody (mAb), namely 3C9, against trans-resveratrol. An indirect competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (icELISA) was developed, with 50% inhibitory concentration and working range of 1.0 ng/mL and 0.19-4.9 ng/mL, respectively. A lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA) based on 3C9 was also developed for the semiquantitative detection of trans-resveratrol in an indicator range of 50-100 ng/mL. Average recoveries of trans-resveratrol spiked in red and green grape berries samples were respectively 88-107% and 83-102% by icELISA. The icELISA and LFIA were applied for determination of transresveratrol in grape berries. The results were highly consistent with those determined by high-performance liquid chromatography analysis (R-2 = 0.9997). Therefore, we conclude that the immunoassay methods are suitable for the large-scale screening of trans-resveratrol in grape quality breeding.

AB This study examined the effect of herring antifreeze protein (hAFP) combined with chitosan magnetic nanoparticles (CS@Fe3O4), applied through vacuum impregnation, on protein conformation and moisture state of red sea bream during freeze-thaw cycles. DSC and dynamic rheology were used to analyze physicochemical changes. Raman, intrinsic fluorescence and second derivative UV spectrometry were used to explore the structural changes of myofibrillar proteins. Surface hydrophobicity, particle size and zeta-potential were used to analyze protein aggregation and denaturation. AV, POV, and TBA were used to determine the degree of lipid oxidation. LF-NMR and MRI were used to test water migration and distribution. The results indicated that pretreatment of red sea bream through vacuum impregnation with hAFP combined with CS@Fe3O4 solutions could minimize freeze-thaw damage, prevent protein and lipid oxidation. Therefore, these results confirm the importance of hAFP as a valuable food additive in frozen foods.

AB Starches were isolated from vitreous and floury endosperms from the same kernels, and their physicochemical properties were investigated to reveal their differences. Starch from vitreous endosperm had more surface indentations, larger granule size, and higher contents of protein, amylose and damaged starch than that from floury endosperm. Both starches from vitreous and floury endosperms exhibited A-type crystalline structure, but starch from vitreous endosperm had lower relative crystallinity and lamellar peak intensity than that from floury endosperm. Starch from floury endosperm had higher gelatinization temperature and enthalpy but lower gelatinization temperature range and percentage of retrogradation than that from vitreous endosperm. Native starch from floury endosperm was more resistant to enzyme hydrolysis than that from vitreous endosperm. Gelatinized and retrograded starches had similar digestion properties between starches from vitreous and floury endosperms. Principal component analysis indicated that starches from vitreous and floury endosperms had significant differences in their physicochemical properties.

AB Carotenoids are lipophilic phytochemicals; their intake has been associated with reduced chronic diseases. However, their absorption depends on emulsification during digestion and incorporation into mixed micelles, requiring digestive enzymes, gastric peristalsis, bile, and dietary lipids. In this study, we investigated whether whey-protein-isolate (WPI), a commonly consumed protein source, can modulate beta-carotene bioaccessibility in vitro, especially under incomplete digestive conditions, i.e. under low digestive enzyme concentrations. Thus, amounts of pepsin, pancreatin, bile, co-digested lipids and kinetic energy and gastric digestion time were modified, and WPI at concentrations equivalent to 0/25/50% of the protein recommended dietary allowance (approx. 60 g/d) were added to beta-carotene dissolved in oil. WPI enhanced bioaccessibility by up to 20% (p < 0.001), especially under higher simulated peristalsis or reduced amount of dietary lipids. Conversely, they impaired bioaccessibility to one third (p < 0.001) under incomplete digestive conditions. WPI modulated beta-carotene bioaccessibility depending on digestive conditions.

AB The berries from the native Chilean Gaultheria phillyreifolia and G. poeppigii are appreciated for their sweet taste and aroma. Fruits from both species were investigated for their secondary metabolite composition and antioxidant activity. The extracts were submitted to membrane chromatography to separate anthocyanins from copigments. Four anthocyanins were isolated by counter-current chromatography (CCC) and identified as cyanidin galactoside, cyanidin arabinoside, delphinidin galactoside and delphinidin arabinoside. From the copigments, CCC allowed the separation of quercetin(Q)-3-arabinoside, Q-3-rutinoside Q-3-rhamnoside and 3-caffeoylquinic acid. Additionally, the iridoids monotropein-10-trans-coumarate, monotropein-10-trans-cinnamate and 6 alpha-hydroxy-dihydromonotropein-10-trans-cinnamate were isolated. The latter two iridoids are reported here for the first time. Some 34 other compounds were tentatively identified by HPLC-DAD-ESI-MSn. The antioxidant activity showed differences between anthocyanins and copigments from both species. Main compounds were quantified and submitted to a Partial-Least Square Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA). This is the first report on the isolation of phytochemicals from the selected Chilean Gaultheria species.

AB In this study, a positively charged quaternized curdlan (Qcurd) was used to fabricate polyelectrolyte complex nanoparticles (PEC NPs) with a negatively charged pectin via electrostatic complexation. Results showed that the Qcurd/pectin PEC NPs prepared with 0.5 mg/mL Qcurd and pectin solutions, 1:2 pectin/Qcurd mass ratio, and pH 4.0 in the absence of NaC1 were characterized by a spherical morphology in nanoscale, an average particle size of 68 nm, and good dispersibility in aqueous solutions. Curcumin was encapsulated in the Qcurd/pectin PEC NPs through hydrogen bonding with an encapsulation efficiency of similar to 82%, a loading content of 13%, and a pH-dependent controlled release. Curcumin-loaded PEC NPs exhibited a significantly enhanced water solubility, excellent free radical scavenging ability and antioxidant capacity in vitro as compared with those of free curcumin.

AB Analytical parameters were determined for the first time in honey produced in the honeycomb constructed on comb foundations adulterated with 90% of paraffin (PF-H) and compared to honey ripened in genuine beeswax (BWF-H) using physico-chemical and spectroscopic techniques (H-1 NMR, FTIR-ATR, HS-SPME/GC-MS). Water content was significantly higher (SH) and glucose/water ratio significantly lower in PF-H samples. The contents of acetic and citric acid were marginally significantly higher (MSH) in PF-H samples. These findings suggest that adulterated beeswax affects composition of honey as the set of altered parameters indicate chemical changes leaning towards fermentative processes. Moderately changed headspace chemical profile of PF-H honey was determined depending on the floral source (pentanal, alpha-pinene and benzaldehyde were SH in BWF-H sunflower honey; butanal was MSH, and 2-phenylethanol was more abundant in BWF-H black locust honey). Higher percentage of nonanal, octane and beta-damascenone were found in PF-H samples that could indicate more intensive oxidation.

AB The influence of homogenization conditions on selected essential oil (thyme, lemongrass, cinnamon, peppermint, and clove)-in-water nanoemulsion formation and stability was investigated. Physically stable essential oil nanoemulsions could be fabricated by a microfludizer under optimized processing conditions (10,000 psi and 2 passes). The chemical compositions of EOs was characterized using GC-MS. The antifungal activity and mycotoxin inhibitory activity of essential oils in both bulk and nanoemulsion forms were determined using two isolates of Fusarium graminearum. The major chemical components of essential oil had a remarkable impact on long term physical stability, antifungal activity, and inhibition of mycotoxin production. With regard to inhibition of mycotoxin production, the mycotoxin inhibitory activity of essential oils was enhanced considerably in nanoemulsion form, which was attributed to greater solubility of the essential oils. It was also noted that the same essential oils exhibited significant differences in inhibition of mycotoxin production in the two isolates of F. graminearum.

AB Camelid alpha-lactalbumin is the only known protein that can undergo nonenzymatic deamidation on two Asn residues. This leads to the generation of a mixture of unusual isoAsp and D-Asp residues that may impact health. The effect of deamidation on camel alpha-lactalbumin instability was investigated. Circular dichroism showed that the altered protein acquired secondary structure resulting in an increase in alpha-helix content. In good agreement, the 3D structure of camel alpha-lactalbumin determined by X-ray crystallography, displayed a short additional alpha-helix probably induced by deamidation, compared to the human and bovine counterparts. This alpha-helix was located in the C-terminal region and included residues 101-106. Differential scanning calorimetry together with the susceptibility to thermolysin showed that the deamidation process reinforced the structural stability of the alpha-lactalbumin at high temperature and its resistance toward proteolysis.

AB Synchrotron Fourier transform infrared (S-FTIR) microspectroscopy allows the label-free examination of material microstructure but has not been widely applied to dairy products. Here, S-FTIR microspectroscopy was applied to observe the microstructure of Mozzarella cheese and assess the protein and lipid distribution within individual cheese blocks. High lipid and high protein areas were identified in transmission and attenuated total reflectance (ATR) analysis modes and the secondary structures of cheese proteins determined. Hierarchical cluster analysis and principal component analysis identified variation in random coil, water content, lipid carbonyl and methylene stretching across the sampled area. Similar spectral features were obtained in both analysis modes; spatial resolution was higher with ATR and small differences were noted, potentially as a result of differences in sample preparation. S-FTIR is a useful microscopy tool that can detect structural alterations that may affect product properties and may assist reverse engineering of a range of dairy products.

AB The glycation of silver carp myosin (Ms) with konjac oligo-glucomannan (KOG) of different degrees of deacetylation (DD) was investigated. As DD increased, the physico-chemical and functional properties of glycoconjugates changed. The available lysine content decreased, while grafting degree and total sulfhydryl group increased, and meanwhile, the isoelectric point (pI) reduced. SDS-PAGE analysis indicated that glycation can be promoted as the increase of DD. The solubility increased significantly both in 0.1 M and 0.5 M NaCl solution, and the thermal stability increased when heated for 60 min at 80 degrees C. The emulsifying activity index (EAI) and emulsifying stability index (ESI) increased as well. These results showed that the highly deacetylated KOG (DKOG) was easier to glycate with myosin, leading to a great improvement in functional properties of myosin. It can be suggested that the reduction in steric hindrance of DKOG as a result of removal of acetyl groups facilitated the glycation.

AB This review summarizes the effects of heating, acidification, high pressure treatment and enzymatic modification on coagulation (acid or rennet) behavior of casein micelles. Heating improves acid coagulation of casein micelles while it impairs rennet coagulation. Acidification results in the dissociation of colloidal calcium phosphate (CCP) and facilitates rennet-induced casein aggregation. Partial-rennet treatment of casein micelles improves acid gelation and leads to the formation of acid gels with higher elastic modulus and strength. Transglutaminase (TG) treatment increases casein micelle integrity and forms acid gels with homogeneous network and increased water holding capacity (WHC). TG treatment before renneting prohibits rennet coagulation while TG treatment following renneting produces gels with improved elastic modulus and WHC. The disintegration of casein micelles during high pressure treatment favors rennet coagulation while whey protein denaturation hinders coagulation. In contrast, high pressure treatment favors acid gelation, resulting in the formation of gels with increased rigidity and strength.

AB A novel and sensitive deep eutectic solvent-based matrix solid phase dispersion (DES-MSPD) method for the determination of aflatoxins (AFB1, AFB2, AFG1, AFG2) in various crops was established using high-performance liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection (HPLC-FLD). The DES-MSPD sample preparation procedure was optimized. Based on the optimal conditions, the intra-day and inter-day variability for AFs in all crop samples was less than 7.5%. Linearity was observed with R-2 values ( > 0.994). Using the present method, HPLC-FLD gave the limits of detection (LODs) of 0.03-0.10 mu g/kg and the limits of quantification (LOQs) of 0.10-0.33 mu g/kg for AFs. This work represents the first attempt of using DESs as a green extraction medium for the extraction of AFs in MSPD. Compared with conventional MSPD methods, the DES-MSPD procedure looks promising as a relatively simple and low cost process to build an assay that can be used for monitoring concentrations of AFs in crops.

AB Transglutaminase is an effective enzyme that catalyzes the crosslinking of various meats, improves meat product quality, and is widely used in the meat industry. In this study, microbial transglutaminase (MTG) was expressed successfully in Pichia pastoris strain GS115, and the enzyme activity was approximately 0.70 U/ml. The recombinant MTG expressed in P. pastoris was used in the investigation of restructured pork and crosslinking of soy protein isolate (SPI) and chicken myofibrillar protein (MP). Results showed that the hardness, chewiness, and F1 of the restructured pork increased, and the adhesiveness decreased after MTG treatment, However, high temperature had greater effect on the texture of restructured pork after MTG treatment than that of the control. MTG can crosslink SPI component acidic subunits, subunits of beta-conglycinin and MP component myosin heavy chain, and actin. MTG, as a food additive, can be successfully heterologously expressed, and the recombinant MTG has potential application in restructured meat products.

The changes in drying rate, polyphenol oxidase, peroxidase, and beta-carotene contents as well as antioxidant activity and colour in pre-treatment and hot air-dried apricot samples were investigated. PEF and heat treatments increased the drying rate of apricots. PEF treatments had no effect on the PPO activity and decreased the POD activity (p < 0.05). HPEF2 treatment retained more beta-carotene, higher antioxidant activity and suffered less browning during processing. Overall, the results indicate that combining sulphite treatment with PEF produces dried apricots with more beta-carotene and antioxidant activity, and better colour.

AB Inorganic arsenic is a well-known carcinogen associated with several types of cancer, but the mechanisms involved in arsenic-induced carcinogenesis are not fully understood. Recent evidence points to epigenetic dysregulation as an important mechanism in this process; however, the effects of epigenetic alterations in gene expression have not been explored in depth. Using microarray data and applying a multivariate clustering analysis in a Gaussian mixture model, we describe the alterations in DNA methylation around the promoter region and the impact on gene expression in HaCaT cells during the transformation process caused by chronic exposure to arsenic. Using this clustering approach, the genes were grouped according to their methylation and expression status in the epigenetic landscape, and the changes that occurred during the cellular transformation were identified adequately. Thus, we present a valuable method for identifying epigenomic dysregulation.

AB Nephrolithiasis is a complex disease in which its pathophysiology is strongly influenced by genetics. Polymorphisms of the vitamin D receptor (VDR) gene have been reported to be associated with the development of kidney stones which in most cases are composed predominantly of calcium salts. For the purpose of this study, we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to analyze the association of BsmI (rs1544410), ApaI (rs7975232), TaqI (rs731236) and FokI (rs2228570) polymorphisms with nephrolithiasis. A systematic search was performed up to June 2018 using PubMed, Embase and ISI Web of Knowledge databases. The keywords used for the search were "vitamin D receptor or VDR" and "polymorphisms or SNPs" combined with "urolithiasis or nephrolithiasis". A meta-analysis was performed with the results of the selected and included studies. After analyzing 23 publications, we observed that BsmI polymorphism (rs1544410) has a protective association against nephrolithiasis (Allelic model: OR = 0.84, CI 95% 0.73-0.96, Z p-value 0.015; homozygous model: OR = 0.72, CI 95% 0.54-0.97, Z p-value 0.033). Furthermore, we observed that FokI polymorphism (rs2228570) has a decreased risk of nephrolithiasis in the heterozygous model in the presence of heterogeneity (OR = 0.69, CI 95% 0.48-0.99, Z p-value 0.044), as well as in the absence of heterogeneity (OR = 0.81, CI 95% 0.66-0.99, Z p-value 0.045). Additionally, TaqI polymorphism (rs731236) was associated with a decreased risk of nephrolithiasis in the heterozygous model (OR = 0.77, CI 95% 0.63-0.94, Z p-value 0.010), and no overall association was observed with ApaI polymorphism (rs7975232). This meta-analysis provided comprehensive evidence that VDR polymorphisms are associated with upper urinary tract stones incidence and the genetic variants we studied provide protection against nephrolithiasis.

AB The marine dinoflagellate Alexandrium minutum is known to produce saxitoxins that cause paralytic shellfish poisoning in human worldwide through consumption of the contaminated shellfish mollusks. Despite numerous studies on the growth physiology and saxitoxin production of this species, the knowledge on the molecular basis of nutrient uptakes in relation to toxin production in this species is limited. In this study, relative expressions of the high-affinity transporter genes of nitrate, ammonium, and phosphate (AmNrt2, AmAmt1 and AmPiPT1) and the assimilation genes, nitrate reductase (AmNas), glutamine synthase (AmGSIII) and carbamoyl phosphate synthase (AmCPSII) from A. minutum were studied in batch clonal culture condition with two nitrogen sources (nitrate: NO3- or ammonium: NH4+) under different N:P ratios (high-P: N:P of 14 and 16, and low-P: N:P of 155). The expression of AmAmt1 was suppressed in excess NH4+-grown condition but was not observed in AmNrt2 and AmNas. Expressions of AmAmt1, AmNrt2, AmNas, AmGSIII, AmCPSII, and AmPiPT1 were high in P-deficient condition, showing that A. minutum is likely to take up nutrients for growth under P-stress condition. Conversely, relative expression of AmCPSII was incongruent with cell growth, but was well correlated with toxin quota, suggesting that the gene might involve in arginine metabolism and related toxin production pathway. The expression of AmGSIII is found coincided with higher toxin production and is believed to involve in mechanism to detoxify the cells from excess ammonium stress. The gene regulation observed in this study has provided better insights into the ecophysiology of A. minutum in relation to its adaptive strategies in unfavorable environments.

AB Background & objectives: Vaginal atrophy is characterized by thinning of vaginal epithelial layers and decreased local blood flow. We aimed to evaluate the regenerative effects of Adipose derived mesenchymal stem cells (ADMSC) and Bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMDSC) on vaginal atrophy in rat menopause model.
   Materials and methods: Rats were randomly divided into 4 (four) groups: sham, control, ADMSC, BMDSC. Vaginal epithelial thickness, structure of the lamina propria, blood vessels in the lamina propria, collagen deposition, and muscle structure were evaluated. Anti ER alpha, VEGF, VEGFR 1, Bax and bcl-2 antibodies were analyzed. Beta actin gene was used as endogenous control. Genetical differences among the groups were compared by using Kruskal Wallis and Mann Whitney U test. p < 0.05 was regarded as statistically significant.
   Results: Epithelial thickness of ADMSC group was higher than control group, but less than sham group Epithelial thickness of BMDSC group was less than sham group. Lamina propria and muscle tissue of ADMSC and BMDSC groups were found to be similar to sham group. VEGFR-1, VEGF, Bax and ER-a staining levels were higher in ADMSC and BMDSC groups than control group. ADMSC group stained stronger with VEGFR-1 and VEGF than BMDSC group. Bcl-2 staining level was increased in ADMSC applied group. No statistically significant difference was detected in Bax and Bcl-2 genes and Bax-/Bcl-2 ratio.
   Conclusions: Although genetic expression might have ended and could not be significantly demonstrated, histological and immunohistochemical results favor ADMSC application in vaginal atrophy rather than BMDSC.

AB The MnSOD Alal6Val single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) has shown to be associated to inflammatory pathways and many metabolic disorders, such as obesity and dyslipidemia. Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is an emergent problem among patients with epilepsy. However, little is known about interaction between MnSOD Alal6Val SNP and metabolic comorbities in epilepsy. Thus, we investigated the relationship between MnSOD Alal6Val SNP with epilepsy and its influence on MetS, inflammation, apoptosis and DNA damage parameters. Ninety subjects were evaluated (47 epilepsy patients and 43 healthy controls) by questionnaires and laboratorial exams. Levels of inflammatory, apoptotic and DNA damage markers, as well as MnSOD polymorphism were assessed. An increased proportion of VV genotype in epilepsy group when compared to control group was observed. Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), Acetylcholinesterase, caspase-8, and Picogreen levels were increased in VV epilepsy group. An important correlation between TNF-alpha vs caspase-8, and Cholesterol vs. Triglycerides was observed in the epilepsy group with VV genotype. Our findings suggest that the MnSOD Alal6Val SNP might have an important role in epilepsy, mainly in patients with generalized seizures and particularly with VV genotype. The metabolic parameters also presented significant results in epilepsy group with VV genotype, which applying attention in view of further consequences and disorders that could be developed.

AB Both SMAD4 and miR-126* have been proven to be involved in granulosa cell (GC) apoptosis and even follicular atresia, through commonly regulating follicle-stimulating hormone receptor (FSHR), the FSH-specific transmembrane receptor of GCs. However, the regulatory relationship between them in GCs is still unknown. In this study, we report that SMAD4 suppresses the expression of miR-126* and impairs its function in GCs of the porcine ovary by acting as a transcription factor. A classic SMAD4-binding element (SBE) site was found in the promoter of miR-126* by using in silico methods. Luciferase assay, qRT-PCR, and ChIP assay proved that SMAD4 serves as a transcriptional repressor and directly binds to SBE site within miR-126* gene promoter, which further reduces miR-126* gene expression and inhibits its transcriptional activity in GCs. Furthermore, SMAD4 also controls miR-126*-mediated expression of FSHR (a direct target of miR-126* in GCs). In addition, we prove that SMAD4 induces CYP19A1 expression (encodes aromatase, the key enzyme for oestrogen biosynthesis) and inhibits GC apoptosis through the miR-126*/FSHR axis. Taken together, our findings not only established a direct link between SMAD4 and miRNA-126*, two key factors of GC apoptosis, but also revealed an important way in which the SMAD4 regulates GC function, the miRNA-126*/FSHR axis.

AB In the work, metagenomic sequencing was conducted to investigate the microbial gene catalogue in two samples of phosphinothricin (PPT)-utilized soils from South China. The gene sets contained an overwhelming majority of prevalent microbial genes, and were largely shared between these two samples. Several genus with high abundance were shared, such as norank_d_Bacteria, Nitrososphaera, Candidatus_Nitrosotalea, Candidatus_Nitrosocosmicus, and Rhodanobacter. Bacitracin resistance genes (61.4%) were the most dominant antibiotic resistance genes in two samples, followed by multidrug resistance efflux pump (12.5%). A lot of common virulence factors with high abundance were found in two samples, such as Alginate, Capsule I, ClpC, FbpABC, and HitABC, many of which were used for the iron uptake system. Total 57 putative PPT acetyltransferase were annotated, and two of them were found to be novel putative acetyltransferases for acetylation and detoxification of PPT. In conclusion, the work revealed microbial gene catalogue of PPT-utilized soils and found two novel putative PPT acetyltransferases using metagenomics. The work facilitates the understanding of impact of PPT on complex microbial community structure and physiology resides in PPT-utilized soils. Moreover, two annotated PPT acetyltransferases show important potential for the development of transgenic herbicide -resistant crops.

AB Background: Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) include the nuclear receptor superfamily of ligand-activated transcription factors involved in several metabolic processes, including carbohydrate and lipid metabolism.
   Material and methods: In this study we examined PPARA: rs4253778, rs1800206, PPARD: rs2267668, rs2016520, rs1053049, PPARG rs1801282 and PPARGC1A rs8192678 polymorphisms in patients with unstable angina.
   This study included 246 patients with unstable angina confirmed by coronary angiography (defined by >70% stenosis in at least one major coronary artery) and 189 healthy controls.
   Results: We observed statistically significant difference in distribution of PPARG rs1801282 genotypes and alleles between patients and control group. Among patients there was the increased frequency of CG and GG genotypes and G alleles. The association between PPARG rs1801282 G allele and unstable angina was confirmed in multivariate regression analysis. There were no statistically significant differences in the distributions of other studied polymorphisms between patients with unstable angina and the control group.
   Conclusions: The results of our study suggest the association between PPARG rs1801282 G allele and unstable angina in Polish population.

AB Ets-1 is one of the crucial member of transcription factor family which share a unique DNA binding domain. It is predominantly expressed in various tumor subtypes and has shown its association in the regulation of various important genes which include ECM-degrading proteases. Our study aimed to understand the mechanism(s) in the pathogenesis of breast carcinogenesis by Ets-1 transcription factor and its downstream target gene MMP-9. Role of Ets-1 in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells was studied by RNA-interference in combination with pull down and ChIP assays to identify the regulation of MMP-9 in these cell lines. Our results showed that transfection of Ets-1 siRNA in breast cancer cell lines resulted in downregulation of Ets-1 and MMP-9. Ets-1 knock down also showed reduced cell invasion and altered expression of EMT markers. Moreover, we could also predict that MMP-9 gene promoter harbors a binding site for Ets-1 transcription factor may be responsible in direct transactivation of Ets-1 along with EMT markers. Phenotypic changes and molecular alterations that may result in increased aggressiveness/ invasiveness and metastatic nature of cancerous cells may lead to changes in EMT markers. Therefore, these findings may suggest a plausible role of Ets-1 dependent regulation of MMP-9 gene and may have a significant impact on breast carcinogenesis.

AB Background and purpose: The pathogenesis of endometrial cancer (EC) involves many regulatory pathways including transcriptional regulatory networks supported by transcription factors and microRNAs only in part known. The aim of this retrospective study was to explore the possible correlation in the EC microenvironment between master regulators of complex phenomena such as steroid responsiveness through estrogen receptor alpha (ER alpha) and progesterone receptor (PR), epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (supported by SLUG transcription factor), hypoxia (with hypoxia inducible factor-1 alpha, HIF-1 alpha), and obesity that has been recognized as a EC risk factor.
   Methods: Formalin-Fixed Paraffin-Embedded (FFPE) blocks from University of Ferrara Pathology Archive were used and allocated into 2 groups according to their immunohistochemical positivity to ER alpha and PR, distinguishing the samples with a more benign prognosis (ER alpha(+)/PR+) from those with a poorer prognosis (ER alpha(-)/PR-). Immunohistochemistry for HIF1-alpha and SLUG was also performed. Body mass index (BMI) was registered at the time of diagnosis: patients with BMI >= 30 kg/m(2) were defined obese (OB). Total RNA was isolated for miR-221 analysis.
   Results: We showed a comparable percentage of HIF1-alpha and SLUG positive samples in the ER alpha(+)/PR+ and ER alpha(-)/PR- groups. However, the obesity factor impacted more in the ER alpha(+)/PR+ group since the ratio between OB and non-obese (NOB) patients with high expression of HIF1-a and SLUG was higher in ER alpha(+)/PR+ than in the ER alpha(-)/PR- group. miR-221 levels were significantly higher in the OB than NOB patients, and, also in this case, obesity impacted more in the ER alpha(+)/PR+ group.
   Conclusions: A molecular circuit of mutual regulation between ER alpha, PR, HIF1-alpha, SLUG and miR-221 is feasible in the EC and was firstly suggested by our research. In this interplay miR-221 seems to be in a nodal point of the regulatory system that is particularly strengthened by the metabolic changes in obesity.

AB Phytopathogenic fungi secrete a wide range of enzymes to penetrate and colonize host tissues. Of them protease activity is reported to increase disease aggressiveness in the plant. With the aim to explore the reason of the higher infection potential of proteases, we have compared several genomic and proteomic attributes among different hydrolytic enzymes coded by five pathogenic fungal species which are the potent infectious agents of plant. Categorizing the enzymes into four major groups, namely protease, lipase, amylase and cell-wall degraders, we observed that proteases are evolutionary more conserved, have higher expression levels, contain more hydrophobic buried residues, short linear motifs and post-translational modified (PTM) sites than the other three groups of enzymes. Again, comparing these features of protease between pathogenic and non-pathogenic Aspergillus sps, we have hypothesized that protein structural properties could play significant roles in imposing infection potency to the fungal proteases.

AB The incidence of atherosclerosis is greatly increased, which becomes the leading cause for the death and disability worldwide. Endothelial cells dysfunction plays a substantial role in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. MicroRNA-148a-3p (miR-148a-3p) and circular RNA 0003575 (circ_0003575) modulated lipid metabolism and proliferative function of endothelial cells, respectively. However, the role of them in modulation of endothelial cell function and progression of atherosclerosis remains unknown. Endothelial cells were isolated from the aorta of Apoe(-/-) mice. miR-148a-3p in atherosclerosis patients and healthy controls were measured by qRT-PCR. Overexpression and knockdown of miR-148a-3p in endothelial cells were established. The proliferation, migration and apoptosis of endothelial cells were measured by MTT, Transwell, and fluorescence microscope, respectively. Online software (miRWalk 2.0 and RegRNA2.0) and databases (miRWalk, miRanda, RNA22, and Targetscan) were used to predict potential target genes of miR-148a-3p and circ_0003575. The expression of target genes was detected through western blotting. The expression of miR-148a-3p was significantly upregulated in patients with atherosclerosis as relative to healthy people. Overexpression of miR-148a-3p exhibited stimulatory effects on endothelial cell proliferation and migration and inhibited programmed cell death. Six intersection target genes, c-MAF, FOXO4, FOXO3, MITF, ETV7, and CRX, were predicted between miR-148a-3p and circ_0003575. The opposite effects of circ_0003575 and miR-148a-3p on the expression of FOXO4 and FOXO3, which are essential for lipid metabolism. We demonstrate that miR-148a-3p suppresses FOXO4 and FOXO3 expression via interruption of circ_0003575 function, which in turn impairs the proliferative and migratory function of endothelial cells, eventually exacerbating the atherosclerosis.

AB More than 2300 genes have been reported to be involved in spermatogenesis but the functional roles of most genes in male fertility remain to be elucidated. In this study, we explored the function of dipeptidase 3 (Dpep3), a gene predicted to be testis-specific, in male fertility of mice. We showed that Dpep3 is evolutionarily conserved in human and mouse along with other eutherians. Its mRNA was exclusively detected in testicular tissue and expressed in testes from 7 days postpartum. To further explore its role in male fertility, we generated Dpep3 knockout mice (Dpep3(-/-)) using the CRISPR/Cas9 technology and found that the male Dpep3(-/-) mice are fertile despite a significant reduction in sperm count. Histology of testis and progression of meiotic prophase I showed no obvious difference between wild-type and Dpep3(-/-) mice. All these findings indicate that Dpep3 is not essential for male fertility in mice. These findings will help other researchers to avoid research duplication, save their time and resources to focus on the genes that are indispensable for male fertility.

AB Sirtuin 1 is one of the regulators of cell growth and survival and its inhibition is suggested as a suitable mechanism to overcome breast cancer development. In this study we explored the role of miR-211-5p in SIRT1/p53 pathway and its influence on breast cancer cell viability and apoptosis. Cells were transfected with miR-211-5p mimic and inhibitor to modulate cellular miR-211-5p levels in breast cancer cell lines, MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7. Gene expression of miR-211-5p and SIRT1 were measured with real-time PCR. SIRT1 protein level and the acetylation of p53 as well as SIRT1 activity were evaluated by Western blotting and fluorometry, respectively. In order to explore the direct attachment of miR-211-5p to the 3'-UTR of SIRT1 mRNA, luciferase reporter assay was applied. Cell viability in response to miR-211-5p was studied by MTT assay and apoptosis was assessed by annexin V labeling followed by flow cytometry. Results showed that SIRT1 gene and protein expression were inhibited by miR-211-5p and the 3'-UTR of SIRT1 was found to be directly targeted by miR-211-5p. Inhibition of SIRT1 expression resulted in its reduced activity. Up-regulation of miR-211-5p was also followed by a significant decline in the acetylation status of p53 which was associated with remarkable decreased cell viability and induction of apoptosis in breast cancer cells. Antisense oligonucleotide of miR-211-5p acted as its inhibitor and exerted opposite effects both on SIRT1 expression and cell apoptosis. In conclusion, inhibition of SIRT1 by miR-211-5p could effectively reduce breast cancer cell survival and cause cell death and therefore might be considered a seemly mechanism for designing anticancer therapies.

AB As a transcriptional repressor, Chromobox 8 (CBX8) overexpression is found to be associated with tumorigenesis in several cancers. However, its role in radiotherapy resistance remains poorly characterized. Our study is the first to explore the correlation between CBX8 and radioresistance. We report here that CBX8 is upregulated in Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma (ESCC) tissues and cells and serves as an indicator of poor prognosis for ESCC patients. CBX8 knockdown inhibits cell proliferation, colony formation capability, DNA repair and promotes cell apoptosis. Moreover, the transcriptome sequencing analysis demonstrates that CBX8 downregulates the expression of Apoptotic protease activating factor 1 (APAF1), which is the core protein that mediates mitochondrial apoptotic pathways. APAF1 depletion could abrogate apoptosis induced by CBX8 knockdown in irradiated ESCC cells. Our results provide novel insight into CBX8 as a therapeutic target to improve the radiosensitivity of ESCC.

AB Tea plant (Camellia sinensis) is an important leaf-type woody crop used to produce non-alcoholic beverages all over the world. Tea is one of the oldest and most popular non-alcoholic beverages in the world, and long-term tea drinking has numerous healthful for humans due to many of the important secondary metabolites, such as polyphenols and theanine. Theanine and polyphenols are also closely related to tea flavor and tea aroma, which is usually as the standard for judging tea quality. The growth of tea plants and quality of teas are susceptible to adversity abiotic and biotic stresses, such as low temperatures and pests. Consequently, this review focus on the research progress of key genes related to the stress resistance and material metabolism of tea plants in recent years. We aim at comprehensively understanding the growth and metabolism of tea plants and their relationship with the external environment, so as to provide an in-depth and broad theoretical support for the breeding of excellent tea plant varieties.

AB Hexokinase (HXK) is a multifunctional protein that serves as a sugar sensor for glucose signaling and a catalyst for glycolysis. It has been well studied in many species, however, there is far less information about this family in pear. To investigate the roles of HXK in the growth and development of pear fruit, we performed a genome-wide analysis and identified the HXK gene family members in pear. In addition, we functionally characterized a glucose sensor gene, PbHXK1, in P. bretschneideri. In total, 10 HXK genes were identified in pear, and a multiple sequence alignment and phylogenetic analysis showed that PbHXK1 is a Type B HXK that contains four conserved domains, phosphate 1 and 2, sugar binding and adenosine, which are specific to plant HXKs and essential for enzymatic functions. A qRT-PCR analysis revealed that the relative expression levels of PbHXK1 were negatively correlated with sugar content but significantly positively correlated with HXK activity during pear fruit development. Furthermore, the overexpression of PbHXK1 in tomatoes significantly enhanced the HXK activity and decreased the sugar content. In addition, the growth of transgenic tomato plants overexpressing PbHXK1 was inhibited, leading to shortened internodes and smaller leaves. Thus, in pear, PbHXK1 encodes HXK, which regulated the sugar content in fruit and affected the growth and development of plants.

AB A novel beta-1,3-glucanase from Arca inflata was purified using chromatography methods. It was determined as a glycoprotein comprising 23.65% carbohydrate content with O-linked glycan and showed specific activity of 90.01 +/- 1.2 U/mg against laminarin. The optimal pH and temperature for the activity of the glucanase were 6.0 and 40 degrees C, respectively. The affinity parameter of the glucanase using laminarin was determined as K-d = 13.09 mu M. The activity of the glucanase was 27 +/- 2.6% enhanced by 2-mM Mn2+ ions and inhibited by 40-50% using 2-mM Zn2+, Cu2+, or Ba2+ ions. The glucanase showed an endo-type cleavage mode and hydrolyzed laminarin into glucoses, disaccharides, trioligosaccharides, and tetraoligosaccharides. Otherwise, the glucanase exhibited immune-enhancing effects via significantly increasing the phagocytic activity of macrophages and inducing the release of nitric oxide, tumor necrosis factor a, and interleukin-6 in RAW264.7 cells. It might be used as a bifunctional additive for the food industry.

AB A rapid on-line non-chromatographic hydride generation atomic fluorescence spectrometry is described and determination of inorganic arsenic (iAs (III) and iAs (V)) species is achieved within a single run. Thioglycolic acid (TGA) was used for on-line pre-reduction of iAs (V) and quantification of arsenic species was accomplished via calibration with one As form; as iAs (III). Samples and calibration standards were prepared in Tris buffer (pH:7.2) for selective hydride generation and without on-line pre-reduction, iAs (V) signal was negligible up to 150 ng ml(-1). The limit of detection (LOD) values for iAs (III) and iAs (V) were 27 pg ml(-1) and 36 pg ml(-1) respectively. Recovery studies were performed, certified reference material (TMDA-61) was used to test the accuracy of the method and the results were in good agreement iAs (V) was the main form in all water samples whereas iAs (III) concentration was < LOD value for some samples.

AB The interactions between flavors (hexyl acetate [HxAc], heptyl acetate [HpAc], linalyl formate [LiFo], linalyl acetate [LiAc], geraniol, linalool, limonene and myrcene) and soy protein isolate (SPI) were investigated, the influence of flavors structure and preheated SPI (PSPI) were determined by using headspace solid-phase microextraction gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (HS-SPME/GC-MS) technology. For HxAc and HpAc, the binding of SPI and the flavors decreased in the order nature > 80 degrees C > 90 degrees C > 100 degrees C PSPI, for LiFo, LiAc, geraniol, and linalool, nature < 80 degrees C < 90 degrees C < 100 degrees C PSPI. For limonene and myrcene, an increase in headspace concentration or "salting out" effect was noticed. The NSPI (nature SPI) and PSPI of 80 degrees C showed two class binding sites for HxAc and HpAc. These results serve as a foundation for further investigation into the effect of preheating of SPI on its ability to bind to flavor-inducing compounds.

AB To explore the effect of signal acquisition way on screening ability, the multiplexing fiber optic laser induced fluorescence spectroscopy (LIFS) system with one-, two- and three-probe, were employed respectively to detect artificially aflatoxin B-1 (AFB(1), 5, 10, 20, 30, and 50 ppb) contaminated 300 pistachio kernels in this study. Compared to one- and two-probe modes, highest accuracy (>= 97.0%) by support vector machine (SVM) employing 390-660 nm were obtained using three-probe, which also showed the most attractive precision (root mean square error of prediction (RMSEP) < 4.5 ppb) for AFB(1) by stepwise multiple linear regression (SMLR) using 174-1100 nm. These suggested that the effective collection of spatial information could improve the performance of model, and the three-probe LIFS had a preliminary feasibility for discriminating pistachios contaminated with low concentration of AFB(1). Further study on classifying naturally contaminated samples is needed to validate the applicability of this system.

AB The flavor fingerprint of Tricholoma matsutake Singer was developed and volatile compounds were investigated by HS-GC-IMS fingerprinting combining with PCA. A total of 25 typical target compounds were identified. The differences of flavor compounds in pileus and stipe of Tricholoma matsutake Singer from different areas were observed. After drying, the concentration of C8 compounds, including 3-octanone, 3-octanol, 1-octen-3-one and 1-octanol, decreased, while the concentration of methanol and 1-pentanol increased. Subsequently, PCA was performed based on the signal intensity of the identified violate compounds, and the results clearly showed that the samples in a relatively independent space would be well distinguished. Combining the signal intensity of the identified violate compounds by HS-GC-IMS and PCA, the samples from different portions of Tricholoma matsutake Singer and different areas were distinguished. The results showed that the flavor fingerprint of Tricholoma matsutake Singer were established by HS-GC-IMS and PCA based on the identified volatile compounds.

AB Takifugu obscurus is famous for its delicious taste. In this study, three peptide fractions from Takifugu obscurus muscle hydrolysates were used to evaluate and compare physicochemical and sensory characteristics after Maillard reaction. Maillard reaction products (MRPs) were analyzed by detecting the changes of browning intensity, free amino acids, volatile compounds and taste profile. Results showed that intermediate flavor products in three fractions of MRPs from different molecular weight peptides were much stronger than in control groups. The free amino acids of MRPs from 0.3 to 3.0 kDa and whole fraction showed a similar trend. The contents of volatile compounds (furans, phenols, pyrazines and so on) also increased in the three MRP fractions. The taste characteristics of three fractions showed stronger kokumi effect and umami taste compared to their control groups. To sum up, this investigation lays the groundwork for the development of a flavoring agent from Takifugu obscurus.

AB The immobilization of cellulase on amine-functionalized Fe3O4 magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs), via metal affinity immobilization, as a nano-biocatalyst was investigated. Copper was chosen as ligand and loaded onto MNPs in a buffering environment without adding any intermediates. Immobilization conditions were optimized by a 2(3) full factorial design method. Under optimized working conditions (Cu/MNPs = 1, E/MNPs = 0.11, pH = 6), the relative enzyme activity and the amount of enzyme immobilization were 91% and 164 (mg enzyme/g MNPs), respectively. The immobilized cellulase (tested by carboxymethyl cellulose hydrolysis at 1% concentration) was found to be more stable than the free enzyme. Also, the immobilized enzyme still retained 73% of its initial activity after five cycles of usage. Furthermore, the free and immobilized cellulases retained 70 and 84% of their initial activity after eight days storage at 4 degrees C, respectively. Immobilization of enzymes, using this method, could be a good and economic option for various industries.

AB Using simple solvent extraction and enzymatic hydrolysis, a rapid LC-MS/MS method for quantification of free and conjugated forms of anthocyanidins and anthocyanins in plasma and urine samples was developed and validated. A mixed enzymatic treatment containing beta-glucuronidase (100 U mL(-1)) and sulfatase (2.5 U mL(-)(1)) for 5 min (37 degrees C; pH 6) was optimal condition for deconjugation of anthocyanidins and anthocyanins in urine and plasma samples. The LC-MS/MS allowed quantifying thirteen different anthocyanidins and anthocyanins simultaneously. The developed LC-MS/MS method was precise and accurate over multiple days and nominal concentrations. The stability assessment study confirmed that the long-term storage and/or periodic use of plasma and urine samples might have a considerable impact on the stability of some anthocyanidins. The method was successfully applied to measure anthocyanidins and anthocyanins in plasma and urine samples following consumption of acute blueberry test meals.

   PERFORMANCE
AB The effect of kneading on dough microstructure development, dough elongation and bread volume was investigated using wheat flour with a high mechanical starch modification (MSM) level. The resistance to extension (R-max) of dough produced from wheat flour with a high MSM level increased by 52.5% because of higher protein network connectivity with prolonged kneading time. The improved network structure was caused by an increased protein branching rate ( + 14.8%), a decreased protein end-point rate ( - 24.3%) and a decreased mean lacunarity ( - 64%). R-max was highly correlated with specific bread volume (r = 0.97, P < 0.05) only if the dough was not over-kneaded. Kneading time adaptation of the dough produced from high MSM flour significantly increased specific bread volume by 24.4%. Differences compared with the standard can be attributed to weakened network connectivity because of weakened protein interfacial interactions and larger cavities within the gluten network, both caused by starch swelling.

AB Diverse interferences often affect the determination of pesticide residues in various kinds of food, and complex pretreatments are necessary. An effective approach for the simultaneous quantitative analysis of multi-target components in different substrates was proposed, and applied to the determination of ternary pesticides in cherry tomatoes and red grape samples. By means of HPLC-DAD, the spectra were obtained under isocratic elution. Utilizing the Tchebichef image moments, unified quantitative models were established for the three target components in the samples with two different substrates, respectively. The correlation coefficients of leave-one-out cross-validation (R-loo-cv(2)) of the obtained models were more than 0.9975. The predictive correlation coefficients (R-P(2)) were more than 0.9831. Compared with the N-PLS and MCR-ALS methods, the proposed approach is not only more accurate and reliable, but also can extract essential information and expected to be a potential tool to rapidly quantify multi-component in different substrates without complex pretreatments.

AB This work focusses on the effects of cold plasma, a novel, non-thermal technology, on the quality of blueberry juice, such as inactivation of Bacillus, anthocyanins, phenolics, vitamin C, antioxidant activity and color change. Oxygen concentration (0, 0.5% and 1%) of ionized gas was firstly confirmed to be the main factors for CP treatment, besides treatment time (2, 4 and 6 min). The increment of treatment time and oxygen concentration significantly promoted an increasing trend of death for Bacillus. Compared with thermal treatment, the content of phenolics was significantly increased by CP treatment, and also CP treatment could better keep the original color of blueberry juice. In terms of anthocyanin and vitamin C, relatively shorter exposure time to CP was more suggested. In antioxidant tests, increment of oxygen concentration resulted in the increasing trends of antioxidant activity in DPPH and ABTS assays.

AB The cultivation of Crocus sativus L. is valued for its dried stigmas, but the rest of the parts of its flowers are increasingly important. Saffron flowers (SF) are natural sources of antioxidant compounds. Kaempferols and anthocyanins are the main compounds of the high-phenolic content of SF. This work studies the evolution of flavonols and anthocyanins of dry SF and floral bio-residues of saffron (FBR) and their kinetics at different temperatures and relative humidity (RH) conditions. There was a degradation process of anthocyanins that fitted a second-order kinetic model and kaempferols showed better fit in a first-order kinetics model. The best storage conditions for anthocyanins studied in SF and FBR was 25 degrees C and 23% RH. The main kaempferol (Kaempferol 3-O-sophoroside) was no deteriorated in FBR. These results could contribute to the using SF and FBR as food and active ingredients in cosmetic industry, as well as development of new food products.

AB Here, we present an ultra-sensitive visual biosensor based on thermostatic triple step functional nucleic acid cascade amplification for detecting Zn2+. A Zn2+-assisted cDNAzyme assay is conducted and the Zn2+ is successfully converted into nucleic acids to achieve the first circular amplification within 1 h. The cleavage products prompted Hybridization Chain Reaction (HCR), forming multiple DNA nanowire structures with branched chains. And the Strand Displacement Amplification (SDA) were further empowered by the HCR products with the addition of the amplification enzyme and the endonuclease. In just 80 min, the second and third-order signal amplifications are reached. With the addition of Hemin and chromogenic substrates, the visual signal output is achieved in 15 min based on the large amount of G-quadruplex (G4) DNAzymes. This biosensor can detect levels as low as 1.075 pM Zn2+, showing a good linear range within 10 pM-100 nM. It shows considerable potential for the Zn2+ quantitative detection.

AB Due to the potential toxicity of sulfite as widely used food additive, there is urgent need for the development of low-cost, rapid and convenient sensors for sulfite detection. Toward this end, highly sensitive and selective sulfite sensors based on solution gated graphene transistors (SGGTs) was innovatively developed. The performance of the device was significantly improved through the functionalization of the gate electrode with multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs). We found that the MWCNT modified SGGT sensor showed an ultra-low detection limit of 30 nM toward sulfite. In addition, we also demonstrated that the SGGT-based sulfite sensor was capable of detecting sulfite content in practical liquor samples with high recovery rate. Considering its low-cost and easy-fabricating features, we believe that the SGGT-based sensor with appropriate functionalization may be applied as a highly potential platform for ultra-sensitive detection of a broad range of important analyzes in practical samples for food safety purpose.

AB The difference of metabolite profiles between raw and cooked pufferfish (Takifugu flavidus) meat was explored by H-1 NMR technique and multivariate statistical methods. The orthogonal projection to latent structure-discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) results showed an obvious separation between two samples. There were 24 dominating metabolites in the pufferfish muscle extraction, of which 11 metabolites changed significantly (p < 0.05), including 9 amino acids (alanine, leucine, methionine, tyrosine, glutamate, glycine, arginine, lysine, taurine), 1 organic acid (lactate) and 1 alkaloid (betaine). Moreover, the Student's t-test was performed to identify the different levels of metabolites. Sensory intensity experiments showed that there was a significant difference in the umami taste between raw and cooked pufferfish meat (p < 0.05). The content of glutamate, aspartate and 5'-IMP in the cooked meat increased, making the umami taste more intense. This study provided essential information about the metabolites explaining the taste difference between raw and cooked pufferfish meat.

AB This study was undertaken to estimate the concentrations of the formed polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in heat-treated (boiled, pan-fried and grilled) meats collected from Egypt. Dietary intakes and cancer risks of PAHs among Egyptian adults were calculated. Benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P)-induced mutagenicity and oxidative stress in human colon (CaCo-2) cell line and mechanisms behind such effects were also investigated. Finally, protection trials using rosmarinic (RMA) and ascorbic acids (ASA) were carried out. The results indicated formation of PAHs at high levels in the heat-treated meats. Calculated incremental life time cancer risk among Egyptian adults were 7.05179E - 07, 7.00604 E - 06 and 1.86069 E - 05 due to ingestion of boiled, panfried and grilled meats, respectively. B[a]P-exposed CaCo-2 cells had high abilities for mutagenicity (490.05 +/- 21.37 His + revertants) and production of reactive oxygen species.

AB To unravel prospective lactic acid bacteria (LAB) and yeasts with potential application in potato-based products, the microbial diversity of fermented potato was studied. High-throughput sequencing revealed that the 5 samples differ in microbial compositions resulting from nutrients modification by the pretreatment methods adopted. Weisella and Saccharomyces cerevisiae were found to be the dominant LAB and yeast in fermented potato respectively. The high abundance of Weisella (35.84%) and Gluconobacter (20.80%) in steamed fermented potato (SFP) resulted in lowering of pH (4.39 +/- 0.09) and inhibition of undesirable bacteria and fungi. Fermentation increased protein and dietary fiber contents of boiled fermented potato (BFP) and SFP, with highest protein content (8.18 +/- 0.22%) recorded in BFP. The dietary fiber contents of BFP and SFP are 9.68 +/- 0.68% and 9.48 +/- 0.37% respectively with no observable significant difference. This study provides information on microorganisms with potential benefits in quality enhancement of potato-based products.

AB A colorimetric hydrogen sulfide (H2S) sensor based on gellan gum capped silver nanoparticles was developed to real-time monitor meat spoilage. The colorimetric sensor strategy was attributed to the ultrastrong binding ability of Ag with H2S to form Ag2S. The sensor enables the analysis of H2S with a limit of detection (LOD) of 0.81 mu M, and it exhibited excellent selectivity toward H2S against other volatile components generated from chicken breast and silver carp during spoilage. By these virtues, the sensor presented visible color changes from yellow to colorless by in situ and nondestructively sensing H2S generated from chicken breast and silver carp in a packaging system. This strategy provided a simple but useful, non-destructive, robust, cost-effective, and userfriendly platform to real time monitor meat spoilage for intelligent food packaging.

AB Guavas are tropical climacteric fruit with a short postharvest shelf life at room temperature. This study aims to extend the shelf life of red guavas 'Pedro Sato' using edible coatings of hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC) and beeswax (BW) at concentrations of 10%, 20%, and 40% (dry basis). Coated and uncoated guavas were stored for 8 days at 21 degrees C and assessed every 2 days. The HPMC + BW produced a modified atmosphere around the fruit, delaying ripening process. The coatings reduced loss of mass, maintained green color, and increased firmness compared to the control fruit. The uncoated fruit had 6 days of shelf life. The treatment with HPMC + 20% BW provided the best maintenance of fruit quality. On the eighth day, fruit with this coating showed the same physicochemical characteristics of control fruit in the second day of storage, which represents a gain of 6 days in the shelf life of guavas 'Pedro Sato'.

AB Apple juice spoilage by Zygosaccharomyces rouxii could scarcely be identified at early stage. It is crucial to recognize the spoilage at early stage to prevent waste of products. In present study, electronic tongue was applied to detect the spoilage of Z. rouxii in apple juice, using taste evaluation by panelists as reference. Combined with linear discriminant analysis, identification of the contaminated juice was fulfilled after 12 h, equivalent to yeast population of less than 2.0 lg colony forming units/mL. At the level, panelists were not capable of discerning the spoilage. Sensors HA, ZZ, BB and BA were relatively more sensitive to the changes in overall taste of apple juice. Moreover, cell number of Z. rouxii could be properly quantified by partial least squares regression models with high determination coefficient of 0.98-0.99. Electronic tongue appears to be a powerful approach to realize early detection of contamination of Z. rouxii.

AB A comprehensive characterization of commercial green tea (CGT) with the employment of independent variables such as low molecular weight carbohydrates (LMWC), soluble solids, color and antioxidant capacity has been performed in this manuscript.
   Within the manuscript, a convenient HILIC-MS method, suitable to perform a simultaneous identification and quantification of all mono-, di-, oligosaccharides and cyclitols observed in green tea was introduced. The method covers all key analytes in a single chromatographic analysis.
   Fifty-six samples from different origins (n = 10) were evaluated to explore differences based on origin. In addition, commercial samples processed by pan-firing and steaming were used for comparative purposes, allowing the identification of putative processing markers.
   The results obtained contribute to gain a better knowledge of the variations, according to origin and processing, in composition and quality of CGT, commodity widely appreciated by the consumers.

AB Total phenolic chromatographic indices (TPCI) of three commercially grown saskatoon berry varieties and a pomace from commercial juice production were determined. Northline was shown to have the highest TPCI of 504.2 mg/100 g FW. These results agreed with total phenolic content results for these varieties. The TPCI of the commercial pomace was 404.2 mg/100 g pomace indicating that a significant concentration of phenolics were present in this co-product, showing the commercial relevance of this material. A phenolic rich extract (PRE; 500 ppm) of the Northline variety was compared to BHT (0.02% w:w) and Rosamox (0.2% w:w) for delaying the oxidation of borage oil via rancimat analysis. Induction times were 1.46 h (borage oil), 1.44 h (Rosamox), 2.18 h (BHT), and 2.42 h (PRE), which was a similar to 65% delay in the oxidation of borage oil. These results clearly support the value of this material as an antioxidant ingredient in foods, pharmaceuticals, nutriceuticals and cosmetics.

AB The determination of cochineal (E-120) in strawberry jam was carried out in the presence of carmoisine (E-122) using the four-way PARAFAC decomposition and excitation-emission fluorescence matrices. In the measured conditions, there was no fluorescence signal for carmoisine due to a strong quenching effect and this colorant also led to a decrease of the fluorescence signal of cochineal. The European Union has fixed a maximum residue level, MRL, for cochineal in jam (100 mg kg(-1)). Therefore, the addition of other food colorant (carmoisine) in the jam could lead to false compliant decisions. The four-way PARAFAC decomposition avoided false compliant decisions caused by the quenching effect.
   Cochineal was unequivocally identified. Detection capability (CC beta) was 0.72 mg L-1 for probabilities of false positive and false negative fixed at 0.05. Cochineal was detected in the jam (104.63 mg kg(-1)) above the MRL. This amount was compared with the one obtained using a HPLC/DAD method.

It is an important precursor compound in Strecker reactionism that directly leads to known beer aging indicators and can influence the final sensory beer quality. However, the conditions of 3-DG formation in the malting process have not yet been described.
   To investigate the reaction pathways of 3-DG formation, we varied the composition of reactants (sugars, amino acids) by using different malting modification levels (germination time 5-7 d; steeping degree 42-45%; germination temperature 12-14 degrees C); final kilning temperature (60 degrees C to 100 degrees C).
   After its derivatization with ortho-phenylenediamine, we analyzed 3-DG with HPLC-UV. 3-DG concentration was between 5 and 120 mu mol/100 g dry weight. The formation of 3-DG increased for high malt modification levels and high final kilning temperature.
   The abundant formation of 3-DG in the malting process is already comparable to the occurred brewing process concentration.

   using microbial transglutaminase

AB The aim of our study was to improve the texture quality of salted Alaska pollock (Theragra chalcogramma) roe product using microbial transglutaminase (MTGase). Thus, the effect of 0-1.0% MTGase on the physical properties of the salted roe was assessed. Endogenous TGase activity in the roe, which contributes to improving its texture, decreased at -20 degrees C during frozen storage. Mechanical properties of the salted roe, such as roe firmness and egg breaking strength, were improved using MTGase, the optimum concentration of which was 0.5%. Protein polymerizations using SDS-PAGE and decreasing of protein solubilities in SDS-urea solution were observed in the salted roe with MTGase. Therefore, the texture of salted Alaska pollock roe can be significantly enhanced by adding 0.5% MTGase because of catalyzing protein crosslinking. Additionally, this study most likely indicates that MTGase can be used to improve the texture of aquatic processed foods at low temperatures, especially 5 degrees C.

AB Cross breeding may create wider genetic variation than two parents used in hybridization, but breeding efforts towards starch quality improvement are less reported in potato. A cross was made between Zhongshu-3 and Favorita to select desired starch properties in progenies. Among 206 F-1 clones with potential high yield, starch qualifies such as apparent amylose content (AAC), pasting viscosity, and thermal properties were further evaluated. A wide variation was observed in different starch physicochemical indices for 206 potato accessions. Twenty clones with high/low AAC, peak viscosity and peak gelatinization temperature were selected and then grown at another location to evaluate the stability of the traits. Similar wide range of variation in the starch properties was observed. Cluster analysis based on starch properties of the 20 selected clones indicating relative stability of the starch property traits across different locations. New breeding lines identified have potential for application in food and other industries.

AB Acetaldehyde is a major wine oxidation product. Here, three Cabernet Sauvignon wines, containing different levels of acetaldehyde from different micro-oxygenation (mOx) regimes, including yeast-mediated treatments, were aged under closures differing in oxygen ingress. Oxygen, phenolics, carbonyls and heterocyclic acetals were measured. Acetaldehyde levels at bottling was a significant factor in the phenolic compound profile after one year, with anthocyanins most affected, then flavonols, flavonoids and hydroxycinnamic acids, but there were negligible effects on benzoic acids. The effect of bottle closures with increased oxygen ingress had a similar trend. Increased acetaldehyde levels and oxygen ingress also yielded higher levels of the heterocyclic acetals from glycerol. These changes reflect aging, and suggest that managing mOx during production could be used to reduce the time needed to achieve some aged wine characteristics.

AB Blueberry is one of the richest phenolic sources, providing health benefits. To study blueberry phenolic biosynthesis, we investigated phenolics and proteomics at three typical fruit maturation phases. Multiple isoforms of enzymes and multiple members of transcription factors involved in phenolic biosynthesis were divergent and differently regulated. Regulation of some proteins resulted in change of phenolic content. During fruit maturation, down-regulation of VcOMT (CUFF.177.1) and VcLAR2 (CUFF.16780.1) was associated with decreases of ferulic acid and catechin, respectively; Up-regulation of VcFLS (CUFF.41155.1), and VcF3'5'H (CUFF.51711.1) and VcF3'5'H (gene.g10884.t1.1) likely drove increases of their products (quercetin and myricetin); Up-regulation of VcUFGALT (CUFF.20951.1) and VcUFGT73 (4333_g.1) and down-regulation of VcU5GT (CUFF.51258.1) were correlated to accumulation of anthocyanins with 3-glucoside/galactoside. Additionally, four TFs, VcAPRR2 (CUFF.24826.1), VcbHLH3 (CUFF.37765.1), VcWD (CUFF.28282.2) and VcWD (CUFF.28273.1) were probably related to regulation of anthocyanin biosynthesis. These proteins were potential targets for genetic improvement in a breeding program.

AB Free radical imbalance is associated with several chronic diseases. However, recent controversies have put in check the validity of colorimetric methods to screen the functionality of polyphenols. Therefore, in this study two antioxidant methods, based on chemical reactions, were tested for their ability in anticipating the reduction of the activation of NF-kappa 3 using LPS-activated RAW 264.7 macrophages, selected as a biological model. Grape processing by-products from winemaking showed higher total phenolic content (TPC), antioxidant capacity towards peroxyl radical (31.1%) as well as reducing power (39.5%) than those of grape juice by-products. The same trend was observed when these samples were tested against LPS-activated RAW 264.7 macrophages by reducing the activation NF-kappa B. Feedstocks containing higher TPC and corresponding ORAC and FRAP results translated to higher reduction in the activation of NF-kappa 3 (36.5%). Therefore, this contribution demonstrates that colorimetric methods are still important screening tools owing their simplicity and widespread application.

AB Portulaca oleracea L. (Purslane) has great potential as food and traditional drugs in several countries. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the anti-inflammatory effects of purslane extract on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)stimulated RAW 264.7 cells. Purslane extracts significantly reduced LPS-induced synthesis of NO in a dose-dependent manner, as well as the expression levels of iNOS and COX-2. The productions of TNF-alpha and IL-6 were also significantly reduced at the higher dose of 400 mu g/ml. Meanwhile, the expression levels of P65, p-P65, p-MEK and p-I kappa B-alpha were inhibited dose-dependently. The nuclear translocation of P65 was partially prevented by the extract, which explained the inhibition of NF-kappa B pathway. In addition, three reported flavonoids, named luteolin, kaempferol and quercitrin, were identified in the extract, which might be responsible for its anti-inflammatory effects. Above all, our research has partially proved that purslane could be considered as a natural anti-inflammatory agent in further applications.

AB Whether caseinate oligochitosan-glycation of the transglutaminase-type followed by trypsin digestion could lead to better protection against the acrylamide-induced cell barrier damage was investigated. Compared with caseinate digest, glycated caseinate digest had similar amount of Lys and Arg but lower -NH2 (0.557 versus 0.508 mol/kg protein) and total amide (1.12 versus 1.05 mol/kg protein) contents, and contained glucosamine at 5.74 g/kg protein. Acrylamide damaged barrier function of IEC-6 cells efficiently, leading to increased para-cellular permeability and lactate dehydrogenase release, decreased trans-epithelial electrical resistance, and destroyed tight junction. The two digests alleviated these barrier dysfunctions via reversing index values. Three cellular proteins (ZO-1, occludin, and claudin-1) crucial to tight junction were up-regulated by the two digests. Furthermore, glycated caseinate digest was always more effective than caseinate digest to improve cell barrier function. This oligochitosan glycation is thus desired, as it ensures glycated protein digest with higher potential to protect intestinal barrier function.

AB Two small Lagocephalus sceleratus juveniles were captured in picarel targeting catches from North Aegean Sea (Greece) in the autumn of 2017. An electrochemical immunosensing tool using magnetic beads as immobilisation support was developed and applied to the rapid screening of tetrodotoxins (TTXs), potent neurotoxins that constitute a food safety hazard when present in seafood. This tool revealed the presence of TTXs in both individuals. Results were compared with those provided by mELISA and LC-HAMS, the latter confirming the presence of TTX. Some of the tissues contained TTX contents close to or above 2 mg/kg. L. sceleratus juveniles had been considered as non-toxic and, to our knowledge, this is the first report of high TTX levels in small L. sceleratus individuals. Such specimens can be mistaken with other edible species, posing a threat to consumers. The availability of low-cost and user-friendly tools for TTXs detection will contribute to guarantee seafood safety.

AB Blue mould caused by Penicillium expansum is one of the important diseases of apple fruit during storage. Phenylpropanoid pathway is an important induction mechanism that can utilize downstream metabolites of shikimate pathway to synthesize a series of secondary metabolites. Apple fruit (cv. Fuji) were treated with sodium nitroprusside (SNP) to study its effect on blue mould, shikimate and phenylpropanoid pathways. The results showed that 1.0 mmol L-1 SNP significantly inhibited lesion development of apple fruit inoculated with P. expansum. The results also indicated that SNP enhanced MdDHQS, MdSKDH, MdSK and MdEPSPS genes expressions, increased shikimic acid, tryptophan, tyrosine and phenylalanine contents in apple fruit. The activities of phenylalanine ammonialyase, 4-coumarate: coenzyme A, ligase, cinnamate 4-hydroxylase, lignin, total phenolic compounds and flavonoids contents in apple fruit were also increased by SNP treatment. These results suggest that SNP might modulate shikimate and phenylpropanoid pathways to enhance disease resistance of apple fruit.

AB Cronobacter sakazakii can cause life-threatening infections in neonates. Exposure to contaminated powdered food, especially milk powder, is a major route for C. sakazakii infection. Cold atmospheric plasma (CAP) is well known as a non-thermal method for inactivating microbial pathogens. This study evaluates the effectiveness of CAP on C. sakazakii in non-fat dry milk (NFDM) powder using a fluidized reaction system. The CAP treatments for 20-120s led to 1.17-3.27 log(10) reductions of C. sakazakii. C. sakazakii inactivation increased with increasing flow rate from 8 to 20 L/min. In terms of quality attributes of NFDM after the CAP treatments, no noticeable color changes (Delta E < 1.5) were observed. Moreover, no significant changes in crystallinity, amino acid composition, or phenolic content occurred following a 120s-CAP treatment. These results indicate that this fluidized reaction system combined with CAP can provide an effective antimicrobial activity with minimal effects on some physicochemical properties of NFDM powder.

AB Fluorescein-isothiocyanate (FITC) labeled trypsin-like protease was prepared and injected into the hepatopancreas of white shrimp. Different segments of the injected shrimp were analyzed with a fluorescence microscope during storage. FITC-trypsin-like protease can be detected in the first segment of shrimp muscle at day 4, while it cannot be observed in the second segment until day 6. The results showed that trypsin-like protease can migrate from hepatopancreas to the tail portion. Texture profile analysis showed that soybean trypsin inhibitor retarded the softening of the shrimp muscle. The rheological results revealed that the content of myosin heavy chain (MHC) in shrimp muscle was decreased with the extended storage time. Proteomics analysis displayed that trypsin-like protease accelerated the metabolism of postmortem muscle. It can be concluded that trypsin-like protease migrated from the hepatopancreas to the muscle tissue, degraded myofibrillar protein, deteriorated the muscle texture, and eventually leaded to the softening of white shrimp.

AB The aim of this study is to shed light on the evolution of the minor compounds in the corn oil oxidation process, through the information provided by direct immersion-microextraction in solid phase followed by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (DI-SPME-GC/MS). This methodology enables one, in a single run, to establish the identity and abundance both of original oil minor components, some with antioxidant capacity, and of other compounds coming from both main and minor oil components oxidation. For the first time, some of the compounds formed from oil minor components degradation are proposed as new markers of oil incipient oxidation. Although the study refers to corn oil, the methodology can be applied to any other edible oil and constitutes a new approach to characterizing the oxidation state of edible oils.

AB To test the potential of different analytical tools to determine the geographical origin of Ethiopian coffee, 103 green arabica coffee samples from four coffee regions in Ethiopia were subjected to multi-elements and delta C-13, delta N-1(5) and delta O-18 determinations. Multi-elements were determined by using inductively coupled plasma (ICP)- and X-ray fluorescence spectrometry (XRF)-based techniques, and delta C-13, delta N-1(5) and delta O-18 were determined by using elemental analyzer-isotope ratio mass spectrometry. Using linear discriminant analysis, XRF-based multi-elements with and without delta C-13 appeared to be most effective in discriminating the geographical origin of coffee, giving higher classification accuracy (89 and 86%, respectively) than ICP-based multi-elements with and without stable isotopes (80%, each). These results demonstrate the potential of XRF-based multi-element profiling as a relatively fast and low-cost tool to trace the geographical origin of Ethiopian coffee. All together this study offers the proof of concept for a promising method that, upon standardization, could be used for coffee provenance authentication and fraud detection.

AB To provide precision management of cucumber under protected cultivation, the relationships between environmental factors and daily increment of aroma in two lines were analyzed during development, using Pearson correlation and stepwise regression. Irrespective of the line tested, the daily increment of volatile compounds and C6 aldehydes were positively correlated with average daily light intensity (X-1), while the daily increment of C9 aldehydes was negatively correlated with average daily relative humidity (X-4) and average daytime relative humidity (X-7). X-1 was considered as the most significant environmental factor which affected the daily increment of volatile compounds in both lines, X-7 was the environmental factor which affected the daily increment of C9 aldehydes most in No.14-1, and X-1 and X-4 were the factors which affected the daily increment of C6 aldehydes and C9 aldehydes most in No.26. A range of environmental factors was forecast for the maximal daily increment of volatile compounds.

AB The oxidative stability of Echium oil has been studied by two accelerated oxidation methodologies namely Rancimat and differential scanning calorimetry at selected temperatures in the range 50-110 degrees C. Kinetic analyses have provided Arrhenius parameters, oxidative stability indexes (OSI), temperature coefficients (t(coef)), Q(10) and OSI at 20 degrees C (OSI20) for both methodologies focussing on secondary and tertiary oxidation products. Peroxide, panisidine and polar compounds values have been measured to characterize from primary to tertiary oxidation products. In general, susceptibility of this oil to oxidation has been found to be larger than for other vegetable oils, according to the OSI20 values estimated by Rancimat and differential scanning calorimetry. However, the values of t coeff and Q(10 )are found to be similar to those described for vegetable oils. In addition, a study of the influence of two antioxidants, namely hydroxytyrosol and rosemary extract on the oxidative stability of Echium oil has been carried out using both methodologies. Protective effects over oxidation by up to a threefold increase of OSI20 values have been found for both antioxidants at the highest dose utilized.

AB The first licensed dengue vaccine, CYD-TDV (Dengvaxia) is efficacious in seropositive individuals, but increases the risk for severe dengue in seronegative persons about two years after administration of the first dose. For countries considering the introduction of Dengvaxia, WHO recommends a pre-vaccination screening strategy whereby only persons with evidence of a past dengue infection would be vaccinated. Policy-makers need to consider the risk-benefit of vaccination strategies based on such screening tests, the optimal age to introduce the vaccine, communication and implementation strategies. To address these questions, the Global Dengue and Aedes-transmitted diseases Consortium (GDAC) organized a 3-day workshop in January 2019 with country representatives from Asia and Latin America.
   The meeting discussions highlighted many challenges in introducing Dengvaxia, in terms of screening test characteristics, costs of such tests combined with a 3-dose schedule, logistics, achieving high coverage rates, vaccine confidence and communication; more challenges than for any other vaccine introduction programme. A screening test would require a high specificity to minimize individual risk, and at the same time high sensitivity to maximize individual and population benefit. The underlying seroprevalence dependent positive predictive value is the best indicator for an acceptable safety profile of a pre-vaccination screening strategy. The working groups discussed many possible implementation strategies. Addressing the bottlenecks in school-based vaccine introduction for Dengvaxia will also benefit other vaccines such as HPV and booster doses for tetanus and pertussis. Levels of public trust are highly variable and context specific, and understanding of population perceptions and concerns is essential to tailor interventions, monitor and mitigate risks.

AB The study aimed to investigate the impact of 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) immunization on the overall pneumococcal disease in children in Taiwan by surveillance of culture-confirmed pneumococcal disease (CCPD). This study was conducted in a medical center from 2012 to 2016. Clinical isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae were prospectively collected from pediatric patients. Serotyping, multi-locus sequence typing, and antimicrobial susceptibility testing were performed. A total of 473 patients with CCPD, including 58 with invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD), were identified. The incidence of CCPD per 10,000 admissions decreased from 71.7 in 2012 to 27.0 in 2016. The proportion of additional PCV13 serotypes significantly decreased from 52.0% in 2012 to 21.7% in 2015 but increased slightly to 26.7% because of serotype 19A in 2016 (P < 0.0001). The proportion of non-vaccine serotypes (NVTs) increased significantly from 18.4% in 2012 to 66.7% in 2016, but the increase of the incidence of CCPD caused by NVTs was not considered significant (P = 0.0885). Genotyping identified predominant clones, ST63(15A), ST83(15B), and ST166/338(23A), for major NVTs. The penicillin non-susceptibility of PCV13 serotypes was significantly higher than that of NVTs (P < 0.0001). Surveillance of CCPD appears superior to IPD alone for evaluation of the overall impact of pneumococcal immunization. Serotype replacement occurred quickly after the use of PCV13, while the incidence of NVT infection did not show a significant increase in children over the years. The gradual introduction of PCV13 into national immunization program is effective in reducing overall pneumococcal disease in children. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background: In South Korea, the population is rapidly aging and the prevalence of comorbidities has increased. We investigated longitudinal changes in the herpes zoster (HZ) considering demographic changes and comorbidities in the era of universal single-dose varicella vaccination.
   Methods: We used the population-based database of the National Health Insurance Service in South Korea, with approximately 50 million subscribers during 2006-2015. HZ cases were identified using ICD-10 codes and comorbid conditions were also collected. Incidence rates (IRs) and incidence rate ratios (IRRs) per year were calculated adjusting for age, sex, comorbidities and socioeconomic status, and the temporal trends were examined using segmented negative binomial regression analysis.
   Results: Over a decade, the adjusted HZ IR increased significantly from 4.23 to 9.22 per 1000 person-years (adjusted IRR 1.05, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.04-1.06). However, during 2012-2015, the increasing trends decelerated (adjusted IRR per year 1.01, 95% CI 0.98-1.04) and slope changes differed by age. There was a declining trend in children under 9 years, sustained increase in adults aged 30-39 years, and near-plateau in those aged 50-69 years. Nonetheless, the age distribution of HZ incidence did not change over a decade, with the peak in adults aged 60-79 years. HZ-associated hospitalization rates also increased, with a deceleration in the increasing trends during 2012-2015.
   Conclusions: The HZ burden increased independently of demographic changes and prevalence of comorbidities. However, different trajectories by age group necessitate continuous HZ surveillance for better understanding of these changes, and to provide evidence for development of preventive strategies.

AB Objective: In response to the emergence of influenza viruses with pandemic potential, we evaluated a swine-origin influenza A/H3N2 variant (H3N2v) vaccine in children.
   Study design: This multicenter phase II open-label study assessed the safety and immunogenicity of two doses, 21 days apart, of investigational unadjuvanted subvirion monovalent inactivated H3N2v vaccine administered via intramuscular injection. Children 6-35 months of age received 7.5mcg or 15mcg of hemagglutinin (HA)/dose; children 3-17 years of age received 15mcg HA/dose. Safety and reactogenicity were assessed by measuring the occurrence of solicited injection site and systemic reactions in the 7 days after each vaccination; adverse events were assessed for 42 days and serious adverse events for 7 months after the first vaccination. Immunogenicity was evaluated by measuring hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) and neutralizing (Neut) antibodies to H3N2v prior to and 21 days after each vaccination. Cross-reactivity against seasonal H3N2 strains was evaluated.
   Results: The H3N2v vaccine was well tolerated. Transient mild to moderate injection site tenderness, pain and erythema was observed, with the most commonly reported systemic reactogenicity being irritability in children 6-35 months, and headache and fatigue in children 9-17 years old. Children 6-35 months old, whether they received 7.5mcg or 15mcg/dose, had low HAI and Neut antibody responses after two doses compared to older children. Children under 9 years of age required two doses of vaccine to demonstrate a response, while 9-17 year olds responded well after one dose. Previous influenza vaccination and older age were associated with higher immune responses to H3N2v vaccine. Children 9-17 years of age also developed cross-reactive antibodies against recent seasonal H3N2 influenza viruses.
   Conclusion: The H3N2v vaccine was safe and immunogenic in children and adolescents. Age-related increases in immunogenicity against H3N2v and seasonal H3N2 viruses were observed, suggesting prior priming via infection and/or immunization. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID MORTALITY
AB Influenza is a major medically attended respiratory illness. The impact of influenza on morbidity and mortality is particularly high in the elderly. Immunosenescence attenuates the immune response of influenza vaccine in the elderly. High-dose influenza vaccine contains 60 mu g of hemagglutinin per strain, four times more compared with standard-dose (SD) influenza vaccine. This study is a phase I clinical trial investigating the immunogenicity and safety of the GC3114, high-dose, quadrivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (HD-QIV) in healthy adults aged 19-64 years during the 2017-2018 season. Seroprotection rates of HD-QIV were 100.0% for A/H1N1, 96.67% for A/H3N2, 83.33% for B/Yamagata, and 96.67% for B/Victoria. Seroconversion rate for A/H1N1, A/H3N2, B/Yamagata, and B/Victoria strains were 86.67%, 90.0%, 53.33%, and 53.33%, respectively, in the HD-QIV group. The post-/pre-vaccination geometric mean titer ratio (GMTR) was 15.28 for A/H1N1, 8.19 for A/H3N2, 3.56 for B/Yamagata, and 3.03 for B/Victoria in the HD-QIV group. Seroconversion rate and post-/pre-vaccination GMTR for A/H3N2 were significantly higher in the HD-QIV group than in the SD-QIV group (control). No serious adverse events were reported. In conclusion, GC3114 was safe, well-tolerated, and immunogenic in healthy adults. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Vaccination offers the most cost-effective approach to limiting the adverse impact of infectious and neoplastic diseases that reduce the quality of life in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). However, it is unclear what vaccine vectors would be most readily implementable in the setting and at what age they should be applied for maximal efficacy. Adenoviruses (Ad) and Ad-based vectors have been demonstrated to induce effective humoral and cellular immune responses in animal models and in humans. However, because immunity associated with Ad infection is lifelong, there exists a debate as to whether pre-existing immunity might decrease the efficacy of Ad vectored vaccines. In order to begin to nationally develop vaccination strategies for SSA, we have quantified neutralizing antibodies (nAb) against Ad4, Ad5, Ad7, Ad26, Ad28, Ad45 and Ad48 in 67 adult women and their infants. We are the first to define the decay kinetics of transferred maternal nAb in infants as well as the apparent initiation of de novo Ad responses. Our findings demonstrate that in Zambian adults, robust nAb responses exist against each of the Ads tested and are efficiently transferred to newborns. With few exceptions, neither the HIV-1 infection status of the mothers or the antiretroviral therapy (ART) treatment of HIV-1 disease had significant impact on maternal Ad nAb responses or their transfer to infants. However, maternal Ad nAb decays in infants to a nadir at 12 months of age such that any of the seven Ad types could function as vaccine vectors. The definition of this 'window of opportunity' provides important foundational data for rational design and implementation of Ad vectors in this setting. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Measles cases have occurred in individuals with histories of vaccination against the disease in Zhejiang Province, China. The purposes of this study were to determine the seroprevalence of immunoglobulin G (IgG) measles antibodies in vaccinated individuals, to explore the waning kinetics of measles antibody among children after receipt of a measles-containing vaccine, and to define high-risk groups in the population. A seroprevalence survey of measles antibody was conducted with 1900 randomly selected and age-stratified participants aged 6-14 years in Zhejiang province. In our study, seronegative persons accounted for 7.17% of study participants. A case-control study of participants who had received at least one dose of measles-containing vaccine was conducted, with 123 cases of immune failure and 1593 controls with immune success. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that age, and number of doses were the influencing factors for measles immunization failure. The older a participant (odds ratio [OR] = 1.164), the more likely that measles vaccine immunity failed. In addition, immune failure was more likely to occur after one dose of MCV than two doses (OR = 0.008) or three doses and more (OR = 0.047). In a univariate logistic regression analysis, we found that immune failure was more likely to occur with MCV vaccination beginning at 8 months than at 9-11 months (OR = 0.562) and the subjects whose registration residence was in other cities in Zhejiang province (OR = 3.527). However, these differences in seropositivity were not significant in the multivariate logistic regression analysis. The exponential regression equation of the attenuation model after measles immunization was y = 884.64e(-0.057x) (R-2 = 0.0521, p < 0.001), and results showed that the measles geometric mean concentration of IgG antibodies was approximately 884.64 mIU/ml after the last MCV vaccination and decreased with time since last vaccination.

AB An ideal adjuvant should increase vaccine efficacy through balanced Th1/Th2 responses and be safe to use. Recombinant protein-based vaccines are usually formulated with aluminum (alum)-based adjuvants to ensure an adequate immune response. However, use of alum triggers a Th2-biased immune induction, and hence is not optimal. Although the adjuvanticity of RNA has been reported, a systematic and overall investigation on its efficacy is lacking. We found that single strand RNA (termed RNA adjuvant) derived from cricket paralysis virus intergenic region internal ribosome entry site induced the expression of various adjuvant-function-related genes, such as type 1 and 2 interferon (IFN) and toll-like receptor (TLR), T cell activation, and leukocyte chemotaxis in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells; furthermore, its innate and IFN transcriptome profile patterns were similar to those of a live-attenuated yellow fever vaccine. This suggests that protein-based vaccines formulated using RNA adjuvant function as live attenuated vaccines. Application of the RNA adjuvant in mouse enhanced the efficacy of Middle East respiratory syndrome spike protein, a protein-subunit vaccine and human papillomavirus L1 protein, a virus-like particle vaccine, by activating innate immune response through TLR7 and enhancing pAPC chemotaxis, leading to a balanced Th1/Th2 responses. Moreover, the combination of alum and the RNA adjuvant synergistically induced humoral and cellular immune responses and endowed long-term immunity. Therefore, RNA adjuvants have broad applicability and can be used with all conventional vaccines to improve vaccine efficacy qualitatively and quantitively. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Infectious bursal disease (IBD) is an acute, highly contagious immunosuppressive disease that affects young birds causing important economic losses in the poultry industry worldwide. Strict hygiene management together with effective vaccination programs are the most important strategies to prevent Infectious bursal disease virus entry in poultry production facilities. Hyperimmunisation of dams with inactivated vaccines just before the laying period provides passive immunity to the progeny that protects them during the critical first few weeks after hatching before vaccination with live attenuated virus takes place. In the present study, a safe and economic plant-based vaccine candidate against IBD intended for breeder hens was evaluated. We demonstrated that the recombinant immunogen is effective as booster for previously primed hens since it increases specific antibodies against VP2 that are transmitted to the offspring with titres and decay rate similar to those achieved by inactivated vaccine. Moreover, these maternally derived antibodies have virus neutralising activity and are able to confer protection against challenge in progeny, as evidenced by absence of bursal damage and low viral titres in this organ. Taking into account the disadvantages of inactivated vaccines as well as the benefits of plants as expression systems, such as time and cost efficiency, lower risk of contamination from animal pathogens and nearly unlimited scalability, a plant-based subunit IBD vaccine represents a viable alternative in the veterinary field.

AB Observational cohort studies in high-income settings have suggested that vaccination order may affect children's subsequent risk of a heterologous infection, with live vaccines reducing and inactivated vaccines (given on their own or with a live vaccine), increasing the risk. We used the self-controlled case-series method, which automatically controls for the individual level confounding to which such cohort studies are prone, to test this hypothesis. We compared the relative incidence (RI) of infections post-vaccination in two calendar periods in England; in Period 1 (September 2002-August 2006) live measles, mumps, rubella (MMR) vaccine was given on its own and in Period 2 (September 2006-April 2010) inactivated vaccines (7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV7) and sometimes the combined Haemophilus influenzae type b/meningococcal group C vaccine (Hib-MenC)) were given concomitantly with MMR. Admissions for an infection of the upper or lower respiratory tract, gastrointestinal system or other site in children aged 11-23 months were selected from the Hospital Episode Statistics database in England and linked to child health immunisation histories. The analysis included a total of 24,144 infections in 21,067 children in Period 1 and 36,880 in 31,616 children in Period 2. The RI of admission for any infection in Period I was 1.00 (95% confidence interval 0.95-1.06) compared with 0.95 (95% confidence interval 0.90-1.00) in Period 2. Comparing the two periods showed no evidence of a difference in the relative incidence estimates with a ratio of RI of 0.94 (95% confidence interval 0.87-1.02), RIs within 90 days of vaccination were 0,94 (0.91-0.97) in Period 1 and 0.94 (0.91-0.97) in Period 2, consistent with a temporary healthy vaccinee effect. In conclusion, we found no evidence to support the hypothesis that there is a reduction in heterologous infections after MMR on its own or an increase after MMR given concomitantly with an inactivated vaccine.

AB The process of obtaining informed consent for school-based adolescent immunisation provides an opportunity to engage families. However, the fact that parental consent needs to be obtained remotely adds complexity to the process and can have a detrimental effect on vaccine uptake. We conducted a multiple methods analysis to examine the practice of obtaining informed consent in adolescent immunisation programmes. This involved a thematic analysis of consent related data from 39 interviews with immunisation managers and providers collected as part of a 2017 service evaluation of the English adolescent girls' HPV vaccine programme and a descriptive statistical analysis of data from questions related to consent included in a 2017 survey of parents' and adolescents' attitudes to adolescent vaccination. The findings indicated that the non-return of consent forms was a significant logistical challenge for immunisation teams, and some were piloting opt-out consent mechanisms, increasing the proportion of adolescents consenting for their own immunisations, and introducing electronic consent. Communicating vaccine related information to parents and schools and managing uncertainties about obtaining adolescent self-consent for vaccination were the main practical challenges encountered. Survey data showed that parents and adolescents generally agreed on vaccine decisions although only 32% of parents discussed vaccination with their teenager. Parental awareness about the option for adolescents to self-consent for vaccination was limited and adolescents favoured leaving the decision-making to parents. From the interviews and variability of consent forms it was evident that health professionals were not always clear about the best way to manage the consent process. Some were also unfamiliar with self-consent processes and lacked confidence in assessing for 'Gillick competency'. Developing pathways and related interventions to improve the logistics and practice of consent in school-based adolescent immunisation programmes could help improve uptake. (C) 2019 The Author(s).

AB Background: Herpes zoster (HZ) is caused by reactivation of a latent varicella zoster virus (VZV). The potential to develop HZ increases with age due to waning of memory cell-mediated immunity (CMI), mainly the CD4 response. Therefore, VZV-CD4-memory T cells (CD4-M) count in blood could serve as a barometer for HZ protection. However, direct quantification of these cells is known to be difficult because they are few in number in the blood. We thus developed a method to measure the proliferation level of CD4-M cells responding to VZV antigen in whole blood culture.
   Methods: Blood samples were collected from 32 children (2-15 years old) with or without a history of varicella infection, 18 young adults (28-45 years old), and 80 elderly (50-86 years old) with a history of varicella infection. The elderly group was vaccinated, and blood samples were taken 2 months and 1 year after VZV vaccination. Then, 1 mL of blood was mixed with VZV, diluted 1/10 in medium, and cultured. CD4-M cells were identified and measured by flow cytometry.
   Results: There was distinct proliferation of CD3(+)CD4(high)CD45RA(-)RO(+) (CD4(high)-M) cells specific to VZV antigen at day 9. The majority of CD4(high)-M cells had the effector memory phenotype CCR7(-) and was granzyme B-positive. CD48(high)-M cells were detected in blood culture from varicella-immune but not varicella-non-immune children. Meanwhile, a higher level of CD4(high)-M proliferation was observed in young adults than in the elderly. The CD4(high)-M proliferation level was boosted 2 months after VZV vaccination and maintained for at least 1 year in the elderly.
   Conclusion: Quantifying VZV responder CD4(high)-M cell proliferation is a convenient way to measure VZV CMI using small blood volumes. Our method can be applied to measure VZV vaccine-induced CMI in the elderly. (C) 2019 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Objective: The recent Zika virus outbreak, while no longer an international public health emergency, is still a serious threat, particularly to pregnant women and babies born to pregnant women infected with the virus. This study examined the predictive effects of psychosocial constructs on self-reported intent to get a future Zika vaccine among women of reproductive age.
   Methods: Data were collected using an online survey with a representative sample of 339 women ages 18-49 from the continental United States. The survey addressed variables originating with the Extended Parallel Processing Model (EPPM) as related to future Zika vaccine uptake intent.
   Results: Three quarters of all respondents reported intention to get a future Zika vaccine. Path modeling revealed a direct effect of perceived susceptibility, self-efficacy, and response efficacy on future Zika vaccine uptake intent, as well as an indirect effect of perceived susceptibility through both self-efficacy and response efficacy. In addition, the final model showed an indirect effect of perceived severity on Zika vaccine uptake intent through self-efficacy and response efficacy and accounted for 54.6% of the variance in vaccination intent.
   Conclusions: These findings have implications for future Zika vaccine promotion campaigns.
   This study confirms the importance of perceived susceptibility, self-efficacy, and response efficacy for use in Zika vaccine uptake campaigns: in addition, when using perceived severity, both self-efficacy and response efficacy should be considered in message design.

AB Delay in vaccination from schedule has been frequently documented and varies by vaccine, dose, and setting. Vaccination delay may result in the failure to prevent deaths that would have been averted by on-schedule vaccination.
   We constructed a model to assess the impact of delay in vaccination with pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) on under-five mortality. The model accounted for the week of age-specific risk of pneumococcal mortality, direct effect of vaccination, and herd protection. For each model run, a cohort of children were exposed to the risk of mortality and protective effect of PCV for each week of age from birth to age five. The model was run with and without vaccination delay and difference in number of deaths averted was calculated. We applied the model to eight country-specific vaccination scenarios, reflecting variations in observed vaccination delay, PCV coverage, herd effect, mortality risk, and vaccination schedule. As PCV is currently being scaled up in India, we additionally evaluated the impact of vaccination delay in India under various delay scenarios and coverage levels.
   We found deaths averted by PCV with and without delay to be comparable in all of the country scenarios when accounting for herd protection. In India, the greatest relative difference in deaths averted was observed at low coverage levels and greatest absolute difference was observed around 60% vaccination coverage. Under moderate delay scenarios, vaccination delay had modest impact on deaths averted by PCV in India across levels of coverage or vaccination schedule. Without accounting for herd protection, vaccination delay resulted in much greater failure to avert deaths.
   Our model suggests that realistic vaccination delay has a minimal impact on the number of deaths averted by PCV when accounting for herd effect. High population coverage can largely over-ride the deleterious effect of vaccination delay through herd protection. (C) 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Background: In 2016, Australia introduced the "No Jab, No Pay" legislation, which removed the option of non-medical exemptions from the vaccination requirements to receive certain family and child care tax benefits. We aimed to gauge parental support for "No Jab, No Pay" and explore how it has impacted parental attitudes towards vaccination, particularly among families that are reliant on the tax benefits linked to vaccination under "No Jab, No Pay".
   Methods: An online survey distributed to parents with children under 5 in Australia assessed parental knowledge and opinions towards childhood vaccination and the "No Jab, No Pay" policy.
   Results: A total of 411 parents completed the survey. The majority of parents reported their child was either fully vaccinated or they intended to fully vaccinate. Eighty-two percent of parents were in favour of "No Jab, No Pay." The belief that vaccine-preventable diseases are a significant risk to unvaccinated children was a predictor of supporting the "No jab, No Pay" policy (AOR = 5.95, 95% CI = [3.60, 10.94], p < 0.001). Parents that depend on the financial benefits associated with "No jab, No Pay" and parents that utilize child care services were significantly more likely to reconsider vaccination, if they previously hesitated or objected, because of the policy (AOR = 9.66, 95% CI = [4.98, 18.72], p < 0.001 and AOR = 2.09, 95% CI = [1.04, 4.17], p = 0.04).
   Conclusion: We found that there is widespread support for "No Jab, No Pay" among parents of young children, but parents that depend on the financial benefits or utilize child care services may be disproportionately affected by the policy. Childhood vaccination coverage in Australia could best be improved by increasing access to vaccination services and by imposing significant administrative barriers to obtaining non-medical exemptions.

AB Objectives: Influenza vaccine is recommended in some chronic medical conditions, including several rare diseases. The objectives of the study were to assess the effect of text message reminders on influenza vaccination uptake of patients with selected rare diseases and delayed vaccination, and to describe their characteristics.
   Methods: Quasi-experimental pre-post intervention study performed along the 2016 influenza vaccination campaign in the Autonomous Community of Madrid. Unvaccinated patients diagnosed with a selected rare disease were targeted for intervention. SMS were sent to them at least one month after the beginning of the campaign, in four consecutive weeks. Those with no mobile phones available or no certainty of message reception, were assigned as controls. The association between the reception of the SMS and vaccination uptake was assessed using multiple poisson regression models.
   Results: Of 69.040 patients with delayed vaccination, 87.2% received an SMS reminder in the asigned contact mobile telephone. Global influenza vaccine coverage reached 41.3%. The uptake of influenza vaccine was significantly higher among those receiving the reminder (9.3% vs. 7.1% in the control group, p < 0.001). Those who received a SMS reminder were 30% more likely to uptake seasonal influenza vaccine. By sex and age, the reception of the reminder was associated with a significantly higher probability of vaccination in men >= 65 years with at least a concurrent chronic condition (IRR: 1.58, C195%: 1.25-2.00). Among women, this higher probability was detected in those between 14 and 64 years of age (IRR: 1.41, CI95%: 1.22-1.63), and >= 65 years without concurrent chronic conditions (IRR: 1.40, CI95%: 1.05-1.89).
   Conclusion: Although the intervention was modestly effective, it proved beneficial in some cases. It can be an additional strategy to improve vaccine uptake, since it is simple, feasible, affordable and easily scalable, particularly when immunization and target population data are available in population registries.

AB Background: The 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) has been commercially available in Brazil since 2010. We investigated the carriage prevalence, capsular types, and antimicrobial resistance among pneumococci isolated from children immunized with PCV13 in Brazil.
   Methods: We analyzed 500 children < 6 years old attending public (n = 270) and private (n = 230) clinics in Niteroi/Rj, Brazil, in 2014. We determined the antimicrobial susceptibility and capsular types for all isolates.
   Results: Thirty-eight (7.6%) of 500 children had received at least one PCV13 dose. Since only two (0.7%) of 270 children at the public clinic were vaccinated with PCV13, major analyses focused on 36 (15.7%) of 230 children attending private clinics. Nine (25%) of 36 children were pneumococcal carriers. Characteristics associated with carriage were age >= 2 years, cough/expectoration, and childcare center attendance (p <= 0.01). The capsular types found were 15B/C (n = 2), 6C, 11A/D, 16F, 23A, and 23F. Two isolates were non-typeable (NT). Three (33.3%) isolates were multidrug resistant. We found four (44.4%) penicillin non-susceptible pneumococci, with penicillin and ceftriaxone MICs ranging from 0.12 to 4.0 mu g/ml and 0.023-0.5 mu g/ml, respectively. We also detected two (22.2%) erythromycin resistant isolates (MICs of 3.0 and 256 mu g/ml).
   Conclusions: Colonization with PCV13 serotype was rare among the vaccinated children. Increasing PCV13 coverage might help reduce the frequency of major serotypes currently associated with invasive pneumococcal diseases in Brazil, such as 3 and 19A. The isolation of multidrug-resistant serotype 6C and NT isolates in carriage, however, requires close monitoring. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background: A vaccine manufacturer in China and regulatory authorities have been the focus of widespread outrage due to a vaccine scandal. We conducted a rapid survey during a time of intense mainstream and social media attention to determine whether the public's confidence in vaccines was affected.
   Methods: We selected 7 cities that were not involved in the scandal as the setting for the survey, which was conducted in August 2018. We used a convenience sampling strategy to select subjects in urban streets and rural villages for a face-to-face questionnaire-based survey. Subjects were asked to describe their levels of confidence on a scale from 0 to 9, in which 0 means no confidence, and 9 means very confident. Respondents were asked to assess confidence for two points in time - recollection of their level of confidence before hearing about the scandal and their level of confidence at the time of the survey.
   Results: In total, 683 individuals were invited to participate and 591 questionnaires were completed, for a response rate of 86.5%. Among respondents, 86.80% had heard of the vaccine scandal. The most common channel for hearing about the scandal was social media (e.g., WeChat), 40.6% of respondents. Regardless of gender, age, education level, province, town or country, or having children under 15 years old, respondents reported a significant decrease in confidence in domestically-produced vaccines. The mean pre-scandal confidence level recalled by respondents was 6.7, and the mean confidence level at the time of the survey was 3.2. Confidence in vaccine manufacturers, institutes for drug control, and drug supervision authorities decreased from 5.6 to 6.0 before the vaccine scandal to 2.0-3.2 at the time of the survey. Confidence in vaccine manufacturers decreased the most, from 5.6 before the scandal to 2.0; confidence in institutes for drug control decreased from 5.8 before the scandal to 2.6 at the time of the survey.
   Conclusion: This study demonstrated that public confidence was significantly affected by the vaccine scandal, particularly for vaccine producers and drug regulators. The decline in confidence is a reminder to governments that in order to build public confidence for vaccination, regulators have to reform regulatory practices and manufacturers have to ensure vaccine quality.

AB Influenza vaccines remain the most effective public health measure for the prevention of influenza related illnesses. The primary immunogen in inactivated influenza vaccines is hemagglutinin (HA), the receptor binding protein of influenza. The concentration of HA during vaccine production and testing is standardized according to the level of antigen as measured by Single Radial Immunodiffusion Assay (SRID). This allows vaccine potency to be controlled such that individuals receive a dose known to provoke a clinically protective immune response. As compared to alternatives, SRID has the advantage of quantifying immunologically relevant forms of HA, but it depends on timely generation of novel reagents for each new vaccine strain. In recent years, a number of alternative assays have been suggested based on either epitope recognition, receptor binding or protection from proteolysis but it is unclear how they relate to vaccine potency in clinical trials. In this report we describe the development of a lectin-based, ELISA-type assay for HA potency and find it provides similar potency estimates to SRID except in the case of a vaccine with aggregated HA and other viral proteins. In that case, SRID predicted the immunologically active HA present and ELISA techniques did not This difference was due to tested antibodies failing to pull down or bind to the HA present unless particle aggregates were first dissociated. Furthermore, detergent treatment alone was insufficient to complete this dissociation. While others have previously demonstrated that immunocapture-based techniques can misestimate the potency of influenza vaccines depending on the individual antibodies used we demonstrate that in this case the failure was due to an inability of all antibodies to capture HA contained in the aggregated influenza vaccine.
