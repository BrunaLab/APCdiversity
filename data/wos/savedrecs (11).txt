AB An update on pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease, the present document describes the crosstalk between autophagy and inflammation in Alzheimer's disease progression by assessing key findings and identifying gaps in the current knowledge. Inflammation mediators can disrupt the clearance of misfolded proteins. It is well defined that misfolded protein accumulation and aberrant level of inflammatory mediators in the brain can trigger Alzheimer's disease. Studies indicated that restoring the inflammatory and autophagy mediators improves Alzheimer's disease. This presents a problem: How inflammation interacts with the protein clearance system, autophagy, in the brain. Here, we describe an update on the link between inflammation and autophagy pathways. Some of the vital challenges for the presented link included investigation of the questions: What is the role of inflammation mediators in the brain under various conditions; and how altered level of inflammatory mediators affects the performance of autophagy at molecular level.

TI miR-412-5p targets Xpo1 to regulate angiogenesis in hemorrhoid tissue

AB Hemorrhoid is a common and recurrent proctological disease, which is often accompanied by angiogenesis and edema. MicroRNAs in the DLK1-DIO3 imprinted clusters are involved in the development and pathogenesis of mammalian hemorrhoids. Results of the present study indicated multiple, differential expression of DLK1-DIO3 imprinted cluster microRNA between hemorrhoid and normal tissues, where miR-412-5p expression in hemorrhoid tissue was significantly decreased. Fluorescein reporter assays showed that miR-412-5p silenced Xpo1 mRNA expression by targeting its 3'-UTR. Overexpression of miR-412-5p in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) indicated that proliferation, migration and formation of vascular structures in HUVECs were inhibited in vitro. In addition, overexpression of miR-412-5p significantly inhibited Xpo1 expression and promoted upregulation of the p53 protein and its retention in the nucleus. Simultaneously, expression of p66(SHC) and p16 proteins was activated. In summary, downregulation of endogenous miR-412-5p expression in hemorrhoid vascular endothelial cells leads to high expression of the target gene Xpo1 and translocation of the p53 protein out of the nucleus, rendering it unable to activate p66(SHC) and p16. This ultimately weakens regulation of the vascular endothelial cell cycle, thereby accelerating the division of hemorrhoid vascular endothelial cells, leading to angiogenesis.

ID PHENOTYPE
AB Congenital nystagmus (CN) is a heterogeneous disease that shows variable clinical features. There are a few mutations that are known to cause CN. Among them, a PAX6 mutation is known to cause CN with an extremely high frequency of aniridia. Here, we report on a family with an autosomal dominant PAX6 mutation, c.214G > A (p.Gly72Ser.), who presented with CN in the absence of aniridia. This study describes detailed clinical findings, including videonystagmography and fundus photography findings and emphasizes the importance of screening for the PAX6 gene in patients who present with CN in the absence of aniridia, as this will further elucidate the known phenotypes of PAX6-related diseases.

AB The catalytic co-pyrolysis behaviors, kinetics and products distribution of spirulina (SP) and oil shale (OS) were studied by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and pyrolysis-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (Py-GC/MS). Results indicated that OS delayed the thermal decomposition of organic matters in SP; there existed inhibition for aromatics production under 310 degrees C and synergistic effects at high temperatures, and a maximum synergistic effect was achieved with 30% OS. HZSM-5 and CaO enhanced the deoxygenation and aromatization reaction, resulting in a prominent decrease of acids and phenols. With the increase of CaO ratio, the relative content of aliphatic hydrocarbons increased from 9.57% to 17.48%, while the relative content of aromatics increased first and then decreased, and the maximum yield of aromatics (15.92%) was obtained at 1CaO/3HZSM-5. The appropriate CaO/HZSM-5 mass ratio contributed to the production of desired pyrolysis product. The kinetic parameters were determined by using Friedman and Flynn-Wall-Ozawa (FWO) method. As the oil shale blending ratio increased, the average activation energy (E) of mixtures decreased from 278.84 kJ/mol to 192.53 kJ/mol (from 265.51 kJ/mol to 189.63 kJ/mol), related to the catalytic decomposition of organic matter by alkaline earth metals in OS ash. The minimum E value of catalytic pyrolysis 5SP/5OS was achieved at 1HZSM-5/3CaO (257.29 kJ/mol and 269.6210/mol). This paper could offer significant pyrolysis knowledge for obtaining high-grade oil from SP and OS with HZSM-5 and CaO.

AB The effects of the addition of primary alcohol fuels (methanol, ethanol, and n-butanol) on the combustion characteristics and performance of natural gas engines are examined by experimentation with a dual-fuel test engine, followed by a comparative analysis of the test results. The test engine was operated under a light load, at a fixed speed of 1600 rpm, and with a brake mean effective pressure of 0.387 MPa. The air-fuel ratio was held constant at the stoichiometric equivalent ratio. The engine performance was analyzed for different natural gas/alcohol fuel mixtures by using four alcohol fuel energy substitute ratios (AESRs): 0% (pure natural gas), 19%, 44%, and 60%. The experimental results indicate that faster burning rates can be obtained by mixing any of the three alcohol fuels with natural gas, compared with pure natural gas. Further, by increasing the AESR, faster flame development and flame propagation times can be obtained, and the crank angle when 50% of the mass is burned approaches the top dead center position. These outcomes lead to an advance in combustion phasing. The addition of primary alcohol fuels in the dual-fuel mode can also reduce total hydrocarbon and nitrogen oxide emissions. Moreover, the brake thermal efficiency of natural gas can be improved significantly by adding methanol, whereas negligible improvements in this aspect are obtained by adding ethanol and n-butanol. The comparative analysis indicates that methanol addition has advantages over ethanol and n-butanol additions in increasing the brake thermal efficiency and reducing the regulated emissions of natural gas engines.

AB Exergetic analysis consists in the evaluation of the exergetic balance on experimental data. When applied to an internal combustion engine, exergetic analysis can identify sources of inefficiency and potentialities for utilizing exergy that would be rejected. To perform this analysis, experimental data were acquired for different operating conditions of a spark-ignition engine by using gasohol and hydrous ethanol as fuels. With these data, an exergetic analysis was carried out by evaluating the effects of engine operating parameters on associated irreversibilities. Afterwards, a comparison between the exergetic analyses of hydrous ethanol and gasohol was presented. Finally, first and second law efficiencies were evaluated as functions of engine speed, engine load and air-fuel ratio. Exergy distributions of hydrous ethanol at different conditions and the accounts of exergy losses during engine operations were also evaluated.

AB Energy harvesters, especially nonlinear systems with broad bandwidth, have made it possible for devices in IoT (Internet of Things) to extract energy from the ambient environment. However, due to the multistability feature of the nonlinear system, high and low energy orbits coexist in the system. It is critical to control the multistability so as to obtain high energy output. This paper proposes the load perturbation method to attain the high-energy orbit of nonlinear energy harvesters. Based on the electromechanical model, investigating the electrical load effects on the system shows that varying load results in different system states, which suggests that the load perturbation may trigger the transformation of system states. Therefore, a load perturbation by disconnecting the electrical load is employed to attain the high-energy orbit. Simulation and experiments reveal that the load perturbation can stimulate high-energy orbit oscillation for both monostable and bistable systems. The power output can be amplified for multifold times. The perturbation requires only one switch without additional mechanical structures. Furthermore, this method consumes little energy so that no external electrical energy source is needed. The load perturbation method opens opportunities for wide applications of nonlinear energy harvesters.

AB Obtaining high-precision wind speed prediction results is very beneficial to the utilization of wind energy and the operation of the power system. The purpose of this study is to develop a novel model for wind speed causality processing and short-term wind speed forecasting. In this study, the hybrid model combining causality processing strategy called "decomposition- virtual nodes-pruning" and Long Short-Term Memory Network based on Neighborhood Gates is proposed to obtain high-precision wind speed predictions. First, Pearson Correlation Coefficient, Maximal Information Coefficient and Granger causality test are used to explore the correlation and causality between wind speed and meteorological factors. Then, the causality is divided into five categories: center, chained, ring, tree and network causality, according to the topological structure of causality. Next, all types of causality can be unified into an equivalent tree causality by the causality processing strategy. Afterward, Long Short-Term Memory Network based on Neighborhood Gates is proposed to dynamically adjust the network structure according to the specific equivalent tree causality. Finally, the performance of the proposed model is verified by eight models from three aspects with different features, different methods and different equivalent trees in the case in Fuyun meteorological station, Xinjiang province, China. The evaluation metrics of the prediction results obtained by the proposed model are optimal among the eight models. The experimental results show that the proposed model is very competitive and very suitable for processing complex causality in wind speed prediction.

AB Partial shading is the most commonly occurring scenario among the modules of the photovoltaic arrays invoking power and mismatch losses. To attenuate these losses, various interconnection topologies for partial shading mitigation have been proposed in the literatures. This paper proposes a fixed electrical reconfiguration technique for the modules that facilitates distribution of the effect of shading in the entire array thereby reducing the losses caused by partial shading. The technique proceeds with renumbering of the modules according to the proposed algorithm followed by electrical rewiring. The entire study has been accomplished by using MATLAB/Simulink environment and field experiment for the arrays of different sizes. The validity of the proposed technique has been critically evaluated using various artificially created shadings and compared with the hitherto known conventional and hybrid topologies. The response of the array having various topologies for every shade condition has been analysed using the characteristics curves and various performance parameters. From the study, it has been found that the proposed technique excels in performance in terms of reducing the number of peaks in the characteristics curves and maximizing power generation during all shade scenarios as compared to other topologies.

AB This paper evaluates the annual dynamic performance and techno-economic feasibility of a solar fuels process driven by concentrated solar power (CSP). The process integrates solar supercritical water gasification (SCWG) of microalgae, syngas storage, and downstream Fischer-Tropsch (FT) synthesis, to produce renewable drop-in liquid transport fuels. Performance curves for key components, derived from design-point and off-design simulations in steady-state flowsheet models established in the previous work of the authors, are incorporated into a dynamic energy-based model of the overall plant in OpenModelica. Control units are implemented to model the high-level state transitions of the plant relating to ramp-up and ramp-down of solar-SCWG and FT units as well as syngas storage and dispatch. There is significant uncertainty about the achievable ramping time for FT plant, owing to the dynamics of the synthesis of long-chain hydrocarbons in the FT reactor, so this is modelled as a variable-duration ramp-up with no useful product output. A perfect one-day-ahead forecast scheduler is developed to regulate the supply of solar syngas to the FT unit to minimise these ramp-up events. The levelised cost of fuel (LCOF) for the plant is minimised using a genetic algorithm to adjust the solar multiple and syngas storage capacity of the plant, with weather data and location of Geraldton in Western Australia. The optimal configuration has a solar multiple of similar to 4 and syngas storage of similar to 20 h, and achieves an LCOF of similar to 3.5 AUD/L (similar to 2.5 USD/L) and capacity factor of similar to 72%. Sensitivity analysis shows that the price of the farmed microalgae feedstock has the strongest influence on the LCOF. The one-day-ahead syngas dispatch scheduler contributes an LCOF reduction of 19% compared to an immediate dispatch strategy. The importance of the FT ramping time in these simulations suggests that fast-ramping FT reactors (e.g. microchannel reactors) will be essential for the techno-economic success of solar-gasified FT fuels, and motivates further research and development on this topic.

AB This paper investigates the impact of biomass components (i.e. cellulose and lignin) on direct production of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) from renewable biomass by means of microwave pyrolysis at low temperature. Palm Kernel Shell (PKS) was treated using two methods to isolate its bio-components, i.e. cellulose and lignin. The treated PKS samples were then pyrolyzed under microwave at 600 degrees C. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis revealed the formation of a large number of CNTs on the surface of cellulose bio-chars, while no CNTs were formed from lignin under the same pyrolysis conditions. It was inferred that cellulose was the component responsible for the formation of CNTs during microwave pyrolysis of biomass. High-resolution transmission electron microscope (HRTEM) analysis revealed that CNTs formed under such conditions had a multiwall structure. Raman spectroscopy analysis showed that the carbon order of CNTs increased when cellulose was used instead of the raw biomass for the synthesis of CNTs. Further analysis of the volatiles showed that unlike lignin, the volatile matter derived from cellulose were rich in monosaccharides such as D-Glucopyranose and glucopyranose which were postulated to have acted as an effective carbon source for the formation of CNTs. Self-extrusion of volatiles rich in monosaccharides and hydrocarbons during pyrolysis of cellulose, followed by the condensation and re-solidification of volatiles on the softened cellulose particles at elevated temperatures was proposed as the mechanism of formation of CNTs. The findings of this study may pave the way for the development of an effective, sustainable, and low-cost method for large scale production of CNTs from renewable biomass.

AB Cyclohexanone ammoximation is widely used as an efficient method to synthesize cyclohexanone oxime in industrial production. In this study, the cyclohexanone ammoximation production process was explored based on reaction kinetics in order to reduce its energy consumption and total annual cost. The effects of the reaction temperature, space time, and raw material ratios on the cyclohexanone oxime yield were analyzed. Under the optimized operating conditions, the maximum C6H11NO yield was 99.86%, and the minimum total annual cost was 5.988 x 10(7) $ per year. Dynamic control of the cyclohexanone ammoximation production process was further explored under the optimized conditions. The proposed control structure could achieve effective control and maintain the desired product yield when flow rate and composition disturbances were introduced. The energy and exergy analyses of the cyclohexanone ammoximation process show that its energy efficiency can be improved from a thermodynamic perspective. The combination of a steady state simulation and dynamic control, thermodynamic analysis, and economic performance evaluation provide insight into the improvement and operation of the cyclohexanone oxime production process.

AB A detailed exergy cost and thermoeconomic analysis applied to a Rankine Cycle (RC) coupled to a Multi-Effect Distillation (MED) plant was performed. The aim of this work is to identify the impact of design and operating conditions on the exergy and thermoeconomic costs of the final products, electricity, and freshwater, and to assess the distribution of the destroyed exergy, the fuel, and the plant costs. The plant model considers a high disaggregation model, which includes MED plant and condenser parasitic losses, a seawater pumping system and a brine energy recovery system. It also considers solar molten salts as the RC fuel, which is the typical fluid used in solar tower plants. The impact of RC + MED plant part-load operation, ambient temperature, MED plant size, and location plant's altitude was evaluated and an analysis of operational day of the RC + MED plant was carried out. Results indicate that the plant part-load operation has a significant influence on the unit exergy and thermoeconomic product costs, while the ambient temperature evidences only a minor effect on the water costs. As well, the largest MED plant sizes (above 50,000 m(3)/day) offer the lowest electric and water costs, while the altitude strongly increases the water costs.

AB The aim of this paper is to present an on-line adaptive equivalent consumption minimum strategy (AECMS) for fuel cell hybrid electric vehicle powered by fuel cell, battery and supercapacitor. In order to design the AECMS, an equivalent consumption minimum strategy (ECMS) without considering power sources degradation is firstly designed to decrease hydrogen consumption and degradation of power sources, which chooses fuel cell as the main power source to supply steady power, battery as the main energy storage source to buffer energy demand by vehicle and supercapacitor as the peak power supplier. A testbench is built to validate the developed ECMS. By contrastive experimental tests on ECMS, Rule Based Control Strategy (RBCS) and a Hybrid ECMS Operating mode control Strategy (HEOS) through the built test bench, hydrogen consumption of ECMS decreases 2.16% and 1.47% respectively and it also has the smoothest fuel cell current. Along with the degradation of fuel cell and battery, the charge sustenance objective of battery cannot be reached. Therefore, AECMS is finally designed to adjust equivalent factors and fuel cell dynamic current change rate along with the state of health (SOH) of fuel cell and battery, to make sure the charge sustenance of battery and prolong the lifetime of fuel cell. The method that on-line estimates their SOHs and the effects of their degradation on ECMS are also analyzed.

AB In order to promote the environmental conservation and energy efficiency, sufficient attention has been paid to biomass gasification-based combined cooling, heating and power (BGBCCHP) systems. Accurate evaluation of BGBCCHP systems is helpful to improving its performance. The maximum generalized entropy principle was introduced to reveal the essential characteristics of BGBCCHP systems. The BGBCCHP system was regarded as an open and evolutionary information network. Annual total cost, annual primary energy consumption, annual carbon dioxide emissions and exergy efficiency were used as evaluation criteria. Reasonable weights were conferred to the criteria so as to make the system stable. Moreover, an evaluation model based on the maximum generalized entropy principle was established to determine the eigenvalues of the BGBCCHP system. Self-organizing feature map network was used to simulate the evaluation model of the BGBCCHP system. A case study based on an office building in Beijing, China, was carried out. Three operating strategies (following the thermal load, following the electric load and following the hybrid electric-thermal load) were considered in the evaluation of the BGBCCHP system. Sensitivity analysis was carried out to investigate the impact of economic and technical parameters on the evaluation results. Results indicated that the evaluation model based on the maximum generalized entropy principle could be used to evaluate the BGBCCHP system operated under different operating strategies. The BGBCCHP system operated following the electric load achieved the maximum eigenvalue, which showed that its best integrated performance. On the contrary, the BGBCCHP system operated following the thermal load achieved the minimum eigenvalue, which showed that its worst integrated performance. The impact of sensitivity factors on the eigenvalues of the BGBCCHP system was different, which showed that the integrated performance of the BGBCCHP system was closely related to such factors.

AB Centrifugal heat pumps with waste heat recovery have a bright application future in industry field due to their large heating capacity and high supply water temperature. Two kinds of advanced heat pump systems are proposed and analyzed to improve the energy efficiency. The system performances are analyzed and compared for three kinds of centrifugal heat pump systems: the one-cycle two-compressor system, two-compressor parallel system, and two-cycle parallel system. According to the simulation results, the two-cycle parallel system shows great advantages in the heating capacity, power capacity, and system COP (coefficient of performance). For 30 degrees C evaporator inlet water temperature and 60 degrees C condenser outlet water temperature, the COP improvements of the two-compressor parallel system and two-cycle parallel system are 7.7% and 15.5%, respectively. When the condenser outlet water temperature is 80 degrees C, the system COP of the two-cycle parallel system is 9.6% and 19.0% higher than that of the one-cycle two-compressor system with 30 degrees C and 60 degrees C evaporator inlet water temperatures. The COP of the two-compressor parallel system is 5.2% and 10.2% higher than that of the one-cycle two-compressor system under the same working condition. When the temperature lift is kept at 30 degrees C and the condenser outlet water temperature changes from 60 degrees C to 90 degrees C, the maximum and minimum COP of two-cycle parallel system are 6.7 and 6.1, respectively, which is at least 6.8% higher than the COP of the two-compressor parallel system and 13.5% higher than that of the one-cycle two-compressor system. The experimental validation is conducted, and the results indicate that the two-cycle parallel system can satisfy the high-temperature, large-capacity, and high-efficiency requirements for industrial applications.

AB The large-scale natural gas reforming is currently the lowest cost method for hydrogen (H-2) production. However, the mixture of H-2 and CO2 in the produced gas inevitably includes CO2 and necessitates the costly CO2 separation. In this work, a novel chemical looping combustion-assisted chemical looping methane reforming technology (CLC-CLRHC) was proposed to enhance the separated production of H-2 and CO in high purities in the absence of CO2. This novel reforming process not only produces high purity CO, H-2, and even N-2 without pollutants and/or GHG emissions, but realizes the energy coupling. The aim of this study is to thermo-dynamically analyze the operational parameters of the proposed new system, involving the optimized utilization of CH4, maximization of energy coupling and productivity yields and purity. Studies revealed that the optimal molar ratios for the Fe3O4/CH4, CaO/CH4 and H2O/CH4 in the chemical looping methane reforming process (CLRHC) were found to be 1.7, 1.0, 1.9, respectively. The molar ratio of the required additional CO2 from the chemical looping combustion to oxygen carriers should be 0.29. The heat balance between the CLRHC and the CLC was achieved via temperature settings of the air preheating prior to the air reactor of the CLC above 306 degrees C. Under the optimal conditions, the H-2 purity, H-2 yield, CO purity, CO yield and CH4 conversion were 98.55%, 2.26 mol/mol, 96.18%, 1.7 mol/mol and 99.24% respectively. The exergy efficiency of the system is about 70.60% and the CO2 utilization efficiency up to 94.62%.

AB The management of solid waste has become increasingly challenging with the accelerated growth in residency in Singapore. Alternative utilization, such as high temperature thermal energy storage material, valorizes the waste to the status of a new resource, thereby reducing the need of virgin material and ensuring sustainability. In Singapore, coal is co-fired with biomass and the coal/biomass fly ash is partially reused and the rest is landfilled. This research evaluated two different fabrication routes: conventional sintering and plasma processing. The novelty of this study is that unlike most studies whereby plasma arc is used to melt the ash at high temperature, in this study, a 13.56 MHz radio frequency plasma is used to control discharge parameters through in-situ diagnostics of active species density and temperatures. This allows for high throughput and uniform processing. An optimized plasma process could potentially reduce the total number of processing phases, with a lower energy budget for processing, while increasing the controllability of the processes to achieve the desired material properties. The chemical composition, and the thermal properties such as specific heat capacity, energy density and thermal conductivity of the ceramics made from coal/biomass fly ash were evaluated. Experimental evaluation shows that the radio frequency plasma processed coal/biomass fly ash samples were found to improve the thermal properties of coal/biomass fly ash in general. It is hypothesized that the mechanism of improvement from radio frequency plasma was due to the incorporation of hydrogen into the material and the conversion of mineralogical composition (i.e. quartz) which gave rise to the better performance. In conclusion, this study has shown the potential of using coal/biomass fly ash as thermal energy storage material through innovative process such as radio frequency plasma discharge.

AB Albeit some studies discussing the performance of the hybrid chiller based CCHP systems and the only an absorption chiller (AC) based CCHP systems from different perspectives, however, there is still lack of theoretical studies focus on the comparison of these two types CCHP systems and screen out the suitable users for CCHP systems. In this research, instead of the case study, the dimensionless energy-matching parameters and map are extracted and designed to quantitative analyses the matching performance for these two systems. Energy saving rate (ESR), CO2 emission reduction (CO2ER), and operation cost reduction (CostR) for these two systems under different operation strategies are compared based on two situations: 1) the redundant electricity that systems produced neither can sold back to the grid, nor can used by the electric chiller; 2) the redundant electricity can used by the electric chiller. According to the comparison, the comprehensive operation strategy maps are drawn to guide systems running in the off-design condition, which are suitable for different energy-matching performance in ESR, CO2ER, and CostR. Meanwhile, an optimisation operation strategy (FOL) is proposed for the hybrid chiller based CCHP systems and its suitable application scenario is also calculated based on the operation strategy map. Finally, boundaries of suitable user demands for CCHP systems (ESR > 15%) in China are applied during summers and winters.

AB A transcritical CO2 heat pump (HP) system for residential space heating integrated with direct dedicated mechanical subcooling (DMS) is proposed, and mathematical models are developed to study the annual energetic and economic performances considering the influence of frosting. The operation characteristics by adopting different heating terminals used in five typical cities are also assessed. The results show a maximum coefficient of performance (COP) is achieved at the optimum discharge pressure and subcooling degree. The COP is promoted by 24.4% and the discharge pressure is decreased by 2.093 MPa at the ambient temperature of -10 degrees C and water supply/return temperature of 45/40 degrees C. The seasonal performance factor (SPF) is enhanced more noticeably for severe cold region. For the case of Harbin using floor-coil radiator (FCR) or normal fan-coil unit (N-FCU) as heating terminal, SPF is improved by 32.0%. The highest SPF is achieved when small temperature difference fan-coil unit (STD-FCU) is employed. The exergy efficiency can also be apparently improved, especially for the cities located in severe cold region and using FCR or N-FCU as heating terminal due to the reduction in throttling loss of CO2 system. The purchased equipment cost and electricity cost of the CO2 HP with DMS are both lower than those of traditional CO2 heat pump system. The CO2 HPDMS system using STD-FCU as heating terminal shows superior economical efficiency to traditional system, with levelized annual total cost reduced by 7.51-15.27%.

AB The present paper is focused on the development of a high-performance, monofuel, spark ignition engine running on natural gas, featuring a high volumetric compression ratio and a variable valve actuation system. More specifically, the cylinder head geometry effect has been analyzed and the compression ratio has been optimized by means of steady-state and transient simulation activity, as well as of an extensive experimental campaign. The compression ratio effect was mainly investigated by means of experimental tests but a few 3D simulations were also run in order to quantify its impact on the in-cylinder tumble and turbulence. The main novelty of the paper are, first, the adoption of very high engine compression ratio values, second, the combined optimization of the cylinder head design and compression ratio. The main results can be summarized as follows. The engine configuration with mask showed a decrease in the average discharge coefficient by 20-30% and an increase in the tumble ratio by around 200% at partial load. Moreover, the simulation of the engine cycle indicated that the presence of the piston modifies the tumble structure with respect to the steady-state simulation case. An increase in the tumble number and turbulence intensity by around 90% and 10%, respectively, are obtained for the case with mask at 2000 rpm and 4 bar. With reference to the combustion duration, on an average, the presence of the masking surface led to a reduction of the combustion duration (from 1% to 50% of mass fraction burned) between 2 and 6 degrees. As far as the engine compression ratio is concerned, the value of 13 was finally selected as the best compromise between combustion variability, engine performance at full load and fuel consumption at partial load.

AB In this paper, a cascade LiBr/H(2)Oabsorption refrigeration/transcritical CO2 process is proposed to recover 90-150 degrees C low-grade waste heat. The proposed system consists of two subsystems: LiBr/H2O cycle and transcritical CO2 cycle. The low-grade waste heat is utilized by LiBr/H2O cycle and transcritical CO2 cycle in a cascade approach. Two optimization strategies, following efficiency of performance (FCP) and following net electricity generation (FNG), are proposed to design the cascade LiBr/H2O absorption refrigeration/transcritical CO2 process. A series processes on various refrigeration temperature (i.e., 2 degrees C, 3 degrees C, 4 degrees C, 5 degrees C, 7 degrees C, and 10 degrees C) are designed following the two optimization strategies. Key parameters in terms of refrigeration temperature, segment temperature, and high pressure are analyzed. In addition, the performance of the designed processed are compared based on the simulation results. Results show that the proposed system shows a better performance at the lower refrigeration temperature of the LiBr/H2O cycle. The high pressure under FCP is larger than that under FNG. The investment and profit of the optimal design under FCP are both more than that under FNG. This work provides a potential way to generate electricity using low-grade waste heat.

AB An experiment is carried out to research the thermo-hydraulic performance of TiO2-H2O nanofluids in triangle tubes while taking the effect of twisted tapes into consideration. The theories of thermal and exergy efficiency are applied to estimate this system. The influence of mass fractions of nanoparticles (0.1 wt%, 0.3 wt% and 0.5 wt%), Reynolds numbers (Re = 800-9000), different structures of triangle tubes (isosceles right triangle tube (tube 1), isosceles 45 degrees triangle tube (tube 2)) and twisted tape on the Nusselt number, Nusselt number ratio, resistance coefficient, resistance coefficient ratio and pressure drop are experimentally studied respectively. Results show that there are three positive factors for heat transfer performance including large nanoparticles concentration, large Reynolds number and existence of the twisted tape. Compared with the smooth tube, tubes (tubes 1 and 2) with twisted tape can enhance heat transfer, but that without twisted tape can deteriorate heat transfer, for heat transfer performance, tube 2 is better than tube 1. Tube 2 with twisted tape has the biggest value of comprehensive performance index R3. A better exergy efficiency performance can be obtained when Reynolds number is greater than 5000 and the exergy efficiency reaches the best when Re = 8000.

AB A general dynamic model of monolith catalytic reactors is developed to elucidate the intricacy of the physicochemical phenomena that occur in it. The dynamic model includes microkinetic reactions on a washcoat catalyst, which is incorporated in a heat- and mass-transfer submodels based on the quasi-2D analysis of both gasand solid-phases. To support the derived general dynamic model, a dimethyl ether (DME) catalytic reactor that uses Pt/ZSM-5 catalyst is developed and simulated. The model prediction is validated using experimental data under nearly stoichiometric, lean, and rich conditions. The results demonstrate the catalytic conversion and selectivity of DME, distribution of the wall temperature, distribution of the species concentrations in steady-state, and transient response of the catalytic reaction. We found that the time response of the lowest inlet-gas temperature can be yielded similar to 6 min, but the DME conversion is limited under the low-temperature condition.

AB For the efficient utilization of algal biomass for gaseous biofuel production, hydrothermal acid pretreatment was employed in this study to hydrolyze algal bloom biomass harvested from Dianchi Lake in Yunnan Province of China. The hydrolyzed algal biomass was subjected to sequential dark hydrogen fermentation and anaerobic digestion to improve energy conversion efficiency (ECE). The results of X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and scanning electron microscopy indicated that hydrothermal heating with increasing concentrations of sulfuric acid (H2SO4; 0-8%) led to stronger damage to amorphous cellulose, which resulted in the increase in crystallinity index of cellulose. Hydrothermal heating with 4% H2SO4 resulted in the maximum ECE of 55.7%, which yielded 37.33 mL H-2/g.total volatile solids (TVS) and 261.93 mL CH4/g-TVS. However, the yields of hydrogen and methane were significantly reduced after hydrothermal pretreatment with 8% H2SO4 which was most likely due to the substantial inhibitory effects on the bacteria and methanogens, caused by excess sodium ions introduced during pH adjustment process.

AB World energy demand is continuously increasing due to population growth, extensive urbanization and rapid industrialization as growth in global energy demand will rise by 30% in 2040. This demand can be met by utilizing traditional and alternative energy resources and by enhancing energy efficiency. The energy efficiency of an energy intensive process may be improved by utilization of waste or low grade energy, design and operation optimization, and running the plant in flexible mode with improved control strategies. Waste heat of an industrial plant can be utilized by employing the so called absorption refrigeration systems (ARS). ARS is capable of utilizing the low quality energy or waste heat which otherwise may have been lost as compared to conventional compression refrigeration system (CRS) where huge quantity of electricity is required for compression of the refrigerant. One of the major concerns associated with ARS is its low efficiency. Efficiency improvement of ARS can be achieved by analyzing and optimizing the various configurations of ARS using any mathematical technique. In the present work, the aim is to analyze and maximize the performance of ARS using exergy efficiency instead of conventional coefficient of performance (COP) approach. Both the series and parallel flow configurations have been considered for the analysis and optimization. Thermodynamic model has been implemented in MATLAB degrees using the best available correlations for phase equilibria and thermodynamic properties. Operating conditions including temperatures of all the units of both configurations of ARS and distribution ratio for parallel configuration have been optimized. Genetic Algorithm (GA) was used to optimize the operating conditions. The effect of distribution ratio and effectiveness of heat exchanger on the maximum allowable temperature of low pressure generator (LPG) and high pressure generator (HPG) to avoid crystallization has also been evaluated. Exergy efficiency of parallel flow configuration came out to be 6.45% more than that of series flow configuration at nominal operating conditions. At optimal operating conditions, exergy efficiency improved by 11.6% and 20.81% for series and parallel flow configurations, respectively. Furthermore, exergy efficiency for parallel flow configuration is 15.1% higher than series flow configuration at optimal operating conditions. The effect of variation of effectiveness of solution heat exchangers on the optimization results has also been evaluated. Effect of weather conditions, type of energy source, application for solvent cooling and variable cooling load also needs to be considered in future.

AB The thermodynamic and thermoeconomic performances of a 21 MW geothermal power plant with air-cooled two level binary type organic Rankine cycle was numerically investigated based on its design and operating data. The investigated plant is the Sinem Geothermal Power Plant in Germencik, Aydin, Turkey. The paper provides a detailed comparison of the exergetic performance of this plant with other eight similar type of plant units, which make use of geothermal resources with similar specific exergies. Results indicate that the exergetic efficiency of the Sinem Geothermal Power Plant is the highest with 48.2% and the others vary between 9.6% and 42.7%. This result is mainly related to the exergy losses due to suppression of heat transfer in this plant, via low temperature brine reinjection, small temperature difference in the heat exchangers and high efficiencies of the individual components. First and second law efficiencies, as well as the exergy losses and improvement potentials of each component in the plant are also calculated. In air-cooled geothermal power plants, since ambient temperature is a critical parameter for the plant performance, both thermal and economic analysis of the plant is performed based on variation in ambient air temperature. Specifically, thermoeconomic analysis of the plant is evaluated to determine the exergoeconomic factor, the relative cost difference and the sum unit cost of the product (SUCP) of the plant. The effect of ambient temperature on the SUCP of the power plant, power generation, energy and exergy efficiencies are also examined in the present study. The results showed that; when the ambient temperature increases from 5 degrees C to 35 degrees C the reduction in power generation is 6.8 MW, energy efficiency decreases from 13.7% to 9.2% while exergy efficiency decreases from 54.9% to 36.7 and SUCP of the plant increases from nearly 230 $/GJ to 330 $/GJ.

AB The Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC) system is a rather promising technology for waste heat recovery. However, waste heat source generally presents a fluctuating behavior, which is a big challenge to the security and efficiency of the ORC. An improved dynamic model of ORC system with zeotropic mixture is firstly developed, which can be better adapted to the phase change process of working fluid. Accordingly, dynamic behavior of the ORC and dynamic distribution of evaporation stages are investigated. Besides, three control strategies are proposed to improve the performance of steadiness with external controllable conditions. Results show that a sudden abnormal change occurs in specific enthalpy of working fluid at the evaporator outlet when different disturbances are imposed to the system. It is found that the proposed control strategies are adapted to different heat source fluctuation. The control strategies with feedforward control system work well with low frequency variation of heat source temperature.

AB Due to the increasing demand for green and industrial biodiesel production, recyclable and stable catalysts need to be developed. Li/NaY zeolite catalysts with different molar ratios of Li2CO3 to NaY zeolite were synthesized from fly ash by hydrothermal and microemulsion-assisted co-precipitation method, and used to catalyze the transesterification of castor oil with ethanol. The structure, composition and morphology of Li/NaY zeolite catalysts were characterized by thermogravimetric (TG), X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area and Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy. Under the optimized conditions of molar ratio of Li2CO3 to NaY zeolite of 1:1, calcination temperature of 750 degrees C and calcination time of 4 h for catalyst preparation, the FAEE yield of 98.6% was obtained (catalyst amount with respect to oil of 3 wt%, ethanol/oil molar ratio of 18:1, reaction temperature of 75 degrees C and reaction time of 2 h). The results show that the catalyst has excellent stability (including air tolerance and reusability) and a certain regenerative capacity (the FAEE yield was increased by 17% after activation treatment), which are crucial for industrial applications. Pseudo-first-order reactions and pseudo-second-order kinetic models were compared to demonstrate the proposed reaction mechanism. The pseudo-first-order reactions kinetic model was fit with experimental data (R-2 = 0.9906). Activation energy of 57.37 KJ/mol was required for transesterification of castor oil into biodiesel using Li/NaY zeolite catalyst.

AB In order to solve the problem of low utilization efficiency of Enhanced Geothermal System (EGS) and overlong distance between geothermal wells and energy demand sites. Based on the principle of Solution Transportation Absorption system (STA), this paper presented a long-distance cooling/heating system for dual-well EGS. Firstly, a comprehensive heat transfer model for the dual-well EGS system was established and a transport model of the long-distance STA system with no pipeline heat losses was introduced. Then, the optimization of energy outputs and maximum cooling/heating supply distance was performed. Results indicated that: although with the increase of injection flow rate and well depth, cooling and heating outputs capacity by the STA-EGS increased, however, the maximum cooling/heating supply distance decreased. Optimization of 6000 m well depth showed that optimal thermal reservoir length was about 150 m which could obtain the maximum capacity. Specially, the average maximum cooling and heating distances of the proposed system were 4 and 3.5 times that of conventional systems and the average pipe diameters of the STA-EGS decreased by 78.5%, which can greatly reduce delivery pump work and initial investment.

AB A new thermodynamic coefficient, called logarithmic factor of isobaric expansion, is defined for a better guidance in the cycle characterization of regenerative cycles working totally or partially at supercritical conditions. The logarithmic factor of isobaric expansion allows to generalize the characterization of cycles working around the critical point, agglutinating supercritical and transcritical cycles under a unique type of cycle: the pericritical cycle. The analysis of pericritical cycles allows to analyze all the cycles working around the critical point together, without the limitation that may involve the study of supercritical and transcritical cycles separately. Enthalpy and entropy balances give the internal relations among the cycle relevant variables in a thermodynamic mapping. The new thermodynamic coefficients defined in the paper identify the regions where the compression work is lower. But the lower compression work is counteracted by some limitations in the heat transfer regenerative phase, where the hot fluid of the low-pressure side heats the (same) fluid at the high-pressure side. The logarithmic factor of isobaric expansion in the compressor indicates the relevance of the compression work and the heat regeneration in the cycle, which will affect the thermal efficiency. Pericritical cycles with lower compression work and so higher limitations in the regenerative phase, handle better the inefficiencies of the cycle components at the expense of larger pressure ratios. Moreover, cycles with lower compressor inlet temperatures and higher high-side pressures take more advantage of the benefits of reducing compression work, which involves higher thermal efficiencies at the expense of larger pressure ratios.

AB The paper presents a study of retrofitting of a combined heat and power (CHP) plant aimed to increase the electric to heating power ratio. The modification would involve diverting part of the steam to the gas turbine, instead of letting it go to the steam turbine, using injection technique into a combustion chamber. Therefore, two potential retrofitting approaches are analyzed: steam injection gas turbine (STIGT) and combined steam injection gas turbine (CSTIGT). STIGT is a classic solution where live steam is diverted before the valves of a steam turbine. In CSTIGT steam is received from the turbine extraction. Both solutions increase electric power output of the cycle (STIGT by 1.33 MWe, CSTIGT by 2.68 MWe), decrease heating power (STIGT by 52.90 MWth, CSTIGT by 31.75 MWth) and decrease CHP energy efficiency (STIGT by 32 pp., CSTIGT by 22 pp.). The exergy analyses indicate that the highest exergy losses occur in the combustion chamber (61.30 MW for the reference cycle). Steam injection increase this value by 7.34 MW in STIGT and 5.65 MW in CSTIGT. However, decreasing of combustion temperature prevent the NOx emission by more than 8 g/MWh for both solutions.

AB Food waste-derived volatile fatty acids (VFAs) can act as a renewable feedstock for biodiesel production. In synthetic media, Rhodococcus sp. YHY01 was able to utilize various organic acids (acetate, butyrate, lactate, and propionate) as a carbon source. Butyrate was the optimal carbon source, having a minimum inhibitory effect on growth, and a maximum growth yield coefficient (Y-x/s 0.288 g dcw/g butyrate) and fatty acid yield coefficient (Y-f/s 0.206 g/g butyrate), compared to other organic acids (lactate, propionate, and acetate). Acetate, butyrate, and lactate mostly supported the production of fatty acids with an even number of carbons, whereas propionate enhanced the content of odd-numbered fatty acids. Response surface methodology (RSM) design study resulted in maximum biomass (2.8 g/L) and fatty acid yield (1.9 g/g) with acetate:butyrate:lactate (0.333:0.333:0.333) as a carbon source. Culture of Rhodococcus sp. YHY01 in media containing food waste-derived VFAs as the carbon source had a biomass (3.2 g dcw/L), fatty acid yield (2.2 g/L), and fatty acid accumulation (69% w/w) under nitrogen-limited condition. Biodiesel produced from food waste had an iodine value (IV, 37), cetane number (CN, 63), high heating value (HHV, 39), density (upsilon, 3.9), and viscosity (rho, 0.868) that meet international standards.

ID FEASIBILITY; PERFORMANCE
AB Desiccant-based hybrid air-conditioning systems have recently become popular owing to a reduction in their energy consumption. In addition to the dehumidification process, regeneration is a necessary process in a hybrid system, and in all previous studies the regenerator (REG) has been separated from the liquid desiccant dehumidifier (DEH), which implies the need for a complex duct configuration and a large equipment space. In the present study, a novel hybrid liquid desiccant-heat pump air-conditioning system combined with a cooling coil is proposed for deep dehumidification with a supply air humidity ratio of below 5 g/kg, where the REG, condensing DEH (cooling coil), and liquid desiccant DEH are cascaded. This system not only maintains the energy performance advantages of hybrid systems over conventional systems, it also simplifies the layout of the entire system and guarantees a compact system structure, particularly for buildings with an existing central air-conditioning-chilled-water system. Using the proposed system, a coefficient of system performance (COPsys) of 2.4-3.2 has been obtained experimentally with an supply air humidity ratio of 2.1-4.5 g/kg. Despite the compact system structure, when the air is processed from 30 degrees C and 20 g/kg to 4 degrees C and 3.6 g/kg, the proposed system achieves a superior COPsys, of 3.3 with an improvement of 13.8% when compared with a conventional liquid desiccant dehumidification system.

AB We report a method of femtosecond laser-induced vitrification of crystalline tracks laser-written in glasses with different crystallization ability including lanthanum borogermanage, barium titanium silicate and lithium niobium silicate glasses. We have found that crystalline tracks consisting of nonlinear optical LaBGeO5 and BaTi2Si2O8 phases corresponding to glass-forming compositions could be readily amorphized by the femtosecond beam, whereas the laser-induced vitrification of a track consisting of LiNbO3 crystalline phase possessing a non glass -forming composition is more complicated but also possible. The suggested technique provides reversibility of femtosecond laser-induced space-selective crystallization of glasses and thus extends the functionality of the direct laser writing of crystal-in-glass architectures that is important for the fabrication of novel integrated optical components and devices.

AB In this paper, influence of current annealing on the magneto-impedance (MI) response of the Co-based amorphous ribbons with chemical composition of Co68.15Fe4.35Si12.5B15 was investigated. In order to achieve a maximum MI ratio, ribbon samples were annealed under two different conditions: the atmospheric pressure and a vacuum pressure of 5 x 10(-3) mbar. During the annealing process, the dc electric current passing through the ribbons improved the surface structure while also changing the magnetic properties, arising from heating of the samples under proper conditions. The annealing process not only induced transverse magnetic anisotropy in the ribbon but also decreased stresses generated during melt spinning processes, thus enhancing the corresponding MI response. Annealing at different times and currents were performed in order to achieve optimum conditions and reach the maximum MI. Our results showed that the MI ratio increased for the annealed samples at both vacuum and atmospheric pressures so that the maximum MI (288%) was obtained for current annealing (at 200 mA for 65 s) in the vacuum, being promising for sensor applications. On the other hand, AFM and XRD results confirmed that less surface roughness would provide a smaller stray field, which in turn would increase the MI ratio.

AB A modified method was employed to investigate failure of the soda-lime glass under combined compression shear loading condition based on Split Hopkinson Pressure Bar. With double beveled ends loading blocks, shear component was introduced into the specimen, maximum ratio of which to normal stress was more than 40%. Both quasi-static and dynamic tests were conducted on soda-lime glass specimens in four different loading directions: 0 degrees, 15 degrees, 30 degrees and 45 degrees. With carefully pulse shaping, the dynamic equilibrium of the specimens and constant strain rate loading were satisfied. The progressive failure processes of the specimen illustrated via highspeed photographs manifested that axial splitting failure mode is dominated under both uniaxial compression and combined compression-shear loading. The non-axial cracks observed in combined compression-shear experiment resulted in the strength decline of specimen. Experimental results demonstrated an evident that the strength of soda-lime glass is strain rate and loading path dependent. A power law function was fitted to accurately describe the relationship between equivalent strength and strain rate. Failure surfaces at various strain rates were constructed, which allow us to have a further understanding of dynamic response and failure mechanism of inorganic glass under complex stress states.

ID LIFE-CYCLE ASSESSMENT
AB Traditionally, most commercial aerogels are produced by supercritical drying methods which make their application undesirable, more expensive, and less energy efficient. This paper presents the economic assessment of silica-based aerogels synthesized via ambient pressure drying. Three different approaches were considered in this paper: the production of inorganic aerogel and of two hybrid aerogels. The synthesized aerogels will be incorporated as aggregates in wall coatings to improve their thermal performance.
   The application of the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) methodology is exceedingly important since it considers all costs associated with a product, process or activity during their physical and economic life, allowing the optimization of the total costs. It was possible to evaluate the production stages of the subcritical silica aerogels that influence their final cost and their relative contribution.
   These results allow to identify the main aspects that influence the total cost of the synthesis process.
   It is important to emphasize that this study is suitable for laboratory scale activities leading to high costs. It naturally follows that an adjustment to industrial scale applications is of paramount importance and should be made to maximise the economies of scale and to achieve additional gains in efficiency.

Density measurements, thermal analysis, UV vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and theoretical modeling using Density Functional Theory were employed to identify the effect of WO3 content on the structural and physicochemical properties of these glasses. The glass transition temperature and density increase steadily with increasing WO3 content, most probably because of the formation of mixed Bi O W and La O W crosslinks. The lower band gap energy values show that the introduction of W03 or La2O3 to 60B(2)O(3).40Bi(2)O(3) glass increases the number of non-bridging oxygen species in the glass structure. The photoelectron analysis aided by theoretical calculations discover that additionally to the tetrahedrally coordinated W ions, most of the existing WO6 octahedral units in glasses with nominal WO3 content below 20 mol % are distorted, leaving practically the tungsten ions in a quasi-tetrahedral coordination. At higher WO3 content (30-40 mol%) the concentration of octahedrally coordinated tungsten atoms dominate strongly over those of tetra- and quasi-tetra-coordinated W ions. Moreover, the comparison with appropriate crystal standards allows offering a complete description of the existing bridging and non-bridging linkages and their most likely 01 s binding energies.

AB Network connectivity, physical and chemical properties of non-alkali aluminoborosilicate glasses doped with 1 mol% rare earth (RE) oxides (La2O3, CeO2, Nd2O3, Dy2O3, Y2O3 and Yb2O3) were investigated. The Gaussian fitting results of 29Si MAS NMR showed that the relative concentration of Q(4) in the network structure increased and Q3 decreased with RE-doping except the glass doped with Nd2O3. The glass doped with Yb2O3 displayed highest relative concentration of Q4 63.4%, indicating a highest degree of network connectivity. It is associated with the highest cation field strength (CFS) of Yb3+ ion among the doping RE ions. The enhancement of network connectivity resulted the improvements of Vicker's hardness, dielectric constants, glass stain point (T-st), HF- and NaOH-resistance. The glass doped with Nd2O3 contained only 43.3% Q(4) in the network structure, and the fraction is even smaller than that of glass without RE oxides. The loose structure is probably attributed to the small dielectric constant of glass doped with Nd2O3, which is the only sample with the smaller dielectric constant than the glass without RE-doping.

AB Calcium iron phosphate glasses doped with La2O3 and CeO2 have been prepared by the melting method. The structure and chemical resistance of the glasses were analyzed by XRD, FTIR and SEM. The XRD results showed that the glasses after aqueous corrosion were amorphous, while several crystals emerged after the alkali corrosion. FTIR analysis demonstrated an increase in non-bridging oxygen by adding rare earth oxides and the glass network depolymerized from Q(1) to Q(0) with the corrosion. Densities increased with increasing La2O3 and CeO2 content. SEM tests displayed that the smooth glass surface became rough with the corrosion time increasing and some cracks emerged at last. Comparing the values of the weight loss ratios of La-doped and Cedoped glasses, the latter was more corrosion resistant. The least weight loss rate was 10.85% with 2.0 mol% CeO2 addition and the Ce-doped glass had the best alkali resistance in these two series. The addition of La2O3 and CeO2 significantly improved the water and alkali resistance of the glass specimens.

AB Some particular hazardous and nuclear wastes containing a large amount of chlorine would cause the problematic processing during the waste vitrification, because of the low solubility of CI in silicate glasses. Although a few works reported the chlorine behavior in aluminosilicate glasses, the results do not always show the consistency and a small variation of glass compositions may cause the significant changes. The present work studied the dissolution of Cl in the range of alkaline earth aluminosilicate glasses with the nominal mole composition of 50SiO(2)-10Al(2)O(3)-40AeO (Ae = Ca, Sr or Ba). The solubility of Cl in the glasses with different alkaline earth species followed the order of Ca (-8.1 wt%) > Sr (-6.0 wt%) > Ba (-3.5 wt%). The glass density and glass transition temperature decreased with the addition of Cl in three types of glasses, and AeCl(2) salts, identified with X-ray diffraction, segregated from the glasses, when CI addition exceeds its solubility. Raman spectra indicate the dissolution of Cl leads to the increase of bridged oxygen bonds in glasses, supposing that Ca2+ ions are attracted by Cl ions, leaving the non-bridging oxygens that initially associated with Ca2+ ions are bonded to Si4+ (A13+) to become bridging oxygens.

AB The compositional variation of the fragility of alkali silicate glasses is shown to mimic that of most all other network forming oxide glasses when graphed as a function of a coarse-grained network connectivity which incorporates rigid structural units associated with intermediate range order. Following procedures established previously, we demonstrate how this coarse graining for both sodium and potassium silicate glasses is achieved using a variety of intermediate range order structures reported in the literature.

These phases are manifestation of network evolutions due to doping of Ge into selenium polymer chains. In present experiments/data analysis distinct power law exponents (positive and negative) in fragility and cooperative dynamics correlation are observed. Their explanations are provided for three phases across Ge Sei-x glass series. Temperature scanning study by ramp method was performed and data was analyzed with VogelFulcher type. Isothermal measurements were performed and data was analyzed with Kohlarausch stretched exponential type. However, the Kohlrausch-Williams-Watts (KWW) nonlinearity exponent fl parametrizing stretched-exponential relaxations [ exp.{(t/r)fi}l does not discern between the three phases, in its covariance with /I/Angell. In present study theoretical models for confirmation the result for correlations among properties of glasses are being suggested.

AB Silicate glasses have no long range order and a short range order similar to their crystalline counter-parts. Therefore, their key structurally distinct information lies in the medium range. The statistics of rings, describing the 3D connection of tetrahedral units, is a crucial indicator of the medium range structure. However, no experimental techniques have succeeded in quantifying the ring statistics. Here we show a heuristic method to extract ring structure information from the first sharp diffraction peak (FSDP) of the neutron scattering structure factor. We demonstrate that, for 81 commercially important silicate glasses, the real space representation I(r)-s of their FSDPs, can be consistently represented by a sum of three compressed exponentially decaying sine functions with three fixed periodicities. We propose these three characteristic periodicities are commensurate with the statistically averaged sizes of 5_ 4-, 5- and 6-membered rings, with their relative amplitudes reflecting the relative fractions. Our results are validated using Molecular Dynamics simulated glass structures. The derived ring structure information provides an insight into the structural origin of the anomaly in hardness of aluminosilicate glasses.

AB Thulium (Tm3+) doped Zinc Lead Tungsten Tellurite (ZnPbWTe) glasses having the composition 5Zn0-15Pb0. 20WO(3)-(60-x)TeO2-xTm(2)O(3) were prepared by using melt quenching technique and analysed with optical absorption, photoluminescence (PL) and PL decay spectral measurements. The absorption data was used to calculate oscillator strengths and the Judd-Ofelt (J-O) parameters. The emission spectra were recorded under 472 nm excitation exhibit intense fluorescent peaks 650 nm and 806 nm. The emission spectral data correlated with J-O theory was used to determine radiative parameters like radiative transition probability (AR), total radiative transition probability (AT), branching ratio (PR) and radiative lifetimes (T-R) for the fluorescent levels of Tm3+ ions in ZnPbWTe glasses. The decay curves for the (1)G(4) -> F-3(4) transition under 472 tun excitation were investigated to calculate experimental lifetimes (Texp) and quantum efficiency (n). The use and n reveals that ZnPbWTe glasses doped with 1 mol% of Tm3+ ions are most suitable for fabricating deep red emitting optoelectronic devices and lasers.

AB The low density (smaller than 10% of the bulk density) and the nanostructured porosity of silica aerogels provide their extremely low thermal conductivities but also impact their poor mechanical properties. Atomic scale simulation is the appropriate tool to predict the thermal and mechanical properties of such materials. For such simulations, the interatomic potential should be carefully chosen to ensure result validity but also reasonable computational times. A truncated BKS potential has been used for aerogels as it fairly reproduces the nanostructure. It allows reducing the computational time by a 3000 gain factor on the CPU time per atom per step compared to the original BKS interatomic potential while predicting correctly the mechanical properties. However, when it comes to skeletal thermal conductivity of nanoporous silica, the associated computation times are too large for a representative volume. This is due to the low thermal diffusivity of the material. Here, a new method that takes advantage of the amorphous structure of silica and the diffusive nature of phonon heat transfer at the scale of an aerogel aggregate is proposed. The time dependent temperature profile in the system obtained from Non-Equilibrium Molecular Dynamics simulations is compared to the classical solution of the thermal diffusion equation and an identification procedure is used to determine the thermal conductivity of silica aerogels.

AB Phase change materials (PCMs) are highly promising for the digital-storage technology based on the fast phase transition between the crystal and amorphous states. In order to optimize the properties of PCMs, the doping of PCMs has become research hot points nowadays. In this paper, effects of Sn doping (0%, 10%, 30%) on the crystallization behavior of Ge2Sb2Te5 (GST) films induced by a picosecond pulsed laser with Gaussian energy profile were investigated experimentally. As compared to the previous study irradiated by a nanosecond pulsed laser, such factors as melting, ablation and crystallization thresholds dropped remarkably by a picosecond laser irradiation, and with the increase of Sn content those factors were further decreased. Due to the replacement of Ge atoms by Sn atoms, the Sn incorporation expanded the lattice constant so as to introduce the mechanical stress which, together with the thermal stress generated after laser irradiation, significantly affected the atomic movement during the crystallization process. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) observations showed that GST with a lower Sn content of 10% tended to form sub-grain boundaries by local atomic shear to ensure long-range ordering of crystals, but with the increase of the Sn doping to 30%, the long-range ordering structure was broken, instead of some atoms arranged randomly, which were mainly Ge atoms, separating out from the lattice because of the replacement by Sn atoms. These extra Ge atoms were not involved in the crystallization process, proved by the Raman spectroscopy. The present study is fundamental for the design of advanced storage device based on PCMs.

AB The paper is concerned with the numerical solution of the linear steady-state regularized 13-moment equations in two space dimensions. To facilitate the understanding of the specific challenges, the equations are first divided into two subsystems before the full system is approached. The arising problems mainly stem from the complicated saddle-point structure as well as the non-standard nature of the boundary conditions. A continuous interior penalty method is presented and the pronounced advantages of utilizing high order basis functions in this setting are illustrated. To render the presented approach more efficient, a hybridization technique is presented that originates in the discontinuous Galerkin method. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

SO JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL PHYSICS

DT Article
DE Learning Kernels; Kriging; Deep learning; Data driven dynamical system;
   Support vector machine; Reproducing Kernel Hilbert space
AB Learning can be seen as approximating an unknown function by interpolating the training data. Although Kriging offers a solution to this problem, it requires the prior specification of a kernel and it is not scalable to large datasets. We explore a numerical approximation approach to kernel selection/construction based on the simple premise that a kernel must be good if the number of interpolation points can be halved without significant loss in accuracy (measured using the intrinsic RKHS norm parallel to . parallel to associated with the kernel). We first test and motivate this idea on a simple problem of recovering the Green's function of an elliptic PDE (with inhomogeneous coefficients) from the sparse observation of one of its solutions. Next we consider the problem of learning non-parametric families of deep kernels of the form K-1 (F-n (x), F-n (x')) with F-n(+1) = (I-d + epsilon G(n+1)) circle F-n and G(n+1) is an element of span {K-1 (F-n (x(i)), .)}. With the proposed approach constructing the kernel becomes equivalent to integrating a stochastic data driven dynamical system, which allows for the training of very deep (bottomless) networks and the exploration of their properties. These networks learn by constructing flow maps in the kernel and input spaces via incremental data-dependent deformations/perturbations (appearing as the cooperative counterpart of adversarial examples) and, at profound depths, they (1) can achieve accurate classification from only one data point per class (2) appear to learn archetypes of each class (3) expand distances between points that are in different classes and contract distances between points in the same class. For kernels parameterized by the weights of Convolutional Neural Networks, minimizing approximation errors incurred by halving random subsets of interpolation points, appears to outperform training (the same CNN architecture) with relative entropy and dropout.

This allows to reformulate any vector-and tensor-valued surface PDE in a form suitable to be solved by established tools for scalar-valued surface PDEs. We consider piecewise linear Lagrange surface finite elements on triangulated surfaces and validate the approach by a vector- and a tensor-valued surface Helmholtz problem on an ellipsoid. We experimentally show optimal (linear) order of convergence for these problems. The full functionality is demonstrated by solving a surface Landau-de Gennes problem on the Stanford bunny. All tools required to apply this approach to other vector- and tensor-valued surface PDEs are provided. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Building on the framework of Zhang & Shu [1,2], we develop a realizability-preserving method to simulate the transport of particles (fermions) through a background material using a two-moment model that evolves the angular moments of a phase space distribution function f. The two-moment model is closed using algebraic moment closures; e.g., as proposed by Cernohorsky & Bludman [3] and Banach & Larecki [4]. Variations of this model have recently been used to simulate neutrino transport in nuclear astrophysics applications, including core-collapse supernovae and compact binary mergers. We employ the discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method for spatial discretization (in part to capture the asymptotic diffusion limit of the model) combined with implicit-explicit (IMEX) time integration to stably bypass short timescales induced by frequent interactions between particles and the background. Appropriate care is taken to ensure the method preserves strict algebraic bounds on the evolved moments (particle density and flux) as dictated by Pauli's exclusion principle, which demands a bounded distribution function (i.e., f is an element of [0, 1]). This realizability-preserving scheme combines a suitable CFL condition, a realizability-enforcing limiter, a closure procedure based on Fermi-Dirac statistics, and an IMEX scheme whose stages can be written as a convex combination of forward Euler steps combined with a backward Euler step. The IMEX scheme is formally only first-order accurate, but works well in the diffusion limit, and - without interactions with the background - reduces to the optimal second-order strong stability-preserving explicit Runge-Kutta scheme of Shu & Osher [5]. Numerical results demonstrate the realizability-preserving properties of the scheme. We also demonstrate that the use of algebraic moment closures not based on Fermi-Dirac statistics can lead to unphysical moments in the context of fermion transport. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

AB In this paper we implement the stretched-coordinate Perfectly Matched Layer (PML) technique in [28] to emulate full power absorption outside the simulation domain for time-harmonic electromagnetic wave propagation in presence of gyrotropic dielectric tensor and curved geometry relevant for magnetized plasma devices. We recall the PML formulation as an artificial inhomogeneous lossy medium, following the stretching into the complex plane of a general system of three orthogonal curvilinear coordinates. We apply the general method in cylindrical and toroidal geometries. We then assess this technique in a simple case combining gyrotropy and coordinate curvature. Our test problem analytically quantifies the reflection of Transverse Electric (TE) cylindrical eigenmodes in a gyrotropic medium by a radial PML in cylindrical geometry. The obtained reflection coefficient involves wave, PML and geometric parameters at the PML location. The new coefficient generalizes the one obtained earlier with Cartesian coordinates, and becomes equivalent when the effects of the local cylindrical curvature at the PML (stretched) location can be neglected. These curvature effects are outlined and the limitations they impose on the properties of the PML are quantified as a function of the relevant parameters. Peculiarities related to the gyrotropy are also highlighted. Finite element calculations of the test problem in two-dimensional cylindrical geometry are exploited to verify these properties numerically. Indications are finally given on how to choose the PML parameters in order to obtain a minimal wave reflection at given numerical cost, taking into account errors associated with the numerical scheme.

AB We present a highly accurate numerical method based on a boundary integral formulation and the leaky dielectric model to study the dynamics of surfactant-covered drops in the presence of an applied electric field. The method can simulate interacting 3D drops (no axisymmetric simplification) in close proximity, can consider different viscosities, is adaptive in time and able to handle substantial drop deformation. For each drop global representations of the variables based on spherical harmonics expansions are used and the spectral accuracy is achieved by designing specific numerical tools: a specialized quadrature method for the singular and nearly singular integrals that appear in the formulation, a general preconditioner for the implicit treatment of the surfactant diffusion and a reparametrization procedure able to ensure a high-quality representation of the drops also under deformation. Our numerical method is validated against theoretical, numerical and experimental results available in the literature, as well as a new second-order theory developed for a surfactant-laden drop placed in a quadrupole electric field.

AB A multi-particle model is proposed for a coarse-grained scalar dissipation rate, where a coarse-grained quantity is defined with an ensemble average of spatially-distributed fluid particles within a finite volume. The model computes the coarse-grained scalar dissipation rate from the coarse-grained scalar gradient with a subgrid scale model of the scalar dissipation rate, which requires length-scale estimation for particle distribution. A volumetric tensor that characterizes the particle distribution is used in the model for computing the length scale and the coarse-grained scalar and velocity gradients from the particles. The model is examined in a priori and posteriori tests. A priori test with direct numerical simulation (DNS) databases of turbulent planar jets shows that the present model works well for a wide range of the length scale of particle distribution when the number of particles N-M is about 10-16. The model with N-M less than or similar to 10 overestimates the coarse-grained scalar dissipation rate, while N-M greater than or similar to 16 causes stronger dependence of the model on the length scale of particle distribution. The proposed model is tested in hybrid largeeddy-simulation/Lagrangian-particle-simulation (LES/LPS) of planar jets, where the coarse-grained scalar dissipation rate appears as an unknown variable in a mixing volume model that computes a molecular diffusion term based on a multi-particle interaction. LES/LPS and DNS yield a similar profile of the root-mean-squared scalar fluctuation, which strongly depends on the scalar dissipation rate. Comparison of the mean scalar dissipation rate between the model and the DNS shows that the present model applied to the LES/LPS well predicts the coarse-grained scalar dissipation rate at various jet Reynolds numbers.

AB This paper is concerned with the lattice Boltzmann method for general convection-diffusion equations. For such equations, we develop a multiple-relaxation-time lattice Boltzmann model and show its consistency under the diffusive scaling. The second-order accuracy of the half-way anti-bounce-back scheme accompanying the present MRT model is justified based on an elegant relation of the collision matrix. Using the halfway anti-bounce-back scheme as a central step, we further construct some parameterized single-node second-order schemes for curved boundaries. The accuracy of the proposed model and boundary schemes are numerically validated with several nonlinear convection-diffusion equations. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Direct numerical simulation (DNS) of multiphase flow yields the highest fidelity predictions of pore-scale fluid dynamics in porous media. The drawback of DNS is its high computational cost. We develop a pore-level multiscale method (PLMM) that accelerates DNS by producing successively improved approximations to the immiscible two-phase Navier-Stokes equations. PLMM starts with a binary image of the porous medium and decomposes the void space into subdomains that coincide with physical pores. For each subdomain, single-phase basis functions are constructed once. Correction functions are then computed only for subdomains containing a fluid-fluid interface. Basis and correction functions are coupled through a global problem, which yields an accurate velocity field used to propagate interfaces. By treating two-phase dynamics as local perturbations to single-phase flow, PLMM adaptively localizes computations to the displacement front. Prediction errors are additionally estimated and controlled with an iterative strategy. PLMM is parallelizable and allows for different meshes, models, and physics in each subdomain.

AB This work presents a hybrid particle-number and particle model to improve efficiency in solving population balance equations for type spaces spanning spherical and aggregate particles. The particle-number model tracks simpler, spherical particles cheaply by storing only the number of particles with a given one-dimensional internal coordinate, while the particle model allows resolution of the detailed aggregate structure that occurs due to collision and coagulation between particles by storing distinct computational entries for each particle. This approach is exact if primary particles are defined by their monomer count and the particle-number model increments in single monomers. A stochastic method is used to solve the population balance equations for the combined type space. The hybrid method works well for large ensembles (> 2(12) particles) with a detailed particle model, where performing a finite number of particle-number updates is demonstrated to be 40-50% cheaper than updating an equivalent ensemble of discrete particles. These savings can be traded for a larger sample volume to increase the resolution in the particle size distribution or more repeat runs to reduce the total error. Run time improvements are curtailed at very high surface growth and coagulation rates due to the fixed cost of growth updates on the large aggregates formed; however, the hybrid method is still attractive in this case as its primary purpose is to reduce error by preventing saturation of the ensemble with simple particles at high inception rates.

AB Wire arc additive manufacturing (WAAM) with high deposition efficiencies and material utilization rate was carried out by using AZ80M magnesium alloy in this work. The microstructure and mechanical properties of the WAAM AZ80M were tested and studied. The results showed that the WAAM AZ80M was mainly composed of alpha-Mg, beta-Mg17Al12 and Al2Y phases and had obvious inhomogeneous characteristics along the deposition direction. Because of the microstructure inhomogeneity and micro defects in the interlayer region of the WAAM AZ80M, its average tensile strength at the horizontal and vertical directions was different with the values of 308.7 MPa and 237.3 MPa, respectively.

   gradient-driven coalescence
AB By employing an in situ tension experiment in a transmission electron microscope, a stress concentration is demonstrated as a significant contributor to evolution of helium bubbles in a non-uniform stress field. In the stress concentration, a bubble growth occurs through bubble migration and coalescence driven by stress gradients as well as a dislocation slip-induced vacancy absorption upon straining. A bubble-shape evolution occurs after a coalescence of bubbles with similar size. As the bubbles grow to critical sizes, gradual elongation and disappearance of bubbles are found with further straining. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB P-type metal oxide semiconductors with special morphology have received high expectation for their potential application in gas sensors. We have synthesized hollow dodecahedral Cu2O nanocages with exposed (1 1 1) planes by a simple solution growth approach at room temperature. Characterization results indicate that the diameters of Cu2O nanocages are about 200 nm. Gas sensing performance of the Cu2O nanocages is investigated towards ethanol gas. Remarkably, the response of Cu2O reaches 4.6 at a low working temperature of 250 degrees C when the concentration is 100 ppm. The unique structure of Cu2O benefits the sensing performance owing to its active (1 1 1) planes. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Electrospinning technology is taken as the most versatile process to generate continuous nanofibers. However, effects should be taken to achieve better understanding and precisely control the actual mechanics in the formation of nanofibers through better system design. In this article, the diameter and the deposition area of the as-prepared nanofibers can be controlled by added helix tube which can provide external electric-magnetic field. The spinning process can be controlled employing a magnetic flux (B) analytical model which is based on the magnetic field calculation model of the solution and the electrostatic charge repulsion in the jet. This method includes the thermo-mechanical properties based on as-prepared electrospun nanofiber films and the capability of tribology-mechanical and mathematical physics. A novel investigation of the whole output increase at per unit spinning area is presented in this article to describe the whipping instability which is an important feature of the Taylor Cone phenomenon. The present design and process for electrospinning are based on a solution differential calculus, which a single stainless steel spinning nozzle can generate multi-squirt flow. With the purpose of providing useful jet initial behaviour design for the further technology applications, we attempt to set up a differential calculus method with evenly distributed circumferential electric field, yet giving more design guidance to produce controllable nanofibers through magnetic-field-assisted electrospinning technology.

AB To suppress sulfation in the negative electrode of the lead acid battery (LAB), N-doped carbon (NC) is synthesized by annealing chitosan under N-2 atmosphere. As an additive, NC can improve LAB's cycle stability through the suppression of irreversible sulfation. It is attributed to the formation of a carbon conductive network in the negative electrode, which can improve electronic conductivity and control growth of PbSO4 crystals. Therefore, the LAB with Pb/NC negative electrode delivers a long cycle life of 1102 at the current of 0.2 A. It is about 3.6 times that of LAB with Pb electrode. Potentially, the approach of preparing NC is simple and inexpensive. It is expected to be commercialized. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The letter reports on the surface hardening of bulk soft metal materials by protective coatings made of the same metal as bulk but with up to 6 times higher hardness than that of the bulk material. This surface hardening is demonstrated by covering of the Ti substrate with a low hardness H-b(ulk) approximate to 5 GPa by a 1200 nm thick Ti coating with a high hardness H-coating approximate to 30 GPa. The protective hard Ti coatings were sputtered by a new sputtering technology based on extremely high pressures (>= 1000 GPa), high temperatures exceeding the melting temperature T-m of the coating material and extremely high cooling rate of the created coating (>= 10(10) K/s). The principle of this technology realized at an atomic level is described in detail. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In order to realize low cost post-processing sorbent for uranium-containing wastewater, the rational design of architectures and deliberate integration of cellular materials are imperative. In this work, we present a simple strategy for preparing cellular materials with bentonite modified Portland cement (BT/PC) composite, by using preformed foam in BT/PC slurry, which can facilitate the connection of the adjacent pores and benefit from the larger specific surface area of the matrix. The adsorption capacity and efficiency of the cellular materials were investigated via static adsorption for uranium solution. It shows that the adsorption efficiency reached to 96.97% while the adsorption capacity got to 242.47 mg/g with 0.3 g sorbent, which manifests great potential for uranium-containing wastewater treatment.

AB Despite its low energy storage efficiency (similar to 46%), silver niobate (AgNbO3) is considered as a promising lead-free antiferroelectric material due to its environmental advantages. Herein, we demonstrate that the energy storage efficiency of AgNbO3 ceramics can be enhanced by applying hydrostatic pressure. The results reveal that the hydrostatic pressure contributed to the decline of remanent polarization (P-r) and the switching hysteresis Delta E. In addition, the externally applied pressure improved the reverse switching field (E-A). This indicates an enhanced antiferroelectricity, benefiting the enhancement of energy storage properties of AgNbO3 ceramics. Under the pressure of 400 MPa, the as-prepared AgNbO3 ceramics exhibited an energy storage efficiency (eta) of 56% and a recoverable energy storage density (W-rec) of 1.3 J/cm(3) under the electric field of 13 kV/mm, corresponding to an enhancement of 47% and 30%, respectively.

AB Copper (Cu)-dipicolonic acid (DPA) based metal-organic coordination polymers (MOCPs) has been evaluated as an electrode material for supercapacitors. Cu-MOCP exhibits specific capacitance of 217.3 F g (1) at 0.4 mA cm (2) and superior capacitance retention of 95.5% after 2000 cycles at 6.7 mA cm (2) in 1.0 M NaOH electrolyte using galvanostatic study. It may arouse from the micro structure in Cu-MOCP that gives enough void for storage and diffusion of electrolyte, suggesting its promising electrode material for supercapacitors.

AB Hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) has been expected as an ideal two dimensional (2D) dielectric for practical device applications. Here we demonstrate a promising technique to achieve large area and high quality h-BN thin films on iron boride (Fe2B) substrate by chemical vapor deposition (CVD). It was found that the remanent oxygen in reaction gas induces the oxidation of Fe2B alloy and yields low quality h-BN. Detailed characterizations prove the uniformity and high quality of as-grown h-BN thin films synthesised by gas purification process for removing oxygen. This facile method can be a scalable approach to synthesize large area and high quality h-BN thin films for future related electronic and optoelectric applications. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB To circumvent the liquid-solid separation and dispersion of the powdered adsorbent during adsorption-desorption circulation, using a drop-oil sol-gel method, the spherical ZrO(OH)(2)/AlOOH hybrid composite beads were prepared as an adsorbent for sulfate adsorption removal from water. The preparation mechanism was proposed and discussed in term of the characterization results showing that the as-prepared beads is an amorphous mesoporous material constructed from nanoflakes composed of rod-like nanopartides, and possesses a good sphericity, a relatively high specific surface area (195.56 m(2)/g) and adequate mechanic strength (Zr/Al(0.2)-30-3.5, 32.1 N). The adsorption tests indicated that the saturated adsorption capacity increases with sulfate concentration and decreases with prolongation of adsorbent drying time, owing to the reduction of water content, the maximum adsorption capacity can reach 205 mg/g (Zr/Al(0.2)-30-2). This work has a profound significance for the further research and industrial application of spherical adsorbent related to hydrate zirconia in fixed adsorption bed. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

DE Phase-change memory; Nanocomposites; Thin films; Doping; Sb2Te
AB We propose Y-0.03(Sb2Te)(0.97) (YST), prepared by magnetron sputtering, as a phase-change material for the application in phase change memory (PCM). The thermal stability of Sb2Te is increased by Y doping, with the crystallization temperature and 10-year data retention increase from 148.7 degrees C to 187.7 degrees C and from 55.0 degrees C to 114.5 degrees C, respectively. The grain refinement of the crystalline films is realized thanks to the inclusion of Y. On the device level, the phase transition of YST can be triggered by a 20 ns electric pulse, making it a promising candidate for PCM devices with both high operation speed and excellent thermal stability.

AB Thermally activated graphite felt (T-GF) electrode coated with carbon derived from the sugar cane bagasse (AC-SCB) was investigated for catalyzing the VO2+/VO2+ reaction in vanadium redox flow battery (VRFB). Micrographs from the scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy clearly show the highly porous structure of the carbon. The electrochemical surface area of AC-SCB based electrode is nearly 80 times higher than that of the thermally activated graphite felt (T-GF). But the rate constants calculated from cyclic voltammetry study clearly reveals the higher electrocatalytic activity toward the VO2+/VO2+ redox reaction of T-GF in comparison to that of AC-SCB. The charge-discharge study shows energy efficiency of similar to 72%, a voltage efficiency of similar to 77% and a coulombic efficiency of similar to 94% for ACSCB positive electrode based VRFB at 100 mA cm (2) at the end of 50 cycles. The specific capacity of VRFB at the end of 50 cycles for T-GF/AC-SCB and T-GF are 32 and 25 Ah L (1), respectively. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID GROWTH; LOOPS
AB In a first effort, the dislocation structure and related mass transfer in a macroporous FCC metal is studied via atomistic simulation. The interaction between the void and its periodic image has been intense ever since the onset of dislocation emission. The accumulated mass transfer is due to the emission of multiple shear loops, which shapes the morphology of the macroporous metal. The removal of mass from the intervoid ligament triggers its breakdown, connecting the voids. The strengthening of intervoid interaction is shown by running multiple cases with atom count ranging from 7.1 million to 95.4 million. The critical stress for dislocation emission versus the size of void is in a good agreement to the Lubarda model adjusted by the Gibson-Ashby scaling law. Nevertheless, the critical stress of void with a short intervoid ligament distance (ILD) demonstrates a surprisingly insensitivity of strain rate compared with the void that can be deemed standalone.

AB Biodegradable porous Zn-1Al alloy scaffolds were fabricated by air pressure infiltration method (APIM) for biomedical applications. The grains of porous Zn-1Al alloy scaffold are significantly refined due to the addition of Al. Tiny (Al) solid solution particles uniformly disperse in the grains of Zn matrix. Under the combined effect of grain size reduction and (Al) solid solution particles dispersion strengthening, the compressive yield strength of the porous alloy scaffolds is improved remarkably. During immersion tests in simulated body fluid (SBF), the porous Zn-1Al alloy scaffold can effectively induce Ca-P precipitation. In addition, the porous alloy scaffold has a lower degradation rate than the porous pure Zn scaffold in SBF. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Laser directed energy deposition (LDED) technology provides an opportunity to break through the size and geometry limitations of bulk metallic glasses (BMGs). However, the microcracks, induced by the huge thermal stress during the LDED process, seriously damage the mechanical properties of deposited BMGs, resulting in that the deposited BMGs can hardly undergo deformation in tension. In the present study, in-situ soft crystalline phases are introduced into a BMG to retard the microcracks during the LDED process. A crack-free Zr39.6Ti33.9Nb7.6Cu6.4Be12.5 metallic glass composite with a sufficient high tensile strength is successfully synthesized. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Instead, a mixture of monoclinic ZrO2 (m-ZrO2 ) and orthorhombic TaZr2.75O8 can be detected for (1-x)ZrO2-xTaO(2.5) ceramic within compositions x <= 0.2. As the doping content increases, the content of m-ZrO2 decreases and the final product in the composition of 0.72ZrO(2)-0.28TaO(2.5) is primarily composed of TaZr2.75O8. Microstructure together with the thermophysical and mechanical properties of TaZr2.75O8 ceramic were investigated for possible applications as thermal barrier coatings (TBC5). The thermal conductivity with a minimum value of 1.65 W/m.K at 800 degrees C for TaZr(2.75)O(8)( )ceramic is similar to 30% lower than that of dense YSZ and the dense ceramic also has a moderate average thermal expansion coefficient (TEC), about 9.14 x 10(-6) K-1 from room temperature (RT) to 1300 degrees C. Besides, TaZr2.75O8 exhibits a high microhardness (11.85 +/- 0.42 GPa) and fracture toughness (3.15 MPa.m(1/2)). These preliminary results indicate that TaZr2.75O8 can be used as an alternative material for the ceramic layer in TBCs system with respect to its superior thermal and mechanical properties.

AB A loofah sponge-derived 3D carbon matrix (LSC) with large specific surface area and high conductivity is prepared via a simple chemical activation and calcination process. The characterization analyses reveal that plentiful pyrrolic N groups exist in LSC, which can provide strong affinity for polysulfides species through a coordinate-like Li-N interaction, and thereby effectively alleviate the shuttle effect and the capacity decay. The Li-S cell with S/LSC cathode delivers a high initial discharge capacity of 1392 mAh g(1) and a retention discharge capacity of 848 mAh g(1) after 100 cycles at 0.1 C. The results demonstrate that the loofah sponge can be a highly efficient and cost-effective biochar for the cathode of Li-S batteries. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this study, we present a facile method for synthesizing biogenic B-Fe and B-NiFe nanoparticles using Terminalia bellirica extract. GC-MS analysis of the extract showed that n-hexadecanoic acid (24%) and octadecanoic acid (13.5%) were the predominant biomolecules. The as-synthesized B-Fe and B-NiFe nanoparticles were characterized using UV-Vis, FE-SEM with EDS, TEM, DLS based particle size analysis, and XRD. The surface morphology of the biogenic nanoparticles was compared to chemically synthesized Fe (C-Fe) and NiFe (C-NiFe) nanoparticles. FE-SEM and TEM images indicated that particles were nano-sized, however agglomeration was observed in aqueous medium. Particle sizes using DLS method followed the order: B-Ni-Fe > B-Fe > C-Fe > C-NiFe. Fe2O3 and NiFe2O4 were the predominant crystal phases in the biogenic and chemogenic nanoparticles. The biogenic Fe and NiFe nanoparticles showed higher adsorptive capacity for Cr (VI), and faster rate kinetics for methylene blue degradation in a catalyst-peroxygen assisted oxidation process, when compared to the chemogenic nanoparticles.

AB To further improve the hemocompatibility of titanium (Ti) biomaterials, a bioactive coating was prepared by self-assembly of phase-transited lysozyme (PTL) and heparin (Hep). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), atomic force microscopy (AFM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and water contact angle (WCA) measurement systematically confirmed the successful preparation of PTL/Hep coating on pure Ti surfaces. Blood compatibility assays showed that the platelet-repellent effect of the coating was significantly better than that of pure Ti surfaces. Also, the coating significantly extended the blood clotting time to 40.8 min. Besides, the hemolysis rate of PTL/Hep coated Ti substrates was only 0.39 +/- 0.13%. These results confirmed the exceedingly excellent blood-compatibility of Ti surfaces modified by the self-assembled PTL/Hep coating. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Twin boundaries are traditionally considered as straight interfaces aligned with plane invariant to twinning shear. However, inclinations of twin boundaries from ideal positions are often observed in materials with hcp structure. Such inclinations can be caused by faceting of twin boundaries. Development of {1 0 (1) over bar 0}/(0 0 0 1) facets is demonstrated for {1 0 (1) over bar 2} twin and {1 0 (1) over bar 1}/(0 0 0 1) facets for {1 0 (1) over bar 1} twin. It was shown that observed types of facets can be explained in terms of disconnection mechanism of twin growth. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The specific surface areas of the materials are over 2300 m(2) g (1) and the specific pore volume is as high as 1.92 cm (3 )g (1). The optimized material achieves a high specific capacitance of 336 F g (1) in 6 M KOH aqueous electrolyte at a current density of 0.5 A g(1), and it also shows excellent cycling stability with 97.5% capacitance retention after 10,000 cycles at a current density of 10 A g (1).

AB In this work, a facile two-step strategy had been developed to synthesize carbon coated manganese oxide for the fabrication of high performance supercapacitor. First, MnO2 nanoflakes were synthesized on Ni foam by a simple chemical deposition method. Then a thin layer of alginate sodium (NaAlg) coated the nanoflakes by electrophoretic deposition (EPD) and was calcined to carbon, which could increase the conductivity and prevent the crystal from dissolving. As a result, the carbon coated manganese oxide displayed an enhanced capacitance of 412 F g(-1) at a current density of 1 A g(-1) and the capacitance retention maintained 95.7% after 10,000 cycles of charge/discharge, indicating that the binder-free process provided low internal resistance and reversible charge storage behavior.

AB An irradiation-induced nanotwinning mechanism in zirconium and titanium is proposed, based on molecular dynamics simulations. Atomistic configurations before and after nanotwinning are characterized in Zr, Mg and Ti, using four different semi-empirical potentials. An elliptical self-interstitial cluster is identified as the precursor to nanotwinning. These elliptical self-interstitial clusters spontaneously formed and transformed into nanotwins in two cases-Zr and Ti-but not in Mg. The nanotwins are crystallographically equivalent to {11 (2) over bar1} (11 (2) over bar(6) over bar) tensile deformation twins, which are experimentally observed in Zr and Ti. We noted that nanotwins appeared in the hcp materials with low {10 (1) over bar0} prismatic plane stacking fault energy (SFE), relative to their basal extrinsic SFE. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

ID NANOCOMPOSITES
AB The objective of this work is to investigate the feasibility to use electroless plating as a feedstock powder production method for additive manufacturing of metal matrix composites (MMCs). MMCs are of importance because of their improved properties compared with existing metallic alloys for additive manufacturing. However, the current powder processing methods (e.g., high-energy ball milling) are difficult to incorporate a high fraction of nanoparticles with a homogeneous dispersion. Electroless plating is proposed to produce MMC powder in this work. Ni/Al2O3 composite powder with a high fraction of Al2O3 nanoparticles was successfully produced using a Ni electroless plating bath containing Al2O3 nanopowder. X-ray diffraction analysis was performed on the prepared powders, showing both Ni and Al2O3 phases as designed. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) characterization showed the Ni and Al2O3 phases were uniformly distributed in the powder. The Ni/Al2O3 powder was then laser melted into tracks to investigate the effects of process parameters using a commercial selective laser melting (SLM) system. SEM showed stable tracks were achieved under a wide range of process parameters. Both Ni and Al2O3 phases were identified in the melted tracks, possessing a hierarchical micro/nano-structure. The SLM behavior demonstrated the feasibility of electroless plating for producing MMC feedstock powder. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Synthesis and characterization of a novel porphyrin derivative for
   optical sensor
SO MATERIALS LETTERS
LA English
DT Article
DE Optical materials and properties; Sensors; Spectroscopy; Porphyrin
AB A novel porphyrin derivative named porphyrin-diazocine-porphyrin (PDP) has been synthesized and characterized. Optical behaviors of PDP are investigated upon concentration of trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) in dichloromethane solution. Results of UV-vis show that the absorption intensity at 420 nm changes linearly with the solution color changing from pink to green as the variation of acid concentration from pH 7 to 4.36. The fluorescence studies show that the fluorescence quenched seriously by adding TFA in the solution. These results suggest that the J-type aggregations are formed to form head-to-tail type structures. Further, studies of the optical phenomenon by adding triethylamine indicate that this J-aggregates transformation is reversible. As a consequence, the PDP can be used as an optical pH sensor material with high sensitivity and photostability. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID SPHERES
AB Novel MoSx/ZnIn2S4 photocatalysts were fabricated by a facile sonochemical deposition route with (NH4)(2)MoS4 as a precursor. The 3.0 wt% MoSx/ZnIn2S4 has been shown to significantly enhance the photocatalytic performance for H-2 evolution under visible light (lambda >= 420 nm), which is 26 times higher than that of pristine ZnIn2S4.Various characterizations and further experimental results indicate that an intimate junction formed between MoS(x )and ZnIn2S4 via sonochemical route and the MoSx not only can promote the transfer of photo-generated electron, but also provides abundant coordinately unsaturated S atoms as active sites for H-2 evolution. This study paves a new way to design efficient semiconductor composites for photocatalytic H-2 evolution. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The thermal and mechanical properties of these modified cocoons are significantly improved. Especially, the tensile strength, elongation, toughness and the average peeling force of the cocoon constructed by three silkworm larvae simultaneously are found to be 1.7, 1.5, 2.1 and 2.1 times higher than those of the normal cocoon, respectively. These special cocoons with good mechanical properties could be applied to produce high-performance artificial cocoon composites, biomimetic and ballistic materials. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

ID SURFACE-PLASMONS
AB Bullseye nanostructures with different central disk diameters and numbers of concentric rings have been fabricated in Au/Ag metallic films on glass substrates by focused ion beam milling. The Au/Ag bimetallic nanoresonator is expected to provide chemical stability and outstanding plasmonic property. A novel hybrid plasmonic emission has been observed by cathodoluminescence in the scanning electron microscope. It is found that the hybrid plasmon amplitude of the bullseye structure highly depends on the excitation position. The plasmonic intensity is the maximum when the beam is located at the edge of the central disk, and it can be tuned by selecting the disk size and the number of grooves. Additionally, the finite element simulation reveals that the bimetallic bullseye structure strongly confines the optical radiation, and the electric field distribution directly relates to the emission wavelength.

   cycling treatment
ID THERMAL-EXPANSION; TEMPERATURE; BEHAVIOR; TANTALUM
AB The rejuvenation behavior of Ta-rich particle reinforced Zr-based bulk metallic glass matrix composites upon deep cryogenic cycling treatment has been studied. The composite can be rejuvenated resulting in a higher enthalpy of relaxation and lower density. The internal stress generated from both the intrinsic heterogeneity in amorphous matrix and the interfaces between the matrix and Ta-rich phase should contribute to the rejuvenation behavior. The composite structure can generate a 4 times higher internal stress than that from the intrinsic heterogeneity, which causes the more rejuvenated state of the composites compared with the monolithic counterpart. With a higher volume fraction of Ta-rich phase, both the increment in enthalpy of relaxation and free volume between as-cast and thermal treated state increases almost linearly. The rejuvenated samples show better plasticity compared with as-cast counterparts because of more induced free volume. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Carbon nanotube aerogels are highly desirable for application in the field of the energy conversion and energy storage due to their superior electrical conductivity. Herein, three-dimensional carbon nanotube/nylon 66 (3D CNT/PA66) aerogels have been fabricated for the first time by freeze-drying, where CNTs are coated with the PA66. Meanwhile, CNT/PA66 aerogels can form a continuous conductive network at low CNTs loading. Therefore, CNT/PA66 aerogels have good electromagnetic wave (EM) absorption properties with a maximum reflection loss of -44.3 dB at 13.9 GHz, a reflection loss of less than -10 dB in the frequency range of 12.2-15.7 GHz, and a bandwidth of 3.5 GHz. Our results indicate that the CNT/PA66 aerogel is a promising platform for the preparation of high-performance EM absorbing composites. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Evolution of texture and grain refinement post high temperature scratching has been captured using electron backscattered diffraction (EBSD). The formation of dislocation substructures both inside the {1 0 (1) over bar 2} < 1 0 <(1)over bar> 1 > twin and within the grain was key in controlling the recrystallization. A significant increase in hardness has been observed in a scratched groove which has been attributed to grain refinement. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB High-pressure field assisted sintering (FAST/SPS) of half-cell for all-solid-state Li batteries was proposed and tested. The half-cell included the layer of lithium lanthanum zirconate (LLZO) electrolyte and the layer of mixed cathode. The mixed cathode consisted of lithium cobalt oxide (LCO) used as energy storage material and LLZO used as ionic conductor. A tool made of TZM molybdenum alloy was used to apply a high pressure of 440 MPa during FAST/SPS at a temperature of 675 degrees C ensuring stability of materials. An average relative density of sintered half-cell was around of 95%. The half-cell was assembled with a lithium anode and electrochemically tested. The results were compared with the performance of a half-cell sintered in an established graphite tool at the same temperature but under a lower pressure of 50 MPa and with a lower density (around of 78%). The battery with half-cell sintered at high pressure showed two-fold larger surface storage capacity. Further optimization of materials and processing is in progress. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB In this paper, NaYF4:Yb, Er nanoparticles (NPs) were coated with hydrophilic- polystyrene (HPS) by in situ polymerization. The morphologies, structures, as well as hydrophilic stabilities of theNaYF(4):Yb, Er NPs and the NaYF4:Yb, Er /HPS NPs composite were characterized by Transmission electron microscope (TEM), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and up-conversion photoluminescence spectrometry. TEM results shows that the HPS-encapsulated NaYF4:Yb, Er NPs are well dispersed and spherical in shape in water phase, the size of spherical particles was estimated to be 140 nm, FT-IR and TGA results revealed that these NPs were coated with HPS. Meanwhile, Fluorescence tests showed that after HPS coated, the fluorescent position and intensity of NPs did not changed significantly. Settlement test results revealed that HPS coated NaYF4:Yb, Er NPs had more dispersion and stability than uncoated ones in aqueous system. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

DE Polyimide; Organically-modified layered silicate; Residual stress;
   Coefficient of thermal expansion
AB Due to rise in demand for mobile devices, development of complex stacked packaging technology such as multi-chip package, capable of both small size and high volume, are in high interest. As residual stress of individual chips increases, the degree of bending rises leading to more difficulty in package assembly process and decreased reliability of the final package product. To overcome this, deeper understanding of the thermal history and thermal behavior between the polymer film and substrates are needed. In this work, residual stress-temperature profiles of thermally stable polyimidejorganically-modified layered silicate (PI/OLS) nanocomposite systems on Si wafer were investigated in situ during imidization and cooling process. This study provides systematic approach from the perspective of substrate design for multi-stacked semiconductor package. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Ag-decorated g-C3N4/Ti3C2 ternary plasmonic photocatalysts with improved visible-light photocatalytic activity of aniline were investigated. The maximum degradation rate of aniline reached to 81.8%, which could be attributed to the enhanced visible light absorption efficiency caused by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) of AgNPs, as well as the effective separation of photogenerated charge carriers owing to MXenes.

AB The hybrid magnesium-lithium-ion batteries (MLIBs) combine the advantages of Mg anode and the Li+ intercalation cathode. Constructing high-performance cathode is the key and challenge for the futuristic MLIBs research. Layer NH4V4O10 is found to be an ideal cathode for MLIBs owing to layer structure and high work voltage (similar to 1.8 V vs. Mg/Mg2+). In this work, the NH4V4O10 micro-flowers are prepared through a facile hydrothermal method. As cathode for MLIBs, the NH4V4O10 exhibits a high specific discharge capacity of 228 mAh g (1) at 100 mA g (1) in the voltage range of 0.5-2.0 V vs. Mg/Mg2+. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB An oxygen-sensitive gel material containing platinum-acetylide was successfully synthesized using covalent linkages between the isocyanate groups on the platinum-acetylide crosslinker and the hydroxyl groups on commodity polymers. It was shown that the elasticity of the gel could be tailored by changing the amount of the crosslinker. Under nitrogen, the gel provided a phosphorescence at 539 nm, which was noteworthy in that the gel material displayed phosphorescent emission without fluorescence. In contrast, changing the surrounding environment of the gel to air decreased the phosphorescent intensity ratio by 94.0%. Our study demonstrated that the platinum-acetylide crosslinker provided a high oxygen sensitivity to the gel materials composed of commodity polymers. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Fe-4.5 wt% Si alloy was solidified in the presence of an axial high static magnetic field (HSMF) to investigate the influence of magnetic field on the crystal orientation and magnetic property. With the increase of magnetic field intensity (MFI), the crystal orientation of the Fe-4.5 wt% Si alloy turns to < 1 0 0 > which is the easy magnetization axis. The specimen with strong Goss texture was obtained under a 6 T HSMF. Moreover, the saturation magnetic induction also increases with the increase of the MFI. The above results are attributed to the effect of the HSMF on the magnetocrystalline anisotropy during bulk solidification. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Multimaterial fibers which integrate novel materials and/or structures into fiber configuration aim at developing multiple functionalities and high performance. Here, we demonstrate a kind of multimaterial fibers with crystalline GeSe core and K9 glass cladding by the molten core drawing method. The as-drawn fibers undergo a change in electrical conductivity when externally illuminated by an 808 nm HeNe laser. Furthermore, the Seebeck coefficient of the fibers is comparable with bulk GeSe, while the resistance is 3-4 magnitude lower than that. The results show that the GeSe core fibers have promising applications in optical switch and thermoelectric conversion field. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This study analyzes the precipitation phenomenon in the Al-3%Mg-1%Mn alloy and shows that low-temperature annealing at 360 degrees C enables the decomposition of an as-cast Mn-enriched supersaturated solid solution and precipitation of the quasicrystalline icosahedral phase. Icosahedrons are predominantly formed heterogeneously on the dislocations and dislocation walls. Precipitates with quasicrystalline structure contain Al and Mn, free of Si, and their size varies in a range of 17-71 nm. The Ashby-Brown contrast and the ordered positions of the precipitate and matrix reflections in the SAED and in high-resolution TEM images suggest partial coherency of the quasicrystalline precipitates and aluminum matrix.

AB Superhydrophobic coatings have been prepared in this work by spraying toluene solution with different ratios of grafted epoxy resin and hydrophobic silica nanoparticles. Characterization by Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, scanning electron microscope, water contact angle techniques indicates that grafting with octadecylamine can effectively improve the hydrophobic property of epoxy resin with WCAs as high as 101.6 +/- 3.1 degrees, and that addition of SiO2 nanoparticles makes the superhydrophobic coatings of SiO2/grafted epoxy resin feasible provided that the weight percentage of SiO2 is over 35%. Moreover, the nanocomposite coatings exhibit good abrasion resistance as verified by the abrasion tests. Finally, the superhydrophobic coating is utilized to fabricate a superhydrophobic stainless-steel mesh on which the oil/water separation can be achieved with high efficiency and low cost.

AB The traditional view holds that glass forming ability decreases with increase of mold temperature. In this study, however, abnormal increase of glass forming ability in high pressure die casting was observed when mold temperature exceeded 413 K. Thermodynamic analysis of interfacial transport reveals that the rising glass forming ability beyond the critical mold temperature is mainly ascribed to the increase of interfacial heat transfer coefficient, which results from a better heat contact between mold and casting due to the elimination of skin effect.

DT Article
DE Decision making under uncertainty; Interval valued; Golden rule;
   Multi-dimensionality; Choquet integral
AB On multiple occasions, suitability of actions depends on uncertain estimation of current situation. In general, we are not certain about a current state of a system, as well as not sure about suitability of a specific action. Observations of a system depends on reliability of obtained measurement, our confidence in them, or simply on availability of all measurements that are required to determine the system's status. At the same time, we are not sure about conditions that should be satisfied for a given actions. In many cases, this is still related to confidence in measurements.
   In the paper, we focus on a problem of determining a decision action based on the observation of multiple variables describing the state of a system. In particular, we address the case where we have some uncertainty in the observed values of the variables. Initially, we consider the situation where our uncertain observations are in a form of granules associated with probabilities. Further, we consider a generalization of the problem in which our random aspect of the uncertainty is replaced by a more general measure-based formulation of uncertainty that requires the use of the Choquet integral.

ID RECOMMENDER SYSTEMS; FACTORIZATION; INFORMATION
AB Context-aware recommender systems (CARS) are specially designed to take into account the contextual conditions under which a user experiences an item, with the goal of generating improved recommendations. A known difficulty when constructing recommender systems is data sparseness, which reduces the effectiveness of collaborative filtering algorithms. While using contextual information provides fine-grained signals for the recommendation process, it makes the data even sparser and increases the computational complexity. In this paper, we present a method for making context-aware recommendations, which is less sensitive to data sparseness. The proposed method exploits the transitivity of the interactions between users and items on the user-item graph to augment the direct interactions, thus reducing the negative effect of sparse data. Based on graph transitivity we introduce a new graph-based association measure that we use as a measure of similarity between two users or two items in nearest neighbor recommendation methods. This combination of graph-based similarity measure with nearest neighbor methods allows considering more contextual conditions at a lower risk of being affected by data sparseness caused by additional contextual dimensions. We experimentally evaluated the proposed method on three contextually-tagged data sets. The results show that our method outperforms several baselines and state-of-the-art context-aware recommendation methods. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Acoustic scene classification has gained great interests in recent years due to its diverse applications. Various acoustic and visual features have been proposed and evaluated. However, few studies have investigated acoustic and visual feature aggregation for acoustic scene classification. In this paper, we investigated various feature sets based on the fusion of acoustic and visual features. Specifically, acoustic features are directly extracted from the waveform: spectral centroid, spectral entropy, spectral flux, spectral roll-off, short-time energy, zero-crossing rate, and Mel-frequency Cepstral coefficients. For visual features, we calculate local binary pattern, histogram of gradients, and moments based on the audio scene time-frequency representation. Then, three feature selection algorithms are applied to various feature sets to reduce feature dimensionality: correlation-based feature selection, principal component analysis, and ReliefF. Experimental results show that our proposed system was able to achieve an accuracy improvement of 15.43% compared to the baseline system with the development set. When all development sets are used for training, the performance based on the evaluation set provided by the TUT Acoustic scene 2016 challenge is 87.44%, which is the fourth best among all non-neural network systems.

AB In many practical machine learning problems, the acquisition of labeled data is often expensive and time consuming. To reduce this labeling cost, active learning has been introduced in many scientific fields. This study considers the problem of active learning of a regression model in the context of an optimal experimental design. Classical optimal experimental design approaches are based on the least square errors of labeled samples. Recently, a couple of active learning approaches that take advantage of both labeled and unlabeled data have been developed based on Laplacian regularized regression models with a single criterion. However, these approaches are susceptible to selecting undesirable samples when the number of initially labeled samples is small. To address this susceptibility, this study proposes an active learning method that considers multiple complementary criteria. These criteria include sample representativeness, diversity information, and variance reduction of the Laplacian regularization model. Specifically, we developed novel density and diversity criteria based on a clustering algorithm to identify the samples that are representative of their distributions, while minimizing their redundancy. Experiments were conducted on synthetic and benchmark data to compare the performance of the proposed method with that of existing methods. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed active learning algorithm outperforms its existing counterparts. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The no-wait flow shop scheduling problem (NWFSP) performs an essential role in the manufacturing industry. In this paper, a factorial based particle swarm optimization with a population adaptation mechanism (FPAPSO) is implemented for solving the NWFSP with the makespan criterion. The nearest neighbor mechanism and NEH method are employed to generate a potential initial population. The factorial representation, which uniquely represents each number as a string of factorial digits, is designed to transfer the permutation domain to the integer domain. A variable neighbor search strategy based on the insert and swap neighborhood structure is introduced to perform a local search around the current best solution. A population adaptation (PA) mechanism is designed to control the diversity of the population and to avoid the particles being trapped into local optima. Furthermore, a runtime analysis of FPAPSO is performed with the level-based theorem. The computational results and comparisons with other stateof-the-art algorithms based on the Reeve's and Taillard's instances demonstrate the efficiency and performance of FPAPSO for solving the NWFSP.

AB Liver segmentation has always been the focus of researchers because it plays an important role in medical diagnosis. However, under the condition of low contrast between a liver and surrounding organs and tissues, CT image noise and the large difference between the liver shapes of patients, existing liver image segmentation algorithms are difficult to obtain satisfactory results. To improve this situation, we propose a liver CT sequesnce image segmentation algorithm GIU-Net, which combines an improved U-Net neural network model with graph cutting. Specifically, we initially segment a liver from a liver CT sequence using an improved U-Net and obtain the probability distribution map of the liver regions. Secondly, the sequence segmentation start slice is selected, and then the context information of the liver sequence images and the liver probability distribution map are used to construct a graph cut energy function. Finally, the segmentation is done by minimizing the graph cut energy function. Our experimental results show that GIU-Net has a good performance when segmenting liver sequence images in terms of segmentation accuracy and robustness. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID CLASSIFIERS
AB In the field of machine learning, the problem of imbalanced classification arises when the class percentage on the data is unevenly distributed. Different strategies using boosting ensemble algorithms have shown improved results over the imbalanced classification problem by combining weak learners to produce a single strong learner. In particular, decision trees are often used as base learners in ensemble learning for classification or regression. However, boosting ensemble algorithms sometimes generate a large number of decision trees that could grow too large to be understandable and interpretable. Additionally, the use of weights adds more complexity to the final result. For this reason, in this paper, we present RuleCOSI, a novel method for combining and simplifying the output of an ensemble of binary decision trees into a single set of production rules. The proposed method takes into account the weight of each decision tree and using a combination matrix generates a single set of simplified production rules with performance comparable to that of the original boosting ensemble. In order to measure the performance and prove the applicability of the proposed method, we carried out an empirical validation using three different boosting algorithms over several well-known machine learning datasets as well as real-life data collected from a manufacturing company. The results of the algorithm are acceptable in most of the experiments reducing the complexity of the boosting ensemble output while maintaining a similar performance. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

AB This paper presents a new approach for ranking organizational units within a benchmarking context. Instead of the conventional optimization-based techniques, the proposed approach uses Social network analysis and Multiobjective optimization concepts to extract second-order features from the input-output data, integrating the resulting multidimensional information using TOPSIS. It shows how several expert and intelligent systems techniques can be harmoniously integrated and applied to performance assessment. The proposed approach has been used for ranking the performance of 27 major US airlines, comparing the results with some existing Data Envelopment Analysis methods. It is shown that the use of a richer information set instead of the raw input-output data leads to an innovative and more effective way of discriminating between efficient units.

AB This paper aims at solving such a group fuzzy comprehensive evaluation (FCE) problem that the global or local ignorance may exist in judgments made by experts and the importance degrees of experts are different. The basic probability assignment (BPA) function is used to extract the expert's judgment information and the super fuzzy relationship matrices consisting of the individual type and the general type are constructed by Shafer's discounting and Dempster's rule. Then each type of super fuzzy relationship matrix is combined with factor weight set via a specified fuzzy operator and the comprehensive evaluation result that is a belief distribution on the power set of grade levels is obtained. A multi-objective programming model is established to compute the optimal belief distribution on each grade level and an algorithm is summarized to derive the final grade level that the evaluated alternative belongs to. Moreover, the numerical comparisons between the proposed method and relevant existing methods are given to clarify the advantages of the proposed method. Finally, an illustrative example is provided to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed method and algorithm. It is worth noting that the proposed method can be easily converted into a core algorithm, which is benefit for developing fuzzy expert system from the perspective of ignorance, and thus it has an important impact and significance on expert and intelligent systems.

AB Multiple criteria decision making (MCDM) methods provide an effective means of assisting decision makers to choose the best alternative given multiple criteria. The VIKOR method, among others, is characterized by a trade-off between the maximum group utility of the majority (aggregation of all criteria) and the minimum individual regret of the opponent (each of criteria). In this paper, we propose a new VIKOR method that makes use of incomplete criteria weights instead of previous weighting methods such as entropy for objective weights, and equal, analytic hierarchy process (AHP), or fuzzy for subjective weights. The proposed VIKOR method ranks alternatives using the aggregated scores of alternatives computed by multiplying the extreme points of a set of criteria weights by the precise or interval consequences of alternatives.
   Further, we show that the VIKOR method combines both the expected opportunity loss and the minimax regret by reinterpreting it in terms of a decision making under uncertainty (DMUU) approach. Therefore, the VIKOR method, a well-known MCDM method, can be used for prioritizing strategies under states of nature. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

To achieve this, three novel fuzzy logic concepts (i.e., relative linguistic labels, high-level rules and linguistic variable weights) were conceived and implemented in a fuzzy logic system for reshoring decision-making. The introduced concepts increase the interpretability of fuzzy rules and reduce the complexity when designing fuzzy rules while still providing accurate results. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Credit risk assessment is considered as one of the vital topics in financial institutions. The existing credit risk evaluation methods are based on black box models or transparent models. The black box models cannot adequately reveal information hidden in the data and the credit risk evaluation remains difficult. In addition, there exist relatively few transparent models that take into consideration interpretability and comprehensibility. To address this problem, we aim to build a reliable credit risk evaluation model which generates a set of classification rules. In fact, we consider the credit risk evaluation as a search-based optimization problem where the goal is to minimize the complexity of the generated solution, to maximize the accuracy, and also to maximize weight which represents rules importance. We conducted a comparative study of four multi-objective evolutionary algorithms in terms of their performance. The obtained results confirm the efficiency of the SMOPSO Algorithm regarding generating classification rules for credit risk assessment. The proposed credit risk evaluation model revealed an attractive trade-off between accuracy and comprehensibility. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID ALGORITHM
AB In this paper, we present a parallel computing solution for an existing outlier mining method (LOMA)-a local outlier detection technique. As datasets increase radically in size, there is a pressing demand to develop highly scalable outlier detection algorithms that leverages modern distributed and parallel computing infrastructures. It is challenging to devise parallel outlier detection techniques, because sharing and accessing global data across multiple computing nodes inevitably impose I/0 overheads. To address this concern, we design a parallel LOMA computing framework called PLOMA, which is composed of three modules, namely, parallel data reduction, local sparse-subspace construction, and sparse-subspace validation. The parallel data reduction module exhibits superb efficiency by the virtue of the sampling technology to compute k nearest neighbor. At the heart of PLOMA is a local sparse-subspace construction module, which extends the discrete particle swarm optimization method to search local sparse subspaces on multiple datanodes in parallel. The validation module allows PLOMA to maintain high mining accuracy by verifying the correctness of the local sparse subspaces obtained by the construction module. Furthermore, PLOMA produces contextual information serving as insightful explanations on detected outliers, thereby achieving high interpretability. We apply PLOMA algorithm to the astronomical spectral data for discovering peculiar celestial objects. Our comprehensive experimental study using a 24-nodes Hadoop cluster confirms that PLOMA achieves high performance in terms of extensibility, scalability, and interpretability. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

AB In our current society, it is very common to have access to a huge amount of information and scenarios in which it is possible to choose among a great number of alternatives. Therefore, systems that automate or assist with the decision-making process are becoming crucial. Those systems should allow users to represent their preferences accurately, even in scenarios where the user has many forms of comparing the available alternatives. In this paper, we propose an argument-based framework for multi-criteria decision-making based on conditional rules, that allows users to encode their preferences among the comparison criteria in terms of requirement and tolerance values. From these rules, arguments that are involved in the comparison process are generated. In order to comply with users' demands for explanations of the given answers, our proposed framework can provide qualitative explanations about the argumentation process, and also an explanatory graph that shows how all the alternatives were ranked and the connections with the user's rules that were used. We also show the results of an empirical analysis of the performance of a developed prototype. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Idiopathic Parkinsons disease (PD) is currently the second most important neurodegenerative disease in incidence. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) constitutes a successful and necessary therapy; however, the continuous stimulation it provides can be associated with multiple side effects. DBS uses an implanted pulse generator that delivers, through a set of electrodes, electrical stimulation to the target area, normally the Sub Thalamic Nucleus. Recently, Closed-loop DBS has emerged as a promising new strategy, where the device stimulates only when necessary, thereby reducing any adverse effects. Here, we present a Closed-loop DBS system for PD, which is able to recognize, with 100% accuracy, when the patient is going to enter into the tremor phase, thus allowing the device to stimulate only in such cases. The expert system has been designed and implemented within the data stream mining paradigm, suitable for our scenario since it can cope with continuous data of a theoretical infinite length and with a certain variability, which uses the synchronization among the neural population within the Sub Thalamic Nucleus as the continuous data stream input to the system.

AB While the increasing average age of population is posing new challenges to societies and healthcare systems, the emergence of the Internet of Things research area is generating the hope for automated assisted environments, which could combine the advances in sensors networks with that of runtime monitoring systems, in order to create smart houses able to take care of their older inhabitants and delay the recourse to hospitals and nursing homes. However, although various assisted living systems have been proposed in the last decade, the goal of realizing an effective domestic support system for elderly is still far from reached.
   In this work, we present a project aiming to re-engineer a set of everyday life objects, equipping them with environmental and wearable sensors, thus to monitor the condition of older people in their domestic residences and provide security while preserving the autonomy and independence of the subjects. The main focus of the paper at hand is on the requirements and solutions implemented to realize the backbone infrastructure of such system as regards both the adopted semantic message routing mechanism and the newly conceived approach to event analysis, which combines Complex Event Processing and a reactive implementation of Event Calculus.

AB Background and objective: The X-ray screening is one of the most popular methodologies in detection of respiratory system diseases. Chest organs are screened on the film or digital file which go to the doctor for evaluation. However, the analysis of x-ray images requires much experience and time. Clinical decision support is very important for medical examinations. The use of Computational Intelligence can simulate the evaluation and decision processes of a medical expert. We propose a method to provide a decision support for the doctor in order to help to consult each case faster and more precisely.
   Methods: We use image descriptors based on the spatial distribution of Hue, Saturation and Brightness values in x-ray images, and a neural network co-working with heuristic algorithms (Moth-Flame, Ant Lion) to detect degenerated lung tissues in x-ray image. The neural network evaluates the image and if the possibility of a respiratory disease is detected, the heuristic method identifies the degenerated tissues in the x-ray image in detail based on the use of the proposed fitness function.
   Results: The average accuracy is 79.06% in pre-detection stage, similarly the sensitivity and the specificity averaged for three pre-classified diseases are 84.22% and 66.7%, respectively. The misclassification errors are 3.23% for false positives and 3.76% for false negatives.
   Conclusions: The proposed neuro-heuristic approach addresses small changes in the structure of lung tissues, which appear in pneumonia, sarcoidosis or cancer and some consequences that may appear after the treatment. The results show high potential of the newly proposed method. Additionally, the method is flexible and has low computational burden. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB There are two main reasons why traditional clustering schemes are incompetent for high-dimensional categorical data. First, traditional methods usually represent each cluster by all dimensions without difference; and second, traditional clustering methods only rely on an individual dimension of projection as an attribute's weight ignoring relevance among attributes. We solve these two problems by a MapReduce-based subspace clustering algorithm (called PUMA) using multi-attribute weights. The attribute subspaces are constructed in our PUMA by calculating an attribute-value weight based on the co-occurrence probability of attribute values among different dimensions. PUMA obtains sub-clusters corresponding to respective attribute subspaces from each computing node in parallel. Lastly, PUMA measures various scale clusters by applying the hierarchical clustering method to iteratively merge sub-clusters. We implement PUMA on a 24-node Hadoop cluster. Experimental results reveal that using multi-attribute weights with subspace clustering can achieve better clustering accuracy on both synthetic and real-world high dimensional datasets. Experimental results also show that PUMA achieves high performance in terms of extensibility, scalability and the nearly linear speedup with respect to number of nodes. Additionally, experimental results demonstrate that PUMA is reasonable, effective, and practical to expert systems such as knowledge acquisition, word sense disambiguation, automatic abstracting and recommender systems.

ID KNOWLEDGE; FRAMEWORK; AGENTS
AB The paper presents a new architecture framework in the field of expert and intelligent systems which is based on four paradigms: a novel multi-agent dynamic system architecture (MADS), an extended Belief Desire Intention (EBDI) agent community, autonomy-oriented entities (AOEs), and deep learning concepts. The main impact of the proposed framework is a new approach, or even a new way of thinking, which enables integration of the concepts of deep learning, a conventional approach to solving the domain problem, cognitive agents with mental attitudes, and concepts of nature-inspired computing. All these allow the effective use of the framework in the field of intelligent and expert systems. The significance of the framework lies in its flexibility and adaptability based on the formal logical description of EBDI agents, the definition of the behaviour of AOEs, the use of classical modules for domain problem solving, and modules based on deep-learning concepts. We believe that the example of the adaptation of the proposed architecture framework to robust multi-face tracking illustrates the significance of the proposed framework. In this paper, MADS is adapted to the first two stages of a face de-identification pipeline: robust face detection and multi-face tracking. The proposed architecture of MADS has a two-level hierarchical organization. At the first level there is a manager designed as an Extended Belief Desire Intention (mEBDI) agent. The extension of a manager BDI agent consists of a convolutional neural network-based face detector, a set of autonomous-oriented entities for the elimination of false positive face detections, and a trajectory memory. At the second level, there are many tracking agents (trEBD1s) which consist of a basic BDI agent extended with a face tracker based on position and scale correlation filters, a visual appearance memory, and a trajectory memory. The mEBDI and trEBDI agents are defined by the modal logic and are described at the implementation level. The proposed architecture for a robust multi-face tracking system was tested on a subset of YouTube music videos. The qualitative results, as well as the preliminary quantitative results expressed by the standard testing metrics, demonstrate the effective adaptation of the proposed multi-agent dynamic architecture to a robust multi-face tracking system.

TI Data clustering using proximity matrices with missing values
SO EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS
LA English
DT Article
DE Clustering; Imputation; Missing values; Proximity matrix
AB In most applications of data clustering the input data includes vectors describing the location of each data point, from which distances between data points can be calculated and a proximity matrix constructed. In some applications, however, the only available input is the proximity matrix, that is, the distances between each pair of data point. Several clustering algorithms can still be applied, but if the proximity matrix has missing values no standard method is directly applicable. Imputation can be done to replace missing values, but most imputation methods do not apply when only the proximity matrix is available. As a partial solution to fill this gap, we propose the Proximity Matrix Completion (PMC) algorithm. This algorithm assumes that data is missing due to one of two reasons: complete dissimilarity or incomplete observations; and imputes values accordingly. To determine which case applies the data is modeled as a graph and a set of maximum cliques in the graph is found. Overlap between cliques then determines the case and hence the method of imputation for each missing data point. This approach is motivated by an application in plant breeding, where what is needed is to cluster new experimental seed varieties into sets of varieties that interact similarly to the environment, and this application is presented as a case study in the paper. The applicability, limitations and performance of the new algorithm versus other methods of imputation are further studied by applying it to datasets derived from three well-known test datasets.

AB The huge diversity and quantity of data and information, and the requirements for knowledge extraction out of them put new challenges for knowledge management, synthesis, conflict detection and reasoning This paper elaborates on the design and development of COSMOS, an intelligent system which supports a) collaboration of experts for developing common knowledge bases and b) diagnosis derivation which takes into account time and uncertainty. The health domain is used for illustration and discussion of the features of our approach. Initially, we present the syntax and the semantics of the rules which incorporate time (temporal rules) and the data items upon which reasoning is performed. Then we introduce its inference engine, able to perform reasoning on top of rules and data, handling also the embedded time and uncertainty. We proceed further to define a conflict detection policy for supporting the difficult and error prone task of rule generation. The complexities of the aforementioned tasks are hidden from users via a well-designed and user friendly web interface that possesses strong collaboration features enabling multiple experts to work on defining a rule and on developing a common knowledge base. Evaluation of COSMOS has been performed using a) students studying expert systems and b) health experts in order to demonstrate the usability of the approach and the considerable advantages gained. To the best of our knowledge, COSMOS is one of the very few systems combining temporal rules, a powerful inference engine handling uncertainty and conflict detection and progresses beyond state of the art by adopting strong collaboration features and paradigms.

AB This paper describes an approach using computational intelligence methods to form a hybrid model as a classification method for 2-lead cardiac arrhythmias. The hybridization of methods can increase the performance in a system and take advantage of the benefits offered by such techniques in solving complex problems. The interpretation of electrocardiograms is a useful task for physicians, but when it comes to reviewing more than 24 h of information, it becomes a laborious task for them. For this reason, the design a computational model that helps in such a task is very useful for the timely medical diagnosis. The hybrid model is build using artificial neural networks and fuzzy logic. Training and testing of the hybrid model was with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Beth Israel Hospital (MIT-BIH) arrhythmia database. The heartbeats are preprocessed to improve results of classification. Ten different classes of normal and arrhythmia signals for building the hybrid model are considered. We used two electrode signals or leads included in the MIT-BIH arrhythmia database, MLII and V1, V2, or V3 as second electrode signal. The hybrid model is composed by two basic module units, as described below. A basic module unit to perform the classification for each signal lead is used. Each basic module unit is composed of three different classifiers based on the following models: fuzzy KNN algorithm, multilayer perceptron with gradient descent and momentum (MLP-GDM), and multilayer perceptron with scaled conjugate gradient backpropagation (MLP-SCG). The outputs from the classifiers are combined using a fuzzy system for integration of results. We designed two fuzzy systems, Mamdani type-1 fuzzy system (type-1 FIS) and an interval type-2 fuzzy system (IT2FIS). The reason is to perform a comparison between type-1 FIS and IT2FIS in the hybrid model. We have obtained best results in the classification rate using IT2FIS instead of type-1 FIS in the basic units. Finally, a type-1 FIS is used to determine the global classification for the 2 basic units in hybrid model. We obtained a good classification rate in each basic module unit, 92.90% and 92.70% of classification rate for basic modules unit 1 and unit 2 respectively. Finally, we obtained a 93.80% when used type-1 FIS and 94.20% of classification rate used IT2FIS combining both basic module units. In the results presented, we improve the global classification in proposed hybrid model combining neural networks and fuzzy logic used both signal lead included in MIT-BIH arrhythmia database. The proposed hybrid model maybe extended to use multi-lead arrhythmia classification using other databases that contain 12 leads to be able to make a complete medical diagnosis.

ID SELECTION PRESSURE; SCHEDULING PROBLEM; PERFORMANCE
AB Computational intelligence methods can provide high-quality solutions to a variety of complex optimization problems where exact analytical solutions are impossible to obtain within a reasonable time and other resources used. The article proposes a novel concept of island model with islands of different sizes as well as differential evolution algorithms implementing this concept. Such a multi-size approach facilitates the design of island-based algorithms and brings a variety of benefits. Among them: improved fitness dynamics throughout the entire time of operation even without migration of solutions among the islands. The absence of migration eliminates the need to establish the topology and the policy of migration. It also makes the efficiency of multi-size island-based algorithms independent of the particular islands' size and practically eliminates the need of tuning the size of islands which is usually done in the case of the canonical island model. All these features indicate the superiority of the proposed multi-size island model over the canonical one. The efficiency of the proposed multi-size approach has been tested by solving one of the most difficult scheduling problems which is the discrete-continuous scheduling with continuous resource discretization.

AB The no-wait flow shop scheduling problem (NWFSP) plays an essential role in the manufacturing industry. Inspired by the overall process of biogeography theory, the standard biogeography-based optimization (BBO) was constructed with migration and mutation operators. In this paper, a hybrid biogeography-based optimization with variable neighborhood search (HBV) is implemented for solving the NWFSP with the makespan criterion. The modified NEH and the nearest neighbor mechanism are employed to generate a potential initial population. A hybrid migration operator, which combines the path relink technique and the block-based self-improvement strategy, is designed to accelerate the convergence speed of HBV. The iterated greedy (IG) algorithm is introduced into the mutation operator to obtain a promising solution in exploitation phase. A variable neighbor search strategy, which is based on the block neighborhood structure and the insert neighborhood structure, is designed to perform the local search around the current best solution in each generation. Furthermore, the global convergence performance of the HBV is analyzed with the Markov model. The computational results and comparisons with other state-of-art algorithms based on Taillard and VRF benchmark show that the efficiency and performance of HBV for solving NWFSP.

AB Surfactant and microwave assisted extraction (S-MAE) was used for pectin extraction from orange peel. First, we optimized the conditions of microwave assisted extraction (MAE), e.g., irradiation time, liquid-to-solid ratio (LSR), and pH on pectin yield (PY), galacturonic acid (GA) content, and degree of esterification (DE) using a Box-Behnken design. Under optimal conditions (pH 1.2, 7.0 min, and 21.5 v/w LSR), we obtained a PY of 28.0 +/- 0.5%, which was close to the predicted value (31.1%). Second, we analyzed the effect of surfactant on microwave extraction of pectin. Among the surfactants investigated, Tween-80 (8 g/L, w/v) increased PY by 17.0%.

AB Seventeen commercial chrysanthemum teas (Chrysanthemum morifolium and Coreopsis tinctoria) were extracted with hot-H2O, and examined and compared to the 75% methanol extracts for their chemical compositions using UPLC/Q-TOF-MS analysis. For the first time, 6, 8-C,C-diglucosylapigenin and eriodicyol-7-O-glucoside were detected in the Snow chrysanthemum, and acetylmarein was detected in HangJu, GongJu and HuaiJu. The extracts were also examined for their radical scavenging and anti-inflammatory activities in vitro. The hot-H2O extract of Kunlunmiju 1 had the greatest total phenolic content, and relative DPPH and oxygen radical absorbance capacity values of 12.72 mg gallic acid equivalents/g, 105.48 and 1222.50 mu mol Trolox equivalents/g, respectively. In addition, all the hot-H2O extracts suppressed the lipopolysaccharide-induced interleukin-6, IL-1 beta and cyclooxygenase-2 mRNA expressions, and H2O2-induced intracellular reactive oxygen species production in cultured cells. The results from this research may be used to promote the consumption of chrysanthemum as a functional tea.

AB Annealing offers a facile and green approach to the modification of starch. This study was the first to investigate the effect of annealing on the properties of waxy rice starch nanoparticles (SNPs). The spherical morphology of SNPs hardly changed after annealing, and the nanoscale size of the SNPs was maintained in the range of 50-120 nm. The relative crystallinity of modified SNPs increased from 53.71% to 63.46% after annealing at 55 degrees C for 48 h. The annealing treatment increased the melting temperature from 78.3 degrees C to 95.7 degrees C, but decreased the melting range from 30.8 degrees C to 25.3 degrees C. The increased 1047 cm(-1):1022 cm(-1) ratio suggested that annealing resulted in an efficient packing of double helices. This work suggests that annealing, a safe and green method, produces modifications which can improve the properties of SNPs and therefore expand their applications in the fields of food, nutraceuticals, and other materials.

AB Coffee has been determined as the dominant source of furan within an adult's diet. This study investigates the influence of coffee condiment use and stirring on the retention of furan. Three condiment lipid compositions were investigated, 0%, 3.5% and 35%, and kept at either 4 degrees C, 20 degrees C or 70 degrees C before addition to a freshly brewed cup of filter coffee which was subsequently mechanically stirred at three intensities, not stirred and moderately or heavily stirred. While five furans were monitored, furan, 2-methylfuran, 3-methylfuran, 2,5-dimethylfuran and 2,3-dimethylfuran, only two were quantifiable: furan and 2-methylfuran. Increasing condiment lipid concentration significantly increased retention of furan and 2-methylfuran, whereas stirring the coffee significantly increased furan release. A condiment temperature of 70 degrees C was found to significantly increase furan release.

AB Rice bran wax (RBW) is a traditional plant based natural wax and an increasingly popular component in textiles, fruit coatings and cosmetics. Properties of RBW can be modified by acyglycerols, and the resulting products can possess features with great potential in different applications. In this study, RBW was interesterified with palm olein (POL) catalyzed by Lipozyme TL IM, and the effects of RBW on the crystallization rate, solid fat content (SFC) and thermodynamic properties were investigated. The crystallization rates of RBW-based enzymatically interesterified (EIE) products were significantly higher than both the starting mixture and fully hydrogenated rapeseed oil (FHRSO). The EIE RBW-based samples were predominantly crystallized in beta' form, and presented a much smoother SFC profile as compared to physically blended raw materials. The SFC values were significantly decreased, conversely increased, and remained constant, and at 10 degrees C, 20-30 degrees C, and 35-40 degrees C as the wax ester and acylglycerols compositions changes. Overall, RBW-based samples after EIE showed an increased hardness and good surface properties, which make it a potential plastic fats substitute.

AB The physicochemical properties of broad bean paste koji made from extruded and traditional steam-cooked raw materials were investigated by scanning electron micrographs (SEM), confocal laser scanning micrographs (CLSM), circular dichroism (CD) and Molecular weight (Mw) analysis. The results showed that the protease activity of koji made from the extruded materials was higher than that of the traditional cooking method. A network porous structure in the extruded samples was observed by SEM. Furthermore, the CLSM results showed that the starch of the extrudate was embedded well in its protein network. CD spectroscopy implied that the alpha-helix decreased while the beta-turn and random coil increased after both treatments. Mw analysis determined that the starch molecules were degraded during extrusion, the proportion of micromolecules was more in the extruded samples than in the steam-cooked samples. However, the chain length distribution of starch exhibited no significant difference between the extruded and steam-cooked broad beans.

AB The disappearance of the C-glycosidic ellagitannins over time can occur even in absence of oxygen and their disappearance rate seems to be affected by the presence of other ellagitannins in the media. The objective of this work was to study the influence of the presence of other ellagitannins and/or oxygen on the individual evolution of the main oak ellagitannins in simple model systems in order to understand their behaviours in more complex media, such as wine. In all the studied conditions, vescalagin disappeared faster than castalagin, highlighting its greater reactivity. Oxygen increased the individual disappearance rate, as also occurred when more than one type of ellagitannin was present, above all if the additional ellagitannin(s) contained the same conformation in C1 as vescalagin. Experimental data were fitted to a kinetic model considering both the oxygen-dependent and oxygen-independent reactions, making possible the comparison between individual compounds in different scenarios.

AB This study presents unpublished data on the chlorogenic acid and caffeic acid content in fruits. Sixty-four fruits consumed in Brazil, most of which were produced domestically, were evaluated based on their levels of 3-caffeoylquinic acid, 4-caffeoylquinic acid, 5-caffeoylquinic acid, 3,4-dicaffeoylquinic acid, 3,5-dicaffeoylquinic acid, 4,5-dicaffeoylquinic acid and caffeic acid. The study investigated 15 fruits that have not been reported in the literature in relation to these compounds, including several native species. The highest concentration of mono-caffeoylquinic acid was observed in strawberry, cherry, bilberry, quince and mulberry, while the dicaffeoylquinic acid was present with highest concentration in kumquat, passion fruit and sweet granadilla. Regarding caffeic acid, the highest content was found in bilberry and yellow pitaya. Considering the sum of the concentrations of these compounds, quince, cherry, bilberry, mulberry and sweet granadilla were exceptional, with concentrations between 200.0 and 569.7 mg kg(-1).

AB Oxidation of wine upon bottle ageing is a crucial matter of concern for the qualitative long-term storage of white wines. However, understanding the various molecular mechanisms potentially involved, which can impact the wine composition, requires that top-down analytical strategies are implemented. Here, we report the analysis of bottle aged Chardonnay wines made from the same must, but differing by the amount of SO2 initially added to the must at pressing (0 and 8 g.h L-1). Metabolomics fingerprints obtained from electrochemical simulation of oxidative reactions were obtained by coupling of either on-line or off-line electrochemical oxidation to FT-ICRMS detection. We reveal that, whatever the electrochemical DC voltage is, wines with initial SO2 addition displayed molecular fingerprints, which remained more similar to the non-oxidized wine without initial SO2 addition. We further show that a diversity of sulfur-containing compounds appeared to be the most sensitive to oxidation, whereas nitrogen-containing compounds were mostly formed.

AB Lipids, particularly phospholipids, are known to play a significant role in the characteristic aroma of the different meat species. Both neutral lipids and phospholipids were extracted from egg yolk and added to minced chicken (1% w/w) prior to cooking in water at 100 degrees C for 20 min. Sensory analysis of the broths showed that the addition of phospholipids significantly increased the chicken meat aroma whereas the addition of neutral lipids did not. GC-MS analysis showed a significant increase in most of the lipid-derived volatile components when the phospholipids were added, especially 2,4-decadienal, which is a characteristic odour impact compound in chicken. There were very few significant changes in the volatile profile when the neutral lipids were added. These data provide direct evidence that the addition of phospholipids can enhance chicken meat aroma, and addition of egg yolk phospholipids could be applied to improve chicken meat aroma.

AB Verjuice is an acidic unfermented unripe grape juice that has recently been proposed as an alternative to vinegar in different food preparations. In this study, pickled cucumber preserves were industrially prepared using two dilutions of verjuice as acidifying agent and compared with the traditional vinegar-pickled samples. Samples were chemically characterized and subjected to sensory analyses using a trained panel and consumers. The different acidifying agents resulted in pickled cucumbers giving different olfactory and gustatory evaluations. No differences in appearance and texture were found. Despite showing chemical and sensory differences, pickles preserved with verjuice and vinegar had similar overall liking scores for visual, olfactory and gustatory aspects. A key feature of pickles prepared with verjuice is their lack of acetic acid potentially conferring them an additional value, suggesting that verjuice represents a viable alternative to vinegar for the production of pickles with distinctive sensorial properties.

AB Germination and sprouting are regulated by the energy status. In the present study, mung bean seeds were treated with adenosine triphosphate and 2,4-dinitrophenol (DNP). The metabolomic changes during development of mung beans under different energy statuses were investigated. In total, 42 metabolites were identified. Principal component analysis revealed that the featured compounds produced in seeds were oleic, linoleic, and succinic acids. Sugars, including maltose, sucrose, and glucose were related to sprouting. Mung bean seeds utilised diverse energy resources and produced higher succinic acid content. Sugars and secondary metabolites accumulated in sprouts. Nitrogen, sugar, and amino acid metabolism pathways contributed to this physiological process. DNP caused an energy deficit, which resulted in the consumption and translation of glucose. Higher contents of other saccharides and amino acids were observed. The transcriptional results further confirmed our metabolic hypothesis. In conclusion, sufficient energy supply is crucial for sprout development and nutritive metabolite synthesis.

AB Three cooking temperatures (72, 80, and 88 degrees C) were applied to two rice genotypes (Puita Inta CL and INOV CL) for preparing quick cooking brown rice. Samples were analyzed for cooking time, color, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), damaged grains, amylose, protein content and extractability, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), X-ray diffraction (XRD), sensory properties, and in vitro digestion. Cooking time was reduced from 23.0-23.6 to 5.5-6.9 min when the highest temperature was applied, depending on genotype. The greatest grain deformation was observed for treatments from Puita Inta CL. XRD showed greater ability of brown rice from Puita Inta CL to gelatinize at 88 degrees C. Appearance, texture, and flavor of quick cooking brown rice prepared at 88 degrees C was inferior to its brown rice counterparts. Starch digestibility decreased by around 20-22% in 88 degrees C-prepared-quick cooking brown rice. Lower digestibility values were determined for 88 degrees C-treated-INOV CL, and were associated with grain integrity.

AB An untargeted metabolomic method based on UPLC-QTOF were used to investigate the differences in coffee brewed by boiled, pour-over and cold-brew methods here. Distinctive separation among the three groups could be seen from principal component analysis and hierarchical clustering analysis. Analysis of variance, fold change and orthogonal projection to latent structures discriminant mode were conducted to find the characteristic potential markers, subsequently, nine potential markers were putatively identified using general chemical databases, and five of them were further confirmed by acquisition of reference standards. This work provides an efficient way for discrimination of coffee brewed by different methods. Interestingly, the result of this work also suggested that the contents of two selected markers, norharman and harman, were higher in the pour-over and boiled methods, compared to the cold-brew method. This content difference were further verified by the quantitative analysis data of commercial coffee samples.

AB Phenolic and nitrogenous compounds from different styles craft beers were identified by high performance liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry in order to stratify beer samples according to their style. For this, an exploratory assessment relying on Linear Discriminant Analysis was performed. Fifty-seven phenolic compounds were reported and twelve of them were found for the first time in beer: benzoic acids, 2,4-dihydroxybenzoic acid, 2,3-dihydroxybenzoic acid, dimethoxybenzoic acid; phenolic acid conjugates, 3-p-coumaroylquinic acid, 4-p-coumaroylquinic acid, 3-feruloylquinic acid, 4-feruloylquinic acid, 5-feruloylquinic acid; flavonoids, taxifolin hexoside, quercetin dihexoside, apigenin-6,8-dipentoside, and isofraxidin hexoside. Additionally, 11 nitrogenous compounds belonging to the phenolamide class were found. Two discriminant functions were generated and allowed a satisfactory separation among all beer styles. 3-Caffeoylquinic acid, 3-p-coumaroylquinic acid, 4-p-coumaroylquinic acid, 5-caffeoylquinic acid, coumaric acid, kaempferol-3-O-rutinoside, proanthocyanidin B dimer III and proanthocyanidin B dimer V were the compounds that showed the highest capacity of discriminate the beer styles (IPA, Lager and Weiss).

AB A novel, yeast-like fungal strain, Aureobasidium melanogenum TN3-1, that was isolated from natural honey can actively transform 140.0 g/L of glucose into 110.29 +/- 2.17 g/L of pullulan during fermentation, whereas A. melanogenum P16 and TN1-2 converted 140.0 g/L of glucose into only 45.81 +/- 1.7 g/L and 48.7 +/- 2.6 g/L of pullulan, respectively. It was noted that most of the cells in the culture of the strain TN3-1 were arthroconidia, while all of the yeast-like fungal cells of A. melanogenum P16 cultivated under the same conditions were blastoconidia. The cell sizes, cell walls and the number of small vacuoles of A. melanogenum TN3-1 were also much larger, thicker and higher, respectively, than those of A. melanogenum P16. The glycerol, trehalose and glycogen content in the A. melanogenum TN3-1 cells was higher than that of the A. melanogenum P16 and TN1-2 cells.

AB The crude polysaccharide was extracted from hawthorn (Crataegus pinnatifida Bunge. Var. major) and a salt-eluted polysaccharide (SPS-2) was fractionated by DEAE cellulose-52 chromatography. Monosaccharide composition and Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) analysis indicated that the SPS-2 contained 72.3% galacturonic acid and may be pectin. The results of antiglycation activity in vitro showed that the medium molecular weight pectin oligosaccharide (MM-POS) had the highest antiglycation activity among SPS-2 degradation products. Moreover, the MM-POS obtained by enzymatic degradation had stronger antiglycation activity than that by ultrasonic assisted enzymatic degradation. Composition analysis of MM-POS obtained from ultrasound-assisted enzymatic degradation showed that polygalacturonans content decreased from 85.1% to 61.9% but the arabinan and rhamnogalacturonans increased from 10.6% to 22.7% and from 3.5% to 13.2%, respectively, compared to the MM-POS obtained from enzymatic degradation. This study will provide a theoretical basis for the application of POSs in the food field, especially the exploitation of antiglycation agents.

AB Curcumin is a phenolic compound produced by some plants, among which Curcuma longa is the reachest in this principal curcuminoid. At elevated temperature curcumin degrades to trans-6-(4'-hydroxy-3'-methoxyphenyl)-2,4-dioxo-5-hexenal, vanillin, ferulic acid and feruloylmethane, however, the formation of feruloyloacetone ((5E)-6-(4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenyl)hex-5-ene-2,4-dione) in the curcumin degradation process has not been reported yet. As results from experiments, even 28.8% or 20.6% of the degraded curcumin is transformed to feruloyloacetone during 2 h heating of alkaline or acidic curcumin solution, respectively. The structure of the identified feruloyloacetone was confirmed by MSn, HRMS and NMR data. The presented results are important for food processing as feruloyloacetone is formed during food products preparation and its biological activity has not been fully recognized.

AB The concentration of tetramethylpyrazine (TMP) in vinegar is an active indicator of vinegar quality. Dispersive liquid-liquid microextraction (DLLME) was first applied to vinegar as a clean-up pre-treatment for the rapid (5 min) determination of TMP by high-pressure liquid chromatography with ultraviolet detection (HPLC-UV), and may serve as an alternative to solid-phase extraction (SPE) or solid-phase microextraction (SPME). High sensitivity of HPLC for TMP determination was obtained using the DLLME pretreatment, with a limit of detection (LOD) of 0.001 mg L-1 and limit of quantification (LOQ) of 0.005 mg L-1. The developed method exhibited excellent linearity in the concentration range of 0.050-80.000 mg L-1, with a correlation coefficient R-2 > 0.999. Furthermore, the percentage recovery of TMP in vinegar using the developed method was within the range 97.97-105.24%. Therefore, DLLME coupled with HPLC-UV is a sensitive and promising method for vinegar clean-up and TMP assay.

AB Vaccinium bracteatum Thunb. leaves (VBTL) are used to juicing and dye rice to produce 'Wu mi', which displays a deep blue color. However, little information is known about the formation mechanism of the pigments. In this research, non-targeted metabolic profiling of VBTL and VBTL juice samples at different growth stages was studied for searching the pigment precursors through UPLC-QToF-MS and multivariate data analysis. The results showed the L* and b* values of 'Wu mi' produced by spring leaves (stages of 2WAB, 4WAB and 6WAB) were significantly lower than other growth stages. Principal component analysis (PCA) and partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) of the VBTL and VBTL juice samples showed distinct classifications. Further variable importance in projection (VIP) plot in PLS-DA model demonstrated the discriminatory potential biomarkers between VBTL and VBTL juice samples. Some of the identified biomarkers were tentatively identified as the precursor compounds of the iridoid-derived pigments.

AB Many packaged goods undergo transition metal-catalyzed oxidative spoilage. Recently, a nonmigratory photocurable metal-chelating coating was developed as an innovative active packaging approach to control oxidation of foods. In the present study, we investigate the influence of competing ions and increasing viscosity on the iron-chelating capacity and antioxidant efficacy of this coating in a model complex food system. The addition of calcium and magnesium causes a decrease in iron chelating capacity; however, 61% chelating capacity of materials was retained when 0.8 M sodium was present. Materials retained iron-chelating capacity even in solutions of 2700 cP, similar to the viscosity of salad dressing. Additionally, metal-chelating films significantly delayed transition metal-catalyzed ascorbic acid degradation, even in the presence of competing ions and at increased viscosity. These results suggest that metal-chelating active packaging coatings may present a new technological approach to addressing consumer demands for reduced additive use while controlling food spoilage and waste.

AB In this study, variations in basic chemical constitutes, organic acids (OAs), free amino acids (FAAs) and free fatty acids (FFAs) during ripening of raw sheep's milk Tulum cheeses in goat's skin bag (GST) or plastic barrel (PBT) were investigated. Ripening in goat's skin caused the differences in chemical compositions of Tulum cheese. Moisture loss, salt-in-moisture, fat and protein contents increased. No residual lactose was observed after 90 day. Lactic acid was principal organic acid, followed by propionic acid, acetic acid, formic acid, succinic acid and citric acid. The majority of amino acids were composed of Val, Pro, Tyr, Met, Leu, Trp, Phe, Lys and Glu. Hexadecanoic acid was the most abundant free fatty acid in the cheeses, which followed by cis-9-octadecenoic, octadecanoic, tetradecanoic, decanoic and trans-9-octadecenoic acids. The levels of total FFA and total OA were higher in GST-cheese in comparison to PBT-cheese but total FAAs were lower.

AB In this study, a large-scale preparation of jasmine floral volatile condensate (FVC) was conducted using fresh flowers without any extraction solvent involvement. Condensate volatile profiles were compared to those of fresh flowers for their scent characteristics and ability to withstand manufacturing and storage. The FVC possessed a typical jasmine flower scent, a similar odor polygon shape and greatly enhanced odor intensity and character odorants linalool, indole, and methyl anthranilate. In late August and September in Fuzhou, China, the ratio of odor activity values for indole/linalool in FVCs was close to that of fresh flowers, indicating that these were suitable local harvest times for FVC preparation. Room temperature storage for 30 months dramatically reduced the abundance of potent odorants and FVC scent intensity, while cold temperature (4 degrees C) storage was able to maintain FVC clarity and scent intensity. Our findings should be helpful at improving FVC quantity, quality, and storage.

AB Two polysaccharide fractions sequentially extracted with water 1W and alkali 1A, were isolated from the hazelnut skins. The monosaccharide composition together with the FTIR and NMR analyses, indicated that both fractions are formed from a mixture of polysaccharides. The fraction 1W consists of methyl-esterified pectic polysaccharide with rhamnogalacturonan I blocks, branching with arabinose side chains, and with 1,5-, 1,3,5-arabinan and galactan polysaccharides. The fraction 1A is a mixture of deesterified rhamnogalacturonan I and 1,5-, 1,3,5-arabinan and 4-O-Me-glucuronoxylan polysaccharides. The presence of unsaturated galacturonic acid and the heterogeneity of the molecular weights, which Mw ranged between 3.6 and 39 kg mol(-1), indicated the pectin degradation during roasting.

AB An in-situ chemical reaction based dispersive procedure termed as CO2-effervescence assisted emulsification microextraction was first utilized for pre-concentration of Sudan dyes in spices. It is simple, quick, and efficient; based on a switchable fatty acid (hexanoic acid, pK(a) similar to 4.8). The extraction agent is able to be switched into hydrophobic/hydrophilic forms in pH-changeable media, leading to facile and effective dispersion and phase's separation. The method was proved by the analysis of spiked samples. Optimization was statistically performed, resulted in maximum extraction efficiencies. Under optimal conditions, method validation was assayed in the aqueous solutions. Wide linearity with high R-2 values and low detection limits (1-5 ng mL(-1)) were obtainable. Also, enrichment factors were 62-66 with proper repeatability (% RSDs < 6.8, n= 3). Good validations in terms of recovery (86.6-104.5%) and repeatability (% RSDs < 7.8, n=3, C=15 and 30 mu g g(-1)) in foodstuffs confirmed a great effectiveness of the method in complex matrices.

AB In current research, a sensitive screen printed electrochemical sensor on the basis of La3+-doped Co3O4 nanocubes was fabricated to determine sudan I. The electrochemical performance of sudan I at this sensor was investigated in detail, presenting that this sensor had electrocatalytic behavior for oxidizing sudan I due to the significant peak current enhancement and the dropping of oxidation overpotential. Under the optimum conditions, the linear response range for sudan I concentrations by the modified sensor was 0.3-300.0 mu M, and detection limit was 0.05 mu M. Lastly, the suggested technique was also studied as a selective, easy, and exact electrochemical sensor to determine sudan I in food samples, including chili powder, tomato paste, and ketchup sauce.

AB Dextran-containing sourdoughs have been widely employed in baking, obtaining products with higher quality instead of adding additives. This study investigated effects of dextran of a high weight-average molecular weight (M-w) and linear structure, sourdough and their combination on wheat bread quality. The underlying mechanism was explored from properties of pasting, amylopectin retrogradation and water distributions of starch systems. Bread characteristic analyses showed that both dextran and weak acidification due to addition of sourdough improved bread quality, especially crumb softness. Dextran decreased moisture migration due to high waterbinding capacity. Enhancements of amylose aggregation by weak acidification contributed to retardation of amylopectin recrystallization. A synergy existed between dextran and weak acidification. Dough rheology demonstrated that weak acidification was fundamental for dextran-induced positive dough viscoelasticity. This study indicates a combined anti-firming performance of high M-w dextran and weak acidification, possibly being a promising strategy to prolong shelf life of wheat bread.

AB The aim of this research was to study the potential of malolactic fermentation to modify the composition of the juices of sea buckthorn, chokeberry and lingonberry. Juices were prepared with and without pectinolytic enzyme treatment, followed by fermentation with commercially available strains of Lactobacillus plantarum, originally isolated from fermented plant materials. The juices before and after the fermentation were analyzed with GC-FID, HPLC-DAD, and HPLC-MS. Enzyme treatment significantly increased the phenolic content in the juices by 11-50%. None of strains showed ability to ferment lingonberry juice. On the other hand, L. plantarum DSM 10492 and DSM 20174 converted all malic acid to lactic acid in sea buckthorn and chokeberry juices, respectively. Fermentation with DSM 10492 reduced the content of flavonols by 9-14% and hydroxycinnamic acids by 20-24% in chokeberry juice. Flavonol glycosides and sugars in sea buckthorn as well as anthocyanins in chokeberry remained unaffected by the fermentation.

AB The digestion behaviours of pasteurized and UHT homogenized milks were investigated in in vivo rat stomach and in an in vitro dynamic human gastric simulator. The formation of coagulum under gastric conditions and the protein digestion profiles were similar in both systems. UHT milk formed curds with fragmented and crumbled structures, compared with the more cohesive curds formed from unheated or pasteurized milk. UHT milk had faster rates of protein hydrolysis and of the release of fat globules during digestion. These results are attributed to the differences in the structures of the curds formed from the samples with different treatments. The fragmented and crumbled structure of the curds obtained from UHT milk was probably the result of beta-lactoglobulin binding with casein micelles during processing, which sterically hindered aggregation of the casein micelles under gastric conditions. This study provides knowledge for understanding the gastric emptying and digestion of processed consumer milk.

AB Gray mold caused by Botrytis cinerea is a major postharvest disease of table grapes that leads to enormous economic losses during storage and transportation. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of fulvic acid on controlling gray mold of table grapes and explore its mechanism of action. The results showed that fulvic acid application significantly reduced downy blight severity in table grapes without exhibiting any antifungal activity in vitro. Fulvic acid induced phenylpropanoid metabolism, as evidenced by accumulation of phenolic compounds and flavonoids, higher activities of phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL), cinnamate-4-hydroxylase (C4H) and 4-coumarate-CoA ligase (4CL), up-regulation of genes related to phenylpropanoid biosynthesis (PAL, C4H, 4CL, STS, ROMT and CHS). Our results suggested that fulvic acid induces resistance to B. cinerea mainly through the activation of phenylpropanoid pathway and can be used as a new activator of plant defense responses to control postharvest gray mold in table grapes.

AB Avermectins (AVMs) are a group of anti-parasitic agents that have been widely used in food-producing animals. To monitor the residue of the AVMs, an indirect competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ic-ELISA) was developed with a simple sample preparation procedure. Conjugates of 4 ''-HS-IVM/AVM on three different proteins were used to raise a broad-spectrum monoclonal antibody (mAb), 6D4, that had IC50 values for avermectin, ivermectin, eprinomectin and emamectin of 7.2, 10.4, 19.8 and 20.8 mu g L-1, respectively. The limit of detection and limit of quantitation of this method for AVMs in various matrix samples ranged from 0.5 to 5.4 mu g L-1 and 1.0 to 10.3 mu g L-1, respectively. The recoveries of the samples spiked with AVMs were in the range of 78.1-110.5% with coefficients of variation below 14%. The ic-ELISA was applied to monitor ivermectin in the milk samples, and the results showed a good correlation with that of HPLC-MS/MS.

AB This study aimed to determine the changes in the flavor profile during different operating units when making cold-smoked Spanish mackerel. Sensory evaluation and instrumental analysis of tenderness were applied to optimize the processing parameters. For the overall odor perception, distinct odor among fresh and processed samples could be distinguished using electronic nose (e-Nose). Purge-and-trap (P&T) extraction combined with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) was used to identify volatile compounds. Alcohols were the major volatiles in Spanish mackerel over the whole processing, while 2-butanol was found in the highest concentration. Curing was an effective way to remove fishy odor. Drying decreased the concentration of volatiles, especially sulfur compounds. Odor formation in cold-smoked mackerel could be divided into four steps (curing, drying, cold smoking and heating) as a result of partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA).

AB Acrylamide and phenolic compounds on both fresh and cooked olives were monitored by HPLC/MS-MS and reversed-phase-HPLC methods along different procedures: elaboration process, high hydrostatic pressure (HHP), cooking treatment and bioavailability evaluation. Acrylamide was not detected during the elaboration process and after HHP treatment. Hydroxytyrosol, tyrosol, oleuropein and verbascoside were the most important phenols after HHP treatment. The frying and baking processes on olives enhanced the formation of acrylamide and a significant reduction in the phenolic compounds. The frying process produced lower acrylamide concentration and less reduction of phenolic compounds than the baking process, while in the gastrointestinal digestion these compounds were slightly reduced if compared to the initial stage. As a conclusion, the best way to ingest high quantities of phenols and reduce acrylamide consumption is by ingesting the olives when they are fresh. In case the olives need to be cooked, specific time and temperature conditions shall be applied.

AB One interesting phenomenon of Chrysanthemum morifolium tea is its formation of green or dark green color after hours of brewing. We investigated the greening reaction and its bioactivities, including an analysis of the green compounds. Results showed that the green color was due to a decrease in the L* (lightness), b* (yellowness/blueness), chroma values and an increase in hue angle. The green substances were found to be substances with similar polarities and unstable in acidic conditions. There was no significant difference (p < 0.01) in antioxidant activity between non-green and green samples. The green substances did not lead to cytotoxicity in PC12 cells at low concentrations, but at high concentrations, they caused a significant (p < 0.01) decrease in cell viability. The saccharide percentage and FT-IR results showed that the greening reaction was affected by the glycosides or groups attached to the saccharides, which might suggest a new mechanism for color-forming reactions.

ID ANTIOXIDANT ACTIVITY; SHERRY; EVOLUTION; COLOR
AB Brandy de Jerez is the most produced spirit in Spain. The rules of its Regulatory Council require the spirit to age in American oak casks that have previously contained any kind of sherry wine. This use, called seasoning, releases wine compounds into the spirit. Because of the differences among sherries, the organoleptic features of a brandy will be significantly different from any other depending on the seasoning. In addition, its specific features make it different from any other spirit. The chromatographic profiles of Brandy de Jerez are reported to be different depending on the seasonings through their ageing process. Different types of Brandy de Jerez have been characterised, regarding their seasoning, using chromatographic techniques. Applying statistical analysis, correlations between the chromatographic profiles and the seasonings have risen up. In addition, the profiles have demonstrated to possess a high degree of correlation with the ageing time of the samples.

AB Zearalenone is a contaminant in food and feed products which are hazardous to humans and animals. This study explored the feasibility of the Raman rapid screening technique for zearalenone in contaminated maize. For representative Raman spectra acquisition, the ground maize samples were collected by extended sample area to avoid the adverse effect of heterogeneous component. Regression models were built with partial least squares (PLS) and compared with those built with other variable selection algorithms such as synergy interval PLS (siPLS), ant colony optimization PLS (ACO-PLS) and siPLS-ACO. SiPLS-ACO algorithm was superior to others in terms of predictive power performance for zearalenone analysis. The best model based on siPLS-ACO achieved coefficients of correlation (R-p) of 0.9260 and RMSEP of 87.9132 mu g/kg in the prediction set, respectively. Raman spectroscopy combined multivariate calibration showed promising results for the rapid screening large numbers of zearalenone maize contaminations in bulk quantities without sample-extraction steps.

AB beta-Casein, a phosphoprotein representing 37% of the bovine milk caseins, has specific features promoting its application as a nanocarrier for hydrophobic bioactives. In this study, the interactions of beta-casein with curcumin and vitamin D3 under the same physico-chemical conditions were investigated. The interaction kinetics have been studied by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) and fluorescence spectroscopy. The KD value for curcumin-beta-casein interaction has been successfully evaluated (4.1 +/- 0.7 x 10(-4) M) using SPR by fitting data to a 1:1 Langmuir interaction model. Conversely, the SPR responses obtained for vitamin D3 show that the interactions between this hydrophobic compound and the beta-casein immobilized on the sensor chip were below the sensitivity of the SPR apparatus. Moreover, the fluorescence quenching data show that curcumin has higher affinity to beta-casein (K-A = 23.5 +/- 1.9 x 10(4) M-1) than vitamin D3 (K-A = 5.8 +/- 1.1 x 10(4) M-1).

Here, we analysed the accuracy of three models for the non-destructive determination of amylose content. The models were developed by combining near-infrared spectra, colour, and physicochemical information relative to 832 brown rice samples from ten varieties produced between 2009 and 2017 in various regions of Hokkaido, Japan. Models describing low and ordinary amylose varieties were developed individually, merged, and validated using production year samples (2016-2017) different from the calibration set (2009-2015). The resulting accuracy was suitable for industrial application. With standard error of prediction = 0.70% and ratio of performance deviation = 3.56, the combination of near-infrared spectra and physicochemical information produced the most robust model, enabling more precise rice quality screening at grain elevators.

AB The molecular dynamics of the Pseudomonas fluorescens 07A metalloprotease in the presence of structural Ca2+ and Mn2+ ions was evaluated. Seven Ca2+ ions are primarily bound to the C-terminus, while a divalent cation is located at the catalytic site, acting as a cofactor. The observed enzyme's experimental activity suggests that Mn2+ could compete for the active site of the enzyme with Ca2+, Zn2+ or other divalent cations, thus providing greater catalytic power to the enzyme. Our molecular dynamics simulations suggest that these ions partially protect the enzyme's structure from thermal denaturation. Moreover, our simulations have shown a collective movement of opening-closing of the active-site in simulations with structural Ca2+ and Mn2+ ions bound, leading to a proposal of a dynamical model of P. fluorescens 07A metalloprotease active and inactive conformations. These findings can support the development of measures to control the activity of P. fluorescens and other spoilage microorganism proteases.

AB A convenient assay platform comprising a PET/paper chip (PP-chip) and a smart analytical device is developed for detection of sulphur dioxide (SO2) concentration. In the presented approach, the distilled SO2 solution is dropped onto the detection region of the PP-chip and undergoes a reaction with an acid-based reagent. The resulting color variation is analyzed through a high-resolution camera (CMOS) and the reacted image is processed by a RGB (red, green and blue) analytical app installed on a smartphone. Results show that the known SO2 concentrations ranging from 10 to 300 ppm indicate that the high linear relationship (R-2=0.9981) between the (R (red) + G (green) - B (blue)) value and SO2 concentration. Moreover, a high measurement resolution is equal to 1.45 ppm/a.u. The presented assay platform was proved to detect the SO2 concentrations of twenty-five practical food samples. Compared with the developed assay platform and certified inspection technique, the deviation of SO2 measurement does not exceed 3.82%. It was satisfactory to apply this developed assay platform to analyze the SO2 concentration in the practical samples.

AB Benzenethiols are a class of flavoring ingredients used in the food, pharmaceutical, cosmetics and chemical industries. A rapid and visible colorimetric fluorescent probe was developed for the detection of benzenethiol flavors. It provides rapid quantitative detection of benzenethiols at low levels, down to a limit of 10 nM. Test paper containing the probe changes color according to benzenethiol concentration (from colorless to pink, visible with the naked eye). The probe was also successfully used to test benzenethiol concentrations in real food samples. This study demonstrates that this novel probe can be employed as a benzenethiol testing tool.

AB The effects of exogenous progesterone (PROG) on chilling injury (CI) in postharvest banana fruit were investigated. Concentration screening tests showed that 10(-5) mol/l PROG was most effective in reducing CI in banana fruit stored for 25 d at 5 +/- 1 degrees C, but did not markly increase PROG content of pulps. This PROG treatment significantly reduced the electrolyte leakage, levels of malondialdehyde, O2(center dot-) production rate and H2O2 contents in banana compared with control fruit. The PROG treatment caused an early induction of alternative oxidase (AOX) at the transcript and protein level to reduce the generation of O2(center dot-) and H2O2. PROG treatment also enhanced the transcript levels and activities of antioxidant enzymes and maintained higher levels of reduced glutathione and ascorbic acid than the control fruit. These results suggested that PROG attenuating CI in banana fruit may be attributed to the induction of AOX and the improvement of enzyme and non-enzymatic antioxidant defenses.

AB Consumption and global utilization of mandarins is on the rise due to its easy-to-peel attribute compared to other citrus fruits. Mandarins are irradiated as an effective phyto-sanitary treatment for trade requirements. In this study, mandarins were irradiated with 0.4 and 1 kGy electron-beam as approved by United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), and changes in microbial and physicochemical characteristics during storage were monitored at 4 degrees C for 15 d. Microbial proliferation during storage was noticeable in non-irradiated fruits, whereas irradiated mandarins showed dose-dependent inhibition up to 15 d. Irradiation did not affect its moisture, total phenolics, and vitamin C. However, hardness, organic acids, hesperidin, radical scavenging activity, reducing and free sugars significantly decreased in all samples after 5 d of storage. Although, irradiation at 0.4 and 1 kGy could not prevent changes in stored mandarins, 0.4 kGy did not affect the major constituents and physical quality of mandarins, while providing microbial decontamination.

AB The effect of Aloe vera (AV) gel (at 50% or 100%) alone or enriched with Fagonia indica (FI) plant extract at 1% on physiological and biochemical responses of sapodilla fruit were studied during storage at 20 degrees C for 12 days. Sapodilla fruit treated with AV 100% and FI 1% significantly reduced weight loss, decay incidence, soluble solids concentration, and kept a high level of firmness and titratable acidity compared to the untreated fruit. FI 1% added to AV 50% or AV 100% efficiently maintained higher ascorbic acid, total flavonoids, total phenolics and radical scavenging activity of sapodilla fruit. The panelists did not detect any negative effect of AV gel and FI plant extract on the sensory attributes of sapodilla fruit. Therefore, the addition of FI plant extract to AV gel coating could be a promising approach to prolong the shelf life and preserve the quality of sapodilla fruit during storage.

AB This study investigated how the quality of avocado oil is affected by the fruit ripening stage and peeling, and the drying process used. Expeller pressed avocado oils were obtained from unripe or ripe pitted avocados after drying peeled or unpeeled pulps by convection oven, microwave or freeze-drying. Oils from the unpeeled microwave dried pulp (from unripe or ripe avocados) showed the highest induction period (54.2-83.6 h) and antioxidant capacity (4.07-5.26 mmol TE/kg), and high amounts (mg/100 g) of alpha-tocopherol (11.6-21.0), beta-carotene (0.49-0.65) and chlorophyll (44.3-54.0), and unsaponifiable matter (2.48-2.99 g/100 g). Pulp drying process and avocado (un)peeling were the major contributors to the induction period (R-2=0.61; p=0.0139) and antioxidant capacity (R-2=0.62; p=0.011), and the oils from microwave dried unpeeled pulp were those that presented the best performance. The phenolic composition of these oils improved with ripening and keeping the peel during the pressing process.

AB The beta-galactosidase from Aspergillus oryzae produces galactooligosaccharides with beneficial prebiotic effects through the transglycosylation of lactose. However, its low galactooligosaccharide yield greatly limits its use in industrial applications. Rational design and site-directed mutagenesis were used to produce three mutants of A. oryzae beta-galactosidase: N140C, W806F, and N140C/W806F. The galactooligosaccharide yields of N140C (50.7%), W806F (49.3%), and N140C/W806F (59.8%) represent substantial improvements over that of the wildtype (35.7%). The galactooligosaccharide yield of N140C/W806F is the highest reported to date. Our rational design approach suggests novel strategies for further study of the beta-galactosidase reaction mechanism and has produced mutants may be more useful in industrial applications than wild-type A. oryzae beta-galactosidase.

AB The omega-3-fatty acid, docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) 22:6 n-3, is an important food component for the visual and brain development of infants. In this study two approaches have been explored for the encapsulation of DHA in the pH dependant polymer hydroxyl-propyl-methyl-cellulose-acetate-succinate (HPMCAS). In the first approach Direct Spray Drying (DSD) was implemented for the microencapsulation of DHA/HPMCAS organic solutions, whilst in the second approach solid lipid nanoparticle (SLN) dispersions of DHA, were first produced by high-pressure homogenization, prior to being spray dried in HPMCAS aqueous solutions. The DSD approach resulted in significantly higher quantities of DHA being encapsulated, at 2.09 g/100 g compared to 0.60 g/100 g in the spray-dried SLNs. The DHA stability increased with the direct spray-drying approach. Release studies of DHA in the direct sprayed dried samples revealed a lag time for 2 h in acidic media followed by rapid release in phosphate buffer (pH 6.8).

AB The study aimed at assessing effects of freeze-dried Japanese quince fruit (FJQF; 0-9%) added to cookies to improve their antioxidant attributes during storage, sensory and volatile characteristics and acceptability by consumers. Cookies containing FJQF had 2-3.5-fold higher radical scavenging activity and exhibited less secondary lipid oxidation products compared with the control cookies. Enriched cookies had higher contents of volatile hexanal, heptanal, octanal, 2-heptenal, (E) than control cookies. Acetic acid dominated in the volatile profile of enriched cookies (ranging 7.05-23.37%), hence intensities of acidic and citrus aroma were scored high. Cookies stored for 16-weeks showed increased amounts of hydrocarbons as compared with fresh cookies and new hydrocarbons were also generated, which were not detected in fresh cookies. The consumer panel indicated a higher preference for cookies containing 1.0 and 1.5% FJQF than those containing 6.0 and 9.0%.

AB In this study, bighead carp (Aristichthys nobilis) were exposed to waterborne Cr6+ of 0.01, 0.1, 1 and 5 mg/L for 14 days and subsequently transferred to clean water for another 14 days. The Cr6+ contents in some edible parts, such as dorsal muscle, ventral muscle and head were detected. The Cr6+ concentrations in the three parts were in the order of: head > ventral muscle > dorsal muscle with significant increase during exposure period and remarkable decrease when kept at clean water during depuration stage. The head contained higher fat than that of muscle and the Cr6+ levels of these parts showed significantly positive correlation with fat content, however, the Cr6+ contents in the separated fat were extremely low. The Cr6+ levels determined in tissues can tell a real story rather than the correlation coefficient. Fish head poses a higher potential health risk than muscle due to heavy metals pollution.

AB Rapid analytical methods for screening irradiated foods are required to comply with the approved standards for international trade. Dried shrimps irradiated at 1-7 kGy with gamma rays, electron beam (E-beam), and X-rays were screened with an electronic nose (E-nose) and electronic tongue (E-tongue). The data were compared with those from European standard methods (photostimulated luminescence, PSL) and direct epifluorescent filter technique/aerobic plate count, DEFT/APC). All irradiated shrimp samples were clearly discriminated from the non-irradiated control based on PSL photon count measurements and DEFT/APC microbial enumeration. The volatile patterns and taste attributes of the irradiated (> 1 kGy from three sources) and control samples could be distinguished by the E-nose and E-tongue analyses through principal component analysis. Verification through electron spin resonance and thermoluminescence analyses validated screening results. The results indicate that E-sensing techniques showed potential for the rapid screening of irradiated foods like dried shrimps.

AB The formation and properties of nanostructures during food processing have attracted much attention in recent years. Herein, the formation and physicochemical properties of fluorescence carbon dots (CDs) from baked lamb at different baking temperatures (200, 300, and 350 degrees C) were investigated. The morphology, surface functional groups and fluorescent quantum yield of the CDs were found to be highly dependent on the heating temperature. Biocompatibility of CDs investigation indicated that they were able to disperse onto both the cell membrane and the cytoplasm of HepG2 cells, and alter the cell cycle progression slightly. Moreover, the CDs from baked lamb of 350 degrees C showed the maximum scavenging capability to free radicals and could protect the cell from oxidative damage in vitro. This contribution represents the first report regarding the properties and formation process of CDs in baked lamb, providing valuable insights into baking temperature influence on physicochemical properties of the CDs.

AB Developing reliable tools to trace food origin represents a major goal for producers and control authorities. Here, we test the hypothesis whether NGS-generated data could provide a reliable tool to ensure seafood traceability. As a test case, we used the Manila clam Ruditapes philippinarum, a bivalve mollusk of high commercial interest with worldwide distribution, collected in the Venice lagoon sites subjected to prohibition of clam harvesting because of chemical contamination as well as in authorized clam harvesting areas. The results obtained demonstrated that the geographic origin of Manila clam may be more accurately determined basing on microbiome data than single nucleotide polymorphisms. In particular, combining microbiome data with machine-learning techniques, we provide the experimental evidence that it is possible to trace the clam place of origin at high spatial resolution. Considering its low cost and portability, NGS-analysis of microbiome data might represent a cost-effective, high-resolution tool for reliable food traceability.

AB Chinese olive is served as a famous fruit and traditional herb in China. In this study, the anti-neuroinflammatory and antioxidant phytochemicals of Chinese olive fruits were investigated. Three new phenylpropanoids (2, 6, 19), together with sixteen known congeners, have been isolated and identified. A variety of bioactivities related to the traditional healthy benefits of Chinese olive, including anti-neuroinflammatory, antioxidant and antidiabetic, have been evaluated for the identified compounds. The phenylpropanoids could significantly inhibit the production of nitric oxide induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in microglia cells (BV-2). Compounds 2, 6, and 19 could dose-dependently reduce the expression levels of pro-inflammatory mediator iNOS and COX-2 expressions induced by LPS in BV-2 cells. Meanwhile, some phenylpropanoids showed remarkable antioxidant and antidiabetic activities. This study suggested that Chinese olive could be served as a healthy product for neuroinflammatory related diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease.

AB The mean intake (500 mg/day) of branched chain fatty acids (BCFA) in western countries is from dairy products and beef. We hypothesized that Asian countries with low dairy consumption have an alternative source of BCFA and report the characterization of natto and selected fermented foods for BCFA content. Natto BCFA averaged 0.6 (range 0.21-1.43) mg BCFA per g natto (wet weight) and was highly variable. Natto major BCFA are C14-17 iso-and anteiso-BCFA similar to fluid milk. BCFA concentrations were 1.00 +/- 0.64%, 1.63 +/- 0.72% and 0.65 +/- 0.07%, of total fatty acids in natto, shrimp paste and fish sauce, respectively. In contrast, saturates, monounsaturates, and major polyunsaturates were more constant (coefficient of variation = 21%, 26% and 4% compared to 64% for natto BCFA). Detection of fatty acid ethyl esters were confirmed in miso and found in homemade kimchi. Habitual natto and/or fermented seafood consumption could support BCFA intakes similar to dairy consumption.

AB An efficient system for biotransformation of sucrose to fructooligosaccharides (FOS) was obtained using Aspergillus tamarii NKRC 1229 mycelial fructosyltransferase (m-FTase). Zymographic analysis confirmed mycelial localization of the FTase (36 U/g) and lyophilized fungal pellets were used for bioconversion. m-FTase had molecular weight similar to 75 kDa with optimum activity at pH 7.0 and 20 degrees C. FOS production after parametric optimization (sucrose-50% w/v, m-FTase dose - 4.5% w/v, inoculum age - 48 h and incubation time-24 h) reached 325 g/L (55% yield) with 14% residual sucrose, 25% glucose and 6% fructose. FTase activity was enhanced after pre-treatment with organic solvents and SDS. FOS was purified in a single step using gel filtration matrix, Bio-Gel P2. FOS was characterized using Diffusion ordered spectroscopy-Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (H-1 DOSY-NMR) and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). Continuous generation of FOS was achieved using recyclable mycelia upto 10 consecutive cycles.

AB We investigate the formation mechanism of supramolecular complexes of four antioxidant oligopeptides (YW, WY, WYS, and WYSL) with beta-cyclodextrin (beta-CD), hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin (HP-beta-CD) and 6-O-alpha-maltosyl-beta- cyclodextrin (M-beta-CD) by combined computational and experimental methods. The formation of complexes is determined by UV, IR and DSC, and the rank-ordered acquired stability of the complexes is as follows: WYSL/HP-beta- CD > WYS/HP-beta-CD > WY/HP-beta-CD > YW/M-beta-CD > YW/HP-beta-CD > YW/beta-CD. The H-1 NMR analysis and molecular docking results reveal that the aromatic rings of these oligopeptides are embedded into the cavities of the studied beta-CD and its derivatives, indicating that hydrophobic interaction is a major driving force for the formation of the complexes. We also demonstrate that H-bonds play a key role in maintaining the supramolecular complexes. In addition, the results of the antioxidant assay indicate that the radical scavenging capacity of the oligopeptides is enhanced by the CD-based inclusion.

AB The objective was to utilize a moisture distribution model to summarize the influence of water content on the structural properties of lotus seed resistant starch. The result showed that water content affected the composition of resistant starch. The compact structure was observed on the surface of resistant starch prepared with 50% water content; other samples displayed a flake structure. Compared with samples prepared with insufficient (50% and 60%) or excess water (95% and 90%), resistant starches prepared with 70% and 80% water content were composed of higher-molecular-weight chains and consisted of more double helix and crystal. Two corresponding relationships between the structural properties of resistant starch and the water distribution in them were found. Bound water was related to the hydrated starch chains, while channel water in B-type crystal represented the micro-crystalline structure. Therefore, moisture distribution model can be feasibly used to depict the structural properties of resistant starch.

AB Quantitative analyses of mono-p-coumaroylquinic acids (pCoQAs) and total chlorogenic acids (CGAs) in green coffee commercial lots of C. arabica, C. canephora and C. liberica from different geographical origins and eight wild Coffea species were carried out. Among the commercial lots, pCoQAs average content of C. arabica (0.67 mg/g) is higher than that of C. canephora (0.40 mg/g) being C. liberica intermediate (0.58 mg/g). As far as the analyzed wild Coffea species is concerned, C. pseudozanguebariae is characterized by the lower pCoQAs content (0.12 mg/g) whereas C. sessiliflora is by far the richest source of pCoQAs (2.18 mg/g). Effect of the roasting process on the mono-p-coumaroylquinic acids profile was evaluated for the economically exploited species C. arabica and C. canephora. For the first time distribution of mono-p-coumaroylquinic acid isomers in wild coffee species by fast and accurate UHPLC-DAD analyses using authentic standards previously synthetized, is reported.

AB Physicochemical and emulsification properties of dialdehyde starch nanocrystals (DASNCs) and dialdehyde starch nanoparticles (DASNPs) were measured in this study. The starch nanocrystals (SNCs), which are prepared by sulfuric acid hydrolysis, were oxidized by sodium periodate to obtain the DASNCs. The DASNPs were prepared by gelatinization and alcohol precipitation of dialdehyde starch. After oxidization by sodium periodate, the SNCs and SNPs became smaller and more suitable for dispersion. X-ray diffraction results showed that the crystal pattern of the SNCs was preserved after oxidation. However, only a single broad peak at the Bragg angle of the DASNPs was observed. The SNCs and DASNCs can form Pickering emulsions, but the emulsions stabilized by the SNPs and DASNPs could be easily broken. The preparation methods for the two kinds of dialdehyde starch nanoparticles are different, so their structures, properties and applications are different.

AB Prediction of the geographic origin of white asparagus was realized using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) and machine learning techniques. The elemental profile of 319 asparagus samples originating from Germany, Poland, the Netherlands, Greece, Spain, China and Peru was determined. Using a support vector machine (SVM) combined with nested cross-validation, a prediction accuracy of 91.2% was achieved when classifying the country of origin. Accuracy can be increased up to 98% on subsets of samples with high SVM prediction scores. Most relevant elements for provenance discrimination were lithium, cobalt, rubidium, strontium, uranium and the rare earth elements. In addition, the multi-elemental method provided specific fingerprints of asparagus cultivation sites as German samples could be assigned correctly with an accuracy of 82.6%. Asparagus variety and harvest year had no significant influence on provenance distinction, which further underlines the robustness of this study.

AB A nontoxic chromatographic matrix, with low cost and high adsorption capacity, is always a major goal for therapeutic protein purification. In this study, the frustules from two cultured diatoms, Nitzschia bilobata (AQ1) and Psammodictyon panduriforme (NP), were investigated as cation exchange materials for lysozyme purification from chicken egg white. The surface area and cation exchange capacity of frustules were about 400m(2)/g and 140 mu mol/mL for AQ1, 390m(2)/g and 130 mu mol/mL for NP. The optimal pH was 9 for adsorption. Through batch purification, the lysozyme recovery was 86% with a purity of 95% by AQ1 frustules, which was higher than that by NP frustules (82% with a purity of 90%). In the flow-through system, the purity using AQ1 frustules notably increased to 99%, higher than the result of 91% using NP frustules. Diatom frustules from AQ1 are more effective and could be an alternative chromatographic matrix for lysozyme purification.

AB Flavor is critical to the commercial acceptance of the highly valued Chinese mitten crab (Eriocheir sinensis). This study investigated the important odorants (IOs) in male E. sinensis hepatopancreas formed from phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) in model systems. A total of fifteen IOs were detected by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry-olfactometry (GC-MS-O). Among the IOs that were also detected as oxidation products of PE extract were hexanal, heptanal, nonanal, 2-pentylfuran and 2-octanone, and the optimized oxidation conditions of PE extract were 175 degrees C for 60 min. For further analysis, nine PE species were considered important precursors of IOs in E. sinensis. Odorants derived from PE (16:0/18:2), PE (18:0/18:2), PE (18:0/20:4), PE (16:0/22:6), and PE (18:0p/22:6) specie standards were detected, and their oxidative stabilities are discussed. These findings are important for understanding the comprehensive formation mechanism of IOs in E. sinensis, which may provide theoretical guidance for improving the overall flavor of aquatic products.

AB A switchable solvent based liquid phase microextraction (SS-LPME) has been proposed for the determination of cobalt in egg yolk and Vitamin B12 at trace levels. N, N-Dimethylbenzylamide (DMBA) was used as a switchable solvent and converted to protonated DMBA form by the addition of dry ice. Cobalt was complexed with 1,5-diphenylcarbazone (DPC) and extracted into the DMBA phase. After the extraction, HNO3 was added to increase nebulization efficiency of the DMBA phase. Slotted quartz tube (SQT) was combined with FAAS to enhance the detection power of the system when compared to the conventional FAAS. Under the optimum conditions, limit of detection values were recorded as 75 mu g L-1 for FAAS, 33 mu g L-1 for SQT-FAAS, 7.6 mu g L-1 for SS-LPME-FAAS, and 2.3 mu g L-1 for SS-LPME-SQT-FAAS. The developed method was applied for the determination of cobalt in egg yolk and Vitamin B12 and the recovery results were found in the range of 105-114% with 0.30-7.6 standard deviation values (n = 3).

AB The iTRAQ-based quantitative proteomic strategy was used to reveal the effects of magnetic nanoparticles plus microwave thawing (MNPMT) on the largemouth bass fillets quality. A total number of 47 proteins were identified as differentially abundant proteins (DAPs) in fillets treated by microwave thawing (MT), while 13 DAPs were in MNPMT. Bioinformatics analysis of Gene ontology (GO) enrichment, Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment, Protein-protein interaction (PPI) and subcellular localization prediction of DAPs showed that many DAPs were involved in protein structure, metabolic enzymes, protein turnover and so on. The correlation analyses indicated that 14 DAPs were significantly related with the fillet quality traits. Besides, several discovered proteins might be potential protein markers for pH, color, cooking loss and centrifuge loss of thawed largemouth bass fillet quality. These results provided a further understanding of quality stability of largemouth bass fillet treated by MNPMT from the perspective of proteomics.

AB Graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) doped carboxylated MWCNTs nanocomposite was synthesized using a simple method. The composite films containing 45 wt%, 50 wt%, 56 wt%, 67 wt% fraction of the carboxylated MWCNTs doped into g-C3N4 were fabricated and characterized. An electrochemical non-enzymatic sensor for determination of 5'-guanosine monophosphate (GMP) based on the nanocomposite was developed. The results indicate that the g-C3N4-carboxylated MWCNTs nanocomposite has highly electrocatalytic activity, good conductivity and biocompatibility, which plays an essential role in the determination of GMP. Under the optimum conditions, the linear fitting equation was I (mu A)=-0.0022c (mu g.mL(-1))+ 0.3560 (R-2= 0.9982). The linear range was from 0.5 to 100 mu g.mL(-1) and the detection limit (LOD, S/N= 3) was 0.109 mu g.mL(-1). This non-enzymatic sensor can offer a better alternative to other methods for the analysis of GMP because of cheap cost, low detection limit and good anti-jamming capability in meat quality evaluation.

AB The insoluble dietary fiber from ginseng residue (ginseng-IDF) was extracted using the AOAC (Association of Official Analytical Chemists) method with content of 68.61%. Ginseng-IDF had a polysaccharide content of 18.87%, uronic acid content of 7.85%, protein content of 6.52%, and had ideal water-holding capacity (17.66 g/g), swelling ability (15.05 mL/g), and oil-holding capacity (1.78 g/g). Scanning electron microscope, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and X-ray diffraction analyses suggested that ginseng-IDF had the typical structures of hydrolysis fiber, polysaccharide functional groups, and crystal structure of cellulose. Different fiber components give ginseng-IDF a specified range of pyrolysis temperature, and it is suitable for application in food processing lower than 300 degrees C. In addition, ginseng-IDF exhibited notable glucose and sodium cholate adsorption, significantly improved nitrite adsorption at pH 2.0 and cholesterol adsorption at pH 7.0. The above results show that ginseng-IDF could be used as an ideal functional ingredient in food processing.

AB The entrapment of peptides can effectively improve their bioavailability and commercial application. This research sought to investigate the mechanism of entrapment of egg white derived peptides (EWDP) loaded in chitosan-tripolyphosphate (CS-TPP) nanoparticles (NPs). It was shown that CS molecular weight (MW), pH, CS-TPP mass ratio and CS concentration can all affect the size, polydispersity index and zeta potential of CS-TPP NPs. Moreover, these factors, as well as different MW and CS mass ratio of peptides also had an influence on entrapment efficiency (EE). Furthermore, peptides influenced the zeta potential after they were loaded in the CS-TPP NPs. This suggested that the peptide charged groups were in different locations relative to the CS-TPP NPs surfaces. FTIR analysis indicated that the peptides interacted with CS-TPP NPs through strong hydrogen bonds and electrostatic interactions. These findings are important for designing delivery systems used for commercial production of entrapped peptides with enhanced attributes.

ID CHROMATOGRAPHY
AB Sulfites are food additives found in a large variety of food products to help reduce oxidation and browning. A small subset of the population has "allergic-like" symptoms upon consumption of sulfite containing foods. There are several sulfite detection methods available in the literature that vary in analysis time and required instrumentation. There are also rapid screening tests available that have not been tested extensively for accuracy and precision. In this study, four different methods (an LC-MS/MS method, a spectrophotometric method, a test strip method and a spot test method) were used to determine the sulfite concentration of 10 different commercially sulfited products. Of these methods, the LC-MS/MS and the spectrophotometric method had the most comparable results. The test strips were only accurate at concentrations greater than 50 mg/kg (ppm) SO2. The spot test method was found to be inaccurate with both standard solutions and samples.

AB This study investigated the effects of Bacillus subtilis grown in high-cell-density culture (HC) on mold growth suppression and postharvest quality improvement in Kyoho grapes. The HC supernatant (HS) of B. subtilis was more potent than the conventional B. subtilis culture supernatant (CS) in suppressing fungal growth on grapes. Specifically, HS was more effective than CS in maintaining the cosmetic qualities (colour, firmness and abscission rate) and physiological indices (respiration, weight loss, pectinases, antioxidant enzymes and titratable acidity). Chemical analyses showed that HC enhanced the secretion of lipopeptides in B. subtilis culture, and high-pressure liquid chromatography further demonstrated that iturin A and surfactin were increased by 1.78- and 1.23-fold in HS compared with CS, respectively. However, LC-MS/MS analysis revealed that HC only upregulated iturins and surfactins, but not fengycins. Therefore, HC may provide an effective method to enrich antifungal lipopeptides from B. subtilis for preservation of fruits and vegetables.

AB Since the potato is a new staple food in China, the production of selenium (Se)-enriched potato may be an effective approach for Se supplementation in Se-deficient populations. Herein, we biofortified potato via the foliar application of sodium selenate and sodium selenite at three growth stages and investigated the resulting Se contents and speciation. Results showed that selenate was more efficient than selenite in improving total Se, and the highest tuber Se concentration was obtained at the tuber bulking stage. However, the accumulation of inorganic Se was higher in tubers treated with selenate (31.9% of total Se) compared with the selenite treatment (1.5%). The major Se species in tubers treated with both selenite and selenate was selenomethionine, which accounted for similar to 80.0% and similar to 50.0% of total Se, respectively. The findings suggest that the foliar application of selenite during the tuber bulking stage is appropriate for the production of Se-rich potatoes.

AB Cotyledon cells in kidney beans naturally encapsulate starch and proteins limiting the access of digestive enzymes to their substrates. In this study, we investigated the effect of cell wall on bean protein digestibility and its relationship with starch digestion. Results showed that proteins contained in the cytoplasmic matrix influence the rate at which starch is digested in-vitro. Confocal laser scanning microscopy revealed that storage proteins in the cytoplasm act as a second encapsulation system preventing starch digestion. This microstructural organization only affected starch since no changes in protein digestion rate or extent were observed due to the presence of starch granules. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy revealed that cellular entrapment limited protein denaturation induced by thermal treatments. High concentrations of a fraction resistant to digestion were found in proteins that were heated when entrapped within intact cotyledon cells, compared to those thermally treated as bean flour.

ID QUALITY
AB The nitrogen fraction of 39 food waste streams was characterized by Kjeldahl analysis, amino acid analysis, protein analysis and racemization degree, for assessing their potential for further valorization. For every waste streams the specific nitrogen-to-protein conversion factor was calculated, allowing to assess the accurate protein content. The results indicated which streams are most rich in relevant proteins (all wastes of dairy origin, beer yeast, malted barley germs, brewing cake, rapeseed press cake, sea buckthorn spent pulp, leek leaves, parsley waste, pumpkin kernel cake, and mushroom waste), which ones have valuable proteins, but in too little amount, and also which ones are rich in proteins, but of low nutritional value. Specific data also indicated, for every waste stream, its possible use for supplementing specific amino acids. To date, this represents the most complete characterization with homogeneous methodologies of the nitrogen fraction in food waste streams ever reported in the literature and outlines in unprecedented molecular details the potentialities and the limitations of many waste streams to be used as source of proteins.

AB Sensory and nutritional properties of mango pulp thawed by different ultrasound intensities and temperatures were studied. Compared to water immersion thawing, a thawing time reduction of 16-64% (p < 0.05) and more phenolic acids contents (gallic, hydroxybenzoic, and caffeic acid) were observed after ultrasonic thawing. The sensory evaluation revealed texture and aroma deterioration at higher ultrasonic intensities (4 degrees C: 0.074 W/mL; 25 degrees C: 0.123 W/mL) due to increase in viscosity and some volatile compounds in the mango pulp. Ultrasonic thawing treatment at 25 degrees C reduced thawing time by 51-73% compared to that at 4 degrees C. Mango pulp processed at 25 degrees C exhibited better sensory quality and retained 26.5-58.5% more total phenol and 8.7-11.0% more total carotenoid contents. In short, higher ultrasonic intensities (0.074-0.123 W/mL) at a temperature of 25 degrees C contributed to better thawing efficiency and nutritional quality. The results demonstrated that ultrasound processing at optimized conditions could serve as a potential alternative to conventional thawing processing of mango pulp.

AB This study reports the blending at different levels (25, 30, 35, 40 and 45%) of Perilla seed oil (PO) with extra virgin olive oil (EVOO). Pure oils and blends were evaluated in terms of free acidity, peroxide value, fatty acid composition, sterols, tocopherols and biophenols content, oxidation stability, sensory acceptability and food pairing. Blends with high content of omega - 3 and omega - 6 fatty acids, biophenols, tocopherols, sterols and satisfying oxidation stability were obtained, representing products with improved nutritional properties. All blends resulted acceptable by consumers. Two groups of consumers with opposite preferences for samples with low (25-35%) and high (40-45%) levels of PO were identified. Blends containing 40-45% of PO were mainly paired to strong-flavour and cooked foods, while blends with less PO were preferably matched with raw meat and vegetables. Consequently, PO and EVOO blends showed promising potential as innovative vegetable oils with improved nutritional properties and versatile gastronomic use.

AB Quinoa is a pseudo-cereal with high phytochemical contents with proven biological and nutritional significance. In recent decades several breeding programmes have introduced new and traditional quinoa varieties to North America and other non-traditional quinoa regions, raising questions regarding variability in their secondary metabolite profiles. In this work, we have fingerprinted 28 quinoa varieties cultivated in Washington State, focussing on the poorly investigated oil fraction. We found variability in both phenolics and carotenoid contents, which is reflected in different antioxidant capacities, as measured by FRAP and DPPH. Fatty acid profiles show significant differences in palmitic acid and long-chain fatty acids. Finally, conspicuous amounts of phytosterols and squalene were found. Through factor analysis, we classified the quinoa varieties into two groups: a first comprising varieties with higher phytochemical and PUFA contents and a second group, with higher linolenic and long-chain fatty acid contents. Both groups may be suitable for potential food applications.

AB This study investigated the effectiveness of cysteine in conservation of bioactive compounds and the antioxidant capacity of minimally processed red beet. After red beet minimal processing increasing cysteine concentrations were applied, corresponding to control, 2 mM, 4 mM, 8mM and 16 mM. Assay was performed over 15 d to evaluate the polyphenols, betalains, antioxidant capacity and enzymatic activity of polyphenol oxidase (PPO) and phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL). Cysteine enhanced the gallic acid, caffeic acid, chlorogenic acid, kaempferol and betalain contents until 6 d of storage. Subsequently, dosages of cysteine above 4mM maintained gallic acid, kaempferol and betalains contents. Cysteine appears to influence the phenylpropanoid pathway, favoring the accumulation of polyphenols and betalains. In red beet, cysteine did not inhibit PPO activity but enhanced PAL activity. Betalains contribute more than phenolics to the antioxidant capacity, and their relationship with cysteine has not been thoroughly elucidated to date.

AB The effects of honeys from different floral origins on alcohol metabolism were compared, and the correlation between their chemical compositions and antialcholic effects was analyzed. The results demonstrated that the five types of investigated honeys from different floral origins had different effects on alcohol metabolism, and the blood alcohol removal rate by these honeys ranged from 18.01% to 49.17%. Ziziphus jujuba honey exhibited the best blood alcohol removal effect, and meanwhile significantly enhanced the activity of alcohol-metabolizing enzymes including alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) and aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH). Chemical composition analysis also showed that honeys from different floral origins were considerably different in the contents of sugars, minerals, ascorbic acid and phenolics. Ziziphus jujuba honey had the highest fructose/glucose ratio, ascorbic acid and phenolics contents, and higher contents of minerals, especially K, Ca, Mg, Fe, Cu, Zn and Mn. This chemical composition might contribute to its better anti-alcoholic effect.

AB This study investigated the effect of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) fermentation on the chemical profile of autoclaved broccoli puree, using 7 broccoli-derived LAB isolates (named F1-F5, BF1 and BF2). The total concentrations of glucosinolates (glucoiberin, progoitrin and glucoraphanin) and 10 major phenolics significantly increased from trace level and 289 mu g total phenolics/g dry weight (DW) respectively in autoclaved broccoli to 55 to similar to 359 mu g/g DW and 903 to similar to 3105 mu g/g DW respectively in LAB fermented broccoli puree. Differential impacts of LAB isolates on the chemical composition of autoclaved broccoli were observed, with the major differences being the significant increase in phloretic acid after fermentation by F1-F5 and an elevated glucoraphanin level in ferments by F1 and BF2. LAB fermentation is a promising way to increase the content of glucosinolates and polyphenolic compounds in broccoli, making the ferments attractive for use as functional ingredients or as a whole functional food.

AB Benzo[a] pyrene (BaP), a carcinogenic polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon, is ubiquitous in nature, including smoked and grilled meats. BaP degradation has attracted attention due to its recalcitrant chemical nature. In this study, low-pressure cold plasma (LPCP) was used to degrade BaP on glass slides and in food materials. LPCP discharges were generated using different working gases (air, N-2, O-2), at chamber pressures (0.1-5.0 Torr), and with plasma powers (72-168 W). Optimal BaP degradation was observed upon treatment using LPCP generated with air as working gas (LPAP) at 1.0 Torr pressure and at 168W power. Under this condition, initial BaP concentration on slides was reduced maximally by 82.7% in 30 min. The degradation kinetics of BaP were well fitted by a Weibull tail model compared with others. In food materials (roasted sesame and perilla seeds), the average levels of BaP degradation ranged between 40 and 46% following LPAP treatment for 30 min.

AB Quercetin, a plant-extracted flavonol, is a potent inhibitor of carbohydrate digestive enzymes. This study aimed to examine: (1) the extent to which quercetin altered the starch digestion and the glycemic potential of the fortified western baked bread as well as oriental steamed bread, (2) the matrix effects of bread on the potential bioaccessibility and bioavailability of quercetin. The starch digestion of bread was quantitatively evaluated by determination of starch digestion rate (k) via a developed mathematical model. Results showed a significant reduction of k for the 1.5, 3, and 6% quercetin-fortified baked and steamed bread compared to the controls by up to 18.3%. The predicted GIs of the baked bread samples with quercetin were significantly reduced in comparison to control bread. Moreover, the potential bioaccessibility of quercetin incorporated in bread products was significantly higher than that of quercetin supplement probably as a result of the protective effects from food matrix.

AB A comprehensive analysis of graded binary and ternary blends of palm kernel oil (PKO), palm kernel stearin (PKS) and palm stearin (POs) was conducted, including solid fat content, iso-solid diagram, thermal properties, polymorphism and microstructure. Both PKO/POs and PKS/POs blends showed eutectic behavior. While PKO/PKS blends displayed good compatibility and only slightly monotectic effect at high temperature (above 30 degrees C). POs addition elevated binary phase transition temperature and accelerated the beta crystal formation. PKO/POs and PKS/POs binaries showed beta' polymorphism, beta and beta' polymorphism, and beta polymorphism with different POs additions, while all of PKO/PKS blends showed beta' polymorphism. Ternary blends (PKO/PKS/POs) showed eutectic effects, especially at high temperature (25 and 30 degrees C). POs addition made ternary blends undergo a polymorphism transformation from beta' to beta. Our findings open up the possibility of non-hydrogenated fat products as well as develop specific food formulations.

AB Brazil is a major producer of rice, but there is not enough information about As and Cd in rice grown under different conditions in this country. Here, As and Cd were determined by ICP-MS and species of As by HPLC-ICP-MS in Brazilian husked rice, covering diverse cultivars and regions, as well as upland and flooded production systems. Significant differences were observed for contents of both elements according to the origin of rice. All samples were below the maximum limit for Cd (400 mu g/kg) set by national legislation, while nine samples presented total As above the legislation limit (300 mu g/kg). From 24 samples analyzed for As species, 42% showed iAs above the European limit for production of food to infants (100 mu g/kg). The total As content in samples from Mato Grosso state presented a maximum value of 6 mu g/kg, which combined with low Cd content make interesting further studies.

AB Cassava, rice, and banana flours were used individually to replace wheat flour in cereal-legume-based composite flours. The proximate composition, mineral content, antinutritional effect, mineral molar ratios, and aflatoxin level were investigated. Replacing wheat flour with rice flour significantly (P < 0.05) improved protein, fat, potassium, and phosphorus content in samples. The molar ratios of phytate or oxalate to minerals (calcium and zinc) in all composite flours were lower than the reported critical values, except phytate to iron. However, all samples, except full replacement by rice flour, might not provide adequate zinc bioavailability when the effect of calcium and phytate on zinc absorption was collectively considered. Although all composite flours were contaminated with aflatoxins, only the control composed of wheat flour did not meet the EU regulatory threshold (4.0 mu g/kg) for total aflatoxins. The findings showed that nutritional properties and aflatoxin content of composite flours can be improved by replacement with local crops.

AB Volatile organic compounds, quality and sensory attributes of sweet cherry cv "Ferrovia", cold packaged in Air or in different modified atmospheres (Low-O-2= 1% O-2/0.03% CO2; High-CO2 = 16% O-2/20% CO2; Mix = 1% O-2/20% CO2), were monitored until 21 days of conservation. Results showed that sweet cherry cv "Ferrovia" is sensitive to CO2 accumulation (over 20%) in low oxygen (about 1%) modified atmosphere, as showed by the increase in respiration rate, biosynthesis of fermentative volatile metabolites, and sensory perception of off-odours. However, High-CO2 treatment seemed to preserve quality and sensory traits, presumably due to the high initial concentration of O-2 (16%) that could limit the synthesis of ethyl esters and gamma-butyrolactone, keeping the accumulation of off-flavours below their sensory perception threshold. Finally, PLSR analysis allowed to select 1-pentanol as putative marker of sensory alteration and hexanal and 2-hexenal as possible predictors of freshness for "Ferrovia" sweet cherries.

AB Walnut (Juglans regia L.) is an abundant source of polyphenols. Although phenolic species in the walnut kernel have been studied comprehensively, their compositional profile in the internal fruit septum, a traditional nutraceutical material in China, has been rarely explored. In the current study, the methanolic extract of the walnut septum was analysed by Ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled with Orbitrap mass spectrometry. Totally seventy-five phenolics belonging to flavonoids, tannins and phenolic acids were identified based on mass spectra, references and literatures. Among them, quercetin-3-O-galactoside, quercetin-rhamnose-pentoside, quercetin-3-O-glucoside, quercetin-rhamnose-hexoside, kaempferol-rhamnoside, and two isomers of quercetinrhamnoside were reported for the first time in walnut. The total polyphenol content was found to be 122.78 +/- 2.55 mg GAE/g dry weight in septum. This study is the first to comprehensively investigate and identify phenolic compounds in the fruit septum of walnut and indicates that the septum to be a rich resource of polyphenols.

AB The effects of co-digestion of a carotenoid-rich vegetable such as carrot, cherry tomato or baby spinach with an anthocyanin-rich vegetable such as red cabbage with and without salad dressing on the intestinal cellular bioaccessibility (cBAC) of carotenoids and the resultant cellular antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities were investigated. The % cBAC of lutein from the tested vegetables was 0.23-1.42%, lycopene 0.07-0.39%, acarotene 0.01-0.12% and beta-carotene 0.03-0.61% respectively. The % cBAC of each of these carotenoids from the co-digested vegetables was significantly higher (p < 0.05) than from carrot, cherry tomato or baby spinach digested alone. % cBAC of total carotenoids was significantly increased by 46-191% (p < 0.05) as a result of the co-digestion. The vegetable co-digestion did not result in any impairment on the resultant cellular anti-oxidation and anti-inflammation (NO, IL-8 secretion). Among the tested vegetables, baby spinach co-digested with red cabbage showed synergistic bioactivities in all tested assays.

AB Chemical composition and bioactivity of eight edible Vitis vinifera L. leaf varieties originating from Fruska Gora, Serbia, including two autochthonous varieties, were evaluated. The LC-MS/MS analysis confirmed the presence of 28 natural products in leaf samples, among which most abundant were glycosylated flavonoids, ellagic and chlorogenic acids. The highest amounts of most of the tested compounds were detected in leaves of autochthonous variety Sila. Bioactivity was assessed by a set of in vitro antioxidant, neuroprotective and cytotoxic assays. Leaves of all examined varieties exhibited average bioactivity, with leaves of autochthonous variety Zupljanka standing out as the most promising sample. To conclude, investigated grapevine leaves proved to be a rich source of nutraceuticals, primarily antioxidants, and their further employment as medicinal food in human diet and beneficial raw material for food, pharmaceutical and cosmetic industries should be supported.

The novel recombinant enzyme (Csn21c) was purified by Ni-NTA Superflow Column and showed a molecular mass of 29.6 kDa by SDS-PAGE. The enzyme Csn21c showed the optimal activity in 50 mmol/L Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, and 50 degrees C and it was strongly activated (2-fold) by Mn2+. It belonged to glycoside hydrolase 46 family according to NCBI database (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) and displayed an exo-type cleavage pattern, hydrolyzing chitosan mainly into D-glucosamine (GlcN) and chitobiose ((GlcN)(2)) as confirmed by TLC and MS analysis. This study demonstrated that Csn21c can be an effective tool to produce abundant glucosamine and chitooligosaccharides (COS) from chitosan.

AB Optical analytical images were captured by a digital camera, and lipid peroxidation was monitored using colorimetric determination. The Image-J method was shown to have comparable accuracy to the conventional titration (American Oil Chemists' Society) and UV-Vis spectroscopic methods. Over the PV range 3-14 meq.O2/ kg, a good correlation (R-2= 0.9836) was found between the proposed method and UV-Vis method with an SD of +/- 0.0339 meq. O-2/kg. The range and accuracy of detection were determined from the changes in the Image-J intensity values. At equivalent PV, the limit of detection was 0.175 meq.O-2/kg and the limit of quantitation was 0.35 meq. O-2/kg. The proposed Image-J application can be used to develop fast and portable devices for monitoring peroxide values. These have potential applications in quality control for small-scale farmers and small and medium enterprises.

AB A high-precision isotope dilution GC-MS method was employed for the determination of nitrate in processed vegetables. The samples were extracted in water, derivatized with triethyloxonium tetrafluoroborate and analyzed by headspace GC-MS (15 samples/h). The method was applied to estimate the effect of drying on the content of nitrate in vegetables. The absolute amount of nitrate in a spinach sample before and after drying did not change even when the material was baked at 105 degrees C. Elevated levels of nitrate were found in commercial vegetable powders where the nitrate mass fraction exceed the percent level: 1.2-2.3% NO3- was found in spinach powders, 1.3-1.6% in kale powders, and 1.4% in a beetroot powder. The likely reduction of the antioxidant properties seen in vegetable powders along with their high nitrate content suggest the need to study the risk of endogenous N-nitrosation associated with these products.

ID VACCINE
AB In January 2015, a significant cold chain breach on a postnatal ward in a tertiary hospital in Sydney, Australia was noted to have been occurring since August 2013. Surveillance, amongst the 1178 mothers and 1178 babies affected, for vaccine-preventable diseases (VPDs) and adverse events following immunisation (AEFIs) using linkage with a notifiable diseases database was subsequently undertaken; no directly related instances of VPDs or AEFIs were detected. We evaluate this novel systematic surveillance method which has not been previously reported to determine whether it is effective in determining the impact of cold chain breaches on an individual and population level. The recommendation for revaccination of the affected mothers and subsequent surveillance was resource-intensive and future studies related to such incidents should focus on detailing the resources used to allow the costs versus benefits of such systematic surveillance to be determined.

AB Widespread use of Pneumococcal Conjugate Vaccines (PCV) has reduced vaccine-type nasopharyngeal colonisation and invasive pneumococcal disease. In a double-blind, randomised controlled trial using the Experimental Human Pneumococcal Challenge (EHPC) model, PCV-13 (Prevenar-13) conferred 78% protection against colonisation acquisition and reduced bacterial intensity (AUC) as measured by classical culture. We used a multiplex qPCR assay targeting lytA and pneumococcal serotype 6A/B cpsA genes to reassess the colonisation status of the same volunteers. Increase in detection of low-density colonisation resulted in reduced PCV efficacy against colonisation acquisition (29%), compared to classical culture (83%). For experimentally colonised volunteers, PCV had a pronounced effect on decreasing colonisation density. These results obtained in adults suggest that the success of PCV vaccination could primarily be mediated by the control of colonisation density. Studies assessing the impact of pneumococcal vaccines should allow for density measurements in their design. (C) 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

ID EFFICACY
AB Cervical cancer is a global public health problem and human papillomavirus (HPV) 16 accounts for approximately 50% of cases worldwide. Although there are several types of HPV therapeutic vaccines in clinical research, there are currently not approved for use in humans. We developed the fusion protein LALF(32)(-51)-E7 (hereafter denominated CIGB550-E7) defined by a cell-penetrating peptide linked to an E7 mutein for the treatment of HPV16-associated tumors. We have demonstrated previously the benefit on antitumor response induced by the immunization with CIGB550-E7 admixed with very small size proteoliposomes (VSSP) adjuvant compared with the adjuvant-free immunization. In this study, we obtained a similar antitumor response in mice immunized with CIGB550-E7 admixed with the new adjuvant sVSSP that does not contain any animal-derived product. Also, the immunization with the above mentioned vaccine preparation induced a cell-mediated immune response. Our results are encouraging for the future clinical trials with the vaccine candidate C1GB550-E7+sVSSP. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Leptospirosis is a neglected infectious disease of global importance. Vaccination is the most viable strategy for the control of leptospirosis, but in spite of efforts for the development of an effective vaccine against the disease, few advances have been made, and to date, bacterin is the only option for prevention of leptospirosis. Bacterins are formulations based on inactivated leptospires that present a series of drawbacks, such as serovar-dependence and short-term immunity. Therefore, bacterins are not widely used in humans, and only Cuba, France and China have these vaccines licensed for at-risk populations. The development of recombinant DNA technology emerges as an alternative to solve the problem. Recombinant protein-based vaccines or DNA vaccines seem to be an attractive strategy, but the use of adjuvants is critical for achievement of a protective immune response. Adjuvants are capable of enhancing and/or modulating immune responses by exposing antigens to antigen-presenting cells. In the last years, several components have been tested as adjuvants, such as aluminum salts, oil based-emulsion adjuvants, bacteria-derived components and liposomes. This review highlights the use of adjuvants in the multiple vaccine approaches that have been used for leptospirosis and their most important immunological aspects. Immune response data generated by these strategies can contribute to the understanding of the immune mechanisms involved in protection against leptospirosis, and consequently, the development of effective vaccines against this disease. This is the first review on leptospiral vaccines focusing on adjuvant aspects. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB The drivers of vaccine development are many and varied. They include, for example, recognition of the burden of a vaccine-targeted disease, prioritisation of the multiple problems associated with a disease, consideration of the differing socio-economic situations under which vaccines are used, the influence of advocacy groups, and assessment of the feasibility of large-scale vaccine manufacture and distribution. In the field of human health, data-driven development of vaccines is becoming increasingly common through the availability of reliable information on the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) and stringent evaluations of vaccination programmes utilising empirical data on costing and effectiveness, and standardised cost-effectiveness thresholds. The data generated from such analyses allow policymakers, implementing partners, industries and researchers to make decisions based on the best, and most contextually relevant, available evidence. In this paper, we wish to explore the current use of economic and social data for the development of veterinary vaccines. Through comparison with the development of human vaccines, we will look for opportunities in animal health sciences to better integrate socioeconomic data and analyses into the process of veterinary vaccine selection, development, and field implementation. We believe that more robust animal health impact assessments could add value to veterinary vaccine development by improving resource allocation and animal disease management. (C) 2018 The Authors.

AB Brucellosis is a worldwide zoonosis affecting animal and human health. Till now, there is no effective vaccine licensed for brucellosis in humans. Although M5, H38 and 45/20 vaccines were used to prevent animal brucellosis in the early stages, the currently used animal vaccines are S19, Rev.1, S2, RB51 and SR82. However, these vaccines still have several drawbacks such as residual virulence and interfering conventional serological tests. With the development of DNA recombination technologies and the completion of the sequence of Brucella genome, much research focuses on the search for potential safer and more effective vaccines. Preliminary studies have demonstrated that new vaccines, including genetically engineered attenuated vaccines, subunit vaccines and other potential vaccines, have higher levels of protection, but there are still some problems. In this paper, we briefly review the main vaccines that have been used in controlling the brucellosis for decades and the progress in the development of new brucellosis vaccines.

AB Since the discovery of Toxoplasma gondii in 1908, it is estimated that one-third of the global population has been exposed to this ubiquitous intracellular protozoan. The complex life cycle of T. gondii has enabled itself to overcome stress and transmit easily within a broad host range thus achieving a high seroprevalence worldwide. To date, toxoplasmosis remains one of the most prevalent HIV-associated opportunistic central nervous system infections. This review presents a comprehensive overview of different vaccination approaches ranging from traditional inactivated whole-T. gondii vaccines to the popular DNA vaccines. Extensive discussions are made to highlight the challenges in constructing these vaccines, selecting adjuvants as well as delivery methods, immunisation approaches and developing study models. Herein we also deliberate over the latest and promising enhancement strategies that can address the limitations in developing an effective T. gondii prophylactic vaccine. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Objectives: In 2012, British Columbia (BC) implemented a province-wide vaccinate-or-mask influenza prevention policy for healthcare workers (HCWs) with the aim of improving HCW coverage, and reducing illness in patients and staff. We assess post-policy impacts of HCW vaccination status on their absenteeism.
   Methods: We matched individual HCW payroll data from December 1, 2012 to March 31, 2017 with annually self-reported vaccination status for BC health authority employees to assess sick rates (sick time as a proportion of sick time and productive time). We modelled adjusted odds ratios (OR) of taking any sick time, relative rates (RR) of sick time taken, and predicted mean sick rates by vaccination status in influenza (December 1-March 31) and non-influenza seasons (April 1 to November 30). We used two methods to assess changes in influenza season sick rates for HCWs who had a change in their vaccination status over the five years.
   Results: HCWs who reported 'early' vaccination (before December 1 when the policy is in effect) were less likely to take sick time (OR 0.874, 95%CI: 0.866-0.881) and took less sick time (RR 0.907, 95%CI: 0.901-0.912) in influenza season compared to HCWs who did not report vaccination: whereas HCWs who reported 'late' (between December 1 and March 31, and subject to masking until vaccinated) had similar sick rates to HCWs who did not report vaccination. These trends were also observed in non-influenza season. Influenza season sick rates were similar for HCWs that had at least one year of 'early' vaccination and one year where vaccination was not reported over the five year period.
   Conclusions: Overall absenteeism is lower among HCWs who report vaccination versus those who do not report. However, absenteeism behaviours appear to be influenced by individual level factors other than vaccination status. (C) 2019 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Objectives: Vaccinate-or-mask (VOM) policies aim to improve influenza vaccine coverage among healthcare workers (HCW) and reduce influenza-related illness among patients and staff. In 2012, British Columbia (BC) implemented a province-wide VOM influenza prevention policy. This study describes an evaluation of policy impacts on HCW absenteeism rates from before to after policy implementation.
   Methods: Using payroll data from regional and provincial Health Authorities (HA), we assessed all-cause sick rates (sick time as a proportion of sick time and productive time) before (2007-2011, excluding 2009-2010) and after (2012-2017) policy implementation, and during influenza season (December 1-March 31) and non-influenza season (April 1-November 30). We used a two-part negative binomial hurdle model to calculate odds ratios (OR) of taking any sick time, relative rates (RR) of sick time taken, and predicted mean sick rates, adjusting for age group, sex, job type, job classification, HA, year and vaccine effectiveness.
   Results: During influenza season, HCWs in the post-policy period were less likely to take any sick time (OR 0.989, 95%CI: 0.979-0.999) but had higher rates of sick time (RR 1.038, 95%CI: 1.030-1.045). However, during non-influenza season, HCWs in the post-policy period were more likely to take any sick time (OR 1.015, 95%CI: 1.008-1.022) but had lower rates of sick time (RR 0.971, 95%CI: 0.966-0.976). There was an overall increase in predicted mean sick rate from pre to post-policy in influenza season (4.392% to 4.508%) and non-influenza season (3.815% to 3.901%).
   Conclusions: The observed year-round increase in sick rates from pre-to-post policy was likely influenced by other factors; however, opposite trends in how HCWs took sick time in the influenza and non-influenza seasons may reflect policy influences and need further research to explore reasons for these differences.

AB The Department of Defense Global Respiratory Pathogen Surveillance Program conducted a study to compare the differences in vaccine effectiveness (VE) of the cell-derived and egg-derived vaccines. DoD healthcare beneficiaries, excluding service members, that presented with influenza-like illness for the period of 1 October 2017 through 28 April 2018 were included in a test-negative case-control study examining laboratory confirmed influenza infections. Three VE analyses were performed (1) influenza infection among those vaccinated with cell-derived vaccines (2) influenza infection among those vaccinated with egg-derived vaccines and a (3) relative VE which directly compared the odds of influenza infection with cell-derived vaccine against those with egg-derived vaccines. The cell-derived and egg-derived vaccines were moderately protective against all influenza types with significant VE estimates for all dependents at 46% (95% confidence interval, 33, 56) and 53% (45, 60), respectively. Of the subtype analyses, influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 performed the best. In the cell-derived vaccine, the adult age group was moderate to high at 71% (44, 85) and children moderate at 56% (15, 75). In the egg-derived vaccine, the children age group was at a high 88% (80, 93) effectiveness and adults at 81% (56, 92). When comparing cell-derived vaccine directly to the egg-derived vaccine, the relative VE found significant results only for influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 which favored the egg-derived vaccine with odds ratios of 2.0 (1.1, 3.6) for all dependents and 2.9 (1.3, 6.3) for children. In the influenza A(H3N2) analysis, statistical significance was not gained; however, the odds favored the cell-derived vaccine. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The amino terminus of human papillomavirus (HPV) minor capsid protein L2 harbors several conserved neutralizing epitopes, including aa.17-36 (RG-1 epitope) and aa.65-85 consensus epitope (cL2 epitope), which are considered to be promising for the construction of cost-effective pan-HPV vaccine candidates. However, the immunogenicity of L2 epitope/peptide is rather weak, and the neutralizing spectrum induced by single type of L2 antigen is suboptimal. In this study, we constructed L2 concatemer with HPV18/33/58/59 RG-1 epitopes and 16L2 aa.11-88 peptide, and fused it with flagellin, a strong systemic and mucosal adjuvant, by hypervariable region replacement. A copy of cL2 epitope was also introduced to the C-terminus of the recombinant protein. The resultant Fla-5PcL2 protein can be produced in E. coli expression system with high yield and good stability. We assessed the immunogenicity of Fla-5PcL2 in mouse model via systemic and mucosal route, and found that subcutaneous immunization with Fla-5PcL2 induced robust serum neutralizing antibodies against divergent HPV types, while intranasal immunization with Fla-5PcL2 induced remarkable L2-specific IgA and cross-neutralizing antibodies in mucosal secretions, and medium titers of cross-neutralizing antibodies in sera. Moreover, Fla-5PcL2 induced full protection against vaginal HPV challenges. As mucosal antibodies provide the first-line defense at infection sites, and needle-free immunizations may increase vaccine compliance and require less public health resources, our results demonstrate that Fla-5PcL2 is a promising vaccine candidate which possibly meet the need in low-resource regions.

AB Chitosan is a polysaccharide capable of augmenting immune responses with a proven safety record in animals and humans. These properties make it a potentially attractive agent for the prevention and treatment of infectious disease. Infection by respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the leading cause of serious lower respiratory disease in young children throughout the world. There is no licensed vaccine available against RSV whereas inactivated vaccine is known to cause enhanced respiratory disease instead of protection. Here, we investigated whether chitosan administered one or three days post-infection could protect animals against RSV infection and whether it could alter immune responses or immunopathology induced by inactivated RSV vaccine when administered twice before RSV infection. We found chitosan could modestly protect animals against RSV infection when given post-infection, while, in conjunction with inactivated RSV vaccine when given pre-infection, it could significantly reduce RSV infection in mice. Further mechanistic investigation revealed that chitosan enhanced antigen-specific immune responses through augmenting the induction of regulatory T cells, lung resident T cells and neutralizing antibodies while reversing Th2-skewed immune responses induced by inactivated RSV vaccine but, surprisingly, failing to reverse lung histopathology. Overall, this study sheds more light on the molecular mechanisms underlying inactivated RSV vaccine-induced disease. Crown Copyright (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Introduction: The consequences of low human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination in Census regions with higher incidence of cervical cancer may contribute to continued disparities. Our purpose was to evaluate regional variations in HPV prevalence across time.
   Methods: Repeated cross-sectional data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), 2003-2014 were examined. Participants included females 14 to 34 years old who provided adequate vaginal samples for HPV DNA typing (N = 6387). Region of residence and HPV vaccination status associations with HPV prevalence were examined using chi-square and multivariable logistic regression. HPV types were grouped according to vaccine-type HPV (types 6, 11, 16, 18) and risk (high or low-risk). Time and vaccination status were included in subsequent models for post-licensure survey cycles (2007-2014) to assess their effects on observed associations.
   Results: No decreases in vaccine-type HPV prevalence were found between the prevaccine cycles (20032006) and early post-licensure cycles (2007-2010, p > 0.05). Vaccine-type HPV prevalence decreased in late post-licensure years (2011-2014) compared to prevaccine years (2003-2006, p = 0.001). The highest prevalence of vaccine-type HPV occurred in the South (8.6%) and Midwest (8.6%), followed by the West (4.8%), and the Northeast (3.5%) in late post-licensure years. Lower odds of vaccine-type HPV across time in post-licensure survey cycles were found to be attributable to time, and more strongly to HPV vaccination.
   Conclusions: There were regional variations in vaccine-type HPV prevalence between prevaccine and post-licensure years. These decreases appeared to be at least partially attributable to HPV vaccination. Programs are needed to address geographical disparities in HPV vaccination. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Objectives: We assessed the vaccine effectiveness (VE) of inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV) by vaccine dose in children aged 6 months to 12 years for whom two doses are recommended in Japan to ascertain the appropriate vaccine doses.
   Methods: VE was assessed according to a test-negative case-control design based on rapid influenza diagnostic test (RIDT) results. Children aged 6 months to 12 years with a fever >= 38 degrees C who had received an RIDT in outpatient clinics of 24 hospitals were enrolled for all five seasons since 2013/14. VE by vaccine dose (none vs. once or twice, and once vs. twice) was analyzed.
   Results: In the dose analysis, 20,033 children were enrolled. Both one- and two-dose regimens significantly reduced cases in preventing any influenza, influenza A, and influenza B, but there was no significant difference in adjusted VE between one- and two-dose regimens overall (adjusted OR, 0.560 [95% CI, 0.505-0.621], 0.550 [95% CI, 0.516-0.586]), 0.549 [95% CI, 0.517-0.583], and 1.014 [95% Cl, 0.907-1.135], for none vs. once, none vs. twice, none vs. once or twice, and once vs. twice for any influenza, respectively). Both one- and two-dose regimens significantly reduced cases with any influenza and influenza A every season. Also, both regimens significantly reduced cases of any influenza, influenza A, and influenza B among children aged 1-12 years, especially among those aged 1-5 years. in the 2013/14, 2015/16, and 2016/17 seasons, however, only the two-dose regimen was significantly effective in preventing influenza B. Both one- and two-dose regimens significantly reduced cases involving hospitalization due to any influenza and influenza A.
   Conclusions: Both one- and two-doses regimens of IIV were effective in preventing influenza for children aged 6 months to 12 years. The two-dose regimen was more effective against influenza B in some seasons. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Objective: Evaluate whether a guideline recommending Live Attenuated Influenza Vaccine (LAIV) for children 2 years and older with asthma increased risks for lower respiratory events (LREs), within 21 or 42 days of vaccination, as compared to standard guidelines to administer Inactivated Influenza Vaccine (IIV) in children with asthma.
   Methods: This was a pre/post guideline retrospective cohort study of children ages 2-17 years with asthma and receiving one or more influenza vaccines in two large medical groups from 2007 to 2016. Both groups recommended IIV in the pre-period; in 2010, one group implemented a guideline recommending LAIV for all children, including those with asthma. Main outcomes were medically attended LREs within 21 and 42 days after influenza immunization. Analysis used a generalized estimating equation regression to estimate the ratio of rate ratios (RORs) comparing pre/post events between LAIV guideline and control group.
   Results: The cohort included 7851 influenza vaccinations in 4771 children with asthma. Among patients in the LAIV guideline group, the proportion receiving LAIV increased from 23% to 68% post-guideline implementation, versus an increase from 7 to 11% in the control group. Age and baseline asthma severity adjusted ROR showed no increase in LREs, primarily asthma exacerbations, following implementation of the LAIV guideline: overall aROR (95% Confidence Interval): 0.74 (0.43-1.29) for LRE within 21 days of vaccination, 0.77 (0.53-1.14) for LRE within 42 days of vaccination. For the subset of children ages 2-4 years aROR: 0.92 (0.34-2.53) for LRE within 21 days of vaccination and 0.94 (0.49-1.82) for LRE within 42 days of vaccination; for children 5-18 years aROR (95% CI): 0.58 (0.26-1.30) for LRE within 21 days of vaccination and 0.67 (0.37-1.23) for LRE within 42 days.
   Conclusion: In a large cohort of children with asthma, a guideline recommending LAIV rather than IIV did not increase LREs following vaccination. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB A high titre of maternal antibodies is one of the possible factors associated with decreased rotavirus vaccine efficacy in low-income countries where rotavirus-associated morbidity and mortality are high. Although some studies show a negative correlation between maternal antibody levels and seroconversion after vaccination, withholding breastfeeding does not improve rotavirus vaccine efficacy. Different types of recombined vaccines were developed as an alternative to produce higher protection in developing areas. In previous studies, we found that recombinantly expressed, truncated VP4* can stimulate high titres of neutralizing antibodies and can confer protection against rotavirus infections and rotavirus-induced diarrhoea. In this study, the impact of maternal antibodies on live and recombinant rotavirus vaccines (VP4*) was evaluated in a mouse model. Dams were infected orally with murine rotavirus 7 days after delivery to mimic a natural rotavirus infection in infants and to evaluate the separate effects of trans-placentally acquired and milk-acquired maternal antibodies, pups were half exchanged. After immunization with live rotavirus, both the neutralizing antibody and IgA antibody responses were inhibited by maternal antibodies, especially by milk antibodies; however, the neutralizing antibody responses after immunization with recombinant VP4* were enhanced. In addition, the in vitro incubation of VP4* with immune sera of rotavirus could also enhance the immune responses could also enhance the immune responses. Our finding provides a basis for the development of non-replicating vaccines to address the problem of live attenuated vaccines in low- and middle-income countries. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Background: Nasopharyngeal carriage of Streptococcus pneumoniae precedes disease, is the source of pneumococcal community spread, and the mechanism for herd protection provided by pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCVs). There are few PCV impact studies in low- and middle-income countries, particularly in Asia. In 2016, Mongolia introduced the 13-valent PCV (PCV13) in a phased manner using a 2 + 1 schedule, with catch-up. We aimed to assess the impact of PCV13 introduction on nasopharyngeal pneumococcal carriage and density in children in Mongolia.
   Methods: We conducted two cross-sectional carriage surveys (pre- and one year post-PCV) at community health clinics in two districts of the capital city, Ulaanbaatar in both May July 2015 and 2017. The study analysis included 961 children too young to be vaccinated (5-8 weeks old) and 989 children eligible for vaccination (12-23 months old). Pneumococci were detected by quantitative real-time PCR and molecular serotyping performed using DNA microarray.
   Findings: One year post-PCV introduction, PCV13 serotype carriage reduced by 52% in 12-23 month olds (adjusted prevalence ratio [aPR] 0.48 [95% confidence interval [CI] 0.39-0.59]), with evidence of non-PCV13 serotype replacement (aPR 1.55 [95% CI 130-1.85]), compared with the pre-PCV period. In 5-8 week olds, PCV13 serotype carriage reduced by 51% (aPR 0.49 [95% Cl 0.33-0.73]) with no significant change in non-PCV13 serotype carriage (aPR 1.10 [95% CI 0.83-1.46]). An increase was observed in both PCV13 and non-PCV13 pneumococcal density post-PCV introduction. Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) genes were common, with 82.3% of samples containing at least one of the 10 AMR genes assessed.
   Conclusion: This study demonstrates substantive PCV13 impact on pneumococcal carriage one year post-vaccine introduction in Mongolia. The reductions in PCV13 serotype carriage are likely to result in reductions in pneumococcal disease including indirect effects. Increases in non-PCV13 serotypes require further monitoring.

AB Introduction: A blood exchange transfusion (BET) is most commonly performed to treat severe neonatal haemolytic disease. A distinct form of blood transfusion adverse reaction is transfusion-related immunomodulation. The purpose of our retrospective single-centre case-control cohort study was to investigate whether a blood exchange transfusion in the neonatal period provokes immunomodulation and affects humoral immune response to vaccination, morbidity and occurrence of autoantibodies.
   Methods: Study subjects were 74 apparently healthy children, who were born at term as appropriate for gestational age and received four doses of diphtheria and tetanus toxoid vaccine. Forty-one received BET due to neonatal hemolytic disease and no other blood product afterwards, while 33 did not receive any blood products. Analysis of diphtheria, tetanus and autoimmune antibodies was performed and their medical records were analyzed for infectious, allergic, cancerous and autoimmune diseases.
   Results: A clearly exaggerated immune response to diphtheria (1.016 IU/mL, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.662-1.369 IU/mL vs. 0.515 IU/mL, 95% CI 0.363 to 0.626 P = 0.011) and slightly exaggerated immune response to tetanus vaccine (1.798 IU/mL, 95% CI 1.180-2.416 IU/mL vs. 1.036 95% CI 0.398-1.673 IU/mL, P = non-specific) were observed in BET subjects. A propensity towards autoimmunity (25.8% vs. 12.5%, P = non-specific) was observed in BET subjects. However, BET in the neonatal period did not influence the occurrence of bacterial, childhood viral diseases with exception of varicella (43.9% vs. 21.2%, P = 0.040), autoimmune and cancer diseases.
   Conclusion: BET impacted humoral immune response to diphtheria and tetanus vaccine and occurrence of autoimmune antibodies, but did not affect morbidity and the occurrence of autoimmune diseases. These effects could be related to massive antigenic load of BET and an accelerated priming of immune cells and consequent immunomodulation. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the safety, efficacy, and to clarify the mechanism of a phosphorothioated interleukin (IL)-10-targeted antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) as an immune adjuvant in intradermal vaccination. The cytotoxicity of IL-10 ASO and its ability to promote T cell proliferation were assessed by Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) assay. The contents of IL-6, IL-8, TNF-alpha, IL-1 beta, and IL-10 in inoculated local tissue and the antigen-specific antibody titers in mouse serum samples were determined by ELISA. The target cells of IL-10 ASO were observed using immunofluorescent staining. The results showed that the specific antibody titer of ovalbumin (OVA), a model antigen, was increased 100-fold upon addition of IL-10 ASO as an adjuvant compared to that of OVA alone. IL-10 ASO showed an immunopotentiation efficacy similar to that of Freund's incomplete adjuvant, with no detectable cell or tissue toxicity. In vitro and in vivo experiments confirmed that IL-10 ASO enhances immune responses by temporarily suppressing IL-10 expression from local dendritic cells and consequently promoting T cell proliferation. In conclusion, IL-10 ASO significantly enhances immune responses against co-delivered vaccine antigens with high efficacy and low toxicity. It has the potential to be developed into a safe and efficient immune adjuvant. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background: Nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHi) is one of the main respiratory pathogens associated with otitis media and lung infections in Australian Indigenous children. PHiD-CV10, the 10-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine containing H. influenzae protein D was used in the Northern Territory infant vaccination schedule for two years from October 2009.
   Methods: NTHi isolates from nasopharyngeal and ear discharge samples collected before, during and after the PHiD-CV10 era were screened for the hpd gene by PCR. Target amplicon sequence, extracted from available genomic sequence data, was analysed to identify variability in this region.
   Results: There was no statistically significant difference in the proportion of hpd#3-PCR negative isolates from each era; overall 7% and 6% of nasopharyngeal and ear discharge isolates were negative, respectively. The nucleotide sequence data supported the hpd-PCR findings; truncations of the hpd gene precluding amplification and presumably expression of protein D were observed in approximately 7% of available genomes.
   Conclusions: In the Northern Territory of Australia, a population at high risk of NTHi-associated infection, PHiD-CV10 use did not select for hpd-PCR negative isolates. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Murine antisera with neutralising activity for the coronavirus causative of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) were induced by immunisation of Balb/c mice with the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the viral Spike protein. The murine antisera induced were fully-neutralising in vitro for two separate clinical strains of the MERS coronavirus (MERS-CoV). To test the neutralising capacity of these antisera in vivo, susceptibility to MERS-CoV was induced in naive recipient Balb/c mice by the administration of an adenovirus vector expressing the human DPP4 receptor (Ad5-hDPP4) for MERS-CoV, prior to the passive transfer of the RBD-specific murine antisera to the transduced mice. Subsequent challenge of the recipient transduced mice by the intra-nasal route with a clinical isolate of the MERS-CoV resulted in a significantly reduced viral load in their lungs, compared with transduced mice receiving a negative control antibody. The murine antisera used were derived from mice which had been primed subcutaneously with a recombinant fusion of RBD with a human IgG Fc tag (RBD-Fc), adsorbed to calcium phosphate microcrystals and then boosted by the oral route with the same fusion protein in reverse micelles. The data gained indicate that this dual-route vaccination with novel formulations of the RBD-Fc, induced systemic and mucosal anti-viral immunity with demonstrated in vitro and in vivo neutralisation capacity for clinical strains of MERS-CoV.

AB Rotaviruses cause severe diarrhea in infants and young children, leading to significant morbidity and mortality. Despite implementation of current rotavirus vaccines, severe diarrhea caused by rotaviruses still claims similar to 200,000 lives of children with great economic loss worldwide each year. Thus, new prevention strategies with high efficacy are highly demanded. Recently, we have developed a polyvalent protein nanoparticle derived from norovirus VP1, the S particle, and applied it to display rotavirus neutralizing antigen VP8* as a vaccine candidate (S-VP8*) against rotavirus, which showed promise as a vaccine based on mouse immunization and in vitro neutralization studies. Here we further evaluated this S-VP8* nanoparticle vaccine in a mouse rotavirus challenge model. S-VP8* vaccines containing the murine rotavirus (EDIM strain) VP8* antigens (S-mVP8*) were constructed and immunized mice, resulting in high titers of anti-EDIM VP8* IgG. The S-mVP8* nanoparticle vaccine protected immunized mice against challenge of the homologous murine EDIM rotavirus at a high efficacy of 97% based on virus shedding reduction in stools compared with unimmunized controls. Our study further supports the polyvalent S-VP8* nanoparticles as a promising vaccine candidate against rotavirus and warrants further development. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background: While the hepatitis A virus (HAV) vaccine is recommended for United States (US) travelers to endemic regions, vaccination rates are lower among non-US-born adults and some racial minority groups.
   Purpose: We aimed to examine the relationship between birthplace, race and their interaction as predictors of self-reported HAV vaccination among adult travelers to high-risk countries (HRCs) through analysis of the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS), 2012-2015.
   Methods: The study included 36,872 US adult participants in the 2012-2015 NHIS who traveled to countries where HAV is endemic. The main outcome was self-reported HAV vaccination (>= 2 doses). Complex survey methods were applied to all models to provide statistical estimates that were representative of US adults. Multivariable logistic regression models adjusting for demographic, socioeconomic, medical, and access-to-care characteristics were fitted to examine the association between birthplace, race, race-by-birthplace (for interaction) and vaccination status.
   Results: For adult travelers to HRCs, the adjusted odds ratio (AOR) of HAV vaccination was lower for non-US-born compared to US-born adults, AOR 0.86 (95% CI; 0.76, 0.98). For Hispanics, the AOR of HAV vaccination was 0.80 (95% CI; 0.70, 0.91) as compared to non-Hispanic-Whites. Furthermore, a significant qualitative interaction between birthplace and race was found (P-value 0.0005). Among non-Hispanic Blacks, the adjusted odds of HAV vaccination for non-US-born adults were 1.35 (95% CI; 1.06, 1.72) times the odds for US-born adults. In contrast, the AORs of HAV vaccination of non-US-born versus US-born adults were 36% (95% CI; 17%, 51%) and 30% (95% CI; 12%, 44%), lower for Asians and Hispanics, respectively.
   Conclusions: The association between birthplace and HAV vaccination status differs by race among travelers to HRCs, with US-born non-Hispanic Black and non-US-born Asian and Hispanic adults having lower odds of vaccination. Health care resources should be focused on these target populations to improve travel vaccination compliance. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background: Immunization policies at colleges and universities differ greatly for many reasons, including prior experience with disease outbreaks and state immunization requirements. Few studies comprehensively explore the range of factors that influence the development of college vaccine policies or facilitators and barriers to their implementation.
   Objective: To explore the perceptions and decision-making process that influence college vaccine policy development and implementation from the perspective of student health administrators.
   Methods: This qualitative study used semi-structured interviews with student health administrators (N =10) from ten U.S. colleges and universities purposefully sampled by school type (public vs. private) and geographic region. A descriptive codebook was developed from the interview guide, and each interview was double-coded using NVivo 11 software (kappa = 0.87; inter-observer reliability = 99.4%).
   Results: We coded 5785 phrases. Administrators positively viewed their institutions' vaccine requirements, but some expressed concerns about the acceptance of philosophical and religious exemptions. They noted that students were generally ambivalent towards vaccine requirements, and while students recognized the benefits of vaccination, they did not prioritize immunizations. All administrators cited reliance on governmental and professional organizations as well as state regulations for decisions regarding vaccine requirements and recommendations at their institutions. Partnerships with other school departments, pharmaceutical companies, immunization coalitions, and healthcare providers were frequently cited as facilitators of college vaccine programs. Costs of purchasing, storing, and tracking vaccines were identified as major barriers.
   Conclusions: We identified key themes that can be evaluated in subsequent studies to identify factors associated with successful implementation of university immunization programs and inform initiatives to increase vaccine acceptance and optimize immunization rates on college and university campuses.

TI The relative effects of determinants on Chinese adults' decision for

   METAANALYSIS; PREFERENCES; ACCEPTANCE; EMOTION
AB Objectives: To assess the relative effects of altering different factors (attributes) related to adults' decision for influenza vaccination choice, and whether priming modifies these relative effects.
   Methods: Chinese adults were randomly allocated to either a control condition (non-risk related video), or one of the three health risk-priming conditions (disease (influenza) risk video, intervention (vaccine) risk video, or non-specific (air pollution) risk video), each comprising similar to 200 participants, prior to a discrete choice experiment survey. Mixed logit modelling estimated the relative effects of predetermined attributes influencing vaccination choice.
   Results: Across all four conditions, for determining vaccination choice, Vaccine Efficacy had a greater effect than social cues (community vaccination coverage rate (CVCR) and doctors' advice) but social cues can compensate for the effect of "uncertain" vaccine safety; influenza case-fatality ratio (CFR) became dominantly important among all included attributes when it reached 20%; vaccination preference increased when a CVCR changed incrementally from 5% to 60% but declined thereafter when the CVCR reached 80%. Compared with Control participants, a CVCR increased by 80% had a smaller effect for participants primed by intervention risk on vaccination choice, while the effect of influenza risk relative to vaccine risk increased following disease risk priming.
   Conclusion: While increasing confidence on vaccine efficacy is more important for influenza with less severe consequences, highlighting disease consequences becomes increasingly important when its CFR increases, for promoting vaccination uptake. For a new vaccine with uncertain safety, involving doctors and early vaccine takers to validate vaccine safety should be important. Brief exposure to influenza/vaccine risk didn't increase the effect of specific risk on vaccination choice but may change the relative weight of disease versus intervention risk when individuals make trade-off for vaccination decision. Free riding on herd immunity may increase when community vaccination coverage is high particularly following intervention risk priming. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background: Immunization services providers play a crucial role in the successful implementation of immunization, particularly for new vaccines. Several childhood vaccinations that are important for public health are not included in the National Immunization Programme in China, although they are available as optional and self-paid vaccines. Their coverage remains low.
   Objective: To examine the association between providers' knowledge and recommendations of optional vaccines, as well as other supply- and demand-side factors, and their uptake among children.
   Methods: A cross-sectional study, that included an in-person questionnaire survey for parents of children under-3 years and a self-administrative questionnaire survey for their vaccination services providers, was conducted in 36 townships or sub-districts in three provinces of China in 2013. Using a sample of 1791 household from 30 townships or sub-districts, we applied multilevel logistic analyses to examine the factors associated with the uptake of optional vaccines based on a hierarchal framework that combined demand-side and supply-side factors.
   Results: Coverage of optional childhood vaccinations varied across small areas. Supply- and demand-side factors were both associated with the uptake of these vaccines. Immunization services providers' recommendations and their knowledge about optional vaccination were positively and significantly associated with uptake. Children were more likely to receive the vaccines if they lived in communities with higher immunization worker density or larger immunization clinics. Several demand-side psychological factors about childhood vaccination were also associated with optional vaccinations.
   Conclusions: Promoting immunization services providers to conduct evidence-based recommendations about some important childhood optional vaccinations and enhancing their knowledge regarding optional vaccinations and communication skills are useful strategies to increase the coverage of these vaccinations.

AB Background: Pertussis is still frequently reported in Canada. In Alberta, pertussis incidence ranged from 1.8 to 20.5 cases per 100,000 persons for 2004-2015. Most cases occurred in those aged <15 years. In Alberta, acellular formulations replaced whole-cell in 1997. We investigated pertussis vaccine effectiveness (VE) using a test-negative design (TND) study.
   Methods: We included all persons who had a real-time PCR laboratory test for Bordetella pertussis between January 1, 2010 and August 31, 2015, in the province of Alberta, Canada. Vaccination history was obtained from Alberta's immunization repository. Vaccination status was classified as complete, incomplete, or unvaccinated, based on the province's vaccination schedule. Persons who had received >= one dose of whole cell vaccine were excluded from analysis. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to estimate adjusted odds ratios (aOR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) for pertussis infection by time since last vaccination. We adjusted for vaccination status, age, sex, neighbourhood income, urban/rural status, and the presence of a co-morbid condition. VE was calculated as [(1 - aOR) * 100].
   Results: Of the 12,149 tests available, 936 (7.7%) were positive for Bordetella pertussis. Among the full cohort, VE was 90% (95% CI 87-92%) at 1 year, 81% (95% CI 77-85%) at 1-3 years, 76% (95% CI 68-82%) at 4-7 years, and 37% (95% CI 11-56%) at 8 or more years since a last dose of acellular pertussis vaccine.
   Conclusions: Pertussis VE was highest in the first year after vaccination, then declined noticeably as years since a last vaccination increased. Our results suggest that a large number of adolescents and adults are susceptible to infection with Bordetella pertussis. Regular boosters throughout childhood, adolescence, and during pregnancy may be needed. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background: Serotype-specific vaccine efficacy (VE) against adult community acquired pneumonia (CAP) remains poorly defined, yet such data are important for assessing the utility of adult pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) programs.
   Methods: We evaluated the Community Acquired Pneumonia Immunization Trial in Adults to assess serotype-specific VE for CAP. This parallel-arm randomized clinical trial assessed 13-valent PCV (PCV13) VE among community dwelling persons aged >= 65 years in The Netherlands. In the original analysis, PCV13 VE against first episodes of vaccine-type (VT) chest radiology confirmed CAP was 45.6% (95% confidence interval [CI] 21.8-62.5%). Unlike the original analysis, we included any subject that met a clinical definition of CAP regardless of radiographic findings. VT-CAP was identified by culture (sterile or nonsterile) or serotype-specific urinary antigen detection (SSUAD) test. Only the five serotypes with at least 10 episodes in the control arm, based on the original analysis, were included for VE assessment.
   Results: Of 272 clinical CAP visits with VT serotypes identified, 253 (93%) were identified by SSUAD including 210 (77%) by SSUAD alone. VE was determined for serotypes 1, 3, 6A, 7F, and 19A, with total first episodes of, respectively, 27, 36, 25, 38, and 48. VE (95%C1) for the five evaluated serotypes against first clinical CAP episodes were: serotype 1, 20.0% (-83.1% to 65.8%); serotype 3, 61.5% (17.6-83.4%); serotype 6A, 33.3% (-58.6% to 73.2%); serotype 7F, 73.3% (40.5-89.4%); and serotype 19A, 45.2% (-2.2% to 71.5%).
   Discussion: Statistically significant VE was observed for serotypes 3 and 7F for clinical CAP among elderly community dwelling adults. The VE point estimates and Cls for serotypes 1, 6A, and 19A were lower but consistent with the overall VT-CAP VE of 45.6% previously reported. These findings may be relevant in models to accurately account for the potential impact of adult PCV13 immunization. (C) 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Anti-drug vaccines have potential as new interventions against substance use disorder (SUD). However, given the challenges seen with inter-individual variability in SUD vaccine trials to date, new interventions should ensure a robust immune response and safety profile among a diverse population. This requires accounting for sex and heritable genetic differences in response to both abused substances as well as the vaccination itself. To test response variability to our heroin-tetanus toxoid (Her-TT) immunoconjugate vaccine, we vaccinated male and female mice from several mouse strains including Swiss Webster (SW), BALB/c, and Jackson diversity mice (J:DO). Previous studies with vaccinated male SW mice demonstrated a rare hypersensitivity resulting in mice rapidly expiring with exposure to a low dose of heroin. Our results indicate that this response is limited to only male SW mice, and not to any other strain or female SW mice. Our data suggest that this hypersensitivity is not the result of an overactive cytokine or IgE response. Vaccination was similarly effective among the sexes for each strain and against repeated heroin challenge. Inbred BALB/c and J:DO mice were found to have the best vaccine response against heroin in antinociception behavioral assay. These results highlight the importance of incorporating both male and female subjects, along with different strains to mimic diverse human populations, as new SUD vaccines are being tested.

AB Introduction and objectives: The MMR vaccine was included in the official vaccination schedule in Spain in 1981. Currently, most women of childbearing age are vaccinated and have not been naturally infected. Several studies have shown that vaccinated women have a lower antibody concentration than that achieved after natural infection, and a shorter duration of transplacentally acquired antibodies in their children. The objective of this study was to determine the antibody titer in mothers and their infants at birth and throughout the first year of life under current epidemiological circumstances.
   Material and methods: Single-center, observational, descriptive and prospective study conducted between October 2013 and December 2014. One sample of serum and another of a dried blood spot on filter paper were taken from each mother. Dried blood spot samples on filter paper were taken from the children at birth, and at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months. In all the samples, levels of antibodies to the measles, rubella and mumps viruses were measured using standardized quantitative assays.
   Results: 146 mother-child pairs were included. 78.4%, 86.9% and 67.1% of mothers had antibodies to measles, rubella and mumps, respectively. A decrease in the antibody titer in children was observed after 3 months, and no antibodies against the three diseases were detected by the age of 6 months. Comparisons revealed no statistically significant differences between the antibody titers of children of mothers born before or after 1981 during the first year of their life.
   Discussion: The rapid loss of transplacentally acquired antibodies against measles, rubella and mumps, under current epidemiological conditions, suggests that bringing the MMR vaccination forward to 9 months might be justified. Larger population studies are needed to confirm these results. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

DE Febrile seizures; Algorithm validation; Vaccine safety
ID VACCINE
AB Background: The Sentinel Initiative was established in 2008 to monitor the safety of FDA-regulated medical products. We evaluated the positive predictive value (PPV) of ICD-9 codes for post-vaccination febrile seizures to identify optimal algorithms for use in post-market safety surveillance.
   Methods: We identified ICD-9 diagnosis codes for fever and seizures in the emergency department or inpatient setting after vaccinations of interest from July 1, 2010 to June 30, 2011. Medical record review was conducted to verify febrile seizure events.
   Results: Of 216 potential febrile seizures identified with one or more seizure codes (the broadest algorithm), 152 were chart-confirmed (i.e., documentation of fever within 24 h of seizure or clinician diagnosis of febrile seizure; PPV 70%, 95% CI 64, 76%). Two codes specific for febrile seizures produced the highest PPV (PPV 91%, 95% CI 85, 95%) and accounted for 140 confirmed febrile seizures. In the absence of febrile seizure codes, other seizure codes yielded much lower PPVs, regardless of the presence of fever codes.
   Conclusions: Our results indicate that ICD-9 diagnosis codes in the inpatient and emergency department settings have high predictive value for identifying febrile seizures within the Sentinel Distributed Database. While the PPV of the algorithm based on any diagnosis code for seizure is moderate, the algorithm limited to febrile seizure codes has a high PPV (>90%) and captures the vast majority of confirmed cases identified by the broadest algorithm, suggesting that the narrower algorithm limited to febrile seizure,codes may be preferred.

TI Home-based records' quality and validity of caregivers' recall of
   children's vaccination in Lebanon
SO VACCINE
LA English
DT Article
DE Vaccination; Survey; Bias; Home-based record; Recall
AB Introduction: Home-based records (HBRs) (also known as vaccination cards) and caregivers' recall are the main means to ascertain vaccination status; however, data on the quality of HBRs and the validity of recall vaccination data compared to HBRs is scarce. This manuscript presents results from two analyses related to HBRs, one on HBR pictures taken during a vaccination coverage survey, including an assessment of the HBR quality and legibility, and an evaluation of the agreement between caregivers' recall and the vaccination information in the HBRs.
   Methods: Using pictures from 500 randomly selected HBRs collected during the 2016 district-based immunization coverage evaluation survey in Lebanon, two independent researchers assessed the quality of the picture and then of the HBR itself against a pre-defined set of criteria. HBRs were classified into three types: private, public and all others. In addition, caregivers' recall was compared to data found in vaccination HBRs to assess measures of vaccination status agreement for 5713 children for whom both sources of data were available.
   Results: Over 90% of the 500 HBR pictures reviewed were considered adequate to assess the HBR quality. In the sample, most cards were type 1 (41%), followed by type 2 (34%). Most HBRs met the set criteria for quality in terms of physical condition and legibility, while, among the 28 different types of cards, vaccination cards' content and design met a moderate level of quality. Concordance, sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, and the Kappa statistic showed diverse levels of agreement for vaccination status per vaccine dose between caregivers' recall and vaccination HBRs.
   Conclusion: This study illustrates that taking pictures of HBRs in a coverage survey is feasible and useful to conduct secondary analyses related to HBRs, such as assessing their quality and comparing recall with HBRs when both sources of data are available.

AB Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) is an emerging pathogen and the causative agent of multiple cancers in immunocompromised patients. To date, there is no licensed prophylactic KSHV vaccine. In this study, we generated a novel subunit vaccine that incorporates four key KSHV envelope glycoproteins required for viral entry in diverse cell types (gpK8.1, gB, and gH/gL) into a single multivalent KSHV-like particle (KSHV-LP). Purified KSHV-LPs were similar in size, shape, and morphology to KSHV virions. Vaccination of rabbits with adjuvanted KSHV-LPs generated strong glycoprotein-specific antibody responses, and purified immunoglobulins from KSHV-LP-immunized rabbits neutralized KSHV infection in epithelial, endothelial, fibroblast, and B cell lines (60-90% at the highest concentration tested). These findings suggest that KSHV-LPs may be an ideal platform for developing a safe and effective prophylactic KSHV vaccine. We envision performing future studies in animal models that are susceptible to KSHV infection, to determine correlates of immune protection in vivo. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Rabbit hemorrhagic disease (RHD) is a lethal disease in rabbits caused by RHD virus (RHDV). Protection is only possible through vaccination. A new virus variant (RHDV2) which emerged in 2010 in France differed from the classical RHDV1 variant in certain aspects and vaccines against RHDV1 induced limited cross protection only. In a previous study, we designed a recombinant baculovirus based RHDV2-VP1 vaccine, which provided a protective immunity in rabbits against RHDV2. In the present study this newly created vaccine is characterized with regard to onset and duration of protection, and possible cross protection against classical RHDV1. Furthermore, humoral and cellular immune mechanisms in vaccinated and infected rabbits were analyzed. In all experiments, the recombinant vaccine was compared to a conventional liver-based RHDV2 vaccine.
   The RHDV2-VP1 vaccine induced a protective immune response already seven days after single vaccination and fully protected for at least 14 months. A booster vaccination 21 days after the first had a negative influence on long-term protection. The cross protection provided by the RHDV2-VP1 vaccine against classical RHDV1 was limited since only 50% of vaccinated rabbits survived the infection. Conclusively, the new, baculovirus-based RHDV2-VP1 vaccine has the potential to protect rabbits against the infection with RHDV2, blocks completely the disease progression and prevents the spread of RHDV2 at the population level.

AB Self-amplifying mRNAs (SAM)-based vaccines have been shown to induce a robust immune response in various animal species against both viral and bacterial pathogens. Due to their synthetic nature and to the versatility of the manufacturing process, SAM technology may represent an attractive solution for rapidly producing novel vaccines, which is particularly critical in case of pandemic infections or diseases mediated by newly emerging pathogens. Recent published data support the hypothesis that Antigen Presenting Cells (APCs) are responsible for CD8+ T-cell priming after SAM vaccination, suggesting cross-priming as the key mechanism for antigen presentation by SAM vaccines. In our study we investigated the possibility to enhance the immune response induced in mice by a single immunization with SAM by increasing the recruitment of APCs at the site of injection. To enhance SAM immunogenicity, we selected murine granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) as a model chemoat-tractant for APCs, and developed a SAM-GM-CSF vector. We evaluated whether the use of SAM-GM-CSF in combination with a SAM construct encoding the Influenza A virus nucleoprotein (NP) would lead to an increase of APC recruitment and NP-specific immune response. We indeed observed that the administration of SAM-GM-CSF enhances the recruitment of APCs at the injection site. Consistently with our hypothesis, co-administration of SAM-GM-CSF with SAM-NP significantly improved the magnitude of NP-specific CD8+ T-cell response both in terms of frequency of cytotoxic antigen-specific CD8+ T-cells and their functional activity in vivo. Furthermore, co-immunization with SAM-GM-CSF and SAM-NP provided an increase in protection against a lethal challenge with influenza virus. In conclusion, we demonstrated that increased recruitment of APCs at the site of injection is associated with an enhanced effectiveness of SAM vaccination and might be a powerful tool to potentiate the efficacy of RNA vaccination.

AB West Nile virus (WNV) is the most frequent mosquito-borne disease reported in the continental United States and although an effective veterinary vaccine exists for horses, there is still no commercial vaccine approved for human use. We have previously tested a 3% hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)-based WNV inactivation approach termed, HydroVax, in Phase I clinical trials and the vaccine was found to be safe and modestly immunogenic. Here, we describe an advanced, next-generation oxidation approach (HydroVax-II) for the development of inactivated vaccines that utilizes reduced concentrations of H2O2 in combination with copper (cupric ions, Cu2+) complexed with the antiviral compound, methisazone (MZ). Further enhancement of this oxidative approach included the addition of a low percentage of formaldehyde, a cross-linking reagent with a different mechanism of action that, together with H2O2/Cu/MZ, provides a robust two-pronged approach to virus inactivation. Together, this new approach results in rapid virus inactivation while greatly improving the maintenance of WNV-specific neutralizing epitopes mapped across the three structural domains of the WNV envelope protein. In combination with more refined manufacturing techniques, this inactivation technology resulted in vaccine-mediated WNV-specific neutralizing antibody responses that were 130-fold higher than that observed using the first generation,H2O2-only vaccine approach and provided 100% protection against lethal WNV infection. This new approach to vaccine development represents an important area for future investigation with the potential not only for improving vaccines against WNV, but other clinically relevant viruses as well.

AB Background: West Nile virus (WNV) is the most common mosquito-borne infection in the United States. HydroVax-001 WNV is a hydrogen peroxide inactivated, whole virion (WNV-Kunjin strain) vaccine adjuvanted with aluminum hydroxide.
   Methods: We performed a phase 1, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind (within dosing group), dose escalation clinical trial of the HydroVax-001 WNV vaccine administered via intramuscular injection. This trial evaluated 1 mcg and 4 mcg dosages of HydroVax-001 WNV vaccine given intramuscularly on day 1 and day 29 in healthy adults. The two dosing groups of HydroVax-001 were enrolled sequentially and each group consisted of 20 individuals who received HydroVax-001 and 5 who received placebo. Safety was assessed at all study days (days 1, 2, 4 and 15 post dose 1, and days 1, 2, 4, 15, 29, 57, 180 and 365 post dose 2), and reactogenicity was assessed for 14 days after administration of each dose. Immunogenicity was measured by WNV-specific plaque reduction neutralization tests (PRNT50) in the presence or absence of added complement or by WNV-specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA).
   Results: HydroVax-001 was safe and well-tolerated as there were no serious adverse events or concerning safety signals. At the 1 mcg dose, HydroVax-001 was not immunogenic by PRNT50 but elicited up to 41% seroconversion by WNV-specific ELISA in the per-protocol population (PP) after the second dose. At the 4 mcg dose, HydroVax-001 elicited neutralizing antibody responses in 31% of the PP following the second dose. In the presence of added complement, PRNT50 seroconversion rates increased to 50%, and 75% seroconversion was observed by WNV-specific ELISA.
   Conclusions: The HydroVax-001 WNV vaccine was found to be modestly immunogenic and well-tolerated at all dose levels. (C) 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB One biotechnology that can reduce nitrate concentration in subsurface drainage water is called a denitrification bed. Bromide tracer testing has been used to determine the hydraulic properties of these systems to be used in design and modeling, but efficacy of bromide tracers has not been investigated. One important hydraulic property of woodchip beds is its in-situ effective porosity. The objectives of this study were to (1) determine if bromide is a suitable tracer for evaluating the hydraulics of woodchip beds based on laboratory sorption experiments and field tracer testing, and (2) to determine the in-situ effective porosity of denitrification beds. To achieve this goal, we conducted bromide sorption experiments in the laboratory, and conducted bromide tracer testing in seven denitrification beds near Willmar, Minnesota, USA. We did not find sorption (neither adsorption nor absorption) of bromide to woodchips in our laboratory sorption experiments. In contrast, bromide tracer tests showed an average bromide recovery of 82%, revealing that bromide was retarded in the woodchip de nitrification beds. To the best of our knowledge, our experiment is the first study to estimate the in-situ effective porosity (average of 0.61) of a typical field-scale denitrification bed using a tracer test. A more accurate estimate of the actual hydraulic retention time (HRT) can be obtained by using the in-situ effective porosity rather than total porosity. Our laboratory experiment did not show any sorption of bromide to woodchips, but in contrast and for unclear reasons, our field tracer testing showed bromide retardation.

AB Grassland restored by re-vegetated shrub is an important ecosystem in desert steppe of Northwest China. Yet little is understood about the underlying eco-hydrological mechanisms for maintaining the stability of the re vegetated ecosystem. Based on the conversion relationships among throughfall, interception loss, and stemflow, we developed a method to analyze the dynamic responses of rainfall partitioning by vegetation canopies to precipitation variation, and the driving mechanisms for stemflow of two morphological distinct shrubs (unhealthy and healthy C. intermedia) during the 21 rainfall events (0-15 mm) in the period from 2016 to 2017. We found that the stemflow increased in a low-value stepwise manner with the increasing rainfall depth and eventually became scattered. Therefore, the response of stemflow to gross precipitation was divided into three stages by rainfall depth: initiation (0-2 mm), transition (2-6 mm), and scattered (6-15 mm). A significantly negative linear relationship was observed between throughfall and interception loss, while the relationships of interception loss- stemflow and throughfall- stemflow exhibited a more complex nonlinear way with relatively weaker correlations. Rainfall depth and canopy area were two main factors driving the partitioning relationships. Non-precipitation meteorological factors were dominant in the 0-2 mm rainfall events, while rainfall factors were determinant in the 6-15 mm events. Morphological factors exerted more influences on the partitioning relationships for healthy C. intermedia. Overall, the conversion between throughfall and interception loss was the majority of dynamic rainfall partitioning; therefore, low and unstable stemflow was usually inevitable. The results indicate that the precipitation threshold for stemflow generation should be a range value instead of a specific value, and the rebuilt analysis roadmaps are essential for investigating stemflow using the thorough conversion relationships and the 'stepped' approach.

AB 2009 similar to 2010 was a critical period for the Three Gorges Reservoir (TGR) transition from staged impoundment to full operation. This study reports on the composition of nutrients in the whole Changjiang and retention effect of the reservoir during the transitional period, and the potential impact of the reservoir impoundment on the eutrophication of the TGR and estuary. Water samples were collected in the mainstream and tributaries of Changjiang from August to October 2009 and June 2010 to analyze the concentrations of dissolved and particulate nutrients, and suspended particulate matter (SPM). The Changjiang was enriched with dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN), dissolved silicate (DSi) and SPM, but depleted in PO43- and biogenic silica (BSi), with higher DIN:PO43- and DSi:PO43- ratios. DIN and PO43- concentrations were lower in the Jinshajiang, but increased in the Mid-downstream of the Changjiang due to high human activities and nutrients import from major tributaries. DSi concentration varied little along the Changjiang, and was relatively low in the TGR. Particulate inorganic phosphorus (PIP), total particulate phosphorus (TPP) and BSi concentrations were very high in the Jinshajiang, and then dramatically decreased with the SPM in the TGR. The northern tributaries contributed more nutrients to the Changjiang than the southern tributaries. Depending on the nutrients input-output mass balance model, the retention of nutrients in the TGR were higher for TPP and BSi, lower for dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) and dissolved organic phosphorus (DOP). Total dissolved nitrogen (TDN), total phosphorus (TP) and DSi retained in the reservoir accounted for 15%, 12% and 1%, respectively of the TDN, TP and DSi fluxes in the Datong station near the estuary. Historical data showed that the impoundment of the TGD greatly contributed to the eutrophication of the reservoir and estuary. Since 2003, algal blooms were likely to occur in the TGR, estuary and adjacent seas, but the outbreak frequency and area of red tides in the East China Sea (ECS) dramatically decreased. Therefore, further study is required to estimate the response of estuarine ecosystem on the dispatching mode of the TGR.

AB Formation of soil crusts results in reduced infiltration, increased runoff, and reduced rainfall and irrigation efficiency. Improved knowledge of the hydrological properties of soil crusts is required to improve simulation of infiltration and soil water movement in crop-soil-water models. Development of soil crust algorithms in soil water models is limited by a lack of in situ and laboratory approaches for measuring the physical properties of soil crusts. In this study we evaluate a number of novel and modified approaches for determining changes in the hydraulic properties of soil crusts formed in an intensively cropped sandy loam. Physical crust formation over a 71 day period resulted in an increase in surface soil density from 1.17 to 1.51 g cm(-3), a reduction in infiltration from 474 to 33.2 mm h(-1), and a decrease in unsaturated hydraulic conductivity at - 0.05 kPa from 136.9 to 10.14 mm h(-1). Whilst the ability to determine the van Genuchten properties of soil crusts was progressed, uncertainty with matching crust thickness to sampling depth, and difficulty measuring the total porosity of soil crusts resulted in error and uncertainty in the estimation of the theta s parameter and to a lesser extent the alpha and eta parameters. Further work is required to improve the development of simple, in situ means of measuring or estimating the physical properties of soil crusts.

AB Various methods have been proposed to define the rainfall thresholds for the landslide prediction. Once the threshold is determined, it remains the same regardless of the antecedent soil moisture conditions. However, given the important role of the antecedent soil moisture in the initiation of landslides, it is considered if the rainfall threshold level varies according to the antecedent soil moisture conditions, the prediction performance will be improved. Therefore, in this study we propose a probabilistic threshold to integrate antecedent soil moisture conditions with rainfall thresholds. In order to take into account the conditions with landslides and without landslides, the Bayesian analysis is applied to estimate the landslide occurrence probability given the various combinations of two factors: the antecedent soil moisture and the severity of the recent rainfall event. These combinations are then divided into conditions that are likely to trigger landslides and those unlikely to trigger landslides by comparing their probabilities with a critical value. In this way, the probabilistic threshold is determined. Here the soil moisture is estimated using the distributed hydrological model, and the severity of the rainfall event is characterized by the cumulated event rainfall-rainfall duration (ED) thresholds with different exceedance probabilities. The proposed approach was applied to a sub-region of the Emilia-Romagna region in northern Italy. The results show that the probabilistic threshold has a better prediction performance than the ED rainfall threshold, especially in terms of reducing false alarms. This study provides an effective approach to improve the prediction capability of the ED rainfall threshold, benefiting its application in the landslide prediction.

AB Quantifying vertical flows in long-screened or open wells is essential for their reliable use in all types of groundwater investigations. In ambient conditions, a flow profile shows the producing/receiving zones of head-driven flow, the relative vertical head gradient in the aquifer system and potential bias in chemistry samples. A flow profile while pumping can be used to quantify aquifer heterogeneity and the sampled water mixtures. This paper describes a novel approach to a single-well tracer test to quantify the flow regime in a pumped well, which is unique in its utility over a wide range of discharge rates. During constant pumping, a tracer is injected at the opposite end of the well and, as it is drawn towards the pump, the tracer is diluted in proportion to each inflow. A dilution model using the advection-dispersion equation is used to visually fit a flow profile that explains all tracer profiles (pre-injection, transient phase and steady-state). Results compare favourably to borehole EM flowmeter data, particularly if tracer density issues are correctly interpreted and head-loss in the flowmeter is avoided. A dimensionless Froude number is provided to assist both with understanding and minimising the role of free convection when planning all types of in-well tracer tests involving a density contrast. Like the flowmeter, this method is particularly suited to screened wells, where packers are ineffective. Used together or separately in existing wells, these in-well methods can provide considerable information on aquifer-well hydraulics without the cost of additional drilling.

AB We rely on various Global Sensitivity Analysis (GSA) approaches to detect the way uncertain parameters linked to diverse conceptual geological models influence spatial distributions of hydraulic heads in a three-dimensional complex groundwater system. We showcase our analyses by considering a highly heterogeneous, large scale aquifer system located in Northern Italy. Groundwater flow is simulated considering alternative conceptual models employed to reconstruct the spatial arrangement of the geomaterials forming the internal makeup of the domain and characterizing the distribution of hydraulic conductivities. For each conceptual model, uncertain factors include the values of hydraulic conductivity associated with the geomaterials composing the aquifer as well as the system boundary conditions. We explore the relative influence of parametric uncertainties to steadystate hydraulic head distributions across the set of conceptual models considered by way of three GSA methodologies, i.e., (a) a derivative-based approach, which rests on the Morris indices; (b) the classical variance based approach, grounded on the evaluation of the Sobol' indices; and (c) a moment-based GSA, which takes into account the influence of uncertain parameters on multiple (statistical) moments of a given model output. Due to computational costs, Sobol' and moment-based indices are obtained numerically through the use of a model order reduction technique based on the polynomial chaos expansion approach. We find that the sensitivity measures considered convey different yet complementary information. The choice of the conceptual model employed to characterize the lithological reconstruction of the aquifer affects the degree of influence that uncertain parameters can have on modeling results.

TI Reducing uncertainty of design floods of two-component mixture

AB The conventional flood frequency analysis typically assumes the annual maximum flood series (AMFS) result from a homogeneous flood population. However, actually AMFS are frequently generated by distinct flood generation mechanisms (FGMs), which are controlled by the interaction between different meteorological triggers (e.g., thunderstorms, typhoon, snowmelt) and properties of underlying surface (e.g., antecedent soil moisture and land-cover types). To consider the possibility of two FGMs in flood frequency analysis, researchers often use the two-component mixture distributions (TCMD) without explicitly linking each component distribution to a particular FGM. To improve the mixture distribution modeling in seasonally snow covered regions, an index called flood timescale (FT), defined as the ratio of the flood volume to peak value and chosen to reflect the relevant FGM, is employed to classify each flood into one of two types, i.e., the snowmelt-induced long duration floods and the rainfall-induced short-duration floods, thus identifying the weighting coefficient of each component distribution beforehand. In applying the FT-based TCMD to model the AMPS of 34 watersheds in Norway, ten types of mixture distributions are considered. The design floods and associated confidence intervals are calculated using parametric bootstrap method. The results indicate that the FT-based TCMD model reduces the uncertainty in the estimation of design floods for high return periods by up to 40% with respect to the traditional TCMD. The improved predictive ability of the FT-based TCMD model is attributed to its explicit recognition of distinct generation mechanisms of floods, thereby being able to identify the weighting coefficient and FGM of each component distribution without optimization.

AB The east-central North China Plain (NCP) is a globally representative area that presents a sharp contradiction between deep groundwater exploitation and grain production. Evaluating the effects of limited irrigation on crop water productivity (WP) and deep groundwater exploitation reduction in this area is important for developing sustainable agricultural practices. In this study, the 11 limited irrigation scenarios were simulated and analyzed using the distributed Soil-Water-Atmosphere-Plant-WOrld-FOod-STudy (SWAP-WOFOST) model that was established, calibrated and validated in a companion paper; the recommended irrigation timing for maximizing the yield or WP of winter wheat was selected; the irrigation scheme for minimizing evapotranspiration constrained by 14 winter wheat yield reduction thresholds was optimized separately; and further the effects of the optimized irrigation scheme on saving water and reducing deep groundwater exploitation were evaluated. The results showed that the recommended irrigation timing was predominantly in the pre-sowing, booting to anthesis and early grain-filling stages for three irrigations, the pre-sowing and booting to anthesis stages for two irrigations, and the booting to anthesis stage for one irrigation. Adopting the optimized irrigation scheme with the threshold of 60% could achieve the goal of reducing deep groundwater exploitation by 6.05 x 10(8) m(3) but reduced winter wheat yield by approximately 50%. The contribution index of reducing exploitation (CIRE) was defined to identify the contribution of implementing the optimized irrigation scheme to reducing current deep groundwater exploitation. At the related water resource subregional level, the CIRE values showed that this contribution was relatively higher in the related Tuhai and Majia Rivers plain (THMJHP), the related plain of the Zhangwei River basin (ZWHP) and the related plain of the Ziya River basin (ZYHP). Following the framework of simulation-optimization-evaluation, the three results at the manageable county level, namely, the optimized irrigation scheme under the constraint of 14 thresholds, the crop yield variation compared with the current irrigation schedule and the CIRE values, provide decision-making references for implementing limited irrigation for winter wheat under local conditions to achieve the target of deep groundwater exploitation reduction.

AB Remote sensing, as a crucial method to obtain information on water environmental processes, has become a major source of data, particularly of water environment and water resources, which are sensitive to global climate change. The bibliometric analysis provided here shows the research characteristics and developments of remote sensing-based observations of water environmental processes under a changing climate from 2000 to 2018. Visualized knowledge mapping is introduced to investigate the development status, scientific collaboration, involved disciplines, research hotspots and emerging trends of this field. The breadth and depth of remote sensing application in water environmental process studies have improved significantly as the number of related publications rose at an average annual growth rate of 15.97% in the 21st century. The United States and China were the leading contributors with the largest number of publications and all of the top 15 most active institutions. In addition, this field is a highly interdisciplinary field that covers a wide range of interests, from water resources to environmental science, geology, engineering, ecology, and agriculture. The application of remote sensing technology has significantly promoted the estimation of evapotranspiration and soil moisture, thereby offering a more complete perspective to the understanding of the water cycle. Additionally, climate change and its complex interactions with water environmental processes, including the occurrence of drought events, are of great significance and require special attention.

   COMPONENTS; FOREST; LAYER
AB The freeze-thaw cycle in the active soil layer plays a crucial role in cold-region hydrological processes, yet the effect of vertical water migration caused by the soil frost on shallow groundwater remains poorly quantified. The shallow groundwater level (GWL), soil frost depth and main environmental controls were monitored in a humid alpine meadow on the northeastern Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau from 2012 to 2017. GWL fluctuated with two seasonal maxima and minima during soil frost-centric year from November to October. GWL declined remarkably from the strong peak (3.9 +/- 0.2 m, Mean +/- S.D.) in mid-January to the strong minimum (4.8 +/- 0.1 m) in mid-May, and then increased to the second peak (4.2 +/- 0.2 m) in late August. This seasonal variability in GWL was mainly attributed to the freeze-thaw processes of the lower layer soil frost from November to late June both at a similar to 45-day delay, respectively. The clear increasing GWL from mid-November to mid-January was probably related to the melted upper layer soil frost, which was detained in subsoil layers because of the high thermal isolating effect in topsoil Mattic Epipedon (dense organic-rich turf) and the associated negative subsoil profile temperature gradient from mid-May to late August. The seasonal N-type in GWL was thus hysteretically determined by the soil freeze-thaw processes and the related subsoil profile temperature gradient. Annually, GWL was significantly correlated with air temperature (R-2 = 0.88, P = 0.003, N = 6), suggesting the shallow groundwater recharges would be weakened under the warming scenario. Annual GWL was not directly connected with annual precipitation (P = 0.81), likely owing to the high water holding capacity of the topsoil Mattic Epipedon and the similarity between precipitation input and evapotranspiration loss. This critical buffering function of the topsoil Mattic Epipedon in vertical moisture movement should be taken into consideration when modeling regional water dynamics in humid alpine meadows.

AB Forests act as 'pumps' through their evapotranspiration (E-tot) and as 'sponges' by enhancing soil infiltration capacity and moisture retention. Tropical deforestation and poor post-forest land management generally result in lower E-tot, but also reduce infiltration. Strongly diminished infiltration is typically accompanied by enhanced overland flow and can cause reduced groundwater recharge and baseflows. A grid-based land surface hydrological model (W3RA LUM) was tailored to incorporate the trade-offs between the 'pump' and 'sponge' effects to investigate where deforestation can be expected to have the greatest impacts on dry-season flows. Streamflow sensitivity analyses for scenarios with or without full forest cover and/or good versus poor surface infiltration were performed for: (i) selected tropical catchments with documented changes in streamflow after deforestation; and (ii) the tropics at large (23.5 degrees N to 35 degrees S, to include important seasonal montane forests). The catchment sensitivity analyses showed that W3A LUM captured the streamflow response to imposed deforestation and changes in surface conditions reasonably well. For the tropics as a whole, an increase in mean annual streamflow of 18% was obtained for forest conversion (to pasture) only, versus 26% after an additional imposed reduction in surface infiltration. Much of the inferred flow increases concerned water-limited regions. A reduction in dry-season flows was predicted for nearly one-fifth of all grid cells (despite lower E-tot after forest conversion) after impaired infiltration, marking potential 'hot spots' of hydrological change after deforestation and reduced infiltration due to surface degradation. The affected grid cells shared the following key characteristics: (i) strong seasonality; (ii) high infiltration capacity under forested conditions; (iii) sufficient wet-season precipitation to recharge deep soil- and groundwater stores; (iv) sufficient soil water storage under forested conditions to 'carry over' infiltrated wet-season rainfall into the subsequent dry season; and (v) slow groundwater recession maintaining baseflow throughout the dry season.
   Our results demonstrate that forest removal in highly seasonal tropical catchments, whilst typically increasing mean annual water yield, can indeed decrease dry-season flows, depending on pre- and post-forest removal surface conditions and groundwater response times.

AB In the last few decades, the northern region of Iraq has been severely impacted by climate change, which has created long-term drought, water shortage, and casual flood events. Dam construction in suitable sites is a primary water management strategy to solve flood and drought. Dam site selection depends on a set of qualitative and quantitative criteria, such as geology, soil type, and altitude. In this study, appropriate areas of dam site selection for water management were identified using remote sensing, geographic information system (GIS), and multi-criteria decision making techniques. In addition, the proposed method of site suitability was evaluated by comparing it with the traditional analytic hierarchy process (AHP). A new validation method to evaluate the accuracy of AHP and fuzzy logic according to the preselected location of a darn was previously suggested in the study area (Bekhme darn) by the local government. Remote sensing data (Landsat imageries and ASTER DEM) and field/reference maps were used to derive 12 conditioning factors needed to produce a suitability map for construction. The criteria considered were geological formation, soil type, fault line, tectonic line, altitude, slope, rainfall data (2000-2011), water discharge, land use/cover, road network, and material used for dam construction. Two mathematical models, namely, AHP and fuzzy logic, were applied in this study. The best model was selected by using location and cluster-based accuracy assessment depending on the proposed dam site (i.e., Bekhme dam). Results showed that fuzzy logic is more accurate than AHP. In terms of the surface area of suitable lands identified, the AHP model determined 13,446,900 m(2) as a highly suitable area, whereas the fuzzy model identified 3,409,200 m(2) from the total area of 69,347,700 m(2). Finally, this study identified four sites for intermediate and large dams in the study area. The total water capacities of proposed Dam 1, Dam 2, Dam 3, and Dam 4 are about 81.5, 239.3, 374.6, and 646.5 million m(3), respectively, when the dam height is 60 m. The proposed methods can be easily replicated to other areas for similar applications. The finding reveals that AHP model is distributed and scattered in the whole study area, whereas the fuzzy model is more suitable for clustered areas.

AB Low impact development (LID) practices can mitigate adverse impacts of urbanization on hydrology and water quality by using decentralized designs to control stormwater runoff at the source. Most previous research has focused on LID impacts on stormwater runoff with little consideration given to baseflow or road salt pollution. This study describes a modeling approach to assess how effectively retrofitted LID technologies can reduce salt contamination. The model coupled the curve number approach with completely mixed reservoirs to simulate watershed hydrology and solute transport. The model was tested in Boone Creek Watershed (BCW), an urban headwater watershed in the Southern Appalachians. The model proves able to capture daily stream discharge and stream chloride (Cl-) concentrations satisfactorily. The model simulation with and without LID showed LID can decrease surface runoff and increase recharge, baseflow, and interflow. Furthermore, LID led to increased Cl- load in baseflow, interflow, and recharge. Cl- load in runoff and maximum stream Cl- concentration decreased when LID is implemented. The model was run with retrofitting scenarios of various LID practices including pervious pavement, swales, rain gardens/cisterns, bioretention systems, green roofs, disconnecting conveyances from impervious surfaces, and all LID practices combined in BCW. Implementing LID reduced storm runoff by 0.21-27.8% and increased groundwater recharge by 0.05-6.26%. Mean stream Cl- concentrations stayed unchanged while the maximum stream Cl- concentration decreased by 0.03-4.78% after LID practices were implemented. The results also suggest that pervious pavement might be the best retrofitting option, particularly in commercial and high-density residential areas in BCW and other similar urban watersheds. Overall, our study suggests that LID practices could mitigate stream salt contamination by dilution from enhanced groundwater recharge. Our study further suggests this model could be used as a quick screening tool to determine an effective strategy for implementing LID practices in urban areas.

AB This study provides experimental evidence of Forchheimer flow and transition between flow regimes from the perspective of particle uniformity coefficient. We have designed two series of experiments to investigate the particle size control on Forchheimer flow, including two kinds of quartz sands with mixed particle sizes according to different mass ratio, and five particle sizes mixed according to different uniformity coefficients. For the experimental results of two mixed particle sizes, the critical Reynolds number (Re) corresponding to the transition of flow regimes increases with the increase of coarser particle content. Besides, deviation from Darcian flow has been observed from experimental results of mixed five particle sizes. Specifically, the pre-Darcian flow regime, or non-Darcian flow at low velocity in which the "pseudo" hydraulic conductivity increases with Re, has not been observed, where the "pseudo" hydraulic conductivity is defined as the ratio of the specific discharge over the hydraulic gradient. However, the post-Darcian flow regime, or non-Darcian flow at high velocity in which the "pseudo" hydraulic conductivity begins to decrease when Re reaches a certain value, has been identified. In contrast, above observations are absent in experiments using single-size particles even when the size of the single-size particles is the same as the mean size of the mixed-size particles. A greater discrepancy among the particle sizes in the mixed-size particles used in the flow experiments results in a lower "pseudo" hydraulic conductivity even when the mean size of the mixed-size particles remains the same. The degree of deviation from the Darcian flow has been quantified, and the relation between a newly defined Reynolds number for Forchheimer flow (Re-F) and the friction factor are constructed. Our experiments show that when Re-F is greater than 0.1, the experimental data begin to deviate from Darcian flow considerably. This study shows that the uniformity coefficient of porous media, which is a term used to describe the pore size distribution, is a critical factor for determining the flow regimes besides the mean particle sizes.

AB It is computationally difficult to model unsaturated flow through a highly fractured rock system that contains porous rock matrix, densely distributed fracture networks and narrowly spaced drainage holes. We present an efficient numerical procedure that uses a three-dimensional, finite-element model to solve Richards' equation with embedded zero-thickness elements for fractures and line elements for drainage holes. A mixed boundary condition is applied at potential seepage surfaces and a water retention relation with extremely narrow unsaturated zone is specified to precisely locate the phreatic surface. The procedure compares favorably with results from other numerical solutions and experimental data. A case study is developed to evaluate seepage through a densely fractured rock slope. The simulated results demonstrate that fractures disorder the hydraulic potential distribution with fracture patterns acting as significant influential factors and drainage holes dramatically lower the phreatic surface due to the effects of drainage and depressurization. The proposed numerical procedure shows to be capable of investigating the unsaturated flow in highly fractured rock mass.

TI ERT and salinity - A method to determine whether ERT-detected

AB The identification of preferential flow generation and the tracking of their pathways in agricultural soils are challenging tasks, in particular while keeping the soil profile undisturbed. The noninvasive electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) method seems, a priori, to be an ideal tool for these purposes, but the simultaneous dependence of soil electrical resistivity (ER) on soil moisture content and salt concentration poses a problem when high-salinity water is involved. The dependence of these variables is expressed, for example, by Archie's law. Irrigation with brackish or treated wastewater are two such complicated cases. The latter has been found to render soils water-repellent with inherent flow in preferential pathways. A method that resolves this complication is developed and applied for in-situ-measured ERT data. This method combines a model that simulates the preferential ER(t) as a series of interconnected well-mixed units (WMUs) with frequent ERT scans during soil wetting and subsequent drying. Following validation by comparison of its output to simulations using the Richards equation for flow and convection-dispersion equation for transport, the WMU model was used to simulate scenarios of simultaneous variations in moisture content, salinity, and ER(t) in a well-mixed soil volume (unit). The characteristic patterns acquired by these simulations were compared with in-situ measured ER(z,t) to determine whether the observed preferential ER pathways coincide with preferential flow or salinity pathways, or both. From the eight sections in the profile where this analysis was made for, five exhibit preferential flow, characterized by fast wetting front propagation that includes by-passing of a certain soil volume, while the wetting front velocity in the other three was moderate. We, therefore, concluded, based on the water content/salinity effect on ER, that the measured preferential ER pathways coincide with preferential flow pathways. Salinity has, for the current case, a minor, if any, effect on the ER spatial variation. Therefore, ERT is an advantageous mean of mapping of preferential flow pathways in the soil profile, and the method developed herein can be used for studying the water distribution in the soil profile. Particular irrigation design and management can be then used to ease the negative effects of preferential flow pathways on soil water availability to plant roots and the enhanced leaching of agrochemical below the active root zone.

AB Groundwater is the most important water resource in arid regions. However, the groundwater traditional models and field measurements are limited due to the fluctuations in hydrological cycles and the difficulty in the accurate quantification of associated parameters. Here, we hypothesized that maximum potential tree height could be used to predict groundwater depth due to the hydraulic limitation of water transportation. To address this hypothesis, we measured two proxy indicators of maximum potential tree height, i.e, the maxima of heights and volumes, of three common dominant tree species in northwest China to construct classical measurement error (CME) model for predicting groundwater depth in an arid region. Our results showed that the optimal model based on maximum tree height had the best predictive performance of groundwater depth, particularly the tallest plant species. The CME model showed that maximum tree height played a vital role in predicting groundwater depth. Mathematically the model can be expressed as: [E(ln(Dw)vertical bar ln(Th), theta) = 7.11 - 1.85E (x vertical bar ln(Th), theta), where Dw and Th are respectively the theoretical values of groundwater depth and maximum tree height; xis the measured maximum tree height; theta = {7.11, -1.85, 7.19, 0.15, 1.91, 13.45}; R-2 = 0.82; Marginal log-Likelihood = -131.04; RMSE = 0.33]. In addition, Leave-One-Out Cross-Validation together with correlation analysis indicated that groundwater depth prediction based on maximum tree height in arid regions was an accurate and promising approach. In conclusion, our study showed that the hydraulic limitation of water transportation led to a negative relationship between maximum tree height and groundwater depth. Our developed model for predicting groundwater depth with maximum tree height has provided the important basis for the conservation and management of groundwater resources in arid regions.

AB A decrease in soil water content (SWC) has been observed at the global scale and has led to a reduction in evapotranspiration (ET). However, the trend in SWC in eastern Asia differed from the global trend, and this may be due to the overlapping of warm/wet seasons. Because of the limitation of deep soil water content data, especially in drylands, changes in SWC and the correlation between SWC (particularly deep SWC) and ET remain poorly understood. In this study, spatial distribution of correlation coefficient (r) between SWC and ET were calculated based on reanalysis data and remote sensing data, which were validated by in situ data (2004-2005) and sampling data (2016-2017). Firstly, the correlation between SWC and ET decreased with soil depth. The depth of the sharp decrease was 10 cm based on in situ monitoring data (2005-2008) and spatial sampling data (2016-2017). Secondly, the spatial correlation between SWC and ET varied with different vegetation cover types. The correlation increased from the western typical steppe to the eastern forest. The highest values of r were in a forest-covered area, because it had the highest water uptake capacity. However, the difference between r_10 and r_100 (D_r) showed a different spatial pattern, and the lowest negative D_r value was obtained from a forest-grass transition zone in which the enhanced vegetation index showed a significant increasing trend. The significant negative regression determination coefficient (R-2 = 0.9, p < 0.01) between B_(EVI) (0-0.1) and D_r indicated that the narrowed D_r in the transition zone was due to the vegetation increase. This meant that more deep soil water was taken up into the atmosphere. Thus, the deep SWC could become unstable and deep soil could become drier, which would be unsustainable for the ecosystem.

TI Uncertainty analysis of a pollutant-hydrograph model in assessing inflow

AB Rain-derived Inflow and rain-induced infiltration (RDI and RII) is a serious problem in urban drainage systems. Cost-effective and simplified RDI and RII estimation methods have been developed such as the conductivity based method, nonetheless the parameter uncertainty had seldomly been analyzed. In this paper, an uncertainty analysis was proposed for a pollutant-hydrograph model developed for assessing RDII based on wastewater conductivity. The uncertainty and sensitivity of model parameters were analyzed using the Generalized Likelihood Uncertainty Estimation (GLUE) method. Different model scenarios including rainfall types, rainfall events, and different sewer systems were simulated in this model. The model results indicate the confidence of inflow and infiltration rate (Ran,, Ran) in residential area is much higher than that in the pump stations and WWTPs. The distribution disparity of RRDI and RRII also reflects the physical characteristic of the sewer network, which can be used to analyze sewer conditions such as pipe damages and misconnections. This novel conductivity-based method shows its improved performance compared to the traditional flow-based methods with supportive RDII data.

AB River confluences are pivotal junctions that have vital influences on hydraulic characteristics and sediment particle distributions as well as on hyporheic water exchange. However, hyporheic water exchange is poorly understood because of the complicated river morphology within a river confluence. Therefore, the river confluence between the Juehe River and Haohe River located in arid and semi-arid areas of northwestern China was selected to evaluate the hyporheic water exchange processes, and the temperatures of different depth sediment were measured on July 11th and 12th, 2016 by an instrument equipped with five temperature sensors. The patterns and magnitudes of hyporheic water exchange were estimated using a one-dimensional heat transport model coupled with temperature data. Meanwhile, terrain points elevations and sediment particle distributions in this river confluence were collected to determine the confluence riverbed morphology. Furthermore, the river confluence morphology effects on hyporheic water exchange were investigated in this study. The different riverbed morphology and hydrodynamic zone locations were observed, which were controlled by the planform geometry with low river confluence flux momentum during the test period. Meanwhile, the upwelling flow dominated in the test area, and the downwelling occurred at three of the 23 total test points, which was induced by the complicated riverbed morphology and hydraulic characteristics. Additionally, the magnitudes of the upwelling flow were significantly influenced by the sediment heterogeneity subjected to the erosional and depositional processes. Hyporheic water exchange is a vital hydrological process in arid and semi-arid areas, where it significantly impacts the ecological environment of rivers. This study provides a valuable guideline for water quality and quantity management in arid and semi-arid areas.

DE Sustainable sanitation; Decentralization; Stormwater management;

ID WATER MANAGEMENT; STRATEGIES
AB At present, increasing requirements for both the efficiency and environmental sustainability of resources demand more knowledge about the feasibility of the implementation of innovative technologies both in a large-scale as well as in the long run. Even at modified sewage flows and characterizations, water infrastructures must always remain reliable to guarantee sustainable urban water management. Dimensioning methods and assessment variables must be adapted to achieve more flexible systems in the long-term. This paper aims to assess the actual impact of the implementation of New Alternative Sanitation Systems (NASS) as well as stormwater decentralization measures in an existing sewage disposal system with means of a dynamic simulation within a 50-year time interval in 10 years steps. Two scenario simulations showed that the implementation of the module for blackwater and greywater separation with an assumed pollutant fractionation represents the investigated sustainable sanitation measures reliably. Results showed a decrease in the overflow discharge loads and duration of the control stormwater infrastructures. The WWTP showed a successful chemical oxygen demand (COD) and total nitrogen elimination (TN) in all cases. Nonetheless, operational flexibility is fundamental in order to cope with the more unfavorable COD:TN ratios of the WWTP inflow after full implementation of NASS. To sum up, implementing this simplified approach for a stepwise implementation of resource-oriented sanitation technologies allows a dynamic integrated system evaluation not only for dry weather conditions but also for stormwater conditions.

AB Residence Times in aquifers result from their internal structure, from the hydrodynamic transport processes and from the recharge conditions to which they are exposed. Beyond the already known residence time distributions (RTD) for either constant aquifer thickness and/or uniform recharge, we investigate the effect of both distributed aquifer thickness and distributed recharge. We develop a semi-analytical approximation of the RTD for generic trapezoidal aquifers exposed to linearly-variable recharges. The solution is derived for a homogeneous 2D cross-sectional aquifer in steady-state conditions following the Dupuit-Forchheimer assumption according to which the vertical head gradients are much smaller than the horizontal head gradients. Close agreement with 2D numerical simulations demonstrates the relevance of the Dupuit-Forchheimer assumption to estimate RTDs as long as the aquifer thickness remains an order of magnitude smaller than the aquifer length. At equivalent aquifer volume, geometrical structure and recharge conditions result in non-trivial and complex RTD shapes that may be uniform, Gamma-like, power-law-like shapes as well as any intermediary shapes. The variety of RTD shapes encountered show the need to systematically include the aquifer structure and recharge conditions in the assessment of RTDs and for their subsequent use for problematics related to water quality. The semi-analytical approximation can be further used in a variety of aquifer systems in complement with other existing solutions as a Lumped Parameter Model for RTDs.

AB Water resources are essential for survival of both the ecosystem and human society in arid regions. The impact of precipitation on vegetation cover, especially in arid and semiarid areas, has received increasing interest. Although correlation between precipitation and vegetation cover has been reported in arid and semi-arid areas (with annual precipitation from 50 to 200 mm and from 200 to 400 mm, respectively), it is unclear whether the same correlation holds in extremely arid regions (with annual precipitation less than 50 mm). This study used remote sensing data of precipitation and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) to investigate their correlation at different temporal and spatial scales in a typical arid mountain-oasis river system located in northwest China. The results showed that precipitation and NDVI are not evenly distributed in space. In the period 1999-2007, precipitation was declining at a rate of 1.1785 mm/year, while during 2008-2015, it has increased at a rate of 2.0516 mm/year. NDVI showed no significant temporal trend in most areas (trend slope = 0.001, Significance > 0.05), except for a slight increase in regions where cropland expanded. The Pearson correlation coefficient between the time series of spatial mean precipitation and NDVI over the whole study area was 0.46 (Significance < 0.01), suggesting strong effects of precipitation on NDVI in the study area. The correlation coefficient between precipitation and NDVI varied spatially with the precipitation pattern in space. Through analysis of phase difference in space and time, it was found that NDVI in the lower reaches of the river system was significantly correlated with accumulative precipitation of the current and previous two months in the upper reaches of the system. Our study shows that the impacts of precipitation on vegetation cover have a clear phase difference in space, and that in an extremely arid area, antecedent precipitation in an adjacent region upstream has strong influences on vegetation cover downstream. Thus, the spatial distribution and antecedent accumulation of precipitation impacts should be taken into consideration when analyzing vegetation dynamics in arid areas.

AB The importance of representing the spatial structure of rainfall accurately has been emphasized in various hydrological studies. It has also been widely acknowledged that there is a need to account for uncertainty in rainfall input. Common approaches focus on accounting for either point measurement or sampling uncertainty in rainfall estimation. We present a method that jointly considers three sources of uncertainty affecting the space-time mapping of rainfall: point measurement, sampling and neighborhood uncertainty. To our knowledge, neighborhood uncertainty has not been included in any prior rainfall uncertainty analysis. We generated an ensemble of 400 realizations of daily rainfall fields at a 2 km x 2 km spatial resolution for a catchment in Western Denmark (1055 km(2)). At the core of our method is the sequential Gaussian simulation (SGS) technique. Results indicate that our approach is able to reproduce key statistical features of the rainfall distribution. We examined the impact of different spatial (grid and catchment) and temporal supports (one day, one month, 5-year period) on the overall uncertainty. We also quantified the effect of each uncertainty source on rainfall field uncertainty. Finally, we compared our simulation results with those of a parallel expert elicitation study. We found that the expert elicitation uncertainty for average catchment rainfall in a 5-year period was considerably larger than quantified in our study (CV of 1.1% vs. 5%). An even larger discrepancy was found for the 5-year average of gauge rainfall, where expert elicitation resulted in a value that was an order of magnitude higher (CV of 0.2% vs. 2%). Possible reasons for this gap are discussed.

AB Heterogeneities in textural properties of surficial formations at field scale result in spatial variations in hydraulic parameters governing unsaturated zone flow. This study aims at quantifying the influence of such variations on solute transport resulting from a localized source of radioactive contaminant at ground level.
   The study focuses on three hydraulic parameters related to the Mualem-van Genuchten formalism, namely the saturated hydraulic conductivity K-s, the parameter a inversely proportional to the air-entry value, and the parameter n related to the pore-size distribution. Sets of random fields accounting for spatial variability of these parameters are generated using lognormal distributions with different variances and correlation lengths. These random fields are used as inputs to an unsaturated flow and transport model to simulate radionuclide plume migration.
   Each simulated plume is characterized by its size (plume surface area), position (location of center of mass) and shape (elongation ratio) within the unsaturated zone. By comparison with the homogeneous medium, K-s-, alpha- and n-random fields generated with the mean variances computed through the analysis of a global soil database respectively result in average in (i) 25 (variable K-s), 20 (variable alpha) and 65% (variable n) increase in plume size; (ii) 0.8, 1 and 1.8 m horizontal offsets of the plume center; and (iii) 20, 30 and 50% decrease in plume circularity. In addition, changes in the variance values within one order of magnitude appear to have critical consequences only for the n parameter.
   The issue of spatial variability of hydraulic parameters is thus crucial for characterizing the evolution of pollutant plumes within an unsaturated zone and for developing better remediation strategies for industrial sites.

TI A new station-enabled multi-sensor integrated index for drought

AB Remote sensing data are frequently incorporated into drought indices used widely by research and management communities to assess and diagnose current and historic drought events. The integrated drought indices combine multiple indicators and reflect drought conditions from a range of perspectives (i.e., hydrological, agricultural, meteorological). However, the success of most remote sensing based drought indices is constrained by geographic regions since their performance strongly depends on environmental factors such as land cover type, temperature, and soil moisture. To address this limitation, we propose a framework for a new integrated drought index that performs well across diverse climate regions. Our framework uses a geographically weighted regression model and principal component analysis to composite a range of vegetation and meteorological indices derived from multiple remote sensing platforms and in-situ drought indices developed from meteorological station data. Our new index, which we call the station-enabled Geographically Independent Integrated Drought Index (GIIDI_station), compared favorably with other common drought indices such as Microwave Integrated Drought Index (MIDI), Optimized Meteorological Drought Index (OMDI), Precipitation Condition Index (PCI), Temperature Condition Index (TCI), Soil Moisture Condition Index (SMCI), and Vegetation Condition Index (VCI). Using Pearson correlation analyses between remote sensing and in-situ drought indices during the growing season (April to October) from 2002 to 2011, we show that GlIDi_station had the best correlations with in-situ drought indices. Across the entire study region of the continental United States, the performance of GIIDI_station was not affected by common environmental factors such as precipitation, temperature, land cover and soil conditions. Taken together, our results suggest that GlIDLstation has considerable potential to improve our ability of monitoring drought at regional scales, provided local meteorological station data are available.

AB Many semi-arid regions of the world experience rainfall patterns characterized by high spatial variability. Accurate spatial representation of different types of rainfall will facilitate the application of distributed hydrological models in these areas. This study presents a daily, spatially distributed, stochastic rainfall generator based on a first-order Markov chain model, calibrated using 50 years of rainfall observations at 88 gages from 1967 through 2016 in the 148-km(2) Walnut Gulch Experimental Watershed. Three types of rainfall, including convective, frontal, and tropical depression storms, were simulated separately in the generator using biweekly parameterization. Convective storms were simulated based on an elliptical shape rain cell conceptual model, whereas frontal and tropical depression storms were simulated as uniform rainfall fields over the whole watershed with introduced random variability. The rainfall generator was evaluated by comparing the mean statistics of 30 sets of 50-year simulated data versus the 50-year rain gage observed data. Most individual storm statistics and aggregated seasonal rainfall statistics were similar to the measured rainfall observations. The long-term mean values of both summer and winter rainfall amount were statistically satisfactory. This model can serve as a guide for application in areas with convective, frontal, and tropical depression storms.

AB In order to advance our understanding of the driving factors controlling carbon dynamics and evolution of water quality in river-reservoir systems for the generation of hydropower, we conducted a study in a karst deep-water reservoir (Wujiangdu Reservoir), southwest China. Water samples were collected from the inflow/outflow of the Wujiangdu Reservoir, four vertical columns along the reservoir, and from three tributaries to the reservoir in January, April, July, and October 2017. The dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) concentrations and carbon isotope composition (delta C-13(DIC)) varied greatly (1.99-3.45 mmol/L and -10.7 parts per thousand to -6.0 parts per thousand, respectively) and were controlled by multiple processes including CO2 outgassing, primary production, and organic matter degradation. In the four vertical profiles, the difference between the values of samples with those at 15 m of Delta[DIC] and Delta[delta C-13(DIC)], Delta[DIC] and Delta Ca2+ in the same water column had positive correlations, and the variation in dissolved O-2, partial pressure of CO2, and flux of CO2 suggested that primary production dominated above the epilimnion and degradation of OM dominated below the epilimnion during the warm season. Continuous CO2 outgassing was found from riverine water to surface water of the reservoir before the dam based on carbon isotopic compositions and water chemistry. These processes would cause isotopic fractionation between the residual DIC and CO2 (aqueous), the degree of which varied among different seasons (July > April > October > January). Carbon transport and biogeochemical processes were highly controlled by the hydraulic retention time (HRT) in the river-reservoir system. It was estimated that approximately 71.5% of the annual DIC flux was produced in the water column below 15 m depth during the study year, suggesting that the processes of DIC generation and consumption occurred at the same time. The results highlight that carbon behavior in the impounded rivers is influenced by multiple processes. The carbon transformation processes should be taken into account for improving the estimation accuracy of the carbon budget calculations and the management of water quality for river-reservoir systems.

AB Lateral seepage can be an important water loss pathway at the field level and a conduit for the discharge of pesticides and nutrients from rice fields. However, few studies have directly measured lateral seepage rates in flooded rice fields. This study sought to characterize the magnitude and variability of lateral seepage in California rice fields, and to explore the relationship between lateral seepage and soil properties or hydrologic conditions. Lateral seepage was measured during the growing season at 50 locations spread across six rice fields using a methodology that operates analogously to a double-ring infiltrometer. Lateral seepage rates varied over four orders of magnitude (0.05-33.11 cm(2) h(-1) or 0.0011-1.05 cm h(-1)), though even the highest rate measured was small compared to typical water inputs in California rice fields, and lateral seepage corresponded to only 1.0%-1.9% of water inputs at sites where irrigation inputs were measured. Lateral seepage was negatively correlated with levee width (p = 0.025) and the relative water height in the adjacent field, supply canal, or drainage ditch (p = 0.045), though this relationship explained little of the variation in lateral seepage rates (marginal r(2) = 0.129). Contrary to expectations, not all supply canals or higher flooded fields were a source for lateral seepage into fields, as unsaturated zones present in most levees served as a sink for lateral seepage from both sides of the levee. Future research should examine the prevalence of preferential flow pathways in rice field levees and the potential for transport of nutrients or agrochemicals through these flow pathways.

AB The changes of soil properties caused by ecosystem restoration have played critical roles in controlling water and sediment loss in Loess Plateau. However, it is difficult to isolate and quantify the individual impact of each factor as the impact is hard to monitor separately. The objectives of this study are to explore how the changes in different soil properties influence the hydrologic response and sediment transport at catchment scale. We applied a coupled hydrologic-sediment transport model to a small catchment in the Loess Plateau. Sensitivity analyses were conducted on three influential soil properties: saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ks), Manning's roughness coefficient (n) and the variations of erodibility coefficient (phi). Our results indicated that the increase in near surface saturated hydraulic conductivity could effectively reduce the peak and total flow (i.e. when Ks is smaller than rainfall intensity, 22.5% increase in Ks leads to over 70% reduction in total discharge), and could lead to transition of runoff generation mechanism from Horton Overland Flow to Dunne Overland Flow. The increase in Manning's roughness coefficient would also reduce the discharge and sediment yield substantially by slowing down the flow velocity which leads to more infiltration along the flow path after the runoff is generated. The decrease in erodibility coefficient reduces the sediment rate and total sediment mass delivered (i.e. 20% decrease can reduce total sediment mass by 5%), alleviating the undercutting in upstream gullies and deposition at downstream, eventually slowing down landscape evolution. Our findings could be used to provide valuable guidance in the ecosystem restoration and land use management.

AB The coordination of social economy, water, and ecology is an important foundation for sustainable development. However, the interaction among social economy, water, and ecology are complex. The data scales between socioeconomic factors (normally at the spatial scale of the administrative region and the temporal scale of a year or month) and river water quality and ecological factors (normally at the spatial scale of a sub-basin and the temporal scale of an instantaneous value) do not match. Therefore, many current regulation methods do not sufficiently consider the interaction mechanisms between socioeconomic, water, and ecological factors or cannot adequately deal with the scale of the data. In this study, we proposed a new framework to assess the coordinated development of social economy, water, and ecology (SWE) by integrating the distributed social economy-water ecological model (SEWE) and the harmonious regulation model. We built the SEWE model by coupling a rainfall runoff model, river water quality, and ecological models; we built the harmonious regulation model based on the harmony theory method. We applied the proposed method and framework to the Shaying River Basin, which exhibited typical characteristics of multiple sluices and dams, high pollution, and significant human activities. Results indicated that the coordinated development level of the SWE in the Shaying River Basin was poor, with the average coordination degree varying from 0.39 to 0.60. The average growth rate of the coordination degree of socioeconomic indicators was greater than that of the river water quality and ecological indicators. The coordination degree of water ecological indicators was small with a decreasing trend. These results indicated the increasing impact of socioeconomic development on river water quality and ecology. Therefore, the Shaying River Basin should focus on ecological and environmental restoration, such as the effective control of pollution draining into rivers. The proposed methods and framework could contribute to the integrated water resource management of the basin.

AB Agriculture accounts for 90% of global freshwater consumption and it is expected to intensify in the future. Climate and land use changes are two major factors affecting crop green and blue water consumption, and in this study we explicitly consider the effects of both factors in a consistent modeling framework. Two important research questions are addressed: 1) How will global crop green and blue water consumption evolve over the 21st century under climate and land use changes; and 2) what are the individual and combined effects of climate and land use changes on future crop green and blue water consumption? To tackle these two questions, a crop water use module is developed based on the Global Change Assessment Model (GCAM) and its hydrology module (i.e., Xanthos). Crop specific green and blue water consumption are then calculated at global 0.5 degrees x 0.5 degrees grid scale. Results show that global crop green water consumption increases by 12% in 2090s when compared with that in 1971-2000, and climate change dominates over land use change in determining the trend of global crop green water consumption. However, expansion in global irrigated area dominates the changing trend of global crop blue water consumption which increases 70% by 2090s, especially in regions with significant irrigated land expansion (e.g. northern Africa, central Asia, China, Mexico, the Middle East, Russia, southern Asia, and Argentina). Furthermore, global crop blue water dependence will increase under climate and land use changes, especially in arid regions.

AB Reservoir operation plays an important role in the coevolution of the nexus across water supply, power generation, and environment (WPE) systems. This paper aims to contribute to the state-of-the-art in how multi objective reservoir operation can be modeled within the framework of the WPE nexus by incorporating the interactions among reservoirs operation, stakeholders' decision preferences, and WPE systems. Specifically, five ordinary differential equations are used to describe the dynamics of WPE states. These dynamics are driven by a multi-objective optimization model that optimizes reservoir operation decisions. Two novel response linkages that describe how the reservoir operational decisions influence socio-economic variables and how the environmental awareness influences stakeholders' preference for reservoir operation are proposed in this study. The Middle Route of China's South-to-North Water Transfer Project is selected as the case study. The results show that: (1) response linkages are effective in describing the interactions between reservoir operational decisions and WPE systems, (2) tradeoffs across WPE systems and reservoir operational decisions shift from stage to stage because of the changing socio-economic conditions, and (3) the control parameter that dominates the shift in stable levels of a given variable can be identified. These results highlight the importance of re-evaluating involved tradeoff effects and updating of operational policies periodically, and how our modeling approach can be used to detect and guide such adaptions.

AB A number of past studies have investigated the influence of various teleconnections - such as El Nino-Southem Oscillation (ENSO), the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) and the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) - on precipitation and streamflow. These studies, however, have not focused on analyzing the combined influence of the different phases of these teleconnections and the simultaneous influence of these teleconnections at differing time-frequency scales. The present study addresses this issue by exploring the use of wavelet-based methods in combination with non-parametric approaches to analyze individual and combined influences involving ENSO, NAO, and PDO on monthly precipitation and streamflow data from watersheds in Alberta, Ontario, and Newfoundland, in Canada.
   This study is the first time that multiscale and multivariate analyses of ENSO, NAO, and PDO, along with their different phases, are used to explain the variability of streamflow and precipitation in a watershed. Generally, the positive and negative phases (particularly of ENSO and NAO) were respectively associated with lower and higher precipitation/streamflow, while the neutral phase showed similar behavior to that of the negative phase. The results of the bivariate and multivariate wavelet coherences revealed that there were consistent increases in the average wavelet coherence (AWC) and the percentage of significant coherence (PoSP) for all watersheds, from using only one factor to two and three teleconnection factors. The ranges of AWC for one, two and three factors were 0.31-0.40, 0.56-0.66, and 0.77-0.81, respectively. The ranges of PoSP for one, two and three factors were 3.54-14.3, 28.38-47.29, and 69.28-76.71, respectively. This implies that three-factor combinations (ENSO-NAO-PDO) were needed to explain the variability of precipitation and streamflow in all watersheds.

AB To better understand the effects of climate change on streamflow, the hydrologic response to both temperature and precipitation needs to be examined at the mesoscale. New York State provides a hydrologically diverse mesoscale region, where sub-regional clusters of watersheds may respond differently to changes in temperature and in seasonal precipitation rates. Connections between streamflow and climate were examined for 97 gaging stations across the state and surrounding areas, for a historical period of 56 years of daily average streamflow. Gages were grouped into clusters if their mean annual discharge rates were strongly correlated to one another. Within each cluster, sharp temporal changes in discharge, or change points, were identified. These change points clustered both spatially and by flow regime, with low, medium, and high flows increasing around 1970 for much of the state consistent with other studies in the region. A step increase in Catskill low flows in 2003 coincides with increases in summer precipitation, and is consistent with a positive correlation between summer precipitation and annual low flows. Our results support previous studies that have shown that streamflow at this mesoscale is strongly tied to precipitation, and the strength of that connection is modulated by land cover, geographic position, and seasonal moisture conditions. Across the state, the winter-spring center of volume date has moved earlier along with increasing January streamflow rates, the result of warmer winter temperatures and an increased proportion of precipitation as rain. The transition to a post-1970s pluvial period also coincided with more frequent peak over threshold flows statewide, and this wetter period has continued to the present day.

AB Changes in vegetation growth may influence the availability of water resources. Located on the Tibetan Plateau, the Yarlung Zangbo River Basin (YZRB) is a major freshwater source for Tibet, China and downstream South Asian countries, with high spatial heterogeneity in altitude and climate from the upstream to downstream regions. In this study, we combined satellite-based gridded datasets of the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), topography, precipitation, and temperature to investigate how vegetation growth has changed in the YZRB over recent decades (1982-2010), and to determine their driving mechanisms. Although a statistically significant trend in growing season NDVI was not detected at the basin scale, at the pixel scale 16.8% and 5.3% of the area of the YZRB was found to exhibit increasing and decreasing trends, respectively. The greatest increases occurred in the Nyang subbasin. Variations of NDVI values along elevation, precipitation, and temperature gradients revealed the greatest variation over the middle ranges of the three variables. Partial correlation analyses indicate that in both arid and semi-arid regions of the YZRB precipitation is positively correlated with NDVI. The relationship between NDVI and temperature varies with aridity, reflecting different effects of snow-melting processes on vegetation growth. Temperature positively correlates with NDVI in the arid region. In addition, a negative correlation between NDVI and temperature is detected in the semi-arid region. This is the first comprehensive study to explore climate-vegetation-hydrology relationships in the YZRB at a spatial resolution finer than those derived from sparse in-situ meteorological stations or low resolution global climate datasets. Our results are valuable for understanding ecohydrological processes in both arid and semi-arid regions of this internationally important river basin.

AB Fluorosis is an endemic disease that is now a global challenge. In this review paper we have classified and described the global fluoride belts (GFB) geologically and geographically connecting different countries. A proper map of the global fluoride belts showing the inland connections between each belt is presented. Several natural factors like the rock type, soil, tectonics, hydrogeology and climate of a terrain which are majorly responsible for engrafting higher fluoride in drinking water are described. A detailed uniform description of each belts with respect to geology, geochemistry are discussed. The minor factors like altitude, phosphate mining etc. on fluorosis are also discussed including countries like Canada, Norway etc. which are potentially affected by fluorosis. The correlation of different ions like Cl-, Ca2+, etc; pH, electrical conductivity, TDS etc are compared and reviewed in detailed with respect to different GFB. The genesis and sources of fluoride contamination are also supported by different isotopic evidences. In this article, the in situ methods involving natural minerals and materials which can adsorb fluoride effectively and are being used globally are exhaustively assessed. The methods which are highly sustainable with minimum waste generation and cost effective are also evaluated.

AB Reservoir inflow estimation is important in flood control operation. Reservoir inflow includes three components, namely, upstream, tributary, and lateral inflow. However, the lateral inflow, which has a significant contribution to reservoir inflow during flood seasons, is difficult to estimate in regions where precipitation or meteorological data are lacking. A reverse model based on the adjoint equation method (AEM) was proposed to improve the estimated accuracy of reservoir inflow without using rainfall data. The model inverted the lateral inflow on the basis of observed hydraulic characteristic data, such as water levels and discharges. The AEM, which is considered an optimization method, determines the optimal lateral inflow by minimizing misfits between the observed and simulated data. The capability of the AEM was verified by two synthetic examples with varied boundary conditions. After running the forward model to solve one-dimensional Saint-Venant equations, the resulting water level hydrographs were used as known observations for the inversion. The practical applicability was tested by reproducing a historical flood event of the Three Gorges Reservoir by using water level data and outflow hydrograph. Results demonstrated that the AEM could successfully invert lateral and reservoir inflows by using observed data and has practical applicability in complicated reservoirs.

AB Soil hydraulic properties play a primary role in water infiltration and movement, and transport of nutrients and contaminants through the soil profile. However, the determination of soil hydraulic properties, especially the hydraulic conductivity at lower depths within the soil profile is very challenging. We investigated the use of inverse modelling based on APSIM (Agricultural Production Simulation Model) to determine likely ranges of the hydraulic conductivity at saturation (K-sat) and field capacity (K-DUL) for a slowly permeable subsurface horizon. Simulations were run for the poorly drained Otokia silt loam, in the Otago region of New Zealand. APSIM simulations were set up either according to the site specific soil profile description or based on the national soils database (S-map) pedotransfer functions. Simulated temporal soil moisture data were compared to measurements from a field experiment. Within a sensitivity analysis K-sat values of the subsurface soil were varied from 2.4 to 192 mm/d, and values for K-DUL from 0.05 to 1 mm/d. Finally simulations were run over 45 years using three climatic conditions, with annual rainfall amounts of 582, 628 and 730 mm. The effect of varying the hydraulic conductivity of the subsurface fragipan horizon (C-x) on the wetness status of the overlying B-2g horizon was determined by calculating the average annual duration of soil moisture above field capacity. These were then used to estimate ranges of the hydraulic conductivity that contributes to a soil being imperfectly or poorly drained. The results highlight the significant influence that K-DUL, has on the reliability of modelling the hydraulic behaviour of soils with slowly permeable subsoils.

AB Evapotranspiration (ET) plays an important role in determining the available water resources of a basin. In past decades, the Heihe River basin (HRB) in Northwest China has suffered severe water crisis and ecological problems due to large land cover changes (LCCs), especially oases expansion for irrigation agriculture. This study quantifies the ET variations due to LCCs in the HRB from 2000 to 2015 using the Ecological Assimilation of Land and Climate Observations (EALCO) model and detailed LCC measurements. Large variations in ET with land cover type is seen in the HRB. In the past fifteen years, crop expansion from bare soil or desert grass caused most of the increase in ET, while the conversion of alpine grass to desert grass caused most of the decrease in ET. As a result, a net 1.03 billion m(3) of increased water consumption per year resulted from the overall LCCs in the HRB. This increased water use for ET largely intensified the water crisis in the HRB and deteriorated the health of the downstream ecosystems. Our results show that the water consumed in crop expansion can be used to recover almost ten times the area of the degraded desert grass ecosystem. A stricter policy that limits agriculture expansion is recommended in land use planning for a sustainable ecosystem development in the basin. This study also helps to better understand ET changes from LCCs and manage the limited water resources for sustainable ecosystem development in other arid regions of the world.

AB Riparian zones adjacent to revetments, as the last position of the entire riparian, are the last barrier to intercept runoff nitrogen pollution. They are also the areas where hyporheic exchange occurs when soil is submerged by river water. Revetments can be classified into impervious revetments and permeable revetments according to their permeability. It has been realized that impervious revetments are not conducive to exchange between rivers and riparian zones. Tidal riparian zones undergo water level changes more frequently than normal riparian zones. Thus, revetments in tidal riparian zones may have a greater impact on nitrogen cycling. However, the quantitative influence of revetment types on nitrogen removal in adjacent tidal urban riparian zones is not clear, resulting in the lack of scientific support for the revetments construction. Removal of nitrogen from riparian zones primarily occurs through plant uptake, microbial immobilization, and denitrification. However, nitrogen will be released into soil again after plants die or microorganisms decompose. While denitrification can completely remove nitrogen through transferring nitrate (NO3-) into gaseous nitrous oxide (N2O) and dinitrogen (N-2). In this study, we used three revetment types (permeable concrete pile revetments (PR), impervious masonry stone revetments (IR), and no revetments (NR)) as examples to quantify the effects of revetment types on soil denitrification in adjacent tidal urban riparian zones at three distances from the revetments (0.3 m, 0.6 m, 1.0 m) by measuring the soil (0-20 cm) denitrification potential (DP) and N2O production rates (N2OR). Results indicated that compared with soil denitrification (0.32 +/- 0.06 mg kg(-1)h(-1)) in natural riparian zones (NR), PR could significantly improve it (0.97 +/- 0.07 mg kg(-1)h(-1)), while IR significantly inhibited it (0.23 +/- 0.04 mg kg(-1)h(-1)) in the adjacent tidal urban riparian zones (P < 0.01). Changes in soil properties caused by revetment types accounted for the differences in soil denitrification. Soil organic carbon (SOC) was a main direct chemical factor, and soil texture was a main indirect physical factor. Based on these results, revetments construction did not necessarily inhibit soil denitrification in natural riparian zones, and priority should be given to building permeable revetments to improve the soil denitrification provided by the riparian ecosystem.

AB Growing demand for biomass-derived fuels has resulted in an increase in bioenergy projects in recent years, a trend that is expected to continue. However, broad expansion of bioenergy feedstock production may have significant environmental consequences. Accordingly, the goal of this study is to investigate how forest-based bioenergy development may affect hydrological systems at the watershed scale. Specifically, this study addresses hybrid poplar cultivation for biofuel production in a snow-dominated watershed in northern Wisconsin, USA. The Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT), calibrated and validated for streamflow and biomass production cycles, is used to evaluate the effects of land use change corresponding to a range of biofuel development scenarios. The biofuel scenarios follow physically-based rules for land use conversion to poplar plantations from hay, pasture, and forested lands; along with a suite of alternative management practices, including rotation time, planting density, fertilizer application and irrigation. Trade-offs between biomass production, fertilizer use, and hydrologic alteration are evaluated for the feedstock production system. The highest density (1111 trees/100 m(2)) and shortest rotation (5-year) treatments produce the highest biomass and are the most efficient treatments in terms of water and fertilizer use per ton of biomass. The high efficiency is due to optimal relationships between leaf area index, biomass production, and N uptake. At annual or greater time scales, the simulated conversion to poplar had minimal effect on ET and streamflows. However, in summer months, the ET from the poplar substantially exceeds that of the original land use, so that streamflows decrease by as much as 50%. Irrigation to meet soil water deficits increased biomass production, but only by 4% on average, which is not surprising for a temperate, humid watershed.

AB Aquatic carbon (C) loss is mostly driven by in-situ mineralization of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and leads to autonomous carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions to the atmosphere. However, limited studies have examined the biodegradability of riverine DOC, especially for the initial trophic controls of DOC biodegradation (%BDOC) and variations in dissolved organic matter (DOM) chemical composition. In this study, we employed a laboratory incubation experiment to determine the riverine %BDOC, temperature sensitivity (Q(10) value), nutrients and DOM optical properties in a subtropical river in the Dry-hot Valley Region. We observed the %BDOC at 30 degrees C (52 +/- 19.8%) was significantly higher than that at 20 degrees C (34 19.9%) with an average Qio value of 2 +/- 1.7. Decreases in a(254), a(350) values indicated that the aromatic and lignin fractions were decomposed, while increases in E2:E3 and decreases in E4:46 values suggested that large molecular DOMs were incompletely degraded and accumulated after 56-day incubations. The %BDOC was negatively correlated with the DOC:TDP ratio, which suggested that P availability was a dominant control in aquatic microbial respiration. Our results conclude that temperature and trophic status regulate biodegradability of DOC, and also stimulate the incomplete degradation of recalcitrant fraction in DOMs.

AB Analytical solutions of groundwater dynamics in an elongated aquifer subjected to general time-dependent recharge are presented. The lateral boundaries are specified heads with the head variations governed by general time-dependent functions. General recharge function was not considered in previous works of this kind. Both single and double-porosity aquifers are considered. The solution is obtained using Fourier sine and Laplace transformations, followed by an inverse Fourier-Laplace transform involving residue theorem and convolutional integral. For the unconfined single-porosity aquifer case, the exact time-domain solution is obtained using the residue theorem; for the unconfined double-porosity aquifer case, the time-domain head is calculated using the de Hoog inverse Laplace algorithm. The presented solution can be used to estimate the hydraulic parameters of 1) groundwater head variation of a river basin aquifer subjected to general lateral head variation and recharge; 2) groundwater head variation in a double-porosity elongated fractured anticline; 3) groundwater depletion of an elongated fractured anticline subjected to recharge due to rainfall or snowmelt to its adjacent alluvial aquifer. In addition, the presented solution can be utilized to optimize the irrigation pattern in a cropland between two trench drains to control the groundwater mound.

Creating a range of essential data from digital database repositories aids the development of decision support tools for urban planners in a simulation of different urban drainage scheme scenarios and moderates the interference with other infrastructure utilities. These tools, modelled with design software and GIS platform, are tested in two case studies; the results revealing essential improvements in accuracy of output, time taken to prepare and run the model and model presentation which visualised the hydraulic design results and global location of the drainage layout on an urban master plan.

AB Glaciers in the upper Indus supply more than half of the river water, are experiencing significant melting with a debated fate. The recent melting rate is still contained by considerable uncertainties, hindering to estimate precise glacier mass change. Here we present geodetic mass balance results for the whole Indus Basin using SRTM and ALOS 30 m elevation data, improved glacier inventory, optimized glacier surface density, and validation through in-situ differential GPS and ICESat data. Our glacier inventory and derived by improving RGI6.0 boundaries and separated into debris cover and debris free parts. The derived surface elevation changes were converted into annual mass balances using separated density assumptions (four criteria) for debris-covered ice (900 +/- 60 kg m(-3)), debris-free ice (below 20 degrees and 25 degrees slopes (850 +/- 60 kg m(-3)) and above 20 degrees and 25 degrees slopes (600 +/- 60 kg m(-3))), respectively. The resulting mass balance biased between -0.20 and 0.09 m water equivalent (w.e.) a(-1) using an average (850 +/- 60 kg m(-3)) density assumption throughout the Indus Basin. In the western Himalaya and Hindu Kush, the glacier mass losses are less affected by the average density assumption compared to the Karakoram. The western (Hunza) and central (Shigar) Karakoram glaciers show negligible mass losses of -0.02 +/- 0.12 and -0.01 +/- 0.13 m w.e. a(-1) in contrast to the relatively more negative mass balance (-0.26 +/- 0.21 m w.e. a(-1)) in the eastern (Shyok) Karakoram. All the sub-basins exhibit negative mass balances, with the most negative values ranging from -0.34 +/- 0.31 to 0.44 +/- 0.27 m w.e. a(-1) in the Ravi, Chenab and Jhelum sub-basins of the Himalaya. The whole Indus Basin contributes approximately +0.014 +/- 0.016 mm a(-1) to the global mean sea-level equivalent.

AB Groundwater dating information is important for safety assessment for geological disposal of high-level radioactive waste. Radiokrypton (Kr-81) is an excellent tracer for dating old groundwater with a residence time up to 1 Ma. We have optimized a hollow-fiber-based device for extracting Kr-81 from deep groundwater with low hydraulic conductivity for the purpose of estimating its residence time. Such a device must show a high Kr extraction efficiency and an ultra-low level of contamination from modern air and must allow for in situ evaluation of Kr extraction efficiency. The optimal devices reported herein showed minimal contamination by Kr-81 from modern air, and the efficiency of Kr extraction from high-salinity groundwater exceeded 90%. Furthermore, we confirmed that the Rn-222 was a suitable indicator of Kr extraction efficiency.

AB The 2015 Chennai (India) flood event claimed many lives and incurred an economic loss of $2.2 billion. Simulation of such a destructive flood event in an ever growing urban sprawl and changing climate is of great importance for better flood preparedness and management of the city. In that light, this study aims to (a) study the 2015 Chennai flood event and (b) simulate the occurrence of a similar event in future, considering both urban sprawl and increased rainfall resulting from climate change effects. The baseline scenario is generated using freely available hydrologic (HEC-HMS)-hydraulic (HEC-RAS) models and the results are validated with observed flood-mark data. Historical land use and land cover maps of the study area are used to train an Artificial Neural Network model for constructing spatially varying urban sprawl scenarios. The hydrologic model is run for the increased rainfall and urban sprawl scenarios to generate flood hydrographs, which are then used as inputs to the hydraulic model for simulating possible flood inundation patterns. The simulations indicate that the average increase in inundation extent considering the worst possible urban sprawl solely, and that taken together with extreme rainfall, are 20 and 33 percent, respectively. Furthermore, the analysis shows that on an average 1.7 times more number of buildings are exposed to flood hazard under the worst case combined scenario in comparison to the baseline scenario. This study, therefore, demonstrates the importance of considering urban sprawl, in addition to changes in rainfall, for evaluating the worst possible consequences of flooding of a city. Considering the uncertainties involved in the study, the presented results may be considered as "what-if' scenarios for planning suitable flood mitigation measures for the city of Chennai.

AB The agro-hydrological Soil-Water-Atmosphere-Plant-WOrld-FOod-STudy (SWAP-WOFOST) model in a distributed manner represents an important tool for evaluating agro-hydrological cycles and irrigation strategies at different spatiotemporal scales. The reliability of the model simulations and evaluations is dependent on the generation of the distributed simulation units that account for the spatial heterogeneity of various factors, as well as parameter calibration and model validation. In this study, we focused on the most typical overexploited deep groundwater area in the North China Plain (NCP). First, the extended Fourier amplitude sensitivity test (EFAST) was used to conduct global sensitivity analyses for three modules in the SWAP-WOFOST model to identify the parameters that significantly influence the objective variables for calibration at the six experimental stations in the study area. On this basis, the parameters were calibrated and validated in detail using abundant observed data from each station. The normalized root mean square error (NRMSE) values for soil water content, soil salt concentration, winter wheat leaf area index (LAI), winter wheat aboveground biomass, winter wheat yield, summer maize LAI, summer maize aboveground biomass and summer maize yield were 14.93%, 27.20%, 24.60%, 25.27%, 23.12%, 24.55%, 21.33% and 17.94%, respectively, during the calibration period; and the corresponding NRMSE values were 16.26%, 29.36%, 24.20%, 22.75%, 21.77%, 22.03%, 24.38% and 18.62%, respectively, during the validation period. The model provided a good simulation for the soil water contents and summer maize yields and a fair simulation for the other objective variables. Furthermore, a distributed SWAP-WOFOST model was generated by overlaying 12 maps involving meteorology, soil, crops, land use, water resources and administrative divisions, yielding 2809 simulation units. Finally, the simulation accuracy of the distributed model was evaluated under the current irrigation conditions. The results showed that the simulated yields of winter wheat and summer maize were consistent with the statistical values, and the simulated evapotranspiration matched the remote sensing data with acceptable precision. In summary, the distributed SWAP-WOFOST model could be used as an effective tool for simulating crop water productivity in time and space under limited irrigation scenarios and for evaluating the effect of optimized limited irrigation schemes on reducing deep groundwater exploitation in this region.

AB Determination of electrical conductivity of soil pore-water from measurements of soil bulk electrical conductivity and volumetric water content or dielectric permittivity, requires theoretical or empirical models connecting these quantities. One such model is the salinity index model, which in the original formulation requires the measurement of soil bulk electrical conductivity and apparent dielectric permittivity determined with the time-domain-reflectometry (TDR) technique. Currently, many popular soil moisture sensors are operated at a single frequency, usually in the low-frequency part of the typical TDR bandwidth. Yet, no systematic verification of the salinity index model applied with the use of dielectric permittivity measured at specific frequencies in a broad frequency range has been performed. The aim of this paper is to evaluate the salinity index model with the use of dielectric spectra of 277 samples of 14 soils obtained in a 20 MHz-3 GHz frequency range with the use of a coaxial transmission-line cell vector-network-analyzer system. A three-pole Debye model was fitted to the spectra in order to determine bulk electrical conductivity and the real part of dielectric permittivity at chosen frequencies in order to diminish the influence of measurement errors. Then, the salinity index model was applied at each examined frequency and its soil-specific parameters were calculated. The performance of the model was evaluated with the use of the leave-one-out cross-validation scheme, and the frequencies at which the model performed best were found within 0.5-2 GHz range. Finally, the salinity index model parameters obtained at the optimal frequencies were correlated with other soil properties.

AB Increasing water demand aggravates water scarcity in water-scarce regions (e.g., India, Pakistan, and China), where uneven precipitation increases the risk of maintaining sustainable eco-economic development. Ignoring precipitation's effects leads to misguided policy recommendations that either deplete or underuse basin water resources. Therefore, this paper highlights the concept of uneven precipitation and uncertain stream inflow based on scenario analysis. Within a river basin, the regional authority and subarea managers both have water allocation and reallocation privileges. Motivated by sustainable development of water resource management systems, we argue that regional authorities should focus on alleviating the contradiction between supply and demand, and then seeking an optimum allocation strategy to ensure societal and economic benefits for its subareas, from which the subareas cart provide reasonable reaction strategies. Authorities dominate water transactions between subareas involved in water rights distribution. This paper proposes a multi-objective multistage Stackelberg-Nash-Cournot (m(2)SNC) game model to cope with conflicts between regional authorities and subarea managers concerning multiple activities. An interactive-dynamic-programming-based genetic algorithm (IDP-GA) is designed to simulate the policies needed for the optimum allocation of water resources under various climate scenarios. The significant stress caused by unsustainable water resource allocation has been a perplexing problem for Sancha Lake, an important area in the southeast basin of the Dujiangyan Irrigation System in China. To identify the tradeoffs among stakeholders, we apply the proposed model to this basin. To gain further insight into climate change and water usage sustainability, we simulate the varying spatial and seasonal distribution of stream inflow based on historical climate data and propose different water management strategies for normal, slight drought, moderate drought, and serious drought conditions. This creates an emergency response cooperative mechanism based on different climate scenarios for developing countries that need to cope with water deficiency and uncertain situations.

AB Conventional methods for designing infrastructure that is subject to flood risk, such as dams and levees, assume a stationary design flood. However, observed and potential non-stationarity in floods can result in costly over design or dangerous under-design. Despite substantial attention, evidence from the literature makes clear there is no consensus methodology for estimating design variables under climate change. Practical guidance remains elusive. This paper presents a review of the challenges and advances in design of infrastructure for floods under non-stationarity. First, potential sources of non-stationarity in time series of floods are described to provide context and motivation. Second, methods for estimating design floods that rely on the stationary assumption are presented and their limitations are discussed. Third, methods for estimating design floods that assume non-stationarity resulting from climate change are summarized. Finally, the inadequacies of current design methodologies in view of the pervasive uncertainties are assessed and strategies to manage the consequences of those uncertainties are presented.

AB Mathematical models with small numbers of parameters are useful for hydrological analyses and water resources planning as they are easier to prepare, use, and interpret compared to more complex models. Many simple model structures and simulation strategies have been developed, but there is still substantial room for improvement in the efficiency of daily rainfall-runoff modeling. This study proposes daily rainfall-runoff models that require only two to four parameters yet are capable of predicting peak discharge and baseflow. Parsimonious model structures were obtained using the hyperbolic tangent function and combining it with one subsurface layer and two parameters of a Tank model. The daily rainfall-runoff models proposed based on the Two-Parameter Hyperbolic Model (TPHM) and Tank model were applied to 41 watersheds throughout South Korea. Model accuracy was evaluated by comparing observed and simulated watershed streamflow and compared with that of a nine parameter Tank model. The original TPHM and its variants yielded slightly better efficiency with a smaller number of parameters than the Tank model when reproducing high flows on a daily basis. The accuracy of low flow and flow duration curve predictions provided by the TPHM-based models was higher in watersheds with relatively large baseflow temporal variability. The results suggested that the TPHM-based structures be alternative parsimonious daily rainfall-runoff simulation models. This study demonstrates that daily high streamflow can be efficiently simulated using a two-parameter hydrological model, and daily baseflow simulation can be improved by adding two additional parameters to the model.

AB Developing an understanding of how groundwater (GW) and surface water (SW) systems function and interact to impact water quantity, water quality, and ecosystem health provides a basis for management of water resources, environmental protection, and land management. Although knowledge of these complex and dynamic systems has improved in recent decades, there is currently no systematic guidance for conceptualizing and evaluating GW-SW interactions and identifying their potential impact on management issues. For this reason, a holistic framework was created to provide a comprehensive and logical approach for identifying, understanding, and evaluating the key factors and processes controlling GW-SW interactions and understanding their relationship to environmental problems. The framework identifies fundamental hydrological, biogeochemical, and biological processes and critical factors to consider when developing robust conceptual models of GW-SW systems. The framework is comprehensive and can be adapted to different problems using only the aspects necessary to address a specific issue. The framework focuses on streams, rivers, and lakes but can be adapted for use in other GW-SW settings such as ponds, wetlands, and coastal marine environments. Applicability of the framework is illustrated through evaluation of three GW-SW interaction settings in southern Ontario, Canada: a groundwater contaminant plume discharging to the Pine River, discharge of groundwater nutrients to Lake Huron, and a regional-scale conceptualization of GW-SW flow interactions in the Duffins Creek watershed. The case studies highlight flexibility of the framework to develop conceptual models, assess environmental issues, identify knowledge gaps, and provide a basis for designing site investigations.

AB The finding of important explanatory variables for the location and scale parameters of the generalized extreme value (GEV) distribution, when the latter is used for the modelling of annual streamflow maxima, is known to have reduced the uncertainties in inferences, as estimated through regional flood frequency analysis frameworks. However, important explanatory variables have not been found for the GEV shape parameter, despite its critical significance, which stems from the fact that it determines the behaviour of the upper tail of the distribution. Here we examine the nature of the shape parameter by revealing its relationships with basin attributes. We use a dataset that comprises information about daily streamflow and forcing, climatic indices, topographic, land cover, soil and geological characteristics of 591 basins with minimal human influence in the contiguous United States. We propose a framework that uses random forests and linear models to find (a) important predictor variables of the shape parameter and (b) an interpretable model with high predictive performance. The process of study comprises of assessing the predictive performance of the models, selecting a parsimonious predicting model and interpreting the results in an ad-hoc manner. The findings suggest that the median of the shape parameter is 0.19, the shape parameter mostly depends on climatic indices, while the selected prediction model is a linear one and results in more than 20% higher accuracy in terms of RMSE compared to a naive approach. The implications are important, since it is shown that incorporating the regression model into regional flood frequency analysis frameworks can considerably reduce the predictive uncertainties.

AB Polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR), as an advanced active sensor, can penetrate vegetation to detect ground information. The multimode observation data can provide more information to interpret different scattering mechanisms and have great application potential in soil moisture estimation (SME). In this paper, a modified method of soil moisture inversion from PoISAR data based on a two-component polarimetric decomposition model is introduced. The proposed method neglects the dihedral scattering component in the case of sparse vegetation cover and no-building areas, compensates the orientation angle by considering the influence of surface roughness and terrain slope, and calculates the dielectric constant with the hybrid X-Bragg/Fresnel model. Gaofen-3 (C-band) data from Ordos, Inner Mongolia, and Soil Moisture Experiment 2003 (SMEX03) airborne synthetic aperture radar (AIRSAR) (C- and L-band) data from Southern Oklahoma were applied in the experimental research. Furthermore, the performance and validity limits were assessed by comparing the retrieval results with in situ measurements and Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) soil moisture products. The results reveal a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 8.66% with an inversion rate of up to 61% when using the Gaofen-3 data from Ordos. For the Southern Oklahoma study area, the inversion RMSE of the AIRSAR C- and L-band data is 8.57% and 8.95%, respectively. The tendency of the inversion results is also consistent with the change trend of the site observations. In the bare soil and sparse vegetation covered areas, the retrieval error is relatively small, while in dense vegetation covered areas, soil moisture is underestimated in both the C- and L-band data, and the former is more underestimated than the latter.

AB Flood is a major natural hazard with extremely large impact on social-ecological systems. Therefore, developing reliable and efficient tools to identify areas vulnerable to potential flooding is vital for water managers, engineers and decision makers. Moreover, being able to accurately classify the level of hazard is a step forward towards more efficient flood hazard mapping. This study presents a multi-criteria index approach to classify potential flood hazards at the river basin scale. The presented methodology was implemented in the Mashhad Plain basin in North-east Iran, where flood has been a major issue in the last few decades. In the present study, seven factors, selected based on their greater influence towards flooding, were identified and extracted from the basic thematic layers to be used to generate a five-class Flood Hazard Index (FHI) map. The Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) was used to develop a runoff coefficient map, which was found to be the most influential factor. A sensitivity analysis was performed and the results incorporated to generate a modified Flood Hazard Index (mFHI) map. The accuracy of the proposed method was evaluated against the well-documented flood records in the last 42 years at the study area. The results showed that, for both FHI and mFHI maps, more than 97% of historical flood events have occurred in moderate to very high flood hazard areas. This demonstrates that incorporating hydrological model (such as SWAT) and multi-criteria analysis introduces a robust methodology to generate comprehensive potential flood hazard maps. Moreover, the proposed modified methodology can be used to identify high potential flood hazard zones and work towards more efficient flood management and mitigation strategies.

DE Surface precipitation estimation; Radar-gauge combination; Rainfall
   displacement
ID WIND-DRIFT; EXTERNAL DRIFT; FIELDS
AB Rain gauges are the foundation in hydrology to collect rainfall data, however gauge observations alone are limited at representing the complete rainfall distribution. On the other hand, weather radar can provide a nearly complete spatial distribution of rainfall qualitatively at high temporal and spatial resolution, yet concerns about the biases in the precipitation estimates hamper the direct use of radar data in hydrological applications. Thus the focus of this study is to derive a scheme to merge radar precipitation estimates and the contemporaneous point-wise rain gauge observations. It is common practice to construct radar-gauge pairs by assuming the vertical and instant falling of the hydrometeors from aloft onto the ground. On many occasions, the assumption is invalid, as it ignores a significant fact that the hydrometeors are very likely to be laterally advected in the air by the wind while descending, especially from a large height and/or with the existence of snow. The laterally displacement of rainfall will result in a great discrepancy of radar and gauge data. Concerning these issues, a method to quantify the displacement of rainfall is proposed and the results of the quantification are integrated into much improved surface precipitation estimates.

AB Fluid flow architecture in fractured reservoirs is mainly based on the dual porosity model. In this model, the matrix block is considered as a fluid storage source and fracture as a flow path. Nevertheless, in naturally fractured reservoirs, different properties of matrix blocks and fracture systems have caused the triple porosity model to be more applicable than the traditional dual porosity model.
   The existed triple porosity models presented so far are mainly based on pseudo steady state flow in the matrix block and vug and via a semi-analytic form. In this paper, two analytical models of triple porosity model are presented with consideration of transient flow; the first model being: the series flow of the matrix block to the vug and the vug to the fracture, and the second model: transient parallel flow of the matrix block and vug to the fracture. In this paper, for the first time, an analytical and transient shape factor between different regions is put forward.
   Using the developed new solution, various flow regimes in triple porosity model have been identified. In the series triple porosity model, changing the parameters of vug and matrix did not affect the early production while it influenced the rate of the middle and lately times. The shape factor between the matrix and vug was independent of the physical properties of vug while the shape factor between vug and fracture was influenced by the physical properties of vug and matrix. In the parallel triple porosity model, the shape factor of matrix-fracture and vug-fracture were not dependent on the properties of the other regions of rock. Moreover, a decrease in inter-porosity coefficient and an increase in storativity ratio increased the shape factor in transient time.
   Additionally, in order to validate the analytical model, the results of the model are compared with the numerical simulations. This study presents a new analytical and transient shape factor which finds application in simulation of triple porosity formations.

AB Information on extreme precipitation is essential to managing weather-related risks and designing hydraulic structures. Research attention to frequency analyses based on remotely sensed precipitation datasets, such as those obtained from weather radars and satellites, has been rapidly increasing owing to their potential to provide information for ungauged regions worldwide. Together with the ability to measure the areal scale directly, these analyses promise to overcome the sampling limitations of traditional methods based on rain gauges. This focused review of the literature depicts the state of the art after a decade of efforts, and identifies the crucial gaps in knowledge and methodology that currently hinder the quantitative use of remotely sensed datasets in water resources system design and operation. It concludes by highlighting a set of research directions promising immediate impact with regard to the separation of the sources of uncertainty currently affecting applications based on remotely sensed datasets, the development of statistical methods that can cope with the peculiar characteristics of these datasets, and the improvement of validation methods. Important gains in knowledge are expected from the explicit inclusion of the areal dimension in the analyses and from the fine-scale investigation of extreme precipitation climatology.

AB Knowledge of vegetative responses to drought across hydroclimatic zones is crucial for understanding ecohydrologic cycles. Based on monthly self-calibrated Palmer drought severity index (PDSI), standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index (SPEI) at different time scales (1-48 month scales), and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), this study examined the relationship between natural vegetation dynamics and drought in the growing season during 1982-2012 at 293 sites over China. Pearson correlations between NDVI and drought indices (PDSI and SPED were employed to quantify the association between vegetation and drought. The results show that the Pearson correlations between PDSI and NDVI in growing season (C-NP) ranged from -0.47 to 0.84, and the maximum correlation between SPEI and NDVI in growing season (MaxSPEI) ranged from -0.31 to 0.86, within which the negative correlations were mainly observed in the areas dominated by forest in south China. Moreover, the C-NP was highly and nonlinearly related to the aridity index (empty set) (MaxSPEI showed a similar trend). The relationship between C-NP and empty set indicated that, water stress was not the limiting factor for natural vegetation in humid regions (empty set < 0.98) even during droughts; the drought vulnerability of natural vegetation increased with increasing empty set up to a point (empty set = 4.68) and then decreased with increasing empty set when empty set > 4.68; in extreme arid regions, the natural vegetation exhibited less sensitivity to drought. These tendencies could be seen worldwide. The varied physiological properties of plants and the response of photosynthesis to energy processes probably explain some discernible variation.

AB A fully-saturated lens of steady fresh groundwater floating in a homogeneous and isotropic desert sandy aquifer is analytically studied based on a hydrological model by Kunin and interface solution by Van Der Veer. A static saline groundwater is beneath the lens. A phreatic surface of moving fresh water inside the lens is partially recharged (either naturally or by managed aquifer recharge) from the vadose zone and partially exfiltrates to it. A spatially focused recharge and intensive evapotranspiration preserve a steady downward-upward topology of fresh water motion. In terms of the 1-D Dupuit-Forchheimer approximation in a horizontal in-lens saturated flow a boundary value problem (BVP) for an ODE for the Strack potential is solved. The shape of the water table and, based on the Ghijben-Herzberg assumption, the interface are found. The total volume of the positive-pore pressure water flowing within the lens is evaluated. Constant infiltration and evaporation rates as well as evaporation linearly decreasing with depth of the water table (counted from the ground surface) are considered. The case of 2-D flow is tackled by the Toth model. A triangular analytic element approximates a half of the flow domain and consists of an isobaric side and two no-flow sides. Conformal mapping of this triangle onto a reference plane and solution of the Dirichlet BVP in a half-plane deliver the distribution of infiltration-exfiltration intensity along the water table, total flow rate and locus of the hinge point. A mathematically more cumbersome approximation of the flow domain assumes the water table to be a tilted straight line but the interface to be found as a free boundary. Solution of the corresponding BVP uses a curvilinear triangle in the hodograph plane.

TI Groundwater DRASTIC vulnerability mapping by unsupervised and supervised

AB Production of defensible modelling tools for aquifer vulnerability mapping under the conditions of sparse data remains topical using the DRASTIC framework. DRASTIC is the acronym for seven data layers using a prescribed scoring system in terms of rates to account for local variations and weights to account for the relative importance of data layers. Also, the term framework signifies the consensual nature of choosing the data layers without any theoretical or empirical basis. Artificial Intelligence (AI) or similar techniques are used to reduce inherent subjectivities through a strategy of unsupervised learning from data by formulating Multiple Frameworks (MF) and supervised learning from Multiple Models (MMs) without searching for any 'superior' model. Notably, a framework lacks the procedure for iterative training and testing, as usual in modelling procedures. In this strategy, models are organised in two hierarchical levels: Level I comprises the construction of MFs (two frameworks) and/or MMs (two models); Level 2 comprises a model or an algorithm to reuse the outputs from Level 1 through formulating four strategies, including a mixture of MFs/MMs, in which Support Vector Machine (SVM) is chosen by the paper to run models at Level 2. The supervision process uses target values as a function of observed nitrate-N values. The strategy is applied to the aquifer in the Malekan region, where the past extensive agricultural practices have been transformed into intensive use of fertilisers without protecting water quality in the aquifers. Results show that AIMM/MF lead to significant improvements in delineating high vulnerability areas.

AB Glacier-wide mass balances and runoffs are reconstructed over 1969-2016 for Chhota Shigri Glacier catchment (India) applying a glacio-hydrological model. The model is forced using in-situ daily air-temperature and precipitation records from the meteorological stations at Bhuntar Observatory (1092 m a.s.l.), glacier base camp (3850 m a.s.l.) and glacier side moraine (4863 m a.s.l.). The modelled mean annual mass balance is -0.30 +/- 0.36m w.e.a(-1) (meter water equivalent per year), while the mean catchment-wide runoff is 1.56 +/- 0.23 m w.e.a(-1) over 1969-2016. Three periods are distinguished in the reconstructed mass balance and runoff series. Periods I (1969-1985) and III (2001-2016) show glacier mass wastage at rates of -0.36 and - 0.50 m w.e.a(-1), respectively, corresponding to catchment-wide runoffs of 1.51 and 1.65 m w.e.a(-1), respectively. Conversely, period II (1986-2000) exhibits steady-state conditions with average mass balances of -0.01 m w.e.a(-1), and corresponding runoff of 1.52m w.e.a(-1). The reduced ice melt (0.20m w.e.a(-1)) over period II, in agreement with steady-state conditions, is compensated by the increased snow melt (1.03 m w.e.a(-1)), providing almost similar catchment-wide runoffs for period I and II. The increased runoff after 2000 is mainly governed by increased ice melt (0.32m w.e.a(-1)) over period III. Snow accumulation in winter and summer seasons together control the glacier-wide mass balances as well as catchment-wide runoffs. Snow melt contributes the maximum to the total mean annual runoff with 63% share while glacier melt and rain contribute 17% and 20% respectively over the whole period.

   Heterogeneous reservoir
ID ANALYZING LINEAR FLOW; HORIZONTAL WELLS; PRESSURE; FLUID; CONDUCTIVITY;
   PERMEABILITY
AB The significance of unconventional low-permeability reservoir development has been well recognized in recent years. Pressure- and rate-transient behavior analyses are crucial methods of finding key factors that affect well production in these formations. However, previous analytically or semi-analytically based gridless models of pressure- and rate-transient response analyses for multi-stage fractured horizontal wells (MFHWs) mainly deal with homogeneous reservoirs and merely use skin factors to describe the fracture damage. Fracture damage normally refers to the conductivity reduction within hydraulic fractures and the matrix permeability or porosity impairment near the fracture face. The widely applied skin factors are derived under steady-state conditions and are accurate only when the damage length is small. They also show inability to simulate partially propped fractures and multiple fracture damage scenarios.
   In this article, a general linear flow model is established to simulate heterogeneous box-shaped unconventional low-permeability reservoirs with closed outer boundaries and various hydraulic fracture damage, including (1) fracture near-wellbore damage caused by proppant flow-back, over-displacement, embedment, crush or ineffective placement, (2) partially propped fractures with undamaged near-wellbore regions, (3) fracturing fluid leak-off damage in the adjacent matrix, (4) dual or multiple damage effects under unsteady-flow conditions. The fracture interference in heterogeneous reservoirs is modeled by our previous method (Zeng et al., 2018).
   The basic model has been verified against well-testing software KAPPA, and satisfactory agreements are obtained. New type curves have been generated with distinct flow regimes for specific fracture damage mechanisms. Sensitivity analyses have been conducted to find out how the damage properties affect the shape and duration of these distinct regimes. Reservoir heterogeneity combined with fracture damage makes the pressure and rate behavior deviate significantly from the undamaged homogeneous one and controls the fracture flux distribution in certain regimes during production for both constant-rate and constant-pressure production cases. In addition, field data from the Cardium unconventional light oil formation in western Canada are analyzed through type curve matching, which demonstrates the benefits of our model. The findings of this model are potentially helpful for field data analyses and fracture damage diagnostic.

AB Several studies have documented the characteristics of seasonal, decadal, and spatial variations of tritium in different regions including North America, Australia, and Europe. However, long-term data such as these studies were not yet reported for Northeast Asia. In this study, we document the extensive spatial-temporal monitoring data of tritium levels in precipitation measured at 16 stations in Korea over the last 20 years, including the long-term trend since 1961 by using measured and estimated data. The long-term variation of tritium concentrations in the Korean precipitation follows the global trend, reaching the maximum in 1963 owing to nuclear bomb testing, followed by a consistent level since the late 1990s. Tritium concentrations in precipitation from 1998 to 2017 were maximum in spring (April) due to tropopause folding and minimum in summer (July) due to the dominant inflows of marine air. The tritium concentrations in precipitation were lower toward the coastal stations, due to the influence of marine moisture for all seasons. Our results characterize the differences in tritium levels in groundwater recharging areas for different periods in this region. These results will serve as important tritium reference data for hydrology studies in Northeast Asia, which is an important region for understanding global hydrological cycles.

AB Statistical post-processing methods have been applied in hydrometeorological forecasting to correct the bias and spread error in raw forecasts. Among various post-processing methods, the meta-Gaussian distribution model (MGD) is one of the early successful methods for post-processing of precipitation forecasts and has been applied in the National Weather Service's Hydrologic Ensemble Forecast System (HEFS), together with the mix-type meta-Gaussian distribution model (MMGD). However, recent studies have shown that the original MGD cannot yield reliable forecasts especially for sub-daily precipitation forecasts (e.g., 6-hourly). In this paper, we improved the MGD model by applying the censored maximum likelihood estimation (CMLE) method. We conducted experiments using GEFS reforecasts in Huai river basin in China to evaluate its performance. The results show that the proposed method performs better than the original MGD for sub-daily precipitation forecasts. The proposed method also achieves similar forecast skill with the state-of-the-art censored, shifted Gamma distribution-based ensemble MOS (CSGD-EMOS) if both use ensemble mean as the only predictor. The results indicate that the proposed CMLE-MGD can be useful for further applications such as flood forecasting that needs forecasts of high temporal resolution.

AB Human activities have altered terrestrial carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) dynamics via changes to land cover and use such as deforestation, agriculture, application of fertilizers, etc. and have influenced the patterns of organic C input and eutrophication in downstream freshwater ecosystems. Biogeochemical cycling of C and N and the related organic carbon (OC) production may display correlated diurnal and seasonal variations due to photosynthesis and respiration in these ecosystems, whose underlying mechanisms still need to be resolved. In this study, we document the diurnal and seasonal variations measured in DIC (dissolved inorganic carbon), NO3-, TOC (total organic carbon) and other related hydrochemical parameters (pH and DO-dissolved oxygen) in five artificial spring-pond ecosystems with differing land-uses in tanks draining into springs and corresponding ponds, constructed at the Shawan Karst Test Site, SW China. It was found that diurnal changes in DIC, NO3- and TOC in all ponds were dominated by aquatic ecosystem metabolism (i.e., photosynthesis and respiration), as evidenced by the pertinent variations in DO and pH. Daily DIC and NO3- uptake and OC production were higher in October (growing period) and lower in January (dormant period), indicating seasonal differences in assimilation that were determined by both changes in weather (temperature and light) and nutrient inputs. Under conditions of bare rock or bare soil, there was very low DIC and NO3- additions to the spring-pond ecosystems, resulting in lower OC productivity in the ponds. Cropped land yielded higher DIC and NO3- to the pond, due to growth of corn and use of fertilizers that enhanced OC production. Highest productivity and densest vegetation cover on tanks with grassland or shrubs (with higher N retention in soils) resulted in higher DIC but limited NO3- addition to the ecosystems downstream. The highest DIC concentration (in the grassland) resulted in maximum OC production in the pond. These results indicate that OC production in the ponds with elevated pH was limited by DIC fertilization. In general, the supply of DIC is not considered to limit aquatic primary productivity because its concentration exceeds that of other plant macronutrients such as NO3 and PO43- by two or three orders of magnitude. Therefore, the carbon limitation detected here may indicate that photoautotrophs in karst dominated aquatic terrains (dominated by Charophyta and Spirogyra) cannot use the total DIC for photosynthesis but only the dissolved CO2, which comprises < 1% of total DIC at pH > 8.2 that is characteristic in these environments. This may have implications for control of eutrophication in such alkaline aquatic ecosystems, i.e., rates of eutrophication in freshwater ecosystems may be regulated not only by N and/or P but also by C. It is also projected that there will be an increase in OC sequestration with the current land-use and global climate change-driven increases in DIC, due to carbon limitation of aquatic primary production.

AB Coal remains the largest contributor to China's energy structure. However, coal production has frequently been threatened by groundwater inrush incidents induced by fault zones. The variations in the hydraulic properties of fault zones under high water pressure in relation to groundwater inrush risk are poorly understood. This paper presents high-pressure fluid injection tests used to investigate the variations in hydraulic properties of a fault zone at depth. The analysis of experimental results shows that the injection rate and hydraulic conductivity increase as nonlinear functions of injection pressure. The evolution process induced by high water pressure can be divided into three flow phases, including a Darcy flow phase, a flow transition phase and an unstable flow phase. Two thresholds of injection pressure for the onset of nonlinear flow and the onset of substantial fracture dilation and hydraulic fracturing were identified. The hydraulic conductivity of the fault zone is closely related to the water pressure, with an evident increase in permeability resulting from fracture extension and enhancement of fracture connectivity, which were attributed to water injection. Finally, a conceptual model was developed to demonstrate the textural and hydraulic evolution of the fault zone.

AB Changes in terrestrial water storage anomalies (TWSA) are not only influenced by local climate conditions but also by teleconnection factors. To date, how teleconnection factors including sunspot activities could affect TWSA has been under-examined. In this study, we investigate the TWSA dynamics in the Yunnan Province (YP), China, and assess their relationships with teleconnection factors at multiple timescales. Results show that: (1) GRACE data is able to reflect TWSA dynamics in the study region, as demonstrated by its high correlations with soil moisture, precipitation, and groundwater anomalies; (2) GRACE-based TWSA shows a downward trend of varying degrees at the monthly, seasonal, annual and multi-year scales, with obvious periodic changes of 11 and around 60 months; (3) precipitation magnitude and its distribution characteristics in humid areas are the main driving factors of TWSA, and teleconnection factors have stronger association with precipitation-concentration degree (PCD) than precipitation magnitude; (4) the 2009 extreme drought has caused a sharp decrease in TWSA, and the correlations between TWSA with Arctic Oscillation (AO) and El-Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) were 0.88 (a = 0.01) and -0.58 (a = 0.01). This study sheds new insights into how teleconnection factors could TWSA dynamics in a changing environment.

ID CATCHMENTS; TIME
AB Decreased funding and shifting governmental priorities have resulted in a contraction of hydrometric measurement in many regions over the past two decades. Moreover, concerns exist with respect to appropriate data usage and (transboundary) exchange, in addition to the compatibility and extent of existing hydrometric datasets. These issues are undoubtedly magnified due to enhanced data demands and increased financial pressures on network managers, thus requiring new approaches to optimising the societal benefits and overall efficacy of hydrometric information for future socio-hydrological resilience.
   The current study employed a quantitative cross-sectional expert elicitation of 203 respondents to collate, analyse and assess hydrometric network users' opinions, knowledge and experience. Current usage patterns, perceived network strengths, requirements, and limitations have been identified and discussed within the context of hydrometric resilience in a changing social, economic and natural environment. Findings indicate that small (<30 km(2)) catchment data are most frequently employed in the Republic of Ireland, particularly with respect to extreme event prediction and flood management. Similarly, small catchments and areas characterised by previous/recent flooding were prioritised for resilience management via network amendment. Over half of those surveyed (50.5%) reported the current network as inadequate for their professional requirements. Conversely, respondents indicated network efficacy has improved (53.2%) or remained stable (26.6%) over the course of their professional career, however, improvements (as defined by individual respondents i.e. network density, data quality, data availability) have not occurred at a sufficient rate. User-defined efficacy (adequacy, resilience) was found to be a somewhat vague, multivariate concept, with no individual predictor identified, however, general data quality, network density, and urban catchment data were the most significant issues among respondents. A significant majority (85.4%) of respondents indicate that future resilience would be best achieved via network density amendment, with over 60% favouring geographically and/or categorically focused network increases, as opposed to more general national increases.

AB Litter and vegetation under forest canopy (i.e., understory vegetation) are known to reduce soil erosion and contribute substantially to evapotranspiration. However, previous studies rarely examined understory water interception. We conducted a comprehensive study of rainfall partitioning using a water balance equation that included both overstory and understory components in a Chinese fir (Cunninghamia lanceolata) plantation and a nearby naturally regenerated Castanopsis (C. carlesii) forest of similar age in southeastern China. Understory interception was measured by submerging understory components (vegetation and litter) in water for 24 h, which gave an estimate of the amount of water retained (i.e., water holding capacity). The total interception loss of rainfall events (> 9.8 mm) that generated surface runoff converged between the two forests, a result of a smaller overstory interception loss (20%) coupled with a greater understory interception loss (14%) in the Chinese fir plantation relative to the Castanopsis forest (overstory 25% and understory 11%). The convergence of the total interception contributed to the convergence of the surface runoff, 1% of the rainfall in both forests. Furthermore, the throughfall partition (78%) was greater whereas the stemflow partition (2%) was smaller in the Chinese fir plantation relative to the Castanopsis forest (throughfall 70% and stemflow 5%). These patterns in rainfall partitioning could be explained by the greater development of the understory vegetation (hence greater understory interception loss) in the Chinese fir plantation, lower canopy leaf area index (hence smaller overstory interception loss and greater throughfall), and rougher barks (hence smaller stemflow) of Chinese fir trees compared to that of Castanopsis trees. Our study illustrated that a comprehensive evaluation of interception loss must take into account understory components.

AB Climate change and human activities are two important factors affecting surface runoff. In water resource planning and management, it is usually important to separate the contribution of the mentioned factors to the runoff change. In this paper, a new methodology is proposed to obtain the relative impact of human activities and climate change on streamflow under uncertainty. In this methodology, the breakpoint of the annual time series of the observed runoff is estimated and the time series is divided into two study periods; before and after the breakpoint, namely the "natural" and "impacted" periods. The Jazim monthly water balance model is used for monthly runoff simulation. To incorporate the effect of snow in simulating runoff, two Jazim-based monthly water balance models with Rao and Al Wagdany (1995) and McCabe and Markstrom (2007) snow modules are used. Then, the monthly water balance models are calibrated and verified for the natural and impacted periods. The main parameters of the water balance models are optimized using the Genetic Algorithms. The uncertainty of the parameters of the models is analyzed using differential evolution adaptive Metropolis (DREAM) algorithm, which is based on the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm. This algorithm provides the posterior probability distribution functions (PDFs) of parameters of the runoff simulation models. Next, the PDFs of the contribution rate (CR) of the climate change and human activities to runoff are determined using the fixing changing method by taking into account the PDFs of the models' parameters. To show the applicability and efficiency of the proposed methodology, it is applied to the Zayandehrud sub-basin in Iran. Using the Standard Normal Homogeneity Test (SNHT), Pettitt and Buishand range tests, one breakpoint at 2006 is detected in runoff time series. Through the monthly rainfall-runoff simulations and the fixing-changing method, it is estimated that decrease in the runoff after the breakpoint can be attributed to climate change by 57.8% and 45%, using the Jazim-Rao & Al Wagdany model and the Jazim-McCabe & Markstrom model, respectively. The results of the uncertainty analysis of the parameters of the water balance models show that the parameters of LSMX (maximum moisture capacity of the lower soil layer) and K-3 (deep percolation coefficient) are the most significant parameters in the uncertainty of runoff simulated by both the models. According to the PDFs of contribution rate (CR) of climate change and human activities which are obtained using each rainfall-runoff model, it can be inferred that the Jazim-McCabe & Markstrom model significantly decreased the uncertainty of estimations.

AB Little measurement-based soil moisture information is available for the humid to semi-humid transitional zones in China. Anhui Province is a representative area of these zones and spans several hydroclimatic and geomorphological zones. To overcome shortage of observational soil moisture information in this area, we collected and compiled a multi-layer daily soil moisture record from 2012 to 2016 across Anhui Province based on the observations of a soil moisture-observing network composed of 85 sites. We then analyzed the vertical and spatiotemporal variability of soil moisture across this region. Primary findings are: (a) soil moisture in this region has apparent vertical gradients and increases with soil depth; (b) substantial soil moisture spatial variability appears in the shallow soil layers (depth <= 40 cm) with the highest values in the middle part of this region, but soil moisture in the deep layers (depth > 40 cm) shows low spatial variability; (c) seasonality of soil moisture across this region is complicated and has fluctuations with July as the wettest month in most of the province; (d) inter-monthly fluctuation of soil moisture is larger in the upper soil layers than in the lower layers; and (e) antecedent accumulated rainfall is a major factor influencing soil moisture throughout this region with soil moisture in the upper layers more sensitive to immediate weather conditions and soil moisture in the lower layers showing lagged responses to the weather conditions. This study can not only reveal the spatiotemporal and vertical characteristics of soil moisture across this region, but also provide a useful reference dataset for the other soil moisture modeling and retrieval studies.

AB Effective management of nonpoint source (NPS) pollutants requires an understanding of their potential surface runoff and baseflow pathways. In this study, an integrated method was developed for separating baseflow and surface NPS pollutants at the watershed scale. Then, the uncertainty of the prediction of baseflow NPS pollutants was explored by comparing four hydrographic separation methods (the United Kingdom Institute of Hydrology (UKIH), the Lyne-Hollick (LH) method, the Eckhardt (ECK) method and the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT)), three data sources (monitoring data, SWAT and the LOADEST model) and two baseflow period assumptions. A real case study was performed in a typical catchment, the Three Gorges Reservoir Area, China. The results showed that the baseflow annually contributed 30.1% and 23.0% of the total nitrogen (TN) and phosphorus (TP) load, respectively, indicating that baseflow was identified as the key means of transport of NPS pollutants, especially for NPS-N during the dry season. The water quality data source represents the largest uncertainty source in baseflow NPS pollutant estimation, and the simulated baseflow loads of TN and TP were the largest when LOADEST and SWAT were used as water quality data sources, respectively. The baseflow NPS estimations were more uncertain for TN during the non-dry season and TP during the dry season. The results of this study could provide implications for the prediction and management of NPS pollutants at the watershed scale, especially for groundwater-polluted catchments.

AB Climate change and human activities have induced alterations to hydrological processes. The quantification of their impacts on streamflow is a challenge, especially at the seasonal scale due to seasonality of climate variables and human activities. In this study, the decomposition method based on Budyko equation is extended to the seasonal scale for quantifying the climate and direct human impacts on annual and seasonal streamflow changes in Huifa River basin by defining prechange period (1953-1974) and postchange period (1975-2005). The results are further verified by the monthly abcd model. Both climate change and direct human activities are found to induce a decrease in streamflow at the annual scale, with 68% of the change contributed by direct human activities. At the seasonal scale, the direct human-induced declines in streamflow account for 67% and 39% of the total changes for energy-limited and water-limited seasons, respectively; whereas, the impact of direct human activities is more pronounced during the irrigation season due to water withdrawal for irrigation. In addition, the decomposition results are analyzed for each month in the energy-limited season to reveal the effects of precipitation and operation rules of ponds and reservoirs during the flood season.

AB Precipitation data plays an important role in investigation of water-related fields of research such as water resources management, hydraulic structure design and groundwater quantity/quality parameters due to its high variability in space and time. To evaluate and investigate precipitation pattern, a set of well-designed rain gauge stations can substantially reduce the cost and increase the estimation accuracy. In the present research, a new methodology of spatiotemporal optimization is developed for a rain gauge monitoring network and the results are compared to the optimized network based on spatial variations of precipitation. The optimization process consists of two main steps of application of multi attribute decision making and heuristic approaches. The entropy is chosen as the multi attribute decision making approach to determine optimum number of stations. Then, the optimization process is implemented via coupling of Genetic Algorithm (GA) and geostatistical methods to identify the best rain gauge network configuration. To determine the spatiotemporal structure of precipitation, spatiotemporal variography and geostatistical methods known as Ordinary Kriging (OK) and Bayesian Maximum Entropy (BME) have been undertaken. Thirty years of annual precipitation data from 105 rain gauge stations within and near Namak Lake watershed in the central part of Iran are utilized in this research to optimize rain gauge stations spatially and temporally. Results showed that spatiotemporal network design considerably differs from spatial optimal rain gauge stations. Optimal locations of rain gauge stations resulted from spatiotemporal approach are almost two times better than spatial configuration to reduce rain gauge costs (installation, operation, maintenance, etc.) by avoiding data redundancy more efficiently. In addition, BMEbased network design method outperformed OK-based network.

AB Vernal pools are seasonal wetlands that have a high diversity of endemic and native plant species, yet they are threatened by agricultural conversion and urban development and face threats posed by climate change resulting from altered precipitation and temperature regimes. We developed an approach to investigate the potential impacts of climate change on hydrology and vegetation communities of vernal pools by creating a mass-balance hydrologic model that is coupled to a statistical model of plant community distribution. The hydrologic and vegetative models were calibrated using field measurements from a vernal pool in northeastern California that experiences snow-dominated hydrology and is larger than vernal pools in more studied areas like Central California, but representative of other northern California vernal pools. Using downscaled data from global climate models, the coupled model suggests that warmer conditions will lead to the pool being inundated for a shorter time, but with little change in maximum depth. Reduced hydroperiods suggest possible declines in vernal pool specialist species with future climate change. The coupled model is an integrated approach for understanding the impact of altered environmental conditions on unique hydrology and plant community composition of vernal pool ecosystems, but the model approach could be improved with longer term data and by applying it at more sites to broaden the applicability of the approach and to enable better process representation.

DE Spring backup; Ice jam; Water level distribution; b-Value
ID LENA RIVER; FLOODS
AB Distributions of daily average water levels prior to ice-jams and in jam-free periods during spring breakups in the Lena river were constructed. The results showed that during periods of water rising in jam-free years, water levels were distributed in a random manner, in accordance with an exponential (Poisson-like) function. In contrast, water-level distributions during periods preceding ice-jams followed a power law similar to various multiscale hydrological phenomena, such as flood occurrences, return periods of rainfall, Arctic drifting-ice dynamics, and other nonequilibrium natural processes. However, the complexity of ice-jam floods is of a particular kind. In many cases, the power exponent in a water-level distribution (referred to as the b-value in a Gutenberg-Richter relation) increased sharply a few days before an ice-jam. In other words, a plot of the entire power-law distribution usually consists of two portions, differing in their slope. In terms of thermodynamics, an increase of the b-value leads to a decrease of the system conservation. To explain this effect, one should take into account that ice-jams are frequently preceded by advances of ice, which changes the energy balance in the water-ice system. As a result, the power exponent in water-level distributions appears to be higher in the partially fragmented ice cover.

ID MEASURING CAMPAIGNS; IDENTIFIABILITY
AB Water quality data in the sewer system are indispensable for modelling, but rarely available, as measurements in sewers are challenging to conduct. Optimal experimental design (OED) is a powerful tool to identify and maximize the information content of measurement data. This paper adopts a model-based OED methodology to efficiently plan a measurement campaign for final model calibration and validation of a new sewer water quality model. To do so, a preliminary calibrated model of the case study is used to evaluate the information content of different potential measurement locations and scenarios for suspended solids as measured variable. The case study first demonstrates how OED can identify the best measurement location within a complex sewer network. It secondly demonstrates that measuring the beginning of a big rain event results in the most information-rich data among all scenarios evaluated. Thirdly, it analyses in detail the information content of dry weather flow (DWF) data. In comparison to previous studies the methodology is improved by considering the actual measurement error characteristics when calculating the information content of measurement data.

AB Accurate estimation of reference evapotranspiration (ET0) is critical for water resource management and irrigation scheduling. This study evaluated the potential of a new machine learning algorithm using gradient boosting on decision trees with categorical features support (i.e., CatBoost) for accurately estimating daily ET0 with limited meteorological data in humid regions of China. Two other commonly used machine learning algorithms, Random Forests (RF) and Support Vector Machine (SVM), were also assessed for comparison. Eight input combinations of daily meteorological data [including both complete and incomplete combinations of solar radiation (R-s), maximum and minimum temperatures (T-max and T-min), relative humidity (H-r) and wind speed (U)] from five weather stations during 2001-2015 in South China were applied for model training and testing. The results showed that all the three algorithms could achieve satisfactory accuracy for ET0 estimation in subtropical China using R-s, T-max and T-min, or U, H-r, T-max, and T-min as inputs, under the circumstances of lacking complete meteorological parameters. The increases in testing RMSE and MAPE over training RMSE and MAPE showed positive correlations with the number of input parameters to the machine learning models. For the local models, among the three algorithms, SVM offered the best prediction accuracy and stability with incomplete combinations of meteorological parameters as inputs, while CatBoost performed best with the complete combination of parameters. Patterns of the generalized models were almost the same as the local models, but the former ones showed less than 10% decreases in RMSE or MAPE in comparison with the latter ones. In addition, the computing time and memory usage for data processing of CatBoost were much less than those of RF and SVM. Overall, as a tree-based algorithm, CatBoost made significant improvements in accuracy, stability and computational cost when compared to RF. Therefore, the CatBoost algorithm has a very high potential for ET0 estimation in humid regions of China, and even possibly in other parts of the world with similar humid climates.

AB To date, many numerical approaches are available in studying water flow and sediment dynamics along rivers from the reach to the watershed scale, based on various simplifications. The aim of the present research is to demonstrate how the so-called "morphodynamic quasi-equilibrium hypothesis" is effective in modelling riverine landscape morphodynamics evolution at the watershed scale, focussing on the long-term changes of longitudinal profile and bed grainsize composition of large alluvial rivers. A lumped 0-D, two-reach, two-grainsize model based on the Local Uniform Flow hypothesis and originally developed for reproducing fluvial changes at the historical time-scale, has been applied to three large watercourses to reproduce their long-term evolution, performing a sensitivity analysis based on the present conditions. Three morphometric parameters were analysed, aiming to describe the evolution of the longitudinal profile (concavity and aggrading) and the grain-size composition of the river bed (fining). Though the 0-D approach does not allow for a spatial distribution of the input parameters, namely the liquid and solid discharge, the modelling outcomes show reasonably good qualitative trends. At the scale of analysis (centuries to millennia) and for the chosen large sedimentary systems (thousands of kilometres long), which show high inertia to geomorphological changes likely owing to their longitudinal scale, the model can be helpful in detecting where the present conditions reflect a big disturbance to the "natural" trend. This initial detection method can provide additional insights in evaluating the capability of actual rivers to respond to the present external forcing, eventually reaching a quasi-stable configuration.

AB Grass swales are important elements of the urban green infrastructure that convey and attenuate urban runoff and improve its quality mostly through stormwater infiltration into, and retention of conveyed pollutants by, swale soils. The retention of metals by grass swales was addressed in this study investigating the enrichment of swale soils by three common traffic-related metals: Cu, Pb and Zn. Three swales of various characteristics (L1, L2, L3) were selected for study and their soils were sampled by coring the top 30 cm and dividing the cores into 5 cm thick layers. Cumulative metal burdens were compared to those modelled by the proprietary StormTac Web model, which estimates annual loads of specific constituents for the given land uses and stormwater treatment. The comparisons of measured (MBm) and simulated (MBs) metal burdens retained by swales showed that the measured values exceed the simulated ones, as described by average ratios MBs/MBm = 0.64, 0.50 and 0.59, for swales L1, L2 and L3, respectively. The measured burdens were calculated after subtracting the native soil metal concentrations, assumed equal to those found in the deepest sampled layer, 25-30 cm below the surface. The results suggest the feasibility of assessing performance of grass swales by modelling metal (Cu, Pb, Zn) retention by swales, however for older facilities considered for rehabilitation, the simulated results should be supplemented by soil chemistry sampling.

TI Factors controlling evolution of karst conduits in sandy limestone and

AB Karst potential is rarely studied in calcareous sandstones and sandy limestones. The minimum content of carbonate necessary for the development of conduits is unknown, and the mechanisms of the origins of conduits in these rocks are poorly understood. This article focuses upon these questions in an important regional aquifer.
   Samples of limestones and sandstones were taken from outcrops in vertical profiles, and were subjected to a rapid dissolution test with 10% HCI. The degree of disintegration of the samples after dissolution of the carbonate was observed in order to estimate which portions of the rock enabled formation of karst conduits. Carbonate content was measured by calcimetry. Distribution of calcite cement and other sources of cohesion were studied by scanning electron microscopy. Tracer tests in the conduits were evaluated.
   Calcite is the dominant carbonate mineral and main cementing agent in the Jizera Fm. Aquifer (mean content 51%). However, calcite content was found to be a weak predictor of karst potential. Most of the samples disintegrated completely if the calcite content exceeded 55%. On the other hand, some rocks with a calcite content up to 70% did not disintegrate due to microcrystalline/amorphous silica, which bound the quartz grains together and/or formed a foam-like supporting structure.
   After in situ calcite dissolution, the rock in karst-prone zones is turned to residuum, which consequently is washed out by fast flow (0.01-0.2 m/s, based on tracer tests). Microscopic study of cementing agents of the siliciclastic-carbonate sediments and dissolution tests are essential for understanding the mechanisms of conduit origin in ghost-rock karst.

AB Wetlands are considered to be the important carbon sequestration functional units, and moisture is a critical environmental factor that affects the mineralization of soil organic carbon (SOC). However, little information is available on the effects of soil moisture on SOC mineralization in floodplain wetlands with different flooding frequencies. Soil samples to a depth of 20 cm were collected in five types of floodplain wetlands with different flooding frequencies (i.e., permanent floodplain F0, 1-year floodplain F1, 5-year floodplain F5, 10-year flood plain F10, and 100-year floodplain F100) in the downstream of the Huolin River basin of China. A 30-day incubation experiment with three moisture treatments (i.e., 30%, 60%, and 100% water holding capacity (WHC)) was used to identify SOC mineralization processes and key influencing factors in these five floodplain wetlands. Our results showed that the topsoils (0-10 cm) contained significantly higher SOC contents than the subsurface soils (10-20 cm). The SOC contents followed the order of F5 > F0 > F1 > F10 > F100 and the order FO > F5 > F100 > F1 > F10 in the topsoils and subsurface soils, respectively, of five floodplain wetlands. The optimum moisture for the SOC mineralization of the topsoils was 30% WHC in F100, and 60% WHC in the other four wetlands. In the case of all the subsurface soils, 30% WHC was the optimum moisture for the SOC mineralization. The mineralization processes of SOC (especially the active carbon pool) could be better fitted by first-order kinetic models (R-2 > 0.98). The topsoils basically showed a lower C-0/SOC ratio (C-0: the potentially mineralized carbon) than the subsurface soils, except in the case of 60% and 100% WHC in F0 and F5. Under higher soil moisture conditions, the mineralization parameter k was significantly correlated with soil conductivity (p < 0.05). Under low soil moisture condition, C-0/SOC showed significant correlations with soil pH (p < 0.01). Our findings indicate that the change in the soil moisture of floodplain wetlands with different flooding frequencies could greatly affect the carbon pool of inland wetlands.

AB The SMAPVEX12 (Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) Validation Experiment 2012) experiment was conducted during June-July 2012 in Manitoba, Canada with the goal of collecting remote sensing data and ground measurements for the development and testing of soil moisture retrieval algorithms under varying vegetation and soil conditions for the SMAP satellite. The aircraft based soil moisture data provided by the passive/active microwave sensor PALS (Passive and Active L-band System) has a nominal spatial resolution of 1600 m. However, this resolution is not compatible with agricultural, meteorological and hydrological studies that require high spatial resolutions and this issue can be solved by soil moisture disaggregation. The soil moisture disaggregation algorithm integrates radiometer soil moisture retrievals and high-resolution radar observations and it can provide soil moisture estimates at a finer scale than the radiometer data alone. In this study, a change detection algorithm was used for disaggregation of coarse resolution passive microwave soil moisture retrievals with radar backscatter coefficients obtained from the higher spatial resolution UAVSAR (Unmanned Air Vehicle Synthetic Aperture Radar) at crop field scale. The accuracy of the disaggregated change in soil moisture was evaluated using ground based soil moisture measurements collected during SMAPVEX12 campaign. The results showed that soil moisture spatial variabilities were better characterized by the disaggregated change in soil moisture estimates at 5 m/800 m resolution as well as a good agreement between disaggregated estimates and in situ measurements. It also showed that VWC (Vegetation Water Content) did not have a big impact on disaggregation algorithm performance, with R-2 of the disaggregated results ranging 0.628-0.794. The 5 m and 800 m resolution disaggregated soil moisture did no show significant difference in statistical performance variables.

AB The strong saline water intrusion in the North Branch of the Yangtze Estuary threatens the freshwater supply of the region in winter half year. Strong northerly winds have been identified as a factor increasing saline water intrusion. However, there are few studies on this subject, and the mechanisms of winds influencing saline water intrusion are still unclear. In the present contribution, we investigate the variation trend of strong wind events during cold outbreaks in winter half year and their correlation with saline water intrusion in the North Branch, together with the processes and mechanism of strong winds increasing saline water intrusion, based on observations and an analytical salt water intrusion model. The results indicate that the strong northerly and northeasterly wind events and saline water intrusion in the North Branch have similar variation trends in 1994-2008, both being relatively weak in the 1990s but being intensified dramatically after 1999. The significant correlation between these two trends suggests that the increase in strong wind events may be one of the factors inducing the enhanced saline water intrusion. Observations and model output show that the strong northerly and northeasterly winds can induce dramatic water level setup, increase of flood-tide current velocities, decrease of ebb-tide velocities, and decrease of freshwater inflow into the North Branch. These changes in combination cause the enhanced intensity of saline water intrusion. The Elanan transport from remote winds results in water level setup at the estuary mouth pumping more seawater into the North Branch, which should be a dominant mechanism inducing the change in hydrodynamics and increase of saline water intrusion.

AB Bayesian averaging of climate models is an important tool in streamflow predictions. Climate models have parametric and structural differences and thus have variable hydrological output. Performance of the individual climate models before they are averaged in a Bayesian framework should be consistent with their respective performance indices in a Bayesian framework to ensure that Bayesian averaging follows the physical process. Priors are required to compute posterior probability distributions in the Bayesian predictions. Robustness of Bayesian predictions therefore depends on use of a suitable prior. In this study, combinations of Bayesian regression model priors and regression parameter priors for streamflow prediction have been evaluated to investigate consistency of streamflow simulation performance of RCMs-individually outside the Bayesian framework, individually inside the Bayesian framework and collectively inside the Bayesian framework-using twelve widely used Bayesian formulations. The performance of RCM streamflow simulations outside the Bayesian framework is evaluated using widely used statistical indices: the Willmott's index of agreement (dl), root mean square error (RMSE), and percent bias error (PBIAS). The performance inside the Bayesian framework is evaluated using posterior inclusion probability (PIP). Results suggest that performance of climate models inside Bayesian framework may not be the same as that outside Bayesian framework. Therefore, there is need for climate model performance evaluation both inside and outside Bayesian framework as a precursor to Bayesian prior selection. For example, the non-Empirical Bayes g-Local (non-EBL)-based Bayesian priors give consistent climate model performance inside and outside Bayesian framework, and therefore is the best prior for simulating high flows. Based on the participating climate models in low flow modelling, the results suggest that both EBL and non-EBL priors can be used in averaging low flow in the Bayesian framework.

ID 2-PARAMETER GAMMA-DISTRIBUTION; CN; DERIVATION
AB The sediment graph models are useful for computation of sediment yield as well as total sediment out flow from watershed. In this study, the analytical development of proposed sediment graph models is based on Soil Moisture Accounting (SMA) procedure coupled Soil Conservation Service-Curve Number (SCS-CN) method, Nash's Instantaneous Unit Sediment Graph (IUSG)model and Power law. This coupling has led to the development of four sediment graph models (SGMs), i.e., SMA-SGM1, SMA-SGM2, SMA-SGM-3 and SMA-SGM4 depending on the four different hydrologic conditions as: (i) initial soil moisture (V-0) = 0 and initial abstraction (I-a) = 0, (ii) initial soil moisture (V-0) not equal OandinitialabstractionIa = 0, (iii) initial soil moisture (V-0) = 0 and (I-a) - 0, and (iv) initial soil moisture (V-0) not equal 0 and initial abstration (I-a) not equal 0, respectively. These models are applied on six natural watersheds with nineteen storm events having different land use/land cover, climatic condition (arid, semi-arid, humid and sub-tropical), rainfall and land slope conditions. The goodness-of-fit statistics is evaluated in terms of Nash Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) and relative error (RE) between observed and simulated (calibrated and validated) sediment graphs. Further, the performance of these models is also compared with the sediment graph model of Bhunya et al. (2010) (BSGM) on all the six study watersheds. It is found that the proposed models perform very well in simulating sediment yield generation process for all the watersheds and show significant improvement over the BSGM model.

AB The intensification of flooding in urban areas and the management of susceptibility areas has become a global issue and has been the subject of several studies in recent decades. The integration of alternative approaches, such as socio-hydrological and socio-technological sciences, has gained prominence in urban space planning and development. The mapping of environmental susceptibility represents a promising alternative for the integrated management of natural disasters. However, for this to be used as a socio-technological tool, transiting to a participative management of urban environment, it is necessary to simplify and reduce the associated costs. In this sense, the objective of this study was to propose a socio-technological tool for the punctual and spatial mapping of the susceptibility to the occurrence of flooding in urban regions. The method is designed to combine ease and low cost of application with a simplified but physically sensitive socio-hydrological assessment of eight factors of influence. The methodological tool was tested in a Brazilian district where entire socio-hydrological scenario of urban flooding in developing countries is observed. The results show that the method can provide a simple and consistent view, reaching an overall accuracy of 73.67% of the flooding points. In general, the method provides information that can support decision-making by government agencies in developed and developing countries, as well as civil society, in relation to participatory urban zoning, drainage management, and water conservation.

AB The rapid movement of water in a complex system of preferential pathways in soils is a common natural phenomenon. However, quantification of the properties of this phenomenon is not easy and such results are not often found in the literature. The paper presents results of quantification of the number of macropores, their relative volume and the ratio of water infiltrating through the macropores for five study sites with stony soils located in a mountain catchment of northern Slovakia. These characteristics were calculated from the saturated and unsaturated soil hydraulic conductivities under the assumptions of the Poiseuille's law. Saturated hydraulic conductivities were estimated by single ring infiltrometer measurements in the field and by falling head method in the laboratory. Unsaturated hydraulic conductivities were estimated by tension infiltration measurements in the field (using a minidisc infiltrometer, Decagon Devices). The largest amount of macropores (defined as the pores with radius larger than 1.5 ram) in the entire soil profile (7-5276 per 1 m(2)) was found at forest sites overgrown by spruce with high to extremely high stoniness. The number of macropores decreased with depth of the soil profile at all study sites. The contribution of macropore flow to water infiltration varied from approximately 63% to almost 100%. Although macropores can conduct a large proportion of water, their relative volume is small (0.001-0.9%). The relative volume of all macropores (active and non-active) estimated from the soil porosity and the water retention function was in the range 2-23%.

ID HISTOMONAS-MELEAGRIDIS; TRANSMISSION; CHICKEN; TURKEYS
AB Heterakis gallinarum is a widely distributed cecal nematode that parasitizes gallinaceous birds including chickens and turkeys. H. gallinarum infection poses a problem for the poultry industry as the nematode egg serves as a vector for the protozoan parasite, Histomonas meleagridis, the causative agent of histomonosis. The only means of detecting H. gallinarum in the environment is microscopic identification of the eggs in soil or feces; however, H. gallinarum eggs are often mistaken for those of Ascaridia gall. Three primer sets were designed from sequences cloned from the H. gallinarum genome to develop a diagnostic PCR. Each of these primer sets amplified a single product from H. gallinarum, but were unable to amplify DNA from H. meleagridis, Ascaridia gall, or Cestode sp. H. gallinarum DNA was amplified from Lumbricus sp. (earthworms) and Alphitobius diaperinus (darkling beetles), confirming that the earthworm acts as a paratenic host for H. gallinarum and suggesting that the darkling beetle may be a carrier for this nematode.

AB In the current study, the egg hatch test (EHT) has been evaluated as an in vitro technique to detect albendazole (ABZ) resistance in Fasciola hepatica. The intra- and inter-assay variations of the EHT were measured by means of the coefficient of variation in different fluke isolates and over time; then, the results of the EHT were compared with the "gold standard" controlled efficacy test, which assesses the in vivo anthelmintic efficacy. The EHT was used later to evaluate the intra-herd variability regarding the level of ABZ resistance in calves infected by the same fluke isolate. Finally, several factors of the initial protocol were modified to improve the simplicity of the assay, including the incubation time of eggs with the drug and the use of eggs collected from faeces. The greatest uniformity between results within the assay and over time until 8 weeks after gallbladder collection (the deadline proposed for egg analysis) was obtained with an ABZ concentration of 0.5 mu M. The length of exposure to ABZ was shown to be critical, as prolonged incubation (15 days) led to a change of ovicidal activity. The ABZ concentration of 0.5 mu M is suggested as a possible discriminating dose to predict ABZ resistance, due to the close agreement between the results of the EHT at an ABZ concentration of 0.5 mu M and those of the in vivo assays.

AB Foraging behavior by parasitized herbivores can be interpreted as a decision-making process where individuals are faced with trading-off the ingestion of nutrients with the ingestion of potentially medicinal -and toxic- plant secondary compounds. We determined how parasitized sheep prioritize selection of crude protein, energy and a medicinal plant secondary compound (quebracho tannins-QT). Foraging preferences were tested in 40 lambs before experiencing a parasitic infection (Phase 1), during an infection (Phase 2; 10,000 L-3 Haemonchus contortus per lamb) and after chemotherapy (Phase 3). Lambs were assigned to four groups (10 lambs/group) such that animals in Group 1 (Control) could choose between foods of high (HEP) or low (LEP) energy to protein ratios. The other groups received the same choice, but QT were added (4%) to HEP (Group 2), to LEP (Group 3) or to both foods (Group 4). All groups under a parasitic infection (Phase 2) increased their preference for HEP (from 0.44 to 0.66 +/- 0.042; P < 0.05) and intake of digestible energy (from 0.106 to 0.126 +/- 0.007 Mcal/kg BW; P < 0.05) relative to Phase 1, a pattern that remained during Phase 3. Only lambs receiving QT in HEP increased their intake of QT from Phase 1 to Phase 2 (P < 0.05). Fecal egg counts and blood parameters revealed a parasitic infection (P < 0.05) in Phase 2 that subsided in Phase 3, although no differences were detected among groups (P > 0.05). The importance of protein nutrition on parasitized animals has been highlighted before, but these results suggest that lambs prioritized the ingestion of energy-dense over protein-dense foods or medicinal condensed tannins when challenged by gastrointestinal parasitism. Consumption of medicinal tannins represented a side-effect of the preference manifested for energy-dense foods during testing.

AB Babesia rossi causes the most severe clinical disease in dogs of all the babesia parasites. We included 320 naturally-infected dogs that presented for care at the Onderstepoort Veterinary Academic Hospital between 2006 and 2016. All dogs had mono-infections confirmed by multiplex PCR. The data allowed more accurate clinical classification of the disease and identified parameters that were associated with disease severity and death. Odds ratios for dying were significant (P < 0.05) for increased band neutrophil count, collapse at presentation; presence of cerebral signs; hypoglycaemia; hyperlactatemia; high urea, high creatinine; hyperbilirubinaemia; hypercortisolaemia; and hypothyroxinaemia. Joint component analysis confirmed that the variables with significant odds ratios grouped together with death. Yet, multivariate logistic regression was unable to identify a group of significant independent predictors of death. Receiver Operator Characteristic curves indicated that low total thyroid hormone, high bilirubin, high serum urea and high cortisol concentrations were the variables with the highest sensitivity and specificity for death. These data provide both the clinician and researcher with a set of easily-measured laboratory and clinical assessments to classify cases into those that are uncomplicated and those that are complicated. The disease is complex and multisystemic and probably involves mechanisms more proximal in the pathogenesis than those that have been evaluated.

AB The recovery of fenbendazole efficacy against Haemonchus contortus was attempted in a sheep intensive production system, using a strategy of population replacement in which the initial absolute efficacy of fenbendazole was 0%. The strategy was based on managing the parasite populations in refugia. Firstly, the resistant parasite population was reduced by means of anthelmintic treatments with efficacious drugs (Phase I), then a new, susceptible population was introduced in summer by way of artificially infected lambs at weaning, which were left to graze on the experimental pasture for eleven months (Phase II). Lastly, the impact of the replacement strategy, in terms of benzimidazole efficacy, was measured (Phase III). Faecal egg counts from permanent lambs and worm burdens as a measure of pasture infectivity from tracer lambs were determined throughout the study. During Phase I, faecal egg counts diminished from a peak of 2968 (300-7740) epg to 0 epg at the end, while adult worm burdens of H. contortus were reduced from 2625 (800-5100) to 0, which showed that the treatment strategy used in Phase I was effective in reducing the resistant population. These parameters also showed that good levels of pasture contamination and infectivity were achieved in Phase II, as faecal egg counts of up to 7275 (3240-13080) epg and adult worm burdens of 500 (200-800) H. contortus were reached. The absolute benzimidazole efficacy on H. contortus estimated at 16 months post-population replacement (Phase III) was 97.58%. The results lead to the conclusion that the recovery of anthelmintic efficacy of fenbendazole against a resistant population of H. contortus may be achieved by means of a strategy based on management of refugia and a subsequent introduction of a susceptible population. This strategy might be translatable to other resistant nematode genera.

AB A nucleoside triphosphate diphosphohydrolase-1 (NTPDase 1) was identified on the surface, flagellum and kinetoplast from L. infantum promastigotes by immunocytochemistry and confocal laser scanning microscopy, using immune sera that recognized specifically the B domain of NTPDase 1 and produced against synthetic peptides (LbB1LJ and LbB2LJ) derived from this domain. The polyclonal antibodies had effective antileishmanial effect, reducing significantly in vitro promastigotes growth (21-25%), an antiproliferative effect also demonstrated by immune sera produced against recombinant r-pot B domain, and two other synthetic peptides (potB1LJ and potB2LJ). In addition, using these biomolecules in ELISA technique, IgG1 and IgG2 subclasses reactivities of either healthy dogs or infected by L. infantum and classified clinically as asymptomatic, oligo-symptomatic and symptomatic were tested. Analysis of distinct IgG1 and IgG2 seropositivities patterns suggested antibody subclasses binding epitopes along B domain for protection against infection, indicating this domain as a new tool for prophylactic and immunotherapeutic investigations.

AB Cryptosporidium parvum is a protozoan parasite of the phylum Apicomplexa responsible for cryptosporidiosis in calves, a disease that causes significant diarrhea and impairs gain of body weight, generating important production losses. As to now, no effective drugs or vaccines are available for the treatment or prevention of bovine cryptosporidiosis. Several reports suggest that development of a vaccine to prevent cryptosporidiosis is feasible, but relatively few vaccine candidates have been characterized and tested. The most prominent C. parvum antigen is gp60, an O-glycosylated mucin-like protein tethered to the parasite membrane by a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor. Gp60 has been shown to be involved in essential mechanisms for the survival of C. parvum, such as recognition, adhesion to, and invasion of host cells. This work was aimed at expressing gp60 in Tetrahymena thermophila, a ciliated protozoon with numerous advantages for the heterologous expression of eukaryotic proteins, as a first approach for the development of a recombinant vaccine for bovine cryptosporidiosis. T. thermophila-expressed gp60 localized to the protozoon cell surface and oral apparatus, and partitioned into the Triton X-114 detergent phase. This indicates that the protein entered the reticuloendothelial system of the ciliate, and suggests it contains a GPI-anchor. Homogenates of gp60-expressing T. thermophila cells were recognized by sera from calves naturally infected with C. parvum demonstrating their immunoreactivity. In summary, the heterologous expression of gp60, a C. parvum-encoded GPI-anchored protein, has been successfully demonstrated in the ciliate T. thermophila.

AB The consumption of undercooked infected chicken can be a source of infection for humans and carnivores regarding the zoonotic protozoan parasite Toxoplasma gondii. Furthermore, free-range chickens are sentinels for the presence of T. gondii oocysts in the environment because they feed from the ground. By using the modified agglutination test (MAT), we investigated the presence of antibodies to T. gondii in 178 free-range and 170 broiler chickens raised indoors and slaughtered in Portugal. Prevalence of specific antibodies was 5.6% in free-range and 0.0% in broiler chickens raised indoors (p = 0.002).

AB The treatment of canine heartworm has been modified over the years, adding improvements for greater efficacy, safeness and better prognosis. Currently, the recommended adulticidal protocol consists of the administration of three doses of melarsomine dihydrochloride, preceded by the administration of macrocyclic lactones over two to three months. The objective of this study was to evaluate a variation of the adulticide protocol of heartworm in 76 dogs infected by Dirofilaria immitis, which consists of the pre-administration of macrocyclic lactones (ivermectin) during a single month. On the day of diagnosis, presence of circulating microfilariae was determined and an echocardiography was performed to assess the parasite burden. Treatment began on day 0, with doxycycline for 30 days (10 mg/kg BID) and monthly ivermectin (6mcg/kg). On day 30, the first dose of melarsomine dihydrochloride was administered, followed by a second and third dose on days 60 and 61, respectively. On day 90, the dogs were examined and discharged. Six months after the last dose, all dogs were negative to the presence of antigens and amicrofilaremic. Also, 38.1% of animals were evaluated by echocardiography, showing absence of adult parasites. It is considered that the ineffectiveness of melarsomine against worms < 4 months should be avoided by the previous administration of macrocyclic lactones for two to three months, killing larvae < 2 months while older filariae are allowed to mature to be susceptible to melarsomine dihydrochloride. With this protocol, this gap would be covered for the 2nd and 3rd injections, when worms would be four months and older. In addition, there is evidence that melarsomine is effective against worms under four months and macrocyclic lactones have some efficacy against heartworms older than two months. This modification allows a faster elimination of heartworms and a better compliance from the owners of the infected dogs.

AB The poultry red mite, Dennanyssus gallinae, is a blood-feeding ectoparasite that affects egg-laying hens worldwide. Strategies to control this parasite have focused in the use of entomopathogenic fungi, such as Metarhizium anisopliae. However, only a few studies have evaluated the use of Aspergillus oryzae to control D. gallinae and none of them have employed native strains. In the work presented here, a novel entomopathogenic fungus was isolated from a dead D. gallinae. The results of phylogenetic analysis showed 100% similarity between the isolated strain and those of two species, A. oryzae and Aspergillus flavus, and 99.82% similarity with A. parviscler-otigenus, which were in the same branch of the Flavi section of the genus Aspergillus. This entomopathogenic fungus was a non-aflatoxin B1 producer, as shown by the presence of aflatoxin B1 in the conidial infection suspension. Morphological features of fungus in comparison with A. oryzae and A. flavus indicated that the isolated strain belonged to A. oryzae, and was named Aspergillus sp. Dg-1. The pathogenicity of Aspergillus sp. Dg-1 on D. gallinae at different life stages was then assessed under laboratory conditions. The experiments showed that the isolated strain significantly increased the mortality rate in adult mites, up to 24.83 +/- 2.25, compared to the mortality rates in the control group, which were 15.17 +/- 2.75 (P < 0.05). However, Aspergillus sp. Dg-1 did not have pathogenic effects on the second nymph stage of D. gallinae. Our findings demonstrate that Aspergillus sp. Dg-1 has pathogenic effects on D. gallinae in their adult stage, presenting biocontrol potential against D. gallinae.

AB The present study aimed to evaluate the viability of Haemonchus placei parasitism in experimentally infected goats. For that, 14 75 days old kids male Saanen kids were placed in one of the four experimental groups: GI - infected with 5000 H. placei L3 (n = 4); Gil infected with 5000 H. contortus L3 (n = 4); GIII infected with 2500 H. contortus L3 + 2500 H. placei L3 (n = 4), and GIV - control, inoculated with distilled water (n = 2). Each kid received, orally, the infective dose in a single inoculum. Based on daily fecal egg counts, the average pre-patent period was determined as 24 days for H. contortus, and 31 days for H. placei. Regarding the Haemonchus spp. recovered at necropsy, the experimental groups GI, GII, and GIII had, respectively, an average of 25.5, 619.5, and 724.75 (120 H. placei, and 604.75 H. contortus) adult specimens, and no immature forms. Under the conditions of this study, the viability of goat infection by H. placei was confirmed, although, with low susceptibility. Nevertheless, the parasitism of this helminth species was more intense when associated with H. contortus. This fact indicates that in common grazing between cattle and young goats, when the latter end up ingesting both Haemonhcus species, especially in a mixed infection, H. placei may also parasitize them.

AB Theileria equi infection, exotic to the United States has reemerged through intravenous (iatrogenic) and tick borne transmission. Surveillance at the US-Mexico border identified a new species, Theileria haneyi, (T. haneyi(EP)) (EP = Eagle Pass, Texas) which warranted additional investigation due to inability to detect by PCR targeting of T. equi ema-1 and EMA-1-cELISA validated for T. equi. Infection dynamics of T. haneyi(EP) were evaluated, including ability to superinfect in the presence of T. equi-Texas (T. equil(TN)), the isolate responsible for the re-emergence of T. equi in the U S. Experimental infection with T. equi(TX) or T. haneyi(EP) revealed minimal clinical disease however, T. equi(TX) infection led to significantly greater neutropenia. Comparison of time to antibody detection following inoculation revealed significantly greater time to detectable anti-T. haneyi(EP) antibody (26.67 days post-inoculation (DPI)) than T. equi(TX) (11.67 DPI). Regardless of initial infection with either T. equi(TX) or T. haneyi(EP), superinfection was established. Comparative analysis of antibody responses from a splenectomized horse infected with T. haneyi(EP) to that of a spleen intact horse infected with T. equi(FL) revealed a different antibody binding profile to T. haneyi(EP), T. equi(TX) and T. equi(FL) merozoite antigen and limited shared antigen/cross-reactive antibody(s). Affinity purified T. equi EMA-1 and EMA-2 from T. equi(FL) were shown as targets for horse antibodies against T. haneyi. Data presented here show (1) T. haneyi(EP) can superinfect in the presence of T. equi(TX) infection and co-persists for minimally 25 months, (2) intravenous challenge with T. haneyi is subclinical, and (3) limited cross-reactive antibody between T. haneyi(EP) and T. equi includes reactivity to EMA-1 and EMA-2.

AB The equine Parascaris spp. is large, parasitic nematodes, and predominantly focuses on the intestine of foals and young weanlings. There are two roundworms, Parascaris equorum and Parascaris univalens, recognized among equine hosts. In this study, all fifty-nine Parascaris worms were harvested from three different equine hosts (twenty specimens from Equus zebra, twenty specimens from E. caballus, and nineteen specimens from E. asinus). The ribosomal gene (ITS) and mitochondrial genes (cox1 and nadh1) were amplified to identify and genetically characterize these worms. Analysis of ITS sequences revealed five genotypes among the fifty-nine worms, and the sequence similarity among the worms from E. zebra and E. caballus was at a high level (99.87%), while the one of E. asinus worms showed an apparent difference from the worms either from the E. zebra or from the E. caballus (sequence similarity ranging from 93.04 to 93.42%). Analysis of mitochondrial genes revealed that twenty-one (cox1 gene) and thirteen (nadh1 gene) unique haplotypes were defined among the fifty-nine worms. The shared haplotypes (four cox1 haplotypes and one nadh1 haplotype) only occurred between the worm populations from E. zebra and E. caballus. The cox1 and nadh1 haplotype sequences were respectively applied to construct phylogenetic trees. Although the topologies showed that E. asinus worm population had an obvious boundary with the worm populations of the E. zebra and the E. caballus, however, no noticeable boundary was found within the two later worm populations. Meanwhile, the E. asinus worm population showed an obvious genetic differentiation and an extremely low gene flow (close to zero) with the worm populations from E. zebra and E. caballus, indicating that the genetic characteristics of the worms from the E. asinus have an obvious difference with the one from E. zebra and E. caballus.

AB The ability of the small-subunit ribosomal RNA (SSU rRNA) based nested PCR and Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) to identify and genotype a single Cryptosporidium oocyst isolated from bovine faecal samples was evaluated in this study. In addition, subtyping was carried out by sequencing the 60 kDa glycoprotein (gp60) gene from the same single oocyst. Faecal samples were collected from 40 pre-weaned calves (5-20 days old) from 7 dairy farms located in 3 different counties within the Finger Lakes region of Upstate New York. All the samples were microscopically positive for Cryptosporidium spp. A total of 400 Cryptosporidium oocysts (10 single oocysts from each calf sample) were individually isolated and analyzed using a nested PCR targeting the SSU rRNA gene. The SSU rRNA gene was amplified in 324 (81%) individual oocysts. All SSU rRNA amplified individual oocysts DNA was genotyped using PCR-RFLP. C. parvum was the only identified species; 107 single oocysts generated PCR products from the A gene, 18 generated PCR products from the B gene and 199 generated PCR products from both. Sequence analysis of the gp60 gene in 99 individual oocysts revealed the presence of only subtype IIaA15G2R1 with 99.4-100% and 99.1-100% identity of nucleotides and amino acids, respectively. These sequences were identical (100%) in oocysts from 35 calves and exhibited mutations in the non-repeat region of the 12)60 gene in those of 5 other calves. The examination of DNA from individual oocysts with gen-otyping and subtyping tools provides methodology to more clearly define the genetic characteristics of Cryptosporidium spp. on farms and within individual animals.

AB The natural history of canine visceral leishmaniasis (CVL) has been well described, particularly with respect to the parasite load in different tissues and immunopathological changes according to the progression of clinical forms. The biomarkers evaluated in these studies provide support for the improvement of the tools used in developing vaccines against CVL. Thus, we describe the major studies using the dog model that supplies the rationale for including different biomarkers (tissue parasitism, histopathology, hematological changes, leuco-cytes immunophenotyping, cytokines patterns, and in vitro co-culture systems using purified T-cells subsets and macrophages infected with L. infantum) for immunogenicity and protection evaluations in phases I and II applied to pre-clinical and clinical vaccine trials against CVL. The search for biomarkers related to resistance or susceptibility has revealed a mixed cytokine profile with a prominent proinflammatory immune response as relevant for Leishmania replication at low levels as observed in asymptomatic dogs (highlighted by high levels of IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha and decreased levels in IL-4, TGF-beta and IL-10). Furthermore, increased levels in CD4(+) and CD8(+) T-cell subsets, presenting intracytoplasmic proinflammatory cytokine balance, have been associated with a resistance profile against CVL. In contrast, a polyclonal B-cell expansion towards plasma cell differentiation contributes to high antibody production, which is the hallmark of symptomatic dogs associated with high susceptibility in CVL. Finally, the different studies used to analyze biomarkers have been incorporated into vaccine immunogenicity and protection evaluations. Those biomarkers identified as resistance or susceptibility markers in CVL have been used to evaluate the vaccine performance against L. infantum in a kennel trial conducted before the field trial in an area known to be endemic for visceral leishmaniasis. This rationale has been a guiding force in the testing and selection of the best vaccine candidates against CVL and provides a way for the veterinary industry to register commercial immunobiological products.

AB Background: The impact of hospitalization on patient outcomes is increasingly recognized and considered in the prognostication of many pulmonary disorders. We sought to evaluate the impact of hospitalization on survival in connective tissue disease-interstitial lung disease (CTD-ILD) patients.
   Methods: A chart review of patients with CTD-ILD followed at a tertiary care center was performed. Patients were stratified into two groups based on hospitalization status. Outcomes of the groups were compared using Kaplan-Meier survival analyses as well as multivariate competing risk analysis.
   Results: There were 137 patients identified with confirmed CTD-ILD. Patients who underwent hospitalization for any reason had a significant decrease in transplant-free survival compared to the never hospitalized cohort (3-year survival 60% vs. 94%; p=0.0001). Hospitalization for >= 7 days was associated with worse outcomes than those hospitalized for < 7 days (median survival 1.59 years vs. 7.17 years, p=0.0012). Based on multivariate competing risk analysis, factors associated with death, with lung transplantation as a competing risk, were age (HR=1.05 [95% 1.01-1.09]; P=0.0443), male gender (HR=4.94 [95% CI: 1.58-15.41]; P=0.006), and all cause hospitalization (HR=11.97 [95% CI: 1.36-105.49]; P=0.0253).
   Conclusion: This study highlights the impact of hospitalization on subsequent outcomes in the CTD-ILD population with a significantly reduced transplant-free survival demonstrated, especially after cardiopulmonary hospitalization events.

AB Background: Interstitial lung disease-associated antisynthetase syndrome (AS-ILD) carries significant morbidity and mortality. Corticosteroids and immunosuppressive drugs are the mainstay of treatment. Human immunoglobulin (IVIg), an immunomodulator without immunosuppressive properties, is effective in myositis but the evidence supporting its use in ILD is scarce.
   Objective: To describe clinical outcomes of AS-ILD patients receiving IVIg.
   Methods: Retrospective analysis of AS-ILD patients. Linear mixed models using restricted maximum likelihood estimation was used to estimate the change in lung function and corticosteroid dose over time.
   Results: Data from 17 patients was analyzed. Median follow-up was 24.6 months. Fourteen patients had refractory disease. The mean percent-predicted forced vital capacity (FVC%) (p=0.048) and percent-predicted diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (DLCO%) (p=0.0223) increased over time, while the mean prednisone dose (p<0.001) decreased over time. Seven patients achieved a>10% increase in FVC%, including two who used IVIg as initial treatment. Five patients showed a>10% increase in DLCO% and TLC%. Nine (53%) patients experienced side effects.
   Conclusions: IVIg may be a useful complementary therapy in active progressive AS-ILD but is associated with potential side effects. Fssssurther investigation is required to determine the value of IVIg as an initial treatment in AS-ILD.

AB Objective: To assess the incidence and determinants of the triple inhaled therapy in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) primary care patients.
   Methods: Data derived from the Health Search Database (HSD) gathering information on 700 Italian general practitioners. A cohort of COPD patients, prescribed for the first time with inhaled treatments, was followed-up between January 2002 and December 2014. The outcome was the first incident prescription of a triple inhaled therapy, namely the combination of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS), long-acting beta agonists (LABA), and long-acting muscarinic antagonists (LAMA). Cox regressions were used to test the association (hazard ratios, HR) between candidate determinants and the outcome.
   Results: Out of 17589 patients (mean age 71.1 +/- 11.3 years; 37.4% females), 3693 (21%) were prescribed with a triple inhaled therapy during follow-up. Older age (HR=1.79 to 2.61), current and former smoking habit (HR=1.72 and 1.66), higher GOLD stage (HR=1.45 to 2.79), the number of moderate and severe COPD exacerbations (HR=1.10 to 2.63), and heart failure (HR=1.17) resulted statistically significantly associated with an increased incident prescription of the triple inhaled therapy. Female sex (HR=0.80) and some co-morbidities (HR=0.21 to 0.87) resulted negatively associated with the outcome. Furthermore, patients initially treated with LAMA (HR=1.5) and LABA/ICS (HR=1.23) were more likely to escalate to the triple therapy, than those on LABA. Conversely, patients initially treated with ICS presented a negative hazard (HR=0.72).
   Conclusions: The knowledge of demographic and clinical determinants of the escalation to the triple inhaled therapy in real-world COPD patients may help clinicians to better personalize respiratory pharmacological treatments of their patients, and inform international societies that issue clinical guidelines.

AB Rationale: Alterations of acid-base metabolism are an important outcome predictor in acute exacerbations of COPD, whereas sufficient metabolic compensation and adequate renal function are associated with decreased mortality. In stable COPD there is, however, only limited information on the combined role of acid-base balance, blood gases, renal and respiratory function on exacerbation risk grading.
   Methods: We used baseline data of the COPD cohort COSYCONET, applying linear and logistic regression analyses, the results of which were implemented into a comprehensive structural equation model. As most informative parameters it comprised the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), lung function defined via forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1), intrathoracic gas volume (ITGV) and (diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO), moreover arterial oxygen content (CaO2), partial pressure of oxygen (PaCO2), base exess (BE) and exacerbation risk according to GOLD criteria. All measures were adjusted for age, gender, body-mass index, the current smoking status and pack years.
   Results: 1506 patients with stable COPD (GOLD grade 1-4; mean age 64.5 +/- 8.1 y; mean FEV1 54 +/- 18 % predicted, mean eGFR 82.3 +/- 16.9 mL/min/1.73m(2)) were included. BE was linked to eGFR, lung function and PaCO2 and played a role as indirect predictor of exacerbation risk via these measures; moreover, eGFR was directly linked to exacerbation risk. These associations remained significant after taking into account medication (diuretics, oral and inhaled corticosteroids), whereby corticosteroids had effects on exacerbation risk and lung function, diuretics on eGFR, BE and lung function.
   Conclusion: Even in stable COPD acid-base metabolism plays a key integrative role in COPD risk assessment despite rather small deviations from normality. It partially mediates the effects of impairments in kidney function, which are also directly linked to exacerbation risk.

AB Introduction: Maintenance treatment with macrolides are useful in preventing COPD exacerbations. We investigated which characteristics of COPD patients with frequent exacerbations predicted the best response to maintenance treatment with azithromycin.
   Methods: This study was part of the COLUMBUS trial, a prospective randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in 92 COPD patients with frequent exacerbations. During the 1-year treatment period, follow-up data were collected for spirometry, mMRC scores, sputum cultures and blood inflammatory markers.
   Results: In the azithromycin group a significant lower number of exacerbations per patient was observed in patients with the following characteristics: baseline blood eosinophil count >= 2.0% ((x) over bar =1.26), compared to an eosinophil count <2.0% (<(x)over bar>=2.50; p=0.02), GOLD stage 1-2 ((x) over bar =1.06), versus GOLD stage 4 ((x) over bar =2.62; p=0.02) and GOLD group C ((x) over bar =0.45) compared to group D ((x) over bar =2.18; p <0.01). Moreover, the number of hospitalizations was significantly lower in patients, with a blood eosinophil count >= 2.0% (<(x)over bar>=0.26) compared to an eosinophil count <2.0% (<(x)over bar>=0.90; p=0.01) and in GOLD stages 1-2 ((x) over bar =1.06) compared to stage 4 ((x) over bar =2.62; p=0.04).
   Conclusion: In conclusion, azithromycin maintenance treatment appears to be effective in COPD patients with frequent exacerbations, who are either classified in GOLD stage 1-2 or GOLD C and those with a blood eosinophil count of >= 2.0%.

AB Introduction: Our aim was to describe how the prevalence of subjects exposed to environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) has changed from 1992 to 2012 in Finland. We also investigated the association between ETS and chronic bronchitis and cause-specific and all-cause mortality.
   Methods: The study population is composed of 38 494 subjects aged 25-74 years who participated in the National FINRISK Study between 1992 and 2012. Each survey included a standardized questionnaire on exposure to ETS, symptoms of chronic bronchitis, smoking habits and other risk factors, and clinical measurements at the study site. Data on mortality was obtained from the National Causes of Death Register.
   Results: In 2012, 5% of the participants were exposed to ETS compared to 25% in 1992. The adjusted odds ratio (OR) for ETS exposure in 2012 compared with that in 1992 was 0.27, p < 0.001. Exposure to ETS was more common in men than in women and among smokers than in non-smokers. Exposure to ETS was in turn associated with chronic bronchitis, OR 1.63 (95% confidence interval 1.49-1.78),-also separately both at work (OR 1.36) and at home (OR 1.69). Subjects with exposure to ETS had significantly increased all-cause (hazard ratio=HR 1.15, 1.05-1.26) and cardiovascular mortality (HR 1.26, 1.07-1.47). However, when stratified by smoking ETS was associated with all-cause mortality only in smokers (HR 1.31, 1.15-1.48).
   Conclusion: The proportion of subjects exposed to ETS decreased substantially during the study. Additionally, ETS exposure was associated with chronic bronchitis throughout the study and increased all-cause and cardiovascular mortality.

TI Mucoid Pseudomonas aeruginosa alters sputum viscoelasticity in patients

   INFECTION; MORTALITY; AIRWAY; TIME
AB Introduction and aim: Pseudomonas aeruginosa could acquire a mucoid phenotype due to mutations in mucA (mucoid Pseudomonas aeruginosa-mPA) that is a hallmark of poor prognosis in patients with bronchiectasis. Despite the higher prevalence of Pseudomonas aeruginosa in bronchiectasis, how mPA and non-mucoid Pseudomonas aeruginosa (non-mPA) phenotypes could affect viscoelastic properties of sputum is unknown. Our aim was to determine the relationship between Pseudomonas aeruginosa phenotypes isolation, the viscoelastic properties of sputum and the clinical outcomes in patients with bronchiectasis.
   Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted of sputum samples obtained by spontaneous expectoration and sent for microbiology and rheology analysis. Elasticity and viscosity were measured at two oscillatory frequencies (1 and 100 rad/s). Socio-demographic and clinical data were recorded.
   Results: We analyzed 17 patients with mPA, 14 with non-mPA and 17 with no organism reported (NOR). Compared with the NOR group, the mPA group showed higher elasticity (median 10.30 vs. 5.70, p=0.023), viscosity (2.40 vs. 1.50, p=0.039), and stiffness (10.70 vs. 6.00, p=0.024). Values in the mPA group tended to be higher compared with non-mPA. Clinically, the mPA group showed greater hospitalizations during the previous year and greater affected lobes than the non-mPA and NOR groups.
   Conclusions: The mPA phenotype is associated with increased elasticity, viscosity and stiffness of bronchiectatic sputum. Viscoelastic properties could be used as a marker of poor mucociliary clearance in mPA, with potentially important clinical implications.

AB Objective: Tiotropium is a long-acting muscarinic antagonist approved for maintenance treatment of asthma in children, adolescents, and adults in the United States, and recommended as add-on treatment for uncontrolled asthma despite treatment with inhaled corticosteroids and/or long-acting beta-2 agonists. This review traces the journey of tiotropium from its historical origins through early preclinical testing to human clinical trials and real-life studies.
   Data sources: A search was performed in PubMed using search terms 'tiotropium' and 'asthma.' Relevant references cited in those articles were reviewed.
   Study selections: English language articles published from December 2008-December 2018 were screened. Articles evaluating the efficacy, cost-effectiveness, real-life evidence, and steroid-sparing effect of tiotropium with inadequately controlled asthma were included.
   Results: Anticholinergics have a long history of use in the treatment of obstructive airway diseases. Evidence indicates that tiotropium's mechanism of action consists of bronchodilation and diminished mucus secretion, with preclinical evidence suggesting an anti-inflammatory effect as well. Phase 2 and 3 clinical trials have demonstrated that tiotropium is efficacious and safe, resulting in significant improvements in lung function in adults, adolescents, and children across asthma severities. Emerging evidence suggests that add-on tiotropium might potentially enable reductions in inhaled corticosteroid dose in patients with uncontrolled asthma. Further, tiotropium is a cost-effective treatment option that is also effective in the clinical practice setting.
   Conclusions: An increasing body of evidence indicates that tiotropium can play a significant role in the treatment of patients with uncontrolled asthma.

AB Background: Asthma is currently divided into different phenotypes, with age at onset as a relevant differentiating factor. In addition, asthma with onset in adulthood seems to have a poorer prognosis, but studies investigating age-specific incidence of asthma with a wide age span are scarce.
   Objective: To evaluate incidence of asthma diagnosis at different ages and differences between child- and adult-diagnosed asthma in a large population-based study, with gender-specific analyzes included.
   Methods: In 2016, a respiratory questionnaire was sent to 8000 randomly selected subjects aged 20-69 years in western Finland. After two reminders, 4173 (52.3%) subjects responded. Incidence rate of asthma was retrospectively estimated based on the reported age of asthma onset. Adult-diagnosed asthma was defined as a physician-diagnosis of asthma made at >= 18 years of age.
   Results: Among those with physician-diagnosed asthma, altogether, 63.7% of subjects, 58.4% of men and 67.8% of women, reported adult-diagnosed asthma. Incidence of asthma diagnosis was calculated in 10-year age groups and it peaked in young boys (0-9 years) and middle-aged women (40-49 years) and the average incidence rate during the examined period between 1946 and 2015 was 2.2/1000/year. Adult-diagnosed asthma became the dominant phenotype among those with physician-diagnosed asthma by age of 50 years and 38 years in men and women, respectively.
   Conclusions: Asthma is mainly diagnosed during adulthood and the incidence of asthma diagnosis peaks in middle-aged women. Asthma diagnosed in adulthood should be considered more in clinical practice and management guidelines.

AB Background: Lung function is inversely associated with coronary heart disease and cardiovascular disease. High-sensitive cardiac troponin T (hs-cTnT) was recently found to represent early subclinical cardiac disease even in healthy individuals. We explored the inter-relationship between lung function and hs-cTnT and the changes over time in these two measurements.
   Methods: Lung function test and hs-cTnT were determined in apparently healthy individuals from the Tel Aviv Medical Center Inflammatory Survey. Participants with normal lung function were followed up for 5 years in order to evaluate the effect of lung function deterioration on hs-cTnT levels. The correlation between annual Forced vital capacity (FVC) % predicted decline and hs-cTnT levels were analyzed.
   Results: A 5-year follow-up of 2,618 participants with normal lung function at baseline revealed a mean annual FVC deterioration of 31.9 (+/- 91.3) ml/year. Lung function decline>5% was associated with an increased risk of having hs-cTnT>5 ng/L (Exp. beta=1.55 1.20-1.99, p=0.001). Delta FVC between two consecutive visits was inversely correlated with an increase of hs-cTnT (r=-0.24, p<0.001).
   Conclusions: Deterioration of lung function predicts elevated troponin levels and may be a sign of early sub-clinical cardiac disease.

AB Background: Patients with severe asthma can present with overlapping eosinophilic and allergic phenotypes, which makes it challenging when deciding which biologic therapy is most appropriate to reduce exacerbations and help achieve asthma control.
   Objective: This post hoc meta-analysis evaluated the efficacy of the licensed dose of mepolizumab (100 mg administered subcutaneously [SC]) versus placebo in patients with severe eosinophilic asthma (SEA), according to omalizumab eligibility and associated allergic characteristics.
   Methods: Data from two Phase 3 studies (MENSA [MEA115588/NCT01691521]; MUSCA [200862/NCT02281318]) were analyzed. Patients >= 12 years of age with SEA who experienced >= 2 exacerbations in the previous year received placebo, mepolizumab 100 mg SC or 75 mg intravenously, plus standard of care (high-dose inhaled corticosteroids and other controllers), every 4 weeks. Data from patients who received >= 1 dose placebo or mepolizumab 100 mg SC were used for this analysis. The primary endpoint was the rate of clinically significant exacerbations; other outcomes included forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1), Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ-5) score and quality of life measured using St George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ).
   Results: Rate reductions in clinically significant exacerbations with mepolizumab versus placebo were similar in omalizumab eligible and ineligible patients (57% vs 55%). FEV1, ACQ-5 and SGRQ scores improved with mepolizumab versus placebo regardless of omalizumab eligibility, Immunoglobulin E levels, or atopic status.
   Conclusion: This analysis indicated that mepolizumab 100 mg SC has clinical benefit in patients with blood eosinophil counts >= 150 cells/mu L (or history of >= 300 cells/mu L), regardless of allergic characteristics or omalizumab eligibility.

AB Background: Exercise-induced airway symptoms are common in adolescents. Little is known about the development of symptoms from adolescence to early adulthood. Therefore, we studied the prevalence, incidence, and remission of exercise-induced airway symptoms (including wheeze, cough, chest and throat tightness, hoarseness, and stridor) in adolescents, over a five-year period.
   Methods: In 2011, all adolescents aged 12-13 years in Uppsala (n=3 838) were invited to answer a questionnaire on exercise-induced airway symptoms. All responding adolescents (n=2 309) were invited to answer the same questionnaire again after five years. In total, 1 002 adolescents responded (43.4%).
   Results: The prevalence of exercise-induced airway symptoms increased from 25% at baseline to 49% at follow-up (p<0.001). More females than males reported symptoms at both time points. The incidence of airway symptoms was 42.2%, with no sex differences. More males than females reported symptom remission (20.2 vs. 10.7%, p<0.001). Females reported a higher asthma prevalence at follow-up than at baseline (7.6 vs. 15.2%), while males did not (10.9 vs. 8.0%), leading to a sex difference in prevalence at follow-up (p<0.001). Smoking and baseline respiratory symptoms were associated with an increased risk of reporting symptoms at follow-up.
   Conclusions: A twofold increase in the prevalence of exercise-induced airway symptoms over a five-year period was found in this cohort. Females were more likely to report symptoms at both time points. Knowledge of these age-related changes in symptoms and their association to female gender is useful for future studies and healthcare providers.

ID IDIOPATHIC PULMONARY-FIBROSIS; PIRFENIDONE
AB While there is a good knowledge of the natural course of lung function in interstitial lung diseases (ILD) like idiopathic lung fibrosis (IPF), many ambiguities remain in patients with asbestosis. Therefore, we evaluated the change in lung function in asbestos exposed subjects with pleural plaques and asbestosis and analysed corresponding morphology of computer tomography of the thorax.
   Methods: 93 asbestos exposed subjects with pleural plaques and asbestosis were analysed retrospectively at the Klinikum Bergmannsheil of the Ruhr-University of Bochum. Parameters of lung function were obtained at least twice and annual changes of FVC, TLC and DLCOsb were calculated. In addition, we assessed the predominant pattern in high-resolution computer tomography of the thorax (HRCT) and differentiated three phenotypes: p (pleural)-type, f (fibrosis)-type and m (mixed)-type.
   Results: FU data are available in 56/93 (60.2%) patients. The annual deterioration (Mean +/- SEM) of FVC is -31.46 +/- 17.34 ml, of TLC -55.55 +/- 25.67 ml, of DLCOsb -0.38 +/- 0.07 mmol/min/kPa and of DLCOva -0.05 +/- 0.01 mmol/min/kPa/L. A categorical change of FVC > -100 ml was found in 12/56 (21.4%) and 18/56 (32.1%) patients showed an annual loss of TLC > -100 ml. The greatest annual decline of FVC was observed in patients with the fibrotic phenotype on HRCT (-76.76 +/- 66.43 ml) and the mixed phenotype (-81.52 +/- 24.79 ml), while the pleural phenotype was less affected (-10.52 +/- 25.07 ml).
   Conclusion: More than 20% of our cohort have a progressive disease with an annual loss of FVC > -100 ml. Patients with the fibrotic-phenotype or mixed-phenotype on HRCT are particularly at risk.

AB Introduction: Preclinical research suggests a role of Glucagon Like Peptide-1 Receptors (GLP-1R) on the regulation of human bronchial tone. We investigated the effect of GLP-1R agonists on lung function of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) population without co-existing chronic obstructive respiratory disorders.
   Methods: This was a prospective cohort study that examined change in lung function measurements over two years of T2DM patients (n= 32) treated with metformin monotherapy (control cohort), metformin plus GLP-1R agonists (GLP-1R agonists cohort), or metformin plus insulin (insulin cohort).
   Results: After 24 months of treatment, the forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) significantly (p < 0.05) increased from baseline in the GLP-1R agonists cohort (218 ml [95% CI 88-246]), but not in the control and insulin cohorts (94 ml [95% CI -28 -216] and 26 ml [95% CI -174 -226], respectively; p > 0.05 vs. baseline). The average increase in FEV1 in the GLP-1R agonists cohort was significantly greater than that in the control and insulin cohorts (delta: 110 ml [95% CI 18-202] and 177 ml [95% CI 85-270], respectively, p < 0.05). The forced vital capacity (FVC) also increased significantly more in the GLP-1R agonists cohort than in the control and insulin cohorts (overall delta FVC: 183 ml [95% CI 72-295], p < 0.05). The maximal expiratory flow at 50-75% significantly (p < 0.05) improved from baseline in the GLP-1R agonists cohort, but not in the control and insulin cohorts (p > 0.05).
   Conclusion: Our preliminary results suggest a potential new therapeutic perspective to treat airway disorders with GLP-1R agonists.

   ASSESSMENT; SOCIETY STATEMENT; PHYSICAL-ACTIVITY; MEPOLIZUMAB; ANXIETY;
   PEOPLE; INFLAMMATION; LIMITATION
AB Background: Severe asthma and bronchiectasis are heterogeneous diseases that contribute to disability beyond the pulmonary system. The magnitude of the impact that these extrapulmonary features has on health-related quality of life (HRQoL) is unknown.
   Methods: We analysed the cross-sectional relationships between HRQoL (St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire; SGRQ) and extrapulmonary characteristics, including physical activity (steps/day), anxiety and depression, isometric leg strength, systemic inflammation, and several comorbidities in adults with severe asthma (n=70) and bronchiectasis (n=61).
   Results: Participants with severe asthma and bronchiectasis had similar SGRQ total scores (mean scores 43.7 and 37.8 for severe asthma and bronchiectasis; p > 0.05), and similar pulmonary and extrapulmonary characteristics. The associations between extrapulmonary variables and HRQoL did not differ according to diagnosis (all interactions p > 0.05). Greater anxiety and depressive symptoms, fewer steps/day and greater systemic inflammation were statistically associated with poorer HRQoL in both diseases (p < 0.05). Lower isometric leg strength in severe asthma, and greater Charlson Comorbidity Index in bronchiectasis were also associated with poorer HRQoL (p < 0.05). In the multivariable regression model performed in the combined disease groups, anxiety and depression, steps/day, systemic inflammation and isometric leg strength remained independently associated with HRQoL. Associations between extrapulmonary characteristics and SGRQ domains were stronger for the activity and impact domains, than symptoms.
   Conclusion: In severe asthma and bronchiectasis, extrapulmonary features including physical activity and leg strength have a significant impact on HRQoL, especially within the activity and impact domains. These features should be considered as part of the assessment of these conditions, and they may represent additional treatment targets to improve HRQoL.

AB Rationale: Although anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibody (ACPA) is highly specific for rheumatoid arthritis (RA), some patients with idiopathic interstitial pneumonia (IIP) are ACPA-positive, but do not fulfill the diagnostic criteria for RA. The clinical significance of ACPA in such patients is as yet unclear.
   Objective: We aimed to investigate the frequency of ACPA positivity and its clinical significance in patients initially diagnosed with IIP.
   Methods: We retrospectively analyzed 370 consecutive patients who were diagnosed with IIP and for whom serum ACPA results were available. The incidence of ACPA positivity and its predictive role for subsequent onset of RA was examined. Risk factors for development of RA were evaluated by Cox hazards analysis.
   Results: Of 370 patients, 24 (6.5%) were ACPA-positive, including 7 of 144 patients (4.9%) initially diagnosed with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and 17 of 226 patients (7.5%) with non-IPF. The cumulative 3-year incidence of overt RA was significantly higher in patients who were positive rather than negative for ACPA (28.9% vs. 1.1%, P < 0.01). On multivariate analysis, younger age was independently associated with development of RA in patients who were ACPA-positive (per one year increase: hazard ratio = 0.93, 95% confidence interval 0.87-0.99, P = 0.03).
   Conclusion: Among patients initially diagnosed with IIP, a small proportion was positive for ACPA, of whom approximately one-third subsequently developed RA within 3 years from IIP diagnosis. Clinicians should be alert to the possibility of RA developing in patients with IIP who are ACPA-positive, particularly those patients who are younger.

AB Introduction: In CF, people with higher FEV1 are less aggressively treated with intravenous (IV) antibiotics, with resultant negative impact on their health outcomes. This could be entirely clinician-driven, but patient choice may also influence IV use. In this prospective observational study, we explored IV recommendations by clinicians and IV acceptance by adults with CF to understand how clinical presentations consistent with exacerbations resulted in IV use.
   Methods: Clinical presentations consistent with exacerbations, IV recommendation by clinicians and IV acceptance by patients were prospectively identified for every adult with CF in Sheffield throughout 2016, excluding those who had lung transplantation (n=7) or on ivacaftor (n=13). Relevant demographic data, e. g. %FEV1, were extracted from medical records. Multi-level mixed-effects logistic regression models were used to compare IV recommendations vs non-recommendations for all clinical encounters, and IV acceptance vs non-acceptance for all IV recommendations.
   Results: Among 186 adults (median age 27 years, median FEV1 78.5%), there were 434 exacerbation events and 318 IV use episodes following 1010 clinical encounters. Only 254 (58.5%) of exacerbations were IV treated. A diagnosis of exacerbation, higher number of symptoms and lower %FEV1 were independent predictors for IV recommendation by clinicians. Higher number of symptoms and lower %FEV1 were also independent predictors for IV acceptance by adults with CF.
   Conclusions: Lower IV use among adults with higher %FEV1 was influenced by both clinicians' and patients' decisions. Using IV antibiotics as an exacerbation surrogate could under-estimate exacerbation rates and conceal differential treatment decisions according to varying clinical characteristics.

AB Background: Dyspnea is a cardinal but often underestimated symptom in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). The newly developed Dyspnea-ALS-Scale (DALS-15) is highly relevant for therapeutic decisions because dyspnea is a separate criterion to consider noninvasive ventilation (NIV) in ALS. In comparison to the limited effects of neuroprotective compounds, NIV has the greatest impact on survival and improves quality of life.
   Objective: To investigate whether dyspnea corresponds to parameters of respiratory status mainly used in clinical neurological practice. We also investigated if the DALS-15 could help identify patients for consideration of NIV in whom neither spirometry nor blood gas parameters indicate the need for NIV (forced vital capacity (FVC) < 50% or probable < 75%, pCO(2) >= 45 mmHg).
   Methods: Seventy ALS patients with dyspnea according to the DALS-15 obtained blood gas analysis and spirometry (FVC in sitting and supine positions). The supine decline in FVC was calculated.
   Results: There was no linear relationship between dyspnea and spirometry as well as blood gases. 83% of our patients had an upright FVC still greater than 50% and no daytime hypercapnia.
   Conclusions: Our study clearly shows that dyspnea can occur independently of objective indicators of respiratory impairment like spirometry or blood gases. Hence, the DALS-15 covers another aspect of respiratory impairment than these tests and refers to the subjective component of respiratory impairment. It detects dyspnea in a considerable proportion of patients in whom NIV should thus be considered although their spirometric and blood gas results do not point towards NIV. The DALS-15 therefore may help to improve the stratification of patients with respiratory impairment for more efficient symptom management and timely coordination of care.

AB Background: Idiopathic pleuroparenchymal fibroelastosis (IPPFE) is a rare form of idiopathic interstitial pneumonias (IIP) and may have other patterns of interstitial lung disease (ILD) in the lower lobe, such as usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP). However, the clinical significance of lower-lobe ILD in patients with IPPFE is unclear.
   Methods: A retrospective review of 40 consecutive patients with clinically diagnosed IPPFE in our institution from 2005 to 2016 was conducted. The presence of lower-lobe ILD on high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) was assessed and classified into UIP or non-UIP pattern according to a modification of diagnostic criteria for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Clinical characteristics and prognostic factors were evaluated.
   Results: Among the 40 patients with IPPFE, 21 (53%) had lower-lobe ILD, including 13 with UIP pattern and 8 with non-UIP pattern. Patients with IPPFE who had lower-lobe ILD had significantly older age, higher frequency of fine crackles, higher serum KL-6 level, lower residual volume (RV), and lower total lung capacity (TLC) than those without lower-lobe ILD. In addition, those with lower-lobe ILD, especially UIP pattern, had a significantly poorer survival than those without lower-lobe ILD (log-rank test; p=0.014, p<0.001, respectively). Multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression analysis revealed that low %forced vital capacity (%FVC) at baseline and coexistence of UIP pattern were significantly associated with poor prognosis in patients with IPPFE.
   Conclusions: The coexistence of lower-lobe ILD on HRCT, especially the UIP pattern, may predict poor survival in patients with IPPFE.

AB Study objectives: Aim of the study was to investigate the association between obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in a cohort of patients with cardiovascular risk factors.
   Methods: In this prospective study, 378 patients of the DIAST-CHF cohort were screened for OSA by home polygraphy. Inclusion criteria were risk factors for diastolic heart failure, such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus, atherosclerotic disease, or history of chronic heart failure. Patients were followed up after 1, 2, 5, 9 and 10 years for the occurrence of major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events (MACE and MACCE).
   Results: 344 patients were included in the analysis, of which 60% were diagnosed with OSA (apnoea-hypopnoea index >= 5/h). Overall mortality was higher in the OSA group (14.9% vs. 5.9%; p=0.007), but significance disappeared after adjustment for age and sex (hazard ratio (HR) 1.89, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.86-4.16, p=0.12). There was no significant difference in the occurrence of MACE or MACCE in patients with OSA compared to those without OSA (MACE: 31% vs. 30%; p=0.61; MACCE: 32% vs. 30%; p=0.53).
   Conclusion: We did not find evidence of an adverse effect of OSA on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in a cohort of patients with cardiovascular risk factors.

   device specific spirometric parameters

AB Introduction: Drug emission from DPIs is dependent on the inspiratory flow parameters through them, which are not directly measured by standard spirometry. Their estimation based on native spirometric data could help in choosing the appropriate device and optimizing the drug deposition.
   Objectives: The aim of this study was to survey patient preferences and to find correlations between breathing parameters of COPD patients through DPI devices and their baseline spirometric data, age, gender, disease severity and anthropometric characteristics. Another objective was to establish relationships between peak inspiratory flows (PIFdev) through Breezhaler (R), Genuair (R) and Turbuhaler (R) inhalers and their determinants.
   Methods: Breathing parameters of 49 patients with previously diagnosed COPD and currently using one of the above inhalers were recorded by normal spirometry and while inhaling through the selected DPIs. Statistical analysis of the measured data was completed. All specific data are provided as (mean +/- standard deviation).
   Results: More than 60% of the patients stated that their current device is the easiest to use. The means of the measured PIFdev values were 91.4 L/min, 77.1 L/min and 77.5 L/min for Breezhaler (R), Genuair (R), and Turbuhaler (R), respectively. PIFdev values were significantly higher for males than for females, but differences upon age, BMI and disease severity group were not significant (at p=0.05). Peak inspiratory flows through the inhalers (PIFdev) correlated best with their native spirometric counterparts (PIF) and linear PIFdev-PIF relationships could be determined (Breezhaler (R) : r=0.60, p=0.002, Genuair (R) : r=0.55, p=0.001, Turbuhaler (R) : r=0.57, p=0.002). Physical background of the deduced equations was also provided.
   Conclusions: Present correlations may be used to assess the success of inhalation of COPD patients through the studied devices and to choose the appropriate device for each patient. As a consequence, the amount of the drug emitted by the device can be optimized, the deposition efficiency within the lungs increased and the related therapeutic effect improved.

TI Bendopnoea in exercise limited patients with COPD
SO RESPIRATORY MEDICINE
LA English
DT Article
DE COPD; Bendopnoea; Breathlessness; Symptoms
AB Dyspnoea on bending over (bendopnoea) is most commonly associated with systolic heart failure. COPD patients often also complain of bendopnoea but little is known about this symptom in this patient group. We objectively assessed 44 COPD patients attending pulmonary rehabilitation for bendopnoea in a tertiary referral centre to determine the potential mechanism and clinical implications of this symptom. Bendopnoea was assessed by timing the duration of onset to breathlessness on bending forward at the waist for 30 s. BORG score, oxygen saturations and blood pressure measurements were obtained before and after. Of 44 patients (mean age +/- SD 66.7 +/- 8.4 years; 22 male, BMI 28.1 +/- 6.4), bendopnoea was present in 23 (52.3%) patients. This was significantly associated with a lower FEV1% (p=0.02) and TLCO% (< 0.001) and higher CAT score (p=0.03). A strong trend was also noted with higher waist/hip ratio (p=0.06). There were no associations with age, BMI, oxygen saturation, static lung volumes, exercise capacity or non-invasive haemodynamic markers such as proBNP, physiological changes or echocardiography findings.

AB Background: Bronchial asthma (BA) is a complex disease characterised by persistent inflammation. Exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) and blood eosinophil count (b-Eos) are biomarkers for type 2 endotype of BA.
   Objective: To analyse a panel of serum interleukins and total IgE in predefined by FeNO and b-Eos groups of moderate and severe BA patients.
   Methods: Serum levels of IL-5, IL-6, IL-8, IL-13 and IL-17A (ELISA) were measured in 30 healthy controls (HC) and 80 adult BA patients. BA patients were split into 4 groups. Group 1: Low FeNO/Low b-Eos (n=23; 28.8%); Group 2: Low FeNO/High b-Eos (n=17; 21.3%); Group 3: High FeNO/Low b-Eos (n=15; 18.8%); Group 4: High FeNO/High b-Eos (n=25; 31.3%).
   Results: All interleukins and total IgE were significantly higher in patients with BA as compared with HC. IL-5 levels were highest in Group 2 (p < 0.05). IL-6, IL-13 and IL-17A levels were elevated in Groups 2, 3 and 4 as compared with HC (p < 0.05). Higher IL-8 levels were associated with a pattern of current smokers. Highest IL-17A levels were found in type 2 high groups with frequent exacerbations, mostly uncontrolled and severe BA. We have found a distinct pattern for each group based on demographic, clinical, functional, immunological and inflammatory characteristics.
   Conclusion: FeNO and b-Eos are useful in the identification of severe type 2 BA subgroups with frequent exacerbations. IL-5, IL-6, IL-13 and IL-17A are involved in the persistent type 2 immune response in moderate and severe BA. We have identified a pattern of refractory, severe type 2/IL-17A high BA in the real clinical practice.

AB Biological control of cyanobacteria is a viable means of controlling nuisance bloom occurrences; however the majority of studies done are against Microcystis sp., with a commonly lytic effect caused. Filamentous cyanobacteria such as Oscillatoria are not as extensively studied in this area of biological control and are often part of Microcystis dominated blooms. This study employed heterotrophic bacteria] isolates selected from bloom waters that indicated potential predatory behaviour against both filamentous and colonial cyanobacterial isolates. In comparison to a known Bacillus isolate, which is often reported among bacterial control agents, three other bacteria isolates were tested as control agents against non-axenic Oscillatoria and Microcystis cyanobacterial cultures. Assessments of cyanobacterial cell responses to the bacteria were conducted through water chemistry, chlorophyll a, alkaline phosphatase activity, microscopy and cyanotoxin measurements. The changes in these parameters were compared to untreated cyanobacterial cultures where no bacteria were added. The study found that at ratios of bacteria half that of Microcystis, minimal changes in chlorophyll a were observed, whilst Oscillatoria showed a decreased chlorophyll a more in the presence of isolates 1 and 3w. The assessment of alkaline phosphatase activity showed decreased activity in both cyanobacterial isolates exposed to the bacteria, relative to the untreated control sample. Microscopy analysis through fluorescence indicated that the attachment of the bacteria to the surface of the cyanobacteria hampered with the fluorescence and scanning electron microscopy indicated that the cells were damaged by the addition of the bacterial isolates. Cyanotoxin detection through the ELISA kit testing indicated that there was toxin reduction in samples treated with the bacterial isolates, with the highest reduction being close to 60% in the case of Microcystis sp. treated with isolate 3w. Similar reductions were noted in the filamentous cyanobacterium Oscillatoria, in the presence of isolate 1.

AB The mycotoxin zearalenone (ZEA) has strong estrogenic effects and elicits reproductive toxicity. Chrysin is a natural flavonoid found in many plant and has a broad range of pharmacological activities, including anticancer, antioxidant and anti-inflammatory. The present study aimed to investigate the potential protective effects of chrysin against ZEA toxicity. Mice received chrysin (5 or 20 mg/kg; i.g.) for ten days, and then received a single injection of ZEA (40 mg/kg). Two days thereafter, blood and testes were collected. ZEA decreased number and motility of sperm, plasma testosterone levels, enzymatic (glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase, glutathione-S-transferase) and non-enzimatic defenses (reduced glutathione). Moreover, ZEA increased 4-hydroxynonenal and 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine levels, myeloperoxidase activity and levels of proinflammatory cytokines (interleukins-1 beta and 6, tumor necrosis factor alpha). ZEA also decreased levels of anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-10 and increased activity of caspases 3 and 9. Chrysin treatment increased the number and motility of sperm, testosterone levels, restored antioxidant defenses and reduced the inflammation and apoptosis process. In summary, chrysin attenuated the toxic effects caused by ZEA in blood and testes of mice, suggesting a potential preventive treatment against the deleterious effects of ZEA.

AB A novel snake venom cysteine-rich secretory protein (svCRiSP), Hellerin, was purified from C. o. helleri venom using sequential reverse phase and cation-exchange chromatography. Gel electrophoresis, N-terminal sequencing, and LC-MS/MS sequencing identified a single protein with a molecular mass of approximately 24.8 kDa and confirmed its identity as a svCRiSP. Hellerin had cytotoxic effects on human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) in a dose-dependent manner but not in human dermal lymphatic endothelial cells (HDLECs) and human dermal blood endothelial cells (HDBECs). Hellerin produced a dramatic increase in both blood vascular permeability in vivo, and in the trans-epithelial permeability of cultured HDLEC and HDBEC cells. This is the first study that describes the effect of a svCRiSP on vascular, blood and lymphatic permeability.

AB Larkspur (Delphinium spp.) poisoning is a long-term problem for cattle grazing on rangelands of western North America. Recent research has shown that both plant and animal-based factors are critical in understanding and mitigating larkspur poisoning in cattle. Non-toxicological factors including sex, age, cattle breed, and plant chemotype affect cattle responses to larkspur. For example, Angus heifers are more susceptible to larkspur intoxication than are steers or bulls. Young cattle appear to be more susceptible to larkspur poisoning than mature animals. Beef breeds of cattle are more susceptible to larkspur intoxication than dairy breeds. In addition to animal factors, plant alkaloid composition (chemotype) affects the potential toxicity for cattle because of differences in the ratios and concentrations of highly toxic N-(methylsuccinimido) anthranoyllycoctonine (MSAL)-type alkaloids compared to less lethal non-MSAL-type alkaloids. Animal- and plant-based factors can provide substantial information to inform livestock producers on management to reduce risk and cattle losses to various larkspur species in western North America.

AB The hump-nosed pit viper Hypnale hypnale is responsible for a high number of snakebite cases in southwestern India and Sri Lanka. Although most patients only develop local signs and symptoms of envenoming, there is a growing body of evidence indicating that these envenomings may be associated with systemic alterations, including acute kidney injury. In this study we evaluated the renal toxicity of H. hypnale venom by using a perfused isolated rat kidney system and by assessing cytotoxicity in two different renal tubular cell lines in culture. The venom caused alterations in several renal functional parameters, such as reduction on perfusion pressure, renal vascular resistance, and sodium and chloride tubular transport, whereas glomerular filtration rate and urinary flow initially decreased and then increased after venom perfusion. In addition, this venom was cytotoxic to proximal and distal renal tubular cells in culture, with predominance of necrosis over apoptosis. Moreover, the venom affected the mitochondrial membrane potential and induced an increment in reactive oxygen species in these cells. Taken together, our results demonstrate a nephrotoxic activity of H. hypnale venom in these experimental models, in agreement with clinical observations.

AB Few studies have reported quantitative data about the levels of prenylated coumarins in Ferula sp. Yet, the toxicity of Ferula sp. is only due to the presence of prenylated coumarins and to their concentrations and all studies suggest the existence of several chemotypes within the same species or even within the same variety. The aim of this study was to investigate the hypothesis of different chemotypes in french Ferula sp. in relationship with the botanical species. In this objective, the species of giant fennels and their concentrations in prenylated coumarins were explored. Three different species or subspecies of giant fennel were detected in continental France: F. communis communis communis L., F. communis catalaunica microcarpa Cauwet-Marc and F. glauca L. Surprisingly, the three species/subspecies of giant fennels were found to be located in exclusive and well separated geographical areas. In French giant fennels, ferulenol and ferprenin were detected. Distribution of ferulenol and ferprenin were found to be different between botanical varieties, but also according to the season, the soil and the altitude. Our study seems to suggest that among F. communis species, the same plant can be regarded as poisonous at one point and another as non-poisonous.

AB The aim of this study was to investigate the clinical, biochemical and toxicological findings of the experimentally poisoning induced by Heterophyllaea pustulata in goats. Ten healthy adult female Saanen breed goats were used in the experiment. The goats were randomly assigned to two groups of five individuals: control and experimental group (CG and EG). Both groups were kept in the same enclosure devoid of shade for 8 h daily. The EG received only H. pustulata samples (leaves and thin steam) and water ad libitum. The CG received lucerne hay. Blood samples were taken at different times after oral administration of vegetal samples, and level of hepatic enzymes, total bilirubin, conjugated and non-conjugated bilirubin was measured, together with the detection of anthraquinones (AQs) and phylloerythrin by High Performance Liquid Chromatography with Diode-Array Detector and Mass Spectrometry with Electron Spray Ionization and Quadrupole Time Of Fly analysis. At the same time, skin biopsy samples were collected for AQs determinations. For histopathological examination, hepatic biopsy samples were collected on day 8. Clinically, all goats of the EG revealed photophobia, dermatitis and photosensitization. None of these goats developed jaundice or died during the experiment (15 days). In addition, affected goats exhibited a significant elevation in the serum levels of glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase, direct bilirubin, and total bilirubin. Microscopic examination of the liver samples revealed slight degenerative lesions. Although phylloerythrin was not detected in sera, a high level of two predominant AQs in H. pustulata (rubiadin/soranjidiol) were noted between 24 and 72 h after plant consumption, which coincided with the period in which the clinical signs were more obvious. Since those AQs were not identified in skin samples, the clinical findings were supported by the presence of AQs in sera. Finally, toxicological studies of the AQs are important, since many current works suggest their potential use in the photodynamic therapy.

ID AUREUS; ELISA; ASSAY
AB Staphylococcal enterotoxin B (SEB) is an important enterotoxin which is a major reason for food poisoning and a potential biologic agent. Hence, rapid and accurate detection is very important. An amplified luminescent proximity homogeneous assay (AlphaLISA) for SEB detection was established here. Its performance was evaluated on mock specimen and culture supernatant. Its free from the effect of protein A was compared with ELISA. Results showed that the linear range for SEB detection was 25 pg/mL to 25 ng/mL. The detection limitation is 25 pg/mL in buffer and 50 pg/mL in specimen respectively. There was no cross-reaction with other classical SEs or botulinum toxin. AlphaLISA was also tolerant to the matrix of sample and showed good repeatability. The inter-assay coefficient of variation (CV) and intra-assay CV were < 10% for buffer and mock specimens, respectively. Besides AlphaLISA detection was free of the interference of protein A (which is the obstacle for immune-based detection of SEs in Staphylococcus aureus culture supernatants): this feature is very important for food-poisoning confirmation caused by SEB contamination. These data suggest that the AlphaLISA established here is well suited for SEB detection in food samples and S. aureus culture supernatants.

AB In recent years, there is a growing interest in new medical applications of botulinum toxin, including pain control, osteoarthritis treatment, and wound healing. While clinical applications of botulinum toxin seem promising, existing evidence regarding the therapeutic effects is still inadequate. The aim was to assess the efficacy of a single injection of abobotulinumtoxin A into the knee joint cavity to reduce pain in elderly people. We carried out a single group clinical trial in a University Hospital. Thirty participants (24 women) more than 50 years of age with knee osteoarthritis were included. Diagnosis of osteoarthritis was based on clinical and radiologic findings. We gave a single injection containing 250 units of Dysport (= 100 units of botulinum neurotoxin type A) diluted with 5 ml of normal saline. The primary outcome measure was knee pain. The secondary outcome was the patients' opinion about their knee and associated problems measured with the Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score. The outcomes were measured at the baseline and at 4 weeks after the intervention. Within-group comparisons based on the Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Scores showed favorable results for joint pain and stiffness, sports, severity of symptoms, quality of life, and daily activities (all p-values < 0.001). Also, pain intensity, joint effusion, knee clicking and locking, and flexion-extension scores showed significant beneficial results (all p-values <= 0.005). We concluded that botulinum neurotoxin type A is an effective and safe initial treatment of knee osteoarthritis with clear clinical advantages. Patients' satisfaction, minimum adverse effects in addition to single-dose prescription make the toxin as a choice for the first-line therapy of osteoarthritis at least at the short-term in elderly people. The symptom relief increases the patient's compliance and willing to participate in other therapeutic programs.

AB The cutaneous wound healing property of a pro-angiogenic venom peptide (RVVAP) in a cream-based formulation was evaluated using the excision wound healing model on Wistar strain rats. The wound healing potency and modest antibacterial activity of RVVAP was enhanced significantly (p < 0.05) when combined with Aloe vera extract. RVVAP was also found to be non-toxic at the tested dose of 1.0 mg/kg. Nevertheless, the release of inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1, IL-6, IL-10, and TNF-alpha in RVVAP-treated mice was suppressed, compared to the untreated controls. This is the first report assessing the wound healing potential of a low-molecular mass, non-enzymatic, pro-angiogenic peptide purified from snake venom.

   HISTOLOGY
AB Lymphocytes are involved in the adaptive immune response and are highly sensitive to type B trichothecenes. In grains and their products, deoxynivalenol (DON) is the most widely distributed trichothecene. It usually co-occurs with other type B members, such as nivalenol (NIV) and fusarenon-X (FX), because they are all produced by the same Fusarium fungi. However, the combined effects of mycotoxins are complex and cannot be predicted based on individual toxicity. Thus, the adverse effects of combined toxins are of increasing concern. The aim of this study was to compare the toxicity to lymphoid tissues of mice of DON alone or mixed with NIV or FX. Forty, 3-week-old male ICR mice were given a single oral administration of a vehicle control, one toxin, binary, or ternary mixtures and then sacrificed at 12 h after exposure. Mice treated with FX alone showed marked nuclear condensation and fragmentation of lymphocytes in the cortical thymus and germinal center of Peyer's patches and spleen. Similarly, these animals clearly displayed TUNEL- and Caspase-3-positive cells in the regions. In contrast, minimal changes were noticed in the lymphoid tissues of mice receiving combined toxins when compared to this toxin alone. In addition, oral exposure to FX alone significantly up-regulated the relative expression of Bax, Caspase-3, Caspase-9, and Trp53. These data increase our understanding of the toxic actions of DON, NIV, and FX alone or in combination to lymphocytes and can be used to assess the possible risk associated with their co-occurrences in foodstuffs to human and animal health.

AB The ShKT superfamily is widely distributed throughout nature and encompasses a wide range of documented functions and processes, from modulation of potassium channels to involvement in morphogenesis pathways. Cysteine-rich secretory proteins (CRISPs) contain a cysteine-rich domain (CRD) at the C-terminus that is similar in structure to the ShK fold. Despite the structural similarity of the CRD and ShK-like domains, we know little of the sequence-function relationships in these families. Here, for the first time, we examine the evolution of the biophysical properties of sequences within the ShKT superfamily in relation to function, with a focus on the ShK-like superfamily. ShKT data were sourced from published sequences in the protein family database, in addition to new ShK-like sequences from the Australian speckled anemone (Oulactis sp.). Our analysis clearly delineates the ShK-like family from the CRDs of CRISP proteins. The four CRISP subclusters separate out into the main phyla of Mammalia, Insecta and Reptilia. The ShK-like family is in turn composed of seven subclusters, the largest of which contains members from across the eukaryotes, with a continuum of intermediate properties. Smaller sub-clusters contain specialised members such as nematode ShK-like sequences. Several of these ShKT sub-clusters contain no functionally characterised sequences. This chemical space analysis should be useful as a guide to select sequences for functional studies and to gain insight into the evolution of these highly divergent sequences with an ancient conserved fold.

AB Tetrodotoxin (TTX) is a neurotoxin mainly responsible for severe neurological illness, and okadaic acid (OA) is another important lipophilic toxin to humans. In this study, we developed a gold strip for simultaneous detection of OA and TTX in real seafood samples. In the assay, the prepared nanoparticles (about 40 nm) was applied to conjugate with specific monoclonal antibodies against OA and TTX, and the resulted mixtures were used to capture its corresponding toxin in test strip. OA and TTX conjugates were coated as two test lines on the nitrocellulose membrane, and goat anti-mouse IgG was used to form the control line, forming three lines on the test strip. The visual detection limits (vLOD) of this immunoassay for OA and TTX were 0.75 and 15 ng/mL, respectively, and no cross reactions were observed in the process of detection. The visual assay for OA and TTX detection could be finished within 10 min. This study might provide a feasible method and good understanding for rapidly simultaneous detection for toxins based on immunoassay.

AB Background: Cytotoxin 1 (CTX1) purified from Naja atra Cantor venom could inhibit cancer cell proliferation, but the mechanism is not clear. This study aimed to investigate the mechanism by which leukemia cells are killed by CTX1.
   Materials and methods: HL-60 and KG1 a cells were treated with CTX1 and the cell death was detected.
   Results: The viability of HL-60 and KG1 a cells decreased in a dose- and time-dependent manner after treatment with CTX1. CTX1 mainly induced late apoptosis and necrosis. The cell death induced by CTX1 could be rescued by specific necroptosis inhibitor Nec-1 but not by caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-fmk in HL-60 cells. In addition, CTX1 increased lysosome membrane permeability (LMP) and release of cathepsin B.
   Conclusion: CTX1 could induce necroptosis in leukemia cells, and it is related to LMP increase and cathepsin release. CTX1 could be a promising anti-cancer drug for leukemia therapy.

ID ASPARAGINE SYNTHETASE DEFICIENCY; SWISS-MODEL
AB BACKGROUND: Congenital microcephaly could result from a gene mutation. Asparagine synthetase deficiency, which is caused by the asparagine synthetase (ASNS) mutation, is a rare autosomal-recessive neurometabolic disorder. It is characterized by severe developmental delay, congenital microcephaly, and seizures.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: Here we present the first report on a progressive intracerebral cyst associated with ASNS mutation, which caused neurodevelopmental dysplasia. ASNS mutation was confirmed by whole-exome sequencing and is the most likely reason for the neurodevelopmental dysplasia, which results in microcephaly, refractory seizures, and congenital visual impairment. Antiepileptic drugs have limited therapeutic effect on these epileptic seizures.
   CONCLUSIONS: Although there is no cure for this disorder so far, the huge progressive intracerebral cyst can be cured by a cyst-peritoneal shunt.

TI Improvement of Writer's Cramp from an Old Lesion in the Contralateral
   Hemisphere with Transient Gait Disturbance After Thalamotomy

   Ventro-oral nucleus; Writer's cramp
ID DYSTONIA; HEMIPARESIS
AB BACKGROUND: Stereotactic ventro-oral thalamotomy has been performed in cases of focal task-specific dystonia, including writer's cramp, with excellent outcomes. However, no reports have revealed the outcome of ventro-oral thalamotomy in a patient with a contralateral cerebral lesion. We describe a patient with left-hand writer's cramp with an old lesion in the left hemisphere and transient gait disturbance after right ventro-oral thalamotomy.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 43-year-old man had a hemorrhage in the left basal ganglia due to cerebral arteriovenous malformation at 22 years of age, and right hemiparesis remained as a sequela. He developed left-handed writing ability; however, he became aware of the stiffness of his left hand and difficulty in writing. Writer's cramp was diagnosed. Medical treatments were not effective, and right ventro-oral thalamotomy was performed. Although his writing ability improved, he could not walk. After performing rehabilitation, his walking completely improved, reaching the level before surgery, after 3 months, and his writer's cramp was completely cured.
   CONCLUSIONS: In patients with basal nucleus lesions, gait disturbance may appear transiently after contralateral thalamotomy. It is crucial to fully explain the potential complications, particularly in relation to temporal gait disturbances, and obtain informed consent.

TI Ganglioglioma with Cerebrospinal Fluid Rhinorrhea: A Rare Presentation
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
LA English
DT Article
DE CSF rhinorrhea; Erosion; Ganglioglioma; Seizures
ID TUMOR RECURRENCE; PROGRESSION
AB BACKGROUND: Gangliogliomas are low-grade gliomas, and patients generally present with seizures. Gangliogliomas commonly occur in the temporal lobe and predominantly occur in children. Malignant progression is rare.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 26-year-old woman presented with a history of seizures since childhood and cerebrospinal fluid rhinorrhea for the past 6 months. Generally, patients with gangliogliomas seek early medical attention, as they present with dramatic complex partial seizures. This patient experienced seizures for 10 years and never sought medical attention during this time. She did not present for medical evaluation until she developed cerebrospinal fluid rhinorrhea.
   CONCLUSIONS: This case gave us an opportunity to learn the natural history ganglioglioma, although clinical presentations vary according to tumor location. This is the first case report to our knowledge of a patient with ganglioglioma presenting with cerebrospinal fluid rhinorrhea.

   Malignant intraspinal dermoid; Malignant transformation; Spinal benign
   cystic teratoma; Spinal mature teratoma
ID MATURE CYSTIC TERATOMA; NEURAL-TUBE; CLOSURE
AB BACKGROUND: Intraspinal dermoid tumors are usually rare benign growths that occur as a result of defects during neural tube formation. They make up less than 1% of tumors in the spine and are associated with spinal dysraphisms or sinus tracts. Although rare, malignant transformation into squamous cell carcinoma has been previously reported. Malignant transformation into adenocarcinoma, however, represents a novel phenotypic differentiation pattern that is hitherto undescribed.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 45-year-old woman presented with acute symptoms of equina syndrome. Imaging of the spine revealed a large intradural sacral mass. The lesion was surgically resected with pathology revealing a dermoid tumor with malignant transformation into adenocarcinoma. Metastatic workup revealed no other suspicious lesions. The patient had an uneventful postoperative course, gradually regaining micturition control.
   CONCLUSIONS: Dermoid tumors, also known as benign cystic teratoma or mature teratoma, are usually benign congenital tumors comprising epithelial cells that arise from displaced embryonic ectoderm and mesoderm during neural tube formation. Although extremely rare, malignant transformation into squamous cell carcinoma has been reported. This case represents the first report of an intraspinal dermoid tumor transforming into adenocarcinoma. A comprehensive histopathologic analysis is key to identifying the lesion and guiding postsurgical management.

DT Article
DE Epidural hematoma; Soccer; Sport-related structural brain injury
ID ACUTE SUBDURAL-HEMATOMA; ARACHNOID CYST; 2ND IMPACT; PLAYER; CONCUSSION
AB BACKGROUND: Sports-related structural brain injury (SRSBI) is a rare, but potentially catastrophic, injury. Limited data exist outlining its epidemiology, pathophysiology, and outcomes. We have presented a case of an epidural hematoma (EDH) that occurred during a high school soccer game.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 16-year-old boy had experienced a head-to-ball collision and head-to-head collision with another player. He denied loss of consciousness, endorsed retrograde amnesia, and complained of a minor headache. On the sidelines, he subsequently passed brief orientation and physical exertion tests. However, on returning to play, he experienced blurry vision, along with headache and nausea/vomiting. At the local hospital, he was found to have a 2.6-cm right frontal EDH. After transfer to our institution, increasing somnolence was noted, prompting emergent evacuation of the EDH. His postoperative course was unremarkable, and he was discharged on postoperative day 2. At the 2-week and 3-month follow-up visits, he did not express any complaints or residual deficits and was cleared for full sporting activity.
   CONCLUSIONS: The present case highlights one of the few SRSBIs that have, occurred in soccer. Because of their rarity and severity, a concerted effort should be made to report these cases of SRSBIs regarding the mechanism, postcollision symptoms, and long-term outcomes.

   ACCURACY; KYPHOSIS
AB BACKGROUND: Cervical tuberculosis accounts for only 4.2%-12% of the total incidence of spinal tuberculosis cases. Although antituberculosis drugs have been the mainstay treatment of cervical tuberculosis, they have been ineffective against the symptoms of existing spinal deformities and spinal cord compression, which often require surgical intervention. The conventional surgical methods have been anterior debridement and titanium mesh, cage bone graft fusion and internal fixation. However, all have certain deficiencies regarding the stability of fixation.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: We have presented the case of a 41-year-old Chinese man who had been experiencing neck pain and stiffness for 1 month. The symptoms had been accompanied by low-grade fever and repeated night sweats. The purified protein derivative test result was positive and the antituberculosis test result was negative. Imaging examination showed destruction of the C5 and C6 vertebral bodies and C5 andC6 intervertebral discs, with an intensive abscess at the C5-C6 vertebral level. After 3-dimensional printing-assisted anterior debridement and artificial vertebral body replacement, his preoperative symptoms of neck pain and stiffness had been alleviated. Also, his symptoms of numbness in both upper limbs had disappeared completely. At the last follow-up examination, he had recovered well and the tuberculosis focus had been completely cured.
   CONCLUSION: To the best of our knowledge, we have reported the first clinical application of 3-dimensional printing-assisted cervical anterior bilateral pedicle screw fixation of an artificial vertebral body. We accomplished ultrashort segment fixation, with excellent clinical outcomes obtained, which were maintained at the recent 2-year follow-up examination.

AB BACKGROUND: Although reoperation likely confers survival benefit for glioblastoma, whether the extent of resection (EOR) of the reoperation affects survival outcome has yet to be thoroughly evaluated in the current temozolomide (TMZ) era. The aim of this meta-analysis was to pool the current literature and evaluate the prognostic significance of reoperation EOR for glioblastoma recurrence in the current TMZ era.
   METHODS: Searches of 7 electronic databases from inception to January 2019 were conducted following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. There were 1203 articles identified for screening. Prognostic hazard ratios (HRs) for overall survival (OS) derived from multivariate regression analysis were analyzed using meta-analysis of proportions.
   RESULTS: Nine individual studies satisfied all selection criteria, describing survival in 1507 patients with glioblastoma, including 1335 reoperations for recurrence (89%). When studies incorporated the EOR of index surgery into their analysis, maximal resection at reoperation was significantly prognostic for longer OS (HR, 0.59; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.43-0.79; I-2 = 0%; P heterogeneity <0.01). When studies did not incorporate the EOR of index surgery into their analysis, maximal resection remained significantly prognostic for longer OS at reoperation (HR, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.45-0.64; I-2 = 5.2%; P heterogeneity <0.01). Based on EOR, radiographic gross total resection (GTR) was the most prognostic EOR definition at reoperation (HR, 0.52; 95% CI, 0.44-0.61; I-2 = 0%; P heterogeneity <0.01).
   CONCLUSIONS: In the current TMZ era, when reoperation is feasible for recurrent glioblastoma, maximal safe resection appears to confer a significant OS benefit based on the current literature. This benefit is most pronounced with radiographic GTR, and likely irrespective of EOR at index surgery.

ID EN-BLOC SPONDYLECTOMY; CERVICAL-SPINE; BONE; SYSTEM
AB OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the quantitative, radiologic, morphologic, and histo-logic effects of neoadjuvant denosumab treatment (DT) on 4 patients with spinal giant cell tumor of bone (GCTB) and determine the tumor shrinkage effects of DT for spinal GCTB.
   METHODS: The morphologic changes in the 4 patients with spinal GCTB who underwent total spondylectomy after neoadjuvant DT at our institution were retrospectively analyzed using computed tomography. Osteolytic tumor volume, vertebral body height, maximum anterior and transverse diameter, and mean area of the spinal canal occupied by the tumor were evaluated.
   RESULTS: In all patients, osteolytic tumor volume decreased by 81.2% and vertebral body height decreased by 87.4% on average following DT. In 3 of 4 patients with osteolytic lesions and a thin cortical rim, vertebral collapse had progressed after DT. Conversely, vertebral collapse was not observed in one patient with adequate anterior cortical bone. Two patients showed a mean decrease of 96.7% in the maximum transverse diameter, whereas 2 had a mean increase of 109% due to vertebral collapse. The mean area of the spinal canal occupied by the tumor reduced from 56.1% to 15.1%.
   CONCLUSIONS: In all patients, osteolytic tumor volume decreased after DT. This tumor shrinkage effect of DT may increase the mechanical stress on the thin cortical rim, leading to the acute collapse of the affected vertebral body if it consists mostly of osteolytic lesions. The presence of adequate anterior cortical bone could prevent acute vertebral collapse after DT.

TI Case Report of Rarely Described Polymorphous Low-Grade Neuroepithelial
   Tumor of the Young and Comparison with Oligodendroglioma
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
LA English
DT Article
DE Dysembryoplastic; Neoplasm; Neurosurgery; Oligodendroglioma; PLNTY;
   Polymorphous low-grade neuroepithelial tumor of the young; Seizure
AB BACKGROUND: Polymorphous low-grade neuroepithelial tumor of the young (PLANY) is a central nervous system tumor that shares many qualities with oligodendroglioma but is rarely and only very recently described as a distinct entity in the literature.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A previously healthy, 19-year-old man presented with new onset of seizures. Imaging showed an intracranial mass, which was treated with surgical removal. Preoperative and postoperative magnetic resonance imaging, histopathologic examination, genetic testing, and immunohistochemical staining all supported a diagnosis of PLNTY.
   CONCLUSIONS: Diagnostic investigation of PLNTY shows many similarities with oligodendroglioma, and thus these entities can be mistaken for one another. Certain studies are needed to distinguish PLNTY and other dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumors, such as oligodendroglioma.

TI Vision Outcomes in Early versus Late Surgical Intervention of Pituitary
   Apoplexy: Meta-Analysis
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
LA English
DT Review
DE Meta-analysis; Neurosurgery; Pituitary apoplexy; Timing; Vision
ID CONSERVATIVE MANAGEMENT; SURGERY; EXPERIENCE; ADENOMAS
AB BACKGROUND: Pituitary apoplexy (PA) is defined by hemorrhage and ne-crosis of the pituitary gland, often acute in onset, and frequently in the setting of an existing pituitary adenoma. Our objective was to conduct a meta-analysis of the available literature on vision outcomes following surgical intervention for PA on the basis of the timing from apoplexy to surgery (ATS).
   METHODS: A thorough literature search of the published English-language literature was performed in PubMed, Ovid, and Cochrane databases using the key words ("pituitary apoplexy") and ("surgery" or "vision") from database inception to August 2018 was conducted. The primary outcome variable evaluated using a binary random-effects model was vision recovery outcomes (metric: odds ratio).
   RESULTS: Of 234 articles found, 12 articles containing 200 patients met our eligibility criteria. The mean age was 46.1, with a male-to-female ratio of 2.9:1. A total of 86% of PA patients presented with visual deficits (ATS <7 days in 93 and >7 days in 79 patients). In patients with an ATS <7 days, 97.8% experienced visual recovery, compared with 84.8% with an ATS >7 days (odds ratio 2.6 [95% CI 0.94-7.31]; P value = 0.07).
   CONCLUSIONS: Despite readily accepted guidelines provided by the United Kingdom advocating for early surgical intervention in PA, the rates of vision outcomes we report demonstrate >80% recovery for patients in both the early and late surgical intervention group. As such, conservative management may be warranted for early stabilization before surgical intervention in PA patients with respect to vision outcomes.

TI Newly Diagnosed Optic Pathway Glioma During Pregnancy
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
LA English
DT Article
DE Optic pathway glioma; Pilocytic astrocytoma; Pregnancy
ID NERVE GLIOMA
AB BACKGROUND: Optic pathway gliomas (OPGs) are relatively rare, and their presentation after the first decade of life is even less common. Although many treatment options exist, surgery is typically reserved for tumors significantly compressing surrounding structures. Pregnancy can complicate the management of these tumors, as fetal developmental considerations limit the ways in which they are imaged and treated.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: In this report we detail the case of a 27-year-old pregnant woman who was found to have an OPG during her third trimester. After a decline in this patient's vision and clinical status, a decision was made to induce labor at 31 weeks so that her disease could be more thoroughly addressed.
   CONCLUSIONS: While OPGs are typically benign tumors, pregnancy complicates their management significantly. Contrast media and anesthesia pose significant risks to the fetus, while pregnancy may contribute to increased rates of tumor growth and clinical deterioration. Managing OPGs in pregnant patients thus requires balancing the risks to the fetus and patient.

TI Evaluation of a Novel Surgical Skills Training Course: Are Cadavers
   Still the Gold Standard for Surgical Skills Training?
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY

DT Article
DE High-fidelity training models; Residency education; Surgical education;
   Training models
ID ANATOMY EDUCATION; SIMULATION; MODEL; CURRICULUM; KNOWLEDGE
AB BACKGROUND: An increasing body of literature describing use of high-fidelity surgical training models is challenging long-held dogma that cadavers provide the best medium for postgraduate surgical skills training. The purpose of this study was to describe a surgical skills course comprising entirely synthetic training models developed by resident and attending neurosurgeons and to evaluate their perceptions of the overall usefulness of this course and its usefulness compared with cadaveric courses.
   METHODS: Ten high-fidelity neurosurgical training models were developed. A neurosurgical skills course for residents was structured to include 7 spinal and 3 cranial learning stations, each with its own model and assigned attending expert. Resident and attending neurosurgeons were asked to complete surveys on their overall impressions of the course and models and on workload comparisons between models and real cases. Student t tests were used for statistical comparisons.
   RESULTS: Survey responses were collected from 9 of 16 participating residents (56.3%) and 3 of 10 attending neurosurgeons (30.0%). Both groups believed that the course was very helpful overall to resident education. Respondents furthermore believed that the course was more helpful overall than cadaveric courses. Task load index testing showed no significant workload difference between models and real cases (P >= 0.17), except in temporal demand (P < 0.001).
   CONCLUSIONS: Resident and attending neurosurgeons subjectively believe that high-fidelity synthetic models were superior to cadavers as a surgical skills teaching platform. This study raises the question of whether cadavers should remain the gold standard for surgical skills courses. Expanded use of these teaching models and further study are warranted.

AB BACKGROUND: Pseudoaneurysms (PAs) of the extracranial vertebral artery (VA) are rare lesions, representing less than 1% of all aneurysms. Although these lesions may resolve spontaneously, they present a high rupture rate, so early preventive treatment is advised.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: Case 1: A 48-year-old woman presented with pain and cervical rigidity. An angiotomography showed a PA of the left VA at the level of the C2 transverse foramen, with mural thrombosis and bone remodeling of the left lateral mass. The PA was treated with the endovascular placement of a flow diverter stent. The patient was discharged 3 days after the procedure without complications. The last vascular imaging follow-up was performed 6 years after the procedure showing a patent left VA, with complete resolution of the aneurysm. Case 2: A 57-year-old woman was admitted referring cervicalgia after a polytraumatism. An angiotomography revealed a fracture of the C1 posterior arch, lateral mass, and left transverse foramen, on top of a left VA thrombosis due to a vascular dissection. Eleven months after the trauma, a left VA V3 segment arteriovenous fistula developed. It was treated with hydrocoils, with no complications. One month after the embolization, a left VA V3 segment PA was observed and treated with a flow diverter stent. An angiographic follow-up 2 years after the procedure showed a patent left VA, with complete resolution of the PA.
   CONCLUSION: The use of flow diverters seems to be a safe and effective therapeutic option for the treatment of PAs of the extracranial VAs.

   LESIONS
AB BACKGROUND: Middle meningeal arteriovenous fistula (MM-AVF) is rare; however, it will sometimes be followed by intracranial hemorrhage or progressive symptoms caused by abnormal shunt flow. Radiological examination and endovascular treatment of this condition have recently advanced; thus, we have described the pathogenesis, clinical features, and appropriate diagnostic and therapeutic management of MM-AVF. We also reviewed the reported data of the past 35 years, including 30 cases of MM-AVF.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: We report the case of 24-year-old man who had presented with right tinnitus who had experienced previous head trauma on the opposite side to the tinnitus ear. Time-of-flight magnetic resonance angiography and magnetic resonance arterial spin labeling findings were suggestive of MM-AVF, and catheter angiography confirmed MM-AVF with shunt flow draining into the cavernous sinus. Endovascular transarterial embolization was performed, and the MM-AVF was embolized successfully using detachable coils and n-butyl-2-cyanoacrylate. The tinnitus disappeared completely immediately after the treatment.
   CONCLUSIONS: MM-AVF is caused, not only by coup injury, but also by contrecoup injury. Time-of-flight magnetic resonance angiography and magnetic resonance arterial spin labeling are useful for detecting MM-AVF. Endovascular transarterial embolization is an effective and safe treatment.

ID TARLOV CYSTS; SURGICAL-TREATMENT; MANAGEMENT; PREVALENCE
AB OBJECTIVE: Perineural cysts are a benign spine pathology but, when they become symptomatic and require surgical treatment, represent a significant challenge to the spine surgeon. Here we describe our experience with a novel endoscopic approach to the biopsy, drainage, resection of the cyst wall, and direct cyst fenestration to the subarachnoid space.
   METHODS: A transforaminal endoscopic approach to a lumbar 2-3 perineural cyst is presented here in a 25-year-old patient. A step-by-step technique for the biopsy, drainage, and resection of the cyst wall is presented.
   RESULTS: The patient underwent cyst resection and fenestration into the subarachnoid space without complication, with immediate relief of his preoperative symptoms and after 1 year remains symptom-free.
   CONCLUSIONS: Surgical treatment of perineural cysts in the spine represent a significant challenge to the surgeon, principally due to the risk of spinal fluid leak in the post-operative period. Transforaminal endoscopic surgical access to this disease pathology is a novel minimally invasive surgical approach presented here that allows diagnosis and treatment of a perineural cyst and can be performed in an awake patient.

TI Management of Unique Basilar Invagination Combined with C1 Prolapsing
   into the Foramen Magnum in Children: Report of 2 Cases
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
LA English
DT Article
DE 3D Printed; Atlantoaxial subluxation; Basilar invagination; Congenital
ID ATLANTOAXIAL JOINT DISTRACTION; CRANIOVERTEBRAL JUNCTION; DISLOCATION
AB BACKGROUND: Basilar invagination (BI) is a developmental anomaly and commonly presents with neurologic findings. The incidence of BI associated with other osseous anomalies of the craniovertebral junction is high, including incomplete ring of C1 with spreading of the lateral masses, atlanto-occipital assimilation, hypoplasia of the atlas, basiocciput hypoplasia, and occipital condylar hypoplasia. However, BI combined with C1 prolapsing into the foramen magnum (FM) is an extremely rare condition.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A previously healthy 6-year-old girl (case 1) presented with extremities numbness and left limb weakness over a period of 3 months. Radiograph and computed tomography (CT) scan demonstrated basilar invagination with C1 and dens upward into the FM and C2-3 congenital fusion. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed ventral brainstem and medulla compression, and the medulla-cervical angle was about 100 degrees. The patient underwent transoral anterior decompression, reduction, and fusion by transoral atlantoaxial reduction plate surgery. The symptoms of extremities numbness and limb weakness were all alleviated after surgery. Postoperative MRI showed that the medulla-cervical angle improved from 100 degrees to 143 degrees. An 11-year-old boy (case 2) presented with a 2-month history of limbs numbness and weakness. CT scan and MRI demonstrated BI and compression of the spinal cord, with a crania-spinal angle of only 63 degrees. The 3-dimensional (3D) printed model showed that the anterior arch and lateral of C1 was 90 degrees flipping and vertically upward prolapsing into the FM together with the dens, and the width of the atlas was greater than the maximum diameter of the FM, which resulted in structural incarceration. The patient received posterior occipitocervical fixation and fusion surgery with hyperextension skull traction. Postoperative CT scan revealed the craniospinal angle increased to 102 degrees.
   CONCLUSIONS: We present 2 rare cases of BI combined with C1 prolapsing into the FM. We adopted different surgical strategies with satisfying outcome for these patients. We deem that the treatment of unique BI should be individualized according to the different image characteristics. The image-based modern rapid prototyping and 3D printed techniques can provide invaluable information in presurgical planning for complex craniovertebral junction anomalies.

ID SYNOVIAL CYST
AB BACKGROUND: Extradural benign cysts located in close proximity to the facet joints are called juxtafacetal cysts. Only about 3.5% of such cysts occur in the cervical spine. To our knowledge, there has been no published article on the endoscopic resection of a cervical facet cyst, and this is the first report.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 48-year-old male presented with a chief complaint of severe axial neck pain (visual analog scale score 9) and right scapular pain. The patient had no related radiculopathy or myelopathy, and neurologic status was intact. There was severe limitation of cervical spine movements. Plain radio-graphs indicated age-related degenerative changes with typical features of ankylosing spondylitis with a bamboo spine appearance and gross fusion of all the vertebrae. The only mobile cervical spinal level was C6-C7. Axial magnetic resonance imaging revealed a right-sided juxtafacetal lesion at C6-C7 level that was hyperintense on T2 and hypointense on T1 imaging. A percutaneous endoscopic posterior cervical foraminotomy at right-sided C7-T1 was performed tinder general anesthesia. The cyst was removed, and adequate decompression of the C7 root was achieved. Postoperative magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography scan showed adequate foraminotomy and decompression of the neural structures. The patient had gross relief of neck pain (visual analog scale score 2).
   CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that ankylosing spondylitis may cause formation of a juxtafacetal cyst at the mobile levels in a relatively less mobile cervical spine. The endoscopic resection of such cysts is a minimally invasive novel procedure that can cure such patients successfully without unwanted fusion surgery.

TI Skull Base Chondrosarcoma Caused by Oilier Disease: A Case Report and
   Literature Review
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
LA English
DT Review
DE Intracranial chondrosarcoma; Maffucci syndrome; Oilier disease
ID OLLIERS-DISEASE; MAFFUCCIS-SYNDROME; PATIENT
AB BACKGROUND: Oilier disease (OD) is a rare, nonhereditary bone disease that is characterized by the presence of multiple enchondromatosis (3 or more) with a typical asymmetric distribution which is mainly confined to the appendicular skeleton. OD's most serious complication is the transformation of an enchondroma into chondrosarcoma. The most common sites for chondrosarcoma are in the pelvic and shoulder bones, the superior metaphyseal and diaphyseal regions of the extremities. However, the cranium is an extremely rare site for chondrosarcoma because of OD.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: We report the case of a 27-year-old woman who was admitted to our hospital with paroxysmal headaches over 1 month and left ptosis for 2 weeks. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan revealed a mass was located at the left side of the parasellar area. The mass was surgically removed, and histopathologic examination confirmed chondrosarcoma grade I. During follow-up, more imaging examinations and pathologic examination confirmed the final diagnosis was OD.
   CONCLUSIONS: Intracranial chondrosarcoma caused by OD is extremely rare but should be considered in the differential diagnosis when primary chondrosarcoma is diagnosed. Preoperative diagnosis is challenging, and definitive diagnosis requires immunohistochemical examination and systematic examination of the body. Surgical resection is the most effective therapy for rapid relief of symptoms. For patients with OD with normal intracranial MRI, long-term follow-up is necessary.

ID FACTOR-XI DEFICIENCY; RISK-FACTORS; MANAGEMENT; PATIENT; ARTERY
AB BACKGROUND: Pretruncal nonaneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (PNSAH) accounts for 15%-12% of all case of subarachnoid hemorrhage. Its precise etiology is not yet established. Multiple theories and risk factors have been investigated to address the possible cause of this type of hemorrhage including basilar tip dissecting aneurysms, high spinal arteriovenous fistula, venous stenosis/hypertension or venous bleeding. Hereditary coagulopathies and hemophilias have rarely been reported in the literature as a potential cause of PNSAH.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: Here, we reported a rare case of PNSAH with negative angiogram and magnetic resonance imaging who was also found to have hemophilia C (factor XI deficiency) confirmed by laboratory investigation. We also included a literature review of hereditary coagulopathies and their role as a possible cause of PNSAH.
   CONCLUSIONS: Detailed medical history and physical examination of patients with PNSAH may lead to further hematologic evaluation for this group of patients, as in this case, and may reveal more cases of mild coagulopathy that require treatment.

   Intradural; Thoracic spine
ID TUMOR
AB BACKGROUND: Spinal epidermoid cysts are very rare tumors, especially in thoracic spine; they represent 0.8% of all spinal epidermoids. In adult cases, they are often associated with surgical procedures such as lumbar puncture. We report a rare case of spinal epidermoid cyst in the thoracic spine of an elderly patient who had never undergone lumber puncture, thoracic spinal surgery, or trauma.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 78-year old woman presented with a 1-month history of rapidly progressive impairment of sensation in both the lower limbs, with gait disturbance. She had no history of spinal surgery, trauma, or lumbar puncture. Her past medical history was unremarkable. Magnetic resonance imaging of the whole spine revealed an intraspinalextramedullary tumor at the Th 1 .2 level. Diffusion-weighted imaging revealed significant homogeneous high intensity. We performed complete resection without damaging the spinal cord or nerve roots. The final histological examination indicated epidermoid cyst without malignancy. Her gait disturbance was completely resolved at 4-month follow-up.
   CONCLUSIONS: Epidermoid cysts must be considered among spinal tumors in .rly patients. Early detection by diffusion-weighted imaging and complete resection may lead to good neurological outcome.

DT Article
DE Pseudoaneurysm; Scalp laceration; Superficial temporal artery
ID TRAUMATIC PSEUDOANEURYSM; BRANCH
AB BACKGROUND: Aneurysms of superficial temporal arteries (STAs) are rare. The majority of them are induced by blunt trauma. To our knowledge, a pseudoaneurysm of the STA induced by scalp laceration has never been reported.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 20-year-old man who complained of a pulsatile headache and had a lump on his right temple was admitted to our department. He had a history of frontal scalp laceration 2 weeks before the admission, and physical examination revealed 1 healed scar over the lump. On the basis of the characteristics of the headache and lump, surgical excision was taken and diagnosis was confirmed intraoperatively and by pathologic examination post-operatively. The postoperative course was uneventful.
   CONCLUSIONS: Despite the rarity of pseudoaneurysm of STA after scalp laceration, this case may warrant the potential complication of a pseudoaneurysm, especially if scalp laceration courses over the branches of the STA.

TI Cured from a Cardiac Myxoma? Brain Intraparenchymal Hemorrhage in a

   stroke; Left cardiac myxoma
ID NEUROLOGICAL MANIFESTATIONS; SURGICAL-TREATMENT; EXPERIENCE; SERIES
AB BACKGROUND: A cardiac myxoma (CM) is the most common primary tumor of the heart. This case report highlights that for metastatic CMs, even after a successful total resection, there is a small but real risk of recurrence that can manifest as late as 10 years after initial tumor resection.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: We present the case of a 53-year-old woman who visited the emergency room after a 4-day worsening right-sided weakness. The patient was diagnosed with a left CM 10 years previously, and a complete surgical resection was performed at that time. A noncontrast computed tomography of the head revealed a left parietal hematoma and a contrast computed tomography scan of the head revealed an enlarged left parieto-occipital vein that was subsequently shown to be part of an arteriovenous fistula. After embolization of the fistula was performed, postprocedure magnetic resonance imaging of the brain showed redemonstration of acute intra-parenchymal hemorrhage with vasogenic edema. The history of a previously resected CM and the multifocal distribution of brain lesions opened the possibility of slow-growing metastasis from the previous myxoma.
   CONCLUSIONS: Our case report demonstrates the metastatic nature of CMs to the central nervous system, even after successful gross total resection and no local relapsing mass in subsequent ultrasonographic follow-ups. A comprehensive evaluation on clinical and imagological grounds is mandatory to rule out the presence of myxomatous metastatic disease. Awareness and recognition of the potential neurologic manifestations of a metastatic CM will prevent unnecessary diagnostic workup and treatments.

ID TERATOMA SYNDROME; MALFORMATION
AB BACKGROUND: A 26-year-old man was admitted with complaints of progressive depressive mood and general fatigue. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed diffuse enhanced lesions in the neurohypophyseal, pineal, and paraventricular regions and ventricular wall.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: Endoscopic biopsy confirmed the presence of germ cell tumor and chemoradiation therapy (CRT) was then performed. Most of the tumors disappeared after CRT except for the right paraventricular lesion. Follow-up magnetic resonance imaging performed 14 months after CRT showed enlargement of this residual lesion. In addition to tumor growth, coexistent flow void signals within the tumor increased. Angiographically, this vascular lesion mimicked arteriovenous malformation, which was mainly fed by the lenticulostriate artery and drained into the internal cerebral vein. Transarterial embolization was performed, resulting in effective flow reduction. Subsequently, the tumor was resected without complications. It was histopathologically diagnosed as a mature teratoma with an arteriovenous fistula (AVF). Arterial components were observed to directly connect to venous components within the tumor without any intermediate nidal components.
   CONCLUSIONS: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported case of an intracranial germ cell tumor coexistent with a growing AVF. AVF developed within a CRT-refractory teratomatous component, which was successfully treated with embolization followed by surgical resection.

AB OBJECTIVE: To investigate the clinical effect and surgical techniques of fourth ventricle astrocytoma resection through the median suboccipital keyhole approach.
   METHODS: Twelve patients received tumor resection -.Alga the median suboccipital keyhole approach in our department A 4-cm median suboccipital excision starting 1 cm under the foramen magnum region and directed vertically upward was applied. The fourth ventricle was exposed through a cerebellomedullary fissure approach within a bone hole approximate to 2.5 cm in diameter. All clinical data (including preoperative/postoperative symptoms, magnetic resonance imaging scan, intraoperative findings, tumor resection rate, and surgical complications) were collected and analyzed.
   RESULTS: In our treatment group, the mean maximum tumor diameter was 3.48 +/- 1.3 cm and the mean tumor volume was 34.79 +/- 20.70 cm(3) The complete resection rate was 92%. The average operative blood loss was 127.0 +/- 24.6 mL; the mean craniotomy time was 26.4 +/- 6.0 minutes; the mean tumor resection time was 190.3 +/- 31.2 minutes; the mean cranial closure time was 42.3 +/- 6.1 minutes; and the average hospitalization time was 13.6 +/- 2.4 days. The mean Glasgow Outcome Scale score before discharge was 4.92.
   CONCLUSIONS: If appropriate microneurosurgical techniques are used via the median suboccipital keyhole approach, the fourth ventricle astrocytoma may be accessed and resected safely with shorter surgery time, reduced hemorrhage during operation, low incidence of postoperative complications, good recovery, and shorter hospitalization time.

TI Modified Endoscopic Diving Technique without the Traditional Irrigation
   System in Endoscopic Cranial Base Surgery: Technical Note
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
LA English
DT Article
DE Cranial base surgery; Diving technique; Endoscopic surgery; Neurosurgery
AB BACKGROUND: We describe a modified endoscopic diving technique with an alternative irrigation system different than the one used by Locatelli et al. (CLEARVISION II, Karl Storz and Co., Tuttlingen, Germany).
   METHODS: From January 2016 to October 2018, our senior surgeon performed the modified endoscopic diving technique in 76 endoscopic surgical procedures. Diving surgery was performed in all procedures to check the completeness of tumor resection, thus allowing for the removal of any residual tumor tissue.
   RESULTS: In the modified endoscopic diving technique, the optic system and the irrigation source are separated into 2 independent tools, allowing surgeons to point the flow on a selected structure, whereas the endoscope can be pointed in the same direction or not. Moreover, the optic system and the irrigation source can be placed at different distances. Surgeons can control the infusion pressure and the entity of the flow.
   CONCLUSIONS: The use of the modified endoscopic --mg technique allows surgeons to have more settings that could be controlled and also bypasses any compatibility issues between different endoscopic systems. In addition, the reproducibility of this technique, together with the low cost of the instrumentation, could allow an easier application of the diving technique.

TI Meningioma Presenting with Spontaneous Subdural Hematoma: A Report of
   Two Cases and Literature Review

ID HEMORRHAGE; PATIENT; TUMORS; BRAIN
AB BACKGROUND: Although meningiomas are considered benign, encapsulated brain tumors, their distinct intracranial location can lead to devastating complications. Although a highly vascularized tumor, a rarely reported complication of meningioma is hemorrhage. To the best of our knowledge, only 19 cases of meningioma presenting with a subdural hematoma have been reported.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: We have outlined the clinical presentation, radiological findings, and outcomes of 2 female patients with a diagnosis of a spontaneous subdural hematoma associated with meningioma. The coagulation profile was within normal limits for both patients. The postoperative histopathologic examination results showed an angiomatous/microcystic subtype of meningioma (patient 1) and meningothelial meningioma (patient 2). Both patients underwent right frontal craniotomy, resection of the dural-based tumor, and evacuation of the subdural hematoma.
   CONCLUSIONS: We comprehensively reviewed the pertinent data for mediomas presenting as subdural hematomas. The mechanism of hemorrhage in meningiomas remains unclear. Therefore, further studies are required to investigate the possible mechanisms of bleeding in such tumors.

AB BACKGROUND: Tumors protruding into the cerebral aqueduct are rare, and tumors arising from within the cerebral aqueduct are rarer still.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: In this report, we discuss the presentation and clinical outcome of a 65-year-old man who presented to us with symptoms of hydrocephalus. Prior imaging had revealed a small enhancing nodule within the cerebral aqueduct. In the 6 months between initial imaging and our seeing the patient, the tumor demonstrated substantial interval growth, so the patient was offered resection. The tumor was accessed using a sitting, supracerebellar, intracollicular approach, which allowed for gross total resection of the mass without complication. Histopathology later revealed the lesion to be a heman-gioblastoma. Two years after surgery, the patient was doing well with no neurologic deficits.
   CONCLUSION'S: We report the first case of an aqueductal hemangioblastoma describe our use of a sitting, supracerebellar, intracollicular approach to access tumors occupying this cerebrospinal fluid space.

ID TUMOR BED CYSTS; COMPLICATION; IMPLANTATION
AB BACKGROUND: Symptomatic cyst formation after brain tumor resection is a rare complication of the early postoperative phase. We describe a complicated case of postoperative symptomatic cyst formation after gross total removal of a convexity meningioma.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 59-year-old woman presented with recent onset motor aphasia. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed a left convexity tumor. We performed gross total resection of the tumor, which was pathologically diagnosed as an atypical meningioma. Tumor resection and decompression of the normal cerebral hemisphere improved aphasia. However, 3 days after surgery, her motor aphasia worsened. Computed tomography scan confirmed that the frontal lobe was being compressed by an enlargement of the postoperative tumor cavity. Conservative therapy did not shrink the cavity, and her motor aphasia persisted. Therefore, 21 days after surgery, a drainage tube was inserted into the enlarged cavity using a neuroendoscope, which promoted shrinkage of the cavity and improved her motor aphasia. We suspected that the enlargement of the postoperative cavity was because of the presence of a valve-like structure.
   CONCLUSIONS: Even though formation of symptomatic cystic lesions after brain tumor resection is rare, neurosurgeons should be aware of such early postoperative complications and their management strategies.

AB There are some controversies about the surgical treatment strategy of mirror aneurysms. Whether to choose 1-stage or 2-stage surgery, bilateral or unilateral craniotomy, or surgical or interventional treatment are the main points in dispute. In this review, the different surgery strategies faced by patients are discussed. Different surgical methods are adopted based on the patient's individual state and the location and size of the aneurysm. A new imaging method is introduced using 3D Slicer, which clearly recognizes the relationship among aneurysm, brain tissue, skull, and nerve. The 3D Slicer can help surgeons undertake adequate preoperative preparation. In addition, we also introduce some ruptured factors (e.g., age, gender, hypertension, morphologic, and hemodynamic) concerning mirror aneurysm. Systematic discussion of the controversies and methods in surgical treatment of mirror aneurysms may provide new perspectives in future research for the prevention and treatment of mirror aneurysms.

AB BACKGROUND: The current treatment for patients with relapsed malignant glioma (MG) remains unsatisfactory. Use of hypofractionated stereotactic radiotherapy (HFSRT) for recurrent MG has shown some encouraging results and may be a viable option.
   METHODS: We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of articles that investigated the use of HFSRT for recurrent MG. Relevant studies were obtained through searching PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library. Data about treatment regimens, median overall survival, and radiation necrosis (RN), as well as other major neurologic complications were extracted. We performed a descriptive analysis of the median overall survival and meta-analysis of the reported rates of RN and other major neurologic complications (MNCs).
   RESULTS: A total of 26 studies were included in our study, comprising 861 patients. Median overall survival ranged from 8.6 to 18 months. A total of 19 studies were included to perform a meta-analysis of the RN rate and the pooled RN rate was 5% (3%-7%). The pooled rate of other MNCs was 2% (1%-4%), calculated from 20 studies.
   CONCLUSIONS: The present evidence suggests that HFSRT is an efficacious and safe treatment approach to treat patients with recurrent MG. However, the retrospective and observational nature of the studies included in our systematic review and meta-analysis restricted formation of more solid conclusions. Thus, well-designed prospective controlled trials are warranted to further define the therapeutic role of HFSRT for recurrent MG.

AB BACKGROUND: Brain metastasis (BM) from breast cancer is increasingly encountered clinically because of the continuing success in the oncological control of the primary disease. Data-driven reports on the surgical treatment of BM from breast cancer are sparse in sub-Saharan Africa.
   METHODS: This is a prospective cohort study of the outcome of surgical excision of BM from breast cancer in an academic surgical practice in Ibadan, Nigeria.
   RESULTS: A total of 12 consecutive cerebral metastasectomies, all in females with primary breast cancer, were recorded over the study period. The median age (range) at breast cancer diagnosis was 41 (27-72) years, and the time interval from primary disease to BM was 19 (12-29) months. The BM was the first site of systemic disease progression in all, and was heralded by headache, seizures, and hemiparesis in more than two-thirds of the patients. The brain lesions were multiple in a quarter: >4 cm large in 42% and were located supratentorial in >80%. They all achieved good recovery and in-hospital outcome after surgical lesionectomy-infra- and supratentorial craniotomies-but only two-thirds could access post-surgical adjuvant whole brain radiation therapy. Median survival after cerebral metastasectomy was 18 (11-55) months, and more than a quarter were alive for >= 3years. These survival statistics were significantly better than those of a contemporary cohort of our patients with breast cancer who also had BMs that were not surgically treated for various clinical and logistic limitations.
   CONCLUSIONS: Surgical resection is feasible for BM from breast cancer even in low-resource clinical practice. It has a salutary effect on the patients' quality of life.

   hemorrhage; Subtemporal approach
ID PETROCLIVAL MENINGIOMAS; TRANSTENTORIAL APPROACH; ANTERIOR PETROSECTOMY;
   MICROSURGICAL ANATOMY; SURGERY
AB OBJECTIVE: The standard combined transpetrosal approach (CTPA) is fundamentally an epidural approach that has been quite successfully practiced for many decades. However, it has some disadvantages, such as cosmetic problems, difficulties with custom-tailored petrosectomy, and cerebrospinal fluid leakage, as it is a complicated epidural procedure. We describe here a case of primary pontine hemorrhage via intradural CTPA (iCTPA), which is a modified technique of CTPA and includes intradural anterior petrosectomy and partial posterior petrosectomy without mastoidectomy and skeletonization of the sigmoid sinus.
   METHODS: A 63-year-old woman with primary pontine -montage underwent surgery via iCTPA to improve postoperative functional outcomes. After the temporal craniotomy without mastoidectomy and skeletonization of the sigmoid sinus, Kawase's triangle and Trautmann's triangle were identified from the intradural space. Resection of Kawase's triangle and partial resection of Trautmann's triangle were performed to approach the frontotemporal surface of the pons. The hematoma was irrigated and totally removed after corticotomy on the pons.
   RESULTS: The postoperative symptoms of the patient improved within 2 weeks without surgical complication.
   CONCLUSIONS: The intradural approach allows for petrosectomy and is more straightforward than the epidural route, although it can injure the vein of Labbe. Moreover, it can also reduce cosmetic problems and cerebrospinal fluid leakage. iCTPA could provide enough working space for the frontolateral surface of pontine and petroclival lesions without the need for mastoidectomy and skeletonization of the sigmoid sinus.

AB BACKGROUND: The craniovertebral junction (CVJ) may be affected by several diseases. It is an anatomically complex region, involving the osteoligamentous, vascular, and nervous structures, which makes surgery challenging. In a case of ventral compression, an anterior approach is preferable, although posterior fixation is often required. Anterior transmucosal approaches are associated with high rates of complications. However, decompression and fixation by the use of retropharyngeal extramucosal approaches may be challenging.
   OBJECTIVE: To investigate the feasibility of a single-stage, anterior, extramucosal submandibular (SM) approach modification to the CVJ for simultaneous decompression and stabilization.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a preliminary cadaveric feasibility study on 2 injected specimens. A variation of the SM approach with a short "boomerang" incision, microsurgical decompression of the ventral CVJ, and a new hybrid construct for an anterior atlantoaxial stabilization was investigated. The surgical approach, the decompression, and the instrumentation technique have been described. In addition, intraprocedural images and radiographs and also postprocedural computed tomographic images were collected. Furthermore, surgical exposure, working corridors and angles, and decompression grade were measured.
   RESULTS: The SM approach provided wide exposure of the ventral CVJ and the possibility for instrumentation and decompression by removing the anterior arch of C1 and the odontoid process.
   CONCLUSION: A single- stage anterior extramucosal SM approach for decompression and stabilization of the CVJ is feasible and could result in shorter surgical duration, avoiding the complications related to both the transmucosal approach and the prone position, although specific related risks exist. Mechanical investigation of this hybrid system and in vivo studies are needed to confirm our results.

AB We here report findings on magnetic resonance imaging from a 60-year-old patient with an epithelioid glioblastoma of the corpus callosum treated with radiotherapy in combination with concomitant and adjuvant temozolomide. Neuropathology revealed a highly aggressive molecular subtype of the epithelioid glioblastoma without an isocitrate dehydrogenase and B-Raf proto-oncogene mutation or a 06-methylguanine-DNA-methyltransferase promoter hypermethylation. This subtype is typically associated with an unfavorable clinical course and poor overall survival. Unexpectedly, the first follow-up magnetic resonance imaging 10 weeks after chemoradiation completion revealed an early and almost complete treatment response.

AB BACKGROUND: Cranial dural arteriovenous fistulas (dAVFs) are abnormal connections between arteries supplying the dura mater and the cranial venous system. These present with various signs and symptoms. Progressive ocular manifestations are quite rare and may be confused with carotid cavernous fistulas (CCF).
   CASE DESCRIPTION: Here, we present 2 cases of dAVF manifesting with ocular symptomatology referred to our center erroneously diagnosed as CCF, and discuss the effect of venous drainage pattern on the clinical presentation.
   CONCLUSIONS: Ocular manifestations of cerebrovascular origin are not necessarily associated with CCF or cavernous sinus dAVF. Other vascular malformations such as dAVFs should be considered specifically when accompanied by venous stenosis distal to the site of the fistula.

AB BACKGROUND: Diagnosis and management of congenital anomalies of the can be a challenge because of their complex presentations. We present an uncommon case of congenital deformity of the spine with L4-L5 vertebral fusion, mimicking a single vertebra, and 13 spondylolisthesis treated by oblique lumbar interbody fusion (OLIF).
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 69-year-old woman presented with increasing lower -.A pain radiating to the left leg, with aggravation of symptoms for the past 6 months, causing difficulty in walking. She also complained of paresthesia along the 13-15 dermatomes in both legs, with more prominence on the left side. Imaging revealed fusion deformity of the L4-L5 vertebrae, as well as degenerative spondylolisthesis at the 13-14 level. After treatment with OLIF, the patient had an uneventful recovery period. Comparisons were made between the preoperative and 6-month follow-up visual analog scale and the Oswestry Disability Index scores. The patient showed significant improvement in the scores, as well as in her symptoms.
   CONCLUSIONS: OLIF is a promising technique that can be applied in the management of degenerative disk diseases and also for deformities that may be formidable to treat by adopting the traditional posterior approach.

AB BACKGROUND: Neurologic complications are common in patients with human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS). Although both the central nervous system (CNS) and the peripheral nervous system can be affected, 80% of patients with HIV/AIDS have CNS involvement during the course of their illness. The brain is the primary site of HIV/AIDS. associated CNS complications. Spinal cord involvement is rare, particularly focal intramedullary spinal cord lesions without any associated cerebral lesions. Among various opportunistic infections and malignancies, toxoplasmosis and CNS lymphoma are the most common causes of focal neurologic disease in patients with HIV/AIDS. Distinguishing between toxoplasmosis and CNS lymphoma is challenging, as the diseases have similar clinical presentations.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: In a woman with newly diagnosed HIV infection, myelopathy manifested as an isolated, single intramedullary spinal cord lesion.
   CONCLUSIONS: Common methods to distinguish the diagnoses of toxoplasmosis and CNS lymphoma are addressed. There should be a high index of suspicion for toxoplasmosis in patients with HIV/AIDS presenting with a focal intramedullary spinal cord lesion.

DT Review
DE Fluorescein; Ganglioglioma; Hyperhidrosis; Intramedullary spinal cord
   tumor
AB BACKGROUND: Hyperhidrosis is caused by sympathetic dysfunction of the central or peripheral nervous system. However, intramedullary spinal cord tumors presenting with hyperhidrosis as an initial symptom have been rarely reported in the literature.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: This case involves an 18-year-old man who presented with abnormal enhanced sweating and flushing on the bilateral side of his face and neck that had persisted for 6 years. Magnetic resonance (MR) images revealed that at the C7-T2 levels of the spinal cord, a large intramedullary tumor was involved in the cervicothoracic region. The patient underwent gross total resection of the tumor via the fluorescein-guided technique and intraoperative neurophysiologic monitoring. The histopathologic diagnosis revealed ganglioglioma. The symptoms gradually improved after surgery, and the patient presented with virtually complete remission at the end of an 18-month follow-up.
   CONCLUSIONS: Few cases of intramedullary spinal cord tumors presenting as hyperhidrosis in clinical manifestation have been reported in the literature. Sympathetic irritation by the tumor, particularly in the location around the gray matter of the lateral spinal cord, may account for the hyperhidrosis as the initial symptom in this patient. Therefore, if a patient has autonomic dysfunction, the spine cord should be additionally examined using MR imaging.

DE Carotid artery; Endovascular treatment; Retained knife; Vascular injury
AB BACKGROUND: We describe endovascular coil embolization of the internal carotid artery before removing a retained knife blade partially occluding the lacerum segment of the internal carotid artery.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 21-year-old male presented to the emergency department with a retained transcranial knife after sustaining a stab to the left temporal scalp. He was hemodynamically stable and neurologically intact on presentation. Computed tomography angiography followed by digital subtraction angiography revealed narrowing of the lacerum segment of the left internal carotid artery by the tip of the knife blade with adequate blood flow from the contralateral internal carotid artery. Embolization and occlusion of the internal carotid artery proximal and distal to the knife tip were performed. The patient was transferred to the neurosurgical operating room for extraction of the knife. A repeat left carotid artery angiogram post knife extraction showed no displacement of the coils and no extravasation of contrast. Follow-up imaging confirmed a good outcome.
   CONCLUSIONS: A staged approach of digital subtraction angiography and endovascular therapy followed by surgical treatment is a safe and effective management strategy for patients presenting with a retained transcranial knife and suspected vascular injury.

   COMPLICATIONS
AB BACKGROUND: Chronic subdural hematoma is a common neurosurgical disease and the most benign form of intracranial hematoma. Most patients are successfully treated with simple burr hole evacuation and external drainage with good outcome and low rate of complications. Brainstem hemorrhage is a rare cause of severe disability in these patients, and cannot be ignored.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: We report the first case of bilateral oculomotor palsy to a midbrain hemorrhage after evacuation of a unilateral chronic subdural hematoma. The relevant literature is also reviewed to better understand the causes of this rare but disabling occurrence and how it can be prevented during and after surgery.
   CONCLUSIONS: Neurosurgeons must have awareness of remote intracerebral hemorrhage after burr hole evacuation of chronic subdural hematoma, and take measures to avoid it during surgery. Our experience and the review of the relevant literature demonstrate that preoperative computed tomography can provide information to identify the patients at major risk.

DE Aneurysmal malformations; Pial arteriovenous fistula; Vein of Galen
AB BACKGROUND: Pial arteriovenous fistulas are abnormal vascular connections between arteries and the cranial venous system on the surface of the brain in the pia mater. In contrast to vein of Galen aneurysmal malformations, they lack a true vascular nidus and may only indirectly involve the vein of Galen.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: An 18-month-old boy was referred to us with a history of seizures, drowsiness, bulging cephalic veins, and cranial nerves palsy identified as vein of Galen aneurysmal malformation according to initial magnetic resonance imaging. Digital subtraction angiography showed a vertebrobasilar junction pial high-flow fistula between the basilar artery and anterior pontomesencephalic vein, causing retrograde flow, dilation, and tortuosity of the lateral and posterior mesencephalic vein as well as the vein of Galen. Endovascular treatment, including coil embolization of fistula site, was done successfully without complication resulting in recovery from previous symptoms and signs.
   CONCLUSIONS: If cerebral venous dilations are encountered, one must keep in mind that the location of the fistula may not be in close proximity to the dilated veins, especially when there is a suspicion for vein of Galen aneurysmal malformation. Other pathologies, such as pial arteriovenous fistula, in a region away from the site of the vein of Galen must be considered.

ID GRAFT; COMPLICATION; SURGERY
AB BACKGROUND: As the prevalence of spinal fusion surgery has increased, reliable and safe bone graft substitutes have been developed in response. Biocompatible osteoconductive polymer (BOP) has been used as a bone graft alternative for spine surgery. We present a case of cervical myelopathy due to extrusion of BOP 23 years after surgery and discuss the pathophysiology in terms of spinal fusion.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 65-year-old man presented with a 3-month history of cervical myelopathic symptoms. Twenty-three years earlier, the patient had undergone cervical surgery for a C6-7 herniated disc with the use of BOP. Imaging studies of the cervical spine showed cord compression due to extruded BOP at C6-7. He underwent corpectomy of the C7 vertebral body and removal of the BOP for the neural decompression, combined with interbody fusion by use of an iliac bone graft and plate fixation. During the operation, crumbly fibers of the BOP were easily removed. His myelopathic symptoms improved immediately after surgery. Postoperative magnetic resonance imaging also showed successful decompression of the spinal cord. Histologically, a foreign body reaction and bony degeneration were found around the synthetic fibers of the BOP.
   CONCLUSIONS: Spine surgeons should recognize the pathophysiology of the BOP used for spine fusion surgery. Although BOP is not currently used for spinal surgery, patients undergoing previous surgery with the BOP can present with related complications. Revision surgery is recommended to remove the unincorporated BOP and achieve solid spine fusion.

AB Arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) are high-pressure vascular lesions that can present formidable therapeutic challenges. One treatment option for these lesions is stereotactic radiosurgery, which may be used to provoke progressive thrombosis of the draining veins and subsequent obliteration of the AVM nidus. In this clinical image, we successfully demonstrate this therapeutic modality with the case of a 26-year-old man with a large frontal AVM, treated with stereotactic radiosurgery.

AB OBJECTIVE: An updated and comprehensive review on dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumor (DNET) focusing on differential diagnosis, atypical presentation, seizure outcome, and risk of malignant transformation.
   METHODS: A PubMed/MEDLINE-based literature search has been performed using "dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumor" as a keyword. Two treated cases characterized by an atypical presentation have been reviewed.
   RESULTS: Of 1162 articles, 200 relevant studies have been selected. DNET is a benign mixed neuronal-glial tumor causing drug-resistant epilepsy primarily in children and young adults. The typical radiological pattern is a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) T1-hypointense, T2-, and fluid-attenuated inversion-recovery hyperintense multicystic lesion involving the cerebral cortex with no edema. Contrast enhancement may be present and a focal cortical dysplasia is commonly associated with it. MRI diffusion, perfusion, and spectroscopy have a paramount role in the differential diagnosis. The "specific glioneuronal elements" are pathognomonic. They are positive for S100 protein, synaptofisin, neuronal nuclei, oligodendrocyte transcription factor, neurite outgrowth inhibitor, and microtubule-associated protein 2, but negative for glial fibrillary acidic protein. As opposed to v-myb avian myeloblastosis viral oncogene homolog, isocitrate dehydrogenase-1/isocitrate dehydrogenase-2 mutation and codeletion 1p-19q, fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 and BRAF V600E mutations are present. The effectiveness of surgery on seizure outcome has been established. Rare malignant transformations have been reported, especially in extra-temporal and complex forms.
   CONCLUSIONS: Advanced MRI techniques are fundamental in the differential diagnosis for DNET versus other low-grade gliomas. Immuno-phenotype assessment and search for fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 and BRAF V600E mutations limit the risk of misdiagnoses. A gross total tumor removal is generally associated with a seizure-free outcome. Recurrences and malignant transformations may rarely follow, legitimizing MRI surveillance in cases of subtotal tumor resection.

DE Delayed surgical intervention; Diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma; Diffuse

   Thalamic glioma
AB BACKGROUND: The 2016 World Health Organization Classification of Tu-mours of the Central Nervous System was revised to include a new diagnostic entity, diffuse midline glioma, H3 K27M-mutant (DMG-K27M), a highly agressive tumor with a mean survival time of 1 year after diagnosis. DMG-K27M is classified as a World Health Organization grade IV tumor regardless of hist& pathologic features, and there is currently no effective treatment for it despite ongoing research.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: We present a case of a 39-year-old man with a slow-growing thalamic glioma with histone H3 lysine 27-to-methionine mutation. This patient received surgical intervention 3 years after the initial discovery of the tumor. Because the patient did not receive any preoperative treatment for DMG-K27M, this case reflects 1 possible natural course of progression for this type of malignancy.
   CONCLUSIONS: There are currently no effective therapeutic options for treatment of DUIG-K27M. The slow tumor growth and prolonged survival time (>= 3 years) in the absence of intervention in this case serve as a reminder that much is still not known about histone H3 lysine 27-to-methionine mutation and how it impacts the pathophysiology, diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of the disease. Careful evaluation is warranted to determine if early intervention is the best approach when treating DMG-K27M.

AB BACKGROUND: Primary optic apparatus involvement by lymphoma is an exceedingly rare entity, with only 3 cases previously reported in the literature. Whether this represents a distinct pathology, metastatic disease from an unidentified systemic lymphoma, or the first manifestation of evolving primary central nervous system lymphoma is not currently understood.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: We present a case of a young immunocompetent male with rapidly progressive visual loss who was found to have isolated lymphomatous involvement of the optic apparatus. We discuss the classification of the lesion, the clinical presentation, the diagnostic workup, and the visual and overall prognosis. Special consideration is given to the operative approach and selecting an appropriate site for biopsy based on the visual exam at the time of presentation.
   CONCLUSIONS: Primary optic nerve lymphoma is a rare disease that requires a systemic workup and a multidisciplinary approach to treatment.

DE Conservative treatment; Decompression; Magnetic resonance imaging;
   Spinal subdural hematoma
ID RESOLUTION
AB BACKGROUND: Spontaneous spinal subdural hematoma (SDH) is rare but leads to severe nerve compression. According to the symptoms, surgery decompression and conservative treatment are justified options. We present a spontaneous spinal SDH case treated by decompression surgery for the lumbar region and conservative observation for the thoracic region. A series of images of the disease course is available.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 55-year-old woman without malignancy or coagulopathy history presented with progressive low back pain for the past 2 weeks. Progressive bilateral leg weakness happened 1 week ago. On the day she called for help, she presented with bilateral leg grade 2 muscle power and generalized back pain. There was no headache or meningeal sign. An absent bilateral knee reflex was found. Magnetic resonance imaging showed a space-occupying lesion at the T2-T6 and T12-L1 levels in the ventral and dorsal spinal canal, leading to cord compression. Due to rapid neurologic function deterioration, emergent T12-L1 laminectomy was performed. We found a T12-L1 tense dura sac with subdural hematoma ventral to the cord. Removal of the SDH was performed. T2-T6 levels were treated conservatively. She returned ambulant 1 week after operation. Magnetic resonance images at 3 months and 1 year later showed the SDH being absorbed and replaced by adhesive arachnoid cysts along the whole T and L spine. However, these lesions are asymptomatic for at least 2 years.
   CONCLUSIONS: Surgical intervention is recommended in patients presenting with severe neurologic deficits. Conservative treatment is a reasonable option for asymptomatic patients.

DE Direct bypass; Intracranial hemorrhage; Moyamoya disease;
   Periventricular anastomosis
ID ANEURYSMS
AB BACKGROUND: Although superficial temporal artery (STA) to middle cerebral artery (MCA) anastomosis is a beneficial treatment for hemorrhagic moyamoya disease, indeterminate mechanisms can cause rebleeding even after successful bypass surgery. We describe a case with a prominent collateral from the lenticulostriate artery (ISA) causing multiple recurrent hemorrhages after successful STA-MCA anastomosis.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 49-year-old Japanese woman with moyamoya disease was referred to our institution after suffering intracranial hemorrhage on 2 occasions. Angiography revealed multiple anastomotic vessels branching from a prominent LSA to connect medullary arteries in the periventricular area corresponding to the location of the hemorrhage. She underwent STA-MCA anastomoses and the bypass widely perfused the MCA territory; however, intracranial hemorrhage recurred in the same hemisphere. Angiography revealed sustained dilatation of the medial anastomotic branches from the LSA with de novo pseudoaneurysm, whereas the lateral branches showed shrinkage. Subsequent surgical treatment included direct bypass targeting the medial hemispheric surface in which the medial branches were distributed; marked shrinkage of the branches and disappearance of the aneurysm were obtained without infarct.
   CONCLUSIONS: Lenticulostriate anastomotic branches distributed medially to the anterior cerebral artery territory should be given more attention as an intractable cause of hemorrhage after successful STA-MCA anastomosis. Although challenging, direct bypass targeting the area reached by collateral vessels could be considered an alternative treatment strategy for this pathologic condition.

AB Anterior inferior cerebellar artery (AICA) aneurysm is a rare cerebral entity, and its presentation in association with a hypervascularized tumor is even more exceptional. In this study, we describe a patient with rare coexistent pathologic conditions in combination with a cerebellar hypervascularized tumor with an outflow-related AICA aneurysm. A 1-stage procedure to remove both lesions was carried out after meticulous discussion with patient. Postoperative imaging demonstrated no residual aneurysm and total resection of the tumor, which was pathologically diagnosed as hemangioblastoma (HB). She made an excellent neurologic outcome and was discharged in unremarkable condition. At her 3-month follow-up visit, her condition remained stable for vasculopathologic states and neurologic functions. To our knowledge, this is the first published clinical experience regarding cerebellar HB coexistent with an AICA aneurysm that involved the efferent segment of the tumor's feeding vessel. Patients with coexistent vascular pathologic conditions should be aggressively treated, not by the wait-and-see practice, in case of unexpected rupture in the future.

ID REDUCE BLOOD-LOSS; EFFICACY; SAFETY; PLACEBO; TRIAL
AB OBJECTIVE: To investigate the influence of tranexamic acid (TXA) on blood loss and blood transfusion in multiple-level spine surgery and evaluate whether hemoglobin and platelet levels are altered as a result.
   METHOD: This meta-analysis conducted an exhaustive search of literature from Pubmed, Embase, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, and CNKI databases. Stata 11.0 was used to analyze the pooled data. Mean differences (MD) of blood loss, transfusion volume, hemoglobin and platelet levels, and odds ratio (OR) of proportion of transfusion were extracted and compared between the TXA group and controls. Publication bias and sensitivity analysis were also performed.
   RESULT: A total of 11 studies (6 RCTs and 5 retrospective studies) were enrolled in this meta-analysis according to the inclusion criteria. The data showed that administration of TXA can decrease intraoperative blood loss and perioperative blood transfusion compared to controls (standard mean difference = - 0.50; 95% confidence interval [CI]: -0.84, - 0.16; I-2 = 52.9%; P = 0.004) (OR = 0.48; 95% CI: 0.29, 0.78; I-2 = 0%; P = 0.003). Moreover, TXA can maintain a superior hemoglobin level after surgery in contrast to the control group (standard mean difference = -027; 95% CI: 0.07, 0.47; I-2 = 0%; P = 0.009). The above results were also observed and verified after accounting for publication bias and sensitivity analysis.
   CONCLUSION: The application of TXA can effectively reduce intraoperative blood loss and perioperative blood transfusion in patients undergoing multiple-level spine surgery, and it can restore hemoglobin levels after surgery.

AB BACKGROUND: Subependymomas are rare in the spinal cord. They are expansile, intramedullary spinal cord masses, eccentrically located with minimal gadolinium enhancement.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: We present a case of subependymoma originating from cervical cord with an unusual exophytic appearance. Hallmarks of subependymoma and treatment are reviewed.
   CONCLUSIONS: This is the first case, to our knowledge, where imaging .ales a mass appearing to be completely extramedullary with a primary exophytic component. Therefore, subependymomas should remain on the differential for masses in the spinal cord that appear extramedullary and exophytic.

   COMPUTERIZED-TOMOGRAPHY; DIAGNOSIS; MANAGEMENT; BASE; LOCALIZATION
AB INTRODUCTION: Diagnosis of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leaks traditionally involves laboratory testing of markers and appropriate imaging. Surgical localization can be difficult, and the inability to accurately localize skull base defects leads to increased rates of repair failure and complications. Many imaging techniques localizing and identifying CSF leaks have been proposed. Comparisons of current and investigational imaging techniques used to localize CSF leaks are reviewed.
   METHODS: A comprehensive and systematic search through PubMed, Scopus, and reference lists from relevant articles was completed to identify literature on sensitivities of different imaging methods for localization and detection of CSF leaks. Prospective, retrospective, and case series published since 1995 that addressed imaging techniques for CSF leaks confined to the skull base were included. Sensitivities of each major imaging technique proposed were recorded and analyzed.
   RESULTS: In total, 133 studies initially were screened from 2125 studies on preliminary search. Of these, 38 studies were included based on inclusion criteria. Studies were segregated by imaging modality. A total of 1000 patients with CSF leaks subsequently were evaluated.
   CONCLUSIONS: Although radionuclide cisternography has been the historical standard, recent imaging techniques have emerged considering the low sensitivity. Computed tomography cisternography with contrast also has low sensitivity, even in active leaks. Although high-resolution computed tomography is commonly the initial study of choice, magnetic resonance imaging methods, particularly 3-dimensional imaging, may prove to be a more sensitive study of choice. Computed tomography/magnetic resonance imaging combination methods may show promise in localizing CSF leaks. Stratifying by status and etiology may be an important determinant. Further studies investigating various imaging techniques for localizing CSF leaks are needed.

   regeneration
ID CALVARIAL DEFECTS; CRANIOPLASTY; DURA; GROWTH; IMMATURE; CHILDREN
AB BACKGROUND: In children, decompressive craniectomy is commonly per-formed in cases of increased intracranial pressure that is not medically managed. Currently, it is standard practice to perform cranioplasty after decompressive craniectomy, although optimal timing for the procedure remains controversial. To date, few studies have reported spontaneous cranial bone regeneration in children without intervention.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 7-year-old female presented with frontotemporal bone .._matures accompanied by dura mater lacerations and brain edema after a motor vehicle accident. She underwent a large decompressive craniectomy and repair of the lacerated dura with a collagen dural substitute. The patient was discharged from the hospital and did not present for follow-up until 10 months after surgery. At that time, computed tomography imaging revealed remarkable spontaneous bone regeneration. With conservative management, she developed enough bone regeneration in the calvarial defect area that cranioplasty surgery was deemed unnecessary. To this date, the patient has no aesthetic deformation of the skull bone and does not exhibit any residual cognitive impairment or motor deficits.
   CONCLUSIONS: This case report shows that cranial bone regeneration is possible in children older than 6 years old, bypassing the need for cranioplasty after decompressive craniectomy. On the basis of this observation, we recommend that more studies should be performed to identify the factors involved in spontaneous skull bone regeneration in the pediatric population.

   CLASSIFICATION; HYPERTROPHY; EXPERIENCE
AB BACKGROUND: Dysplastic gangliocytoma (Lhermitte-Duclos disease [LDD]) typically presents as a PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog)-positive, insidious unilateral mass of the cerebellar cortex. Patients can present with symptoms of increased intracranial pressure. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) will reveal a characteristic laminar/tigroid appearance. Surgical management has been superior to conservative measures for symptomatic lesions. The outcomes for bilateral craniotomy have not yet been described.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 50-year-old patient with Cowden syndrome had initially presented with vertigo and imbalance. T2-weighted MRI showed a striated pattern of hypointensity and hyperintensity in bilateral cerebellar hemispheres consistent with Lhermitte-Duclos disease. He underwent right posterior fossa craniotomy with near total surgical resection and achieved symptom resolution. However, 3 years later, asymptomatic recurrence of the right-sided LDD and progression of left-sided LDD were noted. These were managed with a 1-year course of temozolomide. Both lesions remained stable until 4 years after completion of temozolomide. MRI demonstrated progression in the left hemisphere requiring a second surgical resection. PTEN analysis of the resected lesion was negative for mutation.
   CONCLUSIONS: To the best of our knowledge, the present case is the first reported case of bilateral cerebellar hemisphere LDD ultimately managed by temporally dissociated bilateral surgical resections. Our patient was unique in that he had undergone surgery for resection of LDD, followed by a second surgery for contralateral progression 8 years later. The therapeutic options to prevent recurrence are limited, although temozolomide did seem to impede progression. Symptomatic patients will typically benefit most from surgical intervention. Given the strong association between adult LDD and Cowden syndrome, maintaining close follow-up care and possible surveillance imaging will be essential.

ID OUTCOMES; PREDICTORS; RISK
AB INTRODUCTION: Stent thrombosis (ST) is a known complication after intracranial stent implantation. The pathophysiology of ST is multifactorial, and standardized treatments for ST remain uncertain.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A patient harboring an unruptured aneurysm of the posterior communicating segment of the left internal carotid artery was treated with stent-assisted coil embolization while on dual antiaggregation therapy. Despite adherence to medication, ST occurred 8 days after the intervention. Following tirofiban infusion, the thrombus dissolved and clinical symptoms improved However, after tirofiban was stopped, the patient experienced again ischemic symptoms. The patient underwent high-flow extracranial-to-intracranial bypass with good patency of the graft and resolution of symptoms.
   CONCLUSIONS: In case of refractory ST, high-flow extracranial-to-intracra- bypass proved to be in this case a feasible and effective rescue option.

   Arteriovenous Fistulas at Craniocervical Junction: Case Report and
   Literature Review

LA English
DT Review
DE Craniocervical junction; dAVF; Perimedullary AVF
AB BACKGROUND: The association between a dural arteriovenous fistula (dAVF) perimedullary arteriovenous fistula (AVF) is rarely observed at the cranio-cervical junction (CCJ). We present a case of subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) with concurrent dAVF and perimedullary AVF at the CCJ. Here, we describe the cause of bleeding and the process of determining whether it was a varix or an arterial aneurysm.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 69-year-old man with SAH visited the emergency department. A dAVF at the CCJ was detected on digital subtraction angiography (DSA). However, after 3 weeks, when the DSA was repeated, a perimedullary AVF and varix were identified. We performed an endovascular treatment, but because the perimedullary AVF remained, we performed a direct surgery. The patient was discharged without weakness, but this left abducens nerve palsy remained.
   CONCLUSIONS: In recent reports, SAH caused by concurrent dAVF and perimedullary AVF raised the possibility of an arterial aneurysm. However, in this case, the possibility of venous bleeding was high and a varix rather than an aneurysm was observed, On the basis of the reported cases, concurrent dAVF and perimedullary AVF at the CCJ is a "middle-flow arteriovenous shunt" that may induce a varix or an arterial aneurysm.

AB BACKGROUND: Adult sellar atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumor (ATRT) is a rare diagnosis that has recently been shown to be a clinicopathologically and genetically distinct variant of ATRT occurring almost exclusively in middle-aged women. Although up to one third of pediatric ATRT is caused by a familial syndrome, no previous cases of a familial adult sellar ATRT have been reported. We present the first case report of a familial germline mutation causing adult sellar ATRT and a literature review of 29 previously reported cases of sporadic adult sellar ATRT.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 51-year-old woman with a family history of brain tumors spanning 3 generations presented with visual decline and was diagnosed with an adult sellar ATRT. Genetic studies showed a heterozygous splice-site loss-of-function mutation of the INI1 gene in exon 7. Treatment included endoscopic endonasal biopsy, craniospinal irradiation, and focal tumor boost, followed by adjuvant chemotherapy.
   CONCLUSIONS: This is the first case report of a familial germline mutation causing adult sellar ATRT. This article highlights the importance of a thorough family history and genetic testing in these individuals and reviews the current genetics, histopathology, and multidisciplinary treatment approach in this rare condition.

AB BACKGROUND: The PulseRider (Pulsar Vascular, Inc, Los Gatos, California, USA) device was developed to treat wide-neck aneurysms, and the Adjunctive Neurovascular Support of Wide-neck aneurysm Embolization and Reconstruction (ANSWER) Trial showed efficacy in the treatment of unruptured wide-neck aneurysms. Our case series demonstrates the use of the PulseRider device in the treatment of ruptured wide-neck aneurysms.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: The 2 patients in our series presented with subarachnoid hemorrhage secondary to ruptured basilar apex aneurysms. The patients were taken to the neurointervention suite for embolization of their aneurysms with the PulseRider and platinum microcoils.
   CONCLUSIONS: In both cases, a Roy Raymond class III embolization was achieved. The patients recovered from their subarachnoid hemorrhage and were discharged with resolution of their symptoms. The presented cases document the safety and efficacy of treating ruptured aneurysms with the PulseRider device.

DT Review
DE Abscess; Dermoid cyst; Frontotemporal tract; Intradiploic
AB BACKGROUND: Frontotemporal dermal sinus tracts with associated dermoid cysts are very rare, with only 1 found in the largest series to date and 10 total documented case reports.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: We present the first case to our knowledge of a dermal sinus tract associated with 2 intradiploic dermoid cysts in the rare location of the pterion and sphenosquamosal suture. The patient was a 15-month-old girl presenting with periorbital cellulitis who was found to have 2 connected intradiploic cysts on radiographic imaging. The mass was excised, and pathology was consistent with a ruptured dermoid cyst.
   CONCLUSIONS: We review of the literature and argue for early identification and prophylactic surgical resection to avoid complications associated with infection and to mitigate risk of subtotal resection.

AB OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of surgical revascularization versus conservative treatment and different surgical modalities, in order to provide evidence for the patient with moyamoya disease (MMD) to choose the appropriate treatment.
   METHODS: We comprehensively searched PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library for articles published regarding MMD treatment. If the I-2 value, which evaluated the heterogeneity, was <50%, a fixed-effect model was used; if not, a random effect model was applied.
   RESULTS: Twenty-seven articles were included in the meta-analysis. The surgery group is more advantageous in reducing the risk of future stroke events than conservative treatment in MMD patients (odds ratio [OR] 0.26, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.20-0.33, P < 0.001). In addition, the surgical group also had an advantage in terms of increased cerebral perfusion (OR 7.16, 95% CI 3.28-15.64, P < 0.001) and death due to rebleeding (OR 0.27, 95% CI 0.10-0.72, P < 0.01). Direct surgery showed a significant efficacy over indirect surgery (OR 2.03, 95% CI 1.32-3.13, P < 0.01). No obvious difference was found between the direct and indirect bypass subset (OR 0.76, 95% CI 0.51-1.14, P = 0185). Angiographic results in patients undergoing direct bypass surgery are more pronounced (OR 0.20, 95% CI 0.06-0.67, P < 0.01).
   CONCLUSIONS: In patients with symptomatic moyamoya disease, bypass surgery is more effective than conservative treatment to prevent future strokes. In surgical patients, direct bypass seems to reduce the risk of stroke more than an indirect bypass.

TI Safety and Efficacy of Mechanical Thrombectomy in 2 Cases of Acute
   Ischemic Stroke in Centennial Patients
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY

DT Article
DE Acute ischemic stroke; Centennials; Eldest patient; Mechanical
   thrombectomy
AB BACKGROUND: Mechanical thrombectomy (MT) became a standard of care L. stroke patients after the positive results of 5 randomized trials in 2015. However, elderly patients >65 were excluded from those trials. Recent studies and clinical trials examining the efficacy of MT in patients older than the age of 85 have shown that good outcomes can be achieved with careful patient selection.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: Two patients older than the age of 100 who presented with stroke were treated with MT. Although the cases were different in baseline neurologic status, surgical history, and gender, both achieved successful procedures.
   CONCLUSION: We believe that MT in centennials is technically safe and effective and should be considered. In this age group a careful assessment of existing medical condition and a thorough discussion with the family about goals of care is of paramount importance to optimize clinical outcomes.

SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
LA English
DT Article
DE CSF diversion; Intracranial pressure; Lumbar cerebrospinal fluid
   drainage; Persistent brain herniation; Sinking craniotomy flap syndrome;
   Trephination syndrome
AB BACKGROUND: The sinking skin flap syndrome, also known as the syndrome of the trephined or the trephination syndrome, occurs in patients who have undergone a decompressive craniectomy. As opposed to this, persistent brain herniation also occurs in patients after a decompressive craniectomy and a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) drainage procedure is one of the therapies used to reduce it. A continuous lumbar CSF drainage procedure can upset the pressure dynamics of the atmosphere versus intracranial pressures to a point of fatal clinical deterioration and hence needs to be closely monitored.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: Our case report speaks of persistent brain herniation in which drainage of CSF led to a trephination syndrome, which was reversed once again, by measures to increase CSF production and intracranial pressure.
   CONCLUSIONS: Timely intervention eventually led to a favorable outcome and avoidance of a catastrophy.

AB The carotid sinus nerve branches off the glossopharyngeal nerve just after its appearance from the jugular foramen, descends along the internal carotid artery, and enters the carotid sinus. There have been many studies of the pathway and the course of the carotid sinus nerve and its communications with surrounding nerves. The intercommunication is exceedingly complicated. Acknowledgment of its anatomic diversity can be important in specific operations dealing with this area. Herein we review the anatomy, variations, pathology, and clinical applications of the carotid sinus nerve.

ID MIDDLE MENINGEAL ARTERY
AB INTRODUCTION: Intracranial dural arteriovenous fistulas (DAVFs) are an uncommon pathology, and a sphenoparietal drainage pattern is certainly rare. We present a case of a de novo sphenoparietal DAVF in a prepubescent patient previously treated for a cerebellar arteriovenous malformation (AVM) 10 years before.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 10-year-old boy presented with worsening headaches for the past few weeks, swelling of the right side of face and eye, and chemosis and proptosis of the right eye. Of note, the patient had been treated successfully for a cerebellar AVM at 6 weeks of age with advanced imaging follow-up until 4 years previously demonstrating resolution of AVM and no other abnormalities whatsoever. Suspecting a carotid cavernous fistula, we performed angiography, which revealed a sphenoparietal DAVF with feeders from both the external and internal carotid artery. Despite sudden onset of symptoms and recent previously negative imaging, bony erosion was noted on computed tomography of the head and orbits. Successful treatment was achieved via transvenous embolization.
   CONCLUSIONS: This case highlights the different array of presentations that sphenoparietal fistulas may display. Even though most DAVFs are acquired, secondary lesions and spontaneous malformations must be considered in a differential diagnosis.

ID CEREBELLOPONTINE ANGLE; TUMORS; ADENOCARCINOMA
AB BACKGROUND: The vast majority of cerebellopontine angle tumors are benign with a favorable prognosis. Metastatic tumors occurring in the cerebellopontine angle are extremely rare. Herein, we report a case of colon carcinoma metastasis to the bilateral internal auditory canals.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 59-year-old man presented with a 2-week history of binaural hearing loss. One year before admission, he was diagnosed with colon carcinoma and underwent surgical resection combined with chemotherapy. Physical examination showed complete hearing loss in bilateral ears and bilateral facial palsy. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain revealed nodules in the bilateral internal auditory canals. Middle-ear computed tomography demonstrated soft-tissue masses extending into the bilateral internal auditory canals. A diagnosis of neurofibromatosis type II was suspected. A unilateral surgical resection of the cerebellopontine angle tumor was performed. Postoperatively, the hearing loss and facial palsy remained unchanged. Pathologic examination showed metastatic, poorly differentiated carcinoma. The patient was diagnosed with metastatic colon carcinoma in the bilateral internal auditory canals. The patient refused radiotherapy and chemotherapy. The tumor progressed rapidly, and the patient developed dysphagia and choking 1 month later. The patient died of respiratory and circulatory failure 2 months after the surgery.
   CONCLUSIONS: Clinicians should be aware of metastatic tumors in the internal auditory canals. Comprehensive clinicoradiologic evaluation should be highlighted. A history of malignancy and rapidly progressive hearing loss and facial palsy may suggest the diagnosis of metastasis to the internal auditory canal. The definitive diagnosis still depends on histopathologic examination.

AB BACKGROUND: Most cases of vertebral artery stenosis are treated either conservatively or surgically. When non-conservative treatment is chosen, whether to treat it with open surgery or endovascular intervention remains a topic of divergence. In the setting of endovascular therapy failure, the vertebral to common carotid artery transposition certainly is an appropriate choice to recover the posterior circulation. Like any other open surgery, it is not devoid of soft-tissue-related complications. A pseudoaneurysm following this procedure and at this particular location is a rare but lethal complication and, to the best of our knowledge, has not yet been reported.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: We present the case of an 80-year-old man with previous ischemic stroke who presented to the emergency department with aphasia, right-sided weakness, and dysarthria. Invasive imaging revealed right vertebral stenosis and hypoplastic left vertebral artery that failed endovascular therapy. The patient was then treated with a right vertebral to common carotid artery transposition. During follow-up, a pseudoaneurysm was found and treated with a stent-assisted coiling.
   CONCLUSIONS: Pseudoaneurysms at the extracranial carotid and vertebral circulation are rare and have potential for deadly outcomes. Despite several treatments available, this anatomical location requires endovascular therapy due to efficacy and promptitude of this treatment. This is an interesting case where the patient's management required open and endovascular procedures. The pseudoaneurysm was a rare complication that, to the best of our knowledge, has not previously been reported. This case is an illustration of complementary work between open surgery and endovascular intervention.

AB BACKGROUND: Occipitocervicai congenital pathologies involving instability of the atlantoaxial joint and basilar invagination are challenging to treat owing to the complex anatomy involving neurovascular structures at the skull base and the high-risk nature of surgery close to the brainstem.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A patient presented with Alagille syndrome with multiple segmentation/fusion anomalies of the cervical spine and craniocervical junction, including fusion of the skull base and occipital condyles and partial assimilation of the Cl anterior ring and C2 dens. The head was anteriorly displaced, with C2 located immediately below the foramen magnum. There was significant kyphotic angulation due to nonunion of the base of the dens and the body of C2. The patient underwent occipitocervical osteotomies and occiput-C2 interfacet grafts for reduction of occipitocervical kyphosis along with foramen magnum decompression and occiput-C6 fusion. The patient had significant neurologic improvement and sustained improved craniocervical alignment on last follow-up.
   CONCLUSIONS: In patients with atlantoaxial instability with basilar invagination, posterior facet release, local distraction, and placement of cortical bone interbody grafts with occipitocervical fusion may be instrumental in reducing craniocervical kyphosis and compression by allowing anterior translation of the upper cervical spine relative to the skull. This method may be a safe and effective posterior-only approach for brainstem/spinal cord decompression for patients with complex craniocervical congenital malformations.
