AB Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease associated with the loss of nerve cells in the brain. The disease is affected by multifactorial pathways and leads to changes in related biomolecular levels as AD progresses. Therefore, AD should be diagnosed with combined detection of several lesions to improve accuracy. Amyloid beta 1-40, 1-42 and tau (tau) protein are milestones in AD pathology and can be used as main screening and diagnostic target markers. Here, we suggest a highly selective biosensor for detection of AD core biomarkers on one platform through distinct localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) depending on gold nanoparticles shapes, called a shape-code biosensor. This plasmonic sensor consists of only gold nanoparticles and antibody, but does not need additory methods for precise separation from multifarious samples and identification of markers. Under physiological condition, we determined a detection limit of 34.9 fM for amyloid beta (A beta) 1-40, 26 fM for A beta 1-42 and 23.6 fM for tau protein corresponding to the similar to 1, similar to 2.23 and similar to 3.12 nm of Rayleigh scattering peak shift on shape-code plasmon system for each biomarker in mimicked blood. This is the first highly sensitive shape-code biosensor to, detect AD biomarkers which can be used to diagnose AD easily in the future.

AB Highly fluorescent nitrogen doped carbon quantum dots (NCQDs) were synthesized using microwave assisted green method. It was characterized by Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM), FTIR, UV-Visible absorption and Photoluminiscence (PL) techniques. The NCQDs were immobilized with an enzyme named quinolinate phoshphoribosyl transferase (QPRTase). The NCQDs immobilized by QPRTase was used as a fluorescent bioprobe for the selective detection of endogenous neurotoxin quinolinic acid (QA) whose elevated level in serum is marker of many neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's, Huntington's and HIV associated dementia (HAD) as well as deficiency of vitamin B-6. Steady state PL studies were carried out to measure the PL response of the fabricated fluorescent bioprobe as a function of QA concentrations in human serum samples. This probe was found applicable in linear range [3.22-51 mu M] with the limit of detection similar to 6.51 mu M. It has desirable sensitivity similar to (0.02340 +/- 0.0001) mu M-1, excellent stability for similar to 7 weeks and good reproducibility. The similar response of this fluorescent bioprobe for QA detection in triple distilled water and human serum shows that it is unaffected by variation in media. Hence, this fluorescent bioprobe can be employed for QA detection in serum sample for the early detection of many diseases.

AB Methanol is a poison which is frequently discovered in alcoholic beverages. Innovative methods to detect methanol in alcoholic beverages are being constantly developed. We report for the first time a new strategy for the detection of methanol using fluorescence spectroscopy and photoelectrochemical (PEC) analysis. The analytical system is based on the oxidation of cysteine (CSH) with hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) enzymatically generated by alcohol oxidase (AOx). H2O2 oxidizes capping agent CSH, modulating the growth of CSH-stabilized cadmium sulphide quantum dots (CdS QDs). Disposable screen-printed carbon electrodes (SPCEs) modified with a conductive osmium polymer (Os-PVP) complex were employed to quantify resulting CdS QDs. This polymer facilitates the "wiring" of in situ enzymatically generated CdS QDs, which photocatalyze oxidation of 1-thioglycerol (TG), generating photocurrent as the readout signal. Likewise, we proved that our systems did not suffer from interference by ethanol. The PEC assays showed better sensitivity than conventional methods, covering a wide range of potential applications for methanol quantification.

AB Direct detection of targets in complex biological media with conventional biosensors is an enormous challenge due to the nonspecific adsorption and severe biofouling. In this work, a facile strategy for sensitive and low fouling detection of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is developed through the construction of a mixed self-assembled biosensing interface, which was composed of zwitterionic peptide (antifouling material) and ATP aptamer (bio-recognition element). The peptide and aptamer (both containing thiol groups) were simultaneously self-assembled onto gold electrode surface electrodeposited with gold nanoparticles. The developed aptasensor possessed high selectivity and sensitivity for ATP, and it showed a wide linear response range towards ATP from 0.1 pM to 5 nM. Owing to the presence of peptide with excellent antifouling property in the biosensing interface, the aptasensor can detect ATP in complex biological media with remarkably reduced biofouling or nonspecific adsorption effect. Moreover, it can directly detect ATP in 1% human whole blood without suffering from any significant interference, indicating its great potential for practical assaying of ATP in biological samples.

AB A lossy mode resonance (LMR) based sensor for urinary p-cresol testing on optical fiber substrate is developed. The sensor probe fabrication includes dip coating of nanocomposite layer of zinc oxide and molybdenum sulphide (ZnO/MoS2) over unclad core of optical fiber as the transducer layer followed by the layer of molecular imprinted polymer (MIP) as the recognition medium. The addition of molybdenum sulphide in the transducer layer increases the absorption of light in the medium which enhances the LMR properties of zinc oxide thereby increasing the conductivity and hence the sensitivity of the sensor. The sensor probe is characterized for p-cresol concentration range from 0 mu M (reference sample) to 1000 mu M in artificially prepared urine. Optimizations of various probe fabrication parameters are carried to bring out the sensor's optimal performance with a sensitivity of 11.86 nm/mu M and 28 nM as the limit of detection (LOD). A two-order improvement in LOD is obtained as compared to the recently reported p-cresol sensor. The proposed sensor possesses a response time of 15 s which is 8 times better than that reported in the literature utilizing electrochemical method. Its response time is also better than the p-cresol sensor currently available in the market for the medical field. Thus, with a fast response, significant stability and repeatability, the proposed sensor holds practical implementation possibilities in the medical field. Further, the realization of sensor probe over optical fiber substrate adds remote sensing and online monitoring feasibilities.

AB A novel magnetic controlled photoelectrochemical (PEC) sensing system was designed for sensitive detection of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) using reduced graphene oxide-functionalized BiFeO3 (rGO-BiFeO3) as the photoactive material and target-triggered hybridization chain reaction (HCR) for signal amplification. Remarkably enhanced PEC performance could be obtained by using rGO-BiFeO3 as the photoelectrode material due to its accelerated charge transfer and improved the visible light absorption. Additionally, efficient and simple operation could be achieved by introducing magnetic controlled flow-through device. The assay mainly involved in anchor DNA-conjugated magnetic bead (MB-aDNA), PSA aptamer/trigger DNA (Apt-tDNA) and two glucose oxidase-labeled hairpins (H1-GOx and H2-GOx). Upon addition of target PSA, the analyte initially reacted with the aptamer to release the trigger DNA, which partially hybridized with the anchor DNA on the MB. Thereafter, the unpaired trigger DNA on the MB opened the hairpin DNA structures in sequence and propagated a chain reaction of hybridization events between two alternating hairpins to form a long nicked double-helix with numerous GOx enzymes on it. Subsequently, the enzymatic product (H2O2) generated and consumed the photo excited electrons from rGO-BiFeO3 under visible light irradiation to enhance the photocurrent. Under optimal conditions, the magnetic controlled PEC sensing system exhibited good photocurrent responses toward target PSA within the linear range of 0.001 - 100 ng/mL with a detection limit of 0.31 pg/mL. Moreover, favorable selectivity, good stability and satisfactory accuracy were obtained. The excellent analytical performance suggested that the rGO-BiFeO3-based PEC sensing platform could be a promising tool for sensitive, efficient and low cost detection of PSA in disease diagnostics.

AB Theophylline is a popular drug for many respiratory diseases. However, certain toxic side effects may be developed and the narrow safety range raises the demand for sensitive methods to constantly monitor theophylline levels. This study presents an electrochemical approach towards theophylline detection based on the recognition by split RNA aptamers. Target induced construction of hand-in-hand RNA nanowire on the electrode surface could further absorb silver nanoparticles (Ag NPs) as electrochemical species. When theophylline is not present, RNA probes are stable and their conformations remain unchanged. In contrast, theophylline is able to trigger the hairpin opening of RNA probe and subsequent self-assembly of RNA nanowire, which could be captured by DNA tetrahedron on the electrode interface. After further decorating Ag NPs on the nanowire, silver stripping current is measured to reveal initial theophylline concentration. The developed sensing strategy shows excellent specificity and sensitivity with the limit of detection of 50 nM. Its practical utility is demonstrated by quantitative determination of theophylline levels in complex biological samples.

AB Methods based on photoelectrochemistry have been developed for immunoassay, but most involve in a low sensitivity and a relatively narrow detectable range. Herein a new bio-bar-code-based split-type photoelectrochemical (PEC) immunoassay was designed for sensitive detection of prostate-specific antigen (PSA), coupling rolling circle amplification (RCA) with enzymatic biocatalytic precipitation. The bio-bar-code-based immunoreaction was carried out on monoclonal anti-PSA antibody (mAb(1))-coated microplate using primer DNA and polyclonal anti-PSA antibody-conjugated gold nanoparticle (pDNA-AuNP-pAb(2)) with a sandwich-type assay format. Accompanying the immunocomplex, the labeled primer DNA on gold nanoparticle readily triggered RCA reaction in the presence of padlock probe/dNTPs/ligase/polymerase. The RCA product with a long single stranded DNA could cause the formation of numerous hemin/G-quadruplex-based DNAzyme concatamers. With the assistance of nicking endonuclease, DNAzyme concatamers were dissociated from gold nanoparticle, which catalyzed the precipitation of 4-chloro-l-naphthol in the presence of H2O2 onto CdS nanorods-coated electrode (as the photoanode for the generated holes). The formed insoluble precipitate inhibited the electron transfer from the solution to CdS nanorods-modified electrode by using ascorbic acid as the electron donor. Under the optimum conditions, the photocurrent of the modified electrode decreased with the increasing of PSA concentration. A detectable concentration for target PSA with this system could be achieved as low as 1.8 pg mL(-1) In addition, our strategy also showed good reproducibility, high specificity and accuracy matched well with commercial PSA ELISA kits for real sample analysis. These remarkable properties revealed that the developed PEC immunoassay has great potential as a useful tool for the detection of PSA in practical application.

AB Since the nature of the exosomal lipid bilayer can allow miRNAs to be protected from degradation by cellular RNAses in body fluids, exosomal microRNA (miRNA) has become an ideal source of non-invasive biomarkers for the early diagnosis and prognosis. In this paper, a new surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) analysis strategy combining stable SERS reporter element and duplex-specific nuclease (DSN)-assisted signal amplification for quantitative detection of exosomal miRNA extracted from human blood is proposed. Firstly, we prepared SERS signal reporter of Au@R6G@AgAu nanoparticles (R6G attachment on the gold nanoparticles, then encapsulated in AgAu alloy shell nanoparticles named as ARANPs) with an inter small nanogap to generate stable SERS signal. Then, ARANPs and separating substrate of silicon microbead (SiMB) were then covalently attached to the 3'- and 5'- end of capture probe (CP) targeting exosomal miRNA. Upon target miRNA binding, DNA in heteroduplexes could be specifically cleaved by DSN and resulted in the release of ARANPs from the surface of SiMB. Meanwhile, target miRNA remained intact and subsequently involved in the next round of target-recycling amplification. The combination of stable SERS intensity and signal amplification significantly improved the sensitivity of the sensing systems, resulting in detection limits of 5 fM. More importantly, this method also could be used for the detection of exosomal miRNAs extracted from the blood collected from patients of recurrence in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), with a detection of 5.0 mu L of sample volume, which has potential for point-of-care testing (POCT) in clinical analysis.

AB In this paper, novel heparin-mimicking hyperbranched polyester nanoparticles (HBPE-SO3 NPs) with abundant of sulfonated acid functional groups were synthesized, and their antithrombogenicities were further evaluated. Further, a label-free electrochemical aptamer biosensor (aptasensor) based on HBPE-SO3 NPs modified electrode was developed for thrombin (TB) detection in whole blood. Meanwhile, the anti-biofouling properties of different modified electrodes were studied by whole blood and platelet adhesion test, hemolysis assay and morphological changes of red blood cells in vitro. Besides, the thrombin-binding aptamer was selected as receptor for the proposed aptasensor, which has excellent binding affinity and selectivity for TB. When binding to TB, the electron transfer taking place at the modified electrode interface was inhibited that can attribute to the stereo hindrance effect, resulting in the decreased current response. This aptasensor showed excellent electrochemical properties with a wide detection range and a low detection limit of 0.031 pM (S/N = 3), and provided high selectivity, long-term stability and good reproducibility. Finally, the sensitively detection of TB in whole blood samples directly was achieved by this aptasensor we proposed, which suggested its great potential for TB detection in the clinic.

AB A great body of evidence unveiled the existence of different stem cell types in various tissues with efficient capability for self-renewal and differentiation. Characterization and enumeration of a specific stem cell population seem difficult because these cells consist of a small percentage of cells within different milieu. As such, due to lack of accuracy provided by convenient methods, biosensing techniques are at the center of attention to improve stem cells characterization with high rate of sensitivity and specificity. In line with this statement, biosensing, as a sensitive analytical method, opens novel avenues in biological aspects. Physicochemical signals produced by the interaction of analyte-ligands could be applicable for a wide range of scientific fields such as chemical, biochemical, pharmaceutical and immunological purposes. Noninvasive and label free monitoring methods without need to stain, fix, lyse, or fluorescent-tags are desirable in basic stem cell technology and therapeutic applications of cells. We, here, highlighted basic concepts and terms associated with label free biosensor technology for measuring cell entity, evaluating cell surface marker, and peculiarly in the field of stem cell biology. Furthermore, different aspects and methodologies concerning with bio-sensing techniques, including photonic-based detection systems like Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) assays, Impedance-based method, Quartz Crystal Microbalance (QCM) and paper based detection of lateral flow biosensor (LFB) were discussed.

AB Herein, a novel electrochemiluminescence (ECL) biosensor was proposed for ultrasensitive detection of laminin (LN), in which DNA dendrimer (D) as a promising nanocarrier for luminophore and DNA nanomachine as tactic for target recycling. The DNA dendrimer was synthesized by hybridization between sense and its antisense Y-shaped DNAs which were formed via reaction between single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) with a thiol group at the 5'-end and a synthesized trimeric cross-linker of tris(2-maleimidoethyl)amine. This dendrimer provided abundant double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) to achieve high loading efficiency for ECL luminophore. Simultaneously, N-(aminobutyl)-N-(ethylisoluminol) (ABET) was conjugated with doxorubicin (Dox, a intercalator of dsDNA) to form the ECL indicator (Dox-ABEI) which could effectively intercalate DNA dendrimer to form the ECL probe (D-Dox-ABEI). Subsequently, a DNA nanomachine activated by target protein was involved to obtain numerous output ssDNA (S2) which was amplified by exonuclease III-assisted recycle and immobilized on ssDNA (S1)-modified sensing electrode surface via complementation. Thereby, abundant D-Dox-ABEI probes were captured by S2 to construct the biosensor for target protein detection. The proposed ECL biosensor realized the ultra sensitive detection of LN with a linear range from 0.1 pg/mL to 100 ng/mL and a low detection limit of 0.0661 pg/mL. Impressively, the application of this ECL biosensor would provide the great potential for analysis of other proteins, revealing a new avenue for early diagnosis and the prognosis evaluation of various diseases.

AB We developed a novel "signal-off" photoelectrochemical (PEC) aptasensor based on an aptamer bridged DNA network structure for the sensitive detection of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF(165)), using g-C3N4 as photoactive material. The DNA network provides an excellent platform for the immobilization of methylene blue (MB), which can facilitate the electron transport through the DNA helix structure and suppress the recombination of electron-hole pairs generated by g-C3N4. In the presence of the target VEGF(165), the DNA network can be destroyed adequately by the recognition between VEGF(165) and the aptamer, resulting in the release of MB. Therefore, the originally enhanced electron transfer process could be inhibited, leading to a remarkable decrease of the photocurrent. A good linear relationship between the PEC signal and the logarithm of vEGF(165) concentration over the range of 100 fM to 10 nM with a detection limit of 30 fM can be obtained. Our concept can be easily extended to develop aptasensors for the sensitive detection of different targets by triggering the release of the payloads from their corresponding aptamer bridged DNA networks.

AB A sandwich-configuration electrochemiluminescence (ECL) immunosensor based on Au star@BSA-Luminol nanocomposites for ultrasensitive determination of human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) has been developed. In this work, nanostructured Polyaniline hydrogels (Path) decorated with Pt nanoparticles (Pani/Pt) were utilized to construct the base of this immunosensor, greatly increasing the amount of loaded capture antibodies (Ab(1)) via linkage reagent glutaraldehyde (GA). The used conducting Pani/Pt nanocomposites possessed the unique features, such as large surface area, high electron transfer speed and favorable electrocatalytic activities of hydrogen peroxide, which offered a prominent platform for this sandwich-sensor and acted as efficient ECL signal amplifier also. Furthermore, we employed horseradish peroxidase (HRP) to block the nonspecific binding sites instead of commonly used bovine serum albumin (BSA), which further amplified the signal of luminol in the present of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). In addition, Au star@BSA nanocomposites with excellent water solubility, low-toxicity and great biocompatibility were prepared and used to immobilize HCG detection antibodies (Ab(2)) and luminescent material luminol. Then, the above-synthetized Luminol-Au star@BSA-Ab(2) complex was attached to the modified sensor by sandwiched immunoreactions. Under the optimized conditions, the proposed immunosensor exhibited a sensitive detection of HCG in a wide linear range from 0.001 to 500 mL(-1) with a detection limit of 0.0003 mIU/mL (S/N = 3). All the results indicated that such a sandwiched HCG immunosensor exhibited favorable ECL analytical performance. This developed method may be potentially used to recognize other clinical protein and display a novel ideal to construct an immunosensor.

AB Flexible epidermal tattoo and textile-based electrochemical biosensors have been developed for vapor-phase detection of organophosphorus (OP) nerve agents. These new wearable sensors, based on stretchable organophosphorus hydrolase (OPH) enzyme electrodes, are coupled with a fully integrated conformal flexible electronic interface that offers rapid and selective square-wave voltammetric detection of OP vapor threats and wireless data transmission to a mobile device. The epidermal tattoo and textile sensors display a good reproducibility (with RSD of 2.5% and 4.2%, respectively), along with good discrimination against potential interferences and linearity over the 90-300 mg/L range, with a sensitivity of 10.7 mu A.cm(3).mg(-1) (R-2 = 0.983) and detection limit of 12 mg/L in terms of OP air density. Stress-enduring inks, used for printing the electrode transducers, ensure resilience against mechanical deformations associated with textile and skin-based on-body sensing operations. Theoretical simulations are used to estimate the OP air density over the sensor surface. These fully integrated wearable wireless tattoo and textile-based nerve-agent vapor biosensor systems offer considerable promise for rapid warning regarding personal exposure to OP nerve-agent vapors in variety of decentralized security applications.

AB Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) renders profiling of genes of interest less time-consuming and cost-effective. Recently, multiplex profiling of miRNAs has enabled identifying or investigating predominant miRNAs for various diseases such as cancers and neurodegenerative diseases. Conventional multiplex qPCR technologies mostly use colorimetric measurements in solution phase, yet not only suffer from limited multiplexing capacity but also require target-screening processes due to non-specific binding between targets and primers. Here, we present hydrogel micropost-based qPCR for multiplex detection of miRNAs associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Our methodology promises two key advantages compared with the conventional solution-based PCR: 1) nearly no non-specific crosstalks between targets and primers, and 2) practically valuable multiplexing by spatial encoding within a single microchamber. Specifically, we immobilized hydrogel micro posts (similar to 400 mu m in diameter) within commercially available polycarbonate PCR chips by multi-step ultraviolet (UV, 365 nm) exposure. We optimized this photoimmobilization for thermal cycles of PCR as well. Acrylated forward primers incorporated in polyethylene glycol diacrylate (PEGDA) posts played a crucial role to confine fluorescent signal of cDNA amplification within the PEGDA hydrogel. To demonstrate the potential of our platform, we successfully verified multiplex detection of five miRNAs, which were reported to be highly correlated with AD, from a complex buffer of human plasma.

AB A rapid, sensitive and multiplexed imaging surface plasmon resonance (iSPR) biosensor assay was developed and validated for three Fusarium toxins, deoxynivalenol (DON), zearalenone (ZEA) and T-2 toxin. The iSPR assay was based on a competitive inhibition format with secondary antibodies (Ab(2)) conjugated to gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) used as a signal amplification tag. Signal was amplified nearly 25-fold for DON, 90-fold for ZEA and 12-fold for T-2 toxin assay using Ab(2)-AuNPs. Analyses, including steps to regenerate the sensor, took 17.5 min. The antigen coated sensor chip was used for more than 46 cycles without affecting signal intensity ( < 12%). Matrix matched calibration curves were used to determine Fusarium toxins in wheat. The mean recoveries ranged from 87% to 103% with relative standard deviations of repeatability of less than 5%. The limits of detection were 15 mu g/kg for DON, 24 mu g/kg for ZEA and 12 mu g/kg for T-2 toxin. This provided sufficient sensitivity to monitor contamination of these mycotoxins in wheat in accordance with. European Commission (EC) limits. Cut off levels for all three Fusarium toxins were validated using blank wheat and wheat spiked either at the EC regulated levels (100 mu g/kg for ZEA and T-2 toxin) or at one third of the EC level (for DON: 400 mu g/kg). The assay was successfully applied and further validated with naturally contaminated wheat samples. This is the first reported AuNP enhanced iSPR assay to detect and classify three agriculturally important Fusarium toxins in wheat.

AB We are presenting an electrochemical immunosensor for the determination of Galectin-3 (Gal-3), a biomarker of heart failure. A glassy carbon electrode (GCE) was modified with a film of a composite made from the N-doped graphene nanoribbons immobilized Fe-based-Metal-organic frameworks deposited with Au nanoparticles (N-GNRs-Fe-MOFs@AuNPs). Primary antibody against Gal-3 (Gal-3-Ab(1)) was immobilized on the Au nanoparticles on the surface of the modified GCE which then was blocked with bovine serum albumin. Signal amplification is crucial for obtaining low detection limits in biosensors. Here, a relatively simple and ultrasensitive sandwich type electrochemical immunosensor based on novel signal generation and amplification was developed for the determination of Gal-3. A kind of novel redox-active species, AuPt-Methylene blue (MB) (AuPt-MB) nano composites, was synthesized by a one-pot method for the first time. Wherein, MB as a kind of the electron transfer mediators in an amperometric biosensor is responsible for electron production and signal amplification. The rod-like AuPt-MB nanohybrids displayed uniform morphology and good electrochemical activity and can combine with the second antibodies against Gal-3 (Gal-3-Ab(2)). And the AuPt-MB-Ab(2) coupled with the N-GNRs-Fe-MOFs@AuNPs-Ab(1) to form the sandwich type format that can greatly enhance the biosensor's sensitivity. Under optimal conditions, the designed immunosensor exhibited a linear concentration range from 100 fg mL(-1) to 50 ng mL(-1), with a low detection limit of 33.33 fg mL(-1) (S/N = 3) for Gal-3 in spiked serum. Additionally, the designed immunosensor showed acceptable selectivity, reproducibility and stability. The satisfactory results in analyzing human serum samples indicated potential application promising in monitoring biomarkers.

AB In this study, a novel competition-type electrochemiluminescent (ECL) immunosensor for detecting diclofenac (DCF) was fabricated with graphene oxide coupled graphite-like carbon nitride (GO-g-C3N4) as signal probe for the first time. The ECL intensity of carboxylated g-C3N4 was significantly enhanced after being combined with graphene oxide (GO) which exhibited excellent charge-transport property. The sensing platform was constructed by multiwalled carbon nanotubes and gold nanoparticles (MWCNTs-AuNPs), which not only provided an effective matrix for immobilizing a large amount of coating antigen but also facilitated the electronic transmission rate to enhance the ECL intensity. Based on the synergistic effect of GO-g-C3N4 and MWCNTs-AuNPs composite, the proposed sensor showed high sensitivity, good stability, and wide linearity for the detection of DCF in the range of 0.005-1000 ng mL(-1) with a detection limit of 1.7 pg mL(-1). Furthermore, the developed immunoassay has been applied to real samples with satisfactory results. Therefore, this work provided a promising method for the detection of DCF and other small molecular compounds in the future.

AB A novel impedimetric biosensor was developed for the detection of the two extensively used pesticides, acetamiprid and atrazine. By employing the sputtering and e-beam lithography techniques, platinum nanoparticles (Pt NPs) were deposited in a bridge-like arrangement, in between interdigitated electrodes (IDEs). The resulting Pt NP microwires were chemically functionalized to allow the covalent immobilization of aptamers against the two target analytes onto the sensor surfaces. The biosensing platform facilitated charge transfer through the microwire-bridged IDEs, while upon analyte binding to the immobilized aptamers electron transfer was hindered, resulting in an increase of the electrochemical cell's impedance. The combination of Pt NPs microwires and aptamers allowed the sensitive and highly selective detection of acetamiprid with a linear range of response in the range of 10 pM to 100 nM with a limit of detection (LoD) at 1 pM, and of atrazine with a linear range of responses from 100 pM to 1 mu M and a LoD at 10 pM respectively. Its performance was tested against a number of other commonly used pesticides as well as in real water samples.

AB A crucial issue in microRNA (miRNA) detection is the lack of sensitive method capable of detecting the low levels of miRNA in RNA samples. Herein, we present a sensitive and specific method for the electrocatalytic detection of miR-107 using gold-loaded nanoporous superparamagnetic iron oxide nanocubes (Au-NPFe2O3NC). The target miRNA was directly adsorbed onto the gold surfaces of Au-NPFe2O3NC via gold-RNA affinity interaction. The electrocatalytic activity of Au-NPFe2O3NC was then used for the reduction of ruthenium hexaammine(Ill) chloride (RuHex, [Ru(NH3)(6)](3+)) bound with target miRNA. The catalytic signal was further amplified by using the ferri/ferrocyanide [Fe(CN)(6)](3-/4-) system. These multiple signal enhancement steps enable our assay to achieve the detection limit of 100 aM which is several orders of magnitudes better than most of the conventional miRNA sensors. The method was also successfully applied to detect miR-107 from cancer cell lines and a panel of tissue samples derived from patients with oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma with excellent reproducibility (% RSD = < 5%, for n = 3) and high specificity. The analytical accuracy of the method was validated with a standard RT-qPCR method. We believe that our method has the high translational potential for screening miRNAs in clinical samples.

AB Spinal muscular atrophy is an untreatable potentially fatal hereditary disorder caused by loss-of-function mutations in the survival motor neuron (SMN) 1 gene which encodes the SMN protein. Currently, definitive diagnosis relies on the demonstration of biallelic pathogenic variants in SMN1 gene. Therefore, there is an urgent unmet need to accurately quantify SMN protein levels for screening and therapeutic monitoring of symptomatic newborn and SMA patients, respectively. Here, we developed a voltammetric immunosensor for the sensitive detection of SMN protein based on covalently functionalized carbon nanofiber-modified screen printed electrodes. A comparative study of six different carbon nanomaterial-modified electrodes (carbon, graphene (G), graphene oxide (GO), single wall carbon nanotube (SWCNT), multi-wall carbon nanotube (MWCNT), and carbon nanofiber (CNF)) was performed. 4-carboxyphenyl layers were covalently grafted on the six electrodes by electroreduction of diazonium salt. Then, the terminal carboxylic moieties on the electrodes surfaces were utilized to immobilize the SMN antibody via EDC/NHS chemistry and to fabricate the immunosensors. The electrochemical characterization and analytical performance of the six immunosensors suggest that carbon nanofiber is a better electrode material for the SMN immunosensor. The voltammetric SMN carbon nanofiber-based immunosensor showed high sensitivity (detection limit of 0.75 pg/ml) and selectivity against other proteins such as cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) and dystrophin (DMD). We suggest that this novel biosensor is superior to other developed assays for SMN detection in terms of lower cost, higher sensitivity, simplicity and capability of high throughput screening.

AB In this work, a highly-efficient competitive method-based electrochemiluminescence (ECL) immunosensor was proposed based on {[Ru(bpy)(3)][Cu2xNi2(1 - x) (ox)(3)]}(n) (Cu/Ni/Ru) as luminophor to efficiently detect aflatoxins B1 (AFB1). Cu/Ni/Ru exhibited excellent ECL behavior. While polyethyleneitnine capped silicon dioxide (PEI@SiO2) could decrease the ECL performance of Cu/Ni/Ru due that PEI could destroy the structure of Cu/Ni/Ru via producing the complex between PEI and metal ions (Cu(II)/Ni(Il)), inducing the release of Ru(bpy)(3)(2+). Since Au nanoparticles can directly combine with antibody and antigen, the Cu/Ni/Ru and PEI@SiO2 was functionalized by Au nanoparticles. The quantitative detection of AFB1 was based on the competitive binding between AFB1-bovine serum albumin labeled Au-PEI@SiO2 (Au-PEI@SiO2-AFB1-BSA) and free AFB1 with antibody-AFB1 which immobilized on Au-Cu/Ni/Ru. The ECL signal increased with augmenting the concentrations of the free AFB1 due to less Au-PEI@SiO2-AFB1-BSA combining with antibodies. Under optimal conditions, the proposed immunosensor exhibited a wide linear range from 0.01 ng mL(-1) to 100 ng mL(-1) with a detection limit of 0.0039 ng mL(-1) (S/N = 3). The proposed immunosensor also provides a promising approach for ultrasensitive detection of other mycotoxins.

AB We designed an amplified detection strategy for the sensitive determination of lead ions (Pb2+) based on a target-triggered nuclear acid cleavage of Pb2+-specific DNAzyme as a selectivity interface combined with Pd-Pt alloys modified Fe-MOFs (Fe-MOFs/PdPt NPs) hybrids acting as the signal tag. Streptavidin modified reduced graphene oxide-tetraethylene pentamine-gold nanoparticles (rGO-TEPA-Au) served as a sensor platform for immobilizing more DNAzyme. In the presence of Pb2+, the substrate DNA strand can be specifically cleaved at the ribonucleotide site by DNAzyme to produce a new single-DNA on the interface. Then, the hairpin DNA with hybrid strand matched by its complement to the single-DNA was employed to modify the Fe-MOFs/PdPt NPs bioconjugates for signal amplification. Fe-MOFs/PdPt NPs catalyze hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) to produce the electrochemical signal which was recorded by chronoamperometry. Benefiting from the Pb2+-dependent DNAzyme, the proposed method can selectively detect Pb2+ in the presence of other metal ions. The newly designed biosensor exhibited a good linear relationship ranging from 0.005 to 1000 nmol L-1 with a low detection limit of 2 pM (S/N = 3) for Pb2+. This Pb2+-dependent DNAzyme based ultrasensitive biosensor showed high sensitivity and selectivity, providing potential application for Pb2+ detection in naturally contaminated sewage and spiked drinking water samples.

AB A new screen-printed carbon electrode (SPCE) with multiple working electrodes and one signal output channel without counter and reference electrodes was designed. The multiple working electrodes can be individually modified for each target of interest. The SPCE contained one signal output channel, making the immuniosensor be realized by common single-channel electrochemical workstation. The counter and reference electrodes were independent of disposable SPCE, reducing costs and eliminating precious metal pollution. Platinum network as counter electrode improved the reproducibility of the SPCE. Moreover, method of generating hydrogel on working electrode was used to enhance the conductivity of SPCE. Based on this, a multiplexed single channel label-free amperometric immuniosensor for four tumor markers, namely, squamous cell carcinoma antigen (SCCA), fragment antigen 21-1 (Cyfra21-1), carbohydrate antigen 125 (CA125), and neuron specific enolase (NSE) was developed, and the corresponding detection limits were 5.5 pg mL(-1), 4.8 pg mL(-1), 0.0054 U mL(-1) and 2.3 pg mL(-1), respectively. The sensitivity of this immunosensor was 0.83 mu A (Ig(ng mL-1))-1 for SCCA, 1.92 mu A (Ig(ng mL(-1)))-(1) for Cyfra21-1, 4.75 mu A (1g(U mL(-1)))(-1) for CA125 and 2.40 mu A (Ig(ng mL(-1)))(-1) for NSE. Among them, the sensitivities of CA125 and NSE were four-fold higher than those of the previous works.

AB Detecting heterogenic tumor cells that are traveling in our body through blood stream for the tumor metastasis is one way for cancer prognosis. Due to the heterogeneity of circulating tumor cells (CTCs), further identification of tumor cell types should be accompanied with CTCs isolation from blood cells in peripheral blood sample. Both negative enrichment and recollection of isolated CTCs are required in the downstream analysis, which are time-consuming, labor-intensive, and massive equipment required. To solve these limitations, we have developed a simple and disposable spiral shape microfluidic channel that can separate all CTCs from blood cells, and at the same time, can identify the types of CTCs based on epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM) expression level. Two different types of tumor cells, MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231, both from the same origin of breast carcinoma cells, were used to demonstrate the functionality of the developed system. The spiral channel system could capture the EpCAM positive and negative CTCs with 96.3% and 81.2% purity, respectively, while both EpCAM positive and negative CTCs were differently positioned along the microfluidic channel. The average selectivity of EpCAM positive and negative CTCs is 6.1:4.8. In addition, the throughput of the system was optimized at a sample flow rate of 150 mu l/min. The developed system successfully demonstrated its potential to identify biomarkers, including EpCAM, for detecting the heterogenic CTCs.

AB We demonstrate the three-dimensional (3D) interdigitated array (IDA) chip that operates without reference and counter electrodes, which are necessary components to apply enough potential to trigger the intended redox process, but used unwieldy for chip-based electrochemical detection. Using the electrode configuration, we propose a unique electrochemical system that is capable of controlling applied potential to a pair of working electrodes despite absence of reference and counter electrodes by fixing the electron transfer mediator on the electrodes in a microchannel. The electrochemical potential of the 2-electrode (2E) system is defined by the potential of the electron transfer mediator, poly(methylene green) (PMG), immobilized with poly(dopamine) (PDA) on the ITO surface by electropolymerization. The 3D IDA chip in the 2E system successfully acts as an electrochemical immunosensing platform. Creatine Kinase-MB in human serum was measured down to similar to pg/mL level. Therefore, the 3D IDA in the 2E system constitutes a simple and scalable platform that needs only nL level of sample volume for sensitive electrochemical detection in miniaturized multiplex immunoassay field.

AB The ability to directly detect double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) without sequence-preference continues to be a major challenge. Herein, we report an electrochemical method for the direct, highly sensitive detection of dsDNA based on the strand replacement of dsDNA by peptide nucleic acid (PNA) and the in situ growth of electroactive polymers through the surface-initiated electrochemically mediated atom transfer radical polymerization (SI-eATRP). Thiolated PNA molecules are firstly self-assembled onto gold electrode surface for the specific recognition of target dsDNA (dsDNA-T), which in turn leads to the formation of a high density of PNA/DNA heteroduplexes on the electrode surface for the subsequent attachment of ATRP initiators via the phosphate-Zr4+-carboxylate chemistry. By applying a negative potential to the electrode, the air-stable Cu-II deactivators can be reduced into the Cu-I activators so as to trigger the surface-initiated polymerization for the in situ growth of electroactive polymers. Due to the strand replacement of dsDNA by PNA, dsDNA can be directly detected without sequence-preference. Besides, the growth of polymers enables the modification of numerous electroactive probes, thereby greatly improving the electrochemical signal. Under optimal conditions, a good linearity between the electrochemical signal and the logarithm of dsDNA-T concentration over the range from 1.0 fM to 1.0 nM, with a detection limit of 0.47 fM, can be obtained. Results indicate that it is highly selective, and holds high anti-interference capability in the presence of human serum samples. Therefore, this method offers great promises in providing a universal and efficient solution for the direct detection of dsDNA.

AB In recent years photodynamic therapy (PDT) has received widespread attention in cancer treatment due to its smaller surgical trauma, better selectivity towards tumor cells, reduced side effects and possibility of repeatable treatment. Since cancer is the second cause of death worldwide, scientists constantly seek for new potential therapeutic agents including nanotechnology-based photosensitizers used in PDT. The new-designed nanostructures must be carefully studied and well characterized what require analytically useful and powerful tools that enable real progress in nanoscience development. This review describes the current status of PDT investigations using microfluidic Lab-on-a-Chip systems, including recent developments of nanoparticle-based PDT agents, their combinations with different drugs, designs and examples of in vitro applications. This review mainly lays emphasis on biological evaluation of FDA approved photosensitizing agents as well as newly designed nanophotosensitizers. It also highlights the analytical performances of various microfluidic Lab-on-a-chip systems for PDT efficacy analysis on 3D culture and discusses microsystems designs in detail.

AB We report here a versatile on-stage microfluidic cell culture and assay system which is compatible with different microscopes and sensors, can simultaneously perform steps of long term cell culture, high throughput time lapse cell assays/imaging, and cell micromanipulations. With the system, we cultured a variety of cells for different periods of time and monitored their cell morphology, migration and division. We also performed a series non-invasive real time in situ time lapse assays and micromanipulations on different cells. They include: the first time lapse imaging and measurements on the instantaneous variations of morphology, biomechanical properties and the intracellular protein of human red blood cells in responding to pH fluctuation, drug action and electromagnetic radiation; the first continuous time lapse Raman micro-spectroscopy on a CHO cell in different phases of its entire life cycles; the micro-tsansfection of GFP into B16 cells and the follow up observation of the cell's morphology and expressed GFP fluorescence varying with incubation time and cell generations. The performance of these experiments not only demonstrated the capability of the system, but also proposed a variety of novel methods for obtaining time- and spatially-resolved information about the cellular and molecular heterogeneity and transformation during development or stimulations.

AB Diffusometry is sensitive to geometric changes of particles. Target antigens can be detected through diffusivity changes resulting from their immunoreactions by functionalizing particle surface with a specific antibody. Considering that Brownian motion is a self-driven phenomenon, diffusometric immunosensing features several characteristics, such as no-washing steps, rapid detection, high flexibility, and high sensitivity. Until recently, this technique has been applied to many biomedical fields, such as monitoring of microorganism motility and diagnosis of diseases with biomarkers. Despite the abovementioned advantages, diffusivity changes in conventional diffusometry can be compromised at low-abundance antigens because proteins are much smaller than capture particles. To overcome such restriction, we present an improved diffusometric immunosensing technique by grafting additional gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) to capture particles to enhance size changes. A diabetic retinopathy (DR) biomarker, tumor necrosis factor-alpha was selected to evaluate the proposed immunosensing technique. Spherical AuNPs showed better enhancement than rod-like AuNPs during measurement. Limit of detection was improved by at least 100-fold down to 10 pg/mL. A dichotomous method was also developed to enable rapid detection and avoid tedious calibration. The relationship of concentrations between the two solutions used can be explicitly determined by comparing diffusivity of an unknown concentration of target molecules with that of a reference solution. Minimum discernible concentration reached as low as twofold higher or lower than basal concentration. Tear samples were collected from four volunteers, including three healthy subjects and one proliferative DR patient to prove the concept in diagnosis of the disease. All data showed good agreement with preset conditions. The technique eventually provides an insight into rapid diagnoses of diseases in the early stage.

AB We present a transparent and flexible self-charging biosupercapacitor based on an optimised mediator- and membrane-free enzymatic glucose/oxygen biofuel cell. Indium tin oxide (ITO) nanoparticles were spray-coated on transparent conducting ITO supports resulting in a flocculent, porous and nanostructured electrode surface. By this, high capacitive currents caused by an increased electrochemical double layer as well as enhanced catalytic currents due to a higher number of immobilised enzyme molecules were obtained. After a chemical pretreatment with a silane derivative, bilirubin oxidase from Myrothecium verrucaria was immobilized onto the ITO nanostructured electrode surface under formation of a biocathode, while bioanodes were obtained by either immobilisation of cellobiose dehydrogenase from Corynascus thermophilus or soluble PQQ-dependent glucose dehydrogenase from Acinetobacter calcoaceticus. The latter showed a lower apparent K-M value for glucose conversion and higher catalytic currents at mu M glucose concentrations. Applying the optimised device as a biosupercapacitor in a discontinuous charge/discharge mode led to a generated power output of 0.030 mW/cm(2) at 50 mu M glucose, simulating the glucose concentration in human tears. This represents an enhancement by a factor of 350 compared to the power density obtained from the continuously operating biofuel cell with a maximum power output of 0.086 mu W/cm(2) under the same conditions. After 17 h of charging/discharging cycles a remarkable current enhancement was still measured. The entire device was transferred to flexible materials and applied for powering a flexible display showing its potential applicability as an intermittent power source in smart contact lenses.

AB Adenine-functionalized spongy graphene (FSG) composite, fabricated via a facile and green synthetic method, has been explored as a potential electrocatalyst toward the electroanalytical sensing of codeine phosphate (COD). The synthesized composite is characterized using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), Raman spectroscopy, X-ray powder diffraction, UV-vis absorption spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), and thermogravimetric analysis. The FSG was electrically wired via modification upon screen-printed (macro electrode) sensors, which behave as a hybrid electrode material for the sensitive and selective codeine phosphate (COD) determination in the presence of paracetamol (PAR) and caffeine (CAF). The FSG- modified sensor showed an excellent electrocatalytic response towards the sensing of COD with a wide linear response range of 2.0 x 10(-8)-2.0 x 10(-4) M and a detection limit (LOD) of 5.8 x 10(-9) M, indicating its potential for the sensing of COD in clinical samples and pharmaceutical formulations.

AB A sensitive sandwich-type electrochemical immunosensor was developed for the detection of avian leukosis virus subgroup J (ALV-J), which benefitted from multiple signal amplification involving graphene-perylene-3,4,9,10-tetracarboxylic acid nanocomposites (GR-PTCA), nanocellulose-Au NP composites (NC-Au) and the alkaline phosphatase (ALP) catalytic reaction. GR-PTCA nanocomposites on glassy carbon electrodes served as the immunosensor platform. Due to their excellent electrical conductivity and abundant polycarboxylic sites, the GR-PTCA nanocomposites allowed fast electron transfer and good immobilization of primary antibodies, thereby affording a strong immunosensor signal in the presence of ALV-J. The detected signal could be further amplified by the introduction of NC-Au composites as a carrier of secondary antibodies (Ab(2)) and by harnessing the catalytic properties of Au and ALP. Under optimized testing conditions, the electrochemical immunosensor displayed excellent analytical performance for the detection of ALV-J, showing a linear current response from 10(2.08) to 10(4.0) TCID50/mL (TCID50: 50% tissue culture infective dose) with a low detection limit of 10(1.98) TCID50/mL (S/N = 3). In addition to high sensitivity, the immunosensor showed very good selectivity, reproducibility and operational stability, demonstrating potential application for the quantitative detection of ALV-J in clinical diagnosis.

AB A novel electrochemiluminescence (ECL) immunosensor for ultrasensitive detection of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) was developed using signal amplification strategy based on poly(5-formylindole)/reduced graphene oxide nanocomposite (P5FIn/erGO) and Au nanoparticle (AuNP) decorated graphene quantum dots (GQDs) (GQDs@AuNP). As an effective matrix for immobilization of primary antibody (Ab1), P5FIn/erGO nano composite facilitated the ion transport during the redox reactions and provided larger surface areas for the immobilization of Ab1. GQDs@AuNP was used as labels to conjugate with secondary antibody (Ab2), which improved electron transfer capability with stable ECL intensity. The multiple amplification of P5FIn/erGO and GQDs@AuNP made the ECL immunosensor have a broad linear range from 0.1 pg mL(-1) to 10 ng mL(-1) and a low detection limit with 3.78 fg mL(-1). In addition, this ECL immunosensor performed with admirable stability and good selectivity and reproducibility as well. When this immunosensor was used for the analysis of CEA in human serum, good recoveries were obtained. Thus, there will be a promising future in the early diagnosis of cancer to detect CEA.

AB This article demonstrates a new smartphone-based reusable glucose meter. The glucose meter includes a custom-built smartphone case that houses a permanent bare sensor strip, a stylus that is loaded with enzyme-carbon composite pellets, and sensor instrumentation circuits. A custom-designed Android-based software application was developed to enable easy and clear display of measured glucose concentration. A typical test involves the user loading the software, using the stylus to dispense an enzymatic pellet on top of the bare sensor strip affixed to the case, and then introducing the sample. The electronic module then acquires and wirelessly transmits the data to the application software to be displayed on the screen. The deployed pellet is then discarded to regain the fresh bare sensor surface. Such a unique working principle allows the system to overcome challenges faced by previously reported reusable sensors, such as enzyme degradation, leaching, and hysteresis effects. Studies reveal that the enzyme loaded in the pellets are stable for up to 8 months at ambient conditions, and generate reproducible sensor signals. The work illustrates the significance of the pellet-based sensing system towards realizing a reusable, point-of-care sensor that snugly fits around a smartphone and which does not face issues usually common to reusable sensors. The versatility of this system allows it to be easily modified to detect other analytes for application in a wide range of healthcare, environmental and defense domains.

AB We have constructed an aptamer immobilized gold atomic cluster mediated, ultrasensitive electrochemical biosensor (Apt/MAC/Au) for LPS detection without any additional signal amplification strategy. The aptamer self-assemble onto the gold atomic clusters makes Apt/AuAC/Au an excellent platform for the LPS detection. Differential pulse voltammetry and EIS were used for the quantitative LPS detection. The Apt/AuAC/Au sensor offers an ultrasensitive and selective detection of LPS down to 7.94 x 10(-21) M level with a wide dynamic range from 0.01 attomolar to 1 pM. The sensor exhibited excellent selectivity and stability. The real sample analysis was performed by spiking the diluted insulin sample with various concentration of LPS and obtained recovery within 2% error value. The sensor is found to be more sensitive than most of the literature reports. The simple and easy way of construction of this sensor provides an efficient and promising detection of an even trace amount of LPS.

AB In this work, a novel ultrasensitive electrochemical biosensor was developed for the detection of K562 cell by a signal amplification strategy based on multiple layer CdS QDs functionalized polystyrene microspheres(PS) as bioprobe and graphene oxide(GO) -polyaniline(PANI) composite as modified materials of capture electrode. Due to electrostatic force of different charge, CdS QDs were decorated on the surface of PS by PDDA (poly(diallyldimethyl-ammonium chloride)) through a layer-by-layer(LBL) assemble technology, in which the structure of multiple layer CdS QDs increased the detection signal intensity. Moreover, GO-PANT composite not only enhanced the electron transfer rate, but also increased tumor cells load ratio. The resulting electrochemical biosensor was used to detect K562 cells with a lower detection limit of 3 cells mL(-1) (S/N = 3) and a wider linear range from 10 to 1.0 x 10(7) cells mL(-1). This sensor was also used for mannosyl groups on HeLa cells and Hct116 cells, which showed high specificity and sensitivity. This signal amplification strategy would provide a novel approach for detection, diagnosis and treatment for tumor cells.

The fabricated electrode exhibited excellent catalytic activity toward the reaction of O-2 center dot(-) with a super low detection limit (LOD) of 2.530 x 10(-13) M (S/N = 3) and wide linear range of 8 orders of magnitude. It could fulfill the requirement of real-time measurement O-2 center dot(-) released from living cells. Furthermore, zymosan was chosen as the stimulant to induce O-2 center dot(-) generation from cancer cells (rat adrenal medulla pheochromocytoma cell (PC12)). The electrochemical experiment results indicated that the levels of intracellular O-2 center dot(-) depended on the amount of Zymosan. A large amount of 02"- generated in the living cells by added heavy stimulant could damage cells seriously. More importantly, a vitro simulation experiment confirmed the role of superoxide dismutase (SOD) for the first time because it could maintain the O-2 center dot(-) concentration at a normal physiological range. These findings are of great significance for evaluating the metabolic processes of O-2 center dot(-) in the biological system, and this work has the tremendous potential application in clinical diagnostics to assess oxidative stress.

AB In this paper, a trimetallic Pd@Au@Pt nanocomposites platform on-COOH terminated reduced graphene oxide (COOH-rGO) was newly developed for sensing carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and prostate specific antigen (PSA) biomarkers. Trimetallic electro-catalytic surfaces were prepared by the electrodeposition of noble metals (Pd@Au@Pt) nanoparticles on COOH- rGO. After EDC/NHS treatment, the anti-CEA and anti-PSA were immobilized separately on two different platforms. Under optimized conditions, the platforms were analyzed by cyclic voltammetry and differential pulse voltammetry (DPV). The platform shows good electro catalytic activity, high sensitivity, and acceptable stability for sensing CEA and PSA biomarkers. For CEA, we obtained sensitivity of 0.099 +/- 0.007 mu A ng(-1) ml, wide linear range from 12 pg ml(-1) to 85 ng ml(-1) and a limit of detection (LOD) of 8 pg ml(-1), while for PSA sensitivity is 0.267 +/- 0.02 mu A ng(-1) ml, wide linear range from 3 pg ml(-1) to 60 ng ml(-1) and LOD of 2 pg ml(-1). The validation of the platform was observed through standard addition method. Thus, the sensing platform could be used for the point of care detection of CEA and PSA.

AB Electrochemiluminescence (ECL) co-reaction and ECL resonance energy transfer (ECL-RET) are two main methods for enhancing the ECL efficiency. In this work, a novel tris(bipyridine) ruthenium(II) derivative (Ru(bPY)(2)(mcbpy)(2+)-PEI-ABEI) with high ECL efficiency due to the binary intramolecular ECL self-catalyzed property including intramolecular co-reaction and intramolecular ECL-RET, was prepared for the construction of immunosensor. Firstly, through intramolecular co-reaction, polyethyleneimine (PEI) with large amount of amine co-reactive groups (primary, secondary and tertiary amine) not only increased the ECL intensity of Ru(bpy)(2)(mcbpy)(2+), but also improved the ECL signal of N-(aminobutyl)-N-(ethylisoluminol) (ABEI). Meanwhile, ABEL as an effective energy transfer donor, could further increase the ECL intensity of Ru(bPY)(2)(mcbpy)(2+) (as energy transfer receptor) by intramolecular ECL-RET. It is worth noting that the strategy combined intramolecular co-reaction and intramolecular ECL-RET in the same ECL process was more effective for ECL efficiency enhancement compared with the traditional intermolecular interaction or individual intramolecular interaction, which would improve the sensitivity of immunosensor obviously. Thus, the proposed signal-on ECL immunosensor using convex hexoctahedral Pd@Au core-shell nanocrystals (Pd-Au HCDs) as immobilized platform exhibited a detected range for collagen type IV (Col IV), a typical biomarker of diabetic nephropathy (DN), from 0.5 pg mL(-1) to 7.2 ng mL(-1) with an estimated detection limit of 0.17 pg mL(-1). The developed strategy combined intramolecular co-reaction with intramolecular ECL-RET offered an effective mean for ECL methodology in ECL efficency enhancement and also provided possible road for early diagnosis and treatment monitoring of DN.

AB Graphene quantum dot (GQD) has been attractive in analytical science field due to its low toxicity, stable photoluminescence. Herein, nitrogen-doped GQD (N-GQD) was prepared by a facile solvothermal treatment of GO using dimethylformamide, and exhibited a green emission with 23.1% quantum yield. The N-GQD probe showed a selective and sensitive fluorescence enhancement response to Al3+, the mechanism might be the formation of a complex between Al3+ and N-GQD constrained the photo-induced electron transfer (PET) process of N-GQD itself. With Benesi-Hildebrand equation, the binding constant and molar ratio between N-GQD and Al3+ was calculated to be 4.6 x 10(4) L mol(-1) and 1:1 respectively. The pK(a) value of N-GQD was also determined to be 4.4 by capillary electrophoresis. In pH 4.0 PBS solution, there was a good linear relation between the fluorescence intensity and the logarithm of concentration of Al3+ in the range of 2.5-75 mu mol L-1, the limit of detection (3 sigma) was 1.3 mu mol L-1. This "Off - On" fluorescence method had been applied to accurate quantification of aluminum in hydrotalcite tablets. What's more, the fluorescence switch property of N-GQD was explored by alternate addition of Al3+ and EDTA. The probe was also utilized for detection Al3+ in living cells due to its excellent biocompatibility.

AB Molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs)-based electrochemical biosensors (ECBSs) have many advantages from MIPs and ECBSs, such as high selectivity and sensitivity, chemical/mechanical stability, reusability, low limit of detection, facile preparation and low cost. MIPs-based ECBSs attract much attention in medical diagnose, biological analysis, environmental monitoring, food safety evaluation, etc. Due to the capacity of highly specific recognition for target biomolecules, MIPs-based ECBSs have been smartly designed and extensively used for electrochemical sensing applications in recent years, exhibiting obvious superiority over other analytical techniques. In this review, firstly we systematically summarize the recent advances of MIPs-based ECBSs reported in recent years, referring to the preparation, structures and components of sensing systems. Secondly, we highlight the sensing applications for various significant biomolecules (proteins, antibiotics, pesticide, neurotransmitter, hormone, etc.), and demonstrate the sensing mechanism and detection performance. Finally, the rational summaries, present challenges and future prospects in the field of MIPs-based ECBSs have been discussed reasonably.

AB As a new member of the carbon quantum-dot family, fluorescent nitrogen-rich quantum dots (NRQDs) were prepared by a mixed solvothermal method using 2-azidoimidazole and aqueous ammonia as reactants. These NRQDs are rich in nitrogen up to 40.2%, which are endowed with high fluorescence quantum yield, good photostability, water-solubility and favourable biocompatibility. We further explored the use of NRQDs combined with Cu2+ as a nanoprobe for sensing fluorescently of cysteine (Cys) in complex biological samples. In this sensing system, the fluorescence is significantly quenched via energy transfer from NRQDs to Cu2+ for the coordination of amino-containing groups with Cu2+. The strong affinity between Cu2+ and Cys leads to the formation of Cu2+-Cys complexes and cause the detachment of Cu2+ from the surface of NRQDs, thus the fluorescence of NRQDs recover. This nanoprobe allows analysis of Cys by modulating the switch of the fluorescence of NRQDs with a detection limit of 5.3 nM. As expected, the proposed NRQDs-Cu(2+)complex-based nanoprobes were successfully applied for the determination of Cys in human serum and plasma samples with recoveries ranging from 97.2% to 105.7%. The probe ensemble was also successfully applied to imaging of Cys in living cells with satisfactory results, which shows strong potential for clinical diagnosis.

AB We have developed a cost-effective and portable graphene-enabled biosensor to detect Zika virus with a highly specific immobilized monoclonal antibody. Field Effect Biosensing (FEB) with monoclonal antibodies covalently linked to graphene enables real-time, quantitative detection of native Zika viral (ZIKV) antigens. The percent change in capacitance in response to doses of antigen (ZIKV NS1) coincides with levels of clinical significance with detection of antigen in buffer at concentrations as low as 450 pM. Potential diagnostic applications were demonstrated by measuring Zika antigen in a simulated human serum. Selectivity was validated using Japanese Encephalitis NS1, a homologous and potentially cross-reactive viral antigen. Further, the graphene platform can simultaneously provide the advanced quantitative data of nonclinical biophysical kinetics tools, making it adaptable to both clinical research and possible diagnostic applications. The speed, sensitivity, and selectivity of this first-of-its-kind graphene-enabled Zika biosensor make it an ideal candidate for development as a medical diagnostic test.

AB Diagnostic systems that can deliver highly specific and sensitive detection of hepatitis A virus (HAV) in food and water are of particular interest in many fields including food safety, biosecurity and control of outbreaks. Our aim was the development of an electrochemical method based on DNA hybridization to detect HAV. A ssDNA probe specific for HAV (capture probe) was designed and tested on DNAs from various viral and bacterial samples using Nested-Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (nRT-PCR). To develop the electrochemical device, a disposable gold electrode was functionalized with the specific capture probe and tested on complementary ssDNA and on HAV cDNA. The DNA hybridization on the electrode was measured through the monitoring of the oxidative peak potential of the indicator tripropylamine by cyclic voltammetry. To prevent non-specific binding the gold surface was treated with 3% BSA before detection. High resolution atomic force microscopy (AFM) confirmed the efficiency of electrode functionalization and on-electrode hybridization. The proposed device showed a limit of detection of 0.65 pM for the complementary ssDNA and 6.94 fg/mu L, for viral cDNA. For a comparison, nRT-PCR quantified the target HAV cDNA with a limit of detection of 6.4 fg/mu L. The DNA-sensor developed can be adapted to a portable format to be adopted as an easy-to-use and low cost method for screening HAV in contaminated food and water. In addition, it can be useful for rapid control of HAV infections as it takes only a few minutes to provide the results.

AB Outbreaks of foodborne diseases have become a global health concern; hence, many improvements and developments have been made to reduce the risk of food contamination. We developed a centrifugal microfluidic automatic wireless endpoint detection system integrated with loop mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) for monoplex pathogen detection. Six identical sets were designed on the microfluidic compact disc (CD) to perform 30 genetic analyses of three different species of foodborne pathogens. The consecutive loading, mixing, and aliquoting of the LAMP primers/reagents and DNA sample solutions were accomplished using an optimized square-wave microchannel, metering chambers and revulsion per minute (RPM) control. We tested 24 strains of pathogenic bacteria (Escherichia colt, Salmonella spp and Vibrio cholerae), with 8 strains of each bacterium, and performed DNA amplification on the microfluidic CD for 60 min. Then, the amplicons of the LAMP reaction were detected using the calcein colorimetric method and further analysed via the developed electronic system interfaced with Bluetooth wireless technology to transmit the results to a smartphone. The system showed a limit of detection (LOD) of 3 x 10(-5) ng mu L-1 DNA by analysing the colour change when tested with chicken meat spiked with the three pathogenic bacteria. Since the entire process was performed in a fully automated way and was easy to use, our microdevice is suitable for point-of-care (POC) testing with high simplicity, providing affordability and accessibility even to poor, resource-limited settings.

AB Monitoring and determination of ultra-trace concentrations of monoamine neurotransmitter such as noradrenaline (NA) in living cells with simple, sensitive and selective assays are significantly interesting. We design NA-electrode sensing system based on C-, N-doped NiO broccoli-like hierarchy (CNNB). The spherical broccoli head umbrella architectures associated with nano-tubular arrangements enabled to tailor NA biosensor design. The homogenous doping and anisotropic dispersion of CN nanospheres along the entire NB head nanotubes lead to creating of abundant electroactive sites in the interior tubular vessels and outer surfaces for ultrasensitive detection of NA in living cells such as PC12. The CNNB biosensor electrodes showed efficient electrocatalytic activity, enhanced kinetics for electrooxidation of NA, and fast electron-transfer between electrode electrolyte interface surfaces, enabling synergistic enhancement in sensitivity, and selectivity at a low-detectable concentration of similar to 6 nM and reproducibility of broccoli-shaped NA-electrodes. The integrated CNNB biosensor electrodes showed evidence of monitoring and screening of NA released from PC12 cells under ion-extracellular stimulation process. The unique features of CNNB in terms of NA-selectivity among multi competitive components, long-term stability during the detection of NA may open their practical, in-vitro application for extracellular monoamine neurotransmitters detection in living cells.

AB A novel, label-free and convenient strategy for thrombin assay has been developed based on the fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) from a cationic conjugated polymer (CCP) to Ir(III) complex. The energy donor (CCP) and acceptor (Ir(III) complex) were taken into close proximity through pi-pi stacking interaction and electrostatic interaction, leading to the occurrence of FRET. However, the introduction of the thrombin aptamer upset the status and blocked the FRET process, but afterwards the reappearance of FRET phenomenon was confirmed by the special binding interaction between aptamer and thrombin, thus achieving the quantitative detection of thrombin. This assay could detect thrombin as low concentration as about 0.05 pM and provided a highly specific selectivity among other nonspecific proteins. Moreover, the strategy may allow our platform to provide similar sensitivity toward different targets in an aptamer-structure-independent manner. Furthermore, the assay can be used to detect thrombin in diluted real urine or serum samples with a satisfactory recovery, implying its great potential for rapid detection of thrombin in the clinic.

AB Fiber optics evanescent field based biosensor is an excellent candidate for label-free detection of cardiac biomarkers which is of great importance in rapid, early, and accurate diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction (AMI). In this paper, we report a compact and sensitive cardiac troponin I (cTn-I) immunosensor based on the phase-shifted microfiber Bragg grating probe which is functionalized. The fine reflective signal induced by the phase shift in modulation significantly improves the spectral resolution, enabling the ability of the sensor in perceiving an ultra-small refractive index change due to the specific capture of the cTn-I antigens. In buffer, a log-linear sensing range from 0.1 to 10 ng/mL and a limit of detection (LOD) of 0.03 ng/mL (predicted to be as low as 10.8 pg/mL) are obtained. Furthermore, with good specificity, the sensor can be applied in test of cTh-I in human serum samples. The proposed sensor presents superiorities such as improved integratability and portability, easy fabrication and operation, and intrinsic compatibility to the fiber-optic network, and thus has a promising prospect in "point-of-care" test for cardiac biomarkers and preclinical diagnosis.

AB We herein describe novel amine-grafted metal organic frameworks (MOFs) as a promising alternative to natural peroxidase enzyme and their applications for a fluorescent assay of choline (Cho) and acetylcholine (ACh). Among diverse amine-functionalized MOFs, N,N,N',N'-tetramethyl-1,4-butanediamine (TMBDA)-functionalized MIL-100(Fe) (TMBDA-MIL-100(Fe)) exhibited the highest peroxidase activity by developing intense fluorescence from Amplex UltraRed (AUR) in the presence of H2O2, which was presumably due to the synergetic effect of the enhanced negative potential and precisely controlled molecular size of the grafted diamine. Based on the excellent peroxidase-like activity of TMBDA-MIL-100(Fe), choline and ACh were reliably determined down to 0.027 and 0.036 mu M, respectively. Furthermore, practical applicability of this strategy was successfully demonstrated by detecting choline and ACh in spiked samples of milk and serum, respectively. This work highlights the advantages of amine-grafted MOFs for the preparation of biomimetic catalysts, extending their scope to biosensor applications.

AB A novel immunosensor for detecting Newcastle disease virus (NDV) was developed using excessively tilted fiber grating (Ex-TFG) coated with gold nanospheres (AuNs). AuNs were coated on the Ex-TFG surface via Au-S bonds using 3-mercaptopropyltrimethoxysilane (MPTMS), and the activated staphylococcal protein A (SPA) was linked to AuNs by covalent bonds via cysteamine. AuNs greatly enhanced the impact of the analyte on the fiber cladding mode through the local surface Plasmon resonance (LSPR) effect, thus improving the detection limit and sensitivity of the immunosensor. Meanwhile, SPA enhanced the bioactivity of anti-NDV monoclonal antibodies (MAbs), thus promoting the effectiveness of specific binding events on the fiber surface. Immunoassays were performed by monitoring the resonance wavelength shift of the proposed sensor under NDV samples containing different particle amounts. Specificity was assessed, and clinical tests for NDV were performed by contrast experiments. Experimental results showed that the detection limit for NDV was about 5 similar to 10 times improved compared to that of reference Ex-TFG without AuN treatment. Moreover, the novel biosensor was reusable and could potentially be applied in clinic.

AB A simple electrochemical strategy is reported for continuous monitoring of dynamic DNA methylation process over time. An electrochemical sensor was prepared by co-assembling of DNA probe and 6-mercapto-l-hexanol onto a gold electrode. The top of the DNA probe was labeled with 6-ferrocenylhexanethiol modified gold nanoparticle. The charge density between the C center dot G base pair was verified to be slightly reduced by DNA methylation, and could be further decelerated by similar to 25% upon co-locating a Br group onto methylated cytosine (mC). Therefore, in the presence of NaIO4/LiBr, the progressively methylated DNA on the sensor showed a clearly decreasing current over methylation time. The dynamic DNA methylation process was indicated continuously from the current decrease ratio, with a limit of detection of 0.0372 mu M. The strategy is convenient, cost-effective, and enable continuous profiling methylation process without distortion. Besides, the strategy was successfully applied for the studies on inhibitor screening and flanking sequence preference of DNA methyltransferase 3a. The results show that the activity of DNA methyltransferase 3a can be mildly inhibited by epigallocatechin gallate, and varies towards different flanking sequence with an order of 5'-CCGG-3' < 5'-CGCG-3' < 5'-CGCA-3'.

AB Supramolecular nanoparticle hybrids for biosensing of analytes have been a major focus due to their tunable optical and surface properties. Quantum dots-Gold nanoparticle (QDs-GNP) based FRET probes involving turn on/off principles have gained immense interest due to their specificity and sensitivity. Recent focus is on applying these supramolecular hybrids for enzyme operated biosensors that can specifically turn-on fluorescence induced by co-factor or product formed from enzymatic reaction. The present study focuses on locking and unlocking the interaction between QD-GNP pair leading to differential fluorescent properties. Cationic GNPs efficiently quenched the anionic QD fluorescence by forming nanoparticle hybrid. Quenching interaction between QD-GNP pair was unlocked by NADH leading to QD fluorescence turn-on. This phenomenon was applied for the successful detection of formaldehyde using NAD+ dependent formaldehyde dehydrogenase. The proposed nano-sniffer could successfully detect formaldehyde from 0.001 to 100000 ng/mL (R-2 = 0.9339) by the turn off-turn on principle. It could also detect formaldehyde in fruit juice and wine samples indicating its stability and sensitivity in real samples. The proposed nanoprobe can have wide applications in developing enzyme biosensors in future.

AB A new paper-based lateral flow immunoassay configuration was engineered and investigated. The assay is intended for the detection of a model protein in human serum, that is, human immunoglobulin G, with the aim to demonstrate a virtually universal protein detection platform. Once the sample is added in the strip, the analyte is selectively captured by antibody-decorated silica beads (Ab-SiO2) onto the conjugate pad and the sample flows by capillarity throughout the strip until reaching the test line, where a sandwich-like immunocomplex takes place due to the presence of antibody-functionalized QDs (Ab-QDs) onto the test line. Eventually, GO is added as a revealing agent and the photoluminescence of those sites protected by the complex Ab-SiO2/Antigen/Ab-QDs will not be quenched, whereas those photoluminescent sites directly exposed are expected to be quenched by GO, including the control line, made of bare QDs, reporting that the assay occurred successfully. Hence, the photoluminescence of the test line is modulated by the formation of sandwich-like immunocomplexes. The proposed device achieves a limit of detection (LOD) of 1.35 ng mL(-1) in standard buffer, which is lower when compared with conventional lateral flow technology reported by gold nanoparticles, including other amplification strategies. Moreover, the resulting device was proven useful in human serum analysis, achieving a LOD of 6.30 ng mL(-1) in this complex matrix. This low-cost disposable and easy-to-use device will prove valuable for portable and automated diagnostics applications, and can be easily transferred to other analytes such as clinically relevant protein biomarkers.

AB Triglycerides (TGs) are the major transporters of dietary fats throughout the bloodstream. Besides transporting fat, TGs also act as stored fat in adipose tissue, which is utilized during insufficient carbohydrates supply. TG level is below 150 mg/dL in healthy persons. Elevated TGs level in blood over 500 mg/dL is a biomarker for cardiovascular diseases, Alzheimer disease, pancreatitis and diabetes. Numerous methods are accessible for recognition of TGs, among them, most are cumbersome, time-consuming, require sample pre-treatment, high cost instrumental set-up and experienced personnel to operate. Biosensing approach overcomes these disadvantages, as these are highly specific, fast, easy, cost effective, and highly sensitive. This review article describes the classification, operating principles, merits and demerits of TG biosensors, specifically nanomaterials based biosensors. TG biosensors work ideally within 2.5-2700 s, in pH range, 6.0-11.0, temperature 25-39.5 degrees C and TG concentration range, 0.001-100 mM, the detection limits being in the range, 0.1 nM to 0.56 mM, with working potential - 0.02 to 1.2 V. These biosensors measured TG level in fruit juices, beverages, sera and urine samples and reused upto 200 times over a period of 7-240 days, while stored dry at 4 degrees C. Future perspective for further improvement and commercialization of TG biosensors are discussed.

AB Early detection, diagnosis and treatment of human immune deficiency virus (HIV) infection is the key to reduce acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) mortality. In our research, an innovative surface plasmon resonance (SPR) biosensing strategy has been developed for highly sensitive detection of HIV-related DNA based on entropy-driven strand displacement reactions (ESDRs) and double-layer DNA tetrahedrons (DDTs). ESDRs as enzyme-free and label-free signal amplification circuit can be specifically triggered by target DNA, leading to the cyclic utilization of target DNA and the formation of plentiful double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) products. Subsequently, the dsDNA products bind to the immobilized hairpin capture probes and further combine with DDTs nanostructures. Due to the high efficiency of ESDRs and large molecular weight of DDTs, the SPR response signal was enhanced dramatically. The proposed SPR biosensor could detect target DNA sensitively and specifically in a linear range from 1 pM to 150 nM with a detection limit of 48 fM. In addition, the whole detecting process can be accomplished in 60 min with high accuracy and duplicability. In particular, the developed SPR biosensor was successfully used to analyze target DNA in complex biological sample, indicating that the developed strategy is promising for rapid and early clinical diagnosis of HIV infection.

AB In this study, an organic electrochemical transistor sensor (OECT) with a molecularly imprinted, polymer (MIP)-modified gate electrode was prepared for the detection of ascorbic acid (AA). The combination of the amplification function of an OECT and the selective specificity of MIPs afforded a highly sensitive, selective OECT sensor. Cyclic voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurements were carried out to monitor the stepwise fabrication of the modified electrodes and the adsorption capacity of the MIP/Au electrodes. Atomic force microscopy was employed for examining the surface morphology of the electrodes. Important detection parameters, pH and detection temperature were optimized. With the change in the relative concentration of AA from 1 mu M to 100 mu M, the MIP-OECT sensor exhibited a low detection limit of 10 nM (S/N > 3) and a sensitivity of 75.3 mu A channel current change per decade under optimal conditions. In addition, the MIP-OECT sensor exhibited excellent specific recognition ability to AA, which prevented the interference from other structurally similar compounds (e.g., aspartic acid, glucose, uric acid, glycine, glutathione, H2O2), and common metal ions (K+, Na+ Ca2+, Mg2+, and Fe2+). In addition, a series of vitamin C beverages were analyzed to demonstrate the feasibility of the MIP-OECT sensor. Using the proposed principle, several other sensors with improved performance can be constructed via the modification of organic electrochemical transistors with appropriate MIP films.

AB The nanoparticles (NPs) aggregates of commercial urease from jack beans (Canavalia ensiformis) were prepared by desolvation and glutaraldehyde crosslinking and functionalized by cysteamine dihydrochloride. These enzyme nanoparticles (ENPs) were characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), UV and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. The TEM images of urease NPs showed their size in the range, 18-100 nm with an average of 51.2 nm. The ENPs were more active and stable with a longer shelf life than native enzyme molecules. The ENPs were immobilized onto chitosan (CHIT) activated nitrocellulose (NC) membrane via glutaraldehyde coupling with 32.22% retention of initial activity of free urease NPs with a conjugation yield of 1.63 mg/cm(2). This NC membrane was mounted at the lower/sensitive end of the ammonium ion selective electrode (AISE) with O-ring and then electrode was connected to a digital pH meter to construct a potentiometric urea biosensor. The biosensor exhibited optimum response within 10 s at pH 5.5 and 40 degrees C. The biosensor was employed for measurement of potentiometric determination of urea in sera of apparently healthy and persons suffering from kidney disorders. The biosensor displayed a low detection limit of 1 mu M/L with a wide working range of 2-80 mu M/L (0.002-0.08 mM) and sensitivity of 23 mV/decade. The analytical recovery of added urea in serum was 106.33%. The within and between-batch coefficient of variations (CVs) of present biosensor were 0.18% and 0.32% respectively. There was a good correlation (r = 0.99) between sera urea values obtained by reference method (Enzymic colorimetric kit method) and the present biosensor. The biosensor had negligible interference from Na+,K+,NH+4 and Ca2+ but Mg2+,Cu2+ and ascorbic acid but had slight interference, which was overcome by specific ion selective electrode. The ENPs bound NC membrane was used maximally 8-9 times per day over a period of 180 days, when stored in 0.01 M sodium acetate buffer pH 5.5 at 4 degrees C.

AB By means of molecular imprinting of a conducting polymer, molecular cavities selective for oxytocin nonapeptide, an autism biomarker, were designed. Embedding of the oxytocin template, and then its extracting from the molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP) was confirmed by the XPS analysis. AFM imaging of the MIP film surface indicated changes in mechanical properties of the film after template extraction. The MIP synthetic receptor was deposited by potentiodynamic electropolymerization as a thin film on an Au film electrode in an electrochemical miniaturized microfluidic cell. The use of this cell allowed to shorten analysis time and to decrease the sample volume. The linear dynamic concentration range extended from 0.06 to 1 mM with the limit of detection of 60 mu M (S/N = 3). Advantageously, sensitivity of the diagnostic microfluidic platform devised for oxytocin determination in both synthetic serum samples and in aqueous solutions was similar and, moreover, it was selective to common interferences, such as oxytocin analogs and potential metabolites.

AB Tuberculosis is one of the major public health concerns. This highly contagious disease affects more than 10.4 million people, being a leading cause of morbidity by infection. Tuberculosis is diagnosed at the point-of-care by the Ziehl-Neelsen sputum smear microscopy test. Ziehl-Neelsen is laborious, prone to human error and infection risk, with a limit of detection of 10(4) cells/mL. In resource-poor nations, a more practical test, with lower detection limit, is paramount. This work uses a magnetoresistive biosensor to detect BCG bacteria for tuberculosis diagnosis. Herein we report: i) nanoparticle assembly method and specificity for tuberculosis detection; ii) demonstration of proportionality between BCG cell concentration and magnetoresistive voltage signal; application of multiplicative signal correction for systematic effects removal; iv) investigation of calibration effectiveness using chemometrics methods; and v) comparison with state-of-the-art point-of-care tuberculosis biosensors.
   Results present a clear correspondence between voltage signal and cell concentration. Multiplicative signal correction removes baseline shifts within and between biochip sensors, allowing accurate and precise voltage signal between different biochips. The corrected signal was used for multivariate regression models, which significantly decreased the calibration standard error from 0.50 to 0.03 log(10) (cells/mL). Results show that Ziehl-Neelsen detection limits and below are achievable with the magnetoresistive biochip, when pre-processing and chemometrics are used.

AB Electrochemiluminescent (ECL) assay has gradually drawn increasing interest in the biomedical analysis. This paper proposed a new methodology for ultrasensitive and facile detection of Alzheimer's disease marker beta-amyloid (A beta ) by fabricating a sandwich-type ECL sensing platform. Herein, electrochemiluminescence resonance energy transfer (ECL-RET) was employed to determine A beta concentration, which can be attributed to the quenching effect from RET between Ru(bpy)(3)(2+) and gold nanorods (GNRs) acting as ECL-RET electron donor and acceptor, respectively. In this protocol, mesoporous carbon nanospheres were adopted to immobilize ECL reactant Ru(bpy)(3)(2+) and antibody via nafion to acquire the RET donor nanocomposites (MOCs/nafion/ Ru(bpy)(3)(2+)-/antibody), which were tightly interconnected with epoxy group functionalized Fe3O4 nanoparticles. It is of vital importance that GNRs with exquisite rod shape were synthesized and exhibited a typical absorption peak at 650 nm to quench ECL signal of Ru(bpy)(3)(2+) effectively. In addition, the ECL emission decreased linearly with the logarithm of A beta concentration in a wide linear range from 1.0 x 10(-5) to 100 ng/mL with a detection limit of 4.2 x 10(-6) ng/mL. Furthermore, distinctive and desirable properties were verified to declare the promise for being applicable to analyze the A beta content in real Alzheimer's cerebrospinal fluid samples with satisfactory results.

AB A novel competitive aptasensor for thrombin detection is developed by using a tetrahedral DNA (T-DNA) probe and hybridization chain reaction (HCR) signal amplification. Sulfur and nitrogen co-doped reduced graphene oxide (SN-rGO) is firstly prepared by a simple reflux method and used for supporting substrate of biosensor. Then, T-DNA probe is modified on the electrode by Au-S bond and a competition is happened between target thrombin and the complementary DNA (cDNA) of aptamer. The aptamer binding to thrombin forms an aptamertarget conjugate and make the cDNA remained, and subsequently hybridizes with the vertical domain of T-DNA. Finally, the cDNAs trigger HCR, which results in a great current response by the catalysis of horseradish peroxidase to the hydrogen peroxide + hydroquinone system. For thrombin detection, the proposed biosensor shows a wide linearity range of 10(-13)-10(-8) M and a low detection limit of 11.6 fM (S/N = 3), which is hopeful to apply in biotechnology and clinical diagnosis.

AB In this study, we report the development of a high sensitivity assay for the detection of cardiac troponin I using electrical double layer gated high field AlGaN/GaN HEMT biosensor. The unique gating mechanism overcomes the drawback of charge screening seen in traditional FET based biosensors, allowing detection of target proteins in physiological solutions without sample processing steps. Troponin I specific antibody and aptamer are used as receptors. The tests carried out using purified protein solution and clinical serum samples depict high sensitivity, specificity and wide dynamic range (0.006-148 ng/mL). No additional wash or sample pretreatment steps are required, which greatly simplifies the biosensor system. The miniaturized HEMT chip, is packaged in a polymer substrate and easily integrated with a portable measurement unit, to carry out quantitative troponin I detection in serum samples with < 2 mu l sample volume in 5 min. The integrated prototype biosensor unit demonstrates the potential of the method as a rapid, inexpensive, high sensitivity CVD biomarker assay. The highly simplified protocols and enhanced sensor performance make our biosensor an ideal choice for point of care diagnostics and personal healthcare systems.

AB A plethora of publications has continuously reported electrochemical biosensors for detection of pesticides. However, those devices rarely accomplish commercial application due to technical issues associated with the lack of stability and high cost of the biological recognition element (enzyme). Alternatively, the biomimetic catalysts have arisen as a candidate for application in electrochemical biosensors to overcome the enzymatic drawbacks, combining low cost scalable materials with superior stability. Herein, for the first time, we propose a biomimetic biosensor for organophosphorus pesticide detection employing a functionalized polyacrylamide, polyhydroxamicalkanoate (PHA), which mimics the performance of the acetylcholinesterase (AChE) enzyme. The PHA bears functional groups inserted along its backbone chain working as active sites. Thereby, PHA was immobilized on screen printed electrodes (SPE) through a blend formation with poly(ethylene glycol) methyl ether (mPEG) to prevent its leaching out from the surface. Under optimum conditions, the biomimetic sensor was employed for the amperometric detection of paraoxon-ethyl,, fenitrothion and chlorpyrifos ranging from 1.0 and 10.0 mu mol L-1 with a limit of detection of 0.36 mu mol L-1, 0.61 mu mol L-1, and 0.83 mu mol L-1, respectively. Typical AChE-based interfering species did not affect the PHA performance, which endorsed its superior behavior. The proposed biomimetic biosensor, denoted as SPE/PHA/mPEG, represents a significant advance in the field, offering a new path for low cost devices by means of an artificial enzyme, simple configuration and superior stability. Moreover, the biosensor performance can be further improved by modifying the electrode surface to enhance electronic transfer rate.

AB One of the main targets in current clinical oncology is the development of a cheap device capable of monitoring in real-time the concentration of a drug in the blood of a patient. This would allow fine-tuning the dosage according to the patient's metabolism, a key condition to reduce side effects. By using surface plasmon resonance and fluorescence spectroscopy we here show that short peptides designed in silica by a recently developed algorithm are capable of binding the anticancer drug irinotecan (CPT-11) with micromolar affinity. Importantly, the recognition takes place in the denaturating solution used in standard therapeutic drug monitoring to detach the drug from the proteins that are present in human plasma, and some of the peptides are capable of distinguishing CPT-11 from its metabolite SN-38. These results suggest that the in silico design of small artificial peptides is now a viable route for designing sensing units, opening a wide range of applications in diagnostic and clinical areas.

AB Dual-functional cupric oxide nanorods (CuONRs) as peroxidase mimics are proposed for the development of a flow-through, label-free chemiluminescent (CL) immunosensor. Forming the basis of this cost-efficient, label free immunoassay, CuONRs, synthesized using a simple hydrothermal method, were deposited onto epoxy activated standard glass slides, followed by immobilization of biotinylated capture antibodies through a streptavidin bridge. The CuONRs possess excellent catalytic activity, along with high stability as a solid support. Antigens could then be introduced to the sensing system, forming large immunocomplexes that prevent CL substrate access to the surface, thereby reducing the CL signal in a concentration dependent fashion. Using carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) as a model analyte, the proposed label-free immunosensor was able to rapidly determine CEA with a wide linear range of 0.1-60 ng mL(-1) and a low detection limit of 0.05 ng mL(-1). This nanozyme-based immunosensor is simple, sensitive, cost-efficient, and has the potential to be a very promising platform for fast and efficient biosensing applications.

AB Nanowires (NWs)-based field-effect transistors (FETs) have attracted considerable interest to develop innovative biosensors using NWs of different materials (i.e. semiconductors, polymers, etc.). NWs-based FETs provide significant advantages over the other bulk or non-NWs nanomaterials-based FETs. As the building blocks for FET-based biosensors, one-dimensional NWs offer excellent surface-to-volume ratio and are more suitable and sensitive for sensing applications. During the past decade, FET-based biosensors are smartly designed and used due to their great specificity, sensitivity, and high selectivity. Additionally, they have the advantage of low weight, low cost of mass production, small size and compatible with commercial planar processes for large-scale circuitry. In this respect, we summarize the recent advances of NWs-based FET biosensors for different biomolecule detection i.e. glucose, cholesterol, uric acid, urea, hormone, proteins, nucleotide, biomarkers, etc. A comparative sensing performance, present challenges, and future prospects of NWs-based FET biosensors are discussed in detail.

AB The molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP) films were electropolymerized on the surface of Au electrodes with luminol and pyrrole (PY) as the two monomers and ampicillin (AM) as the template molecule. The electrochemiluminescence (ECL) intensity peak of polyluminol (PL) of the AM-free MIP films at 0.7 V vs Ag/AgCl could be greatly enhanced by AM rebinding. In addition, the ECL signals of the MIP films could also be enhanced by the addition of glucose oxidase (GOD)/glucose and/or ferrocenedicarboxylic acid (Fc(COOH)(2)) in the testing solution. Moreover, Fc(COOH)(2) exhibited cyclic voltammetric (CV) response at the AM-free MIP film electrodes. Based on these results, a binary 3-input/6-output biomolecular logic gate system was established with AM, GOD and Fc(COOH)(2) as inputs and the ECL responses at different levels and CV signal as outputs. Some functional non-Boolean logic devices such as an encoder, a decoder and a demultiplexer were also constructed on the same platform. Particularly, on the basis of the same system, a ternary AND logic gate was established. The present work combined MIP film electrodes, the solid-state ECL, and the enzymatic reaction together, and various types of biomolecular logic circuits and devices were developed, which opened a novel avenue to construct more complicated bio-logic gate systems.

AB In this paper, a novel molecularly imprinted electrochemical sensor (MIECS) based on a glassy carbon electrode (GCE) modified with graphene quantum dots (GQDs) coated on hollow nickel nanospheres (hNiNS) for the rapid determination of bisphenol S (BPS) was proposed for the first time. HNiNS and GQDs as electrode modifications were used to enlarge the active area and electron-transport ability for amplifying the sensor signal, while molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP) film was electropolymerized by using pyrrole as monomer and BPS as template to detect BPS via cyclic voltammetry (CV). Scanning electron microscope (SEM), energy dispersive spectrometry (EDS), CV and differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) were employed to characterize the fabricated sensor. Experimental conditions, such as molar ratio of monomer to template, electropolymerization cycles, pH, incubation time and elution time were optimized. The DPV response of the MIECS to BPS was obtained in the linear range from 0.1 to 50 mu M with a low limit of detection (LOD) of 0.03 mu M (S/N = 3) under the optimized conditions. The MIECS exhibited excellent response towards BPS with high sensitivity, selectivity, good reproducibility, and stability. In addition, the proposed MIECS was also successfully applied for the determination of BPS in the plastic samples with simple sample pretreatment.

AB Influenza viruses have threatened animals and public health systems continuously. Moreover, there are many subtypes of influenza viruses, which have brought great difficulties to the classification of influenza viruses during any influenza outbreak. So it is crucial to develop a rapid and accurate method for detecting and subtyping influenza viruses. In this work, we reported a rapid method for simultaneously detecting and subtyping multiple influenza viruses (H1N1, H3N2 and H9N2) based on nucleic acid hybridization on a microfluidic chip integrated with controllable micro-magnetic field. H1N1, H3N2 and H9N2 could be simultaneously detected in 80 min with detection limits about 0.21 nM, 0.16 nM, 0.12 nM in order. Moreover, the sample and reagent consumption was as low as only 3 mu L. The results indicated that this approach possessed fast analysis and high specificity. Therefore, it is expected to be used to simultaneously subtype and detect multiple targets, and may provide a powerful technique platform for the rapid detection and subtyping analysis of influenza viruses.

AB In order to achieve high predictive value of cell chemosensitivity test for clinical efficacy, cancer cells were suggested to be encapsulated and cultured in hydrogel to mimic the natural microenvironment of tumors. However, handling 3D cells/hydrogel culture construct is tedious and cellular response is difficult to be quantitatively analyzed. In the current study, a novel platform for conducting 3D cell culture and analyzing cell viability has been developed towards a high throughput drug screening. Cells encapsulated in the hydrogel were cultured in the microwells of a paper substrate. The substrate was then immersed in the culture medium containing drug for 2 days. At 24 and 48 h during the culture course, the paper substrate was placed on the measurement electrodes for conducting the impedance measurement in order to quantify the cell viability in the hydrogel. Cell viability of two human hepatoma cell lines (Huh7 and Hep-G2) was quantitatively investigated under the treatment of two drugs (doxorubicin and etoposide). The results represented by IC50 values revealed that Huh7 cells had a higher drug resistance than Hep-G2 cells and doxorubicin had a higher efficacy than etoposide for treating hepatocellular carcinoma. The current work has demonstrated a high throughput, convenient, and quantitative platform for the investigation of chemosensitivity of cells cultured in the 3D environment.

AB Early cancer detection and treatment is an emerging and fascinating field of plasmonic nanobiosensor research. It paves to enrich a life without affecting living cells leading to a possible survival of the patient. This review describes a past and future prospect of an integrated research field on nanostructured metamaterials, microwave transmission, surface plasmonic resonance, nanoantennas, and their manifested versatile properties with nano-biosensors towards early cancer detection to preserve human health. Interestingly, (i) microwave transmission shows more advantages than other electromagnetic radiation in reacting with biological tissues, (ii) nanostructured metamaterial (Au) with special properties like size and shape can stimulate plasmonic effects, (iii) plasmonic based nanobiosensors are to explore the efficacy for early cancer tumour detection or single molecular detection and (iv) nanoantenna wireless communication by using microwave inverse scattering nanomesh (MISN) technique instead of conventional techniques can be adopted to characterize the microwave scattered signals from the biomarkers. It reveals that the nanostructured material with plasmonic nanobiosensor paves a fascinating platform towards early detection of cancer tumour and is anticipated to be exploited as a magnificent field in the future.

AB A sensitive electrochemiluminescence (ECL) aptasensor for aflatoxin M1 (AFM1) detection by a closed bipolar electrode (BPE) array has been introduced. The thiolated AFM1 aptamer was immobilized on gold nanoparticle-coated magnetic Fe3O4 nanoparticles (Apt-GMNPs). Luminol-functionalized silver nanoparticle-decorated graphene oxide (GO-L-AgNPs) participates in pi-pi interactions with the unpaired bases of the immobilized aptamer (Apt-GMNPs-GO-L-AgNPs). After the Apt-GMNPs-GO-L-AgNPs were introduced to a gold anodic BPE array, the individual electrodes were subjected to different concentrations of AFM1. Upon the interaction of AFM1 with the aptamers, the GO-L-AgNPs detach from the aptamer; the resulting ECL of luminol and H2O2 at the anodic poles is monitored using a photomultiplier tube (PMT) or smartphone, and the images are analyzed using ImageJ software. This process triggers thionine reduction at the cathodic poles. Under the optimal conditions obtained by a face-centered central composite design (FCCD), the PMT-based detection of the BPE-ECL aptasensor exhibit a linear response over a wide dynamic range from 5 to 150 ng mL(-1), with a detection limit of 0.01 ng mL(-1). Additionally, smartphone-based detection shows a linear relationship between the ECL image gray value and the logarithmic concentration of the AFM1 target over a range of 10-200 ng mL(-1), with a detection limit of 0.05 ng mL(-1). Furthermore, the BPE-ECL aptasensor was successfully used to detect AFM1 in milk complex media without any serious interferences with reliable reproducibility (average relative standard deviation (RSD = 2.3%)). This smartphone-based detection opens a new horizon for bioanalysis that does not require a trained technician to operate and is a promising technology for point-of-care testing.

AB Detection of pathogens present in food and water is essential to help ensure food safety. Among the popular methods for pathogen detection are those based on culture and colony-counting and polymerase chain reaction (PCR). However, the time-consuming nature and/or the need for sophisticated instrumentation of those methods limit their on-site applications. We have developed a rapid and highly sensitive immunosensing method for visible detection of bacteria in real matrices based on the aggregation of AuNPs without requiring any readout device. We use biotinylated anti-bacteria antibodies as bifunctional linkers (BLs) to mediate the aggregation of streptavidin-functionalized gold nanoparticles (st-AuNPs) to produce visually recognizable color change, due to surface plasmon resonance (SPR), which occurs in about 30 min of total assay time when the sample is mildly agitated or within three hours in quiescent conditions. The aggregation of st-AuNPs, which produces the indication signal, is achieved very differently than in visual detection methods reported previously and hence affords ultrahigh sensitivity. While BLs can both bind to the target and crosslink st-AuNPs, their latter function is essentially disabled when they bind to the target bacteria. By varying the amount of st-AuNPs used, we can tailor the assay effectiveness improving limit of detection (LOD) down to 10 CFU mL(-1) of E. coli and Salmonella. Test results obtained with tap water, lake water and milk samples show that assay performance is unaffected by matrix effects. Further, in a mixture of live and autoclaved E. coll. cells our assay could detect only live cells. Therefore, our BL-based immunosensor is suitable for highly sensitive, rapid, and on-site detection of bacteria in real matrices.

AB Highly sensitive detection of chemokines in various biological matrices and its interaction with a natural receptor molecule has tremendous importance in cell signaling, medical diagnostics, and therapeutics. In this direction, we have designed the first bifunctional nanobiosensor for chemokine screening and detection in a single experimental setting. The sensor probe was fabricated by immobilizing CXCR2 on the gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) deposited 2,2':5',2 ''-terthiophene-3' (p-benzoic acid) (TBA) nanocomposite film. The interaction between CXCR2 and chemokines was studied using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and voltammetry. CXCL5 among three ligands showed the strongest affinity to CXCR2, which was further utilized to develop an amperometric CXCL5 biosensor. Analytical parameters, such as CXCR2 receptor concentration, temperature, pH, and incubation time were optimized to obtain the high sensitivity. A dynamic range for CXCL5 detection was obtained between 0.1 and 10 ng/mL with the detection limit of 0.078 +/- 0.004 ng/mL (RSD < 4.7%). The proposed biosensor was successfully applied to detect CXCL5 in clinically relevant concentrations in human serum and colorectal cancer cells samples with high sensitivity and selectivity. Interference effect and the stability of the developed biosensor were also evaluated. Method verification was performed by comparing the results using commercially available ELISA kit for CXCL5 detection.

AB Rapid and sensitive diagnosing hematological infections based on the separation and detection of pathogenic bacteria in the patient's blood is a significant challenge. To address this, we herein present a new barcodes technology that can simultaneously capture and detect multiple types of pathogenic bacteria from a complex sample. The barcodes are poly (ethylene glycol) (PEG) hydrogel inverse opal particles with characteristic reflection peak codes that remain stable during bacteria capture on their surfaces. As the spherical surface of the particles has ordered porous nanostructure, the barcodes can provide not only more surface area for probe immobilization and reaction, but also a nanopatterned platform for highly efficient bioreactions. In addition, the PEG hydrogel scaffold could decrease the non-specificity adsorption by its anti-adhesive effect, and the decorated aptamer probes in the scaffolds could increase the sensitivity, reliability, and specificity of the bacteria capture and detection. Moreover, the tagged magnetic nanoparticles in the PEG scaffold could impart the barcodes with controllable movement under magnetic fields, which can be used to significantly increase the reaction speed and simplify the processing of the bioassays. Based on the describe barcodes, it was demonstrated that the bacteria could be captured and identified even at low bacterial concentrations (100 CPU ml(-1)) within 2.5 h, which is effectively shortened in comparison with the "gold standard" in clinic. These features make the barcodes ideal for capturing and detecting multiple bacteria from clinical samples for hematological infection diagnostics.

AB Cancer is one of leading causes of death in the world and occurs in more than two hundred types according to the National Cancer Institute. Its early diagnosis has been remained a prime focus amongst scientists and clinicians since long, not only to understand the complications but also to mitigate its chance of further proliferation. Nowadays, tremendous advances in nanotechnology-empowered diagnostics are serving a substantial input to identify biomarkers associated with various cancers. These biomarkers are found in different forms including overexpressed proteins/surface antigens, metabolites, miRNA, and the entire cell as well. Several approaches have been adopted to detect such cancer biomarkers, where electrochemical sensors have widely been appreciated due to its high sensitivity, selectivity, robustness, and miniaturized point-of-care cancer diagnostics. Due to its immense importance, the present review has been formulated describing classical concepts of cancer biomarker discovery followed by the recent status of electrochemical biosensors for cancer diagnoses. Particularly, we have summarized the state-of-the-art technologies based on potentiometric, impedimetric, amperometric, voltammetric biosensors for the detection of different biomarkers viz. protein, miRNA, whole cell and biomarkers generated by metabolic shift in response to carcinoma population. Apart from these, we have also highlighted different deliverable microfluidics-based approaches and recent prototypes for cancer detection. To put various perceptive insights on the recent advancements in cancer diagnostics, an extended table is incorporated, which includes sensor fabrication strategies, type of biomarkers, detection strategies, and analytical performance of the cancer biosensor since last five years (2013-2017).

AB The lipidic liquid-crystalline cubic phase (LCP) is a membrane-mimetic material useful for the stabilization and structural analysis of membrane proteins. Here, we focused on the incorporation of the membrane ATP-hydrolysing sodium/potassium transporter Na+/K+-ATPase (NKA) into a monoolein-derived LCP. Small-angle Xray scattering was employed for the determination of the LCP structure, which was of Pn3m symmetry for all the formulations studied. The fully characterized NKA-LCP material was immobilized onto a glassy carbon electrode, forming a highly stable enzyme electrode and a novel sensing platform. A typical NKA voltammetric signature was monitored via the anodic reaction of tyrosine and tryptophan residues. The in situ enzyme activity evaluation was based on the ability of NKA to transform ATP to ADP and free phosphate, the latter reacting with ammonium molybdate to form the ammonium phosphomolybdate complex under acidic conditions. The square-wave voltammetric detection of phosphomolybdate was performed and complemented with spectrophotometric measurement at 710 nm. The anodic voltammetric response, corresponding to the catalytic ATP-hydrolysing function of NKA incorporated into the LCP, was monitored at around + 0.2 V vs. Ag/AgC1 in the presence or absence of ouabain, a specific NKA inhibitor. NKA incorporated into the LCP retained its ATP-hydrolysing activity for 7 days, while the solubilized protein became practically inactive. The novelty of this work is the first incorporation of NKA into a lipidic cubic phase with consequent enzyme functionality and stability evaluation using voltammetric detection. The application of LCPs could also be important in the further development of new membrane protein electrochemical sensors and enzyme electrodes.

AB A new near-infrared electrochemiluminescence resonance energy transfer (NECL-RET) strategy for enzyme-free amplified DNA detection was designed. In this strategy, the quaternary Cu-Zn-In-S nanocrystals (NCs) were applied as the ECL donor and gold nanostars (AuNSs) were used as the acceptor. The flowerlike MoS2/GO/o-MWNTs nanostructure was synthesized and used as an outstanding substrate to immobilize the NCs. ECL measurements demonstrated that the NCs assembled on the MoS2/GO/o-MWNTs film resulted in ECL intensity amplified by similar to 2.5-fold compared to that of the NCs assembled directly on the GCE. The Sem used here was not only as a coupling reagent to attach the NCs on the MoS2/GO/o-MWNTs but also as a novel co-reaction accelerator to enhance the ECL intensity. In addition, we designed two hairpin DNA probes of H1 and H2, and based on the target-catalyzed hairpin assembly, tDNA could trigger the hybridization of the H1 and H2-AuNSs to be further released to initiate the next hybridization process to capture a larger number of H2-AuNSs on the electrode surface, which resulted in the quenching of the NCs ECL emission. Therefore, a dramatic increase in the ECL quenching efficiency proportional to the tDNA concentration was achieved. The linear range for tDNA detection was from 10 aM to 10 pM with a detection limit down to 10 aM. This design introduces the new concept of triple signal amplification into ECL determination, and it shows promise to be extended to provide a highly sensitive platform for various target DNA.

AB The rapidly growing demand for in situ real-time monitoring of chemical information in vitro and in vivo has attracted tremendous research efforts into the design and construction of high-performance biosensor devices. Herein, we develop a new type of flexible nanohybrid microelectrode based on carbon fiber wrapped by gold nanoparticles decorated nitrogen-doped carbon nanotube arrays, and explore its practical application in in situ electrochemical detection of cancer biomarker H2O2 secreted from live cancer cells. Our results demonstrate that carbon fiber material with microscale size and fascinating mechanical properties can be used as a robust and flexible microelectrode substrate in the electrochemical biosensor system. And the highly ordered nitrogen doped carbon nanotube arrays that grown on carbon fiber possess high surface area-to-volume ratio and abundant active sites, which facilitate the loading of high-density and uniformly dispersed gold nanoparticles on it. Benefited from the unique microstructure and excellent electrocatalytic properties of different components in the nanohybrid fiber microelectrode, an effective electrochemical sensing platform based on it has been built up for the sensitive and selective detection of H2O2, the detection limit is calculated to be 50 nM when the signal-to-noise ratio is 3:1, and the linear dynamic range is up to 4.3 mM, with a high sensitivity of 142 mu A cm(-2) mM(-1). These good sensing performances, coupled with its intrinsic mechanical flexibility and biocompatibility, allow for its use in in situ real-time tracking H2O2 secreted from breast cancer cell lines MCF-7 and MBA-MD-231, and evaluating the sensitivity of different cancer cells to chemotherapy or radiotherapy treatments, which hold great promise for clinic application in cancer diagnose and management.

AB A single-step, homogeneous and sensitive LRET assay is presented for the detection of miRNAs. The amplification-free assay provides a unique combination of high specificity with dual-recognition approach of different hybridization and ligation steps and preventing background auto-fluorescence in biological samples using up conversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) as signal-producing nanoprobes. The assay probe is composed of signal producing unit (a pair of homogeneous upconversion luminescence resonance energy transfer (UC-LRET)-based oligonucleotides) and recognition unit (two adaptor oligonucleotides). In the presence of target miRNAs, the probe and target miRNAs leads to the formation of stable double-strands and semi-stable adaptor-miRNAs complexes with an adaptor nick. Ligation of the nick using ligase cause the formation of stable double-strands, resulting in UCNPs-to-dye UC-LRET for detection of the miRNAs with near-infrared radiation (980 nm). Sensitive detection of miRNA-21 at concentrations of 200 pM to 1.4 nM and detection limits of 0.095 nM with good precision of 3.9% (RSD) for seven repeated measurements of 500 pM miRNAs demonstrate the feasibility of both high throughput and point-of-care clinical diagnostics. The homogeneous UC-LRET assay without any washing can be extended to the application in other important types of nucleic acid analysis.

AB The rapid detection of antibiotic residual in everyday life is very important for food safety. In order to realize the on-site and visual detection of antibiotic, a POCT method was established by using digital image colorimetry based on smartphone. Streptomycin was taken as the analyte model of antibiotics, streptomycin aptamer preferentially recognized analyte, and the excess aptamer hybridized with the complementary DNA to form the dsDNA. SYBR Green I combined with the dsDNA and then emitted obvious green fluorescence, thus the fluorescence intensity decreased with the increasing of streptomycin concentration. Then a smartphone-based device was constructed as the fluorescence readout. The smartphone camera acquired the images of the fluorescence derived from the samples, and the Touch Color APP installed in smartphone read out the RGB values of the images. There was a linear relationship between the G values and the streptomycin concentrations in the range of 0.1-100 mu M. The detection limit was 94 nM, which was lower than the maximum residue limit defined by World Health Organization. The POCT method was applied for determining streptomycin in chicken and milk samples with recoveries in 94.1-110%. This method had the advantages of good selectivity, simple operation and on-site visualization.

AB In this work, hernia was firstly used as electrochemically regenerable co-reaction accelerator for signal amplification to develop an ultrasensitive aptasensor for Aflatoxin M1 (AFM1) detection. Initially, the perylenetetracarboxylic acid (PTCA) was directly employed as luminophore to construct the ECL sensing nano-platform by combining Au nanoparticles (Au NPs) for immobilizing thiol-terminated hairpin probe (H1). Then with the help of hairpin H2, H3, the AFM1-catalyzed hairpin assembly (CHA) was executed to produce the H1-H3 duplex, which could further initiate the hybridization chain reaction (HCR) to generate dendritic DNA polymers consisting of G-rich sequence for capturing large quantities of hernia on the electrode surface. Herein, hemin as electrochemically regenerable co-reaction accelerator could interact with the co-reactant (S2O82-) to obviously improve the luminous efficiency of the PTCA. Therefore, a strong and stable ECL signal was achieved by the employment of hemin as electrochemically regenerable co-reaction accelerator. The proposed aptasensor determined AFM1 down to 0.09 pg mL(-1) within a linear range of 0.4 pg mL(-1) to 400 ng mL(-1). With excellent sensitivity and stability, the strategy provided an efficient and simple method for the trace detection of biomolecules in clinical analysis.

AB A new kind of designed water-compatible molecularly imprinted conductive nanoparticles was prepared by combining macromolecular self-assembly with molecularly imprinting technique. An amphiphilic random copolymer poly(DMA-co-EHA-co-HEA-co-St) containing imino groups and photocrosslinking units was synthesized through free radical copolymerization, which could self-assemble with template molecules (glucose) in aqueous solution to establish nanoparticles embedded with glucose. Meanwhile, AuCl4-, as precursor, was added to generate Au NPs in situ because of reducibility of protonated imino groups, leading to the formation of molecularly imprinted polymeric nanoparticles decorated with Au NPs (Au@MIPNs). By simply adjusting the pH value of the assembly solution, Au@MIPNs with different loading amount of Au NPs could be obtained. Electrodeposition was employed to fabricate a robust integration of MIP film with a transducer, then the film was photo-crosslinked by UV irradiation. After extraction of the template molecules, an MIP sensor modified with Au NPs (Au@MIP sensor) was successfully constructed. The presence of Au NPs greatly improved the conductivity of Au@MIP film and allowed direct electrical connection between the recognition cavities and the transducer, which enhanced the sensitivity of the sensor for templates detection. Effect of Au NPs amount on the performance of the Au@MIP sensor was also evaluated. The obtained Au@MIP sensor demonstrated acceptable selectivity and wider linear ranges (two linear ranges from 10(-10) to 10(-8) mol L-1 and 10(-8) to 10 mol L-1 with a detection limit of 3 x10(-12) mol L-1) for glucose detection than MIP sensor without decoration of Au NPs.

AB We built a flexible, stretchable microbial fuel cell (MFC) by laminating two functional components: a bioanode textile with a conductive and hydrophilic polymer coating and a solid-state cathode textile loaded with silver oxide. The textile MFC used Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 as a biocatalyst to generate the maximum power and current density of 1.0 mu W/cm(2) and 6.3 mu A/cm(2), respectively, which are comparable with or even higher than other flexible MFCs such as paper-based devices (similar to a few mu W/cm(2)). Additionally, the textile MFC generated consistent power even with repeated 70 cycles of 50% stretching. A simple batch fabrication method simultaneously produced 20 individual 2 cm x 2 cm devices by using brushing, spraying, ironing, and computerized sewing, a process that will revolutionize the mass production of textile MFCs. This achievement is scientifically meaningful because developing textile MFCs requires integration of both electronic and fluidic components into the textile three-dimensionally. This flexible and stretchable energy harvesting device is expected to be easily integrated with the next generation stretchable electronics for realizing low-power, stand-alone, self-sustainable systems.

AB An ultrasensitive sandwich-type electrochemical immunosensor was proposed for quantitative detection of hepatitis B surface antigen, which is a representative biomarker of the Hepatitis B virus. First, the porous graphene oxide/Au composites with good conductive ability were employed to accelerate the electron transfer on the electrode interface. Furthermore, the amino functionalized molybdenum disulfide @ cuprous oxide hybrid with coral morphology was prepared to combine platinum nanoparticles for achieving signal amplification strategy. The resulting nanocomposites (molybdenum disulfide @ cuprous oxide - platinum) demonstrated uniform coral morphology, which effectively improved the specific surface area available for loading the secondary antibody and the number of catalytically active sites, even also increased the electrical conductivity. Based on these advantages, this composite system yielded a superior electrocatalytic current response toward the reduction of hydrogen peroxide. In addition, porous graphene oxide/Au composites were used to modify the glassy carbon electrode, thereby presenting a large surface area and becoming biocompatible, for improving the loading capacity of the primary antibody. Under optimal conditions, we obtained a linear relationship between current signal and hepatitis B surface antigen concentration in the broad range from 0.5 pg/mL to 200 ng/mL, with a detection limit of 0.15 pg/mL (signal-to-noise ratio of 3). These values are promising towards clinical applications.

AB Dengue is a RNA viral illness of the genus Flavivirus which can cause, depending on the pervasiveness of the infection, hemorrhagic dengue fever or dengue shock syndrome. Herein we present an electrochemical label free approach enabling the rapid sensitive quantification of NS1 and IgG (supporting an ability to distinguish primary and secondary infections). Using a bifunctional SAM containing PEG moieties and a tethered redox thiol, both markers are detectable across clinically relevant levels by label free impedance derived redox capacitance. A subsequent frequency specific immittance function approach enables assaying (within seconds) with no impairment of analytical quality (linearity, sensitivity and variance).

AB A novel label-free ratiometric fluorescent probe is developed for the detection of H2O2 based on GelRed/[G(3)T](5)/Tb3+ hybrid, in which GelRed (a nucleic acid dye) intercalated into the designed single-stranded DNA [G(3)T](5) (Le. GelRed/[G(3)T](5)) acts as a stable build-in reference with red emission and Tb3+ sensitized by [G(3)T](5) (i.e. [G(3)T](5)/Tb3+) as a sensitive response signal with green fluorescence. With the successive addition of Hg2+ and cysteine (Cys) to GelRed/[G(3)T](5)/Tb3+, the fluorescence of [G(3)T](5)/Tb3+ can be effectively quenched and recovered respectively, while the fluorescence of GelRed/[G(3)T](5) remains unchangeable. Combined with these properties, we have demonstrated its application for label-free ratiometric fluorescence detection of H2O2 with self-calibration. The sensing mechanism is based on the specific reaction between H2O2 and Cys, the resulting disulfide reverses the Cys-mediated fluorescence changes of [G(3)T](5)/Tb3+. This method is further applied to the monitoring of oxidase-related reactions. As the glucose oxidase (GOx)-biocatalyzed oxidation of glucose and the acetylcholine esterase/choline oxidase (AChE/ChOx) cascade yield H2O2, such two biocatalytic processes are successfully examined utilized our proposed method, indicating its potential broad applications in biomedical analysis. In addition, we have also demonstrated its feasibility for oxidase-based visual biosensing, in which only a handheld UV lamp is used. Importantly, coupled with our proposed visual biosensing, a realtime quantitative scanometric assays has been also demonstrated by using a smartphone with easy-to-access color-scanning APP as the detection platform. Compared to traditional methods, the proposed design is cost-effective, simple to prepare and easy-to-use without fluorescence labeling or chemical modification.

AB Miniaturizing potentiostats, keeping their cost low and yet preserving full measurement characteristics (e.g. bandwidth, determination of capacitive/inductive contribution to sensor's impedance and parallel screening) is still an unresolved challenge in bioelectronics. In this work, the combination of simple analogue circuitry together with powerful microcontrollers and a digital filter implementation is presented as an alternative to complex and incomplete architectures reported in the literature. A low-cost acquisition electronic system fully integrated with a biosensors platform containing eight gold working microelectrodes and integrated reference and counter electrodes was developed and validated. The manufacturing cost of the prototype was kept below 300 USD. The performance of the proposed device was benchmarked against a commercial impedance analyzer through the electrochemical analysis of a highly sensitive biosensor for the detection of tumor necrosis factor a (TNF-alpha) within the randomly chosen range of 266 pg/mL to 666 ng/mL in physiological medium (PBS). A strong correlation between the outputs of both devices was found in a critical range of frequencies (1-10 Hz), and several TNF-alpha cytokine concentrations were properly discriminated. These results are very promising for the development of low-cost, portable and miniaturized electrochemical systems for point-of-care and environmental diagnosis.

AB A fully automated microfluidic-based electrochemical biosensor was designed and manufactured for pathogen detection. The quantification of Escherichia coil was investigated with standard and nanomaterial amplified immunoassays in the concentration ranges of 0.99 x 10(4) -3.98 x 10(9) cfu mL(-1) and 10-3.97 x 10(7) cfu mL(-1) which resulted in detection limits of 1.99 x 10(4) cfu mL(-1) and 50 cfu mL(-1), respectively. The developed methodology was then applied for E. coil quantification in water samples using nanomaterial modified assay. Same detection limit for E. coil was achieved for real sample analysis with a little decrease on the sensor signal. Cross-reactivity studies were conducted by testing Shigella, Salmonella spp., Salmonella typhimurium and Staphylococcus aureus on E. coli specific antibody surface that confirmed the high specificity of the developed immunoassays. The sensor surface could be regenerated multiple times which significantly reduces the cost of the system. Our custom-designed biosensor is capable of detecting bacteria with high sensitivity and specificity, and can serve as a promising tool for pathogen detection.

AB The development of reliable and ultrasensitive detection marker for mercury ions (Hg2+) in drinking water is of great interest for toxicology assessment, environmental protection and human health. Although many Hg2+ detection methods have been developed, only few offer sensitivities below 1 pM. Herein, we describe a simple histidine (H) conjugated perylene diimide (PDI) bolaamphiphile (HPH) as a dual-responsive optical marker to develop highly selective and sensitive probe as visible (sol-to-gel transformation), fluorescence and SERS-based Hg(2+)sensor platform in the water. Remarkably, HPH as a SERS marker supported on Au deposited mono dispersed nanospheres monolayers (Au-MNM) of polystyrene offers an unprecedented selectivity and the best ever reported detection limit (LOD) of 60 attomolar (aM, 0.01 parts-per-quadrillion (ppq)) for Hg2+ in water. This is ten orders of magnitude lower than the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) tolerance limit of Hg2+ in drinking water (10 nM, 2 ppb). This simple and effective design principle of host-guest interactions driven fluorescence and SEAS-based detection may inspire the future molecular engineering strategies for the development of ultrasensitive toxic analyte sensor platforms.

AB Polydopamine (PDA) can be formed by monomeric self-polymerization in water. This convenient behavior was exploited to prepare a molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP) layer on the surface of multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) with sunset yellow (SY) as a template molecule. The prepared nanocomposites were characterized, and their electrochemical behavior towards SY was investigated. Under the optimized conditions, a glassy carbon electrode modified with the imprinted nanocomposite showed a highly selective and ultrasensitive electrochemical response to SY compared with the performance of control electrodes and previously reported electrochemical sensors for SY. The improved behavior of the developed sensor can be attributed to its superficial highly matched imprinted cavities on the excellent electrocatalytic matrix of MWCNTs and the electronic barrier of the non-imprinted PDA to outside molecules. The fabricated sensor expressed a linear relationship to SY concentrations from 2.2 nM to 4.64 M with a detection limit of 1.4 nM (S/N = 3). The sensor also exhibited excellent selectivity for SY over its structural analogs, good stability, and adequate reproducibility. The prepared sensor was successfully used to detect SY in real spiked samples. This methodology has potential application value and may be readily adapted to design other PDA-based MIP sensors.

AB A critical challenge in surface-based DNA assembly amplification is the reduced accessibility of DNA strands arranged on a heterogeneous surface compared to that in homogeneous solution. Here, a novel in situ surface confined DNA assembly amplification electrochemiluminescence (ECL) biosensor based on DNA nanostructural scaffold was presented. In this design, a stem-loop structural DNA segment (Hairpin 1) was constructed on the vertex of DNA nanostructural scaffold as recognition probe. In the present of target DNA, the hairpin structure changed to rod-like through complementary hybridization with target DNA, resulting in the formation of Hairpin 1:target DNA. When the obtained Hairpin 1:target DNA met Hairpin 2 labeled with glucose oxidase (GOD), the DNA cyclic amplification was activated, releasing target DNA into homogeneous solution for the next recycling. Thus, the ECL signal of Ru(bpy)(3)(2+)-TPrA system was quenched by H2O2, the product of GOD catalyzing glucose. As a result, this proposed method achieved a linear range response from 50 aM to 10 pM with lower detection limit of 20 aM.

AB Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) is a wide group of diseases, characterized by synovial inflammation and joint tissue damage. Due to the delay in the implementation of biomarkers into clinical practice and the association with severe sequels, there is an imperative need for new JIA diagnosis strategies. Electrochemical biosensors based on screen-printed electrodes and peptides are promising alternatives for molecular diagnosis. In this work, a novel biosensor for detecting juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) was developed based on the immobilization of the PRF + 1 mimetic peptide, as recognition biological element, on the surface of screen-printed carbon electrode. This biosensor was able to discriminate the JIA positive and negative serum samples from different individuals using differential pulse voltammetry, presenting limits of detection and quantification in diluted samples of 1:784 (v/v) and 1:235 (v/v), respectively. Evaluation by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy showed Rcr 3 times higher for JIA positive sample than for a pool of human serum samples from healthy individuals. Surface analysis of the biosensor by atomic force microscopy, after contact with JIA positive serum, presented great globular clusters irregularly distributed. The long-term stability of the biosensor was evaluated, remaining functional for over 40 days of storage (after storage at 8 degrees C). Therefore, a simple, miniaturized and selective biosensor was developed, being the first one based on mimetic peptide and screen-printed carbon electrode, aiming at the diagnosis of the juvenile idiopathic arthritis in real serum samples.

AB Combining double-layer capillary based high gradient immunomagnetic separation, invertase-nanocluster based signal amplification and glucose meter based signal detection, a novel biosensor was developed for sensitive and rapid detection of E. coil O157:H7 in this study. The streptavidin modified magnetic nanobeads (MNBs) were conjugated with the biotinylated polyclonal antibodies against E. coil O:H7 to form the immune MNBs, which were captured by the high gradient magnetic field in the double-layer capillary to specifically separate and efficiently concentrate the target bacteria. Calcium chloride was used with the monoclonal antibodies against E. coil O157:H7 and the invertase to form the immune invertase-nanoclusters (INCs), which were used to react with the target bacteria to form the MNB-bacteria-INC complexes in the capillary. The sucrose was then injected into the capillary and catalyzed by the invertase on the complexes into the glucose, which was detected using the glucose meter to obtain the concentration of the glucose for final determination of the E. coil O157:H7 cells in the sample. A linear relationship between the readout of the glucose meter and the concentration of the E. coil O157:H7 cells (from 10(2) to 10(7) CFU/mL) was found and the lower detection limit of this biosensor was 79 CFU/mL. This biosensor might be extended for the detection of other foodborne pathogens by changing the antibodies and has shown the potential for the detection of foodborne pathogens in a large volume of sample to further increase the sensitivity.

AB There is a critical need for better biosensors for the detection and diagnosis of malaria. We previously developed a DNA aptamer that recognises the Plasmodium falciparum lactate dehydrogenase (PfLDH) enzyme with high sensitivity and specificity. The aptamer was integrated into an Aptamer-Tethered Enzyme Capture (APTEC) assay as a laboratory-based diagnostic approach. However, a portable equipment-free point-of-care aptamer-mediated biosensor could have a significant impact on malaria diagnosis in endemic regions. Here, we present a new concept for a malaria biosensor whereby aptamers are coated onto magnetic microbeads for magnet-guided capture, wash and detection of the biomarker. A biosensor incorporating three separate microfluidic chambers was designed to enable such magnet-guided equipment-free colorimetric detection of PfLDH. A series of microfluidic biosensor prototypes were optimised to lower rates of inter-chamber diffusion, increase sensitivity, and provide a method for point-of-care sample testing. The biosensor showed high sensitivity and specificity when detecting PfLDH using both in vitro cultured parasite samples and using clinical samples, from malaria patients. The high performance of the biosensor provides a proof-of-principle for a portable biosensor that could be adaptable for a variety of aptamer-mediated diagnostic scenarios.

AB Hematin plays a crucial role in various physiological functions, and the determination of hematin in complex biological matrixes is a significant but difficult issue. Considering the unique photophysical/photochemical properties of carbon quantum dots (CQDs) prepared with p-aminobenzoic acid (PABA) and ethanol, a new strategy for the design of fluorescent probes for hematin has been achieved. The proposed sensor array is fabricated based on the inner filter effect (IFE) between hematin and CQDs with phenomenon of selective fluorescence quenching of CQDs which results from the strong absorption of the excitation and emission spectrum of CQDs by hematin. The fluorescence quenching of CQDs is closely related to the amount of hematin and there is a good linear relationship over the range of 0.5-10 mu M with a detection limit of 0.25 mu M. What's more, the fluorescence assay has been successfully applied for hematin sensing in healthy human red cells showing this sensing assay has a great potential prospect for detection of hematin in the complex matrixes.

AB We report on the design and fabrication of a hybrid sensor that integrates transmission-mode localized surface plasmonic resonance (LSPR) into a quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) for studying biochemical surface reactions. The coupling of LSPR nanostructures and a QCM allows optical spectra and QCM resonant frequency shifts to be recorded simultaneously and analyzed in real time for a given surface adsorption process. This integration simplifies the conventional combination of SPR and QCM and has the potential to be miniaturized for application in point-of-care (POC) diagnostics. The influence of antibody-antigen recognition effect on both the QCM and LSPR has been analyzed and discussed.

AB This work designed a three-component polymer for the preparation of polymer dots (Pdots). The polymer contained 9-(diphenylmethylene)-9H-fluorene (DPF), 9,9-dioctyl-9H-fluorene (DOF) and 1,1'-binaphthyl moieties, and was synthesized via Pd-catalyzed Suzuki reaction. It exhibited obvious yellow-colored aggregation-induced emission (AIE) for fluorescence enhancement at 543 nm via an intramolecular fluorescence resonance energy transfer from DOF moiety to DPF moiety. The Pdots prepared by nanoprecipitation could be conveniently cast on electrode surface and showed a stable anodic electrochemiluminescence (ECL) emission in the presence of triethylamine as a co-reactant. The ECL emission could be effectively quenched by rhodamine B via resonance energy transfer, which led to an "off-on" switch for the design of ECL sensing methodology. Using Pb2+ as a target model, an ECL aptasensor for the detection of trace Pb2+ was proposed, which showed a linear range of 100 pM to 1.0 mu M with a detection limit down to 38.0 pM This work demonstrated the first Pdots prepared with ME-active polymer for highly efficient ECL sensing.

AB Increasing numbers of legionellosis outbreaks within the last years have shown that Legionella are a growing challenge for public health. Molecular biological detection methods capable of rapidly identifying viable Legionella are important for the control of engineered water systems. The current gold standard based on culture methods takes up to 10 days to show positive results. For this reason, a flow-based chemiluminescence (CL) DNA microarray was developed that is able to quantify viable and non-viable Legionella spp. as well as Legionella pneumophila in one hour. An isothermal heterogeneous asymmetric recombinase polymerase amplification (haRPA) was carried out on flow-based CL DNA microarrays. Detection limits of 87 genomic units (GU) mu L-1 and 26 GU mu L-1 for Legionella spp. and Legionella pneumophila, respectively, were achieved. In this work, it was shown for the first time that the combination of a propidium monoazide (PMA) treatment with haRPA, the so-called viability haRPA, is able to identify viable Legionella on DNA microarrays. Different proportions of viable and non-viable Legionella, shown with the example of L. pneumophila, ranging in a total concentration between 10(1) to 10(5) GU mu L-1 were analyzed on the microarray analysis platform MCR 3. Recovery values for viable Legionella spp. were found between 81% and 133%. With the combination of these two methods, there is a chance to replace culture-based methods in the future for the monitoring of engineered water systems like condensation recooling plants.

AB The increasing needs of point-of-care diagnostics, quarantine of epidemic pathogens, and prevention of terrorism's bio-attacks have promised the future of portable real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) sensors. This work aims at developing a highly sensitive and low-cost light emitting diode (LED)-based epifluorescence sensor module for qPCR sensor development and relevant bioassay applications. Inspired by the light stop design and dark-field detection of microscopes, this paper first reports a compact confocal LED epifluorescence sensor using a light stop with an arc-shaped aperture for enhancing the flexibility of quick DNA and PCR detection. The sensor features the advantages of the dichroic mirror-free and confocal (shared-focus) characteristics, which benefits size reduction and minimal optics used. It also allows extension to integrate with in situ real-time PCR thermal cycling since the sample slide is placed apart from the epi-sensing module. The epifluorescence sensor can detect as low as sub-ng/mu L standard DNA and 10(1) copies of Salmonella typhimurium InvA gene sequences (cloned in E. coli and after 30-cycle PCR) with SYBR (R) Green I from non purified culture samples, having highly sensitive and specific signal responses comparable with that of a commercial qPCR instrument.

AB In this work, a novel molecularly imprinted electrochemical sensor based on the amino-functionalized silica nanoparticles was built for the sensitive and selective detection of 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D). The hierarchical porous dendrimer-like silica nanoparticles (HPSNs-NH2) were synthesized by an ethyl ether emulsion method. The selective molecularly imprinted polymers (MIP) was prepared on the HPSNs-NH2 modified electrode via electropolymerization by using 2,4-D as the template and o-phenylenediamine (OPD) as the monomer. The porous structure of HPSNs-NH2 reduced the diffusion limitations of the analytes, enhanced the accessibility and increased the surface area of the sensor, while the MIP layer offered the ability to recognize and quantify target 2,4-D by using ferro/ferricyanide as probes. Several significant experimental parameters on the analytical performance of the MIP/HPSNs-NH2 sensor were explored and optimized. Under the optimized condition, the sensor displayed an appreciable selectivity over structurally related compounds and good sensitivity toward 2,4-D. The linear range of 2,4-D detection was from 1.00 x 10(-10) to 2.50 x 10(-8) M and the detection limit was down to 1.17 x 10(-11) M according to the 3S(a)/b criteria. This method has been applied to detect 2,4-D in bean sprout samples with satisfying results.

AB Spotted fever is a rare acute and multisystemic febrile infectious disease with a mortality rate of 50% without adequate antibiotic treatment, and in diagnosed and treated cases, of approximately 2.5%. Currently, the applied test to diagnose this disease is the indirect immunofluorescence reaction, however two samples of paired sera are necessary to confirm the diagnosis, since using only one sample may allow for confusion with cross reactions. OmpA is an outer membrane protein present in the R. rickettsia, the etiological agent of spotted fever, able to activate dendritic and macrophage cells. It also presents immunogenicity properties, and is considered a target for the development of diagnostic tests for spotted fever. In this context, an amperometric immunosensor was developed for the identification of sera antibodies (human IgG) from patients with spotted fever aimed at improving sensitivity and minimize sample volume. The development of the immunosensor was conducted using a synthetic peptide, derivative from the H6PGA4 R. rickettsia protein, homologous to OmpA. Amperometric responses were generated at -0.6 to 0.6 V, at a scan rate of 0.025 V s(-1) for 20 cycles, a limit of detection of approximately 10 ng mL(-1) for the synthetic peptides and 0.01 mu g mL(-1)for the humam serum, a sensitivity of 2.59 mu A, adequate for the detection of spotted fever antibodies. The construction of this immunosensor, capable of identifying circulating antibodies in real time, can also be applied in the diagnosis of other infectious-parasitic diseases.

AB Schizophrenia treatment may see a paradigm shift due to development of new atypical antipsychotic drugs (APDs), with better tolerability due to more selective dopamine (DA) receptor blockade. Monitoring of these APD candidates in biological fluids is of great importance to reduce the development cost, to clarify the mechanism of action and ultimately to support the demonstration of efficacy of these molecules. Electrochemical approaches have attracted great attention for monitoring DA and APD levels but none of the methods developed so far aimed to screen APD candidates. Herein, by this work, we propose for the first time an electrochemical ligand-binding approach for antipsychotic drug screening where competitive binding of a novel APD and DA to a dopamine D3 receptor (D3R) was investigated by looking at electrochemical signals of DA and drug before and after D3R interaction. D3R peptide was incubated with DA and/or drug first and then changes in electrochemical oxidation signals of free DA and the drug was measured by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and differential pulse voltammetry (DPV). Circular Dichroism pectroscopy was used to investigate the secondary structure of the peptide upon binding with either drug and/or DA.

AB Colorimetric assays based on gold nanoparticles (GNPs) are of considerable interest for diagnostics because of their simplicity and low-cost. Nevertheless, a deep understanding of the interaction between the GNPs and the intended molecular target is critical for the development of reliable detection technologies. The present report describes the spontaneous interaction between HPV16 L1 virus-like particles (VLPs) and non-functionalized GNPs (nfGNPs) resulting in the inhibition of nfGNPs salt-induced aggregation and the stabilization of purified VLPs. Ionic-competition experiments suggested that the nature of nfGNPs-VLPs interaction is non-covalent. Adsorption of an RNA aptamer on nfGNPs surface showed an additive aggregation-inhibitory effect. The use of mutant VLPs confirmed that the interaction nfGNPs-VLPs is not mediated by the opposing superficial electrostatic charges, suggesting that non-electrostatic forces participate in the arrangement of nfGNPs on the VLPs surface. Competition experiments using increasing ethanol concentrations on nfGNPs-VLPs complexes suggested hydrophobic interactions as the main stabilizing force. Therefore, the nfGNPs-VLPs interaction described here should facilitate the development of adsorption assays based on nfGNPs for HPV detection and cervical cancer prevention.

AB Integrin-transmitted cellular forces are critical for platelet adhesion, activation, aggregation and contraction during hemostasis and thrombosis. Measuring and mapping single platelet forces are desired in both research and clinical applications. Conventional force-to-strain based cell traction force microscopies have low resolution which is not ideal for cellular force mapping in small platelets. To enable platelet force mapping with submicron resolution, we developed a force-activatable biosensor named integrative tension sensor (ITS) which directly converts molecular tensions to fluorescent signals, therefore enabling cellular force mapping directly by fluorescence imaging. With ITS, we mapped cellular forces in single platelets at 0.4 mu m resolution. We found that platelet force distribution has strong polarization which is sensitive to treatment with the anti-platelet drug tirofiban, suggesting that the ITS force map can report anti-platelet drug efficacy. The ITS also calibrated integrin molecular tensions in platelets and revealed two distinct tension levels: 12-54 piconewton (nominal values) tensions generated during platelet adhesion and tensions above 54 piconewton generated during platelet contraction. Overall, the ITS is a powerful biosensor for the study of platelet mechanobiology, and holds great potential in antithrombotic drug development and assessing platelet activity in health and disease.

AB Nucleoside triphosphates (NTPs) play important roles in living organisms. However, no fluorescent assays are currently available to simply and rapidly detect multiple NTPs with satisfactory selectivity, sensitivity and low cost. Here we demonstrate for the first time a target-triggered in-vitro transcription machinery for ultra-selective, sensitive and instant fluorescence detection of multiple NTPs. The machinery assembles RNA polymerase, DNA template and non-target NTPs to convert the target NTP into equivalent RNA signal sequences which are monitored by the fluorescence enhancement of molecular beacon. The machinery offers excellent selectivity for the target NTP against NDP, NMP and dNTP. Notably, to accelerate the kinetics of the machinery while maintain its high specificity, we investigated the sequence of DNA templates systematically and established a set of guidelines for the design of the optimum DNA templates, which allowed for instant detection of the target NTP at fmol level in less than 1 min. Furthermore, the machinery could be transformed into logic gates to study the coeffects of two NTPs in biosynthesis and real-time monitoring systems to reflect the distribution of NTP in nucleotide pools. These results provide very useful and low-cost tools for both biochemical tests and point-of care analysis.

AB A new approach for the facile fabrication of electrochemical biosensors using a biohybrid conducting polymer was demonstrated using glucose oxidase (GOx) and poly (3, 4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) as a model. The biohybrid conducting polymer was prepared based on a template-assisted chemical polymerisation leading to the formation of PEDOT microspheres (PEDOT-MSs), followed by in-situ deposition of platinum nanoparticles (PtNPs) and electrostatic immobilisation of glucose oxidase (GOx) to form water processable GOx-PtNPs-PEDOT-MSs. The morphology, chemical composition and electrochemical performance of the GOx-PtNPs-PEDOT-MS-based glucose biosensor were characterised using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometry (EDS), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, zeta potential and electrochemical measurements, respectively. The biosensor delivered a linear response for glucose over the range 0.1-10 mM (R-2 = 0.9855) with a sensitivity of 116.25 mu A mM(-1) cm(-2), and limit of detection of 1.55 mu M (3 x SD/sensitivity). The sensitivity of the developed PEDOT-MS based biosensor is significantly higher (2.7 times) than the best reported PEDOT-based glucose biosensor in the literature. The apparent Michaelis Menten constant (K-m(app)) of the GOx-PtNPs-PEDOT-MS-based biosensors was calculated as 7.3 mM. Moreover, the biosensor exhibited good storage stability, retaining 97% of its sensitivity after 12 days storage. This new bio-hybrid conducting polymer combines the advantages of micro-structured morphology, compatibility with large-scale manufacturing processes, and intrinsic biocatalytic activity and conductivity, thus demonstrating its potential as a convenient material for printed bioelectronics and sensors.

AB Label-free biosensing methods are very effective for studying cell signaling cascade activation induced by external stimuli. Assays generally involve a large number of cells and rely on the underlying assumption that cell response is homogeneous within a cell population. However, there is an increasing body of evidence showing that cell behavior may vary significantly even among genetically identical cells. In this paper, we demonstrate the use of metal-clad waveguide (MCWG)-based microscopy for label-free real-time monitoring of signaling activity and morphology changes in a small population of cells, with the ability to resolve individual cells. We demonstrate the potential of this approach by quantifying apoptosis-induced intracellular activity in individual cells following exposure to tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) and by visualizing and quantifying extracellular changes in endothelial cell layer integrity following the activation of the proteinase-activated receptor 1 (PART) by thrombin. Results show that averaged signals obtained from a cell population may incorrectly reflect the actual distribution of morphology and kinetics parameters across a cell population by a significant margin.

AB Microelectrode array (MEA) technology in combination with three-dimensional (3D) neuronal cell models derived from human embryonic stem cells (hESC) provide an excellent tool for neurotoxicity screening. Yet, there are significant challenges in terms of data processing and analysis, since neuronal signals have very small amplitudes and the 3D structure enhances the level of background noise. Thus, neuronal signal analysis requires the application of highly sophisticated algorithms. In this study, we present a new approach optimized for the detection of spikes recorded from 3D neurospheres (NS) with a very low signal-to-noise ratio. This was achieved by extending simple threshold-based spike detection utilizing a highly sensitive algorithm named SWTTEO. This analysis procedure was applied to data obtained from hESC-derived NS grown on MEA chips. Specifically, we examined changes in the activity pattern occurring within the first ten days of electrical activity. We further analyzed the response of NS to the GABA receptor antagonist bicuculline. With this new algorithm method we obtained more reliable results compared to the simple threshold-based spike detection.

AB Extracellular respiring bacteria (ERB) are a group of bacteria capable of transferring electrons to extracellular acceptors and have important application in environmental remediation. In this study, a decomposable quantum-dots (QDs)/DNA nanosphere probe was developed for rapid and ultrasensitive detection of ERB. The QDs/DNA nanosphere was self-assembled from QDs-streptavidin conjugate (QDs-SA) and Y-shaped DNA nanostructure that is constructed based on toehold-mediated strand displacement. It can release numerous fluorescent QDs-SA in immunomagnetic separation (IMS)-based immunoassay via simple biotin displacement, which remarkably amplifies the signal of antigen-antibody recognizing event. This QDs/DNA-nanosphere-based IMS-fluorescent immunoassay is ultrasensitive for model ERB Shewanella oneidensis, showing a wide detection range between 1.0 cfu/mL and 1.0 x 108 cfu/mL with a low detection limit of 1.37 cfu/mL. Moreover, the proposed IMS-fluorescent immunoassay exhibits high specificity, acceptable reproducibility and stability. Furthermore, the proposed method shows acceptable recovery (92.4-101.4%) for detection of S. oneidensis spiked in river water samples. The proposed IMS-fluorescent immunoassay advances an intelligent strategy for rapid and ultrasensitive quantitation of low-abundance analyte and thus holds promising potential in food, medical and environmental applications.

AB A highly selective, label-free sensor for the non-Hodgkin lymphoma gene, with an aM detection limit, utilizing electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) is presented. The sensor consists of a conducting electrospun fibre mat, surface-grafted with poly(acrylic acid) (PAA) brushes and a conducting polymer sensing element with covalently attached oligonucleotide probes. The sensor was fabricated from electrospun NBR rubber, embedded with poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT), followed by grafting poly(acrylic acid) brushes and then electrochemically polymerizing a conducting polymer monomer with ssDNA probe sequence pre-attached. The resulting non-Hodgkin lymphoma gene sensor showed a detection limit of 1 aM (1 x 10(-18) mol/L), more than 400 folds lower compared to a thin-film analogue. The sensor presented extraordinary selectivity, with only 1%, 2.7% and 4.6% of the signal recorded for the fully non-complimentary, T-A and G-C base mismatch oligonucleotide sequences, respectively. We suggest that such greatly enhanced selectivity is due to the presence of negatively charged carboxylic acid moieties from PAA grafts that electrostatically repel the non-complementary and mismatch DNA sequences, overcoming the non-specific binding.

AB Polynucleotide kinase (PNK) plays an essential role in cellular nucleic acid metabolism and the cellular response to DNA damage. However, conventional methods for PNK assay suffer from low sensitivity and involve multiple steps. Herein, we develop a simply electrochemical method for sensitive detection of PNIC activity on the basis of Au nanoparticle (AuNP)-mediated lambda exonuclease cleavage-induced signal amplification. We use [Ru(NH3)(6)](3+) as the electrochemically active indicator and design two DNA strands (i.e., strand 1 and strand 2) to sense PNK. The assembly of strand 2 on the AuNP surface leads to the formation of AuNP-strand 2 conjugates which can be subsequently immobilized on the gold electrode through the hybridization of strand 1 with strand 2 for the generation of a high electrochemical signal. The presence of PNK induces the phosphorylation of the strand 2-strand 1 hybrid and the subsequent cleavage of double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) by lambda exonuclease, resulting in the release of AuNP-strand 2 conjugates and [Ru(NH3)6]3 from the gold electrode surface and consequently the decrease of electrochemical signal. The PNK activity can be simply monitored by the measurement of [Ru(NH3)(6)](3+.) peak current signal. This assay is very sensitive with a detection limit of as low as 7.762 x 10(-4) U mL(-)1 and exhibits a large dynamic range from 0.001 to 10 U mL(-)1. Moreover, this method can be used to screen the PNK inhibitors, and it shows excellent performance in real sample analysis, thus holding great potential for further applications in biological researches and clinic diagnosis.

AB In this paper, a dual-target electrochemical aptasensor has been developed for simultaneous detection of carcinoembryonic antigen and mucin-1 based on metal ion electrochemical labels and Ru(NH3)(6)(3+) electronic wires. When targets are present, the interaction between targets and their respective aptamers leads to the dissociation of double-strand DNA because the targets have higher affinity to its aptamer than the complementary strand. And the qualitative and quantitative analyses of the two targets are realized by the differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) peaks generated by metal ion electrochemical labels. For the effective loading of a large number of metal ions, Au/bovine serum albumin (Au/BSA) nanospheres are employed as carriers to develop Au/BSA metal ions. After Ru(NH3)(6)(3+) complexes are embedded into double-strand DNA to form the electronic wires, the electrical conductivity and the electron transfer of the detection system are greatly improved. The detection limit of the proposed assay was calculated as 3.33 fM ranging from 0.01 pM to 100 nM. Therefore, this novel sensing assay provides a new and sensitive platform for detecting several targets simultaneously in biochemical research and clinical diagnosis.

AB A label-free photoelectrochemical (PEC) platform with high visible-light activity for quantitative detection of the ochratoxin A(OTA) was developed by assembly of Ag2S nanoparticles (NPs) sensitized on titanium dioxide/red blood cell-like shape bismuth vanadate (TiO2/S-BiVO4) electrode via layer-by-layer (LBL) strategy. In this protocol, ascorbic acid was used as an efficient electron donor for scavenging photo-generated holes and inhibiting light driven electron-hole pair recombination. TiO2 has good photoelectric activity and large surface area. The S-BiVO4 with porous structure surfaces can contribute to the high photocurrent intensity under visible-light irradiation. Moreover, the Ag2S NPs were in-situ growth on surfaces of thioglycolic acid modified SBiVO4, which enhanced photocurrent response and further improved the photocurrent conversion efficiency. Under optimal conditions, the PEC immunosensor exhibited a wide linear concentration range from 5 pg m(-1) to 750 ng mL(-1), with a low detection limit of 1.7 pg mL(-1) (S/N = 3) for OTA. Additionally, the designed immunosensor was performed with good stability, reproducibility and selectivity, thus opening up a new promising PEC platform for some other small molecules analysis.

AB A molecularly imprinted electrochemical sensor for neuron specific enolase (NSE) was developed by electrochemical polymerizing ionic liquid, which was functionalized with pyrrole moiety, in between gold nanoarrays. A well-defined 3D structured gold nanoarray was fabricated on a glassy carbon electrode (GCE) surface by using template-assisted electrochemical deposition technique. 1-(3-mercaptopropyl)-3-vinyl-imidazolium tetrafluoroborate was self-assembled onto the surface of gold nanoarrays to produce active sites for anchoring the molecularly imprinted film. Subsequently, an electrochemical polymerization procedure was carried out in an aqueous solution containing 1,3-di(3-N-pyrrolpropyl)imidazolium bromine ionic liquid and neuron specific enolase (NSE). After removing NSE templates, a molecularly imprinted, sensor was successfully fabricated. The sensor showed high selectivity and sensitivity towards NSE, produced a linear response in the concentration range from 0.01 to 1.0 ng mL(-1) and had a detection limit of 2.6 pg mL(-1) with an incubation time of 15 min. The developed sensor was demonstrated successful in determining NSE in clinical serum samples.

AB The field of microfluidics holds great promise for the development of simple and portable lab-on-a-chip systems. The use of capillarity as a means of fluidic manipulation in lab-on-a-chip systems can potentially reduce the complexity of the instrumentation and allow the development of user-friendly devices for point-of-need analyses. In this work, a PDMS microchannel-based, colorimetric, autonomous capillary chip provides a multiplexed and semi-quantitative immunodetection assay. Results are acquired using a standard smartphone camera and analyzed with a simple gray scale quantification procedure. The performance of this device was tested for the simultaneous detection of the mycotoxins ochratoxin A (OTA), aflatmdn B1 (AFB1) and deoxynivalenol (DON) which are strictly regulated food contaminants with severe detrimental effects on human and animal health. The multiplexed assay was performed approximately within 10 min and the achieved sensitivities of < 40, 0.1-0.2 and < 10 ng/mL for OTA, AFB1 and DON, respectively, fall within the majority of currently enforced regulatory and/or recommended limits. Furthermore, to assess the potential of the device to analyze real samples, the immunoassay was successfully validated for these 3 mycotoxins in a corn-based feed sample after a simple sample preparation procedure.

AB A tetrameric streptavidin (SA)-appended LPETG tag was site-specifically linked to azido-containing tri-glycine via sortase A catalysis and the resulting azido-modified SA (SA-N3) was retained in the biotin-binding pocket. SA-N3 was polymerized with dibenzylcyclooctyne-modified branched poly(ethyleneglycol) (DBCO-PEG) using azido-modified branched PEG (N3-PEG) as a spacer via copper-free click chemistry. The resulting SA-based hydrogel exhibited gel-like mechanical properties and could immobilize biotin-modified molecules through biotin-SA affinity. Glucose dehydrogenase (GDH) was immobilized in the SA-based hydrogel, and the hydrogel was then coated on a glassy carbon electrode (GCE) and used for the biocatalytic oxidation of glucose. The designed GCE exhibited better performance and stability compared with GDH chemically adsorbed onto a GCE. In addition, the designed GCE anode and a Pt-carbon cathode were assembled into a glucose/O-2 fuel cell that provided a maximum power density and open circuit voltage of 11.8 +/- 0.56 W cm(-2) and 0.17 V, respectively.

AB Fluorinated tripodal compounds were recently reported to be efficient transmembrane transporters for a series of inorganic anions. In particular, this class of receptors has been shown to be suitable for the effective complexation of chloride, nitrate, bicarbonate and sulfate anions via hydrogen bonding. The potentiometric properties of urea and thiourea-based fluorinated tripodal receptors are explored here for the first time, in light of the need for reliable sensors for chloride monitoring in undiluted biological fluids. The ion selective electrode (ISE) membranes with tren-based tris-urea bis(CF3) tripodal compound (ionophore I) were found to exhibit the best selectivity for chloride over major lipophilic anions such as salicylate (log K-Cl-/Sal-(pot) = + 1.0) and thiocyanate (log K-Cl-/SCN-(pot) = + 0.1). Ionophore I-based ISEs were successfully applied for chloride determination in undiluted human serum as well as artificial serum sample, the slope of the linear calibration at the relevant background of interfering ions being close to Nernstian (49.8 +/- 1.7 mV). The results of potentiometric measurements were confirmed by argentometric titration. Moreover, the ionophore I-based ISE membrane was shown to exhibit a very good long-term stability of potentiometric performance over the period of 10 weeks. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) titrations, potentiometric sandwich membrane experiments and density functional theory (DFT) computational studies were performed to determine the binding constants and suggest 1:1 complexation stoichiometry for the ionophore I with chloride as well as salicylate.

AB The quality of graphene strongly affects the performance of graphene-based biosensors which are highly demanded for the sensitive and selective detection of biomolecules, such as DNA. This work reported a novel transfer process for preparing a residue-free graphene film using a thin gold supporting layer. A Hall effect device made of this gold-transferred graphene was demonstrated to significantly enhance the sensitivity (approximate to 5 times) for hybridization detection, with a linear detection range of 1 pM to 100 nM for DNA target. Our findings provide an efficient method to boost the sensitivity of graphene-based biosensors for DNA recognition.

AB A novel and competitive electrochemiluminescence (ECL) aptasensor for prostate specific antigen (PSA) assay was constructed using gold nanorods functionalized graphene oxide (GO@AuNRs) multilabeled with glucose oxidase (GOD) and streptavidin (SA) toward luminol-based ECL system. A strong initial ECL signal was achieved by electrodeposited gold (DpAu) on the electrode because of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) motivating the luminol ECL signal. The signal probes prepared by loading GOD and SA-biotin-DNA on GO@AuNRs were used for achieving multiple signal amplification. In the absence of PSA, the signal probes can be attached on the electrode by hybridization reaction between PSA aptamer and biotin-DNA. In this state, the GOD loaded on the probe could catalyze glucose to in situ produce H2O2 and then AuNRs catalyze H2O2 to generate abundant reactive oxygen species (ROSs) in luminol ECL reaction. Both the high-content GOD and AuNRs in the signal probe amplified the ECL signal in the ECL system. Moreover, the combination of SA with biotin-DNA further expands ECL intensity. The integration of such amplifying effects in this protocol endows the aptasensor with high sensitivity and good selectivity for PSA detection. This aptasensor exhibits a linear relation in the range of 0.5 pg mL(-1) to 5.0 ng mL(-1) with the detection limit of 0.17 pg mL(-1) (S/N = 3). Besides, the strategy was successfully applied in determination of human serum samples with recovery of 81.4-116.0%.

AB Engineering of neural interface with nanomaterials for high spatial resolution neural recording and stimulation is still hindered by materials properties and modification methods. Recently, poly(3,4-ethylene-dioxythiophene) (PEDOT) has been widely used as an electrode-tissue interface material for its good electrochemical property. However, cracks and delamination of PEDOT film under pulse stimulation are found which restrict its long-term applications. This paper develops a flexible electrochemical method about the co-deposition of graphene with PEDOT on microelectrode sites to enhance the long-term stability and improve the electrochemical properties of microelectrode. This method is unique and profound because it co-deposits graphene with PEDOT on microelectrode sites directly and avoids the harmful post reduction process. And, most importantly, significantly improved electrochemical performances of the modified microelectrodes (compared to PEDOT-GO) are demonstrated due to the large effective surface area, good conductivity and excellent mechanical property of graphene. Furthermore, the good mechanical stability of the composites is verified by ultrasonication and CV scanning tests. In-vivo acute implantation of the microelectrodes reveals the modified microelectrodes show higher recording performance than the unmodified ones. These findings suggest the composites are excellent candidates for the applications of neural interface.

AB A dual-function platinum disc microelectrode sensor was used for in-situ monitoring of H2O2 produced in A. tequilana leaves after inoculation of their endophytic bacteria (Enterobacter cloacae). Voltammetric experiments were carried out from 0.0 to -1.0 V, a potential range where H2O2 is electrochemically reduced. A needle was used to create a small cavity in the upper epidermis of A. tequilana leaves, where the fabricated electrochemical sensor was inserted by using a manual three-dimensional micropositioner. Control experiments were performed with untreated plants and the obtained electrochemical results clearly proved the formation of H2O2 in the leaves of plants 3 h after the E. cloacae inoculation, according to a mechanism involving endogenous signaling pathways. In order to compare the sensitivity of the microelectrode sensor, the presence of H2O2 was detected in the root hairs by 3,3-diaminobenzidine (DAB) stain 72 h after bacterial inoculation. In-situ pH measurements were also carried out with a gold disc microelectrode modified with a film of iridium oxide and lower pH values were found in A. tequilana leaves treated with bacteria, which may indicate the plant produces acidic substances by biosynthesis of secondary metabolites. This microsensor could be an advantageous tool for further studies on the understanding of the mechanism of H2O2 production during the plant-endophyte interaction.

AB Iron deficiency (ID) is an urgent public health problem that has devastating effects on maternal and child health. However, due to poor access and affordability, screening and diagnosis for ID is often limited to proxy hemoglobin measurements alone. Here, we report the development and validation of ironPhone, a mobile device coupled portable diagnostics for quantification of serum ferritin concentrations, an iron status biomarker, within a few minutes, from a drop of fingerprick blood. The ironPhone diagnostic platform comprises of a smartphone accessory, an app, and a disposable lateral flow immunoassay test strip to quantify serum ferritin. For initial validation in the lab, we optimized and evaluated the performance of ironPhone with known ferritin concentrations in spiked buffer and serum samples. Following lab validation, we performed a human validation by collecting fingerprick whole blood samples from 20 participants to assess iron status using ironPhone and compared the results with the laboratory standard IMMULITE 2000 analyzer. Findings from the ironPhone for the buffer and spiked serum samples provided a calibration curve with R-2 values of 0.97 (n=27) and 0.93 (n=12), respectively. On comparison with the laboratory standard IMMULITE analyzer in whole blood samples, a correlation of 0.92 (P < 0.0001) was observed with a sensitivity of over 90% for predicting ID (ferritin < 15.0 mu g/L) via the ironPhone, demonstrating its promise for iron status assessment at the point-of-care.

AB Discovery of biosensors has acquired utmost importance in the field of healthcare. Recent advances in biological techniques and instrumentation involving nanomaterials, surface plasmon resonance, and aptasensors have developed innovative biosensors over classical methods. Integrated approaches provided a better perspective for developing specific and sensitive devices with wide potential applications. Type 2 diabetes mellitus is a complex disease affecting almost every tissue and organ system, with metabolic complications extending far beyond impaired glucose metabolism. Although there is no known cure for Type 2 diabetes, early diagnosis and interventions are critical to prevent this disease and can postpone or even prevent the serious complications that are associated with diabetes. Biomarkers for type 2 diabetes are useful for prediction and intervention of the disease at earlier stages. Proper selection of biomarkers that represent health and disease states is vital for disease diagnosis and treatment by detecting it before it manifests. In this respect, we provide an overview of different types of biosensors being used, ranging from electrochemical, fluorescence-based, nanomonitors, SPR-based, and field-effect transistor biosensors for early detection and management of diabetes with focus on prediabetes. In the future, novel non-invasive technologies combined with blood and tissue-based biomarkers will enable the detection, prevention, and treatment of diabetes and its complications long before overt disease develops.

AB Herein, the self-cleaned electrochemical protein imprinting biosensor basing on a thermo-responsive memory hydrogel was constructed on a glassy carbon electrode (GCE) with a free radical polymerization method. Combining the advantages of thermo-responsive molecular imprinted polymers and electrochemistry, the resulted biosensor presents a novel self-cleaned ability for bovine serum albumin (BSA) in aqueous media. As a temperature controlled gate, the hydrogel film undergoes the adsorption and desorption of BSA basing on a reversible structure change with the external temperature stimuli. In particular, these processes have been revealed by the response of cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) of electroactive [Fe(CN)(6)](3-/4-). The results have been supported by the evidences of scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and contact angles measurements. Under the optimal conditions, a wide detection range from 0.02 mu mol L-1 to 10 mu mol L-1 with a detection limit of 0.012 mu mol L-1 (S/N = 3) was obtained for BSA. This proposed BSA sensor also possesses high selectivity, excellent stability, acceptable recovery and good reproducibility in its practical applications.

AB Stimuli-responsive carriers have extensively attracted attention in recent years. However, long-term and real-time tracking ability with stimuli-responsive carrier is still in its infant stage due to the limitations such as, low efficacy, instability and cytotoxicity in a bio-environment. In this work, we developed a reduction-sensitive carrier composed of lipoic acid-modified low molecular weight polyethyleneimine (LA-PEI) and large surface ratio MoS2 nanosheet integrated via disulfide bond to mimic a high molecular weight PEI. The positively charged carriers loading negatively charged aptamer enter the cells for a real time long-term tracking of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) metabolism in glioma stem cells (GSCs) when stimulated by TGF beta factor secreted from HUVECs. We envision that MoS2-LA-PEI carrier has a promising potential for delivery and monitoring the changes in live cells with low cytotoxicity and high efficiency.

AB A novel fully disposable microfluidic electrochemical array device (mu FED) was developed and successfully applied for detection of the biomarker estrogen receptor alpha (ERa). The FED was constructed using low-cost materials and an inexpensive home cutter printer enabled the manufacture of dozens of mu FEDs in less than 2 h, at a cost of less than US$ 0.20 in material per device. The FED incorporates counter and reference electrodes and eight carbon-based working electrodes, which were modified with DNA sequences known as estrogen response elements (DNA-ERE), where ERa binds specifically. Paramagnetic particles heavily decorated with anti-ER alpha antibody and horseradish peroxidase (MP-Ab-HRP) were used to efficiently capture ERa from the sample solution. The ER alpha-MP-Ab-HRP bioconjugate formed was injected into the FED and incubated with the DNA-ERE-modified electrodes, followed by amperometric detection with application of -0.2 V vs. Ag vertical bar AgCl while a mixture of H2O2 and hydroquinone was injected into the microfluidic device. An ultralow limit of detection of 10.0 fg mL(-1) was obtained with the proposed method. The performance of the assay, in terms of sensitivity and reproducibility, was studied using undiluted calf serum, and excellent recoveries in the range of 94.7-108% were achieved for the detection of ERa in MCF-7 cell lysate. The FED system can be easily constructed and applied for multiplex biomarker detection, making the device an excellent cost-effective alternative for cancer diagnosis, especially in developing countries.

AB Herein, a resettable and reprogrammable biomolecular keypad lock on the basis of a closed bipolar electrode (BPE) system was established. In this system, one ITO electrode with immobilized chitosan (CS) and glucose oxidase (GOD), designated as CS-GOD, acted as one pole of BPE in the sensing cell; another ITO with electrodeposited Prussian blue (PB) films as the other pole in the reporting cell. The addition of ascorbic acid (AA) in the sensing cell with driving voltage (V-tot) at +2.5 V would make the PB films become Prussian white (PW) in the reporting cell, accompanied by the color change from blue to nearly transparent. On the other hand, with the help of oxygen, the addition of glucose in the sensing cell with Vtot at 1.5 V would induce PW back to PB. The change of color and the corresponding UV vis absorbance at 700 nm for the PB/PW films in the reporting cell could be reversibly switched by changing the solute in the sensing cell between AA and glucose and then switching Vtot between +2.5 and 1.5 V. Based on these, a keypad lock was developed with AA, glucose and V-tot as 3 inputs, and the color change of the PB/PW films as the output. This keypad lock system combined enzymatic catalysis with bipolar electrochemistry, demonstrating some unique advantages such as good reprogrammability, easy resettability and visual readout by naked eye.

AB An implementation of neutralized chimeric DNA oligomer as a probe for sensitive detection of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on a surface plasmon resonance imaging sensor is investigated. The chimeric DNA oligomer was synthesized in a conventional DNA synthesizer, containing neutral nucleotides with a methylated phosphate group. The secondary structures and melting points of the chimeric DNA fragment and its complexes with perfect-matched and single-mismatched complementary DNA molecules were examined by using circular dichroism and UV vis spectroscopy in comparison with the native probe DNA counterpart. The results indicate that the chimeric DNA complexes can form a B-form structure and exhibit high thermostability. Moreover, the hybridization and discrimination efficiency of the chimeric probe DNA for the SNP genotyping were verified by using the SPRi sensor under different experimental conditions. The data reveal the effects of the ionic strength and operation temperature on the selectivity of the chimeric probe DNA for the SNP detection. The hybridization condition with a low ionic strength and high temperature allows the chimeric probe DNA distinguishing perfect-matched and single-mismatched target DNA molecules to the best extent, likely due to the reduced electrostatic repulsive force and presence of the additional methyl group on the backbone. Consequently, the direct and label-free detection with the SPR technique and neutralized chimeric probe DNA can be realized for the SNP genotyping by optimizing the operation condition and sequence design.

AB Point-of-care detection of human enterovirus 71 (EV71), the major pathogen that causes hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD) among children, is urgently needed for early diagnosis and control of related epidemics. A colorimetric and electrochemical immunosensor for point-of-care detection of EV71 has been developed based on dual-labeled magnetic nanobeads amplification. The dual-labeled magnetic nanobeads (DL-MBs) are fabricated by simultaneous immobilization of EV71 monoclonal antibody (mAb) and horseradish peroxidase (HRP) on magnetic nanobeads. By capturing EV71 virions in 20 mu L., sample on mAb modified AuNPs-coated ITO electrode and subsequently binding with DL-MBs, with the addition of TMB and H2O2, colorimetric signals corresponding to EV71 with a concentration of 1.0 ng mL(-1) can be directly read out by naked eyes, making it possible towards point-of care detection of the virus. Furthermore, on the reduction of oxidized TMB on the electrode, electrochemical signal can be detected in the same detection cell without solution transfer, with a detection limit of 0.01 ng mL(-1). Validated with clinical samples, the colorimetric and electrochemical immunosensor shows a complete consistency with reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) results. So far as we know, this is the first report on EV71 detection using electrochemical method. The merits of this assay, including high sensitivity, ability for colorimetric detection and easy to operation, ensure a promising future in point-of-care diagnostics of virus related diseases.

AB The exploration of electroactive labelling with tailorable and strong differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) responses is of great importance in accurate and sensitive screening of a panel of biomarkers related to cancer. Herein, shell-encoded gold nanoparticles (Au NPs) are fabricated and give rise to shell species-dominated DPV peak potentials. Two independent DPV peaks appear at -0.08 V for Au Cu2O core-shell NPs and 0.26 V for Au Ag core-shell NPs. Shell-encoded Au NPs drastically exhibit shell thickness-tunable amplified peak currents. The non-interfering and amplified DPV responses enable shell-encoded Au NPs to be an alternative electrochemical signal amplifier for dual screening of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and alpha-fetoprotein (APP). The limits of detection (LODs) are calculated to be 1.8 pg/mL for CEA and 0.3 pg/mL for AFP. In comparison to the parallel single-analyte assays, shell-encoded Au NPs engineered electrochemical aptasensors offer multiplexing capability and show significant prospects in biomedical research and early diagnosis of diseases.

AB In this paper, we reported a sensitive and selective electrochemical method for quantify DNA methylation, analyzing DNA MTase activity and screening of MTase inhibitor based on silver nanoparticles (Ag NPs) decorated carbon nanocubes (CNCs) as signal tag. The Ag NPs/CNCs was prepared by in situ growth of nanosilver on carboxylated CNCs and used as a tracing tag to label antibody. The sensor was prepared by immobilizing the double DNA helix structure on the surface of gold electrode. When DNA MTase was introduced, the probe was methylated. Successively, anti-5-methylcytosine antibody labeled Ag NPs/CNCs was specifically conjugated on the CpG methylation site. The electrochemical stripping signal of the Ag NPs was used to monitor the activity of MTase. The electrochemical signal has a linear relationship with M.SssI activities ranging from 0.05 to 120 U/mL with a detection limit of 0.03 U/mL. In addition, we also demonstrated the method could be used for rapid evaluation and screening of the inhibitors of MTase. The newly designed strategy avoid the requirement of deoxygenation for electrochemical assay, and thus provide a promising potential in clinical application.

AB In the quest of greater sensitivity and specificity of diagnostic systems, one continually searches for alternative DNA hybridization methods, enabling greater versatility and where possible field-enabled detection of target analytes. We present, herein, a hybrid molecular self-assembled scaffolded DNA origami entity, intimately immobilized via capture probes linked to aminopropyltriethoxysilane, onto a glass optical fiber end-face transducer, thus producing a novel biosensor. Immobilized DNA nanorobots with a switchable flap can then be actuated by a specific target DNA present in a sample, by exposing a hemin/G-quadruplex DNAzyme, which then catalyzes the generation of chemiluminescence, once the specific fiber probes are immersed in a luminol-based solution. Integrating organic nanorobots to inorganic fiber optics creates a hybrid system that we demonstrate as a proof-of-principle can be utilized in specific DNA sequence detection.

AB A highly stable electrochemical acetylcholinesterase (AChE) biosensor for detection of organophosphorus pesticides (OPs) was developed simply by adsorption of AChE on chitosan (CS), TiO2 sol-gel, and reduced graphene oxide (rGO) based multi-layered immobilization matrix (denoted as (CSTiO2)-Ti-@-CS/rGO). The biosensor fabrication conditions were optimized, and the fabrication process was probed and confirmed by scanning electron microscopy and electrochemical techniques. The matrix has a mesoporous nanostructure. Incorporation of CS and electrodeposition of a CS layer into/on the TiO2 sol-gel makes the gel become mechanically strong. The catalytic activity of the AChE immobilized (CSTiO2)-Ti-@-CS/rGO/glassy carbon electrode to acetylthiocholine is significantly higher than those missing any one of the component in the matrix. The detection linear range of the biosensor to dichlorvos, a model OP compound, is from 0.036 mu M (7.9 ppb) to 22.6 mu M, with a limit of detection of 29 nM (6.4 ppb) and a total detection time of about 25 min. The biosensor is very reproducibly and stable both in detection and in storage, and can accurately detect the dichlorvos levels in cabbage juice samples, providing an efficient platform for immobilization of AChE, and a promisingly applicable OPs biosensor with high reliability, simplicity, and rapidness.

AB Liposomes are an excellent candidate component for biosensors to transduce and amplify detection signals due to their outstanding ability in encapsulating signal marker compounds. However, the use of liposomes for photoelectrochemical (PEC) signal transduction has not yet been achieved due the lack of appropriate sensing strategy. Herein, we report on a novel liposomes-amplified PEC immunoassay (LAPIA) method for sensitive HIV-p24 antigen (p24) detection based on a split-type strategy. Initially, liposomes were encapsulated with alkaline phosphatase (ALP) in their hydrophilic chamber and conjugated with secondary antibody on the surface to form the ALP-encapsulated liposomes (ALP-Ls) based PEC signal label. Sandwiched immunoassay based on the ALP-Ls label was then carried out in microwell plate. Upon addition of tween 20, the ALP molecules were released and catalyzed the hydrolysis of ascorbic acid 2-phosphate (AA-p) to produce ascorbic acid (AA). The latter then donated electron to the graphene/g-C3N4 nanohybrids based photoelectrode, arousing an increased photocurrent signal. The separation of immunoreaction step and PEC signal excitation (i.e. split type) not only enabled the realization of liposomes based amplification strategy, but also could eliminate the PEC-caused biomolecules damage. The developed PEC method possessed a wide calibration range from 1.0 pg m171 to 50 ng mL(-1) and a low detection limit of 0.63 pg mL(-1). Its practicability was demonstrated.by assaying human serum samples. Moreover, the universality of the liposomes-amplified PEC sensing strategy was also demonstrated by developing it into a sensitive microRNA detection method.

AB Ochratoxin A (OTA) is one of the most widespread and dangerous food contaminants. Therefore, rapid, label free and precise detection of low OTA concentrations requires novel gensing elements with advanced bioanalytical properties. In the present paper we report photoluminescence (PL) based immunosensor for the detection of OTA. During the development of immunosensor photoluminescent ZnO nanorods (ZnO-NRs) were deposited on glass substrate. Then the ZnO-NRs were silanized and covalently modified by Protein-A (Glass/ ZnO-NRs/Protein-A). The latest structure was modified by antibodies against OTA (Anti-OTA) in order to form OTA-selective layer (Glass/ZnO-NRs/Protein-A/Anti-OTA). In order to improve immunosensors selectivity the surface of Glass/ZnO-NRs/Protein-A/Anti-OTA was additionally blocked by BSA. Formed Glass/ZnO-NRs/ Protein-A/BSA &Anti-OTA structures were integrated within portable fiber optic detection system, what is important for the development of low cost and portable immunosensors. The immunosensor has been tested in a wide range of OTA concentrations from 10(-4) ng/ml until 20 ng/ml. Interaction isotherms were derived from atialytical signals of immunosensor. Association constant and Gibbs free energy for the interaction of Glass/ ZnO-NRs/Protein-A/Anti-OTA with OTA were calculated, analyzed and compared with some other related results. Sensitivity range and limit of detection were determined as 0.1(-1) ng/ml and 10(-2) ng/ml, respectively. Interaction kinetics of ZnO-NRs with OTA was evaluated. Response time of the immunosensor toward OTA was in the range of 500-800 s. Some insights related to the mechanism of PL-signal generation are proposed and discussed.

AB Fluorescent sensory MIP (molecularly imprinted polymer) particles were combined with a droplet-based 3D microfluidic system for the selective determination of a prototype small-molecule analyte of environmental concern, 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid or 2,4-D, at nanomolar concentration directly in water samples. A tailor-made fluorescent indicator cross-linker was thus designed that translates the binding event directly into an enhanced fluorescence signal. The phenoxazinone-type cross-linker was co-polymerized into a thin MIP layer grafted from the surface of silica microparticles following a RAFT (reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer) polymerization protocol. While the indicator cross-linker outperformed its corresponding monomer twin, establishment of a phase-transfer protocol was essential to guarantee that the hydrogen bond-mediated signalling mechanism between the urea binding site on the indicator cross-linker and the carboxylate group of the analyte was still operative upon real sample analysis. The latter was achieved by integration of the fluorescent core-shell MIP sensor particles into a modular microfluidic platform that allows for an in-line phase transfer assay, extracting the analyte from aqueous sample droplets into the organic phase that contains the sensor particles. Real-time fluorescence determination of 2,4-D down to 20 nM was realized with the system and applied for the analysis of various surface water samples collected from different parts of the world.

AB In this work, photoelectrochemical (PEC) sensors based on carbon dots (CDs) were developed for ultrasensitive detection of glutathione (GSH) without additional catalysts. In this PEC sensing system, CDs exhibited both photoelectric and catalytic properties. Silver nanoparticles (AgNPs), graphene oxide (GO), and mesoporous silica (MS) were introduced in order to enhance the sensing properties of CDs for GSH. Among the different hybrid nanocomposites, CDs@MS based PEC sensors exhibited the best sensing properties: the sensitivity and limit of detection (LOD) for GSH were found to be 57.6 nA mu M-1 1 and 6.2 nM (S/N = 3), respectively, in the linear range 0.02-4 mu M. In addition, the developed PEC sensors showed a high selectivity for GSH even with interferences of other biological thiols and amino acids. The PEC sensor was successfully applied for GSH detection in human serum and probing of myocardial infarction (MI) conditions by estimating the amount of GSH in the myocardial cells of mice, which had been treated with different ischemia/ischernia-reperfusion times. These results indicated that the CDs based hybrid nanocomposites are promising candidates for the development of PEC biosensors with enhanced sensing performances.

AB A novel molecularly imprinted silica layer,appended to FeSe quantum dots (MIP-FeSe-QDs) was fabricated and utilized as a recognition element to develop a selective and sensitive fluorescent nanosensor for cyfluthrin (CYF) determination. The MIP-FeSe-QDs were characterized by fluorescence spectrometry, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. Excellent selectivity and high sensitivity of MIP-FeSe-QDs to CYF molecules were observed based on the fluorescence quenching of FeSe-QDs. Under optimal conditions, a good linear relationship was found between fluorescence quenching effect and increased CYF concentration within 0.010-0.20 mg/L, with a correlation coefficient of 0.9911. The practicality of the developed sensor method for CYF detection in fish and sediment samples was further validated. Good recoveries ranging from 88.0% to 113.9% with < 6.8% relative standard deviations were obtained. The detection limits of CYF in sediment and fish samples were 1.3 and 1.9 mu g/kg, respectively. This study established a novel, rapid fluorescent nanosensor detection method based on MIP-QDs for successfully analyzing CYF in fish and sediment samples.

AB Luminescent gold nanoclusters (AuNCs) synthesized using non-thiolate DNA ligands were reported to show both optical and structure responses toward diethyposphorthioate (DEP) derived from the hydrolysis of chlorpyrifos (CP). After incubation of AuNCs with DEP, the non-thiolate DNA ligands were immediately replaced and the tiny AuNCs with ultrasmall size transformed gradually to plasmonic nanoparticles, which resulted in significant luminescence quenching of the AuNCs, offering a new possibility to selectively detect organophosphorothioate pesticides that could be easily hydrolyzed to form the special structures such as DEP containing two binding sites (e.g. S and 0 atoms). Therefore, selecting CP as a model analyte, we here developed a general strategy for the construction of a novel chemosensor for the determination of CP using the nonthiolate DNA coated AuNCs as an optical probe. Based on aggregation-induced luminescence quenching, this strategy exhibited highly sensitive and selective responses towards CP with a limit of detection (LOD) of 0.50 mu M, and was applied successfully to the analysis of CP in real sample. More interestingly, this facile strategy could easily distinguish CP from other thiol reagents through solution color change in spite of the existence of the coordination between Au and S atom for both of them, and the response mechanisms for them were studied in detail. In additional, it could be extended to detect the other organophosphorothioate pesticides with the similar structure as CP, which exploits a new platform for the construction of chemosensor and application.

AB A novel, simple and sensitive photoelectrochemical (PEC) immunosensing platform was constructed for detecting N-6-methyladenosine (m(6)A) based on the carboxylated CN and avidin functionalized Ru@SiO2 CARS) nanocomposite. Herein, the N-6-methyladenosine-5'-triphosphate (m(6)ATP) was selected as the detection target molecule, m6A antibody was used as recognition unit for m(6)A, the carboxylated g-C3N4 (CN) was not only used as the photoactive substance, but the substrate for the m(6)A antibody immobilization, ARS was synthesized and used as signal amplification unit to improve the photocurrent of CN, Phos-tag-biotin was employed as bridge of m6ATP and Ru@SiO2 through the specific interaction between phosphate group of m(6)ATP and Phos-tag, biotin and avidin, respectively. Under the optimal condition, the fabricated PEC biosensor showed a linear range of 0.01-10 nM and high detection sensitivity with low detection limit of 3.23 pM for m(6)ATP. Besides, the developed strategy was also successfully applied to evaluate the content of m(6)A in human serum samples.

AB Cholera toxin is a major virulent agent of Vibrio cholerae, and it can rapidly lead to severe dehydration, shock, causing death within hours without appropriate clinical treatments. In this study, we present a method wherein unique and short peptides that bind to cholera toxin subunit B (CD-B) were selected through M13 phage display. Biopanning over recombinant CIX-B led to rapid screening of a unique peptide with an amino acid sequence of VQCRLGPPWCAIC, and the phage-displayed peptides analyzed using ELISA, were found to show specific affinities towards CTX-B. To address the use of affinity peptides in development of the biosensor, sequences of newly selected peptides were modified and chemically synthesized to create a series of affinity peptides. Performance of the biosensor was studied using plasmonic-based optical techniques: localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) and surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERB). The limit of detection (LOD) obtained by LSPR with 3a-rule was 1.89 ng/mL, while SERS had a LOD of 3.51 pg/mL. In both cases, the sensitivity was much higher than the previously reported values, and our sensor system was specific towards actual CIX-B secreted from V. cholera, but not for CTX-AB5.

AB Donor-Acceptor (D-A) structure like host-guest pair serves as an organic charge-transfer (C-T) material with pregnant electrochemical and photochemical properties. Phenothiazine, a conjugated nitrogen-sulfur hetero-cyclic compound with broad pharmaceutical profile, is a strong electron donating system and applied in the synthesis of various classic antipsychotic drugs. In this proposal, a novel D-A molecule, 2,3-bis(4-(10H-phenothiazin-10-yl)phenyl)fumaronitrile (PTBFN), containig a diphenylfumaronitrile as the electrophilic central core and two phenothiazines as the peripheral electron donor functional groups is first designed and synthesized. Subsequently, the C-T layer based on the PTBFN polymer, poly(PTBFN), is obtained via a straightforward electrochemical method and used as an efficient electrocatalyst for dopamine (DA) detection. The logarithm of oxidation peak currents present an outstanding linear response to that of the DA concentration varying from 0.005 to 350 mu M with a detection limit down to 0.70 nM, wherein the interferences of uric acid (UA) and ascorbic acid (AA) could be eliminated effectively. Moreover, the biosensor displays decent stability, excellent selectivity for different interfering compounds and applicability in real samples analysis. The favorable sensing performance suggests that the nontrivial D-A architecture is one of the promising bioaffinity catalysts for electrocatalysis and expected to provide wider application potential for biosensing construction and medical diagnostics.

AB A facile, economical and one-step hydrothermal method is used to synthesize highly durable fluorescent nitrogen-doped carbon dots (FNCDs) by utilizing Phyllanthus acidus (P. acidus) and aqueous ammonia as the carbon and nitrogen sources, respectively. The synthesized FNCDs have an average size of 4.5 +/- 1 nm and showed bright blue fluorescence under the irradiation of UV-light at an excitation wavelength of 365 inn. It exhibits a quantum yield (QY) of 14% at an excitation wavelength of 350 nm with maximum emission at 420 nm. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy characterizations clearly showed the formation of FNCDs that predominantly consists of nitrogen and hydroxyl groups which can provide more adsorption sites. In addition, the above study reveals the successful bonding of nitrogen with carbon (C-N) in the FNCDs. The synthesized FNCDs with high QY can be used as efficient fluorescent probes for the detection of Fe3+. Based on the linear relationship between normalized fluorescence intensity and concentration of Fe3+ ions, the prepared FNCDs can be used for label-free sensitive and selective detection of Fe3+ ions in a wide concentration range of 2-25 mu M with a detection limit of 0.9 mu M. The present study proves that synthesized FNCDs has durable fluorescence, soluble in water very well and thus act as a promising candidate for the diverse applications such as label-free sensitive and selective detection of Fe3+, fluorescent ink and cellular imaging with good biocompatibility and low cytotmdcity.

AB We report a smartphone label-free biosensor platform based on grating-coupled surface plasmon resonance (GC-SPR). The sensor system relies on the smartphone's built-in flash light source and camera, a disposable sensor chip with Au diffraction grating and a compact disk (CD) as the spectra dispersive unit. The Au grating sensor chip was modified with a synthetic peptide receptor and employed on the GC-SPR detection of lipopolysaccharides (known as endotoxins) with detection limit of 32.5 ng/mL in water. Upon incubation of various small and macro-molecules with the synthetic peptide modified sensor chips, we concluded the good selectivity of the sensor for LPS detection. In addition, the sensor shows feasibility for the detection of LPS in commonly used clinical injectable fluids, such as clinical-grade 0.9% sodium chloride intravenous infusion, compound sodium lactate intravenous infusion and insulin aspart. The developed sensor platform offers the advantage of portability and simplicity, which is attractive for point-of-care and remote detection of biomedical and environmental targets.

AB The development of effective method for monitoring of endogenous hypochlorous acid (HClO) in vivo is of great significance for early diagnosis of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induced acute liver injury. Herein, we report a polymer micelles-based ratiometric fluorescent probe (PM) based on the combination of intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) mechanism and fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) principle for selective visualization of endogenous HClO in vivo. Upon the reaction of PM with HClO, the electron-donating thiourea moiety is oxidized and transformed into imidazoline moiety (electron-withdrawing group), resulting in a dramatic blue shift (100 nm) in the fluorescence emission. The as-prepared PM shows good water dispersibility (100% aqueous media), fast response (<40 s), high sensitivity (a detection limit of 1.75 nM), and outstanding selectivity toward HClO over other ROS/RNS (50 equiv.). In addition, the vivo imaging experiments demonstrate that PM facilitates the visualization of endogenous HClO generation with LPS induced acute liver injury in zebrafish model.

AB A new sensing device was developed to achieve ultrahigh sensitivity, by coupling polymer micropillars with a quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) substrate to form a two-degree-of-freedom resonance system (QCM-P). The sensitivity of these QCM-P devices was evaluated by measuring mass changes for both deposited gold film and adsorption of bovine serum albumin (BSA), respectively, on poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) micropillar surfaces, as well as assessing ligand-analyte binding interactions between anti-human immunoglobulin G (antihIgG) and human immunoglobulin G (hIgG). The anti-hIgG and hIgG binding results show QCM-P achieved an eightfold improvement in sensitivity relative to conventional QCM sensors. In addition, the binding affinity obtained from the QCM-P device for anti-hIgG and hIgG proteins was found in good agreement with that measured by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) for the same binding reaction.

AB The fluorescent paper for colorimetric detection of metal ions has been widely fabricated using various sensing probes, but it still remains an elusive task to design a test paper with multicolor variation with target dosages for accurate determination. Herein, we report a profuse color-evolution-based fluorescent test paper sensor for rapid and visual monitoring of Cu2+ in human urine by printing tricolor probe onto filter paper. The tricolor probe consists of blue-emission carbon dots (bCDs), green-emission quantum dots (gQDs) and red-emission quantum dots (rQDs), which is based on the principle that the fluorescence of gQDs and rQDs are simultaneously quenched by Cu2+, whereas the bCDs as the photostable internal standard is insensitive to Cu2+. Upon the addition of different amounts of Cu2+, the ratiometric fluorescence intensity of the tricolor probe continuously varied, leading to color changes from shallow pink to blue with a detection limit of 1.3 nM. When the tricolor probe solution was printed onto a sheet of filter paper, as-obtained test paper displayed a more profuse color evolution from shallow pink to light salmon to dark orange to olive drab to dark olive green to slate blue to royal blue and to final dark blue with the increase of Cu2+ concentration compared with dual-color probe-based test paper, and dosage scale as low as 6.0 nM was clearly discriminated. The sensing test paper is simple, rapid and inexpensive, and serves as a visual platform for ultrasensitive monitoring of endogenous Cu2+ in human urine.

AB In this work, novel octahedral Cu2O-Au nanocomposites were synthesized and first applied in an electro-chemical aptasensor to detect thrombin (TB) with the aid of a DNAzyme for signal amplification. The octahedral Cu2O-Au nanocomposites have not only simultaneously served as signal amplifying molecules but have also been utilized as an ideal loading platform to immobilize a large number of electroactive substances and recognition probes. Gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) were grown directly on the surface of the octahedral Cu2O nanocrystals, and the Cu2O-Au nanocomposites obtained had the advantages of large surface areas and excellent biocompatibilities. The hemin/G-quadruplex, which was formed by intercalating hemin into the amino terminated thrombin binding aptamer (NH2-TBA), and the electroactive toluidine blue (Tb) were immobilized onto the Cu2O-Au nanocomposite surfaces through a stable Au-N bond. AuNPs, Cu2O and hemin/G-quadruplex co-catalyse the H2O2 in the working buffer to promote the electron transfer of Tb as a multiple signal amplification strategy in order to improve the performance of the electrochemical aptasensor. Under optimal conditions, the designed aptasensor exhibited sensitive detection of TB from 100 fM to 20 nM with a lower detection limit of 23fM. This proposed aptasensor exhibited good sensitivity, high specificity and acceptable reproducibility and could be widely applied in bioassay analysis.

AB A multiplex ultrasensitive electrochemiluminescence (ECL) immunoassay was developed for the simultaneous determination of two different tumor markers, cancer antigen 153 (CA 15-3) and cancer antigen 125 (CA 125) using polyamidoamine dendrimer-quantum dots (PAMAM-QDs) and PAMAM-sulfanilic acid-Ru(bpy)(3)(2+) as the signal probes and Fe3O4 SiO2 as a magnetic bead. The CdTe@CdS-QDs and Ru(bPY)(3)(2+) at the presence of tripropyl amine (TPA) as coreactant generate ECL at an applied voltage of + 1.2 V (vs Ag/AgCl) in two different wavelengths 500 and 620 nm, respectively. Based on this strategy, the simultaneous detection of two tumor markers in single run carried out. This dual signal amplification technique was achieved by employing Fe3O4@ SiO2-dendrimer as immunosensing platform and PAMAM as the carrier for immobilizing CdTe@CdS and Ru(bpy)(3)(2+) probes. Experimental results illustrated that the designed immunosensor can be used to sequentially detection of CA 125 and CA 15-3 markers with the wide linear ranges of 1 mu U/mL to 1 U/mL and 0.1 mU/mL to 100 U/mL with very low detection limits of 0.1 mu U/mL and 10 mu U/mL, respectively. The application of the immunosensor for simultaneous detection of CA125 and CA15-3 in human serum samples was evaluated and the obtained results were found to be in acceptable agreement with the those obtained with an ELISA assay as reference method. The proposed ECL immunosensor can provide a simple, sensitive and reliable approach for the simultaneous detection of tumor markers in clinical samples.

AB A paper-based microfluidic device based on unconventional principle was developed and used to detect lead ions through a two-step process including heated incubation and subsequent mixing. The device was made by generating a superhydrophobic pattern, which defines channel and reservoir barriers, on a water-impermeable paper substrate, followed by loading and drying the reagents in the defined reservoirs. Different from the conventional paper-based devices that are made of water-permeable paper, the as-prepared device holds watet drops in discrete reservoirs, and the water drops will not move unless the device is titled along the direction of the predefined channels. In this way, the liquid samples applied onto the device are handled as individual drops and could be stored, transported, and mixed on demand. Different from the conventional paper-based devices that use capillary force to drive liquid, our new device uses wetting and gravity as driving force. We name this operation principle suspending -droplet mode paper-based device (SD-pPAD). The use of a Teflon contact printing stamp makes the production of such devices rapid, cost efficient, and mass productive. Utilizing a Gquadruplex-based luminescence switch-on assay, we demonstrated rapid, convenient, highly sensitive, and low cost detection of lead(II) ions in water samples, using a custom made battery-powered portable device, and a smart phone as the detector.

AB Nanostructure-enhanced detection is promising for a number of applications such as early cancer diagnosis, environmental monitoring and mine safety, among which nanostructures integrated microfluidic chips offers unique advantage of ultra-low quantitative analyses. Here, dense ZnO nanowires of varied diameter and length were obtained by changing the content of polyethyleneimine (PEI) and growth time via simple hydrothermal growth in microfluidic channels for protein detection. We showed that this approach was superiorly efficient compared to the conventional hydrothermal method due to the flow-induced replenishment of nutrient and the effect of shear stress. When immobilizing FITC conjugated anti-bovine immunoglobulin G (IgG) on ZnO nanowires, the fluorescence emission was significantly amplified compared to glass substrate and ZnO seed layer. Under the different growth conditions, the most remarkable fluorescence enhancement was observed on the ZnO nanowire substrate grown for 3 h with 5 mM PEI in solution. It is ascribed not only to the increase of the binding surface area of proteins but also the intrinsic fluorescence enhancement of ZnO nanowires as waveguides. We further used the optimized ZnO nanowires to demonstrate multiple detection of cancer biomarkers, achieving a superior limit of detection (LOD) as low as 1 pg/mL in human a-fetoprotein (AFP) assay and 100 fg/mL in carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) assay with large dynamic range of 6-7 orders, which suggests that ZnO nanowire integrated microfluidic chips are promising for high -throughput fluorescence-based diagnostic assays.

AB Nanoparticle (NP) structure, compositing and the nature of the NP-functionalized electrode interface have a strong influence upon electrochemical properties that are critical in applications such as sensing, photocatalysis and electrocatalysis. Existing methods to fabricate NP-functionalized electrodes do not allow or precise control over all these variables, especially the NP-electrode interface, making it difficult to understand and predict how structural changes influence electrode activity and consequently limit the application. To conquer this problem, in this study, we fabricated a stepwise construction of a novel supramolecular stabilized gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) multilayer mediated by guest molecules, yielding 3D AuNPs assembly at the electrode interface. para-Sulfonatocalix[4]arene (pSC(4)), a water soluble macrocyclic synthetic receptor, has been served as a stabilizing ligand for preparation and gaining new insights into pSC(4) stabilized gold nanoparticles (pSC(4)-AuNPs) tethered on the electrode interface through host-guest interaction. We investigated the electrochemical properties of multilayer pSC(4)-AuNPs modified gold electrode using different core size of AuNPs with varying layer number. The electron transfer ability was characterized by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). Electrochemical signals are significantly enhanced through the layer-by-layer assembly of pSC(4)-AuNPs due to its high conductivity and high effective area. With this innovative method, by taking the assay of a tumor marker as an example, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (ErbB2) was successfully measured with a detection limit of 0.5 ng/mL. Taking the advantage of the pSC(4)-AuNPs muldlayer's good biocompatibility, high effective area and high electronic transmission, 3D AuNPs multilayer produced on the electrode interface suggests a portable synthetic pathway for the application into sensitive electrochemical biosensor.

AB This study demonstrates a novel strategy for colorimetric/fluorescent/surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) triple-mode sensing of nitrite based on Griess reaction modulated gold nanorods (GNRs)-Azo-gold nanoparticles (GNPs) (GNRs-Azo-GNPs) assembly. The p-aminothiophenol (PATP)-capped GNRs (GNRs@ PATP) and 1,8-diaminonaphthalene (DAP)-modified GNPs (GNPs@DAP) are first synthesized through Au-S and Au-N bonds, respectively. Upon being excited at 365 nm, the dispersion of GNRs-GNPs (GNRs@PATP and GNPs@DAP) emits cyan fluorescence. Next, the addition of nitrite into the GNRs-GNPs induces the formation of GNRs-Azo-GNPs assembly, resulting in the enhancement of color and decrease of fluorescence. Therefore, the GNRs-Azo-GNPs assembly can not only be used as a naked-eye indicator of nitrite changed from orange yellow to purple, but also as a highly selective "fluorescence quenching" probe due to the fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) between azo-moiety and DAP. The limit of detection (LOD) for nitrite is 0.05 mu M by colorimetry and 0.01 mu M by fluorescence. Meanwhile, the GNRs-Azo-GNPs assembly possesses controllable core satellites nanostructures and enables on-field SERS detection of nitrite with the LOD of 0.8 nM. More importantly, the GNRs-GNPs sensing system can not only be used as a paper-based test strip for on-site fast screening of nitrite with a high sensitivity and selectivity, but also as a SERS substrate for reliable quantitative analysis of nitrite. This study offers a new method for on-site visual detection of nitrite in human urine and meat products, as well as provides a strategy for designing multi-mode sensing platform for various applications.

AB Shewanella oneidensis, a model organism for electrochemical activity bacteria, has been widely studied at the biofilm level. However, to obtain more information regarding this species, it is essential to develop an approach to trap and detect S. oneidensis at the cell level. In this study, we report a rapid and label-free microfluidic platform for trapping, counting and detecting S. oneidensis cells. A microfluidic chip was integrated with a modified dielectrophoresis (DEP) trapping technique and hole arrays of different hole sizes. By numerical simulation and an elaborate electric field distribution design, S. oneidensis cells were successfully trapped and positioned in the hole arrays. Real time fluorescence imaging was also used to observe the trapping process. With the aid of a homemade image program, the trapped bacteria were accurately counted, and the results demonstrated that the amount of bacteria correlated with the hole sizes. As one of the significant applications of the device, Raman identification and detection of countable S. oneidensis cells was accomplished in two kinds of holes. The microfluidic platform provides a quantitative sample preparation and analysis method at the cell level that could be widely applied in the environmental and energy fields.

AB Electrochemical DNA biosensor has unique advantages for on-site pathogenic microorganism detection, yet the detection of long DNA towards genome DNA (gDNA) analysis remains challenge. In this work, we report a novel electrochemical biosensor for the ultrasensitive analysis of mecA DNA on methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) genome, using a multi-signal probes (MSP) system. The MSP consists of 7 biotin-labelled signal probes that will combine to the target DNA in a prehybridization step, and then the complex will be captured by a DNA tetrahedron structure probe (TSP) on the electrode surface. Then, after the introduction of the streptavidin-labelled HRP enzyme, a catalysis current signal is detected that is found to be corresponding to the concentration of the target DNA. MSP in this work plays a critical role not only for the signal amplification through bringing 7 biotins, but also dramatically improves the accessibility of the target sequence embedded in the double-strand DNA molecules and complex second structures. The 3-D DNA TSP here provides steady support and optimized surface density for the very "large" complex of MSP system and gDNA, as a base of the capture probe. Finally, as low as 10 fM synthetic target DNA was successfully detected, which is at least 3 magnitudes lower than that using single signal probe. Most importantly, we demonstrated the practicability of our analysis method by analyzing a 57 fM MRSA gDNA sample showing excellent selectivity, and the reliability of the analysis was also demonstrated by digital PCR.

AB Highly sensitive determination of tumor markers plays an important role in early diagnosis of cancer. Herein, a novel and ultrasensitive sandwich-type electrochemical immunosensor was fabricated for quantitative detection of prostate specific antigen (PSA). In this process, gold nanoparticles functionalized nitrogen-doped graphene quantum dots (Au@N-GQDs) was synthesized through a simple and green hydrothermal procedure to enhance conductivity, specific electrode surface area and quantity of immobilized primary antibodies (Abi). Subsequently, the prepared echinoidea-shaped nanocomposites (Au@Ag-Cu2O) composed of Au@Ag core shell nanoparticles and disordered cuprous oxide were prepared successfully to label the secondary antibodies (Ab(2)), which convened the advantages of good biocompatibility and high specific surface area. Because of the synergetic effect present in Au, Ag and Cu2O, the novel nanocomposites exhibited excellent electrocatalytic activity towards the reduction of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) for the amplified detection of PSA. Therefore, the as-proposed immunosensor for the detection of PSA possessed wide dynamic range from 0.01 pg/mL to 100 ng/ mL with a low detection limit of 0.003 pg/mL (S/N = 3). Furthermore, this sandwich-type immunosensor revealed high sensitivity, high selectivity and long-term stability, which had promising application in bioassay analysis.

AB Herein, bimetallic dendritic core-shell AuPd@Au nanocrystals (AuPd@Au NCs) were prepared by a simple one pot aqueous method using xanthine as a green growth-directing agent. By virtue of the enhanced peak currents in the H2O2 reduction catalyzed by AuPd@Au NCs, a label-free immunosensor was constructed for the detection of prostate specific antigen (PSA). The immunosensor exhibited significantly improved analytical performance for the assay of PSA with wide linear range of 0.1-50 ng mL(-1) and low detection limit of 0.078 ng mL(-1) (S/N = 3), coupled with the improved stability, reproducibility and selectivity. It provides a promising platform for clinical research and diagnosis.

AB A selective nonenzymatic glucose sensor was developed based on the direct oxidation of glucose on hierarchical CuCo bimetal-coated with a glucose-imprinted polymer (GIP). Glucose was introduced into the GIP composed of Nafion and polyurethane along with aminophenyl boronic acid (APBA), which was formed on the bimetal electrode formed on a screen-printed electrode. The extraction of glucose from the GIP allowed for the selective permeation of glucose into the bimetal electrode surface for oxidation. The GIP-coated bimetal sensor probe was characterized using electrochemical and surface analytical methods. The GIP layer coated on the NaOH pretreated bimetal electrode exhibited a dynamic range between 1.0 mu M and 25.0 mM with a detection limit of 0.65 +/- 0.10 mu M in phosphate buffer solution (pH 7.4). The anodic responses of uric acid, acetaminophen, dopamine, ascorbic acid, L-cysteine, and other saccharides (monosaccharides: galactose, mannose, fructose, and xylose; disaccharides: sucrose, lactose, and maltose) were not detected using the GIP-coated bimetal sensor. The reliability of the sensor was evaluated by the determination of glucose in artificial and whole blood samples.

AB The detection of E. coil O157:H7 in foods has held the attention of many researchers because of the seriousness attributed to this pathogen. In this study, we present a simple, sensitive, rapid and portable smartphone based fluorescence device for E. coil O157:H7 detection. This field-portable fluorescent imager on the smartphone involves a compact laser-diode-based photosource, a long-pass (LP) thin-film interference filter and a high quality insert lenses. The design of the device provided a low noise to background imaging system. Based on a sandwich ELISA and the specific recognition of antibody to E. coil O157:H7, the sensitive detection of E. coil O157:H7 were realized both in standard samples and real matrix in yoghurt and egg on our device. The detection limit are 1 CFU/mL and 10 CFU/mL correspondingly. Recovery percentages of spiked yogurt and egg samples with 10(3), 10(4) and 10(5) CFU/mL E. coli O157:H7 were 106.98, 96.52 and 102.65 (in yogurt) and 107.37, 105.64 and 93.84 (in egg) samples using our device, respectively. Most importantly, the entire process could be quickly completed within two hours. This smartphone based device provides a simple, rapid, sensitive detection platform for fluorescent imaging which applied in pathogen detection for food safety monitoring.

AB Novel peptidylated surfaces were designed to minimise interferences when electrochemically detecting cardiac troponin I in complex biological samples. Disulfide-cored peptide dendrons featuring carbomethoxy groups were self-assembled on gold electrodes. The carbomethoxy groups were deprotected to obtain carboxylic groups used to immobilise antibodies for cardiac troponin I marker. The chemisorption of two types of peptides, one containing triazole and the other with native peptide bonds, on a gold substrate was studied by quartz crystal microbalance (QCM), surface plasmon resonance (SPR) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Peptides formed ordered self-assembled monolayers, contributing to a more efficient display of the subsequently immobilised antibodies towards their binding to the antigen. As a result, electrochemical immunosensors prepared by self-assembly of peptides afforded higher sensitivities for cardiac troponin I than those prepared by the chemisorption of alkane thiolated compounds. Triazolic peptide-modified immunosensors showed extraordinary sensitivity towards cardiac troponin I [1.7 mu A/(ng/mL) in phosphate buffer], but suffered from surface fouling in 10% serum. Modification with non-triazolic peptides gave rise to anti-fouling properties and still enabled the detection of cardiac troponin I at pg/mL concentrations in 10% serum without significant matrix effects.

AB In this work, a label-free photoelectrochemical (PEC) immunosensor for the detection of carcino embryonic antigen (CEA) was developed based on CdS nanowires (NWs) sensitized WO3@BiOI heterostructure. The construction procedure of ITO/WO3@BIOI@CdS electrode was done by dipping the WO3@BiOI modified indium-tin oxide (ITO) electrode interchangeably into [Cd(NH3)(4)](2+) and S2- solution for several times. Then the ITO/WO3@BiOI@CdS electrode was used as a matrix for the subsequent immobilization of CEA antibody (Ab). The obtained label-free PEC immunosensor showed an excellent PEC performance toward CEA detection. Under optimal conditions, the PEC immunosensor have a sensitive response to CEA in a liner range of 0.01 ng/ mL to 50 ng/mL with a detection limit of 3.2 pg/mL. The proposed PEC immunosensor exhibited good stability, high sensitivity as well as reproducibility and storage stability. Moreover, the obtained PEC immunosensor also showed a satisfied result in human serum sample analysis.

AB N-hydroxyphthalimide (NHPI), a well known reagent in organic synthesis and biochemical applications, has been developed as a stable and efficient chemiluminescence coreactant for the first time. It reacts with luminol much faster than N-hydroxysuccinimide, eliminating the need of a prereaction coil used in N-hydroxysuccinimide system. Without using prereaction coil, the chemiluminescence peak intensities of luminol-NHPI system are about 102 and 26 times greater than that of luminol-N-hydroxysuccinimide system and classical luminol-hydrogen peroxide system, respectively. The luminol-NHPI system achieves the highly sensitive detection of luminol (LOD = 70 pM) and NHPI (LOD = 910 nM). Based on their excellent quenching efficiencies, superoxide dismutase and uric acid are sensitively detected with LODs of 3 ng/mL and 10 pM, respectively. Co2+ is also detected a LOD of 30 pM by its remarkable enhancing effect. Noteworthily, our method is at least 4 orders of magnitude more sensitive than previously reported uric acid detection methods, and can detect uric acid in human urine and Co2+ in tap and lake water real samples with excellent recoveries in the range of 96.35-102.70%. This luminol-NHPI system can be an important candidate for biochemical, clinical and environmental analysis.

AB As being the most extensively studied, non-coding, evolutionary conserved, post-transcriptional gene regulators of genome, microRNAs (miRNAs) have taken great attention among various disciplines due to their important roles in biological processes and link with cancer. Due to their diagnostic value, there have been many conventional methods used in detection of miRNAs including northern blotting, quantitative real time PCR (qRT-PCR) and microarray technology besides novel techniques based on various nanotechnology approaches and molecular biology tools including miRNA biosensors. The aim of this review is to explain the importance of miRNAs in biomedical field with an emphasis on early cancer diagnosis by overviewing both research based and commercially available miRNA detection methods in the last decade considering their strengths and weakness with an emphasis on miRNA biosensors.

AB Loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) is a DNA amplification approach characterized by high sensitivity and specificity. In "digital LAMP", small quantities of both template DNA and reagents are encapsulated within a droplet or microwell, allowing for analysis of precious nucleic acid samples in shorter amounts of time relative to traditional DNA amplification protocols (e.g., PCR) with an improved limit of detection. In this study, an integrated, self-driven microfluidic chip was designed to carry out digital LAMP. The entire quantification process could be automatically performed on this chip via capillary forces enabled through microwells comprised of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) surfaces coated with a hydrophilic film; no external pumps were required. Moreover, digitized droplets could be separated from each other by normally-closed microvalves. The contact angle of the hydrophilic film-coated PDMS surface was only 14.3 degrees. This is the first time that a rapid (30 min) and simple method has been used to create hydrophilic PDMS surfaces that allow for digital LAMP to be performed in a self-driven microfluidic device. As a proof of concept, amplification of a gene specific to a vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus strain was performed on the developed microfluidic chip within 30 min, and the limit of detection was only 11 copies with a volume of 30 mu L. This device may therefore become a promising tool for clinical diagnosis and point-of-care applications.

AB Gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) superlattice and small molecule dyes such as toluidine blue have remarkable effect on signal amplification. In this report, a label-free and simple electrochemical microRNA biosensor is developed by employing toluidine blue (TB) as a redox indicator and AuNPs superlattice as a support material. Conductive polymer, polypyrrole coated AuNPs was self-assembled to form a superlattice which exhibited the most close packed type thereby producing the maximum current. The successful immobilization of the single strand RNA (ss-RNA) probe and hybridization with the target microRNA sequence were confirmed by electrochemical cyclic voltammetry (CV) methods as well as differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) technique, which was used to determine the oxidation peak current of TB under optimal condition. TB with efficient signal amplification was applied in microRNA biosensor for the first time. By employing this strategy, microRNA can be detected in a range from 100 aM to 1 nM with a relatively low detection limit of 78 aM. Alongside the outstanding sensitivity and selectivity, this nanobiosensor had great reproducibility and showed a remarkable response in the real sample analysis with serum samples. In conclusion, the proposed electrochemical nanobiosensor could be clinically useful in the early detection of the breast cancer by direct detection of the serum microRNA-21 in real clinical samples without sample preparation, RNA extraction and/or amplification.

AB Triglycerides are clinically important marker for atherosclerosis, heart disease and hypertension. Here, a platform for detecting triglycerides in whole blood directly was developed based on hemocompatible epsilon-polylysine-heparin microparticles. The obtained products of e-polylysine-heparin microparticles were characterized by fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and zeta-potential. Moreover, the blood compatibility of e-polylysine-heparin microparticles was characterized by in vitro coagulation tests, hemolysis assay and whole blood adhesion tests. Considering of uniform particle size, good dispersibility and moderate long-term anticoagulation capability of the microparticles, a Lipase-(epsilon-polylysineheparin)-glassy carbon electrode (GCE) was constructed to detect triglycerides. The proposed biosensor had good electrocatalytic activity towards triglycerides, in which case the sensitivity was 0.40 mu A mg(-1) dL cm(-2) and the detection limit was 4.67 mg dL(-1) (S/N = 3). Meanwhile, the Lipase-(epsilon-polylysine-heparin)-GCE electrode had strong anti-interference ability as well as a long shelf-life. Moreover, for the detection of triglycerides in whole blood directly, the detection limit was as low as 5.18 mg dL(-1). The new constructed platform is suitable for detecting triglycerides in whole blood directly, which provides new analytical systems for clinical illness diagnosis.

AB An interferometric fiber sensor for detection of hexa-histidine tagged microcin (His-MccS) is reported and experimentally demonstrated. This intermodal fiber sensor is implemented by a no-core fiber (NCF) functionalized with chitosan (CS)-nickel (Ni) film for direct detection of small peptide: microcin. The fiber intermodal sensor relies on the refractive index modulations due to selective adsorption event at the chitosan (CS) -nickel (Ni) film. Owing to the strong affinity between Ni2+ ions and histidine, the immobilized Ni2+ ions in the chitosan film were utilized as binding agents for the direct detection of hexa-histidine tagged microcin. A comparative study in relation to different target size was conducted: full proteins trypsin, bovine serum albumin (BSA) and human serum albumin (HSA), with high histidine content on their surface and His-MccS (peptide, 11.6 kDa), have been employed for sensor evaluation. Results have shown selectivity for His-MccS relative to trypsin, BSA and HSA. The most telling contribution of this study is the fast detection of small biomolecule His-MccS compared to standard detection procedures like SDS-PAGE and western blot. The proposed sensor exhibits His-MccS detection sensitivity of 0.0308 nm/(ng/ml) in the range of (0-78) ng/ml with concentration detection limit of 0.8368 ng/ml.

AB Low-dimensional cobalt oxide codoped manganese oxide nanoparticles (CMO NPs; dia. similar to 25.6 nm) were synthesized using the hydrothermal method in alkaline phase. The optical, morphological, and structural properties of CMO NPs were characterized in details using FT-IR, UV/vis., FESEM, XEDS, XPS, TEM, and XRD techniques. Glassy carbon electrode (GCE) was fabricated with a thin-layer of CMO NPs by conducting coating binders for the development of selective and sensitive thiourea (TU) sensors. Electrochemical responses along with higher sensitivity, large-dynamic-range, and long-term stability towards TU were performed by electrochemical I-V approach. The calibration curve was found linear over a wide linear dynamic range (LDR) of TU concentration. From the gradient of the calibration plot, limit of detection (LOD), and sensitivity were calculated as 12.0 +/- 0.05 pM and 3.3772 nAnM(-1) cm(-2) respectively. It is an organized route for the development of chemical sensor based on very low-dimensional CMO NPs/GCE using electrochemical reduction phenomena. As far as we know, this report is the maiden publication on highly sensitive TU sensor based on the CMO NPs/GCE. This method could be a pioneer developer in TU sensitive chemical sensor development using doped NPs in the simple I-V method for the important sensor applications with useful doped materials coupled nano technological systems for environmental safety.

AB Cell adhesion is an essential aspect of cellular behavior. Finding innovative methods to probe the adhesion of cells in their native state can greatly advance the understanding of control and regulation of cellular behavior and their impact on human health. The quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) is a label-free, biosensing system that has, in the past fifty years, evolved from a simple acoustic based mass sensor to a powerful bioanalytical tool. Its unique capability of monitoring the cell-substrate interaction non-invasively in real time has led to the emergence of its applications in areas that are relevant to fundamental cell biology and medical research. This review is intended to provide readers an overview of the use of the QCM for examination of cell-substrate adhesion. It also describes how this innovative approach can be extended to the study of other aspects of cellular behavior, such as cell morphology, cell mechanics, cell motility, cell signaling, all of which can potentially be applied to medical diagnosis and/or pharmaceutical development. In this review a major emphasis is placed on informing readers about some of the most important practical aspects of the QCM-based cell study including data acquisition and analysis, the substrate surface manipulation, and cell manipulation.

AB A visual colorimetric microfluidic paper-based analytical device ( PAD) was constructed following the direct synthesis of enzyme-inorganic hybrid nanomaterials on the paper matrix. An inorganic solution of MnSO4 and KH2PO4 containing a diluted enzyme (glucose oxidase, GOx) was subsequently pipetted onto cellulose paper for the in situ growth of GOx@Mn-3(PO4)(2) hybrid functional materials. The characterization of the morphology and chemical composition validated the presence of hybrid materials roots in the paper fiber, while the Mn-3(PO4)(2) of the hybrid provided both a surface for enzyme anchoring and a higher peroxidase-like catalytic activity as compared to the Mn-3(PO4)(2) crystal that was synthesized without enzyme modulation. This new approach for the in situ growth of an enzyme-inorganic hybrid on a paper matrix eliminates centrifugation and the dry process by casting the solution on paper. The sensing material loading was highly reproducible because of the accuracy and stability of pipetting, which eventually contributed to the reliability of the PAD. The self-assembled natural and artificial enzyme hybrid on the RPADs specifically detected glucose from a group of interferences, which shows great specificity using this method. Moreover, the colorimetric signal exhibited detection limitation for glucose is 0.01 mM, which lies in the physiological range of glucose in biological samples.

AB MicroRNAs (MiRNAs) play multiple crucial regulating roles in cell which can regulate one third of protein coding genes. MiRNAs participate in the developmental and physiological processes of human body, while their aberrant adjustment will be more likely to trigger diseases such as cancers, kidney disease, central nervous system diseases, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, viral infections and so on. What's worse, for the detection of miRNAs, their small size, high sequence similarity, low abundance and difficult extraction from cells impose great challenges in the analysis. Hence, it's necessary to fabricate accurate and sensitive biosensing platform for miRNAs detection. Up to now, researchers have developed many signal-amplification strategies for miRNAs detection, including hybridization chain reaction, nuclease amplification, rolling circle amplification, catalyzed hairpin assembly amplification and nanomaterials based amplification. These methods are typical, feasible and frequently used. In this review, we retrospect recent advances in signal amplification strategies for detecting miRNAs and point out the pros and cons of them. Furthermore, further prospects and promising developments of the signal-amplification strategies for detecting miRNAs are proposed.

AB Fabrication and characterization of a surface plasmon resonance based fiber optic xanthine sensor using entrapment of xanthine oxidase (XO) enzyme in several nanostructures of tantalum (v) oxide (Ta2O5) have been reported. Chemical route was adopted for synthesizing Ta2O5 nanoparticles, nanorods, nanotubes and nanowires while Ta2O5 nanofibers were prepared by electrospinning technique. The synthesized Ta2O5 nanostructures were characterized by photoluminescence, scanning electron microscopy, UV Visible spectra and X-ray diffraction pattern. The probes were fabricated by coating an unclad core of the fiber with silver layer followed by the deposition of XO entrapped Ta2O5 nanostructures. The crux of sensing mechanism relies on the modification of dielectric function of sensing layer upon exposure to xanthine solution of diverse concentrations, reflected in terms of shift in resonance wavelength. The sensing probe coated with XO entrapped Ta2O5 nanofibers has been turned out to possess maximum sensitivity amongst the synthesized nanostructures. The probe was optimized in terms of pH of the sample and the concentration of XO entrapped in Ta2O5 nanofibers. The optimized sensing probe possesses a remarkably good sensitivity of 26.2 mu m/M in addition to linear range from 0 to 3 mu M with an invincible LOD value of 0.0127 mu M together with a response time of 1 min. Furthermore, probe selectivity with real sample analysis ensure the usage of the sensor for practical scenario. The results reported open a novel perspective towards a sensitive, rapid, reliable and selective detection of xanthine.

AB It is important to precisely monitor mercury (II) ions (He) for environment protection and human health monitoring. Although many strategies have been developed in the past decades, there still remains a challenge for developing an ultrasensitive, simple and reliable approach to detect Hg2+. Herein, we report a ratiometric surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) aptasensor by employing aptamer-modified Au@Ag core-shell nanoparticles (Au@Ag NPs) as highly functional sensing probes, allowing for ultrasensitive detection of Hg2+. In principle, the thiolated 5 '-Cy3 labeled aptamer probe (Cy3-aptamer) is firstly immobilized on the SERS substrate surface and then hybridizes with the 5 '-Rox labeled complementary DNA (cDNA) to form a rigid double-stranded DNA (dsDNA), in which the Cy3 and Rox Raman labels are used to produce the ratiometric Raman signals. In the presence of Hg2+, the aptamer DNA turns into the thymine (T)-Hg2+-T mediated hairpin structure, leading to the dissociation of dsDNA. As a result, the Rox labels are away from the Au@Ag NP SERS substrate while Cy3 labels are close to it. Therefore, the intensity of SERS signal from Cy3 labels increases while that from Rox labels decreases. The ratio between the Raman intensities of Cy3 labels and Rox labels is linear with Hg2+ concentrations in the range from 0.001 to 1.0 nM, and the limit of detection is estimated to be 0.4 pM. The proposed strategy provides a new rapid, simple and reliable approach for sensitive detection of Hg2+ and may create a universal methodology for developing analogous aptasensors for a wide range of other analytes determination.

AB An ultrasensitive sandwiched electrochemiluminescence (ECL) immunosensor was developed for 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) detection in genomic DNA by using Fe3O4@SiO2 core-shell magnetic nanomaterial as a immobilization matrix for anti-5hmC antibody, PAMAM conjugated avidin and Ru(bpy)(2)(phen-5-NH2) (PF6)(2) as signal amplification unit. Importantly, Fe3O4@SiO2 nanoparticles were verified to not only possess enormous surface for loading antibody by amido link, but also exhibit excellent bioactivity. With the dual signal amplification strategy, the ECL immunosensor showed wide detection range from 0.1 to 30 nM with low detection limit of 0.047 nM (S/N = 3). Based on the specific immunoreaction, the developed method also illustrated excellent detection selectivity. The fabricated immunosensor was also applied to detect the 5hmC in genomic DNA of cancer tissue, which indicated that the immunosensor possess potential applications in clinical detection.

AB According to the recent statistics, Salmonella is still an important public health issue in the whole world. Legislated reference methods, based on counting plate methods, are sensitive enough but are inadequate as an effective emergency response tool, and are far from a rapid device, simple to use out of lab. An overview of the commercially available rapid methods for Salmonella detection is provided along with a critical discussion of their limitations, benefits and potential use in a real context. The distinguished potentialities of electrochemical biosensors for the development of rapid devices are highlighted. The state-of-art and the newest technologic approaches in electrochemical biosensors for Salmonella detection are presented and a critical analysis of the literature is made in an attempt to identify the current challenges towards a complete solution for Salmonella detection in microbial food control based on electrochemical biosensors.

AB Herein, we reported a disposable electroanalytical device for competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) of phenylethanolamine A (PA). Conductive carbon tape coated with gold cluster served as the working electrode, while the counter and reference electrodes were fabricated on the filter paper by the screen-printing technique. Separating fabrication of the working electrode from other electrodes could make it possible for full utilization of the working electrode modification in bulk and no contamination of the immune-reagents on the counter and reference electrodes. The gold cluster played an important role in both immobilizing antigen and accelerating electron transfer. The eight-channel" devices were utilized to detect PA on the strategy of competitive ELISA. The detection range and the limit of detection (LOD) using differential pulse voltammetry for PA were 0.005-60 ng mL(-1) and 2.6 pg mL(-1), respectively. And also, the linear range for PA performed by square wave voltammetry was 0.05-60 ng mL(-1) with the LOD value as 0.028 ng The results clearly demonstrated that the proposed electroanalytical devices could be successfully applied in immunoassay and might be further developed for determination of different analytes based on ELISA format.

AB In this work, we have developed an electrochemical aptasensor for high-sensitivity determination of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) based on lead ion (Pb2+)-dependent DNAzyme-assisted signal amplification and graphene quantum dot-ionic liquid-nafion (GQDs-IL-NF) composite film. We designed hairpin DNA containing CEA-specific aptamers and DNAzyme chains. In the presence of CEA, hairpin DNA recognized the target and performed a DNAzyme-assisted signal amplification reaction to yield a large number of single stranded DNA. The GQDs-IL-NF composite film was immobilized on the glassy carbon electrode for the interaction with single-stranded DNA through noncovalent pi-pi stacking interaction. Therefore, the methylene blue-labeled substrate DNA (MB-substrate) was fixed on the electrode and exhibited an initial electrochemical signal. Under optimal conditions, the response current change was proportional to the concentration of CEA, demonstrating a wide linear range from 0.5 fg mL(-1) to 0.5 ng mL(-1), with a low detection limit of 0.34 fg mL(-1). Furthermore, the proposed aptasensor was successfully applied in determining CEA in serum samples, showing its superior prospects in clinical diagnosis.

AB Rapid and efficient detecting trace amount of environmental p-nitroaniline (p-NA) is in urgent need for security concerns and pollution supervision. In this work we report the use of molecularly imprinted polymeric ionic liquid (MIPIL) microspheres to construct recognizable surfaces for detection of p-NA through fluorescence quenching. The p-NA imprinted microspheres are synthesized by precipitation polymerization upon copolymerization of 3-(anthracen-9-ylmethyl)-1-vinyl-1H-imidazol-3-ium chloride (Fluorescent IL monomer) with ethyleneglycol dimethacrylate (EGDMA). The electron-rich group alkenyl imidazole in IL functional monomer can dramatically improve the emission of anthracene fluorophore and the pi-pi stacking, electronic, and hydrogen bond between p-NA and MIPIL can efficiently enhance the selective recognition force. The as synthesized MIPIL microspheres present spherical shape, high fluorescence emission intensity and specific recognition, which showed rapid detection rate (1 min), stable reusable property (at least 4 time recycles), wonderful selectivity over several structural analogs, wide linear range (10 nM to 10 M) with a correlation coefficient of 0.992, and excellent sensitivity (LOD, 9 nM). As synthesis and surface functionalization of MIPIL microspheres are well established, the methods reported in this work are facile, rapid and efficient for monitoring p-NA in environmental wastewater.

AB Globally, waterborne organisms are the primary causative agents for the transmission of various forms of diarrheal diseases. For accurate diagnosis, molecular tools have gained considerable attention in the recent past. Molecular tools require DNA as the starting material for diagnosis, and hence, a prerequisite is the quality and integrity of DNA. To obtain high quality DNA rapidly, we have fabricated a microchip in poly(dimethyl siloxane) (PDMS) by soft lithography process. The microchip facilitated in-flow coating of chitosan on the magnetic nanoparticles, which under external mechanical vibration caused cell lysis and released DNA in the supernatant. The released DNA was captured by the nanoparticles owing to its positive charge (chitosan coating). The magnetic nanoparticle-DNA complex was then isolated from the in-flow matrix using permanent magnet, Further, removal of the cell debris, proteins, and carbohydrates was done using wash buffer. DNA extracted using the microchip was pure with absorbance (260/280) ratio of 1.77 +/- 0.04, as compared to 1.79 +/- 0.03 obtained by TRIzol method. The complete isolation of the DNA using the microchip took 15 min as against > 2 h with a TRIzol method. Six gram-negative waterborne pathogens were used to demonstrate the efficacy of the microchip based DNA extraction process. The integrity of the isolated DNA was assessed by amplifying the 16S rRNA gene using Coml and Com2 universal primers. The presence of a band at 407 bp on gel electrophoresis confirmed the amplified product. Further, the gel image was used for quantification of the amplified product using ImageJ software. Higher regression values obtained using microchip confirmed better quality and integrity of the extracted DNA as opposed to the conventional method. The lower (< 2%) relative standard deviation values obtained from the data suggested that the microchip process was reproducible. The quality and integrity of the obtained DNA proved the simplicity, rapidity, and sensitivity of the microchip-assisted DNA extraction process.

AB This article describes a 3D microfluidic paper-based analytical device that can be used to conduct an enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The device comprises two parts: a sliding strip (which contains the active sensing area) and a structure surrounding the sliding strip (which holds stored reagents-buffers, antibodies, and enzymatic substrate-and distributes fluid). Running an ELISA involves adding sample (e.g. blood) and water, moving the sliding strip at scheduled times, and analyzing the resulting color in the sensing area visually or using a flatbed scanner. We demonstrate that this device can be used to detect C-reactive protein (CRP)-a biomarker for neonatal sepsis, pelvic inflammatory disease, and inflammatory bowel diseases-at a concentration range of 1-100 ng/mL in 1000-fold diluted blood (1-100 mu g/mL in undiluted blood). The accuracy of the device (as characterized by the area under the receiver operator characteristics curve) is 89% and 83% for cutoffs of 10 ng/mL (for neonatal sepsis and pelvic inflammatory disease) and 30 ng/mL (for inflammatory bowel diseases) CRP in 1000-fold diluted blood respectively. In resource-limited settings, the device can be used as a part of a kit (containing the device, a fixed-volume capillary, a pre-filled tube, a syringe, and a dropper); this kit would cost similar to $0.50 when produced in large scale (>100,000 devices/week). This kit has the technical characteristics to be employed as a pre-screening tool, when combined with other data such as patient history and clinical signs.

AB Point-of-care (POC) diagnostics are one of the quick and sensitive detection approaches used in current clinical applications, but always face a performance tradeoff between time-to-result and assay sensitivity. One critical setting where these limitations are evident is the detection of sepsis, where 6-10 mL of whole blood may contain as little as one bacterial colony forming unit (cfu). The large sample volume, complex nature of the sample and low analyte concentration necessitates signal enhancement using culture-based or molecular amplification techniques. In the time-critical diagnosis of sepsis, waiting for up to 24 h to produce sufficient DNA for analysis is not possible. As a consequence, there is a need for integrated sample preparation methods that could enable shorter detection times, whilst maintaining high analytical performance. We report the development of a culture-free bacterial enrichment method to concentrate bacteria from whole blood in less than 3 h. The method relies on triple-enrichment steps to magnetically concentrate bacterial cells and their DNA with a 500-fold reduction in sample volume (from 10 to 0.02 mL). Using this sample preparation method, sensitive qPCR detection of the extracted S. aureus bacterial DNA was achieved with a detection limit of 5 0.58 cfu/mL within a total elapsed time of 4 h; much faster than conventional culture-based approaches. The method could be fully automated for integration into clinical practice for point-of-care or molecular detection of bacterial DNA from whole blood.

AB A series of nanocomposites comprised of homogeneous mesoporous carbon nanospheres embedded with SnOx (x = 0, 1, or 2) and TiO2 nanocrystals using bovine serum albumin (BSA) as template followed by calcinated at different temperatures (300, 500, 700, and 900 degrees C) were prepared, and were denoted as SnOx@TiO2@mC. Then a novel electrochemical biosensing strategy for detecting tobramycin (TOB) based on the nanocomposites was constructed. The as-prepared SnOx@TiO2@mC nanocomposites not only possess high specific surface area and good electrochemical activity but also exhibit strong bioaffinity with the aptamer strands, therefore, they were applied as the scaffold for anchoring TOB-targeted aptamer and further used to sensitively detect trace TOB in aqueous solutions. By comparing the electrochemical biosensing responses toward TOB detection based on the four SnOx@TiO2@mC nanocomposites, the biosensing system constructed with SnOx@TiO2@mC(900) (derived at 900 degrees C) demonstrated the highest determination efficiency, high selectivity, and good stability. In particular, the new proposed aptasensing method based on SnOx@TiO2@mC nanocomposite exhibits considerable potential for the quantitative detection of TOB in the biomedical field.

AB Electroanalysis of myoglobin (Mb) in 10 plasma samples of healthy donors (HDs) and 14 plasma samples of patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) was carried out with screen-printed electrodes modified first with multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT) and then with a molecularly imprinted polymer film (MIP), viz., myoglobin-imprinted electropolymerized poly(o-phenylenediamine). The differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) parameters, such as a maximum amplitude of reduction peak current (A, nA), a reduction peak area (S, nA x V), and a peak potential (P, V), were measured for the MWCNT/MIP-sensors after their incubation with non diluted plasma. The relevance of the multi-parameter electrochemical data for accurate discrimination between HDs and patients with AMI was assessed on the basis of electrochemical threshold values (this requires the reference standard method (RAMP immunoassay)) or alternatively on the basis of the computational cluster assay (this does not require any reference standard method). The multi-parameter electrochemical analysis of biosamples combined with computational cluster assay was found to provide better accuracy in classification of plasma samples to the groups of HDs or AMI patients.

AB Mobile sensing based on the integration of microfluidic device and smartphone, so-called MS2 technology, has enabled many applications over recent years, and continues to stimulate growing interest in both research communities and industries. In particular, it has been envisioned that MS2 technology can be developed for various cell functional assays to enable basic research and clinical applications. Toward this direction, in this paper, we describe the development of a MS2-based cell functional assay for testing cell migration (the Midt). The system is constructed as an integrated test kit, which includes microfluidic chips, a smartphone-based imaging platform, the phone apps for image capturing and data analysis, and a set of reagent and accessories for performing the cell migration assay. We demonstrated that the Mkit can effectively measure purified neutrophil and cancer cell chemotaxis. Furthermore, neutrophil chemotaxis can be tested from a drop of whole blood using the Midt with red blood cell (RBC) lysis. The effects of chemoattractant dose and gradient profile on neutrophil chemotaxis were also tested using the Midt. In addition to research applications, we demonstrated the effective use of the Mkit for on-site test at the hospital and for testing clinical samples from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patient. Thus, this developed Mkit provides an easy and integrated experimental platform for cell migration related research and potential medical diagnostic applications.

AB An efficient quenching electrochemiluminescence (ECL) immunosensor based on ECL resonance energy transfer (ECL-RET) was studied for sensitive analysis of prostate specific antigen (PSA). In this protocol, nitrogen-doped graphene quantum dots (NGQDs) which could produce excellent ECL emission, were loaded onto Ni(OH)(2) with the three-dimensional (3D) hierarchical and stacked lamellar structure. Taking advantages of high conductivity and large specific surface area of Ni(OH)(2), the better electrochemical and ECL behavior of Ni(OH)(2)/NGQDs were presented. As another part of immunosensor, the Fe3O4@MnO2 composites with wider ultraviolet absorption range were successfully assembled. The absorption spectra of Fe3O4@MnO2 precisely overlapped with the ECL spectra of NGQDs, leading to the significant decrement of ECL signal. Herein, the sandwich-type immunosensor was developed based on the quenching mechanism between NGQDs (ECL donor) and Fe3O4@MnO2 (ECL acceptor). The system was optimized to realize reliable determination of PSA concentration within the linear range of 10(-5)-10 ng/mL and a detection limit of 5 fg/mL (S/N = 3). Eminently, the developed method was successfully applied in real serum samples with good recoveries in a range from 94.0% to 102%, indicating the good accuracy of the proposed method for PSA detection.

AB Microfluidic devices constructed using low cost materials presents as alternative for conventional flow analysis systems because they provide advantages as low consumption of reagents and samples, high speed of analysis, possibility of portability and the easiness of construction and maintenance. Herein, is described for the first time the use of an electrochemical biosensor for phenol detection combined with a very simple and efficient microfluidic device based on commercial textile threads. Taking advantages of capillary phenomena and gravity forces, the solution transportation is promoted without any external forces or injection pump. Screen printed electrodes were modified with carbon nanotubes/gold nanoparticles followed by covalent binding of tyrosinase. After the biosensor electrochemical characterization by cyclic voltammetry technique, the optimization of relevant parameters such as pH, potential of detection and linear range for the biosensor performance was carried out; the system was evaluated for analytical phenol detection presenting limit of detection and limit of quantification 2.94 nmol L-1 and 8.92 nmol L-1 respectively. The proposed system was applied on phenol addition and recovery studies in drinking water, obtaining recoveries rates between 90% and 110%.

AB Transmission surface plasmon resonance (TSPR) is an unusual extraordinary optical transmission that is more transparent at certain wavelengths than expected by classical theory. The three main plasmonic structures that providing this phenomenon are nanohole arrays, diffraction gratings, and nanoslit arrays. This extraordinary optical transmission phenomenon is produced as a result of surface plasmon excitations. The shifting in TSPR responses upon changing of dielectric environment at the surface of a metallic film was observed. After TSPR was discovered from metallic nanohole arrays in 1998, the number of papers about this topic rapidly increased. In the 20 years since, TSPR has been utilized to improve the detection limits, sensitivity, selectivity, and dynamic range of biosensing devices, resulting in them having greater potential for commercialization. This review gives a broad overview of the TSPR phenomenon, the development of this technique, and the typical experimental setups used to acquire TSPR signals; it also describes how they are applied in the field of research into biosensors.

AB In this work, single Au nanowire electrodes (AuNWEs) were fabricated by laser-assisted pulling/hydrofluoric acid (HF) etching process, which then were characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), electrochemical method and finite-element simulation. The as-prepared single AuNWEs were used to construct electrochemical aptamer-based nanosensors (E-AB nanosensors) based on the formation of Au-S bond that duplex DNA tagged with methylene blue (MB) was modified on the surface of electrode. In the presence of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the MB-labeled aptamer dissociated from the duplex DNA due to the strong specific affinity between aptamer and target, which lead to the reduction of MB electrochemical signals. Moreover, BSA was employed to further passivate electrode surface bonding sites for the stable of the sensor. The as-prepared E-AB nanosensor has been used for ATP assay with excellent sensitivity and selectivity, even in a complex system like cerebrospinal fluid of rat brain. Considering the unique properties of good stability, larger surface area and smaller overall dimensions, this E-AB nanosensor should be an ideal platform for widely sensing applications in living bio-system.

AB A novel glycoprotein imprinting strategy was proposed and was applied to the detection of the carbohydrate antigen 19-9. The glycosylated complex of glycoprotein was used as template to construct a glycosyl imprinted sensor. The eluted imprinted cavities showed good affinity for template glycosyls and glycoproteins carrying template glycosyl. The effect of template saccharide structure on glycosyl imprinted sensors is further discussed. More complex template structures can lead to better sensor performance including selectivity and sensitivity. As a result, the polysaccharide imprinted sensor showed preeminent linear response to CA19-9 in the range of 0.1-5 U/mL, with a detection limit of 0.028 U/mL (3 delta/K), while the linear of the monosaccharide imprinted sensor was 1-60 U/mL and the detection limit was 0.17 U/mL. The complex structure on the template surface provides more possibilities for the recognition of the template molecules, consequently, led to the significant anti-interference capability of the polysaccharide imprinted sensor. Furthermore, recoveries ranging from 93.0% to 103.5% were achieved when human serum samples were assayed using the polysaccharide imprinted sensor.

AB Versatile, simple and efficient sample preparation is desirable for point-of-care testing of emerging diseases such as zoonoses, but current sample preparation assays are insensitive, labour-intensive and time-consuming and require multiple instruments. We developed a single-tube sample preparation approach involving direct pathogen enrichment and extraction from human specimens using diatomaceous earth (DE). Amine-modified DE was used to directly enrich a zoonotic pathogen, Brucella, in a large sample volume. Next, a complex of amine-modified DE and dimethyl suberimidate was used for nucleic acid extraction from the enriched pathogen. Using our single-tube approach, the pathogen can be enriched and extracted within 60 min at a level of 1 colony formation unit (CFU) from a 1 ml sample volume in the same tube. The performance of this approach is 10-100 times better than that of a commercial kit (10(2) to 10(3) CFU/ml) but does not require a large centrifuge. Finally, we combined the single-tube approach with a bio-optical sensor for rapid and accurate zoonotic pathogen detection in human urine samples. Using the combination system, Brucella in human urine can be efficiently enriched (similar to 8-fold) and the detection limit is enhanced by up to 100 times (1 CFU/ml bacteria in urine) compared with the commercial kit. This combined system is fast and highly sensitive and thus represents a promising approach for disease diagnosis in the clinical setting.

AB Bioluminescence has been widely used for important biosensing applications such as the measurement of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the energy unit in biological systems and an indicator of vital processes. The current technology for detection is mainly based on large equipment such as readers and imaging systems, which require intensive and time-consuming procedures. A miniaturised bioluminescence sensing system, which would allow sensitive and continuous monitoring of ATP, with an integrated and low-cost disposable microfluidic chamber for handling of biological samples, is highly desirable. Here, we report the design, fabrication and testing of 3D printed microfluidics chips coupled with silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs) for high sensitive real-time ATP detection. The 3D microfluidic chip reduces reactant consumption and facilitates solution delivery close to the SiPM to increase the detection efficiency. Our system detects ATP with a limit of detection (LoD) of 8 nM and an analytical dynamic range between 15 nM and 1 mu M, showing a stability error of 3%, and a reproducibility error below of 20%. We demonstrate the dynamic monitoring of ATP in a continuous flow system exhibiting a fast response time, similar to 4 s, and a full recovery to the baseline level within 17 s. Moreover, the SiPM-based bioluminescence sensing system shows a similar analytical dynamic range for ATP detection to that of a full-size PerkinElmer laboratory luminescence reader.

AB The purpose of overviewing research and development status of dependable, efficient, and portable and miniaturized surface acoustic wave (SAW) is to propose practical devices for biosensing and medical diagnosis. SAW Love-mode sensors fortunately have a great deal of attention during last two decades. Several periodic structure models of SAW devices were reviewed, especially interdigital transducers (IDTs), wave guiding layers, patterned-ZnO. SAW devices based on such periodic wave guiding layers and patterned-ZnO were demonstrated with superior performance, much better than conventional SAW devices. Both 2D and 3D models of phononic-crystal-based SAW devices can be respectively fabricated by an array of periodic cylindrical holes and pillars, which allowed SAW devices to have both higher Q-factor and GHz-level frequency. Ring waveguide and spherical SAW devices would have potential applications and implementation in biosensing. ZnO is one of attractive guiding-layer Materials. Its nanostructures, such as nanowires, nanorods and nanofibers provided with excellent properties, will make nanoscaled SAW devices contribute to be much more sensitive in biosensors. A range of applications based on SAW and ZnO guiding-layer would be therefore expected among of immunochemical analysis, in-situ virus or bacteria determination, microfluidic automation, and cell manipulation.

AB Dark-field microscope (DFM) analysis of nanoparticle binding signal is highly useful for a variety of research and biomedical applications, but current applications for nanoparticle quantification rely on expensive DFM systems. The cost, size, limited robustness of these DFMs limits their utility for non-laboratory settings. Most nanoparticle analyses use high-magnification DFM images, which are labor intensive to acquire and subject to operator bias. Low-magnification DFM image capture is faster, but is subject to background from surface artifacts and debris, although image processing can partially compensate for background signal. We thus mated an LED light source, a dark-field condenser and a 20x objective lens with a mobile phone camera to create an inexpensive, portable and robust DFM system suitable for use in non-laboratory conditions. This proof-of concept mobile DFM device weighs less than 400 g and costs less than $2000, but analysis of images captured with this device reveal similar nanoparticle quantitation results to those acquired with a much larger and more expensive desktop DFMM system. Our results suggest that similar devices may be useful for quantification of stable, nanoparticle-based activity and quantitation assays in resource-limited areas where conventional assay approaches are not practical.

AB The analysis of antioxidants in foodstuffs has become an active area of research, leading to the recent development of numerous methods for assessing antioxidant capacity. Here we described the fabrication and validation of a novel and simple cell-based electrochemical biosensor for this purpose. The biosensor is used to assess the antioxidant capacity of cell-free extracts from Lactobacillus plantarum strains isolated from Chinese dry-cured ham. The biosensor relies on the determination of cellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) (the flux of H2O2 released from RAW 264.7 macrophage cells) to indirectly assess changes in intracellular oxidative stress level as influenced by L. plantarum strains. A one-step acidified manganese dioxide (a-MnO2) modified gold electrode (GE) was used to immobilize RAW 264.7 macrophage cells, which were then encapsulated in a 3D cell culture system consisting of alginate/ graphene oxide (NaAlg/GO). The biosensor exhibited a rapid and sensitive response for the detection of H2O2 released from RAW264.7 cells. The detection limit was 0.02 mu M with a linear response from 0.05 mu M to 0.85 mu M and the biosensor was shown to have good stability and outstanding repeatability. This technique was then used for evaluating the antioxidant ability of extracts from L. plantarum NJAU-01. According to the electrochemical investigations and assays of SEM, TEM, and ROS, these cell-free extracts effectively reduced the oxidative stress levels in RAW264.7 cells under external stimulation. Extracts from L. plantarum strains at a dose of 10(10) CFU/mL showed the highest antioxidant activities with a relative antioxidant capacity (RAC) rate of 88.94%. Hence, this work provides a simple and efficient electrochemical biosensing platform based on RAW264.7 cells for fast, sensitive and quantitative assessment of antioxidant capacity of L. plantarum strains. The method demonstrates its potential for rapid screening for evaluating antioxidant properties of samples.

AB Enzyme inhibition based drug screening strategy has been widely employed for new drug discovery. But this strategy faces some challenges in practical application especially for the trace active compound screening from natural products such as the stability of enzyme and the sensitivity of screening approach. Inspired by the above, we for the first time demonstrate the self-assembly of a-glucosidase (GAA) and glucose oxidase (GOx) into one multi-enzymes-inorganic nanoreactor with hierarchical structure (flower shape). The hybrid enzyme nanoreactor enjoys the merits including the character of assembly line, the enhanced enzymatic activity and robust stability. The flower shape of enzyme nanoreactor possessed a bigger specific surface area, facilitating the trace GAA inhibitor detection. Based on the above, we proposed an enzyme nanoreactor mediated plasmonic sensing strategy for anti-diabetic drug screening. First, maltose was chosen as the substrate for GAA and the generated glucose were immediately utilized by GOx to generate H2O2, and finally, H2O2 etched the Ag nanoprism to round nanodiscs, resulting in the blue shift of surface plasmon resonance (SPR) absorption band. With the aid of hybrid enzyme nanoreactor guided SPR, the ultrasensitive screening of GAA inhibitor (i.e. anti-diabetic drug) can be realized with the detection limit of 5 nM for acarbose. The proposed approach was successfully utilized for GAA inhibitor screening from natural products. We anticipate that the proposed sensing method may provide new insights and inspirations in the enzyme inhibition based drug discovery and clinical diagnosis.

AB Label-free biosensors are ideally suited for the quantitative analysis of specific interactions among biomolecules or of biomolecules with drugs, as well as for quantitation of diagnostic markers in biofluids. In contrast to the label-dependent methods, a new assay for a particular prey molecule can be set up within few minutes by immobilizing the corresponding bait molecule on the sensor surface, using one of the common immobilization procedures. Unfortunately, the extensive application of label-free biosensors is still hampered by the fact that the immobilization of the bait molecule is usually irreversible; for that reason, a new chip (which is expensive) is required for every successful or futile attempt. Here, we present a general method for the Switchable immobilization of biotinylated bait molecules on a new desthiobiotin surface, using wild-type streptavidin as a robust bridge between the chip and the biotinylated bait. The immobilization of the bait is very stable, so that many cycles of prey injection and subsequent prey removal can be carried out. For the latter, common reagents like HCl, Na2CO3, glycine buffer, or SDS are employed. When desired, however, streptavidin plus the biotinylated bait can be completely removed by 3 min injections of biotin, guanidinium thiocyanate, pepsin, and SDS, which makes it possible to immobilize new biotinylated bait. The number of in situ regeneration cycles is unlimited during the lifetime of the chip (2-3 weeks). One chip can easily be shared by many users with unrelated tasks (as is typical in academics), or used for the fully automated screening of many different interactions (for example in pharmaceutical research). In comparison to other regenerative chips, the new chip surface has much wider applicability and all of its structural and functional parameters have been disclosed.
